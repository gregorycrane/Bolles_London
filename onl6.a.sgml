   <P>Having   now   completed our survey of the        West End and of the northern suburbs of London, it will be necessary for us again to take in hand our pilgrim staff, and to make a fresh start, with a view of reconnoitring that large and interesting district which, though it lies   on   the southern   bank   of   the   Thames, forms, and has formed for centuries, an integral part of this great metropolis. We will therefore do so without further delay, and only ask our   readers   to   accompany   us   mentally   to <pb id="p.2" n="2"> London Bridge, from the south end of which it is our purpose to commence our peregrinations, which in this, the concluding volume of the work, will be mainly confined to the metropolitan and strictly suburban districts in the county of Surrey; for we have not forgotten the promise with which we set out on our wanderings, to confine ourselves to those regions, be they greater or smaller in extent, from   which can be seen <QUOTE>the glimmer of the gilded cross of St. Paul's.</QUOTE> 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.2.1">St. Peter's Church, Park Street, Southwark</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>The district which we are about to traverse, though not equal in its reminiscences to the City of Westminster, will be found on examination to be full of antiquarian interest. In St. Saviour's Priory Church, in Bermondsey Abbey, in the old <QUOTE>Tabard</QUOTE> Inn, in the Globe and other theatres on Bankside, in the archiepiscopal palace at Lambeth, in the once royal palace at Kennington, in the Mint and the old Marshalsea, we shall find a rich mine of archaeological wealth, and <num value="1">one</num> which it will take a long time to exhaust. At Deptford we shall again meet with our old friends, Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn; at Greenwich we shall see our Tudor kings and queens in the midst of a splendid court; on Blackheath we shall meet Wat Tyler and his rebel bands; at Newington Butts we shall witness the cavalcade of the Canterbury Pilgrims, as they wend their way along the old road into Kent; at Kennington we shall find the Black Prince <QUOTE>at home,</QUOTE> and perhaps witness the execution of some of the Scottish rebels; at Dulwich and Camberwell we shall drop in and make the acquaintance of Edmund Alleyn, the <QUOTE>player</QUOTE> and friend of a certain <QUOTE>Will Shakespeare;</QUOTE> while a little nearer home, at Stockwell, we shall find a veritable <QUOTE>Ghost,</QUOTE> scarcely inferior to its rival of Cock Lane; at Clapham we shall find Mr. Wilberforce and the Evangelicals busy in founding the Bible Society; in St. George's Fields we shall spend a day with the inmates of New Bedlam, and try to cheer them   with our presence; and then mentally transport ourselves to the same spot in the days of Lord George Gordon and his riots, to witness their bonfires. We shall <QUOTE>assist</QUOTE> at the founding and opening of the Surrey and Victoria Theatres, and take our stand by the side of Mr. Astley when, supported by Ducrow, he <num value="1">first</num> encloses his riding-school. We shall peep in and hear a sermon from   Rowland Hill, in his well-known chapel in the Surrey Road; spend an evening in the Surrey Zoological Gardens; and then look in at Lambeth Palace, to witness the records of the <QUOTE>Lollard</QUOTE> prisoners, and make acquaintance with Archbishops   Chicheley, and Cranmer, and Parker, and Laud, Thence, having glanced in at the Museum of the Tradescants, we shall make our way to Faux or Vaux Hall, and take a view of the old place before it was turned into <QUOTE>Gardens.</QUOTE> Thence we shall walk on to Battersea, and shake hands with Lord Bolingbroke before he goes forth into exile, and reconnoitre sundry clusters of old houses, both in that village and in Wandsworth and Putney. There we shall try and arrange our visit so as to come in for the annual contest between Oxford and Cambridge for the blue riband of the London waters; then, crossing the river, we shall make a halt at Fulham in order to investigate at leisure the mansion which for so many centuries has been the residence of successive Bishops of London. Turning then back, in a north-westerly direction, it is our intention to make a perambulation of Hammersmith, so rich in literary and religious associations, and we shall conclude our wanderings with a brief visit to the grave of Hogarth, the painter and moralist, in Chiswick churchyard. 
    <P>It is just possible, indeed, that we may be led to go even a little further afield in search of subjects of interest, past and present; but if such should prove to be the case, we shall not forget that it is London and London life with which we have to deal, and that where London has extended its social life into the suburbs we must follow it up. At all events, we shall take good care not to leave any street or any house unexplored which can have an interest for the readers of <QUOTE>Old and New London.</QUOTE> 
    <P>With these few words of preface, we will commence our journey at the point where London  Bridge abuts on the east end of the <QUOTE>Ladye</QUOTE> Chapel of St. Saviour's. And here we cannot do better than repeat the words which we employed on <num value="1">first</num> starting from   Temple Bar:<NOTE>See Vol. I., p. <num value="9">9</num>.</NOTE>--<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Southwark, a Roman station and cemetery, is by no means without a history. It was burnt by William the Conqueror, and had been the scene of a battle against the Danes. It possessed palaces, monasteries, a mint, and fortifications. The Bishops of  Winchester and   Rochester once lived here in splendour, and the locality boasted its <num value="4">four</num> Elizabethan theatres. The  <Q> Globe</Q>  was Shakespeare's summer theatre, and here it was that his greatest triumphs were attained. What was acted there is best told by making Shakespeare's share in the management distinctly understood; nor can we leave Southwark without visiting the  <Q> Tabard</Q>  inn, from   whence   Chaucer's <num value="9">nine</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num> jovial pilgrims set out for Canterbury- 
            <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>The holye blissful martyr for to seek.</QUOTE></QUOTE>
 <pb id="P.3" n="3"> 
   <P>Hitherto, as our readers are aware, we have been concerned with those portions of our great metropolis which lie to the north of the Thames, and within the boundaries of the county of Middlesex; but the moment that we cross London Bridge we find ourselves in another county--that of Surreyso called from   South-rey-i.e., the south side of the river. 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.3.1">Southwark, Church, etc.</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>If we were to travel far into the interior of this county we should come upon scenes very unlike what we have seen in Middlesex; but the limits of our present pilgrimage will scarcely carry us so far afield as to the borders of the chalk formation which fringes the basin of clay and gravel which underlies the whole of London south, as well as London north, of the Thames. 
    <P>There was a time, some <num value="2000">two thousand</num> years ago, when the whole of the district now covered by Southwark and Lambeth, and most of the adjacent district, as far south as the rising grounds of Brixton, Streatham, and Clapham, was little more than a dull and dreary swamp, inhabited by the bittern and the frog, and when painted savages roamed and prowled about the places which are now not only busy thoroughfares, but the marts of foreign commerce.   But this change was the work of very many ages. 
    <P>In the early Saxon times there is no notice of any large town being situated here; but a tradition of Bartholomew Linsted, or Fowle, the last prior of  St. Mary Overie, as preserved to us by Stow in his <QUOTE>History of London,</QUOTE> tells us that the profits of the ferry--for before a bridge spanned the Thames a ferry had existed here--were devoted by the owner, <QUOTE>a maiden named Mary,</QUOTE> to the foundation and endowment of a convent or house of sisters, which was afterwards converted into a college of priests; and that these priests built a bridge of timber, which in the course of time was converted into a bridge of stone. 
    <P>Maitland, in his <QUOTE>History of London,</QUOTE> refuses to believe this tradition, which, if it be true, would carry back the date of the foundation of St. Mary  Overie's to a period far anterior to any historic notice of Southwark; but whether we accept it in its entirety or not, at all events the legend must be regarded as fair evidence of the early establishment of a religious house at this spot, and of the bestowal of the proceeds of the ferry for its support. 
    <P>The earliest mention of Southwark by name in history is in A.D. <datestruct value="1023"><year reg="1023">1023</year></datestruct>, when the Saxon chronicle tells us that Knut, and Egelnoth, Archbishop of  Canterbury, with some other distinguished persons, carried by ship the body of Alphege, saint and martyr, across the Thames to <QUOTE>Suthgeweorke,</QUOTE> on its way to its resting-place at Canterbury.   In <QUOTE>Domesday Book</QUOTE> the name appears under the form of <QUOTE>Sudwerche.</QUOTE> 
   <P>It is generally said that Southwark was never fortified till quite a recent period.   How, then, did its name, <QUOTE>wark</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>werke,</QUOTE> arise? Is it the same word as in bul<hi rend=italics>wark</hi>? A fortress built by the Earl of Mar, in Scotland, is called <QUOTE>Mar's wark or werke;</QUOTE> and possibly the same word is embodied in the word <QUOTE>Southwark.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Mr. Worsaae, in his <QUOTE>Account of the Danes and Norwegians in England,</QUOTE> refers to the possession by those peoples of Southwark, the very name of which, he adds, is unmistakably of Danish or Norwegian origin. <QUOTE>The Sagas relate that, in the time of King Svend Tveskjmeg, the Danes fortified this trading place, which, evidently, on account of its situation to the south of the Thames and London, was called Sydvirke (Sudvirke), or the southern fortification.   From   Sudvirke, which in Anglo- Saxon was called Sud-geweorc, but which in the Middle Ages obtained the name of Suthwerk or Swerk, arose the present form-Southwark. The Northmen had a church in Sudvirke, dedicated to the Norwegian king, Olaf the Saint.</QUOTE> It is stated that the name of Southwark has been spelled in no fewer than <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> different ways in old writings. 
    <P>We shall not attempt to invade too far the domain of learned antiquaries, and waste our readers' time and patience by a long disquisition on the question whether the natives of Southwark, <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> years ago--as a portion of the inhabitants of the county of Surrey--were descendants of the Regni or the Cantii, the Atrebates or the Bibroci. It is enough for us to know that the men of Surrey were among the tribes conquered by the legions of Julius Caesar, and that having belonged at <num value="1">one</num> time to the kingdom   of  Mercia, and at another to Kent, Surrey became after the Conquest part and parcel of the territory of the son-in-law of William, the powerful Earl of  Warrenne, and that, lying so near to the chief city of the kingdom, in spite of the <hi rend=italics>fluvius dissociabilis,</hi>
the Thames, it was gradually absorbed into the great metropolis, of which it became a suburb in the strictest sense, even before it was formally <QUOTE>annexed</QUOTE> to London. 
    <P>As already indicated, the low flat tongue of land bounded on <num value="3">three</num> sides by the Thames in the bend which it makes between Greenwich and  Vauxhall, was doubtless originally overflowed by the tide, and formed a large marsh extending to the foot of the slight eminences which bound its <num value="4">fourth</num> side upon the south. It is almost certain <pb id="P.4" n="4"> that this space was banked in artificially by the Romans, so as to secure it against being overflowed; and Roman remains, which have been dug up in St. George's Fields and elsewhere about Southwark and its neighbourhood, are sufficient proofs that the Romans formed there a settlement of some kind or other. Indeed, as Ptolemy tells us that London was in the territory of the Cantii, it has been inferred-though somewhat too hastily-that the original London stood on the south of the river; but this theory is generally rejected as being contrary to evidences of various kinds. It is far more probable that Ptolemy wrote with an imperfect knowledge of the geography of so distant and unimportant a place, and confounded the <num value="2">two</num> sides of a distant river. No doubt, however, from very early times there was on the south side a suburb consisting of dwelling-houses connected with the city by a ferry, where the great Roman road of the Watling crossed the Thames. 
   <P>The history of Southwark up to the period of the Norman Conquest is obscure and uncertain; but there is no doubt that the place was inhabited by the Romans, for Charles Knight tells us that <QUOTE>clear vestiges of Roman dwelling-houses have been found, not only in Southwark, but here and there along the bank of the river as far east as Deptford.</QUOTE> 
   <P>It has been asserted that there was no bridge between London and Southwark as early as the <num value="10">tenth</num> century, because we are told that in A.D. <datestruct value="993"><year reg="993">993</year></datestruct> Anlaf, the King of Norway, sailed up the river as far as Stane (Staines); but this inference is by no means to be accepted as certain, for we learn from William   of Malmesbury, and from   the <QUOTE>Saxon Chronicle,</QUOTE> that in the very next year there was a bridge here which obstructed the flight of Sweyn's forces, when he attacked London and was repulsed by its brave citizens.   Again, little more than <num value="20">twenty</num> years later, when Knut attacked London, there certainly was a bridge of <num value="1">one</num> kind or another, which formed an obstacle to the advance of his ships up the river; and in order to avoid this obstacle (according to the Saxon Chronicle), he dug on the south side a trench, through which he conveyed his vessels to a point <QUOTE>above bridge.</QUOTE> It is curious that in the accounts of these transactions which have come down to us there is no actual mention of Southwark by name; and yet there must have been some <QUOTE>werke</QUOTE> or defence, at all events, at the entrance of the bridge. Again, in <datestruct value="1052--"><year reg="1052">1052</year></datestruct>, Godwin, then in rebellion against Edward the Confessor, came with his fleet to Southwark, and passing the bridge without any opposition, proceeded to attack the king's vessels which lay off Westminster, though further hostilities were averted by an offer of peace. 
    <P>Perhaps it was the error of Sweyn in getting his fleet foul of London Bridge which made his son Knut go so laboriously to work with the waters of the Thames on his invasion in <datestruct value="1016--"><year reg="1016">1016</year></datestruct>, the story of which shall be briefly related in the words of the <QUOTE>Saxon Chronicle:</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>Then came the ships to Greenwiche, and, within a short interval, to London, where they sank a deep ditch on the south side, and so dragged their ships to the west side of the bridge. Afterwards they trenched the city without, so that no man could go in or out, and often fought against it; but the citizens bravely withstood them.</QUOTE> 
   <P>There have been several persons who have raised sceptical doubts about this history; but the honest historian, Maitland--who loved to get to the bottom of all such statements, and who set himself to discover proofs of Knut's trench-tells us that this artificial water-course began at the great wet-dock below Rotherhithe, and passing across the Kent Road, continued in a crescent form as far as Vauxhall, and fell again into the Thames at the lower end of Chelsea Reach. As proofs of the historic truth of this hypothesis, he brought forward the great quantities of hazels, willows, and brushwood, pointing northwards, and fastened down by rows of stakes, which were found at the digging and clearing out of Rotherhithe Dock in <datestruct value="1694--"><year reg="1694">1694</year></datestruct>, as well as numbers of large oaken planks and piles, found also in other parts on the Surrey side of the river. 
   <P>Southwark, very naturally, figures in the chapter of English history which immediately follows on the Battle of Hastings. As soon as he had won the battle, we read that William marched upon London, where the citizens had declared Edgar Atheling king of England.   On reaching Southwark, which then was an inconsiderable suburbthough not wholly unfortified, as may be gathered from   its name--the Conqueror was so roughly handled by the sturdy citizens of London, that though he repulsed them by the aid of some <num value="500">five hundred</num> horse, and laid the suburb in ashes, he found it necessary, or at all events prudent, to retire, and accordingly marched off in a westerly direction. 
   <P>Southwark is mentioned in history as far back as A.D. <datestruct value="1053"><year reg="1053">1053</year></datestruct>, and was a distinct corporation governed by its own bailiff until <datestruct value="1327--"><year reg="1327">1327</year></datestruct>, when Edward III. made a grant of it to the City of London, whose mayor was thenceforth to be its bailiff, and to govern it by his deputy. <QUOTE>Great inconvenience having been found to arise from its affording a refuge to offenders of various kinds,</QUOTE> the City was ordered to pay to the royal exchequer the sum of <pb id="P.5" n="5"> 
<!--illustration on unnumbered page facing page <num value="5">5</num>-->

<FIGURE id="Fig.005" n="2000.14.0003"><HEAD>London Bridge.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> annually as a fee-farm rent.   In this charter Southwark is called a <QUOTE>villa,</QUOTE> which may mean anything from a town down to a village; but if we take the term in the latter sense, it must have been a tolerably large <QUOTE>village,</QUOTE> for it had no less than <num value="4">four</num> churches: viz., St. Mary's (a chapel of the great conventual church of St. Mary over the Rie); St. Margaret's (where the Town Hall lately stood); St. Olave's; and, lastly, St. George's; to say nothing of the hospital of St. Thomas, <num value="2">two</num> prisons (namely, those of the King's Bench and the Marshalsea), and also the houses of several prelates, abbots, and nobles. 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.5.1">St. John's Church, Southwark</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>Some time after this, however, the inhabitants recovered their former privileges; but in the reign of Edward VI. the Crown granted the district to the City of London for a money grant of a little less than <measure value="650l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="650">650</num></measure>; in consideration of a further sum of <measure value="500bmark" type=currency><num value="500">500</num> marks</measure>, it was <QUOTE>annexed</QUOTE> to the said City, and by virtue of the same grant it continues subject to its Lord Mayor, who has under him a steward and a bailiff; and it is governed (or rather represented in the councils of the City) by <num value="1">one</num> of its aldermen, whose ward is styled by the name of <QUOTE>Bridgewithout.</QUOTE> The property granted to the City on the above occasion is regarded as specially liable to the repairs and maintenance of London Bridge. By this incorporation, however, Southwark did not cease to be part and parcel of the county of Surrey. From this arrangement certain lands were exempted, such as Southwark Mansion and Park, which belonged to the king. 
   <P>According to the <QUOTE>Penny Cyclopaedia</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>), this ward appears never to have been represented in the Common Council, nor do the inhabitants now elect their aldermen. The senior alderman of London is always alderman of this ward, and on his death the next in seniority succeeds him.   He has no ward duties to perform, so that his office is little else than a sinecure. The City of London appoints a high bailiff and steward for Southwark; but the county magistrates of Surrey exercise jurisdiction in several matters. 
   <P> <QUOTE>It is curious to observe,</QUOTE> says Mr. Robertson, in his <QUOTE>Lecture on Southwark,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>that London was <num value="1">first</num> indebted to Southwark for its bridge; that the <num value="1">first</num> bridge was built by the priests of the monastery in Southwark; that the Bridge-house was in Southwark, and not in London; that the revenues for the maintenance of the bridge were not derived from London, but from the southern, side of the Thames; and although land could not have been difficult to obtain close to the bridge, the expensive experiment was resorted to of building houses on the bridge-literally, on the Thames.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The earliest description of London Bridge, singularly enough, is given by an Icelander, who lived in the middle of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century, and may be found quoted by the Rev. James Johnstone, in his <QUOTE>Antiquitates Celto-Scandicae</QUOTE> (Copenhagen, <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">4</num>to), in connection with the Battle of Southwark, which was fought in Ioo<num value="8">8</num>, in the luckless reign of Ethelred II., surnamed the <QUOTE>Unready.</QUOTE> It runs as follows : 
   <P> <QUOTE>They   (i.e., the Danish forces) <num value="1">first</num> came to shore at London, where their ships were to remain, and the city was taken by the Danes.   Upon the other side of the river is situate a great market called Southwark-Sudurvirke in   the   originalwhich the Danes fortified with many defences; framing, for instance, a high and broad ditch, having a pile or rampart within it, formed of wood, stone, and turf, with a large garrison placed there to strengthen it.   This the king, Ethelred, . attacked and forcibly fought against; but by the resistance of the   Danes it proved but a vain endeavour.      There was at that time a bridge erected over the river between the City and Southwark, so wide that if <num value="2">two</num> carriages met they could pass each other.</QUOTE> This structure King Olave and his Norsemen destroyed by rowing their ships up close to the bridge, and making them fast to it by ropes and cables.   With these they strained the piles so vigorously, aided by the strong flow of the tide, that the piles gave way, and the whole bridge fell. <QUOTE>And now   it was determined to   attack Southwark,</QUOTE> continues the Icelander; <QUOTE>but the citizens seeing their river occupied by the enemy's navy so as to cut off all intercourse that way with the interior provinces, were seized with fear, and having surrendered the city, received Ethelred as king.</QUOTE> In remembrance of this expedition, thus sang Ottar Suarti, in a sort of rhythmic prose, which reminds <num value="1">one</num> of Macpherson's <title>Ossian</title>:-- 
   <QUOTE REND=blockquote><p>And thou hast overthrown their bridges, oh! thou storm of the sons of Odin! skilful and foremost in the battle. For thee it was happily reserved to possess the land of London's winding city. Many were the shields which were grasped, sword in hand, to the mighty increase of the conflict; but by thee were the iron-banded coats of mail broken and destroyed. 
   <p>Thou, then, hast come, defender of the land, and hast restored to his kingdom the exiled Ethelred. By thine aid is he advantaged, and made strong by thy valour and prowess; bitterest was that battle in which thou didst engage. Now, in the presence of thy kindred, the adjacent lands are at rest, where Edmund, the relative of the country and of the people, formerly governed. 
   <p>That was truly the <num value="6">sixth</num> fight which the mighty king fought with the men of England, wherein King Olaf, the chief himself, a son of Odin, valiantly attacked the bridge at London. Bravely did the swords of the Volsces defend it; but through the trench which the sea-kings, the men of <pb id="P.6" n="6"> Vikesland, guarded, they were enabled to come, and the plain of Southwark was full of his tents.</QUOTE>

   <P>The story of the destruction of London Bridge by Olaf is thus told in Southey's <QUOTE>Naval History of England,</QUOTE> with   all the details of historical narrative:-- <QUOTE>Among them   <hi rend=italics>(i.e</hi>. Ethelred and his forces) came a certain king   Olaf (perhaps the same who had been baptized in this country): he brought with him a strong fleet; and, with the aid of these Scandinavian ships, the King of England resolved upon attempting to re-take London from the Danes.   The fleet was of little use unless it could pass the bridge.   But this, which was of wood, wide enough for the commodious passage of <num value="2">two</num> carriages, and supported upon trestles, had been strongly fortified with towers, and a parapet breast high; and at its south end it was defended by a military work, placed on what the Icelandic historian calls the great emporium of Southwark. This fortress was of great strength, built of wood and stone, with a deep and wide ditch and ramparts of earth.   A <num value="1">first</num> attack upon the bridge failed; for the Danes had manned it well, and defended it bravely. Grieved at his repulse, Ethelred held a council of war, to deliberate in what manner 
<FIGURE id="Fig.006" n="2000.14.0004"><HEAD>South End Of Old London Bridge, With Shot Tower And St. Olave's Church, In <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 they might hope to destroy the bridge; and Olaf undertook to make the attempt with some of his ships, if the other leaders would join in the assault. Causing, therefore, some deserted houses to be pulled down, he employed the beams and planks in constructing projections from the sides of the ships, under cover of which, when they were laid alongside the bridge, the assault might be made: a contrivance intended to serve the same purpose as those machines which, under the names of 
<Q>cats</Q> and  <Q>sows,</Q> were used   in   sieges.   He expected that the roofing would be strong enough to resist the weight of any stones which might be thrown upon it; but in this expectation he had calculated too much upon the solidity of his materials, and too little upon the exertions and activity of the defenders; and when, with the advantage of the flowing tide, the ships had taken their station, stones of such magnitude were let fall upon them, that the cover was beaten in; shields and helmets afforded no protection; the ships themselves were shaken and greatly injured, and many of them   sheered off.   Olaf, however, persisted in his enterprise.   Under cover of such a bulwark, he succeeded in fastening some strong <pb id="P.7" n="7">

 <pb id="P.8" n="8"> cables or chains to the trestles which supported the bridge: and, when the tide had turned, his rowers, aided by the returning stream, tore away the middle of it, many of the enemy being precipitated into the river.

   <P>Such, according to ancient story, were the martial feats of King Olaf, or Olave, upon the water; but for his more pious and peaceful actions on land, which caused the men of Southwark to venerate his memory, it is needful only to turn to the church which bears his name, at the south-eastern corner of the bridge, and of which we shall speak presently.

<ITEM>Building of New London Bridge</ITEM>

</LIST>
 
<P>Stow, in his <QUOTE>Survey of London,</QUOTE> advances as highly probable the hypothesis that when the <num value="1">first</num> stone bridge was erected over the Thames the course of the river was temporarily changed, being diverted into a new channel, <QUOTE>a trench being cut for that purpose, beginning, as it is supposed, east, about Rotherhithe, and ending in the west, about Patricksey, now Battersea.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Strype, too, seems to support this view, when he writes: <QUOTE>It is much controverted whether the river Thames was turned when the bridge over it was built. .... But from all that hath been seen and written upon the turning of the river, it seems very evident to me that it <hi rend=italics>was</hi> turned whilst the bridge was building.</QUOTE> But Sir Christopher Wren, and after him Maitland, are of the contrary opinion, and think that Stow confused the ditch of the <num value="10">tenth</num> century with that dug in the time of Knut. 
   <P>Old London Bridge was said to have been <QUOTE>built on woolpacks :</QUOTE> this, however, is, of course, a play upon words, for, in reality, it was built largely out of the produce of a tax on wool.   Stow also states that the bridge-gate at the Southwark end was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="4">four</num> chief gates of the City of London, and that it stood there long before the Norman Conquest, when the bridge was only of timber.   But this supposition again is strongly denied by Maitland. 
   <P>Of London Bridge itself, and many of the historical scenes that were enacted upon it, we have already spoken in a previous part of this work;<NOTE>See Vol. II., pp. <num value="9">9</num>-<num value="17">17</num>.</NOTE>
but Southwark has played too important a part on several occasions, in scenes connected with the bridge, to be altogether lost sight of here. Indeed, the bridge-foot must have seen very fine and gay sights in the old days before the Reformation, in the shape of religious and royal processions. For instance, in <datestruct value="1392--"><year reg="1392">1392</year></datestruct>, when Richard II. suspended and seized on the Charter of the City of London, and the citizens offered to re-purchase their rights for a sum of money, the king was graciously pleased to travel up to London from Windsor, <QUOTE>to re-assure <pb id="P.9" n="9"> them   of his favour.</QUOTE> The ceremony of publicly receiving their Majesties, we are told, began at Wandsworth, <QUOTE>with great splendour and a considerable train,</QUOTE> when <num value="400">four hundred</num> of the citizens of London, well mounted, and habited in livery of <num value="1">one</num> colour, rode forth to meet the king. <QUOTE>At St. George's Church, in Southwark,</QUOTE> says Thomas of Walsingham, <QUOTE>the procession was met by Robert Braybrooke, Bishop of London, and his clergy, followed by <num value="500">five hundred</num> boys in surplices..  . When the train arrived at the gate of London Bridge, nearly the whole of the inhabitants, arranged in order according to their rank, age, and sex, advanced to receive it, and presented the king with a fair milk-white steed, harnessed and caparisoned in cloth of gold, brocaded in red and white, and hung about with silver bells; whilst to the queen (Anne of Bohemia) they presented a palfrey, also white, and caparisoned in like manner in white and red.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1212--"><year reg="1212">1212</year></datestruct>, the Priory of Southwark, and other parts adjoining the south end, were destroyed by fire, along with the greater part of the bridge itself, which was then of wood.   The flames having caught the beams of the bridge, many of the Londoners lost their lives by fire, and others by water, being drowned in attempting to escape. 
    <P>In the reign of Henry III. (A.D. <datestruct value="1307"><year reg="1307">1307</year></datestruct>), Southwark was the scene of a conflict between the forces of the king and those of Simon de Montfort, the sturdy Earl of Leicester, which were marched, we are told, through the county of Surrey, and being victorious near the foot of the bridge, forced the king to beat a retreat, while <LEMMA id="lemma.9.1">De Montfort</LEMMA> passed in triumph over the bridge into the City: the citizens of London being, nearly to a man, upon his side. 
    <P>Splendid   pageants were, doubtless, seen frequently here whilst the Court lived at the Tower, and when London Bridge was the only way from the south of England into the City. Of some of these we have already spoken in the chapter above referred to, particularly of those in the reign of  Richard II., which was, indeed, a memorable reign for London Bridge. 
     <P>King Henry V. was received here in great state on his return to London after the victory of Agincourt; an event which was celebrated in verse by   John Lydgate or Lidgate, the monk of Bury:-- 
       <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=couplet><L>To London Brygge then rode our kyng,

            <L><foreign lang=la>Gloria tibi, Trinitas!</foreign></QUOTE>

   <P>Fabyan tells us, in his <QUOTE>Chronicles,</QUOTE> that in <datestruct value="1437--"><year reg="1437">1437</year></datestruct>, on Monday, the <datestruct VALUE="-01-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, the great stone gate and the tower standing upon it, next Southwark, <QUOTE>fell suddenly down at the river, with <num value="2">two</num> of the fairest arches of the said bridge.</QUOTE> To which   Stow   piously adds, <QUOTE>And yet no   man perished in   body, which was a great work of Almighty God.</QUOTE> 
   <P>It appears from the narratives which have come down to us concerning the insurrections of Wat Tyler, Jack Cade, and Falconbridge, that in the Middle Ages Southwark was still somewhat destitute of fortifications; and, probably, its <num value="1">first</num> regular defences were those of the circuit of fortifications thrown up by order of the Parliament during the civil war. 
   <P>Jack Cade seems to have made Southwark his head-quarters all through his rebellion. In Shakespeare's vivid scenes of this rebellion (<title>Henry Vl, Part II</title>), a messenger tells the king:-- 
    <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Jack Cade hath gotten London Bridge; the citizens 
       <L>Fly and forsake their houses, &amp;c.</QUOTE>

    <P>Jack Cade, after his skirmish on Blackheath, took up his quarters at the <QUOTE>Hart Inn,</QUOTE> both before and after his entry into the City. On the night of Sunday, <datestruct VALUE="1450-07-5"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=5>5th</day>, <year reg=1450>1450</year></datestruct>, Cade being then in Southwark, the city captains, the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of London, mounted guard upon the bridge. <QUOTE>The rebelles,</QUOTE> says Hall, in his <QUOTE>Chronicle,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>which neuer soundly slepte, for feare of sodayne chaunces, hearing the bridge to be kept and manned, ran with great haste to open the passage, where betwene bothe partes was a ferce and cruell encounter.   Matthew Gough, more expert in marciall feates than the other cheuetaynes of the citie, perceiuing the Kentish men better to stand   to their tacklyng   than   his ymagination expected, aduised his company no farther to procede toward Southwarke till the day appered; to the entent that the citizens hearing where the place of the ieopardye rested, might seccurre their enemies and releue their frendes and companions.  But this counsail came to smal effect: for the multitude of the rebelles drave the citizens from the stulpes [wooden piles] at the bridge-foote, to the drawe-bridge, and began to set fyre in diuers houses. Alas! what sorow it was to beholde that miserable chaunce: for some desyringe to eschew the fyre lept on hys enemies weapon, and so died; fearfull women, with chyldren in their armes, amased and appalled, lept into the riuer; other, doubtinge how to saue them   self betwene fyre, water, and swourd, were in their houses suffocate and <pb id="P.10" n="10"> smoldered; yet the captayns nothyng regarding these chaunces, fought on this drawe-bridge all the nyghte valeauntly, but in conclusion the rebelles gat the drawe-bridge, and drowned many, and slew John Sutton, alderman, and Robert Heysande, a hardy citizen, with many other, besyde Matthew Gough, a man of greate wit, much experience in feates of chiualrie, the which in continuall warres had valeauntly serued the king, and his father, in the partes beyond the sea. But it is often sene, that he which many tymes hath vanquyshed his enemies in straunge countreys, and returned agayn as a conqueror, hath of his owne nation afterward been shamfully murdered and brought to confusion. This hard and sore conflict endured on the bridge till ix of the clocke in the mornynge in doubtfull chaunce and fortune's balaunce: for some tyme the Londoners were bet back to the stulpes at Sainct Magnus Corner; and sodaynly agayne the rebelles were repulsed and dryuen back to the stulpes in Southwarke; so that both partes beyng faynte, wery, and fatygate, agreed to desist from fight, and to leue battayll till the next day, vpon condition that neyther Londoners should passe into   Southwarke, nor the   Kentish   men into London.</QUOTE> 
    <P>During the truce that followed this defence of  London Bridge, a general pardon was procured for  Cade and his followers by the Lord High Chancellor, Archbishop   Stafford; and all began to withdraw   by degrees from   Southwark with their spoil. Cade, however, was soon afterwards slain, and his dead body having been brought up to  London, his head was placed over the south gate of London Bridge. Mr. Mark A. Lower has been at the trouble of recording the fact that he was slain, not at Hothfield, in Kent, but at Heathfield, near Cuckfield, in Sussex, where a roadside monument is erected in his honour. It bears the following inscription:-- 
         <QUOTE REND=center><CIT><QUOTE><p>Near this spot was slain the notorious rebel, 
                           <p><emph rend=caps><name>Jack Cade</name></emph>,

    <p>His body was carried to London, and his head fixed on  London Bridge. 
    <p>This is the success of all rebels, and this fortune chanceth ever to traitors.</QUOTE><BIBL>--Hall's Chronicle.</BIBL></CIT></QUOTE>

    <P>By that awful gate which looked towards Southwark, for a period of nearly <num value="300">three hundred</num> years, under Tudor and Stuart sovereigns, it must have been a rare thing for the passenger to walk without seeing <num value="1">one</num> or more human heads stuck upon a pike, looking down upon the flow of the river below, and rotting and blackening in the sun. The head of the noble Sir William Wallace was for many months exposed on this spot.   In <datestruct value="1471--"><year reg="1471">1471</year></datestruct> Falconbridge- <QUOTE>the bastard Falconbridge</QUOTE> --made South. wark his head-quarters in his impudent attack on London.   He arrived here in May, giving out that he came to free King Henry from   his captivity; and by way of proof of his intention, burnt part of the bridge, together with some of the houses in the suburbs of Southwark. After meeting with defeat, his head and those of <num value="9">nine</num> of his comrades were stuck together on <num value="10">ten</num> spears, where they remained visible to all comers, till the elements and the carrion crows had left nothing of them there but the bones. At a later period the head of the pious Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, was stuck up here, along with that of the honest and philosophic Sir Thomas More.   The quarters of Sir Thomas Wyatt, the son of the well-known poet of that name, were exhibited here, at the end of the bridge, during the reign of Queen Mary. 
    <P><num value="1">One</num> of the most imposing pageants witnessed at  London Bridge was that accorded here by the citizens to <LEMMA id="lemma.10.1">Henry VI.</LEMMA>, on his return to London, after having been crowned King of France in the church of Notre Dame at Paris; the <QUOTE>pageant</QUOTE> consisting, if Fabyan may be trusted, of a <QUOTE>mighty gyaunt standyng, with a swoard drawen,</QUOTE> and figures of <num value="3">three</num> <QUOTE>emperesses,</QUOTE> representing Nature,  Grace, and Fortune; with <num value="7">seven</num> maidens, all in white, representing the <num value="7">seven</num> orders of the angelic host, who addressed the king in verses recorded at full length by Lydgate, of which the following stanza may serve as a sample:-- 
      <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>God the (thee) endue with a crowne of glorie, 
        <L>And with a sceptre of clennesse and pit&eacute;, 
        <L>And with a shield of right and victorie, 
        <L>And with a mantel of prudence clad thou be: 
        <L>A shelde of faith for to defende the, 
        <L>An helme of hettle wrought to thine encres 
        <L>Girt with a girdel of loue and perfect peese (peace).</QUOTE>

    <P>Henry VII. was received here in pomp, after defeating the insurgents, in <datestruct value="1497--"><year reg="1497">1497</year></datestruct>; the heads of the leaders of the outbreak, Flamoke and Joseph, being set over the entrance to the bridge. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1501--"><year reg="1501">1501</year></datestruct> , Prince Arthur, eldest son of Henry VII., with his bride, Katharine of Aragon, was welcomed here on his way from <QUOTE>Lambhithe</QUOTE> to witness the rejoicings prepared for them in the City. Stow tells us, in his <QUOTE>Annals,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>that at the entrance of London Bridge they were greeted by a costly pageant of St. Katharine and St. Ursula, with many virgins.</QUOTE> How little did she then think of the fate that awaited her! 
    <P>Cardinal Wolsey rode in great state over the bridge, and through the High Street, Southwark, and along the Kentish Road, when he left the <pb id="P.11" n="11"> kingdom in <datestruct value="1526--"><year reg="1526">1526</year></datestruct>, for the purpose of arranging a marriage between Henry VIII. and the Duchess d&lsquo;Alencon.   <num value="2">Two</num> years later, the public entry of Cardinal Campeggio, as legate from the Pope, into London, to deal with the question of Henry's divorce from Queen Katharine, must have been a brave sight.   The nobility rode in advance from Blackheath towards London Bridge, <QUOTE>well mounted, and wearing elegant attire;</QUOTE> then came the cardinal himself, in magnificent robes, <QUOTE>glittering with jewels and precious stones;</QUOTE> then his <QUOTE>cross-bearers, the carriers of his pole-axes, his servants in red livery, his secretaries, physicians, and general suite.</QUOTE> Next came <num value="200">two hundred</num> horsemen and a <QUOTE>vast concourse of people.</QUOTE> The procession is said to have grown to <num value="2">two</num> miles in length before it reached the City gates. From St. George's Church to the foot of the bridge the road was lined on both sides by the monks and the other clergy, dressed in their various habits, with copes of cloth of gold, silver and gold crosses, and banners, who, we are told, as the legate passed, <QUOTE>threw   up clouds of incense and sang hymns.</QUOTE> At the foot of the bridge <num value="2">two</num> bishops received the cardinal, the people shouted for joy, whilst all the bells of the City were rung, and the roar of artillery from the Tower and the river-forts <QUOTE>rent the air</QUOTE> --to use Wolsey's own words- <QUOTE>as if the very heavens would fall.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In the insurrection of Sir Thomas Wyatt in <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>-<num value="4">4</num>,<NOTE>See Vol. III., p, <num value="125">125</num>, and Vol. IV., p. <num value="289">289</num>.</NOTE> Southwark formed the rallying-point for that misguided rebel and his force, some <num value="4000">four thousand</num> strong. His soldiers, meeting with but little opposition on the south of the Thames, attacked and sacked the palace of the Bishop of  Winchester, whose fine library they destroyed. As the artillery in the Tower began to fire on Southwark next day, in order to dislodge Sir Thomas, the inhabitants urged him to retreat, in order to save them from loss and destruction. His subsequent movements and his ultimate fate we have already recorded. 
   <P>Stow tells us, in his <QUOTE>Survey</QUOTE> (vol. i., p. <num value="64">64</num>), that in <datestruct VALUE="1577-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1577">1577</year></datestruct>, the tower at the northern end having become decayed, a new <num value="1">one</num> was commenced in its place; and that during the interval the heads of the traitors which had formerly stood upon it were set upon the tower over the gate at Bridgefoot, Southwark, which consequently came to be called the Traitors' Gate. It may be remembered that John Houghton, the Prior of the Charterhouse, Sir Thomas More, and Bishop Fisher, were among the <QUOTE>traitors</QUOTE> who were thus treated. 
   <P>About the time when these heads were removed, several alterations and improvements would seem to have been made in the bridge, especially in the erection of a <QUOTE>beautiful and chargeable piece of wood</QUOTE> --<hi rend=italics>i.e</hi>., a magnificent wood mansion, which formed a <num value="2">second</num> Southwark Gate and Tower. 
   <P>It is worthy of note that after the defeat of the Spanish Armada, <num value="11">eleven</num> of the captured standards were hung upon London Bridge at the end looking towards Southwark, on the day of Southwark Fair, <QUOTE>to the great joy of all the people who repaired thither.</QUOTE> 
   <P>When the Parliamentary cause was in the ascendant, and King Charles was expected to attack the City, Southwark was rapidly   fortified, particularly about the foot of London Bridge, like the other outlying portions of the metropolis ;<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="335">335</num>.</NOTE> and <num value="1">one</num> of Cromwell's officers, Colonel Rainsborough, with a brigade of horse and foot, was able to hold the whole borough of Southwark almost without opposition. 
   <P>On Tuesday, the <datestruct VALUE="1660-05-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, King Charles II. entered London   in   triumph, after having   been   magnificently   entertained   in   St. George's Fields. About <num value="3">three</num> in the afternoon he arrived in Southwark, and thence proceeded over the bridge into the City, attended by all the glory of London and the military forces of the kingdom. Lord Clarendon, who makes this <QUOTE>fair return of banished majesty</QUOTE> the concluding scene of his noble <QUOTE>History of the Great Rebellion,</QUOTE> gives us but little information as to the details of the king's reception at London Bridge, though we learn incidentally from his pages that <QUOTE>the crowd was very great.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Bloome, <num value="1">one</num> of the continuators of Stow, expressly says that in the Great Fire some of the old houses at the south end of the bridge-several of them built in the reign of King John-escaped the flames. 
   <P><num value="2">Two</num> Gothic towers--not uniform in plan, however-defended the southern end of the original bridge, and also of the <num value="2">second</num>.   At this end of the bridge were, likewise, <num value="4">four</num> corn-mills, based on <num value="3">three</num> sterlings, which projected far into the river westward.   They were covered with a long shed, formed of shingles or thin boards, and could certainly have been no ornament to the structure to which they were an appendage. We have already spoken of the houses and shops--which lined the roadway of old London Bridge,<NOTE>See Vol. II., p. <num value="15">15</num>.</NOTE> but we may here make mention of the tradesmen's tokens which were once in use here.   A full list of those used in <pb id="P.12" n="12"> Southwark will be found in the appendix to Manning and Bray's <QUOTE>History of Surrey.</QUOTE> Several of these tokens relate to London Bridge. The author of <QUOTE>Chronicles of London Bridge</QUOTE> gives illustrations of several, among which is a copper token, farthing size, having on the <num value="1">one</num> side, to speak heraldically, a bear passant, chained; and on the reverse, the words <QUOTE>Abraham Browne, at ye Bridgefoot, Southwark; his half penny.</QUOTE> Another copper token shows the same device, with the legend <QUOTE>Cornelius Cook, at the  <Q>Beare</Q>  at the Bridgefoot.</QUOTE> Another displays a sugar-loaf, with the name, <QUOTE>Henry Phillips, at the Bridj-foot, Southwark.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The end of London Bridge, on the Southwark side, was known as Bridge-foot. The <QUOTE>Bear</QUOTE> here was, for some centuries, <num value="1">one</num> of the most popular of London taverns; indeed, if we may accept Mr. Larwood's statement, it was the resort of aristocratic pleasure-seekers as early as the reign of Richard III. Thus, in <datestruct VALUE="1463-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1463">1463</year></datestruct>-<num value="4">4</num>, it was repeatedly visited by the <QUOTE>Jockey of Norfolk,</QUOTE> then Sir John Howard, who went thither to drink wine and shoot at the target.

   <P>This old tavern was taken down in <datestruct VALUE="1761-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>, when a quantity of coins, dating as far back as the reign of Elizabeth, were found, as may be seen by a reference to the <hi rend=italics>Public Advertiser</hi> of that date. 
   <P>We learn from   the kIarleian manuscripts that <pb id="P.13" n="13"> there was here another old inn, known as the <QUOTE>Knave of Clubs,</QUOTE> kept by <num value="1">one</num> Edward Butling, whose advertisement states that he <QUOTE>maketh and selleth all sorts of hangings for rooms, &amp;c.,</QUOTE> and who, probably, also sold playing-cards, if his sign had any meaning. 
   <P>Bridge Street, probably, extended itself gradually on to the bridge itself; the houses being distinguished by signs, some of which have come down to our times, in the works of antiquaries and on tradesmen's tokens and bill-heads. For instance: there is extant a small copper-plate tobacco paper, probably of the reign of Queen Anne, with a coarse and rude engraving of a negro smoking, and holding in his hand a roll of tobacco; above his head is a crown, <num value="2">two</num> ships in full sail are behind, and the sun issues from the right-hand corner above; in the foreground are <num value="4">four</num> little negroes planting and packing tobacco, and beneath is the name <QUOTE>John Winkley, Tobacconist, near ye Bridge, in the Burrough, Southwark.</QUOTE> We have also seen another shop bill, of about the same date, displaying, within a rich cartouche frame, a pair of embroidered small-clothes and a glove: beneath is the legend, <QUOTE>Walter Watkins, Breeches-maker, Leather-seller, and Glover, at the sign of the  <Q> Breeches and Glove,</Q>

   <P>In the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century,.the street on the bridge ranked with St. Paul's Churchyard, Paternoster Row, and Little Britain, as <num value="1">one</num> of the principal literary emporia of the City. <QUOTE>The <num value="3">Three</num> Bibles,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Angel,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>The Looking-Glass,</QUOTE> are some of the signs of the publishers established <QUOTE>on London Bridge,</QUOTE> and mentioned on the title-pages of books published at this date. 
   <P>John Bunyan at <num value="1">one</num> time certainly used to preach in a chapel in Southwark; but, in all probability, the author of <QUOTE>Wine and Walnuts</QUOTE> is using the vagueness of after-dinner talkers when he says that the converted tinker lived on London Bridge. Perhaps he was led into the error by the fact that <num value="1">one</num> of Bunyan's lesser books was published there. 
   <P>The Bridge House and Yard in <LEMMA id="lemma.13.2">Tooley Street</LEMMA>
are closely connected with the history of the bridge itself. For Stow tells us, in his <QUOTE>Survey</QUOTE> (vol. ii., p. <num value="24">24</num>), that they were so called as being <pb id="P.14" n="14"> <QUOTE>a store-house for stone, timber, or whatsoever pertaineth to the building or repairing of London Bridge.</QUOTE> He adds that this Bridge House <QUOTE>seemeth to have taken beginning with the <num value="1">first</num> foundation of the bridge, either of stone or timber;</QUOTE> and that it covers <QUOTE>a large plot of ground on the banks of the river Thames, containing divers large buildings for the stowage of materials</QUOTE> for the bridge. The Bridge House, in fact, was long used as a receptacle of provisions for the navy, and as a store-house for the public in times of dearth; ovens were attached to it, in which the biscuit for the Royal Navy was baked. It was also used on certain occasions as a banqueting-hall, when the Lord Mayor came in his official capacity to the borough. <num value="1">One</num> of these occasions was at the opening of <LEMMA id="lemma.14.1">Southwark Fair</LEMMA>, of which we shall have more to say presently. We may state here, however, that the fair was instituted in the reign of Edward VI., and was held annually in the month of September. <QUOTE>At the time of this fair, anciently called  <Q> Our Lady's Fair in Southwark,</Q> </QUOTE> observes the author of <QUOTE>Chronicles of London Bridge,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs used to ride to St. Magnus' Church after dinner, at <num value="2">two</num> o'clock in the afternoon, the former being vested with his collar of SS., without his hood, and all dressed in the scarlet gowns, lined, without their cloaks. They were attended by the swordbearer, wearing his embroidered cap, and carrying the  <Q>pearl</Q>  sword; and at church were met by the aldermen, all of whom, after evening prayer, rode over the bridge in procession, and passed through the fair, and continued either to St. George's Church, Newington Bridge, or the stones pointing out the City Liberties at St. Thomas of Waterings. They then returned over the bridge, or to the Bridge House, where a banquet was provided, and the aldermen took leave of the Lord Mayor; all parties being returned home, the Bridge Masters gave a supper to the Lord Mayor's officers.</QUOTE> 
    <P> <QUOTE>The <num value="2">two</num> governors of the bridge,</QUOTE> writes the author of the work above quoted, <QUOTE>have an excellent house in the suburb of Southwark, as well as a store-house, containing everything belonging to their occupation.</QUOTE> From   the same work we learn that a cross, charged with a small saltire, is supposed to have been the old heraldic device for Southwark or the estate of London Bridge; and we know that the arms used for those places are still Azure, an amulet, ensigned with a cross patee, Or, interlaced with a saltire, conjoined in base of the <num value="2">second</num>. 
   <P>The following just remarks on the general aspect of Southwark in the Middle Ages are taken from Dr. R. Paule's <QUOTE>Pictures of Old London:</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>On the other side of the river lay many points, isolated and unconnected with <num value="1">one</num> another, which are now joined together into a district of the town that numbers its hundreds of thousands of inhabitants. It was only at the outlet of the bridge at Southwark that, from different causes, there had arisen in ancient times a town-like settlement. <num value="2">Two</num> great priories--the monastery of St. Mary Overies and the convent of Bermondsey-had early given rise to the active and busy intercommunication which naturally resulted from the vicinity of such ecclesiastical institutions as these were. Near to St. Mary's, and not far from the bridge, there stood till the time of the Reformation the magnificent 
<LEMMA id="lemma.14.2">palace of the Bishop of Winchester</LEMMA>, <num value="1">one</num> of the wealthiest and most powerful prelates in the land, and whose extensive spiritual jurisdiction included the county of Surrey. The most important agent in this great intercommunication was the high road which ran from the bridge, and extended through the southern counties to the ports of Kent, Sussex, and Hampshire.   Here heavily-laden wagons were constantly moving to and fro; and here, too, assembled, at the appointed seasons of the year, the motley crowd of pilgrims who were bound for the shrine of the holy Thomas a Becket at Canterbury. The  <Q>Tabard</Q>  inn had been known far and near for many ages, from the vivid descriptions given by Chaucer of the busy life and stir which blended there with devotion and adventure. All remains of it are not yet (<datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>) effaced, although there has been erected in its immediate neighbourhood the railway terminus of that great overland route which connects England with India.        .. The greater part of the land lying on the opposite 
<hi rend=italics>(i.e</hi>., the Surrey) bank of the river consisted of fields and gardens, with a few larger hamlets, and some places of amusement, where bear-baiting and cock-fighting were practised. Immediately opposite to Westminster rose the chapel and castellated towers and walls of the princely residence which the Archbishops of Canterbury had chosen before the close of the <num value="12">twelfth</num> century for their town residence, in the immediate neighbourhood of the chief offices of state and the tribunals of justice.</QUOTE> Such must have been, speaking   generally, the appearance of Southwark <num value="5">five</num> centuries ago. 
   <P>In the time of Elizabeth, if we may rely on the statements of the <QUOTE>Penny Cyclopsedia,</QUOTE> Southwark appears to have consisted of a line of street extending from the bridge nearly to where now is the Borough Road, formerly called <QUOTE>Long Southwark;</QUOTE> Kent Street, then the high road to Canterbury and Dover, and of which only the part near St. George's Church was lined with houses   a line of street, <pb id="P.15" n="15"> including Tooley or St. Olave's Street, extending from the <QUOTE>Bridge-foot</QUOTE> to Rotherhithe Church; another line of street running westward by Bankside to where is now the Blackfriars Road; and, lastly, Bermondsey   Street, branching   off from Tooley Street to Bermondsey Church.   Excepting near St. Saviour's Church, there were at that time scarcely any back or cross streets. Near Bankside were the Bishop of Winchester's palace, the Globe Theatre, the <QUOTE>Stews,</QUOTE> and <num value="2">two</num> <QUOTE>Bear Gardens</QUOTE> for baiting bulls and bears. The <QUOTE>villages</QUOTE> of Lambeth, Kennington, Newington, and Walworth were then separated from   Southwark, and from   each other also, by open fields. 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.15.1">Opening of New London Bridge</LEMMA></NOTE>

    <P>Towards the end of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century Southwark had extended itself considerably. The houses on the east side of Blackman Street now stretched to Newington and Walworth, which thus became joined on to the metropolis, though St. George's Fields, on the western side, still remained open country.   Back streets, also, and alleys had been formed on either side of High Street, as far as St. George's Church. In the early part of the eighteenth century the buildings of Southwark extended along the river-side as far as Lambeth; and in the opposite direction Rotherhithe Street was continued to and even   beyond   Cuckold's Point, where the river bends to the southward. Later still, in the middle of the eighteenth century, the opening of Blackfriars Bridge led to the formation of Great Surrey Street; and towards the close of the century, St;. George's Fields were enclosed and laid out in new streets. Since the commencement of the present century, Lambeth Marsh--which formerly separated Southwark from Lambeth--has been covered with new streets and buildings; and in every direction Southwark has spread itself till it has united itself with all the surrounding villages, from Greenwich in the far east to Battersea in the far west, and combined them into <num value="1">one</num> large town, having a population of about <num value="300000">300,000</num>, of which Southwark proper may be regarded as the nucleus. 
   <P>In a little less than <num value="10">ten</num> years after the Great Fire of London-namely, in <datestruct VALUE="1676-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>-Southwark was visited by a fire which did, in proportion, almost equal damage with the conflagration which has become historical. <QUOTE>It broke out,</QUOTE> writes Mr. C. Walford, in the <QUOTE>Insurance Cyclopaedia,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>at an oilman's, between the  <Q>George</Q>  and    <Q><LEMMA id="lemma.15.2">Tabard</LEMMA></Q>  inns, opposite St. Margaret's Hill. The front of the  <Q>Tabard</Q>  was consumed, but was immediately rebuilt, presumably in <hi rend=italics>fac-simile</hi> of the original, with its court-yard, galleries, pilgrim's hall, and quaint old sleeping-rooms.   It is doubtful,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>how far any part of the hotel then burnt may have been part of the actual inn described by 
<LEMMA id="lemma.15.3">Chaucer</LEMMA>: where, on the eve of a pilgrimage, the pretty prioress, the  <Q>Wife of Bath,</Q>  the  <Q>Knight,</Q>  the  <Q> Squire,</Q>  the  <Q> Sumpnour,</Q>  and the  <Q> Pardoner,</Q>  met, chatted, laughed, and flirted.   The  <Q>White Hart,</Q>  whose name was connected with that of Jack Cade, was also burnt in this fire. The fireengines were <num value="1">first</num> worked with hose-pipes on this occasion, and did good service. It was probably owing to these that the conflagration was stayed at St. Thomas's Hospital.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The king (Charles II.) was so much touched by the sight, which recalled vividly the scenes which he had witnessed <num value="10">ten</num> years before, that he went down the river in his state-barge to London Bridge, in order <QUOTE>to give such orders as His Majesty found fit for putting a stop to it.</QUOTE> It is difficult, however, to see how a king could be of more use in such an emergency than a good chief-fireman, or even of as much service. The buildings being as yet, like those of Old London, chiefly of timber, lath, and plaster, the fire spread extensively; and its further progress was only stayed <QUOTE>after that about <num value="600">600</num> houses had been burnt or blown up.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Old London Bridge, and the street winding southward from it, were situated about a <num value="100">hundred</num> feet eastward of the present bridge and its approach from   the High Street.   The building of New  London Bridge was actually commenced on the  <datestruct VALUE="1824-05-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, whenthe <num value="1">first</num> coffer-dam for the southern pier was driven into the bed of the river; the <num value="1">first</num> stone was laid in <datestruct VALUE="1825-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>; and the bridge was publicly opened by William IV. and  Queen Adelaide on the Ist of <datestruct VALUE="1831-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>. <QUOTE>I was present, a few days ago,</QUOTE> writes Lucy Aikin, in  September of that year, <QUOTE>at the splendid spectacle of the opening of new London Bridge.   It was covered half-way over with a grand canopy, formed of the flags of all nations, near which His Majesty dined with about <num value="2000">two thousand</num> of his loyal subjects.  The river was thronged with gilded barges and boats, covered with streamers, and crowded with gaily-dressed people; the shores were alive with the multitude.   In the midst of ths gay show I looked down the stream upon the old, deserted, halfdemolished   bridge, the silent remembrancer of <num value="7">seven</num> centuries. I thought of it fortified, with a lofty gate at either end, and encumbered with a row of houses on each side. I beheld it the scene of tournaments; I saw its barrier closed against the rebel Wyatt; and I wished myself a poet for its sake.</QUOTE> <pb id="P.16" n="16">

 <P>Before proceeding with an examination of the various objects of antiquarian interest abounding in the locality, it may be as well to state that  Southwark is a general name, sometimes taken and understood as including, and sometimes as excluding Rotherhithe, Bermondsey, and Lambeth. We shall use it, at present, in the latter sense. 
    <P>Black's <QUOTE>Guide to London,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct>, divides the district south of the Thames into <num value="2">two</num> principal portions :-- <QUOTE><num value="1">1</num>. Southwark, known also as  <Q>the Borough,</Q>  including   Bermondsey and  Rotherhithe, with a population of about <num value="194000">194,000</num>.  <num value="2">2</num>. Lambeth, with the adjacent but outlying districts of Kennington, Walworth, Newington, Wandsworth, and   Camberwell, with a population   of  <num value="386000">386,000</num>.</QUOTE> Southwark   is   always called <QUOTE>the  Borough</QUOTE> by Londoners; and very naturally so, for it has been a <QUOTE>borough</QUOTE> literally, having returned <num value="2">two</num> members to   Parliament since the <num value="23">twenty-third</num> year of Edward I., and it was for several centuries the only <QUOTE>borough</QUOTE> adjacent to the <QUOTE>cities</QUOTE> of London and Westminster. Under the <num value="1">first</num> Reform Bill (<datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>) its limits as a borough were extended by the addition of the parishes of  Christ Church, Bermondsey, and Rotherhithe, and also of the <QUOTE>Liberty of the Clink.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The Liberty of the Clink, as we learn from the <QUOTE>Penny Cyclopaedia</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>), belongs to the Bishop of Winchester, whose palace, of which we shall presently speak, stood near the western end of St. Saviour's Church, and who appoints for it-or, at all events, till very lately appointed--a steward and a bailiff. This part of Southwark appears not to kave been included in the grant to the City. 
   <P>In the <QUOTE>New View of London</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>) we read, <QUOTE>The Manor of Southwark, by some called the Clink Liberty, is, in extent, about a quarter of the parish of St. Saviour's. The civil government of it is under the Bishop of Winchester, who keeps court by his steward and bailiff, who hold pleas as at the Burrough <hi rend=italics>(sic</hi>) for debt, damage, &amp;c., for which manor there is a prison.</QUOTE> 
     <P>There is nothing romantic, to say the least, in the situation of Southwark. At the best it is a dead flat, unmixed by a single acre of rising ground. <QUOTE>What a contrast,</QUOTE> exclaims Charles Mackay, in <QUOTE>The Thames and its Tributaries,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>is there now, and always has been, in both the character and the appearance of the <num value="2">two</num> sides of the river! The   London side, high and well built, thickly studded with spires and public edifices, and resounding with all the noise of the operations of a various industry; the Southwark and Lambeth side, low and flat, and meanly built, with scarcely an edifice higher than a wool-shed or timber-yard, and a population with a squalid, dejected, and debauched look, offering a remarkable contrast to the cheerfulness and activity visible on the very faces of the   Londoners. The situation of Southwark upon the low swamp is, no doubt, <num value="1">one</num> cause of the unhealthy appearance of the dwellers on the south side of the   Thames; but the dissolute and rakish appearance of the lower orders among them must be otherwise accounted for. From a very early age, if the truth must be told, Southwark and Lambeth, and especially the former, were the great sinks and receptacles of all the vice and immorality of London.   Down to the year <datestruct value="1328"><year reg="1328">1328</year></datestruct> Southwark had been independent of the jurisdiction of London--a sort of neutral ground which the law could not reachand, in consequence, the abode of thieves and abandoned characters of every kind. They used to sally forth in bands of a <num value="100">hundred</num> or <num value="200">two hundred</num> at a time to rob in the City; and the Lord   Mayor and aldermen for the time being had not unfrequently to keep watch upon the bridge for nights together, at the head of a troop of armed men, to prevent their inroads.-The thieves, however, on these occasions took to their boats at midnight, and rowing up the river landed at <pb id="P.17" n="17"> Westminster, where they drove all before them with as much valour and as great impunity as a border chieftain upon a foray into Cumberland. These things induced the magistrates of London to apply to Edward III. for a grant of Southwark. The request was complied with, and the vicious place was brought under the rule of the City. Driven, in some measure, from their nest, the thieves took refuge in Lambeth, and still set the authorities at defiance. From that day to this the <num value="2">two</num> boroughs have had pretty much the same character, and have been known as the favourite resort of thieves and vagabonds of every description.</QUOTE> It is to be hoped that in this description of the character of the <QUOTE>Londoners over the water,</QUOTE> Dr. Mackay has written with a little of poetical licence, not to say exaggeration, as he certainly has over-stated the squalidity of their buildings. The huge palaces of commerce erected on either side of Southwark Street in <datestruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct> give the most palpable contradiction to his statements, which perhaps were a little in excess of the truth in <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, when he wrote. 
   <P>Down to the time of the demolition of Old London Bridge, and the consequent formation of the present broad approach to the new bridge, Southwark retained much of its antique character. The old High Street, then rich with its pointed gables, and half-timbered over-hanging storeys, with florid plaster-work and diamond casements, such as characterised the street architecture of ancient London--is now quite altered in appearance. All the picturesque features here mentioned have long been swept away, and their place was for a time supplied by the unbroken parapets and the monotonous brick front of lines of shops ; but even these in turn have in part been superseded by buildings altogether of another age and style; we refer to the Grecian and Italianised facade of the western side of the present <LEMMA id="lemma.17.1">High Street</LEMMA>, immediately on our right as we leave the bridge. 
   <P> <QUOTE>The street of Old Southwark,</QUOTE> writes John Timbs, in his <QUOTE>Autobiography,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>was in a line shelving down from the bridge, and crowded with traffic from morn till night. We remember, about <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, watching from   our nursery window the demolition of a long range of wood-and-plaster and gabled houses on the west side of High Street; and in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct> were removed <num value="2">two</num> houses of the time of Henry VII., with bay windows and picturesque plaster decorations, reported, though we know not with how much truth, to have been the abode of Queen Anne Boleyn.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Brayley, in his <QUOTE>History of Surrey,</QUOTE> remarks: <QUOTE>The principal street [of Southwark] is the High a Street, forming a portion of the great road from London through Surrey, and running in a southwesterly direction from   London   Bridge to St. Margaret's Hill, and thence to St. George's Church. The part between the bridge and St. Margaret's Hill was formerly called <hi rend=italics>Long</hi> Southwark, but is now called Wellington Street, from which the way is called High Street as far as St. George's Church.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Near the foot of the bridge, and at the point where the high level of the bridge begins to slope down to the original level of the ground, the road is crossed by the railway bridge over which are carried the lines connecting London Bridge station with the stations at Cannon Street and Charing Cross. Here, too, in the centre of the roadway, stood for some few years a clock-tower of Gothic design, surmounted by a spire, and originally intended, we believe, to have contained a statue of the Duke of Wellington.   The tower itself was erected about the year <datestruct value="1854"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>, but the statue was never placed in it; and having been found to be a continual block to the traffic over the bridge, the tower itself was in the end demolished. 
   <P>At the time of the alterations made here, in consequence of the rebuilding of London Bridge, advantage was taken to carry out another improvement for the benefit of the locality, namely, the erection of a new market-place.   Inconvenience having arisen from the situation of the old market, which used to be held in the High Street, between London Bridge and St. Margaret's Hill, <num value="2">two</num> Acts of Parliament were obtained in the middle of the last century, in pursuance of which a market-house was erected on a piece of ground westward of the High Street, called Rochester Yard, from having been formerly the site of a mansion belonging to the see of Rochester, which was taken down in the year <datestruct value="1604"><year reg="1604">1604</year></datestruct>, and the site of which is still marked by Rochester Street. The market-place now consists of a large open paved space on the south side of St. Saviour's churchyard; in <num value="1">one</num> corner of it a neat granite drinking-fountain has been erected.   Several buildings, of a light and airy character, to serve the purposes of the dealers and others in the market-which, by the way, is devoted to the sale of vegetables, &amp;c.-occupy the south side of the open space; the principal feature in these buildings is the large central dome. A considerable addition of space was made to the market-place in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct> by the demolition of the old St. Saviour's Grammar School, which had existed on that spot since the time of Queen Elizabeth. <QUOTE>The old school,</QUOTE> as we learn from the <hi rend=italics>Mirror,</hi>
vol. xxxv. (<datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE>was a handsome structure, with very spacious school-room, having the master's <pb id="P.18" n="18"> seat, with sounding-board over. The exterior was a brick fabric, consisting of <num value="3">three</num> casement windows on each side of a large doorway, ascended by <num value="3">three</num> semi-circular stone steps, with a handsome carved dome, representing <num value="2">two</num> children supporting the Bible. The <num value="2">second</num> storey had <num value="7">seven</num> lofty casement windows; the rooms panelled.   The school was screened from the churchyard by an iron railing.</QUOTE> 
   <P>When Queen Elizabeth came to the throne, following the example of her brother, Edward VI., she considered the importance of diffusing knowledge among the people, to forward which she not only re-founded the grammar-school of Westminster, but encouraged her subjects to such like acts of benevolence.

   <P>All that the parishioners obtained by this patent of Queen Elizabeth was to be made a corporate body with   succession;   the   queen   gave them nothing to endow their school. It seems to have been some time before they proceeded any farther, for the <num value="1">first</num> patent of Elizabeth granted a lease of the rectory for <num value="60">sixty</num> years, in order that a school should be erected; but by a subsequent patent it appears that it had not been built till after <datestruct value="1585--"><year reg="1585">1585</year></datestruct>.

    <P>Before the Reformation it was styled the priory church of St. Mary Overy, and its early history is almost lost in the mists of ancient tradition. There is a curious legend connecting the building of the original London Bridge with the church of St. Mary Overy, but it has been much discredited. The story is related on the authority of Stow, who chronicled it as the report of the last prior, Bartholomew Linsted:-- 
   <P> <QUOTE>A ferry being kept in the place where now the bridge is builded, at length the ferryman and his wife deceasing, left the same ferry to their only daughter, a maiden named Mary, who, with the goods left her by her parents, as also with the profits of the said ferry, builded an house of Sisters on the place where now standeth the east part of St. Mary Overy's Church, above the quire, where she was buried, unto which house she gave the oversight and profits of the ferry. But afterwards the said house of Sisters being converted into a college of priests, the priests builded the bridge of timber, as all the other great bridges of this land were, and from   time to time kept the same in good reparation; till at length, considering the great charges which were bestowed in the same, there was, by aid of the citizens and others, a bridge builded with stone.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The story of the miserly old ferryman, Audrey, Mary's father-how he counterfeited death in order that his household might forego a day's victuals, as he never supposed but that their sorrow   would make them fast at least so long; and how strangely he was deceived--has already been told by us.<NOTE>See Vol. II., p. <num value="9">9</num>.</NOTE> As the story, however-regardless of its improbability --is as closely connected with this venerable fabric as it is with London Bridge itself, we may be pardoned for recapitulating some of the main incidents of the tradition.   No sooner had the old man-so runs the story-been decently laid out, than those about him fell to feasting and making merry, rejoicing at the death of the old sinner, who, stretched in apparent death, bore their rioting for a short time, but at length sprang from his bed, and, seizing the <num value="1">first</num> weapon at hand, attacked his apprentice.   The encounter was fatal to him; and his daughter, the gentle, fair-haired Mary, the heiress of his wealth, devoted it to the establishment of a House of Sisters as above mentioned. The house bore her name of Mary Audrey, with the saintly prefix; but in the lapse of time, Audrey became corrupted into <QUOTE>Overie.</QUOTE> Some old writers, however, suggest that the religious house was originally founded in honour of the popular Saxon saint Audrey, or Etheldreda, of Ely.   But a more <pb id="P.21" n="21"> probable derivation of the name than either of the foregoing is from <QUOTE>over the rie,</QUOTE> that is <QUOTE>over the water.</QUOTE> Even in these days Londoners north of the Thames invariably designate the whole of the southern suburbs as <QUOTE>over the water;</QUOTE> and the phrase may perhaps be as old as the time of the building of St. Mary's <QUOTE>over the rie.</QUOTE> 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.21.1">William of Wickham, Bishop of Winchester</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>Long after the good Mary Audrey (or Overie) died-if, indeed, she ever lived--a noble lady named Swithen changed the House of Sisters into a college for priests; and in <datestruct value="1106--"><year reg="1106">1106</year></datestruct> <num value="2">two</num> Norman knights, William   Pont de l&lsquo;Arche and William Dauncey, re-founded it as a house for canons of the Augustine order. Giffard, then Bishop of Winchester, built the conventual church and the palace in Winchester Yard close by.   It was in this priory that the fire broke out in <datestruct value="1212--"><year reg="1212">1212</year></datestruct>, when the greater part of Southwark was destroyed, and another fire breaking out simultaneously at the northern end of London Bridge an immense crowd was enclosed between the <num value="2">two</num> fires, and <num value="3000">3,000</num> persons were burned or drowned.   The canons thus burnt out established a temporary place of worship on the opposite side of the main road, which they dedicated to St. Thomas, and occupied for about <num value="3">three</num> years until their own church was repaired. 
    <P>The church was then dedicated to St. Mary  Magdalen.   In <datestruct value="1273--"><year reg="1273">1273</year></datestruct>, Walter, Archbishop of York, granted an indulgence of <num value="30">thirty</num> days to all who should contribute to the rebuilding of the sacred edifice, and towards the end of the following century the church was entirely rebuilt.   Gower, the poet, it is stated, contributed a considerable portion of the funds. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1404--"><year reg="1404">1404</year></datestruct> Cardinal Beaufort was consecrated to the see of Winchester, and <num value="2">two</num> years later was celebrated in this church the marriage of Edmund  Holland, Earl of Kent, with Lucia, eldest daughter of Barnaby, Lord   of Milan.   <LEMMA id="lemma.21.2">Henry IV.</LEMMA> himself gave away the bride <QUOTE>at the church door,</QUOTE> and   afterwards conducted her to the marriage banquet at Winchester Palace.   It was in this church, too, a few years subsequently (<datestruct value="1424--"><year reg="1424">1424</year></datestruct>), that  James I. of Scotland wedded the daughter of the  Earl of Somerset, and niece of the great Cardinal, the golden-haired beauty, Jane Beaufort, of whom, during his imprisonment at Windsor, the royal poet had become enamoured, doubting, when he <num value="1">first</num> saw her from his window, whether she was 
                      <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L part=f>A worldly creature, 
             <L>Or heavenly thing in likeness of nature.</QUOTE>
  At all events, the king describes her in his verses as 
         <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>The fairest and the freshest yonge flower 
           <L>That ever I saw, methought, before that hour.</QUOTE>
 The marriage feast on this occasion, too, was kept in the great hall of Winchester Palace, and in a style befitting the munificence of the cardinal. The marriage, as we are told, was a happy <num value="1">one</num>, and the bards of Scotland vied with each other in singing the praises of the queen, and in extolling her beauty and her conjugal affection. In <datestruct value="1437--"><year reg="1437">1437</year></datestruct> James was murdered by his subjects, his brave queen being twice wounded in endeavouring to save his life. 
   <P>At the dissolution of religious houses, in <datestruct value="1539--"><year reg="1539">1539</year></datestruct>, the priory of black canons--for such was that of St. Mary Overy's--of course shared the general fate of monastic establishments; but the last prior, Bartholomew   Linsted, had the good fortune   of obtaining from   Henry VIII. a yearly pension of <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>. The inhabitants of the parishes of St. Mary Magdalen and St. Margaret-at-Hill--which latter church stood on the west side of the High Street, on the spot till recently occupied by the Town Hall-purchased, with the assistance of Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, the stately church of St. Mary. The priory church was also at the same time purchased from   the king, and the <num value="2">two</num> parishes were united under the title of St. Saviour's, the priory church having been recognised by the name of St. Saviour's for nearly <num value="30">thirty</num> years before. At the same time the churchwardens and vestry were constituted a <QUOTE>corporation sole.</QUOTE> <num value="6">Six</num> years before that period a dole had been given at the door of the church, and so great was the crowd and pressure on that occasion that several persons were killed. In pre-Reformation times this church was the scene of many religious ceremonies and public processions.   <num value="1">One</num> of these, conducted with great pomp and ceremony, is described by Fosbroke in his economy of monastic life, as follows:-- 
   <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Then <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="2">two</num> they march'd, and loud bells toll'd: 
     <L><num value="1">One</num> from a sprinkle holy water flung; 
     <L>This bore the relics from a chest of gold, 
     <L>On arm of that the swinging censor hung; 
     <L>Another loud a tinkling hand-bell rung. 
     <L><num value="4">Four</num> fathers went that singing monk behind, 
     <L>Who suited Psalms of Holy David sung; 
     <L>Then o&lsquo;er the cross a stalking sire inclined, 
     <L>And banners of the church went waving in the wind.</QUOTE>

     <P>Various alterations and restorations have at different times been made in the fabric of the church.   <LEMMA id="lemma.21.3">The Lady Chapel</LEMMA>, at the eastern end, is a relic of the older edifce.   The tower of the church was repaired in <datestruct value="1689--"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>; and in <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct> a complete restoration of the fine Gothic edifice was commenced.   The brick casings with which gene. rations of Goths had hidden the beautiful architecture were removed; groined roof and transepts were restored, and a circular window of rare beauty 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.21.4">Norman Arch</LEMMA></NOTE>
 <pb id="P.22" n="22"> added.   But even in this great work the taste of the age, as represented by the vestry and churchwardens, interfered; the noble vista of the longdrawn aisle was broken, and a new   and sorry modern nave constructed in its place. 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.22.1">Crypt of St. Mary Overy</LEMMA></NOTE>

    <P>The edifice is very spacious, and is built on the plan of a cathedral.   In its style of architecture, excepting its tower, it somewhat resembles Salisbury Cathedral.   It comprises a nave and aisles, transepts, <LEMMA id="lemma.22.2">a choir</LEMMA> with its aisles, and at the eastern end, as above stated, the chapel of the Blessed  Virgin, or, as it is more commonly called, the Lady  Chapel.   Contiguous, but extending farther eastward, was added a small chapel, which in time came to be called the Bishop's Chapel, from the tomb of  Bishop Andrewes having been placed in its centre.  This latter chapel was entered from   the Lady  Chapel under a large pointed arch.   The chapel itself was rather over <num value="30">thirty</num> feet in length, and had a stone seat on each side, and at the east end.  However, as it was thought to injure the effect of the eastern elevation of the church, as seen from the new bridge road, it was taken down in the year  <datestruct value="1830"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>.   A view of the Bishop's Chapel, from the last sketch that was taken of it, is given in Taylor's <QUOTE>Annals of St. Mary Overy.</QUOTE> 
   <P>At the intersection of the nave, transepts, and choir, rises a noble tower, <num value="35">35</num> feet square and <num value="150">150</num> feet in height, resting on <num value="4">four</num> massive pillars adorned   with   clustered   columns.   The   sharppointed arches are very lofty. The interior of the tower is in <num value="4">four</num> storeys, in the uppermost of which is a fine peal of <num value="12">twelve</num> bells.   Externally, the tower, which   is not older than   the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, somewhat resembles that of St. Sepulchre's Church, close by Newgate. It is divided into <num value="2">two</num> parts, with handsome pointed windows, in   <num value="2">two</num> storeys, on each front; it has tall pinnacles at each corner, and the battlements are of flint, in squares or chequer work. 
   <P>This tower has been in great jeopardy on more than <num value="1">one</num> occasion, once through the vibration caused by the ringing of the bells, when damage was done to the extent of several <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds</measure>; and more recently, when the south-eastern pinnacle was struck down by lightning, and fell upon the roof of the south transept, doing considerable damage. 
   <P>We are told that, during and after the progress of the Great Fire of London, Hollar busied himself from his old and favourite point of view, the summit of this tower, in delineating the appearance of the city as it lay in ruins, which is so well known to us by the help of the engraver's art. 
   <P>The western front of the church, as well as its southern side, has been restored with rubble-stone within the last half century in a style that reflects but little credit on the architect.   In each corner rises a slight octagonal tower.   In the buttresses, on each side of the large window, flintwork is ornamentally inserted.   Over the door, which is in <num value="3">three</num> compartments, in pointed arches, is a plain sunken entablature, occupying the space formerly devoted to a range of small pillars, forming niches, the centre having a bracket, on which is supposed to have stood the figure of the Virgin. From the repairs and alterations that have from time to time taken place in the fabric, the beauty of the interior, especially in the nave, has been much impaired. But it is still a noble structure; indeed, it has been proposed to restore the nave and make the church into a cathedral, as a memorial to the late Bishop Wilberforce. 
    <P>The nave, as it at present exists, is awkwardly reached from the transept by a flight of several steps, a huge screen blocking up the view from east to west. The roof of the nave originally was supported by <num value="26">twenty-six</num> columns, <num value="13">thirteen</num> on each side, of which the <num value="4">four</num> nearest the western end were of the massy round Norman character.   The other columns were octangular, with small clustercolumns added at the <num value="4">four</num> cardinal points. Corresponding with these columns are semi-columns in the walls, from which spring the arches of the aisles. There is a gallery in the window storey of the nave, which was formerly continued over the arches of the transept and choir. The altar-piece, or screen, at the east end of the nave forms a complete separation between this part of the structure and the choir. In fact, the transepts and chancel, under the existing arrangements, are utterly useless. 
    <P>From the great supporting columns of the tower to the altar-screen at the east end of the choir run <num value="5">five</num> lofty pointed arches, enriched with mouldings, and the groined roof, of stone, is exceedingly fine.  The screen   dividing the choir from   the Lady  Chapel is rich in its carving and decoration. On the east side of the south transept formerly stood the chapel of St. Mary Magdalen, founded and built by Peter de Rupibus, Bishop of Winchester.  This chapel was thus described by Mr. Nightingale in <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>The   chapel itself is a very plain erection. It is entered on the south, through a large pair of folding doors leading down a small flight of steps. The ceiling has nothing peculiar in its character; nor are the <num value="4">four</num> pillars supporting the roof, and the unequal arches leading into the south aisle, in the least calculated to convey any idea of grandeur or feeling of veneration.   These arches have been cut through in a very clumsy manner, so that scarcely any vestige of the ancient <pb id="P.23" n="23"> church of St. Mary Magdalen now remains. A small doorway and windows, however, are still visible at the east end of this chapel; the west end formerly opened into the south transept; but that also is now walled up, except a part, which leads to the gallery there. There are in different parts niches which once held the holy water, by which the pious devotees of former ages sprinkled their foreheads on their entrance before the altar. I am not aware that any other remains of the old church are now visible in this chapel.   Passing through the eastern end of the south aisle, a pair of gates leads into the Virgin Mary's Chapel.</QUOTE> A correspondent of the <hi rend=italics>Mirror</hi>, writing in <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>, says that it was this chapel, and not the Lady Chapel as had been previously stated, that contained the gravestone of <num value="1">one</num> Bishop Wickham, who, however, was not the famous builder of Windsor Castle in the time of Edward III., but who died in <datestruct value="1595--"><year reg="1595">1595</year></datestruct>, the same year in which he was translated from the see of Lincoln to that of Winchester. <QUOTE>His gravestone,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>now lying exposed in the churchyard, marks the south-east corner of the site of the aforesaid Magdalen Chapel.</QUOTE> This chapel was pulled down in <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>.   Amongst the alterations and additions consequent on its removal are the present windows and doorway of the transept. The angle formed by the north transept and the choir was formerly the Chapel of St. John, now appropriated as the vestry.   Beyond the choir-screen, as already mentioned, is the Lady Chapel, which was restored by Mr. Gwilt in <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>; its <num value="4">four</num> gables and groined roof are very fine. In Queen Mary's time it was used as a consistorial court by Bishop Gardiner, and here Bishop Hooper and John Rogers were tried as heretics, and condemned to the stake. 
   <P>After the parish had obtained the grant of the church, the Lady Chapel was let to <num value="1">one</num> Wyat, a baker, who converted it into a bakehduse.   He stopped up the <num value="2">two</num> doors which communicated with the aisles of the church, and the <num value="2">two</num> which opened into the chancel, and which, though visible, long remained masoned up.   In <datestruct value="1607--"><year reg="1607">1607</year></datestruct> Mr. Henry Wilson, tenant of the Chapel of the Holy Virgin, found himself inconvenienced by a tomb <QUOTE>of a certain cade,</QUOTE> and applied to the vestry for its removal, which, as recorded in the parish books, was very <QUOTE>friendly</QUOTE> consented to, <QUOTE>making the place up again in any reasonable sort.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The following curious particulars of the Lady Chapel appear in Strype's edition of Stow's Survey:--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>It is now called the <hi rend=italics>New</hi> Chapel; and indeed, though very old, it now may be called a new <num value="1">one</num>; because newly redeemed from such use and employment as, in respect of that it was built to (divine and religious duties), may very well be branded with the style of wretched, base, and unworthy. For that which, before this abuse, was, and is now, a fair and beautiful chapel, was, by those that were then the corporation, &amp;c., leased and let out, and this house of God made a bakehouse. 
    <P><num value="2">Two</num> very fair doors, that from the <num value="2">two</num> sideaisles of the chancel of the church, acid <num value="2">two</num>, that through the head of the chancel went into it, were lathed, daubed, and dammed up: the fair pillars were ordinary posts, against which   they piled billets and bavins. In this place they had their ovens; in that, a bolting-place; in that, their kneading-trough; in another, I have heard, a hog's trough.   For the words that were given me were these:--<QUOTE>This place have I known a hog-sty; in another, a store-house, to store zp their hoarded-meal; and, in all of it, something of this sordid kind and condition.</QUOTE></QUOTE>

    <P>The writer then goes on to mention the <num value="4">four</num> persons, all bakers, to whom in succession it was let by the corporation; and adds, that <num value="1">one</num> part was turned into a starch-house. 
    <P>In this state it continued till the year <datestruct value="1624"><year reg="1624">1624</year></datestruct>, when the vestry restored it to its original condition, at an expense of <measure value="200l." type=currency><num value="200">two hundred</num> pounds</measure>.   In the course of <num value="2">two</num> centuries it again became ruinous; and in <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct> a public subscription was commenced, and the beautiful chapel was thoroughly restored.  The roof is divided into <num value="9">nine</num> groined arches, supported by <num value="6">six</num> octangular pillars in <num value="2">two</num> rows, having small circular columns at the <num value="4">four</num> points.  In the east end, on the north side, are <num value="3">three</num> lancet-shaped windows, forming <num value="1">one</num> great window, divided by slender pillars, and having mouldings with zigzag ornaments.   At the north-east corner of the chapel, a portion had been divided off from the rest by a wooden enclosure, in which were a table, desk, and elevated seat.   This part was the  Bishop's court; but it was usual to give this name to the whole chapel, in which the Bishop of  Winchester, even almost down to the time of the above-mentioned restoration, held his court, and in which were also held the visitations of the deanery of Southwark. 
    <P>At the east end of the Lady Chapel, as stated above, was Bishop Andrewes' Chapel, which was ascended by <num value="2">two</num> steps, and was so called from the tomb of <LEMMA id="lemma.24.1">Dr. Lancelot Andrewes</LEMMA>, Bishop of Winchester, standing in the centre of it. The Bishop's  Chapel having been wholly taken down, this fine monument has been   removed   into   the Lady  Chapel.   The Bishop is represented the size of life, in a recumbent posture, and dressed in his <pb id="P.24" n="24"> robes, as prelate of the Order of the Garter. Originally this tomb had a handsome canopy, supported by <num value="4">four</num> black marble pillars; but the roof of the Bishop's Chapel falling in, and the chapel itself being much defaced by fire, in <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>, the canopy was broken, and not repaired. In taking down the monument, at the time of the demolition of the Bishop's Chapel, a heavy leaden coffin, containing the remains of the deceased prelate, and marked with his initials <QUOTE>L.

He was born in London in <datestruct value="1555--"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct>, and received the rudiments of his education <num value="1">first</num> at the free school of the Coopers' Company, in Ratcliff Highway, and afterwards at the Merchant Taylors' School.   He afterwards graduated at Pembroke College, Cambridge.   He soon became widely known for his great learning; and, in due course, found a patron in the Earl of Huntingdon, whose chaplain he became.   After holding for a short time a living in an obscure village in Hampshire, he was appointed Vicar of St. Giles's, Cripplegate, and in a short time after, prebendary and residentiary of St. Paul's, and also prebendary of the collegiate church of Southwell. In these several capacities he distinguished himself as a diligeni and   excellent preacher, and   he read   divinity <pb id="P.25" n="25"> lectures <num value="3">three</num> days in the week at St. Paul's during term time. Upon the death of Dr. Fulke, he was chosen master of Pembroke Hall, to which college he afterwards became a considerable benefactor. He was next appointed <num value="1">one</num> of the chaplains in ordinary to Queen Elizabeth, who took great delight in his preaching, and promoted him to the deanery of Westminster, in <datestruct value="1601--"><year reg="1601">1601</year></datestruct>. He refused a bishopric in this reign, because he would not submit to the spoliation of the ecclesiastical revenues. In the next, however, he had no cause for such scruple, and having published a work in defence of King James's book on the <QUOTE>Rights of Sovereigns,</QUOTE> against Cardinal Bellarmine, he was advanced to the bishopric of Chichester, and at the same time appointed lord-almoner. He was translated to the see of Ely in <datestruct value="1609--"><year reg="1609">1609</year></datestruct>; and in the same year he was sworn of the king's privy council in England, as he was afterwards of Scotland, upon attending his majesty to that kingdom. 
   <P>When he had sat <num value="9">nine</num> years in the see of Ely, he was translated to that of Winchester, and also appointed dean of the royal chapel; and to his honour it is recorded of him, that these preferments were conferred upon him without any court

 interest, or solicitations on the part of himself or his friends: it is likewise observed, that though he was a privy councillor in the reigns of James I. and Charles I., he interfered very little in temporal concerns; but in all affairs relative to the Church, and the duties of his office, he was remarkably diligent and active. After a long life of honour and tranquillity, in which he enjoyed the esteem of <num value="3">three</num> successive sovereigns, the friendship of all men of letters, his contemporaries, and the veneration of all who knew him, Bishop Andrewes died at Winchester House, in Southwark, in <datestruct VALUE="1626-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1626">1626</year></datestruct>, at the age of <num value="71">seventy-one</num>. 
    <P><num value="1">One</num> of the most ancient memorials preserved in the church is the oaken <LEMMA id="lemma.26.1">cross-legged effigy</LEMMA> of <num value="1">one</num> of the Norman knights who founded the priory; it is in a low recess in the north wall of the choir.  But better known is the <LEMMA id="lemma.26.2">monument on the east side of the south transept, to John Gower</LEMMA>, the poet, and his wife. <QUOTE>This tomb,</QUOTE> says Cunningham, <QUOTE>was originally erected on the north side of the church, where Gower founded a chantry.   It was removed to its present site, and repaired and coloured, in <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>, at the expense of the Duke of  Sutherland, whose family claimed relationship or <pb id="P.26" n="26"> descent from the poet Gower.   But, according to the <hi rend=italics>Athenaeum</hi> (No. <num value="1537">1,537</num>, p. <num value="68">68</num>), Sir H. Nicolas and Dr. Pauli have shown that the family of the Duke of Sutherland and Lord Ellesmere must relinquish all pretension to being related to, or even descended from, John Gower.   They have hitherto depended solely upon the possession of the MS. of the  <Q>Confessio Amantis,</Q>  which was supposed to have been presented to an ancestor by the poet; but it turns out, on the authority of  Sir Charles Young, that it was the very copy of the work which the author laid at the feet of  King   Henry IV. while he was yet Harry of  Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby!</QUOTE> 
    <P>Gower, as we have stated above, contributed largely towards the rebuilding of the church at the close of the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century. He was certainly a rich man for a poet, and he gave, doubtless, large sums during the progress of the work; but it is absurd to suppose, as some have imagined, that the sacred edifice was wholly built by his money. Lest any such foolish idea should be entertained, Dr. Mackay, in his <QUOTE>Thames and. its Tributaries,</QUOTE> places on record the following witty epigram:-- 
   <QUOTE REND=blockquote>This church was rebuilt by John Gower, the rhymer,      Who in Richard's gay court was a fortunate climber;      Should any <num value="1">one</num> start, &lsquo;tis but right he should know it,      Our wight was a lawyer as well as a poet.</QUOTE>

   <P>The   fact is that Gower was a <QUOTE>fortunate climber,</QUOTE> not only in the court of Richard, but in that of the Lancastrian king who succeeded him. I ike many other poets, he <QUOTE>worshipped the rising sun,</QUOTE> and his reward was that, to use his own words, <QUOTE>the king laid a charge upon him,</QUOTE> namely, to write a poem. It is commonly supposed that he was poet laureate to both of the above-mentioned kings; but if this was the case, the post was its own reward-at all events, no salary is known to have been attached to it. 
   <P>Gower is, perhaps, the earliest poet who has sung the praises of the Thames by name.   He relates in <num value="1">one</num> of his quaint poems how that being on the river in his boat, he met the royal barge containing King Henry IV. :-- 
                         <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L part=f>As I came nighe,

    <P>The Chapel of St. John, in the north transept of this church, having been burnt and nearly destroyed in the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century, was sumptuously rebuilt by Gvwer almost at his sole cost; he founded also a chantry there, endowing it with money for a mass to be said daily for the repose of his soul, and an <QUOTE>obit</QUOTE> to be performed on the morrow after the feast of St. Gregory. In this chapel, we are quaintly told, <QUOTE>he prepared for his bones a resting, and there, somewhat after the old fashion, he lieth right sumptuously buried, with a garland on his head, in token that he in his life-daies flourished freshly in literature and science.</QUOTE> The stone effigy on his tomb represented the poet with long auburn hair reaching down to his shoulders and curling up gracefully, a small curled beard, and on his head a chaplet of red roses (Leland says that there was a <QUOTE>wreath of joy</QUOTE> interspersed with the roses); the robe was of green damask reaching down to the feet; a collar of SS. in gold worn round the neck, and under his head effigies of the <num value="3">three</num> chief books which he had compiled, viz., the <QUOTE>Speculum Meditantis,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Vox Clamantis,</QUOTE> and the <QUOTE>Confessio Amantis.</QUOTE> On the wall hard by were painted effigies of <num value="3">three</num> virtues-Charity,  Mercy, and Pity--with crowns on their heads, and each bearing her own device in her hand. That of  Charity ran thus : 
            <QUOTE REND=blockquote lang=fr><L>En toy qui es fils de Dieu le Pere, 
              <L>Sauve soit qui gist soubs cest piere.</QUOTE>
That of Mercy thus:-- 
            <QUOTE REND=blockquote lang=fr><L>O bone Jesu, fais la mercie 
              <L>A lame dont le corps gist icy.</QUOTE>
Whilst that of Pity ran as follows : 
            <QUOTE REND=blockquote lang=fr><L>Par ta Pitie, Jesu, regarde 
              <L>Et met cest aime en sauve garde.</QUOTE>
Not far off was also a tablet with this inscription:-- <QUOTE>Whoso prayeth for the soul of John Gower, as oft as he does it, shall have M.D. days of pardon.</QUOTE> Gower's wife, we may add, was buried near him. 
   <P>We know little enough of Gower--the <QUOTE>moral Gower,</QUOTE> as Chaucer calls him-except that he came of a knightly family connected with Yorkshire, and that he owned property not far from London, to the south of the Thames, and probably in Kent. Though no lover of abuses, he was a firm   and zealous supporter of the ancient Church, and opposed to the fanaticism of those sectaries who from   time to time endeavoured to uphold the standard of reform in matters of faith. Henry IV., before he came to the throne, conferred on him the Lancastrian badge of the Silver Swan. <pb id="P.27" n="27"> 
   <P> <QUOTE>Of the rest of his life,</QUOTE> writes Dr. R. Pauli, in his <QUOTE>Pictures of Old England,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>we know, in truth, very little. It was not till his old age, when his hair was grey, that, wearying of his solitary state, he took a wife in the person of <num value="1">one</num> Agnes Groundolf, to whom he was married on the <datestruct VALUE="1397-01-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1397">1397</year></datestruct>. His very comprehensive will does not mention any children, but it makes ample provision for the faithful companion and nurse of his latter years. After prolonged debility and sickness, he lost his eye-sight in the year <datestruct value="1401"><year reg="1401">1401</year></datestruct>, and was then compelled to lay aside his pen for ever.   He died in the autumn of <datestruct value="1408--"><year reg="1408">1408</year></datestruct>, when upwards of <num value="80">eighty</num> years of age. He lies buried in St. Saviour's Church, near the southern side of London Bridge; and we find from his last will that he had been connected in several ways with London, through his estates, which were all in the neighbourhood of the City. St. John's Chapel, in the church already refered to, still contains the monument which he had himself designed, and which, notwithstanding the many subsequent renovations which it has undergone, is tolerably well preserved. He lies clothed in the long closelybuttoned habit of his day, with his order on his breast, and his coat of arms by his side; but whether the face, with its long locks, and the wreath around the head, is intended as a portrait, it is difficult to say. Greater significance attaches . . .  to the <num value="3">three</num> volumes on which his head is resting, and which may be said to symbolise his life--the <title lang=la>Speculum   Meditantis</title>, the <title lang=la>Vox Clamantis</title>, and <title lang=la>Confessio Amantis</title>.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Gower's works maintained their popularity long beyond the age in which his lot was cast, as may be gathered from the fact that his was the mine from which Shakespeare drew the materials for his <hi rend=italics>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</hi>. In <datestruct value="1402--"><year reg="1402">1402</year></datestruct>, when blind and full of years, he followed his old friend Chaucer to the tomb. Prosaic and unpoetical as is now the aspect of Southwark, there is no spot in this great metropolis more worthy of being called the Poet's Corner.   Chaucer, as we shall presently see, has conferred upon the Tabard Inn a literary immortality. Shakespeare himself dwelt for many years in a narrow street close by the church of St. Mary Overy; there he wrote many of his great dramas, while the neighbouring Bankside witnessed their performance. Edmund Shakespeare was, as the register-book of the parish tells us, a <QUOTE>player,</QUOTE> no doubt through the connection of his brother with the Globe Theatre hard by. He was the immortal poet's youngest brother. The register at Stratford-on-Avon tells us that he was baptised there on the <datestruct VALUE="1580-05-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1580">1580</year></datestruct>; that of St. Saviour's records the fact that he was buried here on the last day of the year <datestruct value="1607"><year reg="1607">1607</year></datestruct>.   So probably William Shakespeare stood by his grave. Such is the brief summary of all that is known to history of Edmund Shakespeare; <QUOTE>and,</QUOTE> as Mr. Dyce remarks, <QUOTE>since his connection with the stage is ascertained from no other source, he probably was not distinguished in his profession.</QUOTE> 
   <P><LEMMA id="lemma.27.1">Fletcher</LEMMA>, the friend and fellow play-writer with Shakespeare, died of the plague of London, in <datestruct VALUE="1625-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1625">1625</year></datestruct>, at the age of <num value="46">forty-six</num>, and was buried in this church. He had survived his friend and literary partner, Beaumont--with whom   he lived at Bankside-just <num value="9">nine</num> years. John Fletcher was a son of the Rev. Dr. Richard Fletcher, who was successively Bishop of Bristol, of Worcester, and of London, under Queen Bess. The names of Beaumont and Fletcher appear as jointly responsible for upwards of <num value="50">fifty</num> dramas, but there are reasons for thinking that Fletcher had not much to do with more than half that number. The circumstances of his death are thus described by Sir John Aubrey:-- <QUOTE>In the great plague of <datestruct value="1625--"><year reg="1625">1625</year></datestruct>, a knight of Norfolk or Suffolk invited him into the country. He stayed in London but to make himself a suit of clothes, and when it was making, fell sick and died. This I heard from the tailor, who is now a very old man, and clerk of St. Marie Overie.</QUOTE> 
   <P> <QUOTE>From   the proximity of this church to the Globe Theatre and others on Bankside,</QUOTE> writes Dr. Mackay, in his <QUOTE>Thames and its Tributaries,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>many of the players of Shakespeare's time who resided in the neighbouring alleys found a final resting-place here when their career was over. Among others, unhappily, Philip Massinger, steeped in poverty to the very lips, died in some hovel adjacent, and was buried like a pauper at the expense of the parish.</QUOTE> Born at Salisbury, in the year <datestruct value="1584"><year reg="1584">1584</year></datestruct>, and having been educated at Alban Hall, Oxford, Philip Massinger, the playwright and poet, and the friend and immediate successor of Shakespeare, came to London to seek his bread by his pen, which furnished nearly <num value="40">forty</num> plays for the stage. But in spite of their great celebrity at the time when they were written and performed, few of them are known to the present race of playgoers. <hi rend=italics>A New   Way to Pay Old Debts</hi> is occasionally performed; and the <hi rend=italics>Fatal Dowry</hi> and 
<hi rend=italics>Riches</hi> (altered from <hi rend=italics>The City Madam</hi>) have been found amongst modern revivals. Massinger's last days were probably spent in Southwark, though accounts differ as to the latter portion of his career. He died in <datestruct value="1639--"><year reg="1639">1639</year></datestruct>, for the register in that year records, <QUOTE>buried, Philip Massinger, a - <pb id="P.28" n="28"> stranger;</QUOTE> that is, a non-parishioner. It is probable, therefore, that he wished in death to be joined with some of those who had been his fellow-craftsmen. His grave is unmarked by any stone or other memorial. 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.28.1">Tombs and Monuments in Southwark</LEMMA></NOTE>

    <P>Among the remaining monuments in St. Saviour's  Church is <num value="1">one</num> bearing the following epitaph on a member of the Grocers' Company:--

      <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Such grace the King of kings bestowed upon her 
        <L>That now she lives with Him a maid of honour.</QUOTE>

    <P>Near the tomb of the poet Gower is <LEMMA id="lemma.28.2">another which exhibits a diminutive effigy of a man</LEMMA>, an emaciated figure, in a winding-sheet, lying on a marble sarcophagus. At the back is a black tablet with the following inscription in letters of gold:-- 
    <QUOTE REND=blockquote><p>Here vnder lyeth the body of <name rend=caps>William Emerson</name>, who lived and died an honest man.

   <P>A   curious effigy is that lying on the floor, on the east side of the north transept, which has been supposed by some persons to be that of the old <QUOTE>ferryman</QUOTE> above spoken of.   Grose has inserted a representation of this figure in his <QUOTE>Antiquities of England and Wales,</QUOTE> observing that it is a skeleton-like figure, of which the usual story is told that the person thereby represented attempted to fast for <num value="40">forty</num> days in imitation of Christ, but died in the attempt, having <num value="1">first</num> reduced himself to that appearance.   There is also an engraving of this effigy in J. T. Smith's <QUOTE>Antiquities of London and its Environs,</QUOTE> <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">4</num>to.   Be this figure, however, who or what it may, at all events its monument has long survived him; whether he carried passengers over the river Thames, or was occupied in teaching others how to cross that last fatal river which, as John Bunyan so quaintly says, <QUOTE>hath no bridge,</QUOTE> can matter but little to us now. 
   <P>St. Saviour's parish church differs in point of clerical administration   from   almost every other church in the kingdom, for it has neither rector nor vicar, nor what is popularly called a <QUOTE>curate,</QUOTE> but under a peculiar grant the tithes are secured to the churchwardens for the maintenance of <num value="2">two</num> chaplains or preachers at their pleasure. These chaplains are neither presented nor inducted like the incumbents of parishes in general.   In fact, the parishioners elect their own preachers, like Congregationalist bodies. 
    <P>There is an interesting view of St. Mary Overy's  Church among the etchings of Hollar; it was worked at Antwerp in <datestruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct>.   The view is taken from   the north, and shows a porch leading into the north aisle of the chancel; there is also an ugly side aisle of Jacobean architecture running on the north side parallel to the nave. Another etching by the same artist, of which we give a copy on page <num value="30">30</num>, taken from the other side of the church, shows a glimpse of St. Paul's and the City across the river.   Hollar's studies of buildings, his little landscape and water-side etchings, are always charming.   He is an excellent delineator of architecture, his drawing and perspective being admirably executed.   He can render landscape also with great subtilty, giving, for instance, in a small sketch of a few inches square the knolls and hollows of a piece of hilly river-bank with marvellous truth and naturalness. Some <num value="1">one</num> has written of Hollar that, <QUOTE>whether dealing with brick and stone, or fields and streams, he is always dexterous and exact; and if we were asked to name the principal characteristic of his work, we should say it was a perfectly simple and earnest striving after truth.   To some modern etchers, who have all sorts of marvellous methods of their own, who cover the paper with an incomprehensible chancemedley of black lines and call it  <Q>green moonlight sleeping on a bank,</Q>  or something of the sort,  Hollar's art may appear but homely, for it is only the art of transferring what was before him to paper, so that others may see it as he saw it.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The antiquarian author of <QUOTE>Chronicles of London  Bridge</QUOTE> tells us that in his day, when the churchwardens and vestrymen of St. Mary Overy's met for convivial purposes, <num value="1">one</num> of their earliest toasts was that of their church's patron saint, under the irreverent name of <QUOTE>Old Moll.</QUOTE> It is to be hoped that such gross irreverence is now at an end. 
    <P>St. Saviour's and its neighbourhood have, however, much historic interest on quite another score; for adjoining the northern side of St. Saviour's Church, and   on   the site of the   Cloisters, Sir Anthony Browne, Viscount Montague, built after the Dissolution a handsome mansion, which gave name to the still existing <LEMMA id="lemma.29.1">Montague Close</LEMMA>. In the memorable year <datestruct value="1605"><year reg="1605">1605</year></datestruct>, Lord Monteagle was residing there when he received the anonymous letter advising him <QUOTE>as you tender your life, to devise you some excuse to shift off your attendance at this Parliament, for God and man have concurred to punish the wickedness of this time.</QUOTE> The suspicions excited by this mysterious warning led to the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot.   Monteagle. was rewarded by a grant of      <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure> per annum in <pb id="P.29" n="29"> land and a pension of <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>   in hard cash; and in remembrance of the great event, persons then and afterwards residing in Montague Close were exempted from actions for debt or trespass. The place became, in fact, a sort of minor sanctuary. the privileges of which grew ultimately to be such a public nuisance that they were suppressed by the strong arm of the law.

<P>The site of the Priory of St. Mary Overy, and of Winchester House, the palace of the Bishops of Winchester, adjoins the north-west corner of the nave of St. Saviour's Church, and extends towards Southwark Bridge; it is now occupied by various wharves, warehouses, manufactories, and other buildings, among them being the new Bridge House Hotel, which opens on the main street, close by the foot of London Bridge.   Of the priory we have already spoken in the preceding chapter. Winchester House was built early in the <num value="12">twelfth</num> century, by Walter Giffard, Bishop of Winchester, on land held of the prior of Bermondsey. Stow, in his <QUOTE>Chronicles,</QUOTE> mentions it as being in his time <QUOTE>a very fair house, well repaired, with a large wharf and landing-place, called the Bishop of Winchester's Stairs.</QUOTE> It was, in fact, a stately palace, with gardens, fountains, fish-ponds, and an extensive park-long known as Southwark Parkwhich reached back nearly as far, in the direction of Lambeth, as Gravel Lane, and which is still kept in remembrance by <QUOTE>Park</QUOTE> Street. In New Park Street is--or rather was--the chapel in which Mr. C. H. Spurgeon <num value="1">first</num> became known as a popular preacher.   The congregation formerly assembling in the Baptist meeting-house in Carter Lane, Tooley Street, migrated to New Park Street Chapel in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, on the demolition of their old chapel to make room for the approaches to new London Bridge; and here they continued till, under the pastorate of <LEMMA id="lemma.29.2">Mr. Spurgeon</LEMMA>, they migrated to tihe music-hall in the Surrey Gardens, Newington, and finally to the <LEMMA id="lemma.29.3">Metropolitan Tabernacle</LEMMA>.   The chapel in Park Street has since become converted to business purposes, and has been made to serve as a store-room or goods depot. 
    <P>Winchester Yard, between St. Saviour's Church and Messrs. Barclay and Co.&lsquo;s brewery, in Park  Street, occupies the place of the court-yard of the old palace; and Messrs. Potts's extensive vinegar works, on part of the site of the park, are, we believe, still held under lease direct from the see of Winchester. 
    <P>Cardinal Beaufort lived here in the early part of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century, whilst holding the important see of Winchester. In his time the great hall of the palace, which ran east and west parallel with the river, was the scene of a splendid banquet, for here took place the marriage-feast on the occasion of the matrimonial alliance of James I. of  Scotland with the Lady Joan Somerset, daughter of the Earl of Somerset, as stated in the previous chapter.   But the palace witnessed at times other scenes besides those of festivity; for we read of great <QUOTE>brawls</QUOTE> taking place between the cardinal's servants and the citizens at the Bridge Gate. Old  Stow describes a disgraceful scene which took place in Winchester House, when the insurgents against the government of Queen Mary, under Sir Thomas  Wyatt, had entered Southwark, on the <datestruct VALUE="1554-02-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of  <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct>. Wyatt's intention was to have entered the City by way of London Bridge, as we have already seen; but notwithstanding that the citizens of London had cut down the drawbridge, <pb id="P.30" n="30"> the inhabitants of the borough received him well. Sir Thomas issued a proclamation that no soldier of his should take anything without paying for it; notwithstanding which, some of them attacked the Bishop of Winchester's house, made havoc of his goods, and cut to pieces all his books, <QUOTE>so that men might have gone up to their knees in the leaves so torn out.</QUOTE> Wyatt stayed here only <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> days, when the inhabitants, finding that the Governor of the Tower of London had planted several pieces of ordnance against the foot of the bridge and on the steeples of St. Olave and St. Mary Overy, became alarmed, and desired Sir Thomas to leave them, which he did. 
   <P>The Swedish envoy, John, Duke of Finland, was lodged in the Bishop of Winchester's palace when he came to solicit the hand of Queen Elizabeth for his elder brother, Eric, the son and heir of the King of Sweden. He went in state to visit the Queen at Greenwich; but his father's death recalled him to Sweden. 
   <P>Bishop Lancelot Andrewes, as we have already stated, died at Winchester House in <datestruct value="1626--"><year reg="1626">1626</year></datestruct>, and was carried hence to his last resting-place in St. Saviour's Church.   <num value="20">Twenty</num> years later, the Presbyterians

 turned the episcopal palace into a prison for the royalists; and in <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct> it was sold for <measure value="4380l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4380">4,380</num></measure> to <num value="1">one</num> Thomas Walker, of Camberwell. It was recovered by the Bishop of Winchester, at the Restoration, but was not again used as a residence. Until the time of the civil wars, the Bishops of Winchester resided here during the sitting of Parliament; but afterwards they removed to Chelsea, where, as we have seen,<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="53">53</num>.</NOTE> they had another house provided for them under the sanction of an Act of Parliament in <datestruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>.   A part of the palace was standing, occupied as tenements and warehouses, till within the last few years, a fire which occurred in August. <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, having destroyed some of the surrounding buildings, and brought to view a portion of the old hall, with a magnificent circular window. 
   <P>Allen, in his <QUOTE>History of Surrey,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, says, <QUOTE>Vain would be the attempt to deter. mine the extent and arrangement of this palace from its present remains. The site was probably divided into <num value="2">two</num> or more grand courts, the principal of which appears to have had its range of state apartments fronting the river; and part of this <pb id="P.31" n="31"> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.031" n="2000.14.0014"><HEAD>Winchester House. (From A View By Hollar, <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="P.32" n="32"> range is now almost the only elevation that can be traced. Though its external decorations on the north or river front have been either destroyed or bricked up, yet in the other, facing the south, are many curious doorways and windows in various styles, from that of the Early Pointed down to the era of Henry VIII., but wofully mutilated, and concealed by sheds, stables, and warehouses.</QUOTE> What little remained of the palace after the fire above mentioned was very soon considerably diminished.   The great wall, which divided the hall from the other apartments, with the large circular window, some <num value="14">fourteen</num> feet in diameter, was built against in the early part of <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>. There was likewise remaining a doorway, in the spandrils of which appeared the arms of Bishop Gardiner, and the same impaling those of the see of Winchester. A correspondent of the <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi>, writing at the above period, observes that <QUOTE>this doorway is connected with, and, in fact, led into, a range of buildings shown in Hollar's  <Q> View of London,</Q>  <hi rend=italics>circa</hi> <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, branching southward of the hall to a considerable distance, much of which is still standing.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The antiquary Pennant, whilst pretending to do nothing of the kind, insinuates that the Bishops of Winchester and Rochester, and the Abbots of St. Augustine's, Canterbury, Lewes, Hyde,  Waverley, and Battel, had their town residences here on account of their adjoining the Bordello or <QUOTE>Stews</QUOTE> on the Bankside. These <QUOTE>stews</QUOTE> comprised nearly <num value="20">twenty</num> houses along the river-side, and were licensed under certain regulations confirmed by Act of Parliament. 
    <P>The houses, which were indeed a most unsavoury adjunct to Southwark, were nothing more nor less than a collection of public brothels, leased from the Bishops of Winchester by various persons, <num value="1">one</num> of whom was no other than Sir William Walworth, who struck down Wat Tyler, and thus gave the dagger to the City arms. We read that, <QUOTE>on  Thursday the Feast of Corpus Christi, <datestruct VALUE="1381-06-13"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=13>13th</day>,  <year reg=1381>1381</year></datestruct>, in the morning the Commons of Kent brake down the stew-houses near to London Bridge, at that time in the hands of the power of Flanders, who had farmed them of the Mayor of London.  After which they went to London Bridge, in the hopes to have entered the City; but the mayor  (the famous Sir William Walworth) coming thither before, fortified the place, caused the bridge to be drawn up, and fastened a great chaine of yron acrosse to restraine their entry.</QUOTE> Thus wrote  Stow, and the same story is told in other words by the old chronicler, Thomas of Walsingham. 
     <P>As far back as <datestruct value="1162--"><year reg="1162">1162</year></datestruct>, some Parliamentary <QUOTE>Ordinances</QUOTE> were issued, <QUOTE>touching the government of the Stewholders in Southwark, under the direction of the Lord Bishop of Winchester;</QUOTE> the purpose of which seems to have been to restore the state of things there, <QUOTE>accordinge to the ovlde customes that hath been vsed and accustomed tyme out of mynde.</QUOTE> These regulations were numerous; no single woman was to be kept against her will, and all were <QUOTE>to be voyded out of the lordship</QUOTE> on Sundays and other holidays. When the ordinances were <num value="1">first</num> enjoined, the number of stewhouses was eighteen; but in the reign of Henry VII., when some fresh regulations were made, it was reduced to <num value="12">twelve</num>.   <num value="1">One</num> of the houses, says Pennant, but he gives no authority for the statement, bore the sign of the <QUOTE>Cardinal's Hat.</QUOTE> Cardinal's Cap Alley is, however-or, at all events, was till lately--to be found in the neighbourhood. If the holders of the houses broke certain wholesome rules which wvere issued respecting them, they were committed to the episcopal prison of the Clink, at the corner of Maid Lane. This prison was removed in <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct> to Deadman's Place, Bankside (so named from   the number buried there during the great plague), but was burnt down in the riots of <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, and no other prison has since taken its place. The poor women living in these houses, though licensed by the bishops, were not allowed Christian burial, but were thrown when dead into unconsecrated graves at a spot called the Cross Bones, at the corner of Redcross Street. Henry VII. closed these dens of infamy, but they were soon   opened again, though his son and successor finally cleared them out, having issued a proclamation enjoining his subjects <QUOTE>to avoide the abominable place called the Stewes.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In Holland Street, at the end of Bankside, near  Blackfriars Bridge, was another notorious <QUOTE>stew</QUOTE> frequented   by King James I. and   his court; amongst others by the royal favourite, George  Villiers, as we learn from a little tract entitled <QUOTE>Holland's Leaguer.</QUOTE> It is recorded that <QUOTE>many of the inhabitants of the Bankside, especially those who lived in the stews adjoining the palace of the  Bishops of Winchester, were known throughout  London by the court term   of the  <Q>Winchester  Birds.</Q>    Low   players also, then ranking (not, perhaps, quite undeservingly) with these and other similar characters, under the common designation of vagabonds, flocked together to the same spot, together with   fraudulent bankrupts, swindlers, debtors, and all sorts of persons who had misunderstandings with the law, and were fearful of clearing them up, lest their goods and their bodies might be demanded in expiation. Here in former <pb id="P.33" n="33"> years stood the  <Q>Mint</Q>  and the  <Q>Clink;</Q>  and here in the present day (<datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>) stands the privileged King's Bench, within whose  <Q>Rules' are congregated the same vicious and demoralised class of people that always inhabited it. </Q> Stews' also still abound, and penny theatres, where the performers are indeed  <Q>vagabonds,</Q>  and the audience thieves.</QUOTE> Thus wrote Charles Mackay, in his agreeable work, <QUOTE>The Thames and its Tributaries,</QUOTE> as lately as <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>.   Things, however, have much improved since that day; at all events, we may hope that such has been the case. 
   <P>In Deadman's Place, on the south-west side of the Borough market, were almshouses for <num value="16">sixteen</num> poor persons, which were founded in <datestruct value="1584--"><year reg="1584">1584</year></datestruct>, by Thomas Cure, and called Cure's College. Thomas Cure was saddler to Edward VI., Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth, and was also member of Parliament for the borough of Southwark. 
   <P>Another cluster of almshouses close by, in Soap Yard, were built and endowed by the retired actor, Edward Alleyn, of whom we shall have more to say when we come to Dulwich College. Alleyn's almshouses have been rebuilt at Norwood. Alleyn directed by his will (<datestruct value="1626--"><year reg="1626">1626</year></datestruct>) that his executors should within <num value="2">two</num> years of his death erect <num value="10">ten</num> almshouses in this parish for <num value="5">five</num> poor men and <num value="5">five</num> poor women, who should be drafted hence, as vacancies occurred, into his college at Dulwich. The almshouses were accordingly <QUOTE>built on part of an enclosure called the Soap Yard belonging to the College of the Poor.</QUOTE> The College of the Poor was founded by letters patent of Queen Elizabeth in <datestruct value="1584--"><year reg="1584">1584</year></datestruct>, and was largely endowed. It provided a home and sustenance for <num value="16">sixteen</num> poor persons, <num value="1">one</num> of whom was to act as warden and read prayers

 daily.   In <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct> Henry Jackson founded   almshouses in Southwark for <num value="2">two</num> women, with <measure value="20d." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pence</measure> a week each; and sundry others of a like nature were founded in different parts of the parish. St. Saviour's is, in fact, particularly rich in benefactions.   According to the <QUOTE>Account of Public Charities in England and Wales,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, it would appear that the annual income of the various charities of this parish amounted to nearly <measure value="2700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2700">2,700</num></measure>. 
    <P>Between St. Saviour's Church and Southwark  Bridge Road, with its principal entrance in Park  Street, is the renowned brewery of Messrs. Barclay and Perkins.   Southwark held a reputation for strong ale from very early times.   We have met somewhere with an old couplet- 
            <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>The nappy strong ale of Southwirke 
              <L>Keeps many a gossip from the kirke.</QUOTE>
 Chaucer's host at the Old Tabard drank it, doubtless; and so did the Knight and the Franklin, and perhaps the   mincing <QUOTE>Nonne</QUOTE> herself.   That there were breweries here as far back as the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century we have reason to know, for  Chaucer speaks of <QUOTE>the ale of Southwark</QUOTE> in his time; and readers of that poet will not have forgotten, among the inhabitants of this part- 
           <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>The miller that for dronken was all pale, 
             <L>So that unethes upon his hors he sat.</QUOTE>

    <P> <QUOTE>Foreigners are not a little amazed,</QUOTE> writes  Boswell, in his <QUOTE>Life of Johnson,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>when they hear of brewers, distillers, and men in similar departments of trade, held forth as persons of considerable consequence. In this great commercial country it is natural that a situation which produces much wealth should be considered as very respectable; and no doubt honesty is entitled to esteem.</QUOTE> Brewing is <num value="1">one</num> of the oldest objects of industry among us; and in early ages the quantity of ale consumed was somewhat larger than is the case now, in proportion to the population and wealth of the nation.   Little is known of the trading practices of the early brewers; but the process, so far as the malting and brewing is concerned, is, doubtless, essentially the same now as it was <num value="3">three</num> centuries ago, when hops were imported into this country from Flanders. By a liberal attention to the improvements of the age, Messrs. Barclay and  Perkins have placed their large establishment in its present eminence among the breweries of the world. <QUOTE>Formerly,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Brayley, in his <QUOTE>History of Surrey,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>our great porter brewers left ale to minor establishments: this is now partially but not entirely changed; <num value="2">two</num> coppers at  Barclay and Perkins' are therefore applied, as the occasion requires, to ale-brewing.   On the other <pb id="P.34" n="34"> hand, some of the less extensive establishments, in former times only occupied with ale, now produce porter also. The difference of the <num value="2">two</num> consists of modifications in the process, and of certain additions for the purpose of flavouring or colouring. The malt and hops are the same, but a very small portion of malt, when burnt black, suffices to colour porter and stout. These liquors are more luscious than ale, and less vinous from undergoing a less perfect fermentation, that process being considerably shortened, usually to <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3">third</num> of the time allowed for ale.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Before proceeding to describe the brewery in its various details, it will be as well, perhaps, to speak of the firm to which it belongs. As early as the middle of the last century, or a <num value="100">hundred</num> years or so after the <QUOTE>Globe</QUOTE> Theatre had passed away, there stood upon this site a small brewery, owned by a certain Mr. Edmund Halsey, whose daughter had married the Lord Cobham   of that time. Having made a fortune out of the establishment, Mr. Halsey sold the brewery to the elder Mr. Thrale, who eventually became member of Parliament for Southwark, and being a landowner at Streatham, served as high sheriff of Surrey. Dr. Johnson used to give the following account of the rise of this gentleman:-- <QUOTE>He worked at <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">six</num> shillings</measure> a week for <num value="20">twenty</num> years in the great brewery, which afterwards was his own.   The proprietor of it had an only daughter, who was married to a nobleman.   It was not fit that a peer should continue the business. On the old man's death, therefore, the brewery was to be sold. To find a purchaser for so large a property was a difficult matter; and after some time it was suggested that it would be advisable to treat with Thrale, a sensible, active, honest man, who had been employed in the house, and to transfer the whole to him for <measure value="30000l." type=currency><num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> pounds</measure>, security being taken upon the property. This was accordingly settled.   In <num value="11">eleven</num> years Thrale paid the purchase-money.</QUOTE> On his death, in <datestruct value="1758--"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>, his son, Mr. Henry Thrale, succeeded him, and found the brewery so profitable a concern, that, although he had been educated to other tastes and habits, he determined not to part with it. This Mr. Thrale was a handsome man of fashion, and was wedded to a pretty and clever girl, Miss Hester Lynch Salusbury, of good Welsh extraction, and, as Boswell informs us, <QUOTE>a lady of lively talents, improved by education.</QUOTE> The lady, we may add, was short, plump, and brisk.   She has herself given us a lively view of the idea which Dr. Johnson had of her person, on her appearing before him in a dark-coloured gown: <QUOTE>You little creatures should never wear those sort of clothes; they are unsuitable in every way. What! have not all insects gay colours?</QUOTE> <LEMMA id="lemma.34.1">Mrs. Thrale</LEMMA>
was destined, nevertheless, as the mistress of 
<LEMMA id="lemma.34.2">Streatham Villa</LEMMA>, the friend of Johnson, and the wife of Piozzi, to   become a shining light in English literature. Boswell tells us, in his <QUOTE>Life of Johnson,</QUOTE> that the great doctor's introduction into Mr. Thrale's family, which contributed so much to the happiness of his life, was owing to her desire for his conversation, is very probable and the general supposition; <QUOTE>but;</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>it is not the truth. Mr. Murphy,</QUOTE> Boswell continues, <QUOTE>who was intimate with Mr. Thrale, having spoken very highly of Dr. Johnson, he was requested to make them acquainted. This being mentioned to Johnson, he accepted of an invitation to dinner at Thrale's, and was so much pleased with his reception, both by Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, and they so much pleased with him, that his invitations to their house were more and more frequent, till at last he became <num value="1">one</num> of the family, and an apartment was appropriated to him, both in their house at Southwark, and in their villa at Streatham.</QUOTE> 
    <P> <QUOTE>The <num value="1">first</num> time,</QUOTE> says Mrs. Piozzi, <QUOTE>I ever saw this extraordinary man was in the year <datestruct value="1764"><year reg="1764">1764</year></datestruct>, when Mr. Murphy, who had long been the friend and confidential intimate of Mr. Thrale, persuaded him to wish for Johnson's conversation, extolling it in terms which that of no other person could have deserved, till we were only in doubt how to obtain his company, and find an excuse for the invitation.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Dr. Johnson had a very sincere esteem for Mr. Thrale, as a man of excellent principles, a good scholar, well skilled in trade, of a sound understanding, and of manners such as presented the character of a plain independent English squire. <QUOTE>I know no man,</QUOTE> said he, <QUOTE>who is more master of his wife and family than Thrale. If he but holds up a finger, he is obeyed. It is a great mistake to suppose that she is above him in literary attainments.   She is more flippant, but he has <num value="10">ten</num> times her learning: he is a regular scholar, but her learning is that of a schoolboy in <num value="1">one</num> of the lower forms.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Thrale, it has been stated, married Miss Salusbury <QUOTE>because she was the only pretty girl of his acquaintance who would consent to live in Southwark; and having married   her, proceeded   to enjoy himself with ladies of doubtful reputation at the theatres, leaving his gay wife to do the honours at Streatham to old Sam, Fanny Burney, and others of the set, not forgetting charming, learned Sophy Streatfield, the mysterous S. S., who won not only <pb id="P.35" n="35"> Thrale's heart, but those of right reverend bishops and grave schoolmasters, by her beauty, ready tears, soft caresses, and fluent Greek and Hebrew. But the time came when Thrale's gay career was suddenly stopped. The bailiffs and the auctioneer invaded the Southwark brewery; but his clever wife begged and borrowed till she bought it in.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Mr. Thrale resided in a house adjoining the brewery, and here he entertained his friends as well as at his country seat at Streatham. For some reason or other he appears to have been unpopular with the mob, for Boswell tells us that in the Gordon Riots his house and stock were in great danger: <QUOTE>The mob was pacified at their <num value="1">first</num> invasion with about <num value="50">50</num> in drink and meat; at the <num value="2">second</num> they were driven away by the soldiers.</QUOTE> It will be remembered that Dr. Johnson helped Mr. Thrale in his contests for the representation of Southwark, writing for him advertisements, letters, and addresses; <num value="1">one</num> of these, dated <datestruct VALUE="1780-09-5"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=5>5</day>, <year reg=1780>1780</year></datestruct>, is preserved by Boswell. 
    <P>After Mr. Thrale's death, in <datestruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct>, the brewery was put up for sale by auction, and Johnson, of course, was present as <num value="1">one</num> of the executors. Lord  Lucan (writes Boswell) tells a very good story, which, if not precisely exact, is at least characteristic--that while the sale was going on, Johnson appeared bustling about, with an ink-horn and a pen in his button-hole, like an exciseman; and on being asked what he considered to be the value of the property which was to be disposed of, answered, <QUOTE>Sir, we are not here to sell a parcel of boilers and vats, but the potentiality of growing rich beyond the dreams of avarice.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The brewery was bought by Mr. David Barclay, junior, then the head of the banking firm   of  Barclay and Co., for the sum of <measure value="135000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="135000">135,000</num></measure>. This gentleman placed in the brewing firm his nephew, from America, Mr. Robert Barclay, who afterwards settled at Bury Hill, and Mr. Perkins, who had been in   Thrale's establishment as manager or superintendent; so that while Mr. Barclay brought the money to carry on the business, Mr. Perkins may be said to have contributed the <QUOTE>brains</QUOTE> hence the firm of <QUOTE>Barclay and Perkins.</QUOTE> 
    <P>So far and so wide are the joint names of Barclay and Perkins known upon the sign-boards of wayside inns, in London and the country, that Mr. G.  A. Sala, in his <QUOTE>Gaslight and Daylight,</QUOTE> suggests that <QUOTE>a future generation may be in danger of assuming that Messrs. Barclay and Perkins were names possessed in an astonishing degree by  London citizens, who, proud of belonging to such respectable families, were in the habit of blazoning the declaration of their lineage in blue and gold on oblong boards, and affixing the same to the fronts of their houses!</QUOTE> 
   <P>But we have not yet quite done with the beautiful Mrs. Thrale. After the death of her <num value="1">first</num> husband, as we have already intimated, she became-contrary to the wishes and advice of Dr. Johnson--the wife of a Mr. Piozzi, and spent much of her time in her charming abode at Streatham, in the enjoyment of a select circle of literary acquaintances.   Rogers was very intimate with the Piozzis, and often visited them at Streatham. He says, <QUOTE>The world</QUOTE> (in which Dr. Johnson was, of course, included) <QUOTE>was most unjust in blaming Mrs. Thrale for marrying Piozzi; he was a very handsome, gentlemanly, and amiable person, and made her a very good husband. In the evening he used to play to us most beautifully on the piano.   Mrs. Piozzi's daughters would never see her after that marriage; and, poor woman, when she was of a very great age, I have heard her say that she would go down on her knees to them   if they only would be reconciled to her.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Tom   Moore, who breakfasted with her after she was turned <num value="80">eighty</num>, speaks of her as still a <QUOTE>wonderful old lady,</QUOTE> with all the quickness and intelligence of a gay young woman: <QUOTE>faces of other times seemed to crowd over her as she sat--the Johnsons, Reynoldses, &amp;c.</QUOTE> Madame  D&lsquo;Arblay speaks of her as <QUOTE>a wonderful character for talents and   eccentricity, for wit, genius, generosity, spirit, and powers of entertainment.</QUOTE> Miss Seward said that <QUOTE>her conversation was that bright wine of the intellect which has no lees;</QUOTE> and even Dr. Johnson, who did not think very highly of the female sex, owned that <QUOTE>her colloquial wit was a fountain of perpetual flow.</QUOTE> Indeed, he used to dwell on her praises with a peculiar delight and a paternal fondness, which showed that he was quite proud and vain of being so intimately acquainted with her. Macaulay commends her as <QUOTE><num value="1">one</num> of those clever, kind-hearted, engaging, vain, pert young women, who are perpetually saying or doing something that is not exactly right; but who, do or say what they may, are always agreeable.</QUOTE> Add to this the words of Sir Nathaniel Wraxall: <QUOTE>She was the provider and conductor of Dr.  Johnson, who lived almost constantly under her roof, or more properly under that of Mr. Thrale both in London and at Streatham. He did not, however, spare her any more than other women in his attacks if she courted and provoked his animadversions.</QUOTE> She was also a butt of the satirists; thus Gifford writes : 
       <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>See Thrale's gay widow with a satchel roam, 
          <L>And bring in pomp laborious nothing home.</QUOTE>
 <pb id="P.36" n="36"> And Dr. Wolcot (Peter Pindar), even more maliciously :-- 
        <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>For that Piozzi's wife, Sir John, exhort her 
          <L>To draw her immortality from porter; 
          <L>Give up her anecdotical inditing, 
          <L>And study housewif'ry instead of writing.</QUOTE>
 
   <P>Mrs. Thrale left <num value="3">three</num> daughters. <num value="1">One</num> of them was a Mrs. Mostyn; her collection of curiosities and relics of Mr. Thrale and Dr. Johnson was sold at Silwood Lodge, Brighton, in the autumn of <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>, soon after Mrs. Mostyn's death. 
   <P>The brewery of Messrs. Barclay and Perkins, <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest establishments of the kind in the world, occupies some <num value="13">thirteen</num> or <num value="14">fourteen</num> acres of ground; the present building dates its erection from <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>, the old brewery having been in that 
<FIGURE id="Fig.036" n="2000.14.0016"><HEAD>Mrs. Thrale.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 year burnt to the ground, with the exception of a very small portion ot the walls. As it is <num value="1">one</num> of the <QUOTE>sights</QUOTE> of the metropolis, and indeed of Europe, our readers may be interested with a somewhat detailed account of the establishment, and of the various processes of malting, brewing, &amp;c., as here carried on. To begin at the beginning, then, we will commence with a description of the process of malting, the object of which is-by forced vegetation of the grain, and then checking that tendency, by gradually and slowly increasing heat from <num value="130">130</num> to <num value="160">160</num> degrees--to separate the particles of starch, and render the saccharine matter formed easily soluble in hot water. For this purpose, the barley is steeped for about <num value="2">two</num> days, in which time it imbibes nearly half its weight of water. It nest <pb id="P.37" n="37"> lies, a few inches deep, on a floor for a fortnight, during which time it is repeatedly stirred to prevent its heating. When the grain is sprouted, its roots extending about half an inch in length, it is kilndried on an iron floor heated by coke, gradually and slowly, commencing at <num value="90">90</num> degrees, and not exceeding at last <num value="160">160</num> degrees, an operation of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> days; after this the sprouts are separated by sifting from the malt, which is then fit for the brewer or distiller. In describing the process of brewing, the author above quoted says: <QUOTE>The brewer, having <num value="1">first</num> ground the malt, mixes it with as much hot water as it will imbibe, stirring the mixture until it is perfectly and equally soaked; the heat of the water must be some degrees below the boiling-point, or it will cake the meal. When well stirred, or mashed, it is covered up from external air for about <num value="3">three</num> hours; then the liquor is drawn off, and boiled for an hour or more with a due proportion of hops (hop blossom), say a pound to the bushel. As all the saccharine matter is not by this <num value="1">first</num> mashing extracted, a <num value="2">second</num>, and even a <num value="3">third</num>, is had recourse to, requiring, however, less time, and allowing hotter water than the <num value="1">first</num>. When the liquor, or wort, as it is called, is drawn 
<FIGURE id="Fig.037" n="2000.14.0017"><HEAD>Barclay's Brewery, <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 from   the copper duly boiled, the hop dregs are strained off, and the wort must be cooled as fast as possible, otherwise the disposition of the beer to turn sour will be much greater; even a larger proportion of hop will hardly save it. When the wort is quite cool it is to be fermented.   Wine from grapes will ferment of itself, but beer requires yeast, or barm, from a previous brewing. This is usually added gradually as the wort appears to require it, and in various proportions, according to the intention of the brewer, whether he wishes to save time in the operations, and to produce a full luscious beverage for early use, or a more vinous and clear liquor of great strength for long preservation. Such are the simple objects of brewing; but a variety of circumstances in the practice requires great care and experience, and not a little acuteness of perception. Even with all these qualifications, the effects of weather used often to be highly injurious, and are so still to persons who brew in a small way without the improvements lately acquired from science. These are so great that with them brewing is carried on indifferently in hot or cold weather, throughout the year, and not as formerly, in March and October chiefly.      The <pb id="P.38" n="38"> principal improvements are in the formation of mashing-tuns or rakes, whereby the malt is mashed in an exceedingly small space of time, and without exposure to the atmosphere, so that all is equally soaked; boilers that afford the most speedy and controllable supply of hot water at the least expense of fuel, an arrangement for drawing off the wort and passing it through iron pipes laid in cold water many hundreds or thousands of yards in continuity, so that the wort is cooled in an incredible short time, and other modes of effecting the same purpose by quick evaporation in metallic shallow vessels.   The fermentation is, on the contrary, carried on in wooden vessels of very great depth, perhaps of <num value="30">thirty</num> feet; whilst a perfect control is maintained that enables the superintendent to promote the generation of carbonic acid gas, or to draw it off, as the case may require.</QUOTE> 
   <P>At the brewery of Messrs. Barclay and Perkins all these operations are to be seen in the utmost perfection, and on the most magnificent scale. The brewhouse, or mashing stage, is <num value="225">225</num> feet long, by <num value="60">60</num> feet in width, and very lofty, with an ingenious and elaborate iron roof. Within this large space are <num value="5">five</num> complete sets of brewing apparatus, perfectly distinct in themselves, but directly connected with the great supply of malt from the floor above, of water-cisterns from below, and of motive force from the steam-engine behind, as well as the vast coolers, fermenting vats, &amp;c.   Each of the copper boilers cost nearly &pound;,<num value="5000">5,000</num> (about <measure value="24000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="24000">24,000</num></measure> altogether); each consists of a furnace, a globular copper that holds <num value="350">350</num> barrels, a pan or covering boiler that contains <num value="280">280</num> barrels, and a cylindrical cistern that will contain <num value="120">120</num> barrels, on arrangements equally beautiful and useful, from its compactness and the economy of heat.   The hot water is drawn from <num value="1">one</num> of these copper boilers to the corresponding mash-tun underneath, which measures about <num value="20">twenty</num> feet in diameter, and holds <num value="150">150</num> quarters of malt. It is supplied with machinery that works from   a centre on a cog-rail which extends over the circumference of the tun, and stirs the malt. The mash-tun has a false bottom, which in due time lets off the <QUOTE>wort</QUOTE> through small holes to an under-back, whence it is pumped back to the emptied copper, from which it received the hot water, and there mixed with hops, to be boiled, and again run off into a cistern <num value="30">thirty</num> feet each way, where, passing through a perforated bottom, it leaves the hops, and is pumped through the cooling tubes, or refrigerator, into an open cooler, and thence to the fermenting squares, which are coffers about <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> feet deep, and <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet square, in which the fermentation by yeast is carried on for some days; from these it is drawn off into pontoons, where the fermentation acquires a fresh activity for a few days longer, when it gradually ceases, and the liquor becomes clearer: it is then put into the large vat, where it remains till required for use.   The vats at Barclay and Perkins' establishment are nearly <num value="200">200</num> in number, the smallest containing <num value="600">600</num> barrels of beer, and the largest <num value="3300">3,300</num> barrels, measuring <num value="36">36</num> feet in diameter at top, <num value="40">40</num> feet at the bottom (or <num value="125">125</num> feet in circumference), and <num value="40">40</num> feet in height. Altogether, they must hold more than <num value="150000">150,000</num> barrels; and the number of casks (butts or barrels), many of them filled, amount to something over <num value="64000">64,000</num>. 
   <P>We have stated that the brewery contains <num value="5">five</num> magnificent boilers with corresponding mash-tuns, and every adjunct. So far the arrangement and explanation are simple enough, and so is, to the eye of an experienced engineer, the machinery that connects and keeps in motion every part of these stupendous operations. It is otherwise to persons unaccustomed to the variety and multiplicity of cog-wheels working at different angles, which communicate action in different and opposite directions from <num value="1">one</num> end of the premises to the other, in what may be denominated a maze of systematic order. The malt is conveyed from <num value="1">one</num> building to another, even across a street, entirely by machinery, and again to the crushing rollers and mash-tun; the cold and the hot water, and the wort and the beer, are pumped in various directions, almost to the exclusion of human exertions, nearly every portion of the heavy toil being accomplished by the steam-engine.   Of all the combinations, none is more complete than what is called the <QUOTE>Jacob's ladder:</QUOTE> this consists of an endless chain working on <num value="2">two</num> rollers at a considerable distance from   each other.   Along this chain buckets are fastened close to each other; these buckets dipping into a heap of malt near <num value="1">one</num> extremity of the chain, carry it on to the other end, where, revolving on the other roller, they are capsized, and thus emptied; they, of course, return to the <num value="1">first</num> roller, where a <num value="2">second</num> inversion places them   again in the position required for filling by their own progress through the heap of malt to be removed. There are no less than <num value="24">twenty-four</num> lofts, each capable of containing <num value="1000">1,000</num> quarters of malt. The <QUOTE>Jacob's ladders</QUOTE> and the refrigerators are among the greatest improvements achieved: the <num value="1">one</num> saves immense labour, simplifies and perfects the work, and, of course, reduces the expenses, and concentrates the operations; the other economises time, and improves the beverage. More space and more hands can be applied to those portions of the <pb id="P.39" n="39"> business that require them; and hence a remarkable degree of method, neatness, cleanliness, and quiet are observable throughout the establishment. 
    <P>The portions of the brewery which we have described above lie on either side of Park Street, being connected by a bridge, which is reached from the upper storeys. On leaving these parts of the establishment, we pass through the engineroom, on the ground-floor, and emerging into the yard, notice the well from which the great supply of water is drawn for consumption in the brewery. In connection with this well, we may state a curious geological fact. This brewery, as we have shown above, is situated near the south bank of the Thames; that of the City of London Brewery Company is in Thames Street, on the opposite side of the river. It is not a little singular that when the pump of the well at Messrs. Barclay's is worked, the level of the water in the well of the City brewery is visibly affected, thus proving that the watery stratum passes clean under the Thames, just as it would under dry land, without being in any way connected with the water of the river. 
   <P>The long ranges of building on the north side of the brewery are used as the carpenters' shops, the cooperage, &amp;c.   In the former a very large amount of work is done in connection with fittings for the various public-houses belonging to the firm, besides other work which may be required in the brewery. On the south side of the yard is another range of buildings, separated from the other by an avenue, over which a large pipe crosses to convey the beer from the <QUOTE>rounds</QUOTE> --as the huge tanks which contained it are called--to the store-vats. These vats are contained in a series of store-rooms, apparently almost interminable.   Long galleries, branching off north, south, east, and west, are crammed as full of vats as the circular form of the vessels will permit, some larger than others, but all, nevertheless, of gigantic proportions.   Some idea may be formed of the extent of the vatgalleries when we state that there are nearly zoo vats, the average capacity of which, large and small together, is upwards of <num value="30000">30,000</num> gallons. <num value="2">Two</num> of the vats are each capable of containing <num value="3500">3,500</num> barrels of <num value="36">thirty-six</num> gallons each, and the weight, when full of porter, is stated to be about <num value="500">500</num> tons. By the aid of a guide we ascend <num value="1">one</num> of the steep ladders, and mounting to the top, obtain a kind of bird's-eye view of these mighty monsters, and then emerging through a small doorway in the roof, obtain a good view not only of the whole range of buildings forming the brewery, but also of St. Saviour's Church and other places round about. The store-rooms in front of us, as we look down on the north side, we were informed, had gradually and completely enclosed a small graveyard, which has at last been partially built upon, and all traces of its previous uses swept away, As this grave-yard does not appear to have been parochial, or attached to any church, it was, in all probability, the same as that which we have mentioned above as having been formerly used as the burial-place of the unfortunate victims of the plague in Bankside.   On the south side of the brewery is an extensive range of stabling, spacious enough to afford proper accommodation for <num value="200">200</num> dray-horses. 
    <P>Messrs. Barclay and Perkins, down to a comparatively recent period, stood quite at the head of the principal porter and ale brewers of London; but latterly Messrs. Hanbury and Co. seem to have taken the lead. Nevertheless, a very large business is done annually by Messrs. Barclay and Perkins, not only in the way of home consumption, but also for shipment abroad, and the average quantity of malt consumed by them   amounts to about <num value="130000">130,000</num> quarters annually, or about <num value="650">650</num> quarters every working day throughout the year, besides a proportionably large quantity of hops.   The brewery is a great attraction for visitors to London, and more especially foreigners, and the <QUOTE>visitors' book</QUOTE> will be found to contain the names of many eminent personages.   <num value="1">One</num> of the bestremembered visitors, perhaps, is Marshal Haynau, who was speedily and unceremoniously ejected by the draymen some years ago, in consequence of his alleged ill-treatment of Polish or Hungarian women, which had come to the knowledge of Messrs. Barclay'and Perkins' draymen. 
   <P>Marshal Haynau, during the sanguinary war in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct> against the Hungarians, had gained considerable notoriety from his excessive cruelty towards the Magyars, particularly the women. The following year, having fallen into disgrace with the Imperial Court of Vienna, and losing his military command, he occupied himself in a tour through Europe, visiting London in due course. On the <datestruct VALUE="1850-09-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>, he paid a visit to Barclay's brewhouse, and   complied with the customary practice of signing the visitors' book on entering the brewery. In less than <num value="2">two</num> minutes the word was passed throughout the establishment that the notorious Hungarian woman-flogger was then in the building.   A number of the men quickly gathered round him as he was viewing the large vat, and commenced showing signs of hostility. Finding that his presence was so decidedly objectionable, the marshal was about to retire, but this he was not permitted to do without receiving <pb id="P.40" n="40"> some marks of violence from the draymen and workmen employed in the brewery.   A truss of straw was dropped on his head as he was passing through the stables, his hat was then beaten over his eyes, his clothes torn off his back, and he was almost dragged along by his beard and moustaches, which were of enormous length.   Some of the carters employed in the brewery and labourers from the Borough Market commenced lashing him with their whips, accompanied with the cry, <QUOTE>Down with the Austrian butcher!</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Give it him!</QUOTE> Both himself and his <num value="2">two</num> companions endeavoured to defend themselves against the mob of workmen, now swelled to upwards of <num value="500">500</num>. In his attempts to escape from his pursuers he rushed along Bankside, and entered the <QUOTE>George</QUOTE> public-house, close by, followed by the throng.   Several rooms were entered by the mob, but in vain.   At last the marshal was discovered crouching in a dust-bin attached to the house. In the meantime the police having been sent for, appeared on the scene, and with some difficulty the crowd was dispersed and the marshal conveyed through a back-door to a police galley which happened to be near at hand. He was then rowed to Waterloo Bridge, and conveyed to Morley's Hotel. 
    <P> <QUOTE>We have often,</QUOTE> writes Charles Knight, <QUOTE>had occasion to sigh over the poverty of London in the article of genuine popular legends; <num value="1">one</num> brewhouse is among the exception.   The names of Henry Thrale and Dr. Samuel Johnson must go down to posterity together. The workmen at Barclay and Perkins's will show you a little apartment in which, according to the tradition of the place, Johnson wrote his dictionary. Now this story,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>has <num value="1">one</num> feature of a genuine legend-it sets chronology at defiance.</QUOTE> He might have added that it sets at defiance topography also; for it is well known that the dictionary was compiled, as shown by us in our <num value="1">first</num> volume,<NOTE>See Vol. I., p. <num value="112">112</num>.</NOTE> in the neighbourhood of Fleet Street. 
   <P>The site of the Globe Theatre, of which we shall speak in the following chapter, is believed to be covered by part of the premises of Messrs. Barclay and Perkins' brewery, at a short distance from the spot on which once stood the town-house of Mr. Thrale. 
   <P>Deadman's Place, according to tradition, took its name from the number of dead interred there in the great plague, soon after the Restoration. Elmes, in his <QUOTE>Topographical Dictionary,</QUOTE> says it is the <num value="2">second</num> turning on the left in Park Street, going from the Borough Market; as shown above, it has now   become partly absorbed in Messrs. Barclay and Perkins' brewery. Pike tells us that little more than <num value="50">fifty</num> years ago there existed in Southwark Park a burial-ground in which many of the Nonconformist worthies were interred.   This cemetery was called Deadman's Place, and was situated not far from New Park Street Chapel. 
    <P>Not far from the brewery, in Park Street, there stood formerly a timber edifice, where Mr. Wadsworth's congregation was accustomed to assemble, and where Richard Baxter was wont occasionally to preach. <QUOTE>Just when I was kept out of Swallow Street,</QUOTE> says Baxter, <QUOTE>his [Mr. Wadsworth's] flock invited me to Southwark, where, though I refused to be their pastor, I preached many months in peace, there being no justice willing to disturb us.</QUOTE> Baxter died in the Charterhouse in <datestruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>At a short distance westward, in Zoar Street, an obscure part of the Borough, close by Gravel Lane, which forms the western boundary of Southwark, there is, or, at all events, there was till very lately, an old Dissenting meeting-house, but now converted into a carpenter's shop, which tradition affirms to have been used by John Bunyan for religious worship. <QUOTE>It is known,</QUOTE> says Mr. R. Chambers, in his <QUOTE>Book of Days</QUOTE> (vol. ii., p. <num value="290">290</num>), <QUOTE>to have been erected a short while before the Revolution, by a few earnest Protestants, as a means of counteracting a Catholic school which had been established in the neighbourhood under the auspices of James II.   But Bunyan may have preached in it once or twice, or even occasionally during the year preceding his death in <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> <num value="1">One</num> of its ministers was John Chester, the ejected minister of Wetherby, in Leicestershire. When Bunyan preached in this chapel, thousands of people were attracted by the charm of his magic eloquence.   It mattered not whether the service was held on the Sunday, or <QUOTE>a morning lecture by <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock on a working-day in the dark winter-time.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1740--"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct> this congregation removed to Deadman's Place, and about <num value="50">fifty</num> years later they migrated to Union Street.   The old chapel in Zoar Street was subsequently used by the Wesleyans, and at last became a brewery and a factory.   A view of the chapel, as it appeared in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, has been engraved for the standard edition of Bunyan's works; and another view of the edifice, as it was in <datestruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct>, will be found in the <QUOTE>Book of Days,</QUOTE> at the page quoted above. 
   <P>It was in Bankside at <num value="1">one</num> time that poor Oliver Goldsmith was practising medicine on his own account, though without much success. This was in the interval after he had been engaged as an assistant ;n a chemist's shop near Fish Street Hill, <pb id="P.41" n="41"> and before he became a schoolmaster at Peckham. Goldsmith's strong passion for dress, at this period of his checkered career, we are told, exhibited itself in a <num value="2">second</num>-hand suit of green and gold, which made him a rather conspicuous personage in the thoroughfares of the Borough; while a want of neatness, and of money to pay the washerwoman, was clearly betrayed in his shirt and neckcloth, often of a fortnight's wear. But contentment or pride provided a covering for his poverty, and he told a friend that <QUOTE>he was practising physic, and doing very well.</QUOTE> The green suit was afterwards changed for a black <num value="1">one</num>, with a patch on the left breast, which he ingeniously concealed by holding up his cocked hat when he was conversing with his patients. A polite person once endeavoured to relieve him from this apparent incumbrance, <QUOTE>which only made him press it more devoutly to his heart.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Bankside is described in the <QUOTE>New View of London,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, as lying <QUOTE>between Upper Ground Street and St. Saviour's Dock.</QUOTE> The thoroughfare now bearing the name extends from St. Saviour's Church westward nearly to Blackfriars Bridge. Not far from Bankside there was a Crucifix Lane, near Barnaby (now Bermondsey) Street and Parish Street, which, with Cardinal's Hat Court, seem to have been so named as belonging at some distant period to the old religious house of St. Mary Overies. 
    <P>A little to the west of St. Saviour's Church is Stoney Street, which ran down to the water-side, nearly opposite to Dowgate, and probably was the continuation of the Watling Street road. <QUOTE>This,</QUOTE> says Pennant, <QUOTE>is supposed to have been a Roman 
<hi rend=italics>trajectus</hi>, and the ferry from Londinum into the province of Cantium.</QUOTE> Marks of the ancient causeway have been discovered on the London side. Of this the name evinces the origin. The Saxons always gave the name of Street to the Roman roads, and here they gave it the addition of Stoney, from the pavement they found it composed of. 
   <P>Between   Southwark   Bridge   Road and   the southern end of Blackfriars Bridge is Holland Street, which marks the site of the ancient moated manor-house, called Holland's Leaguer, of which we have spoken above. All vestiges of the house have long been swept away. In Holland Street, on the spot where once stood the tide-mill of the old manor of Paris Garden, are the Falcon Glass Works, <num value="1">one</num> of the most important manufactories in Southwark.   It may be mentioned here, in passing, that old Southwark was noted for its artists in glass, who are known to have glazed the windows of King's College Chapel, Cambridge, in the reign of Henry VIII.   The Falcon Works have existed here for more than a century. <QUOTE>Their present importance and excellence,</QUOTE> as we learn from Brayley's <QUOTE>History of Surrey</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE>are mainly due to the taste and exertions of the present proprietor [Mr. Apsley Pellatt], and the employment of skilful hands on materials that science and experience approve.   By these means the most elegant productions of the Continent are advantageously rivalled, and in some respects surpassed. The number of persons employed is from   <num value="100">one hundred</num> to <num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num> in the glasshouse, and about <num value="30">thirty</num> elsewhere.   The weight of glass manufactured in the course of a year, into chandeliers, illuminators for ships or cellars, toilet or smelling-bottles, ornamental glasses of every description for the table, and various objects for medical and philosophical purposes, has been <num value="20000">20,000</num> lbs.</QUOTE> Since the repeal of the excise duty on glass the quantity worked has been very largely increased, and the quality improved. Mr. Apsley Pellatt, who was for some years M.P. for Lambeth, died in <datestruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>Close by the glass works, on the site of the Falcon drawing-dock, was situated the <QUOTE><LEMMA id="lemma.41.1">Falcon Tavern</LEMMA>,</QUOTE> famous for its connection with the name of William Shakespeare.   Here the great <QUOTE>poet of all time</QUOTE> and his companions would refresh themselves after the fatigue of the afternoon performances at the Globe hard by. <QUOTE>It long continued,</QUOTE> says, Mr. Larwood, <QUOTE>to be celebrated as a coaching inn for all parts of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, till it was taken down in <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> The name, as shown above, is still preserved in the Falcon Glass Works, and also in the Falcon Stairs. A house is still standing, or was till lately, which is considered to have been part of the original tavern, and, at all events, occupies its site and immortalises his name. 
    <P>In the rear of the Falcon Glass Works, opening upon Holland Street-or that part of it which was till lately called the <QUOTE>Green Walk</QUOTE> --is a small cluster of almshouses, founded in <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, by a Mr. Hopton, for the purpose of affording shelter for <QUOTE>poor decayed householders of the parish   of Christchurch,</QUOTE> together with a yearly pension of <measure value="12l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="12">12</num></measure> to each inmate. 
    <P>Previous to the erection of Southwark Bridge, in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, Bankside, from   London to Blackfriars Bridges, presented a comparatively uninteresting succession of wharves and warehouses, together with irregular-built dwelling-houses; but upon the formation of the viaduct to the new bridge, extensive improvements were planned on each side, the most important of which was the erection of <pb id="P.42" n="42"> a huge pile of building westward, by the Messrs. Pott, upon a tract of ground which, for upwards of <num value="2">two</num> centuries, has been used for manufacturing purposes.   These   premises   were   occupied   as vinegar-works by a Mr. Rush, so long ago as <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, and continued in his family till <datestruct value="1790"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, when they came into the possession of the Messrs. Pott, whose family had carried on a manufactory of the same kind for <num value="70">seventy</num> years in Mansel Street, Whitechapel.   The ground here, as we have already shown, originally formed a portion of the park of the ancient palace of the Bishops of Winchester. The property, as we have stated, is still held of the see of Winchester, by Messrs. Pott, who, conjointly with the Bishop of Winchester, in <datestruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>-<num value="9">9</num>, gave a portion of the grounds for the site of the new parish church of St. Peter's, and   of the new grammar-school of St. Saviour's. 
   <P>The church and school stand on the north side of Sumner Street-so named after Dr. Sumner, late Bishop of Winchester--which connects Southwark Bridge Road with Park Street.   The church is a neat building, in imitation of the Pointed style, and is constructed of fine light brick, with stone dressings.   At the western end rises an embattled tower, with square turrets at the angles; the eastern gable is surmounted with an enriched cross, turrets, &amp;c.; the principal entrances are at the west end, and at the south side, under an enriched stone headway, beneath the central window. The cost of building was contributed by the trustees of <QUOTE>Hyndman's Bounty;</QUOTE> being a portion of the donation of   <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure> devoted, in fulfilment of the 
<FIGURE id="Fig.042" n="2000.14.0018"><HEAD>Plan Of Bankside, Early In The Seventeenth Century.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 wish of a certain Miss Hyndman, to the erection of churches in populous districts.   A further sum of about <measure value="1700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1700">1,700</num></measure> was raised by subscription, among the parishioners, for the enclosure, decoration, and furniture of the edifice. 
   <P>Since the annexation of Southwark to London, as stated in a previous chapter, its ecclesiastical divisions have gradually been increased by subdivisions.   The <num value="2">two</num> parishes of St. Mary's and St. Margaret's, indeed, as we have already shown, have been united, the old church of St. Saviour's being made to do duty for both; but the parish of Christ Church, as nearly as possible co-extensive with the Manor of Paris Garden, has been formed out of St. Saviour's, as also has the still more modern parish of St. Peter's, of which we have spoken above.   The parish of St. John's, Horselydown, has in like manner been taken out of St. Olave's; and the hospital church of St. Thomas has been   made   parochial.      Of the   churches belonging to the <num value="2">two</num> last-named parishes, and also of Christ Church, Blackfriars Road, we shall speak in due course. 
   <P>St. Saviour's Grammar School, as we have already had occasion to state, stood originally on the south side of St. Saviour's Church; it was founded by Queen Elizabeth in <datestruct value="1562--"><year reg="1562">1562</year></datestruct>, for the use of the parishioners, <QUOTE>poor as well as rich.</QUOTE> It was burnt down a few years after its establishment, but was rebuilt.   In <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct> the school was removed to a more convenient site in Sumner Street, where the present school and schoolhouse were built about the year <datestruct value="1838"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>.   At the same time the statutes <pb id="P.43" n="43"> were revised by the Court of Chancery, and the education now given is that of a public school, while the endowment is sufficient to allow of the charges being reduced to a most moderate scale. The school was reformed in <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct> under a scheme approved by the Court of Chancery, the usual classical and commercial course being prescribed. The visitor is the Bishop of Winchester, under the shadow of whose palace the old school had grown up. By the statutes it is provided that the master shall be <QUOTE>a man of a wise, sociable, loving disposition, not hasty or furious, or of any ill example, but wise and of good   experience to discern the nature of every several child; to work upon the disposition for the greatest advantage, benefit, and comfort of the child, and to learn with the love of his book, if such an <num value="1">one</num> can be got.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The school and   master's house, &amp;c., which nearly adjoins the western   end   of St. Peter's Church, are built of brick, with stone dressings, in the Elizabethan Domestic style, from the designs of Mr. Christopher Edmonds, architect.   By the charter of incorporation, the original endowment amounted to <measure value="40l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40">40</num></measure> per annum; <num value="6">six</num> governors were appointed, who were to be advised in the appointment and government of the master and usher by

 the Bishop of Winchester, <QUOTE>or any other good and learned man.</QUOTE> Immediately after the charter, the governors ordered that the schoolmaster's wages should be     <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> yearly; that children of the parish should be taught free, paying <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> entrance, and <measure value="8d." type=currency><num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> per annum   towards brooms and <hi rend=italics>rods</hi>. The whole number of scholars was not to exceed <num value="100">100</num>; the head-master taking <num value="40">forty</num> for his own advantage; in <datestruct value="1614--"><year reg="1614">1614</year></datestruct> he was allowed a dwellinghouse in the parish, rent-free; and the governors had the discretion of increasing his stipend, and taking children of other parishes and places. In the above year also, John Bingham, <num value="1">one</num> of the governors of the school, founded an endowment for <num value="2">two</num> poor scholars at Cambridge or Oxford- <QUOTE>none but poor and such as were forward in learning, and might be fit for the University.</QUOTE> According to the Parliamentary Report, in <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, the annual income of this school amounted to <measure value="387l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="387">387</num></measure> <measure value="15s. 1d." type=Currency><num value="15">15</num>s. <num value="1">1</num>d.</measure> At that time there were sixtyeight boys upon the foundation; each paid <measure value="1l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1">1</num></measure> entrance, and <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure> a quarter to the writing-school, and the like to the classical school. The above report states, <QUOTE>With the exception   of writing and arithmetic, the education given at the school is, according to the provisions of the charter, <pb id="P.44" n="44"> entirely classical. It appears that this has operated to deter poor persons who might be entitled to send their children there from so doing; but we are assured that no poor child, whose parents have applied for his admission, has been refused.</QUOTE> The average number of children is now about <num value="120">120</num>, and the school is thrown entirely open. There are several valuable scholarships; and the pupils are prepared for the Universities, Civil Service, and other public examinations, combined with a thorough commercial education. 
   <P>To the south of Sumner Street, and connecting the <num value="2">two</num> great thoroughfares of the Borough and Blackfriars Road, is a broad roadway, called Southwark Street. It was formed about the year <datestruct value="1860"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, and its sides are lined with some lofty and handsome warehouses, offices, and other places of business, which present a marked improvement on the ordinary street architecture of old Southwark. In the formation of this street a large number of courts and alleys were swept away, and a great alteration was made in the west side of the High Street, by the removal of the Town Hall, of which we shall presently speak.   The preparations for the erection of Southwark Bridge had cleared away several narrow streets on the Surrey side of the river, and materially altered the appearance of the neighbourhood. Bandyleg Walk, a dirty lane between Maid Lane (now New Park Street) and Queen Street (now Union Street), are on the spot where formerly was a waste piece of ground. The Dyers' Field, with a filthy pond in the centre, became Great Guildford Street; and the name of Union Street was conferred upon the thoroughfare between the end of Charlotte Street and the Borough.   The district between the Blackfriars Road and Bandyleg Walk had an unsavoury reputation in the last century. Gravel Lane, Ewer Street, and the adjacent courts and alleys, were the St. Giles's of Southwark, inhabited by a dense colony of Irish, whose frequent drunken bouts and faction fights were, in those days of the old <QUOTE>Charlies,</QUOTE> sufficiently desperate to warn off steady-going people from the locality. On the north side of the street, westward of Southwark Bridge Road, are some extensive blocks of model lodging-houses, erected by the Peabody trustees. The range of buildings covers a large extent of ground; and the houses themselves, which are constructed of brick, and upon the most improved principles, are several storeys in height. 
   <P>At the eastern end of Southwark Street, near its junction with the High Street, and close by the Borough Market, stands the Hop Exchange, which was built about <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>, from the designs of Mr. Moore.   This is a large and magnificent range of buildings, several storeys in height, in which are offices, &amp;c., used by hop merchants and others, and enclosing a lofty hall, in which the business of the   exchange is carried on.   The hall, which is approached from the street by a short flight of steps, and a vestibule, in which are some handsome iron gates, is surrounded by <num value="3">three</num> galleries, which serve as means of communication to the various offices. In the rear are some extensive warehouses and   stowage for hops, &amp;c. The railings of the galleries are appropriately decorated, and the hall itself is covered in with a glass roof. 
   <P>It has been said of St. Petersburg that more labour is expended in the foundations of the houses than on the houses themselves; and so it is with Southwark Street.   The subway which runs along its centre, as stated in a previous part of this work,<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="239">239</num>.</NOTE> is a piece of building which will last for many generations. Underneath that subway, which is <num value="7">seven</num> feet high in the centre, is the sewer; the gas and water pipes are laid in the subway. There is a communication from   it for gas and water to every house, the repair of the pipes will not necessitate the opening of the streets, and passengers are saved the disagreeable intelligence of <QUOTE>No thoroughfare,</QUOTE> when driving in a cab to catch a train. This subway, indeed, is a most excellent piece of building, and   has been finished in a masterly manner; and the same degree of excellent workmanship may be said to have been bestowed upon the fronts of the houses on either side of the street. Altogether, Southwark Street is more like an old Roman street, especially in its subway, than anything of modern times.   In architecture it may be called Parisian, for the style of the houses is borrowed from that which dominates in Paris, and is identified with the period of Louis XIV. Near the eastern end of the street the roadway is crossed by a railway arch, over which passes the lines connecting London Bridge and Cannon Street Stations with Waterloo and Charing Cross; whilst the other end of the street passes under the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, close by Blackfriars Bridge Station. In the middle of the roadway, at either end of the street, are ornamental shafts, surrounded by lamps, for the ventilation of the subway. 
   <P>Altogether, the Bankside of to-day is a notably different place from the Bankside of theatres and pleasure-gardens as it appeared <num value="2">two</num> centuries agog and which we shall now proceed to describe. <pb id="P.45" n="45">

<P>In the present chapter we must ask our readers to transport themselves along with us, mentally, some <num value="250">250</num> or <num value="300">300</num> years, to the Bankside with which Shakespeare and Burbage, and Ben Jonson, and Beaumont and Fletcher were familiar. They will see no rows of densely-crowded courts and alleys, with their idle and dissolute, gin-drinking inhabitants; but before their eyes there will rise at least <num value="3">three</num> large round structures of singular appearance, not unlike small martello towers, open to the sky above, together with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> plots of enclosed ground scaffolded about for the use of spectators. These are the Paris Gardens, and the Globe, the Hope, and the Swan Theatres. And besides these, there are the stately palaces of the Bishops of Winchester and Rochester, as we have already shown; and all to the south are green fields and hedgerows. 
   <P> <QUOTE>On the southern bank of the Thames,</QUOTE> writes Mr. J. H. Jesse, in his <QUOTE>London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>between Blackfriars Bridge and Southwark Bridge, is <LEMMA id="lemma.45.1">Bankside</LEMMA>. Here was the <LEMMA id="lemma.45.2">Globe Theatre</LEMMA>, immortalised as the spot where Shakespeare trod the stage; here was the celebrated  <Q>Paris Garden;</Q>  here stood the circuses for  <Q>bowll-baytyng</Q>  and  <Q>beare-baytyng,</Q>  where Queen Elizabeth entertained the French ambassadors with the baiting of wild beasts. Here stood the <LEMMA id="lemma.45.3">Falcon Tavern</LEMMA>-the  <Q>Folken Inne</Q>  as it is styled in the ancient plans of Banksidethe daily resort of Shakespeare and his dramatic companions; here, between Southwark Bridge and London Bridge, the site still pointed out by  <Q> Pike Gardens,</Q>  were the pike-ponds, which once supplied our monarchs with fresh-water fish; and, lastly, here were the park and the palace of the Bishop of Winchester.</QUOTE> 
   <P>It will be seen at once, from the above quotation, that the ancient topography of the southern bank of the Thames (or Bankside) between London and Blackfriars Bridges, is peculiarly interesting to the lover of dramatic lore, as well as to the student of the sports and pastimes of our ancestors. Down to the middle of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, and probably much later, with the exception of a few houses extending westward along the bank of the river, and sundry places of amusement, the greater part of the land hereabouts would seem to have been waste and unenclosed. 
   <P>The Globe Theatre, as already mentioned by us, occupied part of the site now covered by Messrs. Barclay and Perkins' Brewery. 
   <P>In the <QUOTE>History of St. Saviour's, Southwark,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, we read that <QUOTE>the passage which led to the Globe Tavern, of which the playhouse formed a part, was, till within these few years, known by the name of Globe Alley, and upon its site now stands a large storehouse for porter.</QUOTE> It was called the Globe from its sign, which was a figure of Hercules, or Atlas, supporting a globe, under which was written, <QUOTE lang=la>Totus mundus agit histrionem</QUOTE> ( <QUOTE>All the world acts a play</QUOTE> ); and not, as many have conjectured, from its circular shape; for the Globe, though a rotunda within, was to the outward view a hexagon. 
   <P>We have no description of the <LEMMA id="lemma.45.4">interior of the Globe</LEMMA>, but that it was somewhat similar to our modern theatres, with an open space in the roof; or perhaps it more resembled an inn-yard, where, in the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign, many of our ancient dramatic pieces were performed. The galleries in both were arranged on <num value="3">three</num> sides of the building; the small rooms under the lowest, answered to our present boxes, and were called rooms; the yard bears a sufficient resemblance to the pit, as at present in use, and where the common people stood to see the exhibition; from which circumstance they are called by Shakespeare <QUOTE>the <hi rend=italics>groundlings</hi>,</QUOTE> and by Ben Jonson <QUOTE>the <hi rend=italics>under-, standing</hi> gentlemen of the <hi rend=italics>ground</hi>.</QUOTE> The stage was erected in the area, with its back to the gateway, where the admission money was generally taken. The price of admission into the best <hi rend=italics>rooms</hi>, or boxes, was in Shakespeare's time a shilling, though afterwards it appears to have risen to <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> and half-a-crown.   The galleries, or scaffolds, as they were sometimes called, and that part of the house which in private theatres was named the pit, seem to have been the same in price, which was sixpence, while in some meaner playhouses it was only a penny, and in others twopence. 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.45.5">Theatre Tickets</LEMMA></NOTE>
 <pb id="P.46" n="46"> 
     <P>The Globe Theatre, according to Mr. Dyce, in his <QUOTE>Life of Shakespeare,</QUOTE> was <num value="1">first</num> opened late in <datestruct value="1594--"><year reg="1594">1594</year></datestruct>, or early in the following year; at all events, within <num value="20">twenty</num> years of the opening of the <num value="1">first</num> theatre in London.      During the summer, the Lord   Chamberlain's <QUOTE>servants,</QUOTE> --of whom   Shakespeare was <num value="1">one</num>-acted at the Globe, returning in the winter to the theatre at Blackfriars, which   was more effectually sheltered   from   the weather.   They also occasionally changed their 
  <hi rend=italics>venue</hi> by playing at the <QUOTE>Curtain,</QUOTE> in Shoreditch, and at the theatre in Newington Butts. 
     <P>No sooner did James I. ascend the throne, than he issued from Greenwich a royal proclamation, authorising, by name, <QUOTE>Our servants, Lawrence   Fletcher, William Shakspeare, Richard Burbage,</QUOTE> &amp;c. &amp;c., <QUOTE>freely to use and exercise the art and faculty of plays, comedies, tragedies, histories, interludes, morals, pastorals, stage-plays, &amp;c. &amp;c., as well within their now usual house, called the   Globe, within our County of Surrey, as also within any town halls . . . or other convenient places within the liberties . . . of any other city, university, town, or borough whatever within our realms.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Shakespeare and   his associates at this time were at the head of the Lord Chamberlain's company, performing at the Globe in the summer; but by virtue of it they ceased to be the Lord  Chamberlain's servants, and became <QUOTE>the king's players.</QUOTE> It may be added that <QUOTE>Mr. Shakespeare, of the Globe,</QUOTE> is mentioned in a letter from Mrs.  Alleyn to her husband, the founder of Dulwich  College. 
    <P>If any doubt exist as to the extent of Shakespeare's connection with the theatres in Bankside, it will be removed by the lines of Ben Jonson, in allusion   to the   fondness for dramatic performances which marked our last Tudor and our <num value="1">first</num> Stuart sovereign :-- 
      <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Sweet Swan of Avon, what a sight it were 
        <L>To see thee in our waters yet appear,

    <P> <QUOTE>It was here,</QUOTE> writes Charles Mackay, in his <QUOTE>Thames and its Tributaries,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>near the spot still called the Bankside, that the Globe Theatre stood at the commencement of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century; the theatre of which Shakespeare himself was in part proprietor, where some of his plays were <num value="1">first</num> produced, and where he himself performed in them.   It was of an octagonal form, partly covered with thatch, as we learn from the account in Stow, who tells us that in <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct>, <num value="10">ten</num> years after it was <num value="1">first</num> licensed to Shakespeare and Burbage, and the rest, the thatch took fire by the negligent discharge of a piece of ordnance, and in a very short time the whole building was consumed. The house was filled with people to witness the representation of <hi rend=italics>King Henry the <num value="8">Eighth</num></hi>; but they all escaped unhurt.   This was the end of Shakespeare's theatre; <LEMMA id="lemma.46.1">it was rebuilt</LEMMA>, however, apparently in a similar style, in the following year.</QUOTE> 
     <P>Theatres in   those times were very different structures from what they are in the present day; they were unroofed, circular or hexagonal edifices, shielded from the rain by a canvas covering, and without scenery or decorations, as well as innocent of <QUOTE>stalls</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>boxes,</QUOTE> for the more aristocratic part of the audience sat upon the stage, among the performers, drinking   beer and   enjoying   a friendly pipe.   The central area   in the public theatres was termed <QUOTE>the yard,</QUOTE> the word <QUOTE>pit</QUOTE> being   restricted   to   private   theatres; the   pits were furnished with seats, which was not the case with   the <QUOTE>yards.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Cressets, or large   open lanterns,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Dyce, <QUOTE>served to illuminate the body of the house; and <num value="2">two</num> ample branches, of a form similar to those now hung in churches, gave light to the stage. The band of musicians, which was far from numerous, sat, it is supposed, in an upper balcony, over what is now called the stage-box; the instruments chiefly used were trumpets, cornets, hautboys, lutes, recorders, viols, and organs.   Nearly all these theatres were of wood; and the public theatres were open to the sky, the luxury of a roof being confined to  <Q>private</Q>  theatres-whatever these may have been.   On the outside of each was a sign indicative of its name; and on the roof a flag was hoisted during the time of performance.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The peculiar construction of the theatre   in Shakespeare's time is referred to by the poet himself, for he thus speaks of the Globe Theatre in the play of <hi rend=italics>Henry V</hi>. ;--

   <P>In these early days of the drama, a curtain occupied the place of scenery, while the scene supposed to be represented was inscribed on a board, and hung up at the back of the stage, such, for instance, as <QUOTE>This is a house,</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>This is a garden.</QUOTE>

    <P>An account of the accident mentioned above is given by Sir Henry Wotton, in a letter dated  <datestruct VALUE="1613-07-2"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=2>2</day>, <year reg=1613>1613</year></datestruct> : <QUOTE>Now to let matters of state sleepe,  I will entertain you at the present with what happened this week at the Banks side.   The  King's players had a new play, called <hi rend=italics>All is True,</hi>
representing some principal pieces of the reign of  Henry VIII., which set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and majesty even to the matting of the stage; the knights of the order with their Georges and Garter, the guards with their embroidered coats, and the like; sufficient in truth within awhile to make greatness very familiar, if not ridiculous. Now King Henry making a masque at the Cardinal Wolsey's house, and certain cannons being shot off at his entry, some of the paper or other stuff, wherewith <num value="1">one</num> of them   was stopped, did light on the thatch, where, being thought at <num value="1">first</num> but idle smoak, and their eyes more attentive to the show, it kindled inwardly, and ran round like a train, consuming within less than an hour the whole house to the very ground.   This was the fatal period of that virtuous fabrick, wherein yet nothing did perish but <hi rend=italics>wood</hi> and <hi rend=italics>straw</hi>, and a few forsaken cloaks; only <num value="1">one</num> man had his breeches set on fire, that would perhaps have broyled him, if he had not, by the benefit of a provident wit, put it out with a bottle of ale.</QUOTE> 
    <P>From   a letter of Mr. John Chamberlaine to Sir Ralph Winwood, dated <datestruct VALUE="1613-07-8"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=8>8</day>, <year reg=1613>1613</year></datestruct>, in which this accident is likewise mentioned, we learn that the theatre had only <num value="2">two</num> doors. <QUOTE>The burning of the Globe or playhouse on the Bankside on St. Peter's day cannot escape you; which fell out by a peal of chambers (that I know not upon what occasion were to be used in the play), the tampin or stopple of <num value="1">one</num> of them lighting in the thatch that covered the house burn'd it down to, the ground in less than <num value="2">two</num> hours, with a dwellinghouse adjoyning; and it was a great marvaile and a fair grace of God that the people had so little harm, having but <hi rend=italics><num value="2">two</num> narrow doors</hi> to get out.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct> was entered in the Stationers' books, 
 <title>A doleful Ballad of the General Conflagration of the famous Theatre called the Globe.</title>

    <P>Taylor, the water poet, commemorates the event in the following lines :-- 
     <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=stanza><L>As gold is better that in fire's tried, 
          <L>So is the Bankside Globe, that late was burn'd 
       <L>For where before it had a thatched hide, 
          <L>Now to a stately theatre &lsquo;tis turn'd; 
       <L>Which is an emblem that great things are won 
          <L>By those that dare through greatest dangers run.</QUOTE>

    <P>It is also alluded to in some verses by Ben  Jonson, entitled <QUOTE>An   Execration upon Vulcan,</QUOTE> from   which it appears that Ben Jonson was in the theatre when it was burnt. 
    <P>The exhibitions given at the Globe appear to have been calculated for the lower class of people, and to have been more frequent than those at the Blackfriars, till early in the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, when it became less fashionable and frequented.   The Globe was immediately contiguous to the Bear Garden; and it is probable, therefore, that those who resorted thither went to the theatre when the bear-baiting sports were over, and such persons were not likely to form a very refined audience. 
    <P>It has often been said that Shakespeare, on his <num value="1">first</num> arrival in London from Stratford-on-Avon, was received into the playhouse in a subordinate position, and associated with company of a mean and low rank; but Mr. Dyce sees reason for believing that <QUOTE>he never was attached to any other company (of players) than that which owned the Blackfriars and the Globe.</QUOTE> Among Shakespeare's fellows at this time were Marlowe, Greene, Lodge, Beaumont, Fletcher, Peele, Chettle, Burbage, and a few others. 
   <P>We have already made some mention of Burbage in our account of Blackfriars Theatre,<NOTE>See Vol. I., p <num value="201">201</num>.</NOTE> but as there is a certain sense in which <QUOTE>Master</QUOTE> James Burbage, carpenter, &amp;c., of the parish of St. Leonard's, Shoreditch, may be regarded as the father of the English stage, some additional notice of him here, in connection with the Globe, may not be altogether out of place.      Although the drama had flourished in the shape, at all events, of miracle-plays and such-like performances in the ages before the Reformation, yet under our Tudor sovereigns the drama was not held in high <pb id="P.48" n="48"> honour, nor was the profession of a dramatist regarded as worthy of respect. Royal and court authority had all along set its face against plays and interludes as dangerous to the morals of the young, and, therefore, things to be forbidden to the citizens of London and   their apprentices. Indeed, all plays were strictly interdicted within the City; and on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, when it became known that a play was to be performed at the <QUOTE>Boar's Head,</QUOTE> in Aldgate, the Lord Mayor received an order from   Queen Mary to stop the performance.   In the early part of Elizabeth's reign it was found that the dramatic element was too strongly mixed up with human nature to be quite suppressed, and that it was better to bear with and hold in check what could not be utterly forbidden. Accordingly, in the year <datestruct value="1575"><year reg="1575">1575</year></datestruct>, when the Lord Mayor had issued an edict altogether inhibiting plays within the circuit of the City, <num value="1">one</num> James Burbage, a carpenter, bethought himself that he would erect a structure of wood, which would serve for a theatre, on a site just beyond the 
<FIGURE id="Fig.048" n="2000.14.0020"><HEAD>Ben Jonson.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 Lord Mayor's jurisdiction.   <num value="2">Two</num> circumstances favoured his idea: firstly, his father-in-law was a man of substance, owning a few houses at Shoreditch; and secondly, in the previous year, just prior to the revels at Kenilworth, Queen Elizabeth had permitted her favourite, the Earl of Leicester, to collect a body of actors, and to enrol them under a patent from the crown. At the head of this body was placed James Burbage. Aided by the help of his father-in-law, he obtained from a neighbour a lease of some land in Shoreditch, with permission from the landlord to build on it a theatre of wood.   He did so forthwith; the play-house was opened; crowds flocked to it, and it was soon known over London as <QUOTE>The Theatre.</QUOTE> Its success was so great that some opposition was soon threatened; but Burbage saw his chance, and built hard by a rival theatre, which he called <QUOTE>The Curtain.</QUOTE> These <num value="2">two</num> buildings became the nursery of the English stage.   In the <num value="1">one</num> Ben Jonson obtained his <num value="1">first</num> engagement as a writer and vamper of plays, and took to the stage for <pb id="P.49" n="49"> a living.   Encouraged by his double success at Shoreditch, James Burbage grew bolder, and soon afterwards erected a <num value="3">third</num> theatre at Blackfriars, under the nose of the Lord Mayor and of the lords and ladies who lived around the Bridewell Palace; and in spite of their remonstrances, he held his own, supported, no doubt, by Leicester's influence. In the year <datestruct value="1576"><year reg="1576">1576</year></datestruct> he opened the Blackfriars Theatre, which soon became the leading playhouse of the metropolis, and which is connected with the name of William Shakespeare. 
   <P>Several other playhouses now sprung up in quick succession-viz., the <QUOTE>Red Bull</QUOTE> and the <QUOTE>Fortune,</QUOTE> in the north of London; and on the south of the river, in Southwark, the <QUOTE>Rose,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Hope,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Swan,</QUOTE> and the <QUOTE>Globe,</QUOTE> near the <QUOTE>Bear Garden.</QUOTE> Driven out of the City, and put to their wits' end for an honest livelihood, the poor players, who now began to style themselves <QUOTE>Her Majesty's Servants,</QUOTE> began to build theatres in all the suburbs; and to James Burbage is due the credit of having enabled them to do so. In fact, until he came forward to assist the poor dramatists by his skill as a carpenter, and, in 
<FIGURE id="Fig.049" n="2000.14.0021"><HEAD>Map of Southwark, <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 some sense, manager too, there was no combined effort at producing a genuine English drama. But from   the moment that Jamos Burbage, like a <num value="2">second</num> Thespis, erected his wooden theatre in Shoreditch, the calling of the player began to assume a definite character, and acting grew into the dignity of an art and a profession. Shakespeare found all these theatres, and others too, in existence when he came to London from Stratford in <datestruct value="1585--"><year reg="1585">1585</year></datestruct> or the following year; and it is quite possible that, if it had not been for James Burbage, he would never have come to the metropolis, or written for us and for all time either <hi rend=italics>Hamlet</hi> or 
<hi rend=italics>Macbeth</hi>, as he would have had no stage on which to perform   them. At all events, when he came to town, and joined the company at the Blackfriars, he became a fast friend of James Burbage and of <LEMMA id="lemma.50.1">his son Richard</LEMMA>, who became the Roscius of his age, and the original actor of most of Shakespeare's principal characters.   The   elder Burbage did not live to see the lease of his <num value="1">first</num> theatre expire, and the building demolished and carried across the river into Southwark by his son Cuthbert. But he saw the Earl of Leicester's <pb id="P.50" n="50"> actors formally established as members of a recognised profession, and able to influence the age in which they lived.   James Burbage died about the year <datestruct value="1594"><year reg="1594">1594</year></datestruct>; his son Richard   survived him   for <num value="20">twenty</num> years, dying <num value="2">two</num> years before his friend   Will Shakespeare.   It may be of interest to add that the whole Burbage family lived and died in   Holywell (now High) Street, Shoreditch, and were buried, along with several other <QUOTE>poor players,</QUOTE> in St. Leonard's churchyard. 
     <P>In <datestruct value="1596--"><year reg="1596">1596</year></datestruct> Shakespeare appears to have lived near the Bear Garden, in Southwark. <QUOTE>I have yet to learn,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Dyce, <QUOTE>that the fancy of Shakespeare could not luxuriate in rural images, even amid the fogs of Southwark and Blackfriars.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Shakespeare does not appear to have sustained any loss by the burning of the Globe Theatre, for he had parted with his interest in theatrical property on retiring to Stratford-on-Avon. His late partners, however, were sufferers to a very considerable extent, and Shakespeare, in all probability, contributed-along with King James and many of the nobility and gentry of the day--to   the rebuilding of the theatre in the course of the following year. 
    <P>As is well known, the line quoted as a motto to   this   chapter was the   motto of the Globe  Theatre; but it may not be known   that this motto was the cause of <num value="2">two</num> couplets of verse, by  Ben Jonson and Shakespeare respectively, quoted by Mr. Dyce from <QUOTE>Poetical Characteristics,</QUOTE> a manuscript formerly in the Harleian   collection.  Ben asks- 
      <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>If but stage-actors all the world displays,

    <P>To this <QUOTE>Gentle Will</QUOTE> replies, with pleasant repartee:-- 
         <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Little or much of what we see we do; 
           <L>We're all both actors and spectators too.</QUOTE>

    <P>Besides the Globe, there were, as stated above, <num value="3">three</num> other theatres on the Bankside, called the 
 <LEMMA id="lemma.50.2"> <QUOTE>Rose,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Hope,</QUOTE> and the <QUOTE>Swan.</QUOTE> </LEMMA>   These appear, for some undiscovered reason, to have been called <QUOTE>private</QUOTE> theatres. <QUOTE>There was this difference between these and the Globe and other public theatres, that the latter were open to the sky, except over the stage and galleries; but the private theatres were completely covered in from the weather. On the roof of all of them, whether public or private, a flag was always hoisted to mark the time of the performances.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The Rose Theatre had the honour of numbering <LEMMA id="lemma.50.3">Ben Jonson</LEMMA>, in his early days, as <num value="1">one</num> of its play-writers. In Henslowe's <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> the manager, under date <datestruct VALUE="1597-07-28"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1597>1597</year></datestruct>, acknowledges the receipt of <measure value="3s. 9d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="9">9</num>d.</measure> as part of <QUOTE>Bengemmens Johnsone's share;</QUOTE> and, from another entry, it would appear that on the same day Henslowe lent him   <measure value="4l." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> pounds</measure>.   Early in the December of the same year, there is an entry of <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure> lent to Jonson upon a book which he was to write for the company before Christmas, the plot having been already shown to its members.   These facts show that he had then gained some standing, though not, perhaps, a very high <num value="1">one</num>, as a dramatic writer. 
      <P>From   the Rose we follow him to the Globe, where we find him for the <num value="1">first</num> time associated with Shakespeare, on whose recommendation the company of that theatre accepted his <num value="1">first</num> very successful hit, <title>Every Man in his  Humour</title>, which drew on him the notice of Queen Elizabeth. 
     <P>Whilst writing for the theatres, Ben Jonson lived on the Bankside, whence he afterwards removed to the house of a wool-comber, just outside Temple   Bar, and close to the <QUOTE>Devil Tavern,</QUOTE> where we have already made his acquaintance.<NOTE>See Vol. I., p. <num value="39">39</num>.</NOTE>

     <P>The Rose Theatre stood at the north end of what was formerly called Rose Alley; it is mentioned by Taylor the <QUOTE>water-poet,</QUOTE> in his <QUOTE>True   Cause of the Waterman's Suit concerning Players,</QUOTE> <datestruct value="1615--"><year reg="1615">1615</year></datestruct>.   The Hope Theatre was near at hand, though we cannot identify its site precisely. 
     <P>The Swan Theatre, near the Globe, was standing previous to <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, and was so named from a house and tenement called the <QUOTE>Swan,</QUOTE> mentioned in a charter of Edward VI., by which the manor of   Southwark is granted to the City of London. It fell into decay in the reign of James I., was closed in <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct>, and was subsequently used only for gladiatorial exhibitions.   Yet in its time it had been well frequented; for a contemporary author says, <QUOTE>It was the continent of the world, because half the year a world of beauties and brave spirits resorted to it.</QUOTE> 
     <P>It may be mentioned here, in passing, that on this side of the Thames there was also another theatre at Newington Butts, of which, however, we know little except the fact that it was <QUOTE>frequented by the citizens in summer.</QUOTE> In the days of the late   Tudors and early Stuarts, the performances usually commenced at <measure value="3d." type=currency><num value="3">3</num> p.</measure>m., and the prices of admission ranged from <QUOTE>a shilling for the best boxes or rooms,</QUOTE> down to sixpence, twopence, and even a penny for the pit and galleries; and it is worthy of note that in the reign of the Protestant Elizabeth plays were acted both publicly and at Court on   Sundays as well as on other days of the week, and under her successor at Court.

    <P>But the theatres were not, as already hinted, the only places of public amusement along the Bankside. A sort of circus, called at the time the Paris  Garden, was erected and opened here about the middle of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, as a place for bear-baiting.   The public were admitted by the payment of a penny at the gate, a penny at the <QUOTE>entry of the scaffold</QUOTE> or raised seats, and a <num value="3">third</num> penny for <QUOTE>quiet standing.</QUOTE> So popular indeed did the sport become that it even trenched on the theatres proper, and reduced their receipts.   In <datestruct value="1591--"><year reg="1591">1591</year></datestruct>, as Mr. Chambers tells us in his <QUOTE>Book of  Days,</QUOTE> an order was issued from the Privy Council forbidding plays to be acted on Thursdays, because that day had been long set apart for <QUOTE>bear-baiting and such pastimes.</QUOTE> The Lord Mayor of London appears to have followed with a public notice complaining that <QUOTE>in some places the players do use to recite their plays to the great hurt and destruction of the game of bear-baiting and such like pastimes, which are maintained for her Majesty's pleasure.</QUOTE> It maybe remarked that Elizabeth had been right royally entertained by Lord Leicester at Kenilworth with combats of dogs and bears, and no doubt often amused herself by witnessing the same scenes nearer home; so that in all probability she was occasionally present at Bankside, when, as we are told, <QUOTE>the baiting of bulls and of bears was the favourite holiday pastime of her  Londoner subjects.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In Aggas's plan of London, taken in <datestruct value="1574--"><year reg="1574">1574</year></datestruct>, and in the plan taken by Braun about the same time, 
<LEMMA id="lemma.51.1">the bear-gardens</LEMMA> are represented as plots of ground with scaffolding for the spectators, bearing the names of the <QUOTE>Bowlle Baytyng,</QUOTE> and the <QUOTE>Beare Baytynge.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>In both plans,</QUOTE> says Thomas Allen, in his <QUOTE>History of Surrey,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>the buildings appear to be circular, and to have been evidently intended as humble imitations of the ancient Roman amphitheatre. They stood in <num value="2">two</num> adjoining fields, separated only by a small strip of land; but some differences are observable in the spots on which they are built.   In Aggas's plan, which is the earlier of the <num value="2">two</num>, the strip of land which lies between   them   contains only <num value="1">one</num> large pond, common to the <num value="2">two</num> places of exhibition; but in Braun's this appears divided into <num value="3">three</num> ponds, besides a similar conveniency near each theatre. The use of these pieces of water is very well explained in <title>Brown's Travels</title> (<datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>), where we find a plate of the  <Q>Elector of Saxony his beare garden at Dresden,</Q>  in which is a large pond, with several bears amusing themselves in it, the account of which is highly curious :-- <Q> In the hunting-house in the old town are <num value="15">fifteen</num> bears, very well provided for, and looked unto.   They have fountains and ponds to wash themselves in, wherein they much delight; and near to the pond are high ragged posts or trees set up for the bears to climb up, and scaffolds made at the top to sun and dry themselves; where they will also sleep, and come and go as the keeper calls them.</Q>  The ponds and dog-kennels for the bears on the Bankside are clearly marked in the plans alluded to; and the construction of the amphitheatres themselves may be tolerably well conceived, notwithstanding the smallness of the scale on which they are drawn.   They evidently consisted, withinside, of a lower tier of circular seats for the spectators, at the back of which a sort of screen ran all round, in part open, so as to admit a view from without, evident in Braun's delineation by the figures who are looking through on the outside.   The buildings are unroofed, and in both plans are shown during the time of performance, which in Aggas's view is announced by the display of little flags or streamers on the top. The dogs are tied up in slips near each place of  <Q>baytyng,</Q>  ready for the sport, and the combatants are actually engaged in Braun's plan.   <num value="2">Two</num> little houses for retirement are at the head of each theatre.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The <QUOTE>Bear Garden,</QUOTE> as this place came in process of time to be called, was still a place of frequent and favourite resort among the cavaliers of the reign of Charles I.; but the sport of bear-baiting went against the consciences, or, at all events, the stomachs, of the <QUOTE>Roundheads,</QUOTE> who did their very best to suppress it. At the Restoration, however, it was revived (with some of the least good points of the Royalist faith and practice), and the Paris Garden again looked up, though only for a time. 
   <P>As a specimen of the sort of amusements which went on here under the Stuart kings, let us take the following out of Samuel Pepys's <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> for   <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>. He writes, under date of <datestruct VALUE="-08-14"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=14>14</day></datestruct>, a few days before the Great Fire of London :-- <QUOTE>After dinner, I went with my wife and Mercer to the Bear- Garden, where I have not been, I think, of many years, and saw some good sport of the bulls tossing the dogs-<num value="1">one</num> into the very boxes; but it is a very rude and nasty pleasure.   We had a great many Hectors in the same box with us (and <num value="1">one</num> very fine went into the pit and played his dog for a wager, which was a strange sport for a gentleman), where they drank wine, and drank Mercer's health <num value="1">first</num>, which I pledge with my hat off.</QUOTE> 
   <P>On the <datestruct VALUE="-05-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct> in the following year, Pepys was again here; for under that date we find him writing:-- <QUOTE>Abroad, and stopped at Bear-garden Stairs, there to see a prize fought.   But the house <pb id="P.52" n="52"> so full there was no getting in there, so forced to go through an ale-house into the pit, where the bears are baited; and upon a stool did see them fight, which they did very furiously, a butcher and a waterman.   The former had the better all along, till by-and-by the latter dropped his sword out of his hand, and the butcher, whether or not seeing his sword dropped I know not, but did give him a cut over the wrist, so as he was disabled to fight any longer.   But Lord! to see in a minute how the whole stage was full of watermen to revenge the foul play, and the butchers to defend their fellow, though most blamed him: and there they all fell to it, knocking and cutting down many on each side.   It was pleasant to see; but that I stood in the pit and feared that in the tumult I might get some hurt. At last the battle broke up, and so I away.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Again he writes, under date <datestruct VALUE="-09-9"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=9>9th</day></datestruct> of the same year: <QUOTE>To the Bear Garden, where now the yard was full of people, and those most of them seamen, striving by force to get in. I got into the common pit, and there, with my cloak about my face, I stood and saw the prize fought, till <num value="1">one</num> of them, a shoemaker, was so cut in both his wrists, that he could not fight any longer; and then they broke off. His enemy was a butcher.   The sport very good; and various humours to be seen among the rabble that is there.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The inimitable secretary would seem   to have been rather partial to this rough kind of sport, for we again find him here on the <datestruct VALUE="1669-04-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>, as shown by the following entry, under that date in his <QUOTE>Diary :</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>By water to the Bear Garden, and there happened to sit by Sir Fretchville Hollis, who is still full of his vain-glorious and prophane talk.   Here we saw a prize fought between a soldier and a country fellow, <num value="1">one</num> Warrel, who promised the least in his looks, and performed the most of valour in his boldness and evenness of mind, and smiles in all he did, that ever I saw; and we were all both deceived and infinitely taken with him.   He did soundly beat the soldier, and cut him over the head. Thence back to White Hall, mightily pleased all of us with the sight, and particularly this fellow, as a most extraordinary man for his temper and evenness in fighting.</QUOTE> 
   <P>John Evelyn went on <num value="1">one</num> occasion to witness the <QUOTE>sports</QUOTE> at Bankside, but apparently he was too disgusted to go there again.   Here is the record of his visit, as told in his <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> under date of <datestruct VALUE="1670-06-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct> :-- <QUOTE>I went with some friends to the Bear Garden, where was cock-fighting, dogfighting, beare and bull baiting, it being a famous day for all these butcherly sports, or rather barbarous cruelties.   The bulls did exceeding well, but the Irish wolfe-dog exceeded, which was a tall greyhound, a stately creature indeede, who beate a cruell mastiff. <num value="1">One</num> of the bulls toss'd a dog full into a <hi rend=italics>lady's lap</hi>, as she sat in <num value="1">one</num> of the boxes at a considerable height from   the arena.   <num value="2">Two</num> poore dogs were kill'd, and so all ended with the ape on horseback, and I most heartily weary of the rude and dirty pastime.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Chambers, in his <QUOTE>Book of Days,</QUOTE> quotes a statement from the learned Erasmus, who visited England in the reign of Henry VIII., to the effect that the royal establishment included a <QUOTE>Master of the King's Bears,</QUOTE> and that even the great noblemen had their bear-wards; and that <QUOTE>many <Q>herds of bears</Q> were regularly trained for the arena.</QUOTE> He also extracts from   Laneham's account of the festivities at Kenilworth Castle the following picturesque description of a bear-baiting   held on <datestruct VALUE="1575-07-14"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=14>14</day>, <year reg=1575>1575</year></datestruct>, the <num value="6">sixth</num> day of her Majesty's stay, when <num value="13">thirteen</num> bears and a number of ban-dogs (a kind of mastiff) were tied up ready in the inner court.   Laneham   quaintly writes, comparing the baiting to a scene in Westminster Hall:-- <QUOTE>The bears were brought forth into the court, the dogs set to them, to argue the points, even face to face. They had learned counsel also of both parts <hi rend=italics>(i.e.,</hi>
on both sides) . . .. Very fierce, both th&lsquo; <num value="1">one</num> and tother, and eager in argument. If the dog in pleading would pluck the bear by the throat, the bear, with traverse, would claw him again by the scalp; confess an he list but avoid he could not that was bound to the bar: and his counsel told him that it could do him   no policy in pleading. Therefore, thus with fending and fearing, with plucking and tugging, scratching and biting, by plain tooth and nail to (the <num value="1">one</num>) side and tother, such expense of blood and of leather was there between them   as a month's licking, I ween, will not recover; and yet they remain as far out as ever they were.   It was a sport very pleasant of these beasts to see the bear with his pink eyes leering after his enemy's approach, the nimbleness and weight of the dog to take his advantage, and the force and experience of the bear again to avoid the assault: if he were bitten in <num value="1">one</num> place, he would pinch in another to get free: if he were taken   once, then what shift with   biting, with clawing, with roaring, tossing, and tumbling, he would work to wind himself from them, and when he was loose, to shake his ears twice or thrice, with the blood and the slaver about his phisnomy (sic) was a matter of goodly relief.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Ben Jonson is reproached by Dekker with having been so degraded as to have performed at Paris <pb id="P.53" n="53"> Garden.   These places seem   always to have been in bad repute even when they flourished most. Crowley, a versifier of the reign of Henry VIII., thus speaks of the Paris Garden : 
  <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=stanza><L>What folly is this to keep with danger

    <L>And methinks these men are most fools of all 
    <L>Whose store of money is but very small. 
    <L>And yet every Sunday they will surely spend

    <L>If you, therefore, go to witness a bear-fight, 
    <L>Be sure God His curse will upon you light.</QUOTE>

  <P>Pennant, who   quotes   these verses, seems to consider the last <num value="2">two</num> lines as a prophecy of the calamity that happened at the Garden in the year   <datestruct value="1582"><year reg="1582">1582</year></datestruct>. An accident, <QUOTE>heaven-directed,</QUOTE> as he says, befell the spectators; the scaffolding, crowded with people, suddenly fell, and more than a <num value="100">hundred</num> persons were killed or severely wounded.   The   Bear Garden, it may be added, in spite of its name, would appear to have been chiefly used, during the latter period   of its   existence, for bull-baiting.   Randolph, in his <QUOTE>Muse's Looking-glass,</QUOTE> makes the following reference to this particular species of amusement : 
                             <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L Part=f>Lastly, he wished 
   <L>The bull might cross the Thames to the Bear Garden, 
   <L>And there be sorely baited.</QUOTE>

   <P>It was to   the Globe Theatre   and   the Bear  Garden probably that Hentzner alludes in   his <QUOTE>Travels in England,</QUOTE> published in the reign of  Elizabeth, when he writes :-- <QUOTE>Without the city are some theatres, where actors do represent almost every day some tragedy or comedy to numerous audiences: these are   concluded   with   excellent music, a variety of dances, amid the excessive applause of those that are present.   There is also another place, built in the form of a theatre, which serves for the baiting of bulls and of bears; they are   fastened   behind, and   then worried by great  English bull-dogs, but not without great risque to the dogs, from the horns of the <num value="1">one</num>, and the teeth of the other; and it sometimes happens they are killed on the spot; fresh ones are immediately supplied in the places of those that are wounded or died.   To this entertainment there often follows a bout of whipping a blinded bear, which is performed by <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> men, standing circularly with whips, which they exercise upon him without any mercy, as he cannot escape from   them   because of his chain; he defends himself with all his force and skill, throwing down all who come within   his reach, and are not active enough to get out of it; on which occasions he frequently tears the whips out of their hands, and breaks them. At these spectacles, and everywhere else, the English are constantly smoking tobacco. In the theatres, fruits, such as apples, pears, and nuts, according to the season, are carried about to be sold, as well as ale and wine.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The theatres and gardens at Bankside, however, in spite of their bad reputation, were occasionally patronised by royalty; for we read that Queen  Elizabeth, on the <datestruct VALUE="1599-05-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1599">1599</year></datestruct>, went by water with the French   ambassadors to   Paris  Gardens, where they saw a baiting of bulls and bears.   Indeed, Southwark seems to have long been of sporting notoriety, for, in the   Humorous 
 <hi rend=italics>Lovers</hi>, printed in <datestruct value="1617--"><year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct>, <num value="1">one</num> of the characters says, <QUOTE>I'll set up my bills, that the gamesters of  London, Horsley-down, <hi rend=italics>Southwark</hi>, and   Newmarket may come in and bait him [the bear] here before the ladies,</QUOTE> &amp;c.   It may here be added, as a scrap of antiquarian information, that the <num value="1">first</num> exhibition of bear-baiting in England of which we read, was in the reign of King John, at Ashby-de-la-  Zouch, where <QUOTE>thyss straynge passtyme was introduced by some Italyans for his highness' amusement, wherewith he and his court were highly delighted.</QUOTE> 
    <P>It is clear that the <QUOTE>sport</QUOTE> to be witnessed in the Bear Garden was still under the patronage and countenance of royalty some century or so later than the reign of Elizabeth, for in <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct> we read of a warrant signed by Lord Arlington, ordering <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> to be paid to Mr. James Davies, the <QUOTE>master of his Majesty's bears, bulls, and dogs,</QUOTE> for <QUOTE>making ready the rooms at the Bear Garden, and baiting the bears before the Spanish ambassadors.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The celebrated actor, <LEMMA id="lemma.53.1">Alleyn</LEMMA>-the founder of Dulwich College, of whom we shall have more to say anon-enjoyed this lucrative post as <QUOTE>keeper of the king's wild beasts, or master of the Royal Bear Garden, situated on the Bankside in Southwark.</QUOTE> The profits of this place are said by his biographer to have been <QUOTE>immense,</QUOTE> sometimes amounting to <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> a year; and will account for the great fortune of which he died possessed.

   <P>We find that, in spite of his Puritan education, King James I. had the good sense to legalise those rational amusements without which life in a crowded metropolis would be past endurance.   It is well known that he published the <QUOTE>Book of Sports,</QUOTE> but it is not equally well known that in <datestruct value="1620--"><year reg="1620">1620</year></datestruct> he issued his royal licence to Clement Cottrell, the groom-porter of his household, to license certain houses for bowling-alleys and tenniscourts, and even for cards and dice. <num value="24">Twenty-four</num> bowling-alleys were licensed under this authority in London and Westminster, <num value="4">four</num> more in Southwark, <num value="1">one</num> in St. Catherine's, <num value="1">one</num> in Shoreditch, and <num value="2">two</num> in Lambeth.

 reasons alleged for this royal grant are stated by Anderson, in the quaint language of the time, to have been for <QUOTE>the honest and reasonable recreation of good and civil people, who for their quality and ability may lawfully use the games of bowling, tennis, dice, cards, tables, <num value="9">nine</num>-holes, or any other game hereafter to be invented.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The Puritans' aversion to the sport, however, as Macaulay remarks, arose not so much from pity for the bull or the bear, as from envy at the pleasure felt by the spectators.   Verily, an amiable and saint-like trait! On the Restoration of Charles II., and the downfall of the Puritan faction, it can hardly be a matter of surprise to find that the legislation which had so long been applied to the suppression of even rational amusements should have taken a swing in the opposite direction. 
   <P>It may be added, that although bear-baiting and bull-baiting never flourished under our later Stuart or our earlier Hanoverian sovereigns, it was not until <datestruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct> that the practice was actually put down by Act of Parliament, which forbade the keeping of any house, pit, or other place for baiting or fighting any bull, bear, dog, or other animal. <QUOTE>And thus,</QUOTE> observes Mr. Chambers, <QUOTE>after an existence <pb id="P.55" n="55">

   <P>Strype, in his <num value="1">first</num> edition of <QUOTE>Stow,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, speaking of Bear Alley, on this spot, says, <QUOTE>Here is a glass-house, and about the middle a new-built court, well inhabited, called Bear Garden Square, so called, as being built in the place where the Bear Garden formerly stood, until removed to the other side of the water; which is more convenient for the butchers and such like, who are taken with such rustic sports as the baiting of bears and bulls.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In the early part of the last century it would seem   that another Bear Garden at Hockleyin- the-Hole, near Clerkenwell, had superseded this place of amusement in the public favour, probably on account of the absence of bridges across the Thames; and consequently, when it is suggested in the <hi rend=italics>Spectator</hi> of <datestruct VALUE="1711-08-11"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=11>11th</day>, <year reg=1711>1711</year></datestruct>, that those who go to theatres merely for a laugh had better <QUOTE>seek their diversion at the Bear Garden,</QUOTE> in all probability the reference is <hi rend=italics>not</hi> to Bankside. 
    <P>The name of the Bear Garden, however, still exists in this neighbourhood, being painted up at the corner of a court between the Bankside and Sumner Street. 
   <P>The old Paris Garden--the name of which, too, still survives in this locality--was circular, open to the sky, surrounded with a high wall, without external windows; the scaffolds, or boxes, were in a wooden structure in the interior, surmounted by a high-pitched roof and a cupola. 
   <P>The names of these and of many other such places of amusement bear testimony to the spirit of national jollity on the part of Londoners during the eighteenth century.   But pleasure-gardens are almost as transitory as pleasure itself; of all these not <num value="1">one</num> now remains <QUOTE>the sad historian of the pensive tale</QUOTE> of bygone mirth and merriment. The jests have passed away, and so are the trees beneath which, and the walls within which, those jests were uttered, and those who pealed back echoes of the loudest laughter are silent in their graves. 
   <P>In   the neighbourhood of the   theatres were several public gardens near the Thames, then a pellucid and beautiful stream.   There were the  Queen's Pike Gardens (now Pye Gardens), where pike were bred in ponds; the Asparagus Garden, and Pimlico Garden.   The last-named was a very fashionable resort, and famous for the handsome dresses of the promenaders.   Indeed, to <QUOTE>walk in Pirnlico</QUOTE> was a proverbial phrase for an introduction to the very <hi rend=italics>elite</hi> of society. 
   <P>In Chambers' <QUOTE>Book of Days</QUOTE> is given a view of London during the Great Fire in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, as seen from the rear of Bankside, from a print of the period by Visscher. The foreground is poetically raised, so as to represent a fairly high hill, though there is no high ground all the way down to Clapham; on it are sitting well-dressed citizens coolly surveying the disaster, while their dogs are lying asleep by their side.   Evelyn writes in his <QUOTE>Diary:</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE><datestruct VALUE="-09-2"><day reg="2">2</day> <month reg="09">Sept.</month></datestruct> This fatal night, about <num value="10">ten</num>, began that deplorable fire neere Fish Streete in London.-<num value="3">3</num>. I had public prayers at home.   The fire continuing, after dinner I took coach with my wife and sonn, and went to the Bankside in Southwark, where we beheld the dismal spectacle, the whole Citty in dreadfull flames neare the water side; all the houses from the Bridge, all Thames Street, and upwards towards Cheapside, downe to the <num value="3">Three</num> Cranes, were now consum'd.....   The poore inhabitants were dispers'd about St. George's Fields, and Moorefields as far as Highgate, and severall miles in circle, some under tents, some under miserable hutts and hovells, many without a rag or any necessary utensils, bed or board, who from delicatenesse, riches, and easy accommodations in stately and well furnish'd houses, were now reduced to extreamest misery and poverty.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Chambers tells us, in his work above quoted, that there was an ale-house in Southwark, which had on its walls an authentic portrait of Dick Tarleton, the eccentric comic actor of Elizabeth's time.   No doubt this <QUOTE>ale-house</QUOTE> was in the neighbourhood of Bankside; but though Dick's name was kept up by tradition for upwards of a century, and though his jests were coll'cted and published, with notes and illustrations, by the Shakespeare Society, it is impossible now to identify the house in which many of Shaker ,;are's players no doubt used to congregate. 
   <P>Another old tavern, formerly standing in the neighbourhood, bore the sign of <QUOTE>The Tumbledown Dick,</QUOTE> which afforded, as the <QUOTE>Adventurer</QUOTE> says, a fine moral on the instability of human greatness, and the consequences of ambition.   It refers, of course, to <LEMMA id="lemma.56.3">Richard Cromwell</LEMMA>, and his fall from   the power bequeathed to him   by his father Oliver.

<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.57.1">Current House, High Street</LEMMA></NOTE>
 
<P>The Borough, High Street, as we have already shown, serving for many centuries as the entrance into London from Surrey and Kent, and, indeed, from the Continent, has always been a very important thoroughfare of the metropolis; but, as a pleasant, gossiping writer of modern times, Mr. Miller, has truthfully observed in his <QUOTE>Picturesque Sketches</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>What a different feature does the Southwark entrance to London Bridge present to what it did only a few brief years ago! Every few minutes omnibuses are now thundering to and from the railway terminus; while passengers think no more of journeying to Brighton and back, and remaining <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> hours there, on a long summer's day, than they formerly did of travelling to Greenwich; for it took the old, slow stage-wagons as long to traverse the <num value="5">five</num> miles to the latter as our iron-footed steed to drag the <num value="500">five hundred</num> passengers at his heels, and land them within sight of the wide, refreshing sea.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Starting from St. Saviour's Church, and passing under the railway bridge which spans the road, we now make our way southward. The alterations made in the High Street, when Southwark Street was planned and formed, involved the demolition of the <LEMMA id="lemma.57.2">Town Hall</LEMMA>.   This building stood at the angle formed by the High Street and Compter Street, and dated its erection from   the close of the last century, when it was built in place of an older edifice, which had become ruinous.   The old Town Hall, in its turn, too, occupied the place of a still older hall, having been rebuilt in the reign of Charles II. After the union of the parish   of St. Margaret-at-Hill with   that of St. Saviour's, the old church of the former parish was desecrated, being   used   partly as a prison, and partly as a court of justice. The building was destroyed in the fire of <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>.   A   statue of the king was placed in front of the building by which it was succeeded; and on the base of the pediment was an inscription notifying the <QUOTE>re-edification,</QUOTE> with the date <datestruct value="1686"><year reg="1686">1686</year></datestruct>.   On <num value="1">one</num> side of the statue were the arms of London; and on the other, those of Southwark.   On the occasion of the rebuilding of the hall in <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, the statue of the king, instead of being replaced in its original situation, was sold, and set up in a neighbouring court called <num value="3">Three</num> Crown Court, upon a pedestal of brickwork, the inside of which, strange to say, was made to serve as a watch-box for a <QUOTE>Charley.</QUOTE> At the same time, a figure of Justice, which had formerly, in conjunction with <num value="1">one</num> of Wisdom, supported the Lord Mayor's seat in the Town Hall, was placed near the bar of a neighbouring coffee-house.   On this event, the following <hi rend=italics>jeu d&lsquo;esprit</hi> is preserved in Concanen and Morgan's <QUOTE>History of the Parish of St. Mary Overy:</QUOTE> -- 
           <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=couplet><L>Justice and Charles have left the hill, 
               <L>The City claimed their place;

               <L>But mark poor Charles's case: 
            <L>Justice, safe from wind and weather, 
               <L>Keeps the tavern score; 
             <L>But Charley, turned out altogether 
               <L>Keeps the watch-house door.</QUOTE>
 <pb id="P.58" n="58"> 
    <P>After remaining for some time in <num value="3">Three</num> Crown  Court, the poor unfortunate monarch, we believe, found a resting-place in the shady nook of a garden in the New Kent Road.   The prison, or compter, as it was called, was removed to Mill Lane, Tooley  Street, but has since been demolished. 
 <NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.58.1">Southwark toward St. Margaret's Hill</LEMMA></NOTE>

    <P><LEMMA id="lemma.58.2">The new Town Hall</LEMMA> was a very plain and unpretending structure.   It consisted of a rusticated basement, from   which rose <num value="4">four</num> Ionic pilasters. The windows were arched, and the interior was fitted up as a police-office. The police-court was eventually removed further southward, to Blackman Street.   In front of the Town Hall, facing Blackman Street, the hustings for the election of representatives for the borough were usually erected. 
    <P>The Town Hall has been occasionally used for criminal trials. Thus we read that on the <datestruct VALUE="1746-06-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct>, <num value="8">eight</num> of the judges went in procession from Serjeants' Inn to the Town Hall on St. Margaret's Hill, and opened the special commission for the trial of the prisoners concerned in the rebellion in Scotland. Those prisoners who were found guilty and received sentence of death were soon afterwards hung, drawn, and quartered on Kennington Common.   Between their trial and execution the prisoners were confined in the new gaol, Southwark. 
    <P>On St. Margaret's Hill, in the immediate neighbourhood of the Town Hall, Southwark Fair was formerly held.   This fair, afterwards so famous, was established by virtue of a charter from   King Edward VI., dated <datestruct value="1550--"><year reg="1550">1550</year></datestruct>.   The charter cost the good citizens of London nearly <measure value="650l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="650">650</num></measure>-a large sum   at that period-and the fair itself was to be held on the <num value="7">7th</num>, <num value="8">8th</num>, and <datestruct VALUE="-09-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>. It was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> great fairs of special importance, described in a proclamation of Charles I., <QUOTE>unto which there is usually extraordinary resort out of all parts of the kingdom.</QUOTE> The fairs here referred to, according to Rymer, were <QUOTE>Bartholomew Fair, in Smithfield; Sturbridge Fair, in Cambridge; and Our Lady Fair, in the borough of Southwark.</QUOTE> It was opened in great state by the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, who rode over London Bridge, and so on to Newington, thence back to the Bridge House, where, of course, was a banquet. <QUOTE>The  <Q>hood-bearer</Q>  on this occasion,</QUOTE> writes John Timbs, <QUOTE>wore a fine embroidered cap, said to have been presented to the City by a monastery in <datestruct value="1473--"><year reg="1473">1473</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Allusions to the fair are frequent enough in the old writers; but it is most familiar to us through Hogarth's picture of <QUOTE>Southwark Fair.</QUOTE> In his time the fair lasted <num value="14">fourteen</num> days, and extended from   St. Margaret's Hill, the spot where it was originally held (near the Town Hall), to the Mint; and of course the visitors comprised a considerable portion of the inhabitants of that favoured locality. In Hogarth's plate--a copy of which we reproduce on page <num value="55">55</num>-we see Figg, the prize-fighter, with plastered head, riding on a miserable nag; Cadman, a celebrated rope-dancer, is represented flying by a rope from   the tower of St. George's Church to that part of the Mint which lies in the rear. of the houses opposite.   The   portrait of another famous rope-dancer, Violante, is introduced by Hogarth.   From   the steeple of the church of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, soon after its completion, this slack-rope performer descended, head foremost, on a rope stretched across St. Martin's Lane to the Royal Mews, in the presence of the princesses and a host of noble personages. Besides these characters, Hogarth shows us a beautiful woman beating a drum, attended by a black boy with a trumpet; a booth tumbling down, and the name of the piece to be performed, the <hi rend=italics>Fall of Bagdad</hi>, is inscribed on the tottering paper lantern. Tamerlane, in full armour, is being taken into custody by a bum-bailiff; and in the background are shows with enormous placards announcing the Royal Wax-work, the horse of Troy, and the wonderful performances of Bankes and his horse.   If the company frequenting the fair was of a strange sort, the entertainments offered appear to have been of a suitable character. From old advertisements of the fair, of dates between <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1740--"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>, we learn that at Lee and Harper's great booth was performed a thrilling tragedy called <hi rend=italics>Bateman, or the Unhappy Marriage</hi>; but, lest the audience should be too much affected, it was lightened by the <hi rend=italics>Comical Humours of Sparrow, Pumpkin, and Sheer going   to the Wars</hi>.   There appears to have been as great a taste for burlesque as that which now exists; but the subjects were curiously chosen. We have the rudiments of a modern pantomime in <hi rend=italics>The Fall of Phaeton</hi>, interspersed with comic scenes between Punch, Harlequin, Scaramouch, Pierrot and Columbine, <QUOTE>which,</QUOTE> we are told, <QUOTE>the town has lately been in expectation to see performed.</QUOTE> The performers, it should be remembered, were not wretched show-folk, but the regular actors of the large theatres, who regularly established booths at Bartholomew's and Southwark Fairs, in which the most charming actresses and accomplished actors thought it no disgrace to appear in the miserable trash mentioned above.   In the biography of <QUOTE>Jo Miller,</QUOTE> we read that the sound of Smithfield revelry had but just died away, to be caught up, as if in echo, by Southwark, when the 
<hi rend=italics>Daily Post</hi>, having shed a tearful paragraph upon <pb id="P.59" n="59"> the opening sepulchre of <QUOTE>Matt Prior,</QUOTE> proceedeth to tell how that <QUOTE>Mr. Doggett, the famous player, is likewise dead, having made a standing provision annually for a coat and badge, to be rowed for by <num value="6">six</num> watermen on the   <datestruct VALUE="-08-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, being the day of His Majesty's happy accession to the Throne.</QUOTE> This was on the <datestruct VALUE="1721-09-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>. <num value="2">Two</num> days afterwards we read, <QUOTE>Yesterday the remains of Mr. Dogget were interred at Eltham, in Kent.</QUOTE> So far the humble player-now for the courtier poet. <QUOTE>The same evening the remains of Matthew Prior, Esquire, were carried to the Jerusalem Chamber, and splendidly interred in Westminster Abbey.</QUOTE> When <QUOTE>Jo</QUOTE> received the news of Doggett's death, we have not the smallest doubt that he was too much overcome to go on with the part he was playing at Southwark Fair; and having that day divided the profits of the Smithfield speculation with Pinkey and Jubilee Dickey, he assiduously mourned his departed master at the <QUOTE>Angel Tavern,</QUOTE> which then stood next door to the King's Bench. 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.59.1">Turkish Rope Dancer</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>Besides the theatrical entertainments, Faux's sleight of hand and the mechanical tricks and dexterity of Dr. Pinchbeck were for many years favourite adjuncts of Southwark Fair. 
   <P>John Evelyn in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date <datestruct VALUE="1660-09-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, says, <QUOTE>I saw in Southwark, at St. Margaret's Faire, monkies and asses dance and do other feates of activity on ye tight rope; they were gallantly clad <hi rend=italics>a la mode</hi>, went upright, saluted the company, bowing and pulling off their hatts; they saluted <num value="1">one</num> another with as good a grace as if instructed by a dancing-master. They turned heels over head with a basket having eggs in it, without breaking any; also with lighted candles in their hands and on their heads, without extinguishing them, and with vessells of water, without spilling a drop.   I also saw an Italian wench daunce and performe all the tricks on ye tight rope to admiration; all the Court went to see her. Likewise here was a man who tooke. up a piece of iron cannon of about <num value="400">400</num> lb. weight, with the haire of his head onely.</QUOTE> 
   <P>From Pepys's own quaint and amusing description, too, we glean some further particulars of the entertainments provided here. On the <datestruct VALUE="1668-09-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>, he writes: <QUOTE>To Southwark Fair, very dirty, and there saw the puppet-show of Whittington, which is pretty to see; and how that idle thing do work upon people that see it, and even myself too! And thence to Jacob Hall's dancing on the ropes, where I saw such action as I never saw before, and mightily worth seeing; and here took acquaintance with a fellow who carried me to a tavern, whither came the music of this booth, and by-and-by Jacob Hall himself, with whom   I had a mind to speak, whether he ever had any mischief by falls in his time. He told me,  <Q>Yes, many, but never to the breaking of a limb.</Q>  He seems a mighty strong man. So giving them a bottle or <num value="2">two</num> of wine, I away.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In the reign of George II. the fairs of London were in the zenith of their fame. Mr. Frost observes in his <QUOTE>Old Showmen:</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>During the <num value="2">second</num> quarter of the eighteenth century they were resorted to by all classes of the people, even by royalty; and the theatrical booths which formed part of them   boasted of the best talent in the profession. Not only were they regarded as the nurseries of histrionic ability, as the provincial theatres came afterwards to be regarded; but they witnessed the efforts to please of the best actors of the London theatres when in the noon of their success and popularity.   Cibber, Quin, Macklin, Woodward, Shuter, did not disdain to appear before a Bartholomew   Fair audience, nor Fielding to furnish them with the early gushings of his humour. The inimitable Hogarth   made the light of his peculiar genius shine upon them, and the memories of the  <Q> Old Showman</Q>  are preserved in more than <num value="1">one</num> of his pictures.</QUOTE> Southwark Fair was not finally suppressed till <datestruct value="1763"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct>.   The booth-keepers used to collect money for the relief of the prisoners in the Marshalsea.

On the destruction of the old Town  Hall, as above mentioned, the sessions for the county were held there, though it was not adequate to the business till the county gaol and a session house were built nearer to Newington Butts. 
   <P>At No. <num value="104">104</num> in the High Street was born Dr. Elliotson, F.R.S., the celebrated physician.

Dr. Elliotson wats a devoted student <pb id="P.60" n="60"> of mesmerism and mesmeric influences, upon which he wrote largely.

   <P>Mint Street, opposite St. George's Church, keeps in remembrance a mint for the coinage of money, which was established here by Henry VIII. at Suffolk House, the residence of his brother-in-law, Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. The mansion was a large and stately edifice, fronting upon the High Street. It was ornamented with turrets and cupolas, and enriched with carved work; at the back, the range of outbuildings formed an enclosed court.   The house was sometimes called the <QUOTE>Duke's Palace,</QUOTE> as well as Suffolk House; and it is likewise mentioned as <QUOTE>Brandonne's Place, in Southwarke,</QUOTE> in Sir John Howard's expenses, under the year <datestruct value="1465"><year reg="1465">1465</year></datestruct>. It was exchanged by the Duke of Suffolk with Henry VIII., the king giving him in return the house of the Bishop of Norwich in St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. On this exchange the mansion took the name of Southwark Place, and a mint was established here for the king's use.

   <P>Edward VI., in the <num value="2">second</num> year of his reign, came from   Hampton Court and dined at this house, where he knighted John Yorke, <num value="1">one</num> of the Sheriffs of London. He afterwards returned through the City to Westminster. Queen Mary gave the mansion to Nicholas Heath, Archbishop of York, <QUOTE>and to his successors for ever, to be their inn or lodging for their repair to London,</QUOTE> as a recompense for York House, Westminster, which was taken from Wolsey and the see of York by her royal father. 
   <P>Archbishop Heath sold the premises, which were partly pulled down, many small cottages being built on the site. Some portion of the house which was left became the residence of Edward Bromfield, who was Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1637--"><year reg="1637">1637</year></datestruct>.   He was owner of the premises in <datestruct value="1650--"><year reg="1650">1650</year></datestruct>.

The entire estate was sold early in the present century, in <num value="98">ninety-eight</num> lots, the rental of the estate having been just doubled.   The family of Lant are still kept in remembrance by Lant Street, which runs from Blackman Street parallel with Mint Street.

 late Duke of Suffolk, in the reign of Henry VIII., coming into the king's hands, was called Southwork 
<hi rend=italics>(sic</hi>) Place, and a mint of coinage was there kept for the king. The inhabitants of late-like those of the White Fryars, Savoy, &amp;c.-have assumed to themselves a protection from arrests for debts, against whom a severe though just statute was made in the <num value="8">8</num> and <num value="9">9</num> William and Mary, whereby any person having moneys owing from any in these pretended privileged places, may, upon a legal process taken out, require the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, the head Bailiff of the Dutchy Liberty, or the High Sheriff of Surrey, or Bailiff of Southwork, or their deputies, to take out a <hi rend=italics>posse comitatus</hi>, and arrest such persons, or take their goods upon execution.</QUOTE> And then follows a long list of penalties, including the pillory, to which all persons resisting their authority are exposed. It is added, <QUOTE>Yet notwithstanding this place pretends as much to Privilege as before, though this Act has supprest all other (such-like) places. And these streets are reckoned within the compass of this Mint-viz., Mint Street, Crooked Lane, and Bell's Rents; also Cannon Street, Suffolk Street, St. George Street, Queen Street, Kin;, Street, Peter Street, Harrow <pb id="P.62" n="62"> Alley, Anchor Alley, and Duke Street, all in the parish of St. George's, Southwork.</QUOTE> The Mint, as the district was called, consisted, therefore, of several streets, whose inhabitants claimed the privilege of protection from arrest for debt--a privilege which, says the <QUOTE>Ambulator</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE>has since been suppressed by the legislature, who have lately passed an Act for establishing a Court of Conscience here for the better recovery of small debts.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The place had become a refuge for the worst characters--in fact, another Alsatia, into which few bailiffs or officers of justice dared to venture. Felons and outlaws, debtors and vagabonds, herded there ; and to this day it is <num value="1">one</num> of the plague-spots of the metropolis.   Marriages, not <hi rend=italics>a la mode</hi>, like those of Mayfair and the Fleet, were performed here constantly, and highwaymen and burglars found a secure retreat in its mazy courts.      Mat o&lsquo; the Mint is <num value="1">one</num> of Macheath's companions, and Jonathan Wild was a frequent visitor.   To poor authors it was a more secure Grub Street; but though duns could not enter, starvation and death could.   Here, in <datestruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>, died Nahum   Tate, once poet laureate, and, in conjunction with Brady, the author of that metrical version of the Psalms which superseded Sternhold and Hopkins's psalmody in prayer-books. Allusion is often made to the precincts of the Mint by the poets and comic writers. The reader of Pope's satires will not forget the lines- 
     <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>No place is sacred, not the church is free, 
        <L>E&lsquo;en Sunday shines no  <Q> Sabbath Day</Q>  to me; 
        <L>Then from the Mint walks forth the man of rhyme, 
        <L>Happy to catch me just at dinner-time.</QUOTE>

   <P>Nathaniel Lee, the dramatist, lived often in the Mint; he had frequent attacks of insanity, and at <num value="1">one</num> period of his life spent <num value="4">four</num> years in Bedlam. He wrote <num value="11">eleven</num> plays, and possessed genius (as Addison admitted) well adapted for tragedy, though clouded by occasional rant, obscurity, and bombast. Latterly, this ill-starred poet depended for subsistence on a small weekly allowance from the theatre. He died in <datestruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct> or <datestruct value="1692--"><year reg="1692">1692</year></datestruct>.   Pope often alludes to the Mint with scorn, and he makes mention of Lee's existence here in the following couplet:-- 
     <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>In durance, exile, Bedlam, or the Mint, 
        <L>Like Lee or Budgell, I will rhyme and print.</QUOTE>

   <P>There are numerous allusions in old gossiping books and pamphlets of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century to the customs of the Mint, the vagabond population of which maintained their privileges with a high hand. If a bailiff ventured to cross the boundary of the sanctuary, he was seized and searched for proofs of his calling; then, when the perilous documents were found, dragged by the mob from pump to pump, and thoroughly soused.   A ducking in <num value="1">one</num> of the open sewer ditches followed, and then he was made to swear, kissing a brickbat debaubed with filth from the <hi rend=italics>cloaca</hi>, that he would never again attempt to serve a process in the Mint. The next step was the payment of certain fees for the purchase of gin. If he had no money in his pockets, he was handed over to the tender mercy of the women and boys, who gave him a few more duckings and shampooings with filthy brickbats, and then kicked him out of the precincts. 
   <P>An attempt was made to curtail the privilege of protection afforded by the Mint in the reign of William III., but it was not finally suppressed till the Georgian era. 
   <P>Thomas Miller, in his <QUOTE>Picturesque Sketches of London,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, gives the following description of the old Mint, which he had written <num value="7">seven</num> years previously, after visiting the remains of this dilapidated neighbourhood:-- <QUOTE>Stretching from St. George's Church, in the Borough, into the high road which leads to the cast-iron bridge of Southwark, are no end of narrow courts, winding alleys, and ruined houses, which a bold-hearted man would hesitate to thread after dusk. Here stand numbers of houses which are unroofed and uninhabited. Years ago they were doomed to be pulled down, and it was resolved that a wide open street should be built upon the space they now occupy. Years may still roll on before they are removed. There is no place like this in the suburbs of London, no spot that looks so murderous, so melancholy, and so miserable. Many of these houses, besides being old, are very large and lofty. Many of these courts stand just as they did when Cromwell sent out his spies to hunt up and slay the Cavaliers, just as they again were hunted in return, after the Restoration, by the Royalists, who threaded their intricacies, with sword and pistol in hand, in search of the fallen Roundheads. There is a smell of past ages about these ancient courts, like that which arises from decay--a murky closeness--as if the old winds which blew through them in the time of the Civil Wars had become stagnant, and all old things had fallen and died just as they were blown together, and left to perish. So it is now. The timber of these old houses looks bleached and dead; and the very brickwork seems never to have been new. In them you find wide, hollow-sounding, decayed staircases, that lead into great ruinous rooms, whose echoes are only awakened by the shrieking and running of large black-eyed rats, which eat through the solid floors, through the wainscot, and live and die without being startled by a human voice. From the Southwark Bridge Road you may see the roofs <pb id="P.63" n="63"> of many of these great desolate houses; they are broken and open; and the massy oaken rafters are exposed to the summer sun and the snow of winter. Some of the lower floors are still inhabited; and at the ends of these courts you will see standing, on a fine day, such characters as you will meet with nowhere besides in the neighbourhood of London. Their very dress is peculiar; and they frequent the dark and hidden public-houses which abound in these close alleys-placed where the gas is burning all day long. Excepting the courts behind Long Lane, in Smithfield, we know no spot about London like this, which yet fronts St. George's Church, in the Borough.</QUOTE> 
    <P> <QUOTE>The Mint,</QUOTE> says Charles Knight, in his <QUOTE>London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>was the scene of  <Q>the life, character, and behaviour</Q>  of Jack Sheppard; and within the same precincts, at the  <Q>Duke's Head,</Q>  still standing in Redcross Street, his companion in villainy, Jonathan Wild, kept his horses. The Mint and its vicinity has been an asylum for debtors, coiners, and vagabonds of every kind, ever since the middle of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century. It is districts like these which will always furnish the population of the prisons, in spite of the best attempts to reform and improve offenders by a wise, beneficent, and enlightened system of discipline, until moral efforts of a similar nature be directed to the fountainhead of corruption. There are districts in London whose vicious population, if changed to-day for <num value="1">one</num> of a higher and more moral class, would inevitably be deteriorated by the physical agencies by which they would be surrounded, and the following generation might rival the inhabitants of Kent Street or the Mint.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The Mint is awfully memorable in modern annals; for amid the squalor of its narrow streets appeared, in <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>, the <num value="1">first</num> case of Asiatic cholera in the metropolis. Again, Thomas Miller, in his work above quoted, refers to this miserable locality when he says, <QUOTE>The  <Q>Land of Death,</Q>  in which we dwelt, was Newington, hemmed in by Lambeth, Southwark, Walworth, Bermondsey, and other gloomy parishes, through which the pestilence<NOTE>The cholera, during the visitation of <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>.</NOTE>
stalked like a destroying angel in the deep shadows of the night and the open noon of day.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In the autobiographical reminiscences of his childhood, which are embodied in his <QUOTE>Life,</QUOTE> by Mr. John Forster, Charles Dickens describes the quaint old streets of <QUOTE>low-browed</QUOTE> shops which lay between Rowland Hill's chapel in the Blackfriars Road, and his humble lodgings in Lant Street, mentioned above, along which he had to pass night by night, in returning from his drudgery at Hungerford Stairs.   He tells us of the boot-lace and hat and cap shops which he patronised, and of another shop conspicuous for its sign of <QUOTE>a golden dog licking a golden pot,</QUOTE> over the door, and which may still be seen at the corner of Charlotte Street, Blackfriars Road. He tells us also how on Saturday nights he would be seduced into the inside of show-vans containing the <QUOTE>Fat Pig,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Wild Indian,</QUOTE> and the <QUOTE>Little Dwarf Lady,</QUOTE> in this immediate neighbourhood. 
   <P>In the early part of the year <datestruct value="1877"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>, steps were taken by the Metropolitan Board of Works with the view of levelling with the ground a large part of the disreputable neighbourhood now   under notice.   The areas comprised Mint Street, King Street, and Elizabeth Place. Mint Street area included the wretched street of that name, associated with robberies and crimes of all sorts, which leads from the Borough to Southwark Bridge Road; and it was further proposed to widen the new street and Harrow Street to a minimum width of <num value="30">thirty</num> feet, and to extend Little Lant Street of the same width into Mint Street, at a cost of over <measure value="15000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="15000">15,000</num></measure>. 
   <P>Great Suffolk Street, nearer <QUOTE>Stones' End,</QUOTE> is named from   Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, who, as stated above, lived here, in Suffolk House. This street was formerly known by the name of <QUOTE>Dirty Lane,</QUOTE> an appellation which it very well deserved.   The <QUOTE>Moon-rakers</QUOTE> is the sign of a public-house in this street, where it has stood for upwards of half a century. <QUOTE>The original of this,</QUOTE> says Mr. Larwood, in his <QUOTE>History of Sign-boards,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>may have been <num value="1">one</num> of the stories of the  <Q>Wise Men of Gotham.</Q>  A party of them going out <num value="1">one</num> bright night, saw the reflection of the moon in the water; and, after due deliberation, decided that it was a green cheese, and so raked for it. Another version is, that some Gothamites, passing in the night over a bridge, saw from the parapet the moon's reflection in the river below, and took it for a green cheese. They held a consultation as to the best means of securing it, when it was resolved that <num value="1">one</num> should hold fast to the parapet whilst the others hung from him hand-in-hand, so as to form a chain to the water below, the last man to seize the prize.   When they were all in this position, the uppermost, feeling the load heavy, and his hold giving away, called out,  <Q>Hallo! you below, hold tight while I take off my hand to spit on it!</Q>  The wise men below replied,  <Q>All right!</Q>  upon which he let go his hold, and they all dropped into the water, and were drowned.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In this street lived the last barber who let blood and drew teeth in London, the last of the <pb id="P.64" n="64"> barbersurgeons; he died there about <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>, as Mr. Cunningham was told by an old and intelligent hairdresser in the Strand; <QUOTE>To which,</QUOTE> adds Mr. John Timbs, in his <QUOTE>Autobiography,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>I may add my remembrance of his shop-window, with its heap of drawn teeth, and the barber's pole at the door. His name was Middleditch, and, <foreign lang=la>renovare dolorem,</foreign>
I have a vivid recollection of his dentistry.</QUOTE> 
   <P>At the corner of Great Suffolk Street and Southwark Bridge Road stands Winchester Hall. This is neither more nor less than a concert-room, of the ordinary music-hall type, and is attached to a public-house which originally bore the sign of <QUOTE>The Grapes.</QUOTE> Close by this spot, in former times, were some well-known pleasure-grounds. They bore the name of Finch's Grotto Gardens, and were situated on the west side of Southwark Bridge Road. They were <num value="1">first</num> opened as a place of public resort about the <num value="1">first</num> year of the reign of George III. Here Suett and Nan Cuttley acted and sang, if we may trust the statement of John Timbs, who adds that the old Grotto House was burnt down in <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>, but soon afterwards rebuilt, a stone being inserted in its wall with the following inscription:--

    <P> <QUOTE>Within my remembrance,</QUOTE> writes Mr. John Reynolds in his agreeable work, <QUOTE>Records of My Life,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>there was a place called Finch's Grotto Gardens, a sort of minor Vauxhall, situated near the <LEMMA id="lemma.64.1">King's Bench Prison</LEMMA>. There was a grotto in the middle of the garden, and an orchestra and rotunda. The price of admission was sixpence, and the place was much frequented by the humbler classes.</QUOTE> He goes on to say, as a proof of the estimate in which the place was held, that Tommy Lowe, after having once been proprietor of Marylebone Gardens, and having kept his carriage, <QUOTE>was absolutely reduced to the necessity of accepting an engagement at these Grotto Gardens.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Finch's Grotto Gardens, doubtless, was <num value="1">one</num> of those suburban tea-gardens which were at <num value="1">one</num> time pretty plentiful in the outskirts of London. The  Prussian writer, D&lsquo;Archenholz, in his account of  England, published towards the close of the last century, is represented by Chambers as observing that, <QUOTE>The English take a great delight in the public gardens near the metropolis, where they assemble and take tea together in the open air. The number of these in the neighbourhood of the capital is amazing, and the order, regularity, neatness, and even elegance of them are truly admirable. They are, however,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>very rarely frequented by people of fashion; but the middle and lower ranks go there often, and seem much delighted with the music of an organ which is usually played in an adjoining building.</QUOTE> 
   <P>A large building, occupying <num value="3">three</num> sides of a quadrangle, adjoining Finch's Grotto Gardens, was at <num value="1">one</num> time the workhouse of St. Saviour's parish. It was built at an expense of about <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure>, and was opened in <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct>. Under the new Poor Law Act, the parish of St. Saviour's forms a union with that of Christchurch; St. Saviour's is the larger parish of the <num value="2">two</num>. 
   <P>At the south-west corner of Blackman Street, and at the entrance to the Borough Road, stands the large building, surrounded by a high brick wall, formerly known as the King's (or Queen's) Bench Prison. The original King's Bench Prison stood on the east side of the High Street, near the Marshalsea, and was certainly as old as the time of Richard II. Thither Prince Hal (afterwards Henry V.) was sent by Judge Gascoigne for endeavouring to rescue a convicted prisoner, <num value="1">one</num> of his personal attendants--that is, if we may believe the genial old gossiper, Stow-but some historians have repudiated the story altogether. It is, however, mentioned by Hall, Grafton, and Sir Thomas Elyot, a favourite of Henry VIII., in his book called <QUOTE>The Governour.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In a play called <hi rend=italics>Henry V.  </hi>., written in the time of Elizabeth, before <datestruct value="1592--"><year reg="1592">1592</year></datestruct>, in the scene in which the historical account of the violence of the prince against the chief justice is introduced, <LEMMA id="lemma.64.2">Richard Tarlton</LEMMA>, a famous comedian and mimic, acts both judge and clown. <num value="1">One</num> Knell, another droll comedian of the time, acted the prince, and gave the chief justice such a blow as felled him to the ground, to the great diversion of the audience.

    <P>Readers of the <QUOTE>Uncommercial Traveller</QUOTE> of  Charles Dickens will not forget the glimpse that we catch from him of the interior of the old King's  Bench Prison, and of its many inmates suffering and dying of the <QUOTE>dry-rot.</QUOTE> The prison was removed to the present situation towards the close of the last century. Wilkes was confined here in <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct>, and the mob endeavoured to rescue him.  A riot ensued, the military were called out, and fired on the people in St. George's Fields, which 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.64.3">Kempe</LEMMA></NOTE>
 <pb id="P.65" n="65"> at that time extended as far as this spot.   A spectator, William Allen, was killed, and the jury returned a verdict of <QUOTE>wilful murder</QUOTE> against the soldier who fired the shot.   The soldier was a Scotchman, a countryman of <QUOTE>Jack Boot,</QUOTE> and in those days that was enough to condemn him. The tomb of Allen might be seen in the old church at Newington Butts.   The King's Bench Prison was burnt down by Lord George Gordon's rioters in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>. It was, however, speedily rebuilt, and is thus described by Mr. Allen, in his <QUOTE>History of Surrey,</QUOTE> <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct> :-- <QUOTE>The prison occupies an extensive area of ground; it consists of <num value="1">one</num> large pile of building, about <num value="120">120</num> yards long. The south, or principal front, has a pediment, under which is a chapel. There are <num value="4">four</num> pumps of spring and river water.   Here are <num value="224">224</num> rooms, or apartments, <num value="8">eight</num> of which are called state-rooms, which are much larger than the others. Within the walls are a coffee-house and <num value="2">two</num> public-houses; and the shops and stalls for meat, vegetables, and necessaries of almost every description, give the place the appearance of a public market; while the numbers of people   walking about, or engaged in various amusements, are little calculated to impress the stranger with an idea of distress, or even of confinement. The walls surrounding the prison are about <num value="30">thirty</num> feet high, and are surmounted by 
<hi rend=italics>cheveaux de frise</hi>; but the liberties, or  <Q>rules,</Q>  as they are called, comprehend all St. George's Fields, <num value="1">one</num> side of Blackman Street, and   part of the Borough High Street, forming an area of about <num value="3">three</num> miles in circumference.   These rules are usually purchasable after the following rate, by the prisoners: <num value="5">five</num> guineas for small debts; <num value="8">eight</num> guineas for the <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">first hundred</num> pounds</measure> of debt, and about half that sum for every subsequent <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure>.   Day-rules, of which <num value="3">three</num> may be obtained in every term, may also be purchased for <measure value="4s. 2d." type=Currency><num value="4">4</num>s. <num value="2">2</num>d.</measure> for the <num value="1">first</num> day, and <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> iod. for the others. Every description of purchasers must give good security to the governor, or, as he is called, marshal. Those who buy the <num value="1">first</num>-mentioned may take up their residence anywhere within the precincts described; but the day-rules only authorised the prisoner to go out on those days for which they are bought.   These privileges,</QUOTE> adds the writer, <QUOTE>render the King's Bench the most desirable (if such a word may be thus applied) place of incarceration for debtors in England; hence persons so situated frequently remove themselves to it by 
<hi rend=italics>habeas corpus</hi> from the most distant prisons in the kingdom.</QUOTE> A   strict attention to the <QUOTE>rules,</QUOTE> it may be added, was very seldom enforced--.a fact so notorious, that when Lord Ellenborough, as chief justice of the King's Bench, was once applied to for an extension of the <QUOTE>rules,</QUOTE> his lordship gravely replied that he really could perceive no grounds for the application, since to his certain knowledge the rules already extended to the East Indies!   In cases of this kind, however, when discovery took place, the marshal became answerable for the escape of the debtor.   This prison was properly a place of confinement for all cases that could be tried in the Court of King's Bench. 
    <P> <QUOTE>The   discipline of the prison,</QUOTE> writes Mr.  Richardson, in his <title>Recollections of the Last Half  Century</title>, <QUOTE>was tyrannical, yet lax, capricious and undefined. The regulations were either enforced with   violence   and   suddenness, or suffered   to become a dead letter.   Nobody cared much about them; and at <num value="1">one</num> time or other they were broken by every prisoner within the walls. Occasionally an example was made of a more than usually refractory inmate; but the example was despised as a warning, and operated as an incentive to infraction. The law by which the prisoners were kept in some sort of moral subordination emanated from   themselves, and from   the necessity which is recognised in all communities of combinations of the weak to resist the oppressions of the strong, a very mild administration of justice was acknowledged   and   enforced.   The   exigencies of the system demanded dispatch and vigour. A sort of   <Q>lynch-law</Q>  superseded the orders of the marshal.  It was the duty of that functionary to reside in a house in the court-yard, within the outward boundary of the prison.   It was meant by the legislature that he should be at hand to administer justice, to attend to applications for redress, to enforce obedience by his presence, prevent dis turbance among the unruly host of his subjects, and to carry into effect the orders which, as a servant of the Court of King's Bench, he was bound to see respected.   It is notorious that Mr.  Jones, for many years the marshal of the prison, did not reside. He was only in attendance on certain days at his office, and held a sort of court of inquiry into the state of his trust, the turnkeys and the deputy-marshal acting as <hi rend=italics>amici curie</hi>,   and instructing him in his duties. He made, at stated times, inspections of the prison; and in his periodical progress was attended by his subordinates in great state.   He was a fat, jolly man, rather slow in his movements, not very capable of detecting abuses by his own observation, and not much assisted in his explorations by others. It was a mere farce to see him waddle round the prison.   His visits produced no beneficial effect: the place, somewhat more orderly during the time of his stay, on the <pb id="P.66" n="66"> moment of his departure relapsed into its normal state of irregularity and disorder.   In the halcyon days of his authority there was no such institution as the Court for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors. The legislature from time to time cleared out the over-gorged prisons by passing Acts to discharge unfortunate insolvents, and what was called the  <Q>Lords' Act</Q>  helped   to prevent the enormous conflux of such people. But this inefficient kind of legislation was not what was wanted; it acted as a temporary alleviation of the miseries and abominations of the system, but it failed to abate. the nuisance, which may be said to have flourished with renewed vigour from   the prunings which removed its effects.   The consequence was that the prison was crowded with persons of all classes,

 ranks, callings, professions and mysteries-nobles and ignobles, parsons, lawyers, farmers, tradesmen, shopmen, colonels,   captains, gamblers, horsedealers, publicans, butchers, &amp;c.   The wives of many of these shared the fortunes and misfortunes of their husbands; and scores of widows and spinsters were amongst the majority who could not pass the gates.

Except the entrance, where the turnkeys keep watch and ward, there is nothing in the place that looks like a gaol, or bears the least colour of restraint.   The street is crowded with passengers; tradesmen of all kinds here exercise their different professions; hawkers of all sorts are admitted to call and vend their wares, as in any open street in London. There are butchers' stands, chandlers' shops, a surgery, a tap-house, well frequented, and a public kitchen, in which provisions are dressed for all the prisoners gratis, at the expense of the publican. Here the voice of misery never complains, and, indeed, little else is to be heard but the sound of mirth and jollity. At the further end of the street, on the right hand, is a little paved court leading to a separate building, consisting of <num value="12">twelve</num> large apartments, called staterooms, well furnished, and fitted up for the reception of the better sort of Crown prisoners; and on the other side of the street, facing a separate direction of ground, called the common side, is a range of rooms occupied by prisoners of the lowest order, who share the profits of a beggingbox, and are maintained by this practice and some established funds of charity.   We ought also to observe that the gaol is provided with a neat chapel, in which a clergyman, in consideration of a certain salary, performs divine service every Sunday.</QUOTE> 
   <P>John Howard, the philanthropist, found in the King's Bench Prison a subject for deserved complaint.   He   describes the Gatehouse at Westminster as empty, but this as full to overflowing.

The result was that he was sent to the King's Bench, and had to start afresh with a capital of <measure value="40l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40">40</num></measure> in hand! No wonder that next year he thought of trade in earnest as much better than such precarious work. Not long before this, Major Hanger--as he was more frequently called-had become <num value="1">one</num> of the jovial associates of the then Prince of Wales, who made him <num value="1">one</num> of his equerries, with a salary of <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure> a year, an appointment which, together with the employment which he undertook of raising recruits for the East  India Company, afforded him the means of living for a time like a gentleman.

    <P>In a large house, on the east side of this street, resided for many years Mr. (afterwards Sir James) South, the son of a chemist and druggist.

Between <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, from the roof of his house, which was nearly opposite Lant Street, he, in conjunction with Mr. (afterwards Sir) J.

Herschel, made some valuable observations on <num value="380">380</num> double and triple stars, both astronomers being armed with what in that day were considered powerful telescopes of <num value="5">five</num> inches aperture, constructed by Tulley. A few years later South removed to Campden Hill, Kensington, where he fitted up a telescope of larger dimensions. Of the sale of his instruments at the last-named place we have given an account in a former chapter.<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="131">131</num>.</NOTE>   He was <num value="1">one</num> of the founders of the Royal Astronomical Society, and was knighted by William IV. in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>.

Many years ago, when it was thought desirable by some persons to have a <num value="2">second</num> national observatory, Sir James South offered to build it at his own expense, and endow it with his own magnificent instruments; but the offer was declined by the Government. A scientific account of Sir James South's astronomical observations in Blackman Street, and of their results, accompanied by an elaborate description of the <num value="5">five</num>-feet and <num value="7">seven</num>-feet telescopes with which they were made, will be found in the <QUOTE>Philosophical Transactions</QUOTE> for <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>.

    <P>Until the formation of the Dover Road early in the present century, Kent Street, commencing eastward of St. George's Church, at the north end of Blackman Street, was part of the great way from Dover and the Continent to the metropolis. This narrow thoroughfare, originally called Kentish Street, was a wretched and profligate place. As far back as <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct> it was described as <QUOTE>very long and ill-built, chiefly inhabited by broom-men and mumpers,</QUOTE> and to the last it was noted for its turners' and brush-makers' shops, and broom and heath yards; yet some of these men rose to wealth and position. John Evelyn tells us of <num value="1">one</num> Burton, a broom-man, who sold kitchen-stuff in Kent Street, <QUOTE>whom God so blessed that he became a very rich and a very honest man, and in the end Sheriff of Surrey.</QUOTE> During the plague in <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, Evelyn, under date of <datestruct VALUE="-09-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, writes: <QUOTE>Came home, there perishing neere <num value="10000">10,000</num> poor creatures weekly; however, I went all along the City and suburbs from Kent Street to St. James's, a dismal passage, and dangerous to see so many coffins expos'd in the streetes, now thin of people; the shops shut up, and all in mournful silence, as not knowing whose turn might be next. I went to the Duke of Albemarle for a pest-ship, to wait on our infected men, who were not a few.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Kent Street was the route taken by Chaucer's jolly pilgrims, of whom we shall have more to say in the next chapter, when dealing with the <QUOTE>Tabard</QUOTE> Inn; by the Black Prince, when he rode a modest conqueror with the French king by his side; and by which Jack Cade's rabble rout poured into the metropolis, quite as intent, we may fairly suppose, upon plunder as upon political reform.   In this street, as early as the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century, stood the Loke, an hospital for lepers, afterwards known as the Lock, a name still retained by the well-known hospital in the Harrow Road, Paddington.<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="215">215</num>.</NOTE>   An open stream, or rather ditch, dividing the parishes of St. George and St. Mary, Newington, was also called the Lock; but whether it derived its name from the hospital, or the hospital from the stream, is uncertain.   It rose in Newington (the open ground on its banks being called Lock's Fields, a name which it still retains), was crossed from early times by a bridge at the end of Kent Street, and flowed through Bermondsey into the river. 
    <P>Kent Street has borne its evil reputation to the present day; and it is immortalised in Charles  Dickens's <QUOTE>Uncommercial Traveller</QUOTE> as <QUOTE>the worst kept part of London--in a police sense, of course-excepting the Haymarket.</QUOTE> Smollett says, <QUOTE>It would be for the honour of the kingdom   to improve the avenue to London by way of Kent  Street, which is a most disgraceful entrance to such an opulent city. A foreigner, in passing this beggarly and ruinous suburb, conceives such an idea of misery and meanness, as all the wealth and magnificence of London and Westminster are afterwards unable to destroy. A friend of mine who brought a Parisian from   Dover in his own post-chaise, contrived to enter Southwark when it was dark, that his friend might not perceive the nakedness of this quarter.</QUOTE> Since the formation of the Dover Road, Kent Street has been no longer the great highway to Kent, a fearful necessity to timid travellers; but it still retains much of its old character, as the chosen resort of broom and brush makers.   Towards the close of the last century this street, although the only thoroughfare from the  City to the Old Kent Road, presented a scene of squalor and destitution unequalled even in St.  Giles's. Gipsies, thieves, and such-like characters, were to be met with in almost every house   and men, women, children, asses, pigs, and dogs were often found living together in the same room.  Filled with a noble desire to do something to instruct and improve the condition of the rising generation in this crowded neighbourhood, Thomas  Cranfield, a hard-working tailor, then residing in  Hoxton, and formerly a corporal at the siege of  Gibraltar in <datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, resolved, if possible, to establish a Sunday-school in Kent Street.   For this pur. pose, in <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, he hired a room, and at once undertook, with no other help than that given by his wife, the education of the <QUOTE>wild Arabs</QUOTE> who came to receive instruction in this novel manner. The <pb id="P.71" n="71"> 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.71.1">New School of St. George the Martyr</LEMMA></NOTE>
 reputation borne by the neighbourhood for vice and profligacy was in itself quite sufficient to deter many persons with any benevolent intentions from venturing into the street. Undaunted by the magnitude of the undertaking, for some months this philanthropic individual and his wife, travelling every Sunday all the way from Hoxton with <num value="3">three</num> of their children, occupied themselves with the task they had set themselves, and with so much success, that in a short time the fruits of their selfdenying exertions became conspicuously apparent to others, and at last other voluntary teachers summoned up courage to undertake the same work. Finding his labours in Kent Street rewarded with success, and being now reinforced by additional volunteers, Cranfield determined to open a similar school in the Mint, close by, a locality even worse than Kent Street.   This school also succeeded, and soon after their establishment these schools were incorporated with the Sunday-school carried on in Surrey Chapel, under the title of the <QUOTE>Southwark Sunday-school Society,</QUOTE> the <LEMMA id="lemma.71.2">Rev. Rowland Hill</LEMMA> becoming the <num value="1">first</num> president.   <num value="9">Nine</num> of these schools still exist, and many of the children born in Southwark within the last <num value="70">seventy</num> years owed their education and their position in after life to the voluntary instruction given in these Sunday-schools. A nobleman on <num value="1">one</num> occasion being present at <num value="1">one</num> of these Sunday-school anniversaries at Surrey Chapel, and being struck not only with the cleanly appearance of the children, but with the respectability of the teachers, asked Rowland Hill what salary the latter received for their arduous duties. Mr. Hill gave the following reply: <QUOTE>It is very little of this world's goods that they get, unless it is now and then a flea, or another insect not quite so nimble in its movements.</QUOTE> 
   <P>St. George's Church, at the corner of the High Street, Borough, and of Blackman Street, is dedicated to <LEMMA id="lemma.71.3">St. George the Martyr</LEMMA>, the patron saint of England.

   <P>Here also was interred John Rushworth, the author of <QUOTE>Historical Collections</QUOTE> relating to proceedings in Parliament from <num value="16">16</num> <num value="8">8</num> to <datestruct value="1640--"><year reg="1640">1640</year></datestruct>.   Rush. worth died in the King's Bench.   In the graveyard of this church it was the custom to bury prisoners who died in the King's Bench and the Marshalsea. 
   <P>In this church General George Monk, afterwards Duke of Albemarle, was married in <datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>, to Nan Clarges,<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="122">122</num>.</NOTE> the daughter of a farrier in the Strand, and widow of another farrier named Radford or Ratford, who had been his sempstress, and <QUOTE>used to carry him linen.</QUOTE> Mr. Henry Jessey, who subsequently became an Anti-Pedobaptist, and was immersed by Hanserd Knollys, was, during the Commonwealth, the minister of this church. 
   <P>The old church having undergone many repairs, and being ruinous, the parishioners applied to Parliament, and obtained an Act to have another church erected in its place; in consequence of which the present edifice was begun in <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>, and <pb id="P.72" n="72"> finished in about <num value="2">two</num> years.   The architect was a Mr. John Price, and the expense of the building was defrayed by a grant of <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure> out of the funds appropriated for building <num value="50">fifty</num> new churches in the metropolis and its vicinity. It was repaired in <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>, at a cost of <measure value="9000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="9000">9,000</num></measure>. The plan of the building is a parallelogram, with a square tower at the west end, surmounted by a <num value="2">second</num> storey of an octagon form, and crowned by an octangular spire, finished with a ball and vane. The church throughout is very plain.   It is built of dark red brick, with stone dressings, in a heavy Dutch style, and has altogether a tasteless aspect.   In looking at such a building as this, well may we exclaim in the words of a divine of the <num value="19">nineteenth</num> century, <QUOTE>Ichabod! the glory of the Church has departed. I never observe the new churches on the Surrey side of the river without imagining that their long bodies and short steeples look, from a distance, like the rudders of so many sailing-barges.   Where is the grand oriel? where is the old square tower? What have we in their stead? A common granary casement and a shapeless spire.</QUOTE> Pennant describes the steeple of St. George's Church as <QUOTE>most awkwardly standing upon stilts.</QUOTE> It may be added 
<FIGURE id="Fig.072" n="2000.14.0028"><HEAD>The Old <QUOTE>Tabard</QUOTE> Inn, In The Seventeenth Century.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 that the large bell of this church is tolled nightly, and is probably a relic of the curfew custom. 
   <P>About midway between St. George's Church and London Bridge, stood in very remote times the Marshalsea, or prison of the Court of the Knight Marshal, in which all disputes arising between servants of the royal household, and offences committed within the King's Court, were adjudicated upon. Its jurisdiction extended for <num value="12">twelve</num> miles round Whitehall, the City of London excepted. It was once of high dignity, and coeval with the Courts of Common Law.   This <LEMMA id="lemma.72.1">Marshal's, or Palace Court</LEMMA>, as it was afterwards called, was removed from   Southwark to Scotland Yard in <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct>; it was abolished by Act of Parliament in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>, and ceased to exist from the end of that year. For very many years no legal business was transacted in the Marshalsea Court, though it continued to be opened and closed with the same legal formalities as the Palace Court, the judges and other officers being the same in both. 
   <P>In the <QUOTE>New View of London</QUOTE> we read: <QUOTE>The Marshal's Court, situate or kept in the Marshalsea Prison on the eastern side of the Burrough <hi rend=italics>(sic</hi>) of Southwark, was <num value="1">first</num> intended for determining causes <pb id="P.73" n="73"> or differences among the king's menial servants, held under the Knight Marshal, whose steward is judge of this court, and whereunto also belong <num value="4">four</num> council <hi rend=italics>(sic</hi>) and <num value="6">six</num> attorneys.</QUOTE> Here follow the names of these <num value="10">ten</num> privileged gentlemen, with a note to the effect that <QUOTE>none except members of Clifford's Inn may practise in this court.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct> we find the Marshalsea described as <QUOTE>the county gaol for felons and the Admiralty gaol for pirates.</QUOTE> 
    <P>We have no exact record of the <num value="1">first</num> establishment of the <LEMMA id="lemma.73.1">Marshalsea prison</LEMMA>, but we find it casually mentioned in an account of a mob riot in <datestruct value="1377--"><year reg="1377">1377</year></datestruct>. A sailor belonging to the fleet commanded by the Duke of Lancaster, Lord High Admiral, was killed by a man of gentle blood, who was imprisoned in the Marshalsea; but it being supposed by the sailors that powerful friends were at work to obtain his pardon, a number of sailors broke into the prison, murdered the offender, and then hanged his body on the gallows, returning afterwards to their ships with trumpets sounding. <num value="4">Four</num> years afterwards, Wat Tyler's followers seized and murdered the marshal of the prison. Bishop Bonner, the last Roman Catholic Bishop of London, having been deposed by Queen Elizabeth. died (as           <num value="24">24</num>f<num value="7">7</num>

 stated above) a prisoner in the Marshalsea, where he had been ordered to be confined. He had been previously imprisoned there during the reign of Edward VI. He was buried, as we have already seen, in St. George's Church, hard by. 
   <P> <QUOTE>Another anecdote is told of Bishop Bonner,</QUOTE> says Charles Knight, in his <QUOTE>London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>at the period of his committal to the Marshalsea, which is worth repeating here, as it shows his temper in a more favourable light than that which the voice of the public ascribes to him. On his way to the prison, <num value="1">one</num> called out,  <Q>The Lord confound or else turn thy heart!</Q>    Bonner coolly replied,  <Q>The Lord send thee to keep thy breath to cool thy porridge.</Q>  To another, who insulted him on his deprivation from the episcopal rank, he could even be witty.    <Q>Good morrow, Bishop <foreign lang=la>quondam</foreign>,</Q>  was the remark.    <Q>Farewell, knave <foreign lang=la>semper</foreign>,</Q>  was the reply.</QUOTE> Bonner died on the <datestruct VALUE="1569-09-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1569">1569</year></datestruct>, having been a prisoner here for about <num value="10">ten</num> years. In Queen Elizabeth's time, the Marshalsea was the <num value="2">second</num> in importance among the prisons in London.   Political satirists, George Wither among them, were confined there; and, in conjuncti.n with the other Southwark prisons, <pb id="P.74" n="74"> it was the place of durance of Udal and other Puritan martyrs. Among other notorious inmates was George Barnwell, who killed his uncle at Camberwell, if we may believe the mock heroic lines on that hero of the shop and counter in the <QUOTE>Rejected Addresses.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct> Colonel Culpeper was consigned to the Marshalsea as a prisoner. John Evelyn tells the story of his seizure, in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date <datestruct VALUE="-07-9"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=9>9th</day></datestruct> of the above year:-- <QUOTE>Just as I was coming into the lodgings at Whitehall, a little before dinner, my Lord of Devonshire standing very neere his Majesty's bed-chamber doore in the lobby, came Colonel Culpeper, and in a rude manner looking   my lord in the face, asked whether this was a time and place for excluders to appeare.   My lord at <num value="1">first</num> tooke little notice of what he said, knowing him to be a hot-headed fellow, but he reiterated it, my lord asked Culpeper whether he meant him; he said, yes, he meant his lordship. My lord told him he was no excluder; the other affirming it againe, my lord told him he lied, on which Culpeper struck him a box on the eare, which my lord return'd, and fell'd him. They were soone parted; Culpeper was seiz'd, and his majesty order'd him to be carried to the Greene Cloth officer, who sent him to the Marshalsea as he deserved.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The Marshalsea escaped Lord George Gordon's rioters, in <datestruct VALUE="1780-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, when the King's Bench, the Borough, and Clink prisons were demolished; but shortly afterwards it was removed nearer to St. George's Church, where it remained until its abolition in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>. At that time it contained <num value="60">sixty</num> rooms and a chapel. 
   <P>For a description of this prison as it was half a century ago, the reader may as well be referred to the <QUOTE>Little Dorritt</QUOTE> of Charles Dickens, who lays within its precincts most of the scenes of the <num value="1">first</num> part, and several in the latter part of the <num value="2">second</num>. These scenes were drawn from life, as the elder Dickens passed here a considerable part of his days while his son was a lad; and here the future <QUOTE>Boz,</QUOTE> coming to visit his selfish and indolent father, picked up much of his practical acquaintance with the lower grades of society and London life, which he afterwards turned to account. <QUOTE>The family,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE>lived more comfortably in prison than they had done for a long time out of it. They were waited on still by the maid-of-all-work from Bayham   Street, the orphan girl from   Chatham workhouse, from whose sharp little worldly, yet also kindly, ways I took my <num value="1">first</num> impressions of the Marchioness in  <Q> The Old Curiosity Shop.</Q> </QUOTE> 
   <P>Most readers of Dickens's works will remember old Mr. William   Dorritt, the <QUOTE>father of the Marshalsea,</QUOTE> and Amy, the <QUOTE>Little Mother</QUOTE> --the <QUOTE>child of the Marshalsea.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>, whilst engaged in the purchase of Gad's Hill, Charles Dickens paid a visit to the Marshalsea, then in the course of demolition, to see what traces were left of the prison, of which he had received such early and vivid impressions as a boy, and which he had been able to rebuild almost brick by brick in <QUOTE>Little Dorritt,</QUOTE> by the aid of his wonderfully retentive memory. He writes to his friend, John Forster, <QUOTE>Went to the Borough yesterday morning before going to Gad's Hill, to see if I could find any ruins of the Marshalsea. Found a great part of the original building, now  <Q> Marshalsea Place.</Q>  I found the rooms that had been in my mind's eye in the story. . . . There is a room there, still standing, that I think of taking. It is the room through which the ever-memorable signers of Captain Porter's petition filed off in my boyhood. The spikes are gone, and the wall is lowered; and any body can go out now who likes to go, and is not bed-ridden.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Some considerable portion of the Marshalsea is still standing, in Angel Court, on the north side of St. George's Church; it is now used for business purposes. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct> was published a book entitled <QUOTE>The Ancient Legal Course and Fundamental Constitution of the Palace-Court or Marshalsea; with the Charges of all Proceedings there, and its present Establishment explained, whereby it will appear of what great authority this Court hath been in all Times.</QUOTE> This is a very scarce little volume, known to few, and unmentioned by the bibliographers. At the time of publication the Court, whose authority was held by Fleta to be next to the High Court of Parliament, was kept every Friday in the Court House on St. Margaret's Hill, and might be held in any other fit place within <num value="12">twelve</num> miles of Whitehall. 
   <P>In the neighbourhood of the Marshalsea prison there was formerly an inn with a sign-board called the <QUOTE>Hand.</QUOTE> If we may trust a statement in Tom Brown's <QUOTE>Amusements for the Meridian of London,</QUOTE> this board, whether it represented the hand of a man or of a woman, was always regarded as an evil sign. 
   <P>Southwark, it is almost needless to remark, embraces an important manufacturing and commercial district. Along the water-side, from Bermondsey to Lambeth, there is a long succession of wharves and warehouses, which all seem to ply a busy trade.   A considerable hat manufacture is carried on in and around St. Saviour's parish. <pb id="P.75" n="75"> Bermondsey abounds with tanners and curriers. Southwark is also the chief place of business for persons connected with the hop trade; and within its limits are probably the largest vinegar-works, and certainly <num value="1">one</num> of the largest breweries in the world.   Apparently, some of the tradesmen of <QUOTE><LEMMA id="lemma.75.1">the Borough</LEMMA></QUOTE> were persons of substance in the Middle Ages. At all events, a writer in <hi rend=italics>Notes and Queries</hi>, on the authority of Mr. W. D. Cooper, says <QUOTE>that a certain Harry Baily, or Bailly, a  <Q>hostelry keeper</Q>  of Southwark, represented that borough in Parliament in the reigns of Edward III. and Richard II.</QUOTE> Mr. Timbs confirms his identity by an extract which he quotes from the Subsidy Roll of <num value="4">4</num> Richard II., A.D. <datestruct value="1380"><year reg="1380">1380</year></datestruct>, in which Henry Bayliff, <QUOTE>Ostyler,</QUOTE> and Christian, his wife, are assessed at <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure>. He adds, <QUOTE>We cannot read Chaucer's description of the Host without acknowledging the likelihood of his being a popular man among his fellow-townsmen, and <num value="1">one</num> likely to be selected for his fitness to represent them in Parliament.</QUOTE> As we have shown in a previous chapter, too, coming down to more recent times, the elder Mr. Thrale, the founder of Barclay and Perkins's brewery, was for some time a representative of Southwark in the House of Commons, as also was Mr. Apsley Pellatt, of the Falcon Glass Works. 
    <P>The tradesmen of Southwark-even if some of them   have attained to opulence-are, however, we fear, like those of most other places; and there are, or have been, <QUOTE>black sheep</QUOTE> among them, for in the <QUOTE>History of Quack Doctors</QUOTE> we read that in the reign of Edward VI. <num value="1">one</num> Grig, a poulterer in Surrey, was set in the pillory at Croydon, and again in the Borough, for <QUOTE>cheating people out of their money, by pretending to cure them by charms, or by only looking at the patient.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The principles of free trade would seem to have been almost unknown in the reign of Edward I., if, as stated by Maitland in his <QUOTE>History of London,</QUOTE> it was ordained that <QUOTE>no person should go out of the City into Southwark to buy cattle,</QUOTE> and the bakers of Southwark in like manner were forbidden to trade in the City. 
    <P>The Surrey side of the Thames being so low and flat, and void of all that can act as a relief to its monotony, was almost on that very account predisposed to be made into a pleasure resort.  Added to this, its rents were low, on account of the tolls upon the bridges, and hence a sufficient number of acres to constitute a public garden were easily obtainable, even by somewhat impecunious speculators, and the very great success of Vauxhall  Gardens had somehow or other familiarised the public mind with the idea that it was the <QUOTE>right thing</QUOTE> to go across the water for pleasure, leaving the cares of home for the north side of the river. 
   <P>The sanitary arrangements of Southwark certainly were not good in the early part of the reign of George III. Pigs and sheep were killed for the London markets in many parts of the Borough. <QUOTE>The kennels of Southwark,</QUOTE> writes Dr. Johnson, during his Scottish tour, with reference to this circumstance, <QUOTE>run blood <num value="2">two</num> days in every week.</QUOTE> 
   <P>We can form a tolerably accurate notion of the extent and appearance of Southwark at the beginning of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. Southward of St. George's Church and the Mint spread St. George's Fields, reaching nearly to the archiepiscopal palace at Lambeth, and the village of Newington. The Kent Road was a lane between hedgerows; and there were bishops' palaces and parks, mansions, theatres, and pleasure-gardens near the green banks of the river.   There were forts for the defence of the borough at the end of Blackman Street, near the Lock Hospital, and in St. George's Fields, where afterwards stood the <QUOTE>Dog and Duck,</QUOTE> at the eastern end of the present Bethlehem   Hospital.   The old High Street of Southwark had gabled houses and large quadrangular inns, dating from the early Norman times; and between them and the Abbey of Bermondsey were open spaces and streams flowing gently towards the river.   Pasture-lands, farms, and water-mills were farther east towards Redriff (now Rotherhithe), and Horselydown was indeed a grazing place for horses. Now all that is changed; but it is pleasant to think of the old days, even amid the constant bustle and crowding at the entrance of the busiest of London railway stations. 
    <P>The journal of a London alderman, at the close of the last century, under date of Sunday, <datestruct VALUE="1797-06-25"><day reg="25">25th</day>  <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>, thus describes the Southwark of his day:-- <QUOTE>I dined in the Boro&lsquo; with my friend Parkinson <hi rend=italics>en famille</hi>, and in the evening walked thro&lsquo; some gardens near the Kentish Road, at the expense of <num value="1">one</num> halfpenny each. We went and saw a variety of people who had heads on their shoulders, and eyes and legs and arms like ourselves, but in every other respect as different from the race of mortals we meet at the West-end of the town as a native of Bengal from   a Laplander.  This observation may be applied with great truth in a general way to the whole of the Borough and all. that therein is. Their meat is not so good, their fish is not so good, their persons are not so cleanly, their dress is not equal to what we meet in the City or in Westminster; indeed, upon the whole, they are <num value="100">one hundred</num> years behindhand in civilisation.</QUOTE> <pb id="P.76" n="76">

 <P>It was probably on account of its proximity to <num value="1">one</num> of our earliest theatres (the Globe), as well as on account of its being on the great southern thoroughfare, that the High Street of Southwark came to abound to such an extent with inns and hostelries. In bygone days it is probable that these inns were still more numerous, as all traffic from the south and south-west of England must have entered London by that route at a time when old London Bridge was the only entrance into the  City for traffic and travellers from the south of the  Thames. 
    <P>We have historic proof that the borough of  Southwark-and more especially the High Streethas been for ages celebrated for its inns. Stow, in his <QUOTE>Survey,</QUOTE> published at the close of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, says :-- <QUOTE>From thence [the Marshalsea] towards London Bridge, on the same side, be many fair inns for receipt of travellers, by these signs: the Spurre, Christopher, Bull, Queen's  Head, Tabard, George, Hart, King's Head,</QUOTE> &amp;c.  Of these inns mentioned by the old chronicler, some few remain to this day; whilst most of the buildings surrounding the old-fashioned yards have been converted into warehouses or booking-offices for the goods department of different railway companies, &amp;c. 
   <P><num value="1">First</num> and foremost of these ancient hostelries, and <num value="1">one</num> which retained most of its ancient features down to a comparatively recent date, was the <QUOTE><LEMMA id="lemma.76.1">Tabard Inn</LEMMA>,</QUOTE> renowned by Chaucer as the rendezvous of the Canterbury Pilgrims, <num value="500">five hundred</num> years ago.   Its name, however, had become changed for that of the <QUOTE>Talbot.</QUOTE> It stood on the east side of the street, about midway between St. George's Church and London Bridge, and nearly opposite the site of the old Town Hall. The <num value="1">first</num> foundation of this inn would appear to be due to the Abbots of Hyde, or Hide, near Winchester, who, at a time when the Bishops of Winchester had a palace near St. Saviour's Church, fixed their residence in this immediate neighbourhood. The land on which the old <QUOTE>Tabarde</QUOTE> stood was purchased by the Abbot of Hyde in the year <datestruct value="1307"><year reg="1307">1307</year></datestruct>, and he built on it not only a hostel for himself and his brethren, but also an inn for the accommodation of the numerous pilgrims resorting to the shrine of <QUOTE>St. Thomas of Canterbury</QUOTE> from the south and west of England, just at the point where the roads from   Sussex, Surrey, and Hampshire met that which was known as the <QUOTE>Pilgrims' Way.</QUOTE> There can be no doubt that by the end of the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century the <QUOTE>Tabard</QUOTE> was already <num value="1">one</num> of the inns most frequented by <QUOTE>Canterbury Pilgrims,</QUOTE> or else Chaucer would scarcely have introduced it to us in that character. 
    <P>The Abbey of Hide was founded by Alfred the Great, and the monks were Saxon to the backbone. When the Conqueror landed at Pevensey, the abbot and <num value="12">twelve</num> stout monks buckled on their armour, and--with <num value="20">twenty</num> armed men hurried to join Harold. Not <num value="1">one</num> returned from the fatal field of Hastings. Abbot, monks, and men-at-arms all lay dead upon the field; and Norman William never forgave their patriotic valour, but avenged it by taking from the abbey <num value="12">twelve</num> knights' fees and a captain's portion--that is, <num value="12">twelve</num> times the amount of land necessary to support a man-at-arms and a baron's fief. Chaucer must have known this history, and his honest English heart must have glowed with the remembrance as he sat in the old hall of the town residence of the successors of the brave  Abbot of Hide. Here it was that the genial poet and the <num value="9">nine</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num> pilgrims met, and agreed to enliven their pilgrimage to the shrine of St.  Thomas a Becket, at Canterbury, by reciting tales to shorten the way. Macaulay says, <QUOTE>It was a national as well as religious feeling that drew multitudes to the shrine of a Becket, the <num value="1">first</num> Englishman who, since the Conquest, had been terrible to the foreign tyrants.</QUOTE> The date of the Canterbury  Pilgrimage is generally supposed to have been the year <datestruct value="1383"><year reg="1383">1383</year></datestruct>; and Chaucer, after describing the season of spring, writes :-- 
      <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Befelle that in that season, on a day,

    <P>John Timbs, in an account of this inn, in the 
 <hi rend=italics>City Press</hi>, says:-- <QUOTE>Henry Bailly, the host of the   <Q>Tabard,</Q>  was not improbably a descendant of  Henry Tite or Martin, of the borough of Southwark, to whom   King Henry III., in the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> year of his reign, at the instance of William de la  Zouch, granted the customs of the town of Southwark during the king's pleasure, he paying to the  Exchequer the annual fee and farm rent of <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> for the same. By that grant Henry Tite or Martin was constituted bailiff of Southwark, and he would, therefore, acquire the name of Henry the bailiff, or Le Bailly.   But be this as it may, it is a fact on record, that Henry Bailly, the hosteller of the   <Q>Tabard,</Q>  was <num value="1">one</num> of the burgesses who represented the borough of Southwark in the Parliament held at  Westminster, in the fiftieth Edward III., A.D. <datestruct value="1376"><year reg="1376">1376</year></datestruct>; and he was again returned to the Parliament held at Gloucester in the <num value="2">second</num> of Richard II., A.D.  <datestruct value="1378"><year reg="1378">1378</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> We have already mentioned him   in the previous chapter. After the dissolution of the monasteries, the <QUOTE>Tabard</QUOTE> and the abbot's house were sold by Henry VIII. to John Master and  Thomas Master; and the particulars of the grant in the Augmentation Office afford description of the hostelry called <QUOTE>the Tabard of the Monastery of Hyde, and the Abbots' place, with the stables, and garden thereunto belonging.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The original <QUOTE>Tabard</QUOTE> was in existence as late as the year <datestruct value="1602"><year reg="1602">1602</year></datestruct>; it was an ancient timber house, accounted to be as old as Chaucer's time. No part of it, however, as it appeared at the time of its demolition in <datestruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>, was of the age of Chaucer; but a good deal dated from   the time of Queen Elizabeth, when Master J. Preston newly repaired it. <QUOTE>The most interesting portion was a stonecoloured wooden gallery, in front of which was a picture of the Canterbury Pilgrimage, said to have been painted by Blake. The figures of the pilgrims were copied from the celebrated print by Stothard.   Immediately behind was the chamber known as the pilgrims' room, but only a portion of the ancient hall. The gallery formerly extended throughout the inn-buildings. The inn facing the street was burnt in the great fire of <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> Dryden says, <QUOTE>I see all the pilgrims in the Canterbury tales, their humour, with their features and their very dress, as distinctly as if I had supper with them at the  <Q>Tabard,</Q>  in Southwark.</QUOTE> A company of gentlemen assembled at the inn, in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, to commemorate the natal day of Chaucer, and it was proposed annually to meet in honour of the vener. able poet, whose works Spenser characterises as

  But the idea, if ever seriously entertained, was soon abandoned. 
    <P>The house was repaired in the reign of Queen  Elizabeth, and from that period probably dated the fireplace, carved oak panels, and other portions spared by the fire of <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>, which were still to be seen in the beginning of the present century. In this fire, of which we have already had occasion to speak, some <num value="600">six hundred</num> houses had to be destroyed in order to arrest the progress of the flames; and as the <QUOTE>Tabard</QUOTE> stood nearly in the centre of this area, and was mostly built of wood, there can be little doubt that the old inn perished. It was, however, soon rebuilt, and as nearly as possible on the same spot; and although, through the ignorance of the landlord or tenant, or both, it was for a time called, not the <QUOTE>Tabard,</QUOTE> but the <QUOTE>Talbot,</QUOTE> there can be no doubt that the inn, as it remained down till recently, with its quaint old timber galleries, and not less quaint old chambers, was the immediate successor of the inn and hostelry commemorated by our great poet. 
    <P>In Urry's edition   of <LEMMA id="lemma.78.1">Chaucer</LEMMA>, published in <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, there is a view of the <QUOTE><LEMMA id="lemma.78.2">Tabard</LEMMA></QUOTE> as it then stood, the yard apparently opening upon the street.  Down to about the close of the year <datestruct value="1873"><year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct> the entrance to the inn-yard was under an old and picturesque gateway; this, however, has been removed altogether, and in its place, on our left hand, a new public-house, approaching the ginpalace in its flaunting appearance, has been erected, and, as if in mockery, it has assumed the name of the <QUOTE>Old Tabard.</QUOTE> <LEMMA id="lemma.78.3">The buildings in the inn-yard</LEMMA>, as they remained down to the period above mentioned, consisted of a large and spacious wooden structure, with a high tiled roof, the ground floor of which had been for many years occupied as a <pb id="P.78" n="78"> luggage office, and a place of call for carmen and railway vans. This was all that remained of the structure erected in the reign of Charles II., out of the old materials after the fire. The upper part of it once was <num value="1">one</num> large apartment, but it had been so much cut up and subdivided from time to time to adapt it to the purpose of modern bed-rooms that it presented in the end but few features of interest. 
   <P>There was an exterior gallery, also of wood, on the left, which, with the rooms behind it, have been levelled with the ground, in order to make room for a new pile of warehouses.   The rooms, dull, heavy, dingy apartments as they were, are said by tradition, to have occupied the actual site, or rather to have been carved out of the ancieni

    <P>Mr. Corner, who has left the best account<NOTE>See <QUOTE>Collections of the Surrey Archaeological Society,</QUOTE> vol. ii., part <num value="2">2</num>.</NOTE> of the old Southwark inn, was of opinion, from personal examination, that there was nothing at all in the remains of the <QUOTE>Tabard,</QUOTE> as they existed at the time of its demolition, earlier than the Southwark fire of <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>, after which   was built the <QUOTE>Pilgrims' Hall,</QUOTE> the fireplaces of which were of this date.   The Rev. John Ward, in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> remarks that <QUOTE>the fire began at <num value="1">one</num> Mr. Welsh's, an oilman, near St. Margaret's Hill, betwixt the  <Q>George</Q>  and    <Q>Talbot</Q>  inns, as Bedloe (the Jesuit) in his narrative relates.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The sign   was ignorantly   changed from   the <QUOTE>Tabard</QUOTE> to the <QUOTE>Talbot</QUOTE> --an old name for a dog--about the year <datestruct value="1676"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>, and Betterton describes it under its new name in his modernised version of Geoffrey Chaucer's prologue.      On the beam of the gateway facing the street was formerly inscribed, <QUOTE>This is the inn where Sir Jeffry Chaucer and   the   <num value="9">nine</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num> pilgrims lay in their journey to Canterbury, anno <datestruct value="1383"><year reg="1383">1383</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> This was painted out in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>; it was originally inscribed upon a beam across the road, whence swung the sign; but the beam was removed in <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct>, as interfering with the traffic. 
    <P>In Urry's view the several wooden buildings are shown.   The writing of the inscription over the sign seemed ancient; yet Tyrwhitt is of opinion that it was not older than the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, since Speght, who describes the <QUOTE>Tabard</QUOTE> in his edition of Chaucer, published in <datestruct value="1602--"><year reg="1602">1602</year></datestruct>, does not mention it. Probably it was put up after the fire of <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>, when the <QUOTE>Tabard</QUOTE> had changed its name into the <QUOTE>Talbot.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The sign in reality was changed in <datestruct value="1673--"><year reg="1673">1673</year></datestruct>, when the signs of London were taken down, <QUOTE>and when,</QUOTE> says Aubrey, <QUOTE>the ignorant landlord or tenant, instead of the ancient sign of the Tabard, put up the Talbot, or dog.</QUOTE> Aubrey tells us further that before the fire it was an old timber house, <QUOTE>probably coeval with Chaucer's time.</QUOTE> It was probably this old part, facing the street, that was burnt. 
    <P> <QUOTE>Chaucer has often been named as  <Q>the well of  English undefiled;</Q>  but from a general review of all his works,</QUOTE> writes Dr. Johnson, in his <QUOTE>Lives of the Poets,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>it will appear that he entertained a very mean opinion of his native language, and of the poets who employed it, and that, during a great part of his life, he was incessantly occupied in translating the works of the French, Italian, and Latin poets. His  <Q> Romaunt of the Rose</Q>  is a professed translation from William de Lorris and Jean de Meun; the long and beautiful romance of  <Q>Troilus and Cressida</Q>  is principally translated from Boccaccio's Filostrato; the  <Q> Legend of Good Women</Q>  is a free translation from Ovid's Epistles, combined with the histories of his heroines, derived from various chronicles.   The  <Q>House of Fame</Q>  is a similar compilation; and  <Q> Palamon and Arcite</Q>  is known to be an imitation of the  <Q>Theseide</Q>  of Boccaccio.   On the whole, it may be doubted whether he thought himself sufficiently qualified to undertake an original work till he was past <num value="60">sixty</num> years of age, at which time   . . . .   he formed and began to execute the plan of his  <Q> Canterbury Tales.</Q> </QUOTE> 
   <P>This elaborate work--the scene of which is laid in the guest-chamber and in the court-yard of the <QUOTE>Tabard</QUOTE> --was intended to contain a sketch of all the characters of society in his time. These were to be sketched out in an introductory prologue, to be contrasted by characteristic dialogues, and probably to be engaged in incidents which should further develop their characters and dispositions; and as stories were absolutely necessary in every popular work, an appropriate tale was to be put into the mouth of each of the pilgrims. It is not extraordinary that the remainder of Chaucer's life should not have been sufficient for the completion of so ambitious a plan.   What he has actually executed can be regarded only as a fragment of a larger whole ; but, imperfect as it is, it contains more information respecting the manners and customs of the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century than could be gleaned from the whole mass of contemporary writers, English and foreign. <QUOTE>Chaucer's vein of humour,</QUOTE> remarks Warton, <QUOTE>although conspicuous in the  <Q>Canterbury Tales,</Q>  is chiefly displayed in the characters, described in the Prologue, with which they are introduced.   In these his knowledge of the world availed him in a peculiar degree, and enabled him to give such an accurate picture of ancient manners as no contemporary nation has transmitted to posterity. It is here that we view the pursuits and employments, the customs and diversions, of our ancestors, copied from the life, and represented with equal truth and spirit by a judge of mankind whose penetration qualified him to discern their foibles and discriminating peculiarities, and by an artist who understood that proper selection of circumstances and those pre. <pb id="P.81" n="81"> dominant characteristics which form   a finished portrait. We are surprised to find, in an age so gross and ignorant, such talent for satire and for observation on life-qualities which usually exert themselves in more civilised periods, when the improved state of society, by .... establishing uniform modes of behaviour, disposes mankind to study themselves, and renders deviations of conduct and singularities of character more immediately and more necessarily the objects of censure and ridicule. These curious and valuable remains are specimens of Chaucer's native genius, unassisted and unalloyed. The figures are all British, and bear no suspicious signatures of classical, Italian, or French imitation.</QUOTE> In fact, in his <QUOTE>Canterbury Tales</QUOTE> Chaucer is at his best, and those Canterbury tales belong especially to the street and house of which we are now treating. 
    <P>It may not be out of place here to give a brief outline of the plan of the immortal work which, as long as the English language lasts, will stand connected with the hostelry of the <QUOTE>Tabard.</QUOTE> The framework of the <QUOTE>Canterbury Tales,</QUOTE> it need hardly be said, embraces a rich collection of legends and narratives of various characters.   The plot may have been suggested by the <QUOTE>Decameron</QUOTE> of Boccaccio, but that is all; for, instead of adopting the tame and frigid device of assembling a bevy of Florentine youths and maidens, who tell and listen to amorous tales, with no coherence or connection, Chaucer has sketched in bold and sharp outlines life-like pictures of the manners and social condition of his age, and has made his figures stand picturesquely forth, as types of the several classes which they represent. 
    <P> <QUOTE>Who has not heard,</QUOTE> asks Dr. Pauli, in his 
 <title>Pictures of Old England</title>, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>of the far-famed sanctuary of Canterbury, where rested the bones of the archbishop, Thomas Becket, who bravely met his death to uphold the cause of the Roman  Church, and who; venerated as the national saint of England, became renowned as a martyr and worker of miracles?   To that sanctuary, year by year, and especially in the spring months, crowds of devout pilgrims flocked from every part of the  Christian world; and although such pilgrimages were no doubt often undertaken from the most laudable motives, it is certain that even in the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century they had become, among the great masses of the people, too often a pretext for diversion . . . . It was such a pilgrimage as this that Chaucer took for the framework of his great poem; and, as a Kentish man, he was probably able to describe from   experience and personal observation all that occurred on an occasion of this kind. The prologue, which is of extraordinary length, begins with a short description of spring, when nature begins to rejoice, and men from every part of the land seek the  <Q> blissful martyr's</Q>  tomb at Canterbury.   At such a season-and some writers have calculated that Chaucer refers to the  <datestruct VALUE="1383-04-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1383">1383</year></datestruct>-the poet was staying, with this purpose in view, at the  <Q>Tabard,</Q>  where pilgrims were wont to assemble, and where they found good accommodation for themselves and their horses before they set forth on their way, travelling together, no doubt, at once for companionship and for mutual protection. Towards evening, when the host's room was filled, Chaucer had already made acquaintance with most of the guests, who were of all conditions and ranks. <LEMMA id="lemma.81.1">The <num value="29">twenty-nine</num> persons who composed the party</LEMMA> are each introduced to us with the most individual and life-like colouring. A knight most appropriately heads the list.   For years his life has been spent either in the field or in the Crusades; for he was present when Alexandria was taken, and helped the Teutonic knights in Prussia against the Russians, fought with the  Moors in Granada, with the Arabs in Africa, and with the Turks in Asia.   <num value="1">One</num> may see by his dress that he seldom   doffs his armour; but, however little attention he pays to externals, his careful mode of speech, and his meek and Christian-like deportment, betray the true and gentle knight. He is accompanied by his son, a slim, light-haired, curlyheaded youth of <num value="20">twenty</num>, the perfect young squire of his day, who is elegantly and even foppishly dressed. He has already made a campaign against the French, and on that occasion, as well as in the tourney, he has borne him well, in the hopes of gaining his lady's grace. Love deprives him of his sleep; and, like the nightingale, he is overflowing with songs to his beloved; yet he does not fail, with lowly service, to carve before his father at table.   In attendance on him   is a yeoman, probably <num value="1">one</num> of his father's many tenants, who, clad in green, with sword and buckler, his bow in his hand, and his arrows and dagger in his belt, represents, with his sunburnt face, that has grown brown among woods and fields, the stalwart race who won for the Plantagenets the victories of  Crecy, of Poitiers, and Agincourt. 
   <P>In contrast with this group appears a daughter of the Church, Madame Eglantine,<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="571">571</num>.</NOTE> a prioress of noble birth, as her delicate physiognomy, and the nicety with which   she eats and drinks, testify plainly.   With a sweet but somewhat nasal tone, she chants the Liturgy, or parts of it; she speaks <pb id="P.82" n="82"> French, too, by preference, but it is the French, not of Paris, but of  <Q>Stratford atte Bow.</Q>  She would weep if they showed her a mouse in a trap, or if they smote her little dog with a rod. A gold brooch, ornamented with the letter A, encircled with a crown, bearing the inscription <hi rend=italics>Amor vincit omnia</hi>, hangs from her string of coral beads. Next to her comes a portly monk of the Benedictine order, whose crown and cheeks are as smooth as glass, and whose eyes shine like burning coals. He, too, is elegantly dressed, for the sleeves of his robe are trimmed with the finest fur, while a golden love-knot pin holds his hood together. Clear is the sound of the bells on his bridle, for he knows well how to sit his horse; whilst hare-hunting and a feast on a fat swan are more to him than the rule of St. Benedict and the holy books in his cell. A worthy pendant to this stately figure is the Mendicant Friar, whose ready familiarity and good humour make him the friend of the country-folks, and the favourite Father Confessor.   No <num value="1">one</num> understands better than he how to collect alms for his cloister; for he knows how to please the women with timely gifts of needles and knives, whilst he treats the men in the taverns, in which he always knows where to find the best cheer. He lisps his English with affected sweetness; and when he sings to his harp his eyes twinkle like the stars on a frosty night. 
   <P>The next in order is a merchant, with his forked beard, his Flemish beaver, and his wellclasped boots. He knows the money-exchange on both sides of the Channel, and best of all does he understand how to secure his own interest. Then follow a couple of learned men. <num value="1">First</num> comes the Clerk of Oxenford (Oxford), hollowed-cheeked, and lean as the horse on which he rides, and with threadbare coat, for he has not yet secured a benefice; but his books are his whole joy, and chief among them is his Aristotle.   He knows no greater joy than learning and teaching; yet he shrinks back modestly and timidly, and nowhere pushes himself forward. The other is a widelyknown Serjeant of the Law, who has at his fingers' ends the whole confused mass of all the laws and statutes from the days of William the Conqueror to his own times, and knows admirably also how to apply his learning practically. Although his heavy fees and rich perquisites make him a rich man, he goes forth on his pilgrimage dressed in a plain and homely fashion. Next follows a Franklyn, who is described as the owner of a freehold estate, and as a man of note in his country, as having already served as knight of the shire, and also as sheriff. There is no stint of good eating and drinking in his house; for the dishes on his board come as thick and close as flakes of snow, each in its turn, according to the season of the year. 
    <P>The working classes are represented by a haberdasher, a carpenter, a weaver, a dyer, and a tap'ster, honest industrious folk, each clad in the dress that appertains to his order, and wearing the badge of his guild.   They have all interest and   money enough to make aldermen at some future time; and their wives would   gladly hear themselves greeted as  <Q>madame,</Q>  and would fain go to church in long and flowing mantles.   With these are associated a cook, who is master of all the delicacies of his art, but who is not the less able on that account to relish a cup of London ale. The  <Q> shipman,</Q>  of course, could not be absent from such a gathering; and here we see him as he comes from the west country, sunburnt, and clad in the dress of his class, equally prepared to quaff a draught of the fine Burgundy that he is bringing home while the master of the ship slumbers in his cabin, or to join in a sea-fight against the foes of his native land.  He has visited every shore, from Gothland to Cape  Finisterre, and he knows every harbour and bay in his course.   The doctor of physic, too, is well versed in all the branches of his art; for, in addition to the skilful practice of his profession, he has systematically studied both astronomy and the science of the horoscope, and is familiar with all the learned writers of Greece and Arabia.   He dresses carefully, and smartly; but he knows how to keep the treasures which he amassed during the prevalence of the  <Q> black death.</Q>  
    <P>Next follows a Wife of Bath, rich and comely, who especially attracts the poet's attention, and who is more communicative in regard to her own affairs than any <num value="1">one</num> else in the company.   She wears clothing of the finest stuffs, a broad hat with a new-fashioned head-attire, red and tight-fitting stockings, and a pair of sharp spurs on her heels. She is already well advanced in years, has been <num value="3">three</num> times to Jerusalem, and has seen Rome and Bologna, Compostella, and Cologne. Her round, fair, reddish face looks a little bold, and shows that after her many experiences of life it would not be easy to put her out of countenance. She relates to   her fellow-travellers, with the most edifying frankness, that she has been married <num value="5">five</num> times, and that, therefore, independently of other considerations, she is entitled to say a word or <num value="2">two</num> about love. She tells them how in her young and giddy days she beguiled and deluded her <num value="1">first</num> <num value="3">three</num> husbands, who were old but rich; and she does not even withhold from them the narration of some sharp  <Q>curtain-lectures.</Q>  Her <num value="4">fourth</num> marriage <pb id="P.83" n="83"> terminated, she tells them, in both parties taking their own way; but her last husband, although he is only <num value="20">twenty</num> years old, has studied at Oxford, and is not to be drawn away from the perusal of a ponderous tome, in which are collected the injunctions of the Fathers of the Church to men to lead a life of celibacy, enriched by examples culled from ancient and modern times, of the manner in which wives are wont to circumvent their husbands. Once, when in her spite she tore some leaves out of this book, she says that he beat her so hard that ever since she has been deaf in <num value="1">one</num> ear, but that since they have got on admirably together.   In opposition to this dame, who forms <num value="1">one</num> of the most important links of connection between the different members of the miscellaneous circle, we have another admirably-drawn character, a poor Parson, the son of humble but honest parents, who, notwithstanding his scanty benefice, is ever contented, even when his tithes fall short, and who never fails, even in the worst of weather, to sally forth, staff in hand, in order to visit the sick members of his flock.   He is always ready to comfort and aid the needy; and undismayed by the pride of the rich and great, faithfully and honestly proclaims the word of the Lord in his teaching.   The Parson is accompanied by his brother, a hard-working, honest, and pious ploughman; and thus the <num value="2">two</num> are brought forward as belonging to that class which was bound to the soil which it tilled. 
    <P>Before the poet leaves this rank of the social scale, he brings before us also several other prominent characters belonging to the people of his day. There is the miller, a stout churl, bony and strong, with a hard head, a fox-red beard, and a wide mouth.   He was not over-scrupulous in appropriating to himself some of the corn which his customers brought to his mill. Over his white coat and blue hood he carried a bag-pipe, and we fear it must be added, that his talk was of a wanton kind.   Next comes the MYanciple of a religious house, who is connected with at least <num value="30">thirty</num> lawyers, and knows how to make his own profits whilst he is buying for his masters. The Reeve of a Norfolk lord, a man as lean as a rake, shaven and choleric, appears dressed in a blue coat, riding a grey horse. In his youth he had been a carpenter; but no <num value="1">one</num> knows better than he how to judge of the yielding of the seed, or of the promise of the cattle. Nobody could well call him to account, for his books are always in the best order, and he and his master are in good accord. The Summoner of an archdeacon, with a fiery-red face, which no apothecary's art can cool down, is appropriately described as <num value="1">one</num> of the lowest and least reputable of the company. Lustful and gluttonous, he cares most of all for his wine; and when he is  <Q> half seas over,</Q>  he speaks nothing but bad Latin, having picked up some scraps of that tongue in attendance in the Courts.   His rival in viciousness is a Pardoner, who has come straight from the Court of Rome. His hair is as yellow as flax, and he carries in his wallet a handful of relics, by the sale of which he gets more money in a day than the Parson can make in <num value="2">two</num> months.</QUOTE>

   <P>Such are the troop of worthy, and some perhaps rather unworthy, guests who assembled in the ancient hostelry a little less than <num value="500">five hundred</num> years ago, and whom the host, Harry Baily, right gladly welcomes in his guesten-room, with the best cheer that the <QUOTE>Tabard</QUOTE> can supply. Whilst the wine is passing round among the company, he proposes, with a boldness often to be seen in men of his craft, to join them on the morrow in their pilgrimage; but takes the liberty of suggesting <num value="1">first</num> that it would be a good means of shortening the way between London and Canterbury, if each pilgrim were to tell <num value="1">one</num> tale going and returning also, and that the <num value="1">one</num> who should tell the best tale should have a supper at the inn at the expense of the rest upon their safe return. Next, without more ado, he offers himself to act as judge of the performances; and his proposition meets with general approval. The company then retire to rest, and the next morning, when the sun is up and the day is fine, they mount their horses at the door of the <QUOTE>Tabard,</QUOTE> and, turning their backs on London, take the road into Kent. The plan of our work will not allow us to follow them beyond St. George's Church, where they branch to the left along the Old Kent Road, towards Blackheath and Rochester, and so on to Becket's shrine. It only remains to add that the poet did not live to complete even half of his projected poem, which breaks off somewhat abruptly before the pilgrims actually enter Canterbury, and hence, to our lasting regret, we lose the expected pleasure of a graphic description of their sayings and doings in that city, and of their promised feast upon returning to Southwark. With the tale, or rather discourse, of the Parson, Chaucer brings his pilgrims to Canterbury; <QUOTE>but,</QUOTE> observes Mr. T. Wright, <QUOTE>his original plan evidently included the journey back to London. Some writer, within a few years after Chaucer's death, undertook to continue the work, and produced a ludicrous account of the proceedings of the pilgrims at Canterbury, and the story of Beryn, which was to be the <num value="1">first</num> of the stories told on their return. These are printed by Urry, from a <pb id="P.84" n="84"> manuscript, to which, however, he is anything but faithful.</QUOTE> 
   <P>As. regards the name of the inn now under notice, Stow says of the <QUOTE>Tabard</QUOTE> that <QUOTE>it was so called of a jacket, or sleeveless coat, whole before, open on both sides, with a square collar, winged at the shoulders. A stately garment of old time, commonly worn of noblemen and others, both at home and abroad in the wars; but then (to wit, in the wars) with their arms embroidered depicted upon them, that every man by his coat of arms might be known from others.   But now these tabards are only worn by the heralds, and be called their coats of arms in service.</QUOTE> The name of the dress is, or was till very lately, kept in remembrance by the

It may be added that the name of the author of the <QUOTE>Canterbury Tales</QUOTE> will still be kept in remembrance in Southwark by the <QUOTE>Chaucer</QUOTE> lodge of Freemasons which has been instituted at the <QUOTE>Bridge House Tavern.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In the middle of the last century, the <QUOTE>Tabard</QUOTE> (or Talbot) appears to have become a great inn for carriers and for posting, and a well-known place of accommodation for visitors to London from distant parts of the country. Mr. Thomas Wright, F.S.A., remarks, <QUOTE>When my grandfather visited London towards the close of the reign of George II., or early in that of George III., he tells me in his <pb id="P.85" n="85">  <Q>Autobiography</Q>  that he and his companions took up their quarters as guests at the  <Q>Talbot,</Q>  in Southwark.</QUOTE>

   <P>Among the historic inns of Southwark to which we are introduced by Mr. John Timbs in his 
<title>London and Westminster</title>, is <num value="1">one</num> called the <QUOTE><LEMMA id="lemma.85.2">George</LEMMA>,</QUOTE> which also stood near the <QUOTE>Tabard.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>This inn,</QUOTE> says Mr. Timbs, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>is mentioned by Stow, and even earlier, in <datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct>, the <num value="35">thirty-fifth</num> year of King Henry VIII. Its name was then the  <Q>St. George.</Q>  There is no further trace of it till the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, when there are <num value="2">two</num> tokens issued from this inn. Mr. Burn quotes the following lines from   the <hi rend=italics>Musarum Delicia</hi>, upon a surfeit by drinking bad sack at the  <Q>George Tavern,</Q>  in Southwark:-- 
       <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Oh, would I might turn poet for an hour, 
       <L>To satirise with a vindictive power 
       <L>Against the drawer; or could I desire 
       <L>Old Johnson's head had scalded in the fire; 
       <L>How would he rage, and bring Apollo down 
       <L>To scold with Bacchus, and depose the clown 
       <L>For his ill government, and so confute 
       <L>Our poets, apes, that do so much impute 
       <L>Unto the grape inspirement.</QUOTE></QUOTE>

   <P>In the year <datestruct value="1670"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct> the <QUOTE>George</QUOTE> was in great part burnt down and demolished by a fire which broke out in this neighbourhood, and it was totally consumed by the great fire of Southwark some <num value="6">six</num> years later; the owner was at that time <num value="1">one</num> John <pb id="P.86" n="86"> Sayer, and the tenant Mark   Weyland. <QUOTE>The present  <Q>George Inn,</Q> </QUOTE> continues Mr. Timbs, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>although built only in the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, seems to have been rebuilt on the old plan, having open wooden galleries leading to the chambers on each side of the inn-yard. After the fire, the host, Mark Weyland, was succeeded by his widow, Mary Weyland; and she by William   Golding, who was followed by Thomas Green, whose niece, Mrs. Frances Scholefield, and her then husband, became landlord and landlady in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>. Mrs. Scholefield died at a great age in <datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>.   The property has since been purchased by the governors of Guy's Hospital. 
    <P>The  <Q>George</Q>  is mentioned in the records relating to the  <Q>Tabard,</Q>  to which it adjoins, in the reign of King Henry VIII., as the  <Q>St. George Inn.</Q>  <num value="2">Two</num> tokens of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, in the Beaufoy Collection at Guildhall Library, admirably catalogued and annotated by Mr. Burn, give the names of <num value="2">two</num> landlords of the  <Q>George</Q>  at that period-viz.,  <Q>Anthony Blake, tapster,</Q>  and  <Q>James Gunter.</Q> </QUOTE>

   <P>The <QUOTE>White   Hart,</QUOTE> on the same side of the High Street, was, according to Hatton, the inn which had the largest sign in London, save and except the <QUOTE>Castle</QUOTE> in Fleet Street.   This also is <num value="1">one</num> of the inns mentioned by Stow in his <QUOTE>Survey;</QUOTE> but, as John Timbs tells us, it possesses a still earlier celebrity, having been the head-quarters of Jack Cade and his rebel rout during their brief possession of London in <datestruct value="1450--"><year reg="1450">1450</year></datestruct>.   Shakespeare, in the <num value="2">Second</num> Part of <hi rend=italics>King Henry VI.</hi>, makes a messenger enter in haste, and announce to the king- 
      <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>The rebels are in Southwark. Fly, my lord! 
        <L>Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer, 
        <L>Descended from the Duke of Clarence&lsquo; house, 
        <L>And calls your grace usurper openly, 
        <L>And vows to crown himself in Westminster.</QUOTE>
And again, another messenger enters, and says- 
         <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Jack Cade hath gotten London Bridge; 
           <L>The citizens fly and forsake their houses.</QUOTE>
Afterwards, Cade thus addresses his followers:-- <QUOTE>Will you needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks? Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates, that you should leave me at the  <Q>White Hart,</Q>  in Southwark?</QUOTE> 
   <P>Fabyan, in his <QUOTE>Chronicles,</QUOTE> has this entry:-- <QUOTE>On <datestruct VALUE="1450-07-1"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1450>1450</year></datestruct>, Jack Cade arrived in Southwark, where he lodged at the  <Q>Hart;</Q>  for he might not be suffered to enter the City.</QUOTE> The following deed of violence committed by Cade's followers at this place is recorded in the <QUOTE>Chronicle of the Grey Friars:</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>At the Whyt Harte, in Southwarke, <num value="1">one</num> Hawaydyne, of Sent Martyns, was beheddyd.</QUOTE> 
    <P>It is quite possible, however, that Shakespeare, and the historians who have been content to follow in his wake, have done injustice to the character of Cade, exaggerating his faults, and suppressing all notice of his virtues. As Mr. J. T. Smith remarks, in his work on <QUOTE>The Streets of London :</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>In an unhappy time, when the fields of England were strewed with dead, in the quarrels of contending factions, when the people had scarcely the shadow of a right, and were never thought of by the rulers of the land, except when they wanted folks to fight their battles, or when they needed money that could by any possibility be wrung or squeezed out of the population, this man, the despised Jack Cade, stood forward to plead the cause of the million.   He made himself the voice of the people: he understood their grievances, and made a bold effort to redress them; and if that effort was a violent <num value="1">one</num>, it was the fault of the age, rather than of the man. A list of the grievances complained of by Cade, preserved in Stow's <title>Annals</title>, gives a high opinion of his shrewdness and moderation, and makes him   appear anything but the ignorant man it has been the fashion to represent him. The City of London was long in his favour, and its merchants supplied him, without murmur, with sufficient rations for his large army encamped on Blackheath.</QUOTE> This fact would seem by itself sufficient to prove that he was not a vile republican and communist of the Parisian type. 
   <P>Neither the house now bearing the sign of the <QUOTE>White Hart,</QUOTE> nor its immediate predecessor, which was pulled down a few years ago, can lay claim to being the same building that afforded shelter to Jack Cade; for in <datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct> the back part of the old inn was accidentally burnt down, and the tavern was wholly destroyed by the great fire of Southwark, in <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>. <QUOTE>It appears, however,</QUOTE> says Mr. John Timbs, <QUOTE>to have been rebuilt upon the model of the older edifice, and realised the descriptions which we read of the ancient inns, consisting of <num value="1">one</num> or more open courts or yards, surrounded with open galleries, and which were frequently used as temporary theatres for acting plays and dramatic performances in the olden time.</QUOTE> 
   <P> <QUOTE>There are in London,</QUOTE> writes Charles Dickens, in his inimitable <QUOTE>Pickwick Papers,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>several old inns, once the head-quarters of celebrated coaches in the days when coaches performed their journeys in a graver and more solemn manner than they do in these times; but which have now degenerated into little more than the abiding and booking places of country wagons. The reader would look in vain for any of these ancient hostelries among the <Q>Golden Crosses</Q> and  <Q> Bull and Mouths,</Q>  <pb id="P.87" n="87"> which rear their stately fronts in the improved streets of London. If he would light upon any of these old places, he must direct his steps to the obscurer quarters of the town; and there in some secluded nooks he will find several, still standing with a kind of gloomy sturdiness amidst the modern innovations which surround them. In the Borough especially there still remain some half-dozen old inns, which have preserved their external features unchanged, and which have escaped alike the rage for public improvement and the encroachments of private speculation.   Great, rambling, queer old places they are, with galleries, and passages, and staircases wide enough and antiquated enough to furnish materials for a <num value="100">hundred</num> ghost stories, supposing we should ever be reduced to the lamentable necessity of inventing any, and that the world should exist long enough to exhaust the innumerable veracious legends connected with old London Bridge and its adjacent neighbourhood on the Surrey side.</QUOTE> It is in the yard of <num value="1">one</num> of these inns--of <num value="1">one</num> no less celebrated than the <QUOTE>White Hart</QUOTE> --that our author <num value="1">first</num> introduces to the reader's notice Sam Weller, in the character of <QUOTE>boots.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The yard,</QUOTE> proceeds the novelist, <QUOTE>presented none of that bustle and activity which are the usual characteristics of a large coach inn. <num value="3">Three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> lumbering wagons, each with a pile of goods beneath its ample canopy, about the height of the <num value="2">second</num>-floor window of an ordinary house, were stowed away beneath a lofty roof which extended over <num value="1">one</num> end of the yard; and another, which was probably to commence its journey that morning, was drawn out into the open space. A double tier of bedroom galleries, with old clumsy balustrades, ran round <num value="2">two</num> sides of the straggling area, and a double row of bells to correspond, sheltered from the weather by a little sloping roof, hung over the door leading to the bar and coffeeroom. <num value="2">Two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> gigs and chaise-carts were wheeled up under different little sheds and penthouses; and the occasional heavy tread of a carthorse, or rattling of a chain at the further end of the yard, announced to anybody who cared about the matter that the stable lay in that direction. When we add that a few boys in smock-frocks were lying asleep on heavy packages, woolpacks, and other articles that were scattered about on heaps of straw, we have described as fully as need be the general appearance of the yard of the  <Q>White Hart Inn,</Q>  High Street, Borough, on the particular morning in question.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Another celebrated inn in the High Street was the <QUOTE>Boar's Head,</QUOTE> which formed a part of Sir  John Falstolf's benefactions to Maegdalen College at Oxford.   Sir John Falstolf<NOTE>This Sir John Falstolf is not to be confounded-though often confounded--ith Shakespeare's Falstaff.</NOTE>v   was <num value="1">one</num> of the bravest of English generals in the French wars, under Henry IV. and his successors.   The premises are said to have comprised a narrow court of <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> houses, but they were removed in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>   to   make the approach to New   London  Bridge.   We learn from   Mr. C. J. Palmer's <QUOTE>Perlustration of Great Yarmouth,</QUOTE> that the Falstolf family had their town residence in Southwark, nearly opposite to the Tower of London, and that the <QUOTE>Boar's Head Inn</QUOTE> was the property of Sir John Falstolf.   Henry Windesone, in a letter to John Paston, dated <datestruct VALUE="1459-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1459">1459</year></datestruct>, says, <QUOTE>An it please you to remember my master (Sir John Falstolf) at your best leisure, whether his old promise shall stand as touching my preferring to the  <Q> Boar's Head,</Q>  in Southwark.   Sir, I would have been at another place, and of my master's own motion he said that I should set up in the  <Q> Boar's Head.</Q> </QUOTE> In the churchwardens' account for St. Olave's, Southwark, in <datestruct value="1614--"><year reg="1614">1614</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1615--"><year reg="1615">1615</year></datestruct>, the house is thus mentioned :-- <QUOTE>Received of John Barlowe, that dwelleth at ye  <Q>Boar's Head</Q>  in Southwark, for suffering the encroachment at the corner of the wall in ye Flemish Church-yard for <num value="1">one</num> yeare, iiijs.</QUOTE> 
   <P>There is in existence a rare small brass token of the <QUOTE>Boar's Head;</QUOTE> on <num value="1">one</num> side is a boar's head, with a lemon in its mouth, surrounded by the words, <QUOTE><emph rend=caps>At the  <Q>Boar's Head;</Q> </emph></QUOTE> and on the other side, <QUOTE><emph rend=caps>in Southwark</emph>, <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Mr. John Timbs, in his <QUOTE>Autobiography,</QUOTE> says: <QUOTE>Of a modern-built house, nearly opposite the east end of St. Saviour's Church, my father and brother had a long tenancy, though the place has better claim to mention as being <num value="1">one</num> of the ancient inns, the  <Q>Boar's Head,</Q>  Southwark, and the property of Sir John Fastolf, of Caistor, Norfolk, and of Southwark, and who had a large house in Stoney Lane, St. Olave's. Sir John was a man of military renown, having been in the French wars of Henry VI., and was Governor of Normandy; he was also a man of letters and learning, and at the instance of his friend, William Waynfleet, Bishop of Winchester, the founder of Magdalen College, Oxford, Sir John Fastolf gave the  <Q> Boar's Head</Q>  and other possessions   towards the   foundation.      In   the 
<title lang=la>Reliquiae Hearnianae</title>, edited by Dr. Bliss, is the following entry relative to this bequest:  <Q><datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, <datestruct VALUE="-06-2"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=2>2</day></datestruct>.-The reason why they cannot give so good an account of the benefaction of Sir John Fastolf to Magd. Coll. is, because he gave it to the founder, and left it to his management, so that &lsquo;tis <pb id="P.88" n="88"> suppos'd &lsquo;twas swallow'd up in his own estate that he settled upon the college.   However, the college knows this, that the <Q>Boar's Head,</Q> in   Southwark, which was then an inn, and still retains the name, tho&lsquo; divided into   several tenements   (which brings the college <measure value="150l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="150">150</num></measure> per annum), was part of Sir John's gift.</Q>  The property above mentioned was for many years leased to the father of the writer, and was by him principally sub-let to weekly tenants. The premises were named  <Q> Boar's   Head Court,</Q>  and consisted of <num value="2">two</num> rows of tenements, <hi rend=italics>vis-a-vis</hi>, and <num value="2">two</num> houses at the east end, with a gallery outside the <num value="1">first</num> floor of the latter.   The tenements were fronted with strong weatherboard, and the balusters of the staircases were of great age.   The court entrance was between the houses Nos. <num value="25">25</num> and <num value="26">26</num> east side of High Street, and that number of houses from old London Bridge; and beneath the whole extent of the court was a finely-vaulted cellar, doubtless the wine-cellar of the    <Q>Boar's Head.</Q>  The property was cleared away in making the approaches to new London Bridge; and on this site was subsequently built part of the new front of St. Thomas's Hospital.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The <QUOTE>White Lion,</QUOTE> which formerly stood at the south end of St. Margaret's Hill, nearly opposite the <QUOTE>Tabard Inn,</QUOTE> was in its latter days, as we have already seen, a prison <QUOTE>for felons and other notorious malefactors.</QUOTE> Stow, writing in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, says, <QUOTE>The  <Q>White Lion</Q>  is a gaol, so called for that the same was a common hostelrie for the receipt of travellers by that sign. This house was <num value="1">first</num> used as a gaol within these <num value="40">forty</num> years last past.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1640--"><year reg="1640">1640</year></datestruct>, as Laud tells us in his <QUOTE>History of his Troubles,</QUOTE> the rabble apprentices released the whole of the prisoners in the <QUOTE>White Lion.</QUOTE> The place is mentioned in records of the reign of  Henry VIII. as having belonged to the Priory of  St. Mary Overy. 
   <P>Henry VIII., as we all know, in spite of his cruelty, lust, and tyranny, was a favourite sign among hostelries both in London and up and down the country. <QUOTE>Only <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num> years ago,</QUOTE> writes Mr. J. Larwood, in <datestruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>there still remained a well-painted half-length portrait of Bluff Harry as the sign of the  <Q>King's Head</Q>  before a public-house in Southwark. His personal appearance doubtless, more than his character as a king, was at the bottom   of this popular favour. He looked the personification of jollity and good cheer; and when the evil passions expressed by his face were lost under the clumsy brush of the sign-painter, there remained nothing but a merry  <Q> beery-looking</Q>  Bacchus, well adapted for a public-house sign.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Another ancient inn bore the sign of the <QUOTE><num value="3">Three</num>    Tuns;</QUOTE> all that is known of it, however, is that it formed <num value="1">one</num> of the favourite resorts of the Philanthropic Harmonists. 
     <P><hi rend=italics>Apropos</hi> of these old inns in the Borough, we may add that Mr. Larwood tells us that in <datestruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct> the <QUOTE>Sun and Hare,</QUOTE> a carved stone sign, stil existed, walled up in the fagade of a house here. 
     <P>Many of these inns had a religious, or <hi rend=italics>quasi-</hi>
religious character. Such was the hostelry which bore the sign of the <QUOTE><num value="3">Three</num> Brushes,</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>Holywater Sprinklers,</QUOTE> in allusion to the brushes used at the <QUOTE>Asperges,</QUOTE> in the commencement of high mass in the Catholic Church. This house stood near the White Lion Prison. It had in it a room with a richly-panelled wainscot, and a ceiling ornamented with the arms of Queen Elizabeth. Probably it had been a court-room for the <QUOTE>justices</QUOTE> at the time when the <QUOTE>White Lion</QUOTE> was used as a prison. Its existence is proved by tokens of <num value="1">one</num> <QUOTE>Robert Thornton, haberdasher, next the  <Q><num value="3">Three</num>   Brushes,</Q>  in Southwark, <datestruct value="1667--"><year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Between Union Street and Mint Street, opposite St. George's Church, and on the site where now stands the booking-office of the Midland Railway  Goods Dep<num value="6">6</num>t, stood, till about the year <datestruct value="1870"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>, an old and well-known inn, called <QUOTE>The Catherine  Wheel.</QUOTE> It was a famous inn for carriers during the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> and eighteenth centuries. <QUOTE>The   <Q>Catherine Wheel,</Q> </QUOTE> writes Mr. Larwood, <QUOTE>was formerly a very common sign, most likely adopted from its being the badge of the order of the knights of St. Catherine of Mount Sinai, formed in the year <datestruct value="1063"><year reg="1063">1063</year></datestruct>, for the protection of pilgrims on their way to and from the Holy Sepulchre. Hence it was a suggestive, if not an eloquent, sign for an inn, as it intimated that the host was of the brotherhood, although in a humble way, and would protect the traveller from robbery in his inn--in the shape of high charges and exactions-just as the knights of St. Catherine protected them on the high road from robbery by brigands.   These knights wore a white habit embroidered with a Catherine-wheel 
 <hi rend=italics>(i.e</hi>., a wheel armed with spikes), and traversed with a sword, stained with blood. There were also mysteries in which St. Catherine played a favourite part, <num value="1">one</num> of which was acted by young ladies on the entry of Queen Catherine of Aragon (queen to our Henry VIII.) in London in <datestruct value="1501--"><year reg="1501">1501</year></datestruct>.   In honour of this queen the sign may occasionally have been put up. The Catherine-wheel was also a charge in the Turners' arms. Flecknoe tells us in his <title>Enigmatical Characters</title> (<datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>), that the  Puritans changed it into the Cat and Wheel, under which it is still to be seen on a public-house at Castle Green, Bristol.</QUOTE> <pb id="P.89" n="89"> 

 
<P>Another inn, called the <QUOTE><num value="3">Three</num> Widows,</QUOTE> was probably a perversion of the <QUOTE><num value="3">Three</num> Nuns</QUOTE> --the ignorant people after the Reformation confounding the white head-dresses of the religious sisterhood with those of disconsolate relicts.   Here, <QUOTE>at the  <Q><num value="3">Three</num> Widows,</Q>  in Southwark,</QUOTE> a foreigner, Peter Treviris, in the early part of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, set up a printing-press, which he kept constantly at work for several years, as we learn from the titlepages of his books. 
   <P>Among the quaint old signs which prevailed along this road, Mr. Larwood mentions <num value="1">one</num> not generally known, <QUOTE>The Old Pick my Toe,</QUOTE> which he suggests was <QUOTE>a vulgar representation of the Roman slave who, being sent on a message of importance, would not stop to pick even a thorn out of his foot by the way.</QUOTE> This curious sign, Mr. Larwood further tells us, is represented on a trade-token issued by <num value="1">one</num> Samuel Bovery in George Lane.<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.89.1">White Bear Tavern, Southwark</LEMMA></NOTE> 
    <P>From the fact of Southwark being the chief seat of our early theatres, its houses of entertainment were very numerous, in addition to the old historic inns which abounded in the High Street. <QUOTE>In the  Beaufoy collection,</QUOTE> writes Mr. John Timbs, <QUOTE>are several tokens of Southwark taverns: among them those of the  <Q>Bore's (Boar's) Head,</Q>  <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>; the   <Q>Dogg and Ducke,</Q>  St. George's Fields, <datestruct value="1651--"><year reg="1651">1651</year></datestruct>; the   <Q>Green Man,</Q>  still remaining in Blackman Street; the  <Q>Bull Head</Q>  Tavern, <datestruct value="1667--"><year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct> (mentioned   by  Edmund Alleyne, the founder of Dulwich College, as <num value="1">one</num> of his resorts); the  <Q>Duke of Suffolk's  Head,</Q>  <datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>; and the <Q>Swan with <num value="2">Two</num> Necks</Q>--properly  <Q> Nicks.</Q> </QUOTE>

For this ground, which adjoined the wall of the monastery, we read that the prior appointed a payment by the almoner to the cellarer, of Ios. <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> annually, on the feast of St. Michael; and this almery, like the parent monastery, was exempt from all episcopal jurisdiction.   After the priory church of St. Mary Overy had been repaired, and the canons had returned thither, the   temporary building above mentioned, which stood within the precincts of the Priory of Bermondsey, was assigned for the use of the poor, and the support of certain brethren and sisters.   In <datestruct value="1228--"><year reg="1228">1228</year></datestruct> this hospital of St. Mary Overy was transferred from   the land belonging to the priory to that of Amicius, Arch. deacon of Surrey, who was custos, or warden, of the hospital founded by the monks of Bermondsey, which had the advantage of a better supply of spring water, and pure air; and the <num value="2">two</num> institutions being united, the hospital was dedicated anew to the celebrated Archbishop of Canterbury, under the title of the <QUOTE>Hospital of St. Thomas the Martyr.</QUOTE> The new arrangement took place under the auspices of Peter de Rupibus, Bishop of Winchester, who granted an indulgence for <num value="20">twenty</num> days to all such as should contribute to the expenses of the hospital, the bishop himself becoming a benefactor to it; hence it was always accounted as a foundation of the bishops of Winchester, and the prelates of that see had the patronage of it. 
   <P>At the Dissolution, this hospital, or almery, was surrendered to the king. At this time its members were a master and <num value="6">six</num> brethren, and <num value="3">three</num> lay sisters. They made <num value="40">forty</num> beds for poor infirm people, who also had victuals and firing supplied to them. The institution, however, was suffered to go to decay; but in <datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>, Ridley, Bishop of London, <pb id="P.90" n="90"> by a well-timed sermon, preached before King Edward VI., awakened the benevolence of his disposition. The young king consulted with him how he should commence some great charitable institutions, and by his advice, addressed a letter to the mayor and corporation of London, announcing his intention, and requiring their advice. After some consultation, at which the bishop assisted, <num value="3">three</num> different institutions were suggested, which at length produced Christ's Hospital, for the education of youth; Bridewell, for the poor, and correcting the profligate; and this of St. Thomas, for the relief of the lame and sick. 
   <P>The citizens of London purchased the <LEMMA id="lemma.90.1">old building</LEMMA>, and after having repaired and enlarged it, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.090" n="2000.14.0035"><HEAD>St. Thomas's Hospital, <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 opened it for the reception of the sick poor, under the patronage of the young king.   In the course of <num value="4">four</num> months after the purchase of the hospital, the institution had received no less than <num value="260">260</num> poor infirm people. In the following year a charter of incorporation was granted for this foundation; but <num value="7">seven</num> years afterwards the hospital was so poor that the lease was pawned for <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure>.   Funds, however, were obtained for its support, and the establishment subsequently throve. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1664--"><year reg="1664">1664</year></datestruct>, part of St. Thomas's Hospital was used as a military hospital, as we learn from the following entry in John Evelyn's <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date of <datestruct VALUE="-12-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct> of that year:-- <QUOTE>We deliver'd the Privy Council letters to the Governors of St. <pb id="P.91" n="91"> Thomas's Hospital, in Southwark, that a moiety of the house should be reserv'd for such sick and wounded as should from time to time be sent from the Fleete during the war.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Much injury was done to the property belonging to this establishment by the fires which, as already stated, took place in Southwark in the Stuart times, although the hospital itself received no damage on either occasion. However, towards the close of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century the building had become so much decayed that a public subscription was made in order to re-edify and enlarge it, and the <num value="1">first</num> stone of the new edifice was laid by Sir John Fleet, who was Lord Mayor of London in <datestruct value="1692--"><year reg="1692">1692</year></datestruct>. The whole was executed at different times, and the work was not completed till the year <datestruct value="1732"><year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct>.

    <P>Through the <num value="1">first</num> court is the entrance to the <num value="2">second</num>, by a descent of steps. This court has a Doric colonnade with a cornice, on which is the basement to <num value="9">nine</num> pilasters. On the north side is the chapel for the use of the patients, in which service is performed daily; on the south, the parish church; on the east, the hall, elevated on Tuscan columns, with   compartments   for the   chaplain, treasurer, steward, &amp;c.; in the north-east corner is the kitchen. The court-room is over the colonnade. 
    <P>The <num value="3">third</num> court is surrounded by a colonnade of the Tuscan order, with an   entablature, from which ascends a long range of pilasters of the Ionic order.   In the centre is a statue of Sir Robert Clayton, in his robes as Lord   Mayor, with the following inscription, in Latin and in English:-- 
   <QUOTE REND=blockquote>To Sir <name rend=caps>Robert Clayton</name>, Klt., born in Northamptonshire, Citizen and Lord Mayor of London, President of this Hospital, and Vice President of the new Workhouse, and a bountiful benefactor to it; a just Magistrate, and brave Defender of the Liberty and Religion of his Country; who (besides many other instances of his charity to the poor) built <pb id="P.92" n="92"> the Girls' Ward in Christ's Hospital; gave <num value="1">first</num> toward the rebuilding of this house   <measure value="600l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="600">600</num></measure>; and left by his last Will <measure value="2300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2300">2,300</num></measure> to the poor of it.

    <P>Northouck tells us that the reason why this fire was so wide in its devastation was the fact that the houses there were chiefly built of timber, lath, and plaster; he adds that afterwards commissioners were appointed for rebuilding them regularly and substantially with brick, <QUOTE>as now   (<datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>) appears from the Bridge-foot up to St. Margaret's Hill beyond it.</QUOTE> 
   <P>There were at the above period <num value="20">twenty</num> wards for the reception of patients, each under the care of a sister or female superintendent, and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> nurses. The number of beds was <num value="485">485</num>. The grand entrance, with its gates, lodges, &amp;c., was from Wellington Street, between the north and south wings. In front was a dwarf stone wall, surmounted by lofty and massive iron railings, which were carried on and flanked the north side of the north wing, running along Duke Street, up to the offices of the South-Eastern Railway. 
   <P>Imposing as the building was, it seems to have had its drawbacks; for we read in a topographical account of it published many years ago, that <QUOTE>The magnitude of St. Thomas's Hospital, with the relief of its many colonnades, will not permit us wholly to exclude the character of the edifice from a species of grandeur. But it is time to rebuild this hospital in a better style; and with this improvement might commence a system   of decorating the borough of Southwark and its vicinity, which at present are more than a century behind the northern bank of the river in the progress of refinement; and to this it may be added, that if the practice of wholly surrounding a space with buildings, so as to stagnate the air within the quadrangle, is as unhealthy as we deem it to be, no plan can be so unfit for an hospital as an accumulation of courts behind each other.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Of the <QUOTE>inner life</QUOTE> of St. Thomas's Hospital we shall have more to say when we reach Lambeth, where the institution is now located. But we may add here that it is <num value="1">one</num> of the oldest hospitals in the kingdom as an asylum where all sick poor could be relieved. Its charter dates from the time of Edward VI., who gave it some of its lands, which were then of such little value that--as we have shown above--the whole freehold was pawned to the City for <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure>, for the hospital was then in debt, as it had been ever since it was <num value="1">first</num> founded, in <datestruct value="1213--"><year reg="1213">1213</year></datestruct>, by <QUOTE>ye Priore of Bermondseye.</QUOTE> How the value of land has increased at that spot near  London Bridge since then need not be told, beyond saying that some was sold by the hospital about the year <datestruct value="1865"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct> at the rate of <measure value="55000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="55000">55,000</num></measure> per acre, and some a little later at the rate of <measure value="70000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="70000">70,000</num></measure>   an acre.  St. Thomas's, too, was made in the olden time into a distinct parish, and had peculiar rights of its own.  Still, ancient possession and modern usefulness proved no adequate bar to the march of that universal leveller--the railway.   The site was wanted, and the site was taken; certainly at a very heavy price--nearly <measure value="300000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300000">300,000</num></measure>.   When thus <QUOTE>disestablished,</QUOTE> the choice of the hospital authorities for a new site was rather limited. It was felt necessary that the new building should be on the south side of the water; that it should be in the midst of a poor neighbourhood, to the wants of which it could administer; and that, above all, it should have a certain amount of open space around it. This latter was a difficult desideratum, and while waiting a choice, St. Thomas's Hospital, its patients, and its staff were located in the music-hall which stands in the midst of what was once the Surrey Zoological Gardens at Kennington. Fortunately, at this time the southern Thames Embankment was being made, and the necessities of its construction compelled a considerable reclamation from the slimy foreshore of the river opposite the Houses of Parliament. The advantages of this site were instantly seen, and about <num value="8">eight</num> and a half acres were bought by the hospital from the Board of Works for about <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure>.   On this land the new hospital has been built.   The south wing of the old hospital has been left standing, and has been converted into a chapel. <pb id="P.93" n="93"> 
    <P>On the north side of St. Thomas's Street-the <num value="1">first</num> turning from the High Street southward of the London Bridge Station-stands <LEMMA id="lemma.93.1">St. Thomas's Church</LEMMA>.   It is a donative, in the gift of the governors of St. Thomas's Hospital, the church having been originally part of the hospital-as, indeed, it continued down to the time of the removal of the hospital as above mentioned-forming a part of the south side of it. The old church having become ruinous and dilapidated, it was rebuilt early in the last century, at an expense of <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure> granted out of the coal duty, with the further assistance of the governors and others. The present edifice is a plain and unsightly building of red brick, with stone dressings, of a nondescript character, having a square tower in <num value="3">three</num> storeys attached to the south side. In the south side of the church, which is open to the street, are <num value="4">four</num> lofty circular arched windows, the key-stones of which are carved with cherubim; its elevation is finished with an attic over a cornice; in the centre is a pediment. The ground-floor of the tower forms a porch to the church. The interior of the church is exceedingly plain. The altar-screen is composed of oak, and encircled with Corinthian pilasters, surmounted by their entablature and a segmental pediment. This is crowned by <QUOTE>the royal arms of George I., and over them a crest; on the side pilaster is the lion and unicorn; the whole executed in dark oak.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Gerard Johnson, a Hollander, who made the monumental bust and tomb of Shakespeare in Stratford-on-Avon Church, lived in the parish of St. Thomas, as ascertained by Mr. Peter Cunningham and Mr. J. O. Halliwell. Dugdale assures us that Gerard Johnson must often have <hi rend=italics>seen</hi>
Shakespeare. 
   <P>On the south side of St. Thomas's Street, and covering a large space of ground, stands Guy's Hospital-perhaps the noblest institution in London founded by <num value="1">one</num> man. It was founded, along with other charities, by an eccentric but philanthropic individual, Thomas Guy, a bookseller of London, of whom we have spoken in a previous volume, in our account of the Stock Exchange.<NOTE>See Vol. I., p. <num value="474">474</num>.</NOTE>
The son of a lighterman and coaldealer, he was born in Horselydown, Southwark, in <datestruct value="1645--"><year reg="1645">1645</year></datestruct>. He was apprenticed to a bookseller in Cheapside, and having been admitted a freeman of the Stationers' Company in <datestruct value="1668--"><year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>, was received into their livery in <datestruct value="1673--"><year reg="1673">1673</year></datestruct>. He began business with a stock of about <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure>, in the house which, till about the year <datestruct value="1834"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, formed the angle between Cornhill and Lombard  Street, but which was pulled down for the improvements then made in that neighbourhood.   His <num value="1">first</num> success was owing to the great demand for  English Bibles printed in Holland, in which he dealt largely; but on the importation of these being stopped by law, he contracted with the University of Oxford for the privilege of printing Bibles; and having furnished himself with types from Holland, carried on this branch of business for many years, with great profit. 
    <P>It has been stated by other writers, and also in the previous volume of this work, referred to above, that whatever foundation he might have laid for his future wealth, in the usual course of trade, no small portion of his property arose from his purchase of seamen's tickets. These, it is asserted, he bought at a large discount, and afterwards subscribed in the South Sea Company, which was established in <datestruct value="1710--"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct>, for the purpose of discharging those tickets, and giving a large interest. Here, it is added, Mr. Guy was so extensively, as well as cautiously, concerned that in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct> he was possessed of <measure value="45500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="45500">45,500</num></measure> stock, by disposing of which when it bore an extremely advanced price, he realised a considerable sum. But Charles Knight, in his <QUOTE>Shadows of the Old Booksellers,</QUOTE> has shown good reasons for believing that seamen's tickets were not in use after Thomas Guy was out of his apprenticeship, and that therefore we must look to his sale of Bibles as the real basis of his wealth. 
   <P> <QUOTE>With regard to the South Sea Stock,</QUOTE> observes a writer in the <title>Saturday Magazine</title> in <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>Mr. Guy had no hand in framing or conducting that scandalous fraud; he obtained the stock when low, and had the good sense to sell it at the time it was at its height. Never, indeed, can we approve of that speculative spirit which leads men to step out of the line of a particular calling, and to  <Q><hi rend=italics>make haste</hi> to be rich;</Q>  nor, while we admire the <hi rend=italics>mode</hi>
in which a fortune has been spent, and contemplate some splendid endowment that has derived its origin from the <Q>bad success</Q> of gambling or avarice, can we be so far misled as to allow that the end justifies the means. Gay, who, under the form   of a fable, often couched just and biting satire, alluding to the large fortunes suddenly made by means of the  <Q>South Sea Bubble,</Q>  remarks-- 
         <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>How many saucy airs we meet,

   <P>Being a single man, Mr. Guy is reported to have spent but a very small portion of his profits as a <pb id="P.94" n="94"> bookseller. He dined on his counter, with no other tablecloth than a newspaper, and was not more nice about his wearing apparel. <QUOTE>For the application of this fortune to charitable uses,</QUOTE> says Highmore, in his <QUOTE>History of the Public Charities of London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>the public are indebted to a trifling circumstance. He employed a female servant, whom   he had agreed to marry.   Some days previous to the intended ceremony, he had ordered the pavement before his door to be mended up to a particular stone which he had marked, and then left his house on business. The servant, in his absence, looking at the workmen, saw a broken stone beyond this mark which they had not repaired, and on pointing to it with that design, they acquainted her that Mr. Guy had not ordered them to go so far. She, however, directed it to be done, adding, with the security incidental to her expectation of soon becoming his wife,  <Q>Tell him I bade you, and he will not be angry.</Q>  But she too soon learnt how fatal it is for any <num value="1">one</num> in a dependent situation to exceed the limits of his or her authority; for her master, on his return, was enraged at finding that they had gone beyond his orders, renounced his engagement to his servant, and devoted his ample fortune to public charity.</QUOTE> Another anecdote has been related of Guy, which exhibits him in another light. He was so complete a pattern of economy, that the celebrated Vulture Hopkins once called upon him to have a lesson in the art of saving.   Being introduced into the parlour, Guy, not knowing his visitor, lighted a candle; but when Hopkins said, <QUOTE>Sir, I always thought myself perfect in the art of getting and husbanding money, but being informed that you far exceed me, I have taken the liberty of waiting upon you to be satisfied on this subject.</QUOTE> Guy replied, <QUOTE>If that is all your business, we can as well talk it over in the dark,</QUOTE> and immediately put out the candle. This was evidence sufficient for Hopkins, who acknowledged Guy to be his master, and took his leave. 
   <P>The following anecdote which has been told concerning Mr. Guy will bear repetition:-- <QUOTE>The munificent founder of Guy's Hospital was a man of very humble appearance, and of a melancholy cast of countenance. <num value="1">One</num> day, while pensively leaning over <num value="1">one</num> of the bridges, he attracted the attention and commiseration of a by-stander, who, apprehensive that he meditated self-destruction, could not refrain from addressing him with an earnest entreaty,  <Q> not to let his misfortunes tempt him to commit any rash act;</Q>  then, placing in his hand a guinea, with the delicacy of genuine benevolence, he hastily withdrew.   Guy, roused from his reverie, followed the stranger, and warmly expressed his gratitude, but assured him he was mistaken in supposing him to be either in distress of mind or of circumstances, making an earnest request to be favoured with the name of the good man, his intended benefactor.   The address was given, and they parted. Some years after, Guy, observing the name of his friend in the bankrupt list, hastened to his house; brought to his recollection their former interview; found, upon investigation, that no blame could be attached to him under his misfortunes; intimated his ability and also his full intention to serve him; entered into immediate arrangements with his creditors; and, finally, re-established him in a business which ever after prospered in his hands, and in the hands of his children's children, for many years in Newgate Street.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Thomas Guy served in several Parliaments as member for Tamworth, in Staffordshire, where his mother was born, and where he founded almshouses for poor persons, besides bestowing considerable benefactions. To Christ's Hospital he gave a perpetual annuity of <measure value="400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400">400</num></measure>, to receive, on the nomination of his trustees, <num value="4">four</num> children yearly, who must be his connections; and there are always applicants.   He left <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> to discharge poor prisoners in London, Middlesex, and Surrey, at <measure value="5l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5">5</num></measure> each, and another <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> to be distributed among poor housekeepers at the discretion of his executors.   The erection of the hospital now under notice, the earliest part of which was built by Dance, is said to have cost nearly <num value="19000">19,000</num>, the amount of the residue of Guy's personal property being stated at upwards of <measure value="219000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="219000">219,000</num></measure>. His death happened on <datestruct VALUE="1724-12-27"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=27>27</day>, <year reg=1724>1724</year></datestruct>, in the eightieth year of his age, before which he saw his hospital covered with the roof. Besides his public expenses he gave during life to many of his poor relations <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> or <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> a year, and to others money to advance them   in life; to his aged relations <measure value="870l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="870">870</num></measure> in annuities; and to his younger relations and executors the sum of <measure value="75589l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="75589">75,589</num></measure>. 
   <P>Before Guy had founded the hospital to which he gave his name, he had contributed <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> annually to St. Thomas's Hospital for <num value="11">eleven</num> years, and had erected the stately iron gate with the large houses on each side. 
   <P>It is now time to speak more of the hospital which bears his name. At the age of <num value="76">seventy-six</num> Mr. Guy procured   from   the governors of St. Thomas's Hospital the lease of a large piece of ground for a term of <num value="999">999</num> years, at a rent of <measure value="30l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30">30</num></measure> a year. Having cleared the space, which was then occupied by a number of poor dwelling-houses, he <pb id="P.95" n="95"> laid the <num value="1">first</num> stone of <LEMMA id="lemma.95.1">his new building</LEMMA> in the spring of <datestruct value="1722--"><year reg="1722">1722</year></datestruct>. He lived to see it covered in; but before the excellent institution was in full work the benevolent founder was laid in the grave; for the hospital received within its walls the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="60">sixty</num> patients on the <datestruct VALUE="1725-01-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>. His trustees faithfully effected the completion of his great and good design, and shortly after procured an Act of Parliament for establishing the foundation, according to the directions of his will. Large and profitable estates were afterwards purchased in Herefordshire and Essex, for the benefit of the institution; the lease of an additional piece of ground was also obtained, for which, with the former, the governors still pay an annual sum to St. Thomas's.   On this were erected <num value="2">two</num> handsome wings, connected by an iron railing and gates. These gates open into a square court, in the centre of which is <LEMMA id="lemma.95.2">a bronze statue of the founder</LEMMA>, by Scheemakers.   In front of the pedestal is this inscription :-- <QUOTE>Thomas Guy, sole Founder of this Hospital in his life-time, A.D. MDCCXXII.</QUOTE> On the west side of the pedestal is represented, in basso relievo, the parable of the Good Samaritan; on the south side are Mr. Guy's armorial bearings; and on the west, a representation of our Saviour healing the impotent man. 
   <P>The centre of the principal front of the hospital is of stone, and consists of a rusticated basement, in which are <num value="3">three</num> arched entrances to the quadrangle, and <num value="2">two</num> windows. This supports <num value="2">two</num> pilasters and <num value="4">four</num> Ionic columns, the intercolumniation containing <num value="3">three</num> windows and <num value="2">two</num> niches, in which are <num value="2">two</num> emblematic figures, zEsculapius, the heathen god of medicine, and Hygieia, the goddess of health, daughter of AEsculapius. The tympanum is ornamented with an emblematic relief.   This front was new faced about the year <datestruct value="1778"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct>, and is, with the statues, the work of Bacon, who was a native of Southwark. Passing through the arches, the visitor enters a long corridor, on each side of which are several of the wards for the patients. The court-room, with its painted ceiling, is a handsome apartment; over the president's chair is a portrait of the founder, by Dahl. 
   <P>The chapel, in the west wing, is plainly fitted up. At the end opposite the entrance is a marble statue of Guy.   It was executed by Bacon, in <datestruct value="1779--"><year reg="1779">1779</year></datestruct>, and is said to have cost <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure>.   Mr. Guy is represented in his livery gown, holding out <num value="1">one</num> hand to raise a poor invalid lying on the earth, and pointing with the other to a distressed object, carried on a litter into <num value="1">one</num> of the wards, the hospital being in the background. On the pedestal is this inscription:--

 <LB>Citizen of London, Member of Parliament, and the sole 
            <LB>founder of this hospital in his life-time. 
<LB>It is peculiar to this beneficent man to have preserved, 
     <LB>during a long course of prosperity and industry, in 
          <LB>pouring forth to the wants of others, all 
               <LB>that he had earned by labour,

<LB>Warm with philanthropy, and exalted by charity, his mind 
     <LB>expanded to those noble affections which grow but 
          <LB>too rarely from the most elevated pursuits. 
<LB>After administering with extensive bounty to the claims of 
    <LB>consanguinity, he established this asylum for that stage 
        <LB>of languor and disease, to which the charity of 
            <LB>others had not reached: he provided a 
                <LB>retreat for hopeless insanity, and 
                    <LB>rivalled the endowments 
                            <LB>of kings. 
    <LB>He died the <datestruct VALUE="1724-12-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1724">1724</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="80">80th</num> year

   <P>The hospital was founded for the reception of <num value="400">400</num> patients, but having been enlarged through the aid of a munificent bequest in <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, from Mr. William Hunt, of Petersham, it now contains <num value="720">720</num> beds; an additional wing having been constructed accommodating <num value="320">320</num> more patients.   The hospital buildings form an extensive and handsome range, and, with the large airing-grounds attached, occupy an area of abou.t <num value="6">six</num> acres. The administration of its affairs is under the care of <num value="60">sixty</num> governors; the treasurer being the general acting manager, and having the especial direction of the Medical School. The annual income   of the institution is about <measure value="40000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40000">40,000</num></measure>, of which nearly <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure> are available for hospital purposes. 
   <P>The ordinary medical staff consists of <num value="3">three</num> physicians and <num value="3">three</num> assistant-physicians for general medical cases;, <num value="2">two</num>   obstetric   physicians;   <num value="4">four</num> surgeons, and lthree assistant-surgeons for general surgical cases; also ophthalmic, dental, and aural surgeons; besides other professors not engaged in the care of patients, who assist as lecturers and demonstrators in the school. 
   <P>The school department comprises anatomical, pathological, and comparative anatomy museums, materia medica museum, model-room, dissectingroom, electrifying-room, chemical laboratories, library, besides every appurtenance that modern science has devised for medical institutions of the <num value="1">first</num> magnitude. Close by, a commodious theatre was erected by Dr. Edward Grainger, whose early death, in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, was a loss to the medical world. At the age   of <num value="22">twenty-two</num>, he commenced here a course of lectures on anatomy and physiology; but his pupils increasing beyond the capacities of his <pb id="P.96" n="96"> theatre, he built a larger room, and turned the former into a museum. 
   <P>Passing to the rear of the hospital buildings, amidst trees which flourish well and give a look of cheerfulness, so delightful to many a languid sufferer when permitted to walk forth into the air, the visitor reaches the museum.   This is a neat edifice, comprising a valuable surgical collection, the principal feature of which is a vast variety of wax models, illustrative of the wonders of the human frame, and of remarkable cases of disease. 
   <P>Guy's Hospital, we need scarcely add, has long held a prominent position among the philanthropic institutions in this country, both in respect to the great scope of the charity it dispenses as a hospital, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.096" n="2000.14.0037"><HEAD>Folly Ditch, Jacob's Island   (See Next Chapter).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 and as <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> schools of medicine in Europe.   Some idea of the magnitude of its benevolent work may be gathered from the fact that in the course of a year it receives into its wards upwards of <num value="5000">5,000</num> in-patients, and affords medical relief to upwards of <num value="70000">70,000</num> out-patients, including a large number of minor accidents and urgent surgery cases, and upwards of <num value="2000">2,000</num> lying--in women, who are attended to at their own homes. 
   <P>It should also be stated that a fund has been established for relieving the families of deserving and very poor patients in Guy's Hospital, by gifts of coal and other provisions, and in some instances by money.

    <P>Between St. Thomas's Street East and Tooley  Street, and covering some considerable part of the ground formerly occupied by St. Thomas's Hospital, is the cluster of stations, irregularly combined, and without any unity of plan or architectural beauty, forming the terminus of the following railways:--  The Crystal Palace; the London, Brighton, and  South Coast; the South-Eastern; the North Kent; the South London, &amp;c. From London Bridge the approach is by an inclined road, which passes under an iron bridge, over which is carried the  Cannon Street and Charing Cross extension of the  South-Eastern Railway, which originally had its terminus here.   The approach, previous to the above-mentioned extension, was bounded on the south-west by St. Thomas's Hospital and grounds, and on the north-east by a range of shops, communicating with Tooley Street. The south-western portion of the station comprises the booking-offices of the Brighton and South-Coast line, and also the offices of the Crystal Palace and of the South  London lines.   On the extreme south is the Railway Hotel, <num value="1">one</num> of those monster establishments of which we have already had occasion to speak in our notices of the Midland and other railway stations. 
   <P>The London and Greenwich Railway was the <num value="1">first</num> line opened here, and, indeed, in the neighbourhood of London.   It is remarkable as standing upon <num value="1">one</num> continuous series of <num value="878">878</num> brick arches, and is interesting to engineers from the experiment tried upon it as regards the respective value of stone sleepers (or square slabs) at intervals, or continuous bearers of wood, for the support of the rail. Stones were <num value="1">first</num> used, but with such unsatisfactory result, that they were taken up and replaced with timber. The improvement, it is said, has been most decisive.   With reference to its formation, we read that in <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct> the substructions of this work were advancing rapidly, and so great was the quantity of bricks required for them, that the price of brickwork in and about London had been <QUOTE>materially affected by this extraordinary consumption of that material.</QUOTE> At <num value="1">first</num>, the <num value="3">third</num>-class carriages on this line were simply common trucks, with no seats, and no covering overhead.   The author of the <QUOTE>Wonders of Nature and Art</QUOTE> writes, <QUOTE>We have anticipated this line to be a failure, unless it be extended to Dover, in which case an immense advantage would be secured to the public. Colonel Landmann. the engineer, estimated the cost at <measure value="400000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400000">400,000</num></measure>, but the expenditure thus far has exceeded   <measure value="600000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="600000">600,000</num></measure>, and a considerable sum is still required in order to complete it.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The original Act of the South-Eastern Railway  Company was obtained in <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>, for the express purpose of constructing a railway from London to  Dover, the expenses of which were calculated at  <measure value="1400000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1400000">1,400,000</num></measure>, to be raised in <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> shares; but by subsequent Acts the company was authorised to form branch lines, and for that purpose to make loans and issue new shares, involving for the Maidstone and Isle of Thanet branches an expenditure of <measure value="3564170l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3564170">3,564,170</num></measure>; besides which there has been a further outlay of about <measure value="1800000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1800000">1,800,000</num></measure>, to complete the Hastings branch and that from Reigate, through  Dorking and Guildford, to Reading. 
   <P>The Greenwich Line, as stated above, had been previously constructed; and the Croydon Company had obtained the sanction of Parliament to pass over <num value="3">three</num> miles thereof to New Cross, whence they continued their line <num value="7">seven</num> miles and a half to Croydon. The next <num value="10">ten</num> miles and a quarter, as far as Red Hill, or the Reigate Junction, belonged originally to the South-Eastern and Brighton Companies in joint shares; but the whole has subsequently, as sanctioned by Act of Parliament, been purchased by the South-Eastern Company; so that the whole line, together with the Greenwich Line, which it holds on a lease of <num value="999">999</num> years, belongs to this company. More recently, also, besides constructing several branch lines, the South-Eastern Company has purchased the North Kent Line, thus becoming master of the whole railway communication for Kent, East Surrey, and a part of Sussex. 
   <P>The railway was opened as far as Tunbridge, <num value="40">forty</num> miles from   London, in <datestruct VALUE="1842-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>; from thence to Ashford in the following December; as far as Folkestone in <datestruct VALUE="1843-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>; and to Dover in <datestruct VALUE="1844-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>. The branch line to Maidstone was opened in September of the same year; that to Hastings, in <datestruct VALUE="1852-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>; and the junction line to Reading in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>. This railway has <num value="7">seven</num> tunnels on its main line to Dover, and <num value="4">four</num> on its branch lines, some of them of a stupendous nature, involving not only very great engineering skill, but a vast outlay of capital; besides which, there are numerous embankments, deep cuttings, viaducts, and bridges, which bespeak no ordinary skill. Since <datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>, however, the greater number of the main-line trains to Hastings, Dover, Margate, &amp;c., pass over a part of the North Kent Line by a more direct route to Tunbridge; the original main line to Red Hill being used for the Dorking and Reading trains, as well as by the Brighton Company. <pb id="P.99" n="99"> 
    <P>The construction of the London and Brighton  Railway seems to have been a somewhat slow and laborious undertaking; at all events, we read in <QUOTE>Wonders of Nature and Art,</QUOTE> <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>, that- <QUOTE>After the immense bustle in Parliament, and the shameless stock-jobbing of some of the directors and managers of this line of road, we are unable to report the progress of it. That it has been commenced and is proceeding is quite true; but it is proceeding slowly, and as yet the public is quite in the dark as to its present expenditure and its anticipated cost.</QUOTE> This railway, however, we need hardly state, was at length completed, and opened in <datestruct VALUE="1841-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, or in about <num value="3">three</num> years from the time of its commencement. 
 <NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.99.1">Old South-Eastern Railway Station</LEMMA></NOTE>

    <P>On either side of the   booking-office of the 
 <LEMMA id="lemma.99.2">Brighton and South-Coast Railway</LEMMA>, when it was <num value="1">first</num> erected, was a screen, <num value="1">one</num> masking the gateway of the carriage-road arrival side of this railway, and the other giving access to the carriage-road of the  Dover line. The South-Eastern booking-office faces the approach road, and forms the main portion of the facade.   Beyond it are the North Kent and  Greenwich booking-offices. On the <num value="1">first</num>-floors of these several buildings are the offices, board-rooms, and other accommodations for the chief officials.  There are spare lines for the reception of empty carriages under the same roofs as the respective arrival and departure lines. The roofs themselves are somewhat remarkable; and there are particular details connected with the roadway of a nature to merit prolonged examination. Immediately in the rear of the station are several elevated signalboxes, furnished with the latest and most approved appliances for signalling the arrival and departure of the several trains; so that, notwithstanding the large number of the lines of rail entering the station there is scarcely any room for accidentsindeed, an accident here is very rarely heard of. 
   <P>A few   words concerning the various lines of railway from London Bridge Station may not be out of place here.   By the <hi rend=italics>Brighton</hi> line, <num value="51">fifty-one</num> miles in length, that favourite watering-place has been made a <QUOTE>suburb of London:</QUOTE> it has many branch lines; and from Brighton, railways run east and west along the coast.   The <hi rend=italics>South--Eastern</hi>
originally branched off from the Brighton line at the station of Red Hill, near Reigate, and reached Dover by a roundabout course, with a branch from Tunbridge through Tunbridge Wells to Hastings; but passengers are now   generally conveyed to Dover, Hastings, &amp;c., by the new line <hi rend=italics>via</hi> Sevenoaks.   The metropolitan extension of this line crosses the river by an iron bridge to Cannon Street; and also to the Charing Cross Station, built on the site of Hungerford Market. The <hi rend=italics>Croydon</hi>
passes by Forest Hill, Sydenham, and Norwood, with a short branch line through Mitcham to the South-Western Railway at Wimbledon, and another branch through Epsom to Horsham, on the London and Portsmouth line.   The <hi rend=italics>Crystal Palace</hi> line branches off from the Sydenham station, and after passing close to Lower Norwood, Streatham, and Balham, reaches its terminus at the Victoria Station, Pimlico.   The <hi rend=italics>North Kent</hi> line passes by a tunnel under Shooter's Hill to Woolwich, Gravesend, and Rochester, and thence to Maidstone. The <hi rend=italics>South London</hi> line runs parallel with the Greenwich Railway as far as South Bermondsey, then passes southward to Clapham, and unites with western London at Victoria Station, Pimlico. 
    <P>At the entrance to Duke Street--which leads from London Bridge down to Tooley Street, by the side of the railway approach-might have been seen during <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>-<num value="3">3</num>, a lofty building bearing this inscription, <QUOTE>Watson's Telegraph to the Downs.</QUOTE> This telegraph station, which occupied the summit of a building once used as a shot tower, and erected in <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>, was established by a Mr. Watson, of  Cornhill, about the year <datestruct value="1842"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>, with the object of connecting London with Deal by means of the old semaphore telegraph.   The <num value="1">first</num> station near St.  Olave's Church was placed in communication with a similar station near Forest Hill, and with others on elevated spots between the metropolis and  Deal. At the summit of the tower were <num value="2">two</num> masts about <num value="20">twenty</num> feet apart, and <num value="50">fifty</num> feet high. On each side of these masts were the semaphore arms, which were to be seen in various positions, and were worked by levers in the tower below. This telegraph station, which was a conspicuous object to foot-passengers proceeding over London Bridge, was entirely consumed in the great fire in which  St. Olave's Church was destroyed, with the surrounding buildings, on the Igth of <datestruct VALUE="1843-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>.  This system of telegraphy was in its turn superseded by the electric telegraph, which very soon afterwards came into operation on all the railway lines in Great Britain, and thus rendered unnecessary the old cumbrous system of semaphore telegraphy, the success of which depended so much on clear weather for the accurate interpretation of the signals. The shot-tower, close by St. Olave's  Church, is shown in pages <num value="6">6</num>, <num value="102">102</num>, and <num value="103">103</num> of the present volume. 
   <P>Before closing this chapter, and making our way into Bermondsey, we may be pardoned for saying a word or <num value="2">two</num> concerning the water-supply of Southwark about half a century ago. In the <hi rend=italics>Mirror</hi> for <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, we read that <QUOTE>the Southwark Water Works <pb id="P.100" n="100"> (the property of an individual) are supplied from the middle of the Thames, below Southwark and London Bridges; and the water thus taken is sent out to the tenants without standing to settle or any filtration, further than that it receives from passing through wire grates and small holes in metallic plates. The number of houses supplied by these works is about <num value="7000">7,000</num>, and the average daily supply about <num value="720000">720,000</num> gallons.</QUOTE> <hi rend=italics>Apropos</hi> of these water works, we may state that in <datestruct value="1581--"><year reg="1581">1581</year></datestruct> Peter Morris, a Dutchman, established a wheel worked by the tide at London Bridge to lift water from the river, and propel it into the houses of the citizens, whose admiration he captivated by forcing a jet over the steeple of St. Magnus' Church, close by. These water-works, a cumbrous-looking structure of wood, stood on the Middlesex side of the Thames, adjoining the bridge, and near the site of Fishmongers' Hall steam-boat pier.   The works subsequently passed into the possession of the New River Company, and lasted for <num value="240">240</num> years, until demolished by Act of Parliament in <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>. On the Surrey side of the old bridge formerly stood the water-works for supplying the inhabitants of Southwark, which we have already mentioned, but these were removed long before the bridge was demolished.

<P>In   a previous chapter of this volume we have considered the Borough High Street as the line of demarcation between the eastern and western portions of the southern suburbs of Bermondsey and   Southwark; here, then, we may fittingly separate their respective histories.   The name Bermondsey--the <QUOTE>land of leather,</QUOTE> as it has been called in our own day--is generally supposed to be derived from Beormund, the Saxon lord of the district, and <hi rend=italics>ea</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>eye</hi>, an <QUOTE>island,</QUOTE> descriptive of the locality, near the river-side, and intersected by numerous small streams and ditches; though <num value="1">one</num> antiquary has suggested, with more than ordinary rashness, that <hi rend=italics>beorn</hi> is Saxon for prince, and that 
<hi rend=italics>mund</hi> signified security or peace, so that Bermondsey may be interpreted as <QUOTE>the prince's security by the water's side.</QUOTE> Wilkinson, in his account of Bermondsey Abbey in <QUOTE>Londina Illustrata,</QUOTE> states that the words <hi rend=italics>ea</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>eye</hi>, <QUOTE>are frequent in the names of places whose situation on the banks of rivers renders them insular and marshy;</QUOTE> and the word still exists in the longer form of <QUOTE>eyot.</QUOTE> 
    <P> <QUOTE>Looking, then,</QUOTE> writes Charles Knight, <QUOTE>upon the original Bermondsey as a kind of marshy island when the tide was out, and a wide expanse of water when it was in, till gradually reclaimed and made useful, <num value="1">one</num> cannot help being struck with the many indications of the old state of things yet remaining, although the <hi rend=italics>present</hi> Bermondsey is densely covered with habitations and houses. The descent down the street leading from   London Bridge tells you how low lie the territories you are about to explore; the numerous wharves, the docks, the water-courses, the ditches, which bound and intersect so considerable a portion of it, seem but so many memorials of the once potent element; the very streets have a damp <hi rend=italics>feel</hi> about them; and in the part known as Jacob's Island the overhanging houses, and the little wooden bridges that span the stream, have, notwithstanding their forlorn look, something of a Dutch expression.   In short, persons familiar with the history of the place may everywhere see that Beormund's Ea still exists, but that it has been em banked and drained--that it has grown populous, busy, commercial.   Its manufacturing prosperity, however, strikingly contrasts with the general aspect of Bermondsey.   Its streets generally are but dreary-looking places, where, with the exception of a picturesque old tenement, projecting its storey beyond storey regularly upwards, and fast  <Q> nodding to its fall,</Q>  or the name of a street suggestive of some agreeable reflections, there is little to gratify the delicate eye. . .. .Noble arches here and there bestride the streets of Bermondsey, bearing up a railway, with its engines puffing like so many overworked giants, and its rapid trains of passengers; an elegant free school enriches <num value="1">one</num> part, and a picturesque church another; but they all serve by <pb id="P.101" n="101"> contrast to show more vividly the unpleasant features of the, neighbourhood, and, whilst they cannot but command the spectator's admiration, make him at the same time wonder how they got there.   The answer is at hand. There is great industry in Bermondsey, and the wretchedness is more on the surface than in the depth of this quarter of the town.</QUOTE> Both here, and also in the adjoining parish of Rotherhithe, extensive manufactures are carried on: in Bermondsey the tanners and ropemakers abound; at Rotherhithe, timber merchants, sawyers, and boat-builders. It would not, perhaps, be far from the truth to say that Bermondsey may be regarded not only as a region of manufactures, but as a region of market gardens, as a region of wholesale dealers, or as a maritime region, according to the quarter where we take our stand. 
    <P>Running east and   west through the parish, parallel with the river Thames, and by Dockhead, winding its way towards Rotherhithe and Greenwich, is Tooley Street, a narrow   and winding thoroughfare, which in some parts still bears many traces of its antiquity.   <num value="1">One</num> would have liked out of sheer malice to have been here to see the little gossiping Secretary of the Admiralty, Samuel  Pepys, and his friend and patron, Lord Sandwich, floundering about in these parts in <datestruct VALUE="1665-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>-<num value="6">6</num>, when, owing to the bad weather, they could not find a boat to convey them by water, and in consequence they were forced to walk. <QUOTE>Lord! what a dirty walk we had, and so strong the wind, that in the fields we many times could not carry our bodies against it, but were driven backwards. It was dangerous to walk the streets, the bricks and tiles falling from the houses, so that the whole streets were covered with them. .        . . We could see no boats in the Thames afloat but what were broke loose and carried through the bridge, it being ebbing water. And the greatest sight of all was among other parcels of ships driven hither and thither in clusters together, <num value="1">one</num> was quite overset, and lay with her masts all along in the water, and her keel above water.</QUOTE> The desolation and wintry chilliness of this picture is enough to make us shiver even in the dog-days. 
    <P>Passing onward on our journey from the foot of  London Bridge, down the steep incline of Duke  Street, which bounds the north side of the approach to the railway station, we find ourselves in Tooley Street, whose name, we are told, is a strange corruption of the former appellation, St.  Olave's Street, and whose shops exhibit a singular mixture of the features which are found separate in other parts of the district-wharfingers, merchants, salesmen, factors, and agents; outfitters, biscuit-bakers, store-shippers, ship-chandlers, slopsellers, block-makers, and rope-makers; engineers, and others, together with the usual varieties of retail tradesmen-all point to the diversified, and no less busy than diversified, traffic of this street. <QUOTE>Here,</QUOTE> it has been said truly, <QUOTE>the crane and the pulley seem never to be idle.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The parish of St. Olave is bounded on the north by the river Thames, whence it extends in an irregular line towards the Dover Road, separating Bermondsey from   Rotherhithe and Deptford parishes; it enters Bermondsey Street by Snow's Fields, and proceeds thence to St. Saviour's (once called Savory) Dock. St. Olave's, like many other parishes in the suburbs of London, having been greatly increased in the number of its inhabitants, in <datestruct value="1732--"><year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct> <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="50">fifty</num> new churches provided by the Act of Queen Anne was built for the district of Horselydown, which was made a separate parish by an Act of Parliament passed in the following year, and to which was given the name of St. John. 
   <P>The parish church of St. Olave stands on the north side of Tooley Street, near its western end; and with the exception of the south side, is concealed from   public observation.   St. Olave, or Olaf, in whose honour it is dedicated, was the son of Herald, Prince of Westford, in Norway, in which country he was celebrated for having expelled the Swedes, and for recovering Gothland. After performing these exploits he came to England, and remaining here for <num value="3">three</num> years as the ally of Ethelred, he expelled the Danes from several English cities, towns, and fortresses, and returned home laden with great spoils.   He was recalled to England by Emma of Normandy, the surviving queen of his friend, in order to assist her against Knute; but finding that a treaty had been made between that king and the English, he withdrew, and was created king of Norway by the voice of the nation. To strengthen his throne, he married the daughter of the king of Sweden; but his zeal for the Christian faith caused him to be much troubled by domestic wars, as well as by the Danes abroad; yet these he regarded not, as he plainly declared that he would rather lose his life and his kingdom than his faith in Christ.   Upon this, the men of Norway complained to Knute, king of Denmark, and afterwards of England, charging Olaf with altering their laws and customs; and he was murdered by a body of traitors and rebels near Drontheim, about A.D. <datestruct value="1029"><year reg="1029">1029</year></datestruct>.   The Bishop of Drontheim, whom he had taken with him across the sea from England in order to assist him in establishing the Christian faith in Norway, commanded that he should be <pb id="P.102" n="102"> honoured as a martyr, and invoked as a saint. He was buried at Drontheim, where his body was found uncorrupted in <datestruct value="1541--"><year reg="1541">1541</year></datestruct>, when the Lutherans plundered his shrine of its gold and jewels, for it was reckoned the greatest treasure of the Church in the north. His feast is commemorated on the <datestruct VALUE="-07-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>. Such was St. Olaf, to whose memory no less than <num value="4">four</num> churches were built in London, and rightly so, for, says Newcourt, <QUOTE>he had well deserved, and was well beloved by our English nation, as well for his friendship in assisting them against the Danes, as for his holy and Christian life.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In Alban Butler's <QUOTE>Lives of the Saints</QUOTE> will be found several interesting particulars of the life of this heroic and saintly prince. We meet with him under a variety of names, as Anlaf, Unlaf, Olaf Haraldson, Olaus, and Olaf Helge, or Olaf the Holy.   The antiquity of his church in Southwark is proved by William   Horn's <QUOTE>Chronicle of the Acts of the Abbots of St. Austin's, Canterbury</QUOTE> (printed in Roger Twisden's <QUOTE>Historie Anglicanae Scriptores Decem</QUOTE> ), who tells us that John,Earl of Warren, granted, about the year <datestruct value="1281"><year reg="1281">1281</year></datestruct>, to Nicholas, the then abbot, <QUOTE>all the estate which it held in

   <P>In <datestruct value="1736--"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct>, part of the old church having fallen down, and the rest being in an unsafe condition, owing to the graves having been dug too near the foundation, the parishioners applied to Parliament for power to rebuild it; which being granted, they were enabled to raise <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure> by granting annuities for lives, not exceeding <measure value="400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400">400</num></measure> on the whole; for payment of which a rate was to be made, not exceeding <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> in the pound, <num value="2">two</num>-thirds to be paid by the landlord, and <num value="1">one</num> by the tenant, to cease on the determination of the annuities. The new church, constructed chiefly of Portland stone, was completed in <datestruct value="1740--"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>. It has a nave, with side aisles, and a square tower, which was originally designed to be surmounted by a spire. In <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct> this church had a narrow escape from   total destruction by fire. On the    <datestruct VALUE="-08-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct> in that year, a conflagration broke out on the premises of an oilman, near the entrance of Topping's wharf (which is close by the church). which was totally destroyed, <pb id="P.103" n="103">

The fire consumed the shot tower, then lately used as Watson's Telegraph, as stated at the close of the last chapter, and afterwards caught the roof of St. Olave's Church. The flames spread rapidly, and the interior of the structure, with all the bells, was destroyed, little more than the tower and the bare walls remaining. Fortunately, the church was insured, and was speedily rebuilt. 
   <P>The plan of the body of this church is a parallelogram, divided into nave and aisles. The columns, which separate these <num value="3">three</num> compartments from each other, are fluted, of the Ionic order, with sculptured capitals, in each range <num value="4">four</num> in number. Against the eastern and western walls are also <num value="4">four</num> pilasters, corresponding with the columns.   The nave is prolonged eastwardly by a semi-circular apse, containing the altar. Over the entire nave extends a beautiful and highly-finished groined ceiling of <num value="5">five</num> divisions; in the perpendicular side of each compartment of the groining is a semi-circular headed window. The ceiling of the altar-apse is a semi-dome, forming a rich piece of gilt coffered work. The east window is of stained glass, with a central representation, in an oval, of the Lord's Supper, after Carlo Dolce. At the west end of the church is a large and handsome organ, remarkable for the richness of its tone.   This instrument, designed by Dr. Gauntlett, organist of St. Olave's, was erected at an expense of   <measure value="800l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="800">800</num></measure>; it was commenced in <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>, by Mr..

   <P>Eastward from the church is-or was till latelya quay, which in the year <datestruct value="1330"><year reg="1330">1330</year></datestruct>, by the licence of Simon Swanland, mayor of London, was built by Isabel, widow of Hammond Goodchepe. Adjoining this quay was <QUOTE>a great house of stone and timber, belonging to the Abbot of St. Augustine, Canterbury, which was an ancient piece of work, seeming to be <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> builded houses on that side of the river over against the city. It was called the Abbot's Inn of St. Augustine, in Southwark, and was held of the Earls of Warren and Surrey, as appears by a deed made in <datestruct value="1281--"><year reg="1281">1281</year></datestruct>. The house afterwards belonged to Sir Anthony St. Leger, then to Warnham   St. Leger, and is now,</QUOTE> says Stow, <QUOTE>called St. Leger House, and divided into many apartments.</QUOTE> A wharf on the site keeps in remembrance the name of this knightly'family, although by the process of time it has become corrupted into Sellinger's Wharf. 
    <P>The Abbot of Battle, an important personage as the superior of the monastery erected on the spot where the fate of Saxon England was decided, and especially patronised by the Conqueror, had a fine residence near the same spot, with well laid-out gardens, as an agreeable change from the natural beauties of hilly, leafy Sussex, adorned with parterres in Norman fashion, with a fish-pond and a curiously-contrived maze.   The abbot has gone, and the palace and gardens are gone too; and Londoners of the <num value="19">nineteenth</num> century hurry through Maze Pond, at the back of Guy's Hospital, little thinking whence the dirty street derived its name. The <QUOTE>Maze</QUOTE> --now an assemblage of small streets on the south side of the London Bridge Railway Station--is stated by Mr. Charles Knight in his <QUOTE>London,</QUOTE> to have <QUOTE>once been the garden attached to the manor-house, or  <Q>inn,</Q>  of the abbots of Battle, the house itself having stood on the north side of Tooley Street, in what is now called Mill Lane, which leads down to Battlebridge Stairs.</QUOTE> Aubrey, in his <QUOTE>Anecdotes and Traditions,</QUOTE> says, <QUOTE>At Southwark was a maze, which is now converted into buildings bearing that name;</QUOTE> but Peter Cunningham in his <QUOTE>Handbook of London,</QUOTE> says that Maze Pond is so called from the <QUOTE>Manor of Maze,</QUOTE> which formerly existed here. 
    <P>Opposite <LEMMA id="lemma.105.1">St. Olave's Church, in Tooley Street</LEMMA>, and adjoining Church Alley, which has become absorbed in the Brighton and South-Eastern Railway terminus, says Allen in his <QUOTE>History of Surrey,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>formerly stood a spacious stone building, the city residence of the Priors of Lewes, in Sussex, whenever occasion led them   to visit London or its vicinity on parliamentary or ecclesiastical duty.</QUOTE> Strype, noticing St. Olave's Church, says, <QUOTE>On the south side of the street was sometime <num value="1">one</num> great house, builded of stone, with arched gates, which pertained to the Prior of Lewes, in Sussex, and was his residence when he came to London; it is now a common hostelry for travellers, and hath a sign of the  <Q> Walnut-Tree.</Q> </QUOTE> In Maitland's time it became converted into a cider-cellar, and is described as follows:-- <QUOTE>Opposite St. Olave's Church recently stood a spacious stone building, the city mansion of the Prior of Lewes, in Sussex; the chapel of which, consisting of <num value="2">two</num> aisles, being still remaining at the upper end of Walnut-tree Alley; it is converted into a cider-cellar or warehouse, and by the earth's being greatly raised in this neighbourhood it is at present underground; and the Gothic building, a little westward of the same (at present a wine-vault belonging to the  <Q>King's Head</Q>  Tavern), under the school-house, a small chapel, I take to have been part of the said mansion-house.

At the further end are <num value="2">two</num> windows. This ancient apartment consists of <num value="4">four</num> groined arches, supported on dwarf columns. From   this is an entrance to another vault of various dimensions, but the length is <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> feet <num value="4">four</num> inches. Part of this vault is arched as the former, and part groined, over which the stairs leading to the grammar-school are erected.</QUOTE> All this, however, has now   been removed, but is recorded here for the benefit of future antiquaries. 
   <P>The school here referred to was originally styled the <QUOTE><LEMMA id="lemma.105.2">Free Grammar School of Queen Elizabeth</LEMMA>, in the parish of St. Olave's,</QUOTE> that queen having incorporated <num value="16">sixteen</num> of the parishioners to be the governors.   The school was founded in <datestruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct> for <QUOTE>instructing the boys of the parish in English grammar and writing.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct>, Charles II., <QUOTE>for the better education of the rich as well as of the poor,</QUOTE> granted a further charter, enabling them (the governors) to hold revenues to the amount of <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> a year, which were to be applied <QUOTE>in maintenance of the schoolmaster, ushers, the house and possessions, the maintenance and education of <num value="2">two</num> scholars at the university (not confining it to either Oxford or Cambridge), for setting forth poor scholars apprentices, for the relief of poor impotent persons of the parish, maintaining a workhouse, and to other purposes.</QUOTE> By order of the vestry of St. Olave's parish, the vestry-hall was fitted up for the purposes of the school, which was kept there until the year <datestruct value="1829"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, soon after which period the building was pulled down for forming the approaches to new London Bridge. After a succession of changes, the London and Greenwich Railway Company provided a piece of ground in Bermondsey Street on which a new school-house was erected.   This building, which was completed in <datestruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct>, was in the Tudor style of architecture; it was constructed of red brick with stone dressings, and formed <num value="2">two</num> sides of a quadrangle, which was cut diagonally by the roadway. In the centre of the building was an octagonal tower, containing, on the ground-floor, a porch open on <num value="3">three</num> sides, and leading to a corridor of general communication.   On <num value="1">one</num> side of this octagonal tower were the school-rooms, large and well-lighted apartments, and on the other side were the head-master's house, and also the court-room   in which the governors met to transact business, and which also served as the school library. The building is said to have been highly creditable to all concerned in its erection; but it was unfortunate with regard to its situation. It could be seen, and then to great disadvantage, only from the school-yard, or from the railway, which intersected the school-yard diagonally, at a height of about <num value="20">twenty</num> feet above the level of the ground. The entrance to the school was from Bermondsey Street, through <num value="1">one</num> of the arches of the railway.   The location of the school in this spot was not destined to be of long duration; for on the widening of the railway, in consequence of the formation of the South-Eastern and London and Brighton Railways, its site was wanted, and the school was once more transferred farther eastward, at the end of Tooley Street, where we shall have more to say of it when speaking of the new building. 
   <P>We have already, in our notice of the High Street, Southwark, spoken of the Mint which was established there by Henry VIII.; but it appears that there was a Mint on this side of the river as far back as the Saxon times. It is supposed to have occupied the spot where afterwards was the house of the Prior of Lewes, and under the Norman kings there was a Mint nearly on the same spot. 
   <P>The wharves and buildings near St. Olave's Church have been the scene of some extensive conflagrations. <num value="1">One</num> of these took place in <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>, in which Fenning's Wharf was consumed. Another fire broke out on the same spot on the <datestruct VALUE="1843-08-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>, and during the time it raged several of the buildings in its vicinity were almost totally destroyed. Among these, as we have previously stated, were St. Olave's Church, Topping's Wharf, Watson's telegraph, and other adjacent buildings. It was stated at the time that the church might have been saved, but Mr. Braidwood, the superintendent of the London Fire Brigade, considered it advisable to direct his attention to preventing the fire reaching the valuable surrounding property, amounting to upwards of <measure value="500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500000">500,000</num></measure> in value. A few years later, on the <datestruct VALUE="1861-06-22"><day reg="22">22nd</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>, a most destruc. tive fire, said to have been caused by spontaneous combustion, broke out at <LEMMA id="lemma.106.1">Cotton's Wharf</LEMMA>, Tooley <pb id="P.106" n="106">   Street, a little to the east of St. Olave's Church, and continued smouldering for several days. In his endeavours to check the ravages of this fire,   Mr. Braidwood lost his life.   He was buried, as we have already seen, at Abney Park Cemetery, and a tablet has been inserted in the wall near the entrance to the wharf to mark the spot where he fell. The damage caused by this fire amounted to   <measure value="2000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000000">2,000,000</num></measure>. In some of these conflagrations, considerable damage has been done to the shipping on the river, by the burning oil and pitch overspreading the surface of the river. In the <QUOTE>Cyclopaedia of Insurance,</QUOTE> we read that in <datestruct VALUE="1731-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1731">1731</year></datestruct>, a large number of vessels were burnt on the Thames through the overturning of a pot of boiling pitch!   Verily there is, after all, some truth in the old saying about <QUOTE>setting the Thames on fire.</QUOTE> 
    <P>To return to Mill Lane, we may add that there is-or, at all events, was in <datestruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>-an inn here called the <QUOTE>Lion and Key,</QUOTE> no doubt a corruption of the <QUOTE>Lion on the Quay.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The Borough Compter, formerly situated in this lane, was <num value="1">one</num> of the prisons visited and described by John Howard.   He pictures it as in a deplorable condition, <QUOTE>out of repair and ruinous, without an infirmary and even without bedding; while most of the inmates were poor creatures from the  <Q>Court of Conscience,</Q>  who lay there till their debts were paid.</QUOTE> The Compter was removed hither from St.  Margaret's Hill, as stated in a previous chapter.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="58">58</num>.</NOTE>
 Till a comparatively recent period (<datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>), prisoners accused of felonies were here detained, and debtors were imprisoned here. If they could pay sixpence a day, they could have the luxury of a room <num value="8">eight</num> feet square. They were allowed a twopenny loaf a day, but neither straw for bedding, fire, medical or religious attention; and a man might be imprisoned on this regimen for a debt of a guinea for <num value="40">forty</num> days without being able to change his clothes or wash his face or hands during the period of his imprisonment. This miserable state of things was strongly represented to the Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct>, but no answer was received to the expostulation. 
   <P>In a narrow turning out of Tooley Street, near the back of Guy's Hospital, is a small inn, much frequented by seafaring persons, called the <QUOTE>Ship and Shovel.</QUOTE> The sign may allude to the shovels used in taking out ballast, or cargoes in bulk, or it may refer to the gallant but unfortunate Sir Cloudesley Shovel, whose wreck and death at the Scilly Islands we mentioned in our account of the monuments in Westminster Abbey.<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="420">420</num>.</NOTE>

   <P>In Carter Lane, a turning out of Tooley Street, near St. Olave's Church, stood, till <datestruct value="1830"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, when it was pulled down to make room for the approaches of the new London Bridge, the meeting-house of the Anabaptist congregation, under the pastorate successively of Dr. Gill and Dr. Rippon.   This chapel, an ugly structure, erected in <datestruct value="1757--"><year reg="1757">1757</year></datestruct>, deserves mention here from the fact that the congregations assembling successively within its walls during several generations, after migrating to New Park   Street, are now located at Newington, in the Metropolitan Tabernacle, under Mr. Spurgeon.   The connection of this body with Carter Lane dates back to the time of the Commonwealth. Benjamin   Keach, author of some controversial works, was the minister from <datestruct value="1668--"><year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1704--"><year reg="1704">1704</year></datestruct>. In his time the congregation met in a small chapel in Goat's Yard   Passage, Horselydown. It must not be overlooked that <num value="2">two</num> centuries back Dissenting congregations did not aim at attracting notice either in the architectural details of their chapels, or in placing them in conspicuous places, as we see in modern times.   This fact will explain the circumstance that Dissenting meeting-houses were formerly to be met with in back streets and courts. Dr. Gill's ministry extended from <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1771--"><year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct>; and he in turn was succeeded in <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct> by Dr. Rippon, whose pastorate extended to <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>, so that in the long period of   <num value="116">116</num> years, the congregation and their successors had but <num value="2">two</num> ministers. Dr. Gill was <num value="1">one</num> of the most learned men whom   his denomination ever produced, and some account of him may be given here. He was born at Kettering, in Northamptonshire, in <datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>. He was educated at the grammarschool of his native town, and at an early age was famed for his acquaintance with the classic writers. His zeal for knowledge was so great that he was accustomed to spend a few hours every week in the shop of a bookseller in Kettering on market days, when only it was opened, and there he <num value="1">first</num> saw the learned works of various writers in Biblical lore, in which he afterwards became so greatly distinguished. So constant was his attendance at this shop, that the market people, speaking proverbially, were wont to say, <QUOTE>As surely as Gill is in the bookseller's shop.</QUOTE> An attempt on the part of the schoolmaster to enforce on Gill a regular attendance at the parish church led to his withdrawal from the school. With a view to enable him to enter the Nonconformist ministry, application was made for his admission into the Mile End Academy, but his precocity in learning seemed to the principals of that institution a sufficient bar to his reception by them.   He was now compelled to work at the loom, but found time to study the Greek Testament, and to obtain a little insight <pb id="P.107" n="107"> into Hebrew. Becoming a preacher of his own denomination in his native county, his fame as a scholar in due time led to an invitation to come to London to supply the pulpit at Goat's Yard, then vacant by the death of Mr. Benjamin Stinton, the son-in-law of Keach. Soon after his arrival in London, Gill became acquainted with Mr. John Skepp, a Hebrew scholar, and minister of a congregation in Cripplegate. At Skepp's death, many of his books in divinity and Rabbinical literature were purchased by Gill, to whom they proved a valuable acquisition.   He was soon able to read the Talmud and the Targums in the original, as well as the ancient commentators thereon. Even amidst these severe studies, he still found time to study the Fathers of the Church; and the fruits of these labours soon began to appear in the learned works he subsequently published.   In <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct> he issued proposals for printing an <QUOTE>Exposition of the Whole New Testament,</QUOTE> in <num value="3">three</num> folio volumes, which was completed in <datestruct value="1748--"><year reg="1748">1748</year></datestruct>. For this undertaking Gill received the degree of Doctor of Divinity, from Marischal College, Aberdeen. When his friends congratulated him on this token of respect, he remarked, <QUOTE>I neither thought it, nor bought, nor sought it.</QUOTE> Between <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct> he published <QUOTE>An Exposition of the Old and New Testament,</QUOTE> in <num value="9">nine</num> volumes, which Robert Hall considered to be <QUOTE>a continent of mud,</QUOTE> while John Ryland characterised it as <QUOTE>an ocean of divinity.</QUOTE> He also published <QUOTE>A Body of Divinity,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Cause of God and Truth,</QUOTE> and other learned works. 
   <P>He was at times keenly engaged in controversy, and contended in turn with Whitby, Wesley, and other opponents of the Calvinistic school of theology. How he managed to prepare for publication such an array of learned literary matter surprised many of his friends. He was accustomed to rise as soon as it was light in the winter, and usually before <num value="6">six</num> in the summer; and by this Disposal of his time, to say nothing of the duties of his pastorate, and the frequent demands on the preaching services of such an eminent scholar, he was able to send forth to the world some ponderous tomes, the preparation of which, and its subsequent correction for the press, must have been no ordinary undertaking.   It is stated that although his folio volumes would be sufficient to fill <num value="10000">10,000</num> printed quarto pages, he never employed an amanuensis in preparing his copy for the press.   He died at Camberwell on the <datestruct VALUE="1771-10-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct>. As a proof that <QUOTE>relics</QUOTE> are still held in honour among Protestants, it may be added that the pulpit in which Dr. Gill preached is now   used by the students in the college attached to the Metropolitan Tabernacle; aid the chair once used by the doctor in his study has been transferred to the vestry of the Tabernacle of Mr. Spurgeon. 
   <P>Among the anecdotes related of Dr. Gill, <num value="1">one</num> may be given, as it throws some light upon the <QUOTE>service of song</QUOTE> a century or more back. In his days the psalmody in many of the Dissenting Chapels was at the lowest possible ebb, and the stock of hymn-tunes possessed by Dr. Gill's clerk must have been very small; for on <num value="1">one</num> occasion an aged dame waited on the doctor to complain that the clerk, in about <num value="3">three</num> years, had introduced <num value="2">two</num> new tunes. Not that he was a famous singer, or able to conduct a great variety of song, but he did his best. The young people of the congregation, naturally enough, were pleased with the new tunes; but the good woman could not bear the innovation. The doctor, after patiently listening, asked her whether she understood singing. <QUOTE>No,</QUOTE> she replied. <QUOTE>What! can't you. sing?</QUOTE> She confessed that she was no singer, nor her aged father before her; and though they had had about a <num value="100">hundred</num> years between them to learn the Old Hundreth Psalm, they could not sing it nor any other tune. The doctor did not hurt her feelings by telling her that people who did not understand singing were the last who ought to complain; but he meekly said, <QUOTE>Sister, what tunes should you like us to sing?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Why, sir,</QUOTE> she replied, <QUOTE>I should very much like David's tunes.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Well,</QUOTE> said he, <QUOTE>if you will get David's tunes for us, we can then try to sing them.</QUOTE> It need scarcely be added that in Dr. Gill's meetinghouse at Horselydown the duty of leading the psalmody devolved on the clerk, whose salary, it appears, was half the sum paid to the pew-opener, or only <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure> per annum! 
   <P>Whiston, the translator of <QUOTE>Josephus,</QUOTE> intended to hear Dr. Gill preach, and would have done so had he not learned the fact that the doctor had written a volume on the Song of Solomon, which, in Whiston's opinion, did not form any part of the canonical Scriptures.   For this reason Whiston declined to enter Gill's chapel. 
   <P>Dr. Rippon, who succeeded Dr. Gill at Carter Lane in <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>, and continued the minister of the congregation after their removal to New   Park Street, died in <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="85">eighty-fifth</num> year of his age, his pastorate having extended through the long period of <num value="63">sixty-three</num> years. His name does not shine in the literary world with such splendour as his predecessor, neither was he to be compared with Dr. Gill in theological and Oriental attainments. He compiled a selection of hymns for the use of Dissenting congregations, by whom it was <pb id="P.108" n="108"> extensively used as a supplement to Dr. Watts's hymn-book. Besides editing <QUOTE>The Baptist Annual Register,</QUOTE> he projected, in <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, a <QUOTE>History of Bunhill Fields,</QUOTE> in <num value="6">six</num> volumes, which did not meet with sufficient encouragement to enable him to carry out the intention, although <num value="10">ten</num> years had been occupied in the preparation of the materials for the undertaking. In his time the singing had improved considerably, for a tune-book once used in many Dissenting congregations bears his name. 
   <P>An anecdote, which gives us an insight into the character of Dr. Rippon, has been related of him. On a special occasion he was deputed to read an address from the Dissenters to George III., congratulating him   on his recovery from   sickness. The doctor read on with his usual clear utterance till he came to a passage in which there was a special reference to the goodness of God, when he paused and said, <QUOTE>Please your majesty, we will read that again,</QUOTE> and then proceeded with his usual cool dignity to repeat the sentence with emphasis.   No other man in the denomination would have thought of doing such a thing; but from Rippon it came so naturally that no <num value="1">one</num> censured him, or if they did, it would have had no effect upon him. 
   <P> <QUOTE>Tooley Street,</QUOTE> says Peter Cunningham, <QUOTE>will long continue to be famous from the well-known story related by Canning of  <Q>The <num value="3">Three</num> Tailors of Tooley Street,</Q>  who formed a meeting for redress of popular grievances, and though no more than <num value="3">three</num> in number, began their petition to the House of Commons with the somewhat grand opening of  <Q><hi rend=italics>We</hi>, the people of England   </Q> </QUOTE> 
   <P>The name of Tooley Street has not always been spelt in the same way. For instance, to a notice put forth in Cromwell's time by Thoras Garway, the founder of Garraway's Coffee-house, in the City, are appended the following words:<NOTE>See <title>Ellis's Letters</title> (<num value="2">Second</num> Series), vol. iv.</NOTE>-- <QUOTE>Advertisement.

   <P>On the south side, near the middle of the street, according to the <QUOTE>New View of London,</QUOTE> published in the reign of Queen Anne, was a place called the <QUOTE>Isle of Ducks;</QUOTE> but little or nothing is now known either of its history, or of its exact situation. 
   <P>The streets branching off on the south side of Tooley Street, especially those near the western end, such as Joiners' Street, Weston Street, Dean Street, and Bermondsey Street (which, Northouck says, is corruptly called Barnaby Street), pass immediately under the railway station, and therefore appear like so many underground tunnels, in which long rows of gas-lamps are continually burning. In spite of this light, however, they are unknown to history. 
   <P>John Street, Webbe Street, and Weston Street, all modern thoroughfares in the neighbourhood of the Maze Pond, keep in remembrance the names of the late Mr. John Webbe Weston, who owned much of the land hereabouts. Winding southwest- wards across some of these streets from the eastern end of St. Thomas's Street, are Snow's Fields, which have now anything but a verdant aspect. <QUOTE>Moor Fields are fields no more!</QUOTE> It is true that from this thoroughfare--for it is nothing more nor less than a narrow street--a glimpse is caught of some green and flourishing foliage in the rear of Guy's Hospital; but all traces of garden grounds are fast disappearing.   John Timbs has a word or <num value="2">two</num> to say about this spot in his <QUOTE>Autobiography.</QUOTE> Speaking of his boyhood, he observes: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>The love of gardening and raising flowers has ever been with me a favourite pursuit. Even in that sooty suburb in Southwark, Snow's Fields, at a very early age, I had the range of a large garden, and a plot set apart for my special culture. But I had fancied failures: 
          <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=couplet><L>Oh! ever thus from childhood's hour 
               <L>I've seen my fondest hopes decay;

               <L>But &lsquo;twas the <num value="1">first</num> to fade away.</QUOTE>
Still, what I attributed to fate was, in most cases, traceable to the poisonous atmosphere of the manufacturing suburb.</QUOTE>

   <P> <QUOTE>There was a time,</QUOTE> says Mr. Charles Knight, in his <QUOTE>London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>when the manufacture of hats formed <num value="1">one</num> of the characteristics of this neighbourhood; but this branch of manufacture, from some cause with which we are not well acquainted, has suffered a curious migration. At about the end of the last century and the beginning of the present, the  <Q> Maze</Q>  (a district between Bermondsey Street and the Borough High Street), Teoley Street, the northern end of Bermondsey Street, and other streets in the immediate vicinity, formed the grand centre of the hat manufacture of London; but since then some commercial motive-power has exerted a leverage which has transferred nearly the whole assemblage farther westward. If we wish to find the centre of this manufacture, with its subordinate branches of hat-block makers, hat-dyers, hat-lining and leather cutters, hat shag-makers, hat-tip makers, hat-bowstring makers, hat-furriers, <pb id="P.109" n="109"> hat-trimming makers, &amp;c., we must visit the district included between the Borough High Street and Blackfriars Road.   A glance at that curious record of statistical facts, a  <Q>London Directory,</Q>  will show to what an extent this manufacture is carried on in the district just marked out. It is true that Bermondsey still contains <num value="1">one</num> hat-factory, which has been characterised as the largest in the world, and that Tooley Street still exhibits a sprinking of smaller firms; but the manufacture is no longer a feature to be numbered among the peculiarities of Bermondsey.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Passing from Snow's Fields, under the railway arches, by way of Crucifix Lane, a name which savours of <QUOTE>the olden time,</QUOTE> we enter Artillery Street, Horselydown, or, as it was formerly called, Horsey Down. The parish of St. Olave's having greatly increased both in houses and population, the commissioners for erecting <num value="50">fifty</num> new churches within the <QUOTE>bills of mortality</QUOTE> purchased a site for a church and cemetery, consisting of a field, which was walled in and called the <QUOTE>Artillery Ground,</QUOTE> from the fact that the train-bands of Southwark used to practise therein. The church was accordingly built, and dedicated to St. John,

 and, agreeably to an Act of the <num value="6">6th</num> Geo. II. <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>the district of Horsey-down, Horsa-down, or Horsley-down (so called from its having been used by the inhabitants as a grazing-field for their horses and cattle), was appointed for the new parish.</QUOTE> Elmes observes, very absurdly: <QUOTE>Popular legends derive its name from   a belief that the horse of King John lay down with that monarch upon his back, and hence <hi rend=italics>horse-lye-down</hi>; but as the entire tract so called was, according to Stow, a grazing-ground, called Horse-down, it is more probably a corruption of that title.</QUOTE> In speaking of the derivation of the name of Horselydown, the author of <QUOTE>A   New   View   of London</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>), remarks: <QUOTE>This street, as I was told by a sober counsellor at law, who said he had it from an old record, was so called for that the water, formerly overflowing it, was so effectually drawn off that the place became a green field, where horses and other cattle used to pasture and lye down before the   street was built.</QUOTE> Near it, as we further learn from the same work, was Horselydown Fair Street, described as a considerable street, between Paris Street, Tooley Street, and <num value="5">Five</num> Foot Lane, Southwark. <pb id="P.110" n="110"> 
    <P>Thomas Guy, the founder of the famous hospital bearing his name, was born in this street. His birthplace is thus accurately fixed by Maitland:-- <QUOTE>He (Guy) was born in the north-east corner house of Pritchard's Alley (<num value="2">two</num> doors east of St.  John's Churchyard), in Fair Street, Horsleydown.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Amidst the changes of old London,</QUOTE> says Charles  Knight, in his <QUOTE>Shadows of the Old Booksellers,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Fair Street still exists, and has a due place in the  Post Office Guide to principal streets and places.  It is at the eastern extremity of Tooley Street, where Horselydown begins, and at a short distance from the Thames.   The Down, where horses once grazed, and where probably the child Thomas  Guy once played, is now built over.   The father of this boy was a lighterman and coal-dealer, and it is most likely that the young son of a man so occupied would be familiar with the locality between Horselydown and London Bridge.   <num value="1">One</num> building seems to have lived in his memory in connection with early associations. St. Thomas's  Hospital, an old almonry, had been bought by the citizens of London, at the dissolution of the religious houses, as a place of reception for diseased people. It was fast falling into decay when Thomas  Guy looked upon it in his boyhood.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The church, dedicated to St. John the Evangelist, was finished in <datestruct value="1732--"><year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct>; it is a plain stone building, lighted by <num value="2">two</num> ranges of windows, and has an apsidal termination at the eastern end. The square tower, containing <num value="10">ten</num> bells, is surmounted with a spire in the form of a fluted Ionic pillar. The church is seen to the northward from the London and Greenwich Railway. 
    <P>In Goat's Yard, Horselydown, was the meetinghouse of the celebrated Benjamin Keach, who, from   <datestruct value="1668--"><year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1704--"><year reg="1704">1704</year></datestruct>, was the minister of a Nonconformist congregation assembling there, <num value="1">one</num> of the oldest of such congregations in Southwark and Bermondsey, and the precursor of the congregation now assembling in the Metropolitan Tabernacle. For very excellent reasons, the Dissenters of those stirring times in English history were not anxious to attract notice in the style of architecture of their meeting-houses, nor did they erect them in conspicuous situations, for during the reign of Charles II. they almost met by stealth, much in the same way as the Roman Catholics were wont to do a century or so later.   When Charles II. issued his declaration of indulgence in <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>, Keach, among others, took advantage of it, and his congregation erected their <num value="1">first</num> meeting-house in Goat's Yard. This chapel no longer exists, for a century later, the lease having run out, it became a cooperage, and afterwards a blacksmith's forge. In front of the chapel was a court, bounded by a brick wall, and a peep through the iron gates would have shown an avenue of limes leading to the principal entrance.   It must have been thought a building of some magnitude at that epoch, seeing that it accommodated as many as <num value="1000">1,000</num> persons. <num value="1">One</num> curious fact connected with Keach's chapel may here be mentioned, as it throws some light upon the manners and customs of <num value="2">two</num> centuries ago. In many of the Dissenting chapels of the times of the later Stuarts there was no singing-not, as some persons have erroneously supposed, lest their sounds might be heard by their enemies; but from the idea that only the really spiritual persons ought to sing, and not the unconverted. There was a great controversy about this question among the Nonconformists, and many pamphlets were written on both sides of the question. Keach contended that all the congregation ought to sing, and he fought zealously for this practice for many years, and lived to see his ideas make way. At <num value="1">one</num> time there was a sort of drawn battle between Keach and some of his people, and an understanding was at length come to that at <num value="1">one</num> period of the service, during the psalmody, those who objected to the singing should leave the chapel and walk about the chapel-yard, among the graves of the <hi rend=italics>silent</hi> dead, and then come in again after what they objected to was over! Keach was the author of <QUOTE>An Exposition of the Parables,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>A Key to open Scripture Metaphors,</QUOTE> and some controversial pamphlets. At <num value="1">one</num> time he found it necessary to reply to some persons who had contrived to unsettle the minds of the young people and apprentices of the congregation, by arguing that Saturday was the true Sabbath. For the publication of a series of discourses on this subject, under the title of <QUOTE>The Jewish Sabbath Abrogated,</QUOTE> in which he treated the subject controversially, Keach was complimented by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The death of Keach was thus celebrated by <num value="1">one</num> of his congregation in the following lines : 
   <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=stanza><L>Is he no more? has Heaven withdrawn his light, 
     <L>And left us to lament, in sable shades of night, 
     <L>Our loss? 
     </LG><LG type=stanza><L>Death boasts his triumph; for the rumour's spread 
     <L>Through Salem's plains, that Keach, dear Keach, is 
        <L>dead.</QUOTE>
 
   <P>Southwark, as is generally known, was a famous rendezvous of the Nonconformists <num value="2">two</num> centuries ago, and such it has continued to be down to our own day.   In the time of Charles II., and even earlier, the Anabaptists were accustomed to practise immersion in the river, and at that date several quiet spots existed on the banks of the Thames <pb id="P.111" n="111"> not far eastward from London Bridge, suitable for that purpose.   But the increase of dwellings in the neighbourhood of the river soon rendered this practice impossible. A building for this particular object, Mr. Pike tells us, existed in Horselydown in the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. It was called the Baptisterion, and attached to it were dressing-rooms. It was the common place of adult immersion for southern London. A conference, which assembled in <datestruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct>, provided funds for the rebuilding of the structure. The chapel never appears to have had any regular congregation associated with it, but elderly persons were living at the commencement of the present century who remembered the place being used as a preaching station. The passage leading to the meeting-house was called <QUOTE>Dipping Alley.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Near the north-east corner of St. John's churchyard, and at the eastern end of Tooley Street, stands the new Free Grammar School of the united parishes of St. Olave's and St. John's, of which we have spoken above.   The building, like its predecessor in Bermondsey Street, is in the Tudor style of architecture, and is altogether an ornament to the neighbourhood. It comprises a residence for the master and the usual school buildings; but the chief architectural feature is the central tower, over the doorway of which is a statue of the founder, Queen Elizabeth. 
   <P> <QUOTE>Early in the reign of Elizabeth,</QUOTE> says Mr. Corner, in his account of the above seminary, in the <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi>, <datestruct VALUE="1836-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>when the foundation of public schools was promoted throughout the country, under the authority of the legislature and the patronage of the crown, the parishioners of St. Saviour's, Southwark, set a noble example to their neighbours in the establishment of their admirable Free Grammar School; and the inhabitants of the parish of St. Olave were not slow to follow so enlightened and benevolent a policy. St. Olave's School was set on foot in the year <datestruct value="1560"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>, and constituted  <Q>The Free Grammar School of Queen Elizabeth of the Parishioners of the parish of St. Olave, by letters patent issued in <datestruct value="1571--"><year reg="1571">1571</year></datestruct>.</Q> </QUOTE> 
   <P>In this institution provision is made for a commercial as well as a classical education.   The ancient seal of the school bears the date of <datestruct value="1576--"><year reg="1576">1576</year></datestruct>. It represents the master seated in the school-room, with <num value="5">five</num> boys standing near him. The rod is a prominent object, as in other school seals, which may be seen in Carlisle's <QUOTE>Grammar Schools,</QUOTE> some of which are also inscribed with the wellknown maxim   of King Solomon, then   strictly maintained, but now nearly exploded, <QUOTE>Qui parcit virgam   odit filium</QUOTE> ( <QUOTE>He who spares the rod spoils the child</QUOTE> ). A fac-simile of the seal, in cast iron or carved in stone, is placed in front of most of the houses belonging to the school.   Robert Browne, a Puritan minister, and founder of the sect of Brownists, was master of St. Olave's Grammar School from <datestruct value="1586--"><year reg="1586">1586</year></datestruct> till <datestruct value="1591"><year reg="1591">1591</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>The following particulars of this locality, of which but scant notices are found in any local history or topographical work, were given by the late Mr.  G. R. Corner, F.S.A., at a special general meeting of the Surrey Archeological Society, held at St.  Olave's Branch School-house, in <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>. <QUOTE>It is difficult,</QUOTE> he said, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>to imagine that a neighbourhood now so crowded with wharves and warehouses, granaries and factories, mills, breweries, and places of business of all kinds, and where the busy hum of men at work like bees in a hive is incessant, can have been, not many centuries since, a region of fields and meadows, pastures for sheep and cattle, with pleasant houses and gardens, shady lanes where lovers might wander (not unseen), clear streams with stately swans, and cool walks by the river-side.   Yet such was the case; and the way from   London Bridge to Horselydown was occupied by the mansions of men of mark and consequence, dignitaries of the Church, men of military renown, and wealthy citizens.   <num value="1">First</num>, in  St. Olave's Street, opposite to the church, was the  London residence of the Priors of Lewes.   Adjoining to the church, on the east side, where  Chamberlain's wharf now stands, was the house of the Priors of St. Augustine at Canterbury; next to which was the Bridge House; and a little further eastward was the house of the Abbots of  Battle, in Sussex, with pleasant gardens and a clear stream   (now a black and fcetid sewer), flowing down Mill Lane, and turning the abbot's mill at  Battle Bridge Stairs.   On this stream were swans, and it flowed under a bridge (over which the road was continued to Bermondsey and Horselydown), from   the Manor of the Maze, the seat of Sir  William Burcestre or Bourchier, who died there in <datestruct value="1407--"><year reg="1407">1407</year></datestruct>, and Sir John Burcestre, who died there in <datestruct value="1466--"><year reg="1466">1466</year></datestruct>, and was buried at St. Olave's; and afterwards of Sir Roger Copley.   The site is now known by the not very pleasant name of Maze  Pond.   From the corner of Bermondsey Street to  Horselydown was formerly called   Horselydown  Lane; and here, on the west side of Stoney Lane, which was once a Roman road leading to the 
 <foreign lang=la>trajectus</foreign>, or ferry over the river to the Tower  (as Stoney Street, in St. Saviour's, was a similar  Roman road leading to the ferry to Dowgate), was the mansion of Sir John Fastolf, who fought at Agincourt, and was Governor of Normandy.   He <pb id="P.112" n="112"> died at his castle of Caistor, in Norfolk, in <datestruct value="1460--"><year reg="1460">1460</year></datestruct>, at the age of <num value="81">eighty-one</num> years. 
   <P>During the insurrection of Jack Cade in <datestruct value="1450--"><year reg="1450">1450</year></datestruct>, Sir John Fastolf furnished his place in Southwark with the old soldiers of Normandy, and habiliments of war, to defend himself against the rebels; but having sent an emissary to them   at Blackheath, the man was taken prisoner, and narrowly escaped execution as a spy. They brought him, however, with them   into Southwark, and sent him   to Sir John, whom   he advised to put away all his habiliments of war and the old soldiers; and so he did, and went himself to the Tower, with all his household.   He was, however, in danger from   both parties, for Jack Cade would have burned his house, and he was likely to be impeached for treason for retiring to the Tower, instead of resisting and attacking the rebels, which probably he had not force enough to attempt, as they had entire possession of the Borough. 
   <P>Further east, and nearly opposite to the Tower of London, was  <Q>The Rosary.</Q>  This belonged to the family of Dunlegh, who appears to have been of some consequence in Southwark at an early period. Richard Dunlegh was returned to the Parliament held at York, <num value="26">26th</num> Edward I., as <num value="1">one</num> of the representatives of the borough of Southwark, and so was Henry le Dunlegh to the Parliament held at Lincoln, in the <num value="28">28th</num> of Edward I. 
   <P>Still further eastward on the bank of the river was the Liberty of St. John.   The Prior of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem   held in the reign of Edward I. <num value="3">three</num> water-mills, <num value="3">three</num> acres of land, <num value="1">one</num> acre of meadow, and <num value="20">twenty</num> acres of pasture, at Horsedowne <hi rend=italics>(sic</hi>) in Southwark, which in the reign of Edward III. Francis de Bachenie held for the term of his life, on the demise of brother Thomas le Archer, late Prior.   Courts were held for this manor down to a period comparatively   recent.      Messrs. Courage's   brewery stands on the site of the mill and manor-house; and in a lease from   Sir William   Abdy to Mr. Donaldson, dated in <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, there was an exception of the hall of the mill-house, court-house, or manorhouse, to hold a Court once or oftener in every year. 
   <P>At the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, St. John's mill was in the tenure of Hugh Eglesfield, by virtue of a lease granted by the Prior of St. John to Christopher Craven, for <num value="60">sixty</num> years, from Midsummer, <num value="23">23rd</num> Henry VIII., at the yearly rent of <measure value="8l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="8">8</num></measure>.   It was sold by the king, in his <num value="36">thirty-sixth</num> year, to John Eyre.   The estate has for many years belonged to the family of Sir William Ably, Bart., having come to them from the families of Gainsford and Thomas, whose names are commemorated in Gainsford   Street and Thomas Street.   Shad Thames is a narrow street, running along the water-side, through the ancient Liberty of St. John, from Pickle Herring to Dockhead. 
    <P>Horselydown was a large field anciently used by the neighbouring inhabitants for pasturing their horses and cattle, and was called Horsedown or Horseydown.   It was part of the possessions of the Abbey of Bermondsey, and is within the lordship of the manor of Southwark, surrendered to King Henry VIII. with the other possessions of the abbey in <datestruct value="1537--"><year reg="1537">1537</year></datestruct>. This manor is now called the Great Liberty Manor, and is <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> manors of Southwark belonging to the Corporation of London, King Edward VI. having granted this manor, with the manor or lordship of Southwark (now   called the King's Manor, and formerly belonging to the see of Canterbury), to the City of London, by charter of ist Edward VI. Horseydown was probably the common of the Great Liberty Manor. 
    <P>After the surrender to Henry VIII., Horseydown became the property of Sir Roger Copley, of Galton, Surrey, and the Maze, in Southwark, of whom it was purchased by Adam Beeston, Henry Goodyere, and Hugh Eglisfeilde, <num value="3">three</num> inhabitants of the parish of St. Olave, and was assured to them by a fine levied to them by Sir Roger Copley and Dame Elizabeth his wife, in the reign of Henry VIII.   The parish of St. Olave came into possession of <num value="1">1</num>Horseydown in <datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>, under a lease which the sane Hugh Eglisfeilde had purchased of <num value="1">one</num> Robert Warren, and which the parish purchased of him for <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> and <measure value="12d." type=currency><num value="12">twelve</num> pence</measure> (the sum he had paid to Warren for it), and the grazing of <num value="2">two</num> kine in Horsedown for his life.

    <P>The freehold of Horseydown having become vested solely in Hugh Eglisfeild as the surviving joint-tenant, it descended to his son Christopher Eglisfeild, of Gray's Inn, gentleman, who by deed dated <datestruct VALUE="1581-12-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1581">1581</year></datestruct>, conveyed Horseydown to the governors of St. Olave's Grammar School, to whom it still belongs; and it is <num value="1">one</num> of the remarkable instances of the enormous increase in the value of property in the metropolis, that this piece of land, which was then let to farm to <num value="1">one</num> Alderton, who collected the weekly payments for pasturage, and paid for it a rental of <measure value="6l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6">6</num></measure> per annum, now produces to the governors for the use of the school an annual income exceeding <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure>.</QUOTE>

   <P>It is not known whether Southwark Fair was <pb id="P.113" n="113"> ever held on <QUOTE>Horseydown ;</QUOTE> but it is worthy of remark that when the down came to be built over, about the middle of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, the principal street across it, from west to east, was, and is to the present day, called Fair Street; and a street of houses, running from north to south, near to Dockhead, is called <num value="3">Three</num> Oak Lane, traditionally from   <num value="3">three</num> oaks formerly standing there. In Evelyn's time, however ( <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> <datestruct VALUE="1660-09-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>), the fair appears to have been held at St. Margaret's Hill, in the Borough, as we have already seen.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="58">58</num>.</NOTE>

   <P>The old Artillery Hall of the Southwark <QUOTE>Trainbands</QUOTE> stood on the site of the present workhouse in Parish Street, a little to the west of St. John's Church.   It was erected in the year <datestruct value="1639"><year reg="1639">1639</year></datestruct>, when the governors of the school granted a lease to Cornelius Cooke and others, of a piece of ground forming part of Horseydown, and enclosed with a brick wall, to be employed for a Martial Yard, in which the Artillery Hall was built.   In <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct> the governors granted the churchwardens a lease of part of the Martial Yard for <num value="500">500</num> years for a burialground; but they reserved all the ground whereon the Artillery House then stood, and <QUOTE>all the herbage of the ground, and also liberty for the militia or trained bands of the borough of Southwark, and also his Majesty's military forces, to muster and exercise arms upon the said ground.</QUOTE> The election for Southwark was held at the Artillery Hall in <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>; and at the following sessions-then held at the Bridge House-Slingsby Bethell, Esq., sheriff of London, who had been a losing candidate at the election, was indicted for and, convicted of an assault on Robert Mason, a waterman, from Lambeth, who was standing on the steps of the hall with others, and obstructing Mr. Bethell's friends.   Mr. Bethell was fined <measure value="5bmark" type=currency><num value="5">five</num> marks</measure>. 
    <P>In the year <datestruct value="1725"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct> the Artillery Hall was converted by the governors into a workhouse for the parish, and in <datestruct value="1736--"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct> the parish church of St. John, Horselydown, as stated above, was built on part of the martial ground.   The hall was entirely demolished about the year <datestruct value="1836"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>. Messrs. Courage and Donaldson's brewery, at the corner of Shad Thames, stands, as we have already stated, on the site of the manor-house of St. John of Jerusalem, which formerly belonged to St. John's Hospital, in Clerkenwell. This estate, and that of the governors of the Grammar School, and another estate belonging to Magdalen College, Oxford, called the Isle of Ducks, mentioned   above, comprehend almost the whole of this parish.   It has been conjectured that the name of the street running along the river-side, and from St. Saviour's Dock to Dockhead, and called Shad Thames, may be an abbreviation of <QUOTE>St. John-at-Thames.</QUOTE> Shad Thames, and, indeed, the whole river-side, contain extensive granaries and storehouses for the supply of the metropolis.   Indeed, from Morgan's Lane--a turning about the middle of Tooley Street, on the north side, to St. Saviour's (once called Savory) Dock, the whole line of streetcalled in <num value="1">one</num> part Pickle Herring Street, and in another Shad Thames-exhibits an uninterrupted series of wharves, warehouses, mills, and factories, on both sides of the narrow and crowded roadway. The buildings on the northern side are contiguous to the river, and through gateways and openings in these we witness the busy scenes and the mazes of shipping which pertain to such a spot.   The part of Bermondsey upon which we are now entering is as remarkable for its appearance as for its importance, in past times at least, seeing that it was connected with the manufactures of Bermondsey. 
   <P>The waterside division of Bermondsey, or that part of the parish situate east of St. Saviour's Dock, and adjoining the parish of Rotherhithe, .s intersected by several streams or watercourses.   Upon the south bank of <num value="1">one</num> of these, between Mill Street and George Row, stand-or stood till very recently--a number of very ancient houses, called London Street. All Londoners have heard of the <QUOTE>Rookery</QUOTE> --or, as it was more universally called, the <QUOTE>Holy Land</QUOTE> --which formerly existed in St. Giles's; and   of the <QUOTE>shy neighbourhood</QUOTE> of Somers Town, which we have already described.<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="368">368</num>.</NOTE>
Charles Dickens, in his <QUOTE>Uncommercial Traveller,</QUOTE> speaks of another <QUOTE>shy neighbourhood</QUOTE> over the Surrey side of London Bridge, <QUOTE>among the fastnesses of Jacob's Island and Dockhead.</QUOTE> Little, perhaps, was known of Jacob's Island, in Bermondsey, until it was rendered familiar to the public in the pages of <num value="1">one</num> of Dickens's most popular works, <QUOTE>Oliver Twist,</QUOTE> where the features which this spot presented a few years ago-and in part exhibit at the present time--are described so vividly, and with such close accuracy, that we cannot do better than quote the passage.   He <num value="1">first</num> speaks of the ditch itself and the houses exterior to the island. <QUOTE>A stranger, standing on <num value="1">one</num> of the wooden bridges thrown across this ditch in Mill Street, will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering, from their back doors and windows, buckets, pails, and domestic utensils in <pb id="P.114" n="114"> which to haul the water up; and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves, his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him. Crazy wooden galleries, common to the backs of half-a-dozen houses, with holes from whence to look on the slime beneath; windows, broken and patched, with poles thrust out on which to dry the linen that is never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the air would seem   too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud, and threatening to fall into it, as some of them have done; dirt-besmeared walls and decaying foundations-all these ornament the banks of Folly Ditch.</QUOTE> This is the scene in the narrow passages near the Island, <num value="2">two</num> of which are known by the humble names of Halfpenny Alley and Farthing Alley. In Jacob's Island itself the <QUOTE>warehouses are roofless and empty, the walls are crumbling down, the windows are now no windows, the doors are falling into the street, the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke; and, through losses and Chancery suits, it is made quite a desolate island indeed,</QUOTE> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.114" n="2000.14.0042"><HEAD>Hall Of The Southwark <QUOTE>Train-Bands,</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
   <P>Rough and wild as the spot appears when the ditch is filled at high tide, yet, if we visit it <num value="6">six</num> hours afterwards, when mud usurps the place of water, more than <num value="1">one</num> organ of sense is strongly and unpleasantly appealed to. Wilkinson gave a view of this spot in the <QUOTE>Londina Illustrata</QUOTE> in the early part of the present century, and the interval of time does not seem to have produced much change in the appearance of the scene. In the plate here alluded to, the spectator is supposed to be standing on Jacob's Island, and looking across the Folly Ditch, to the crazy, ancient houses of London Street. 
    <P> <QUOTE>The history of this ditch or tide-stream,</QUOTE> says Charles Knight in his <QUOTE>London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>is connected, in a remarkable way, with the manufacturing features of Bermondsey.   When the abbey was at the height of its glory, and formed a nucleus to which all else in the neighbourhood was subordinate, the supply of water for its inmates was obtained from the Thames through the medium of this tide. Bermondsey was probably at <num value="1">one</num> time very little better than a morass, the whole being low and level: indeed, at the present time, manufacturers in that locality find the utmost difficulty <pb id="P.115" n="115"> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.115" n="2000.14.0043"><HEAD>Old Houses In London Street, Dockhead, About <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="P.116" n="116"> in obtaining a firm foundation for their buildings, such is the spongy nature of the ground. In the early period just alluded to, the spot, besides being low, was almost entirely unencumbered with buildings; and thus a channel from the Thames, although not many feet in depth, was filled throughout the entire district at every high tide.   There was a mill at the river-side, at which the corn for the granary of the abbey was ground; and this mill was turned by the flux and reflux of the water along the channel. When the abbey was destroyed, and the ground passed into the possession of others, the houses which were built on the site still received a supply of water from this watercourse. In process of time tanneries were established on the spot, most probably on account of the valuable supply of fresh water obtainable every <num value="12">twelve</num> hours from the river. This seems to be an opinion entertained by many of the principal manufacturers of the place.</QUOTE> 
   <P>A writer in the <hi rend=italics>Morning Chronicle</hi>, some years ago, alluding to this particular locality, remarks: <QUOTE>The striking peculiarity of Jacob's Island consists in the wooden galleries and sleeping-rooms at the back of the houses, which overhang the dark flood, and are built upon piles, so that the place has positively the air of a Flemish street, flanking a sewer instead of a canal; while the little rickety bridges that span the ditches and connect court with court, give it the appearance of the Venice of drains.</QUOTE> The same writer observes that <QUOTE>in the reign of Henry II. the foul stagnant ditch, which now makes an island of this pestilential spot, was a running stream, supplied with the waters which poured down from the hills about Sydenham and Nunhead, and was used for the working of the mills which then stood on its banks. These had been granted to the monks of St. Mary and St. John to grind their flour, and were dependencies upon the Priory of Bermondsey; and what is now a straw-yard skirting the river was once the City Ranelagh, called Cupid's Gardens, and the trees, now black with mud, were the bowers under which the citizens loved, on the summer evenings, to sit beside the stream drinking their sack and ale.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Dickens's graphic picture of the filth, wretchedness, and misery of Jacob's Island, at the time it was written--some <num value="20">twenty</num> years ago--was by no means overdrawn. A   vast deal has been done, however, towards removing its worst evils, although more remains to be done. <num value="1">One</num> of the missionaries of the London City Mission, in <datestruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct>, furnished a report on the district as it was when he entered it <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years ago, and as it now exists. Many of the horrors. he admits, have passed away :-- 
   <P> <QUOTE>The foul ditch no longer pollutes the air. It has long been filled up; and along Mill Street, where <Q>the crazy wooden galleries</Q> once hung over it, stands Messrs. Peek, Frean, and Co.&lsquo;s splendid biscuit bakery.   The ditch which intersected the district along London Street served as a fine bathing-place for the resident juveniles in summer-time. I have seen,</QUOTE> continues the writer, <QUOTE>many of the boys rolling joyously in the thick liquid, undeterred by the close proximity of the decomposing carcases of cats and dogs. Where this repulsive sight was often witnessed there is now   a good solid road. Many of the houses, too, in London Street have been pulled down, and the vacant space added to the houses in Hickman's Folly, thus affording them a little yard or garden.   In Dickens's sketch of the district he states that  <Q>the houses have no owners, and they are broken open and entered upon by those who have the courage.</Q>  This, in many cases, I know to be literally true. Much of the property of the district has no rightful owners, and many of the houses no claimants. In not a few cases persons have got possession of them   and have never been asked for rent. I recollect a young unmarried man occupying <num value="1">one</num> of these unclaimed houses.   He remained in it as long as he pleased, and then sold it to a bricklayer for   <measure value="5l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5">5</num></measure>. The structure of many of the old houses shows that they have been adapted to the concealment of crime. Subterranean connection between houses, and windows opening on to the roofs of other dwellings, bear witness to its being a place where desperate characters found a sure hiding-place, and where pursuit and detection were rendered next to impossible.   Most of these dens have been pulled down since I have been on the district.   Part of London Street, the whole of Little London Street, part of Mill Street, beside houses in Jacob Street and Hickman's Folly, have been demolished. In most of these places warehouses have taken the place of dwelling-houses. The revolting fact of many of the inhabitants of the district having no other water to drink than that which they procured from the filthy ditches is also a thing of the past. Most of the houses are now supplied with good water, and the streets are very well paved.   Indeed, so great is the change for the better in the external appearance of the district generally, that a person who had not seen it since the improvements would now scarcely recognise it. Such a place as Jacob's Island, especially before improvements were made, cannot excite surprise that during the prevalence of any epidemic it should come in for a very <pb id="P.117" n="117"> severe scourge and heavy death-rate.   During the cholera visitations of   <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct> the victims were alarmingly numerous. In <num value="1">one</num> fever visitation the number of cases in Jacob's Island were frightfully numerous, reaching to upwards of <num value="200">two hundred</num>, many of which were fatal. I remember that in <num value="1">one</num> house in London Street there were <num value="19">nineteen</num> cases. During the present visitation of small-pox the district has also suffered somewhat severely.   The occupations of the people are various, including more largely watermen and waterside labourers, costermongers, and woodchoppers.   The wood-choppers form   a rather numerous class in the district. In the centre of the district is a large wood-yard, containing immense stacks of wood imported from   Norway. Round the yards are sheds in which about <num value="200">200</num> persons, including men, women, boys, and girls, work. These people are generally of the lowest class, and being congregated together, young and old, they corrupt <num value="1">one</num> another. It has been for a long time a thriving nursery for immorality. But I am glad to say that lately an improvement has taken place. The great majority never saw the interior of a church, except on the occasion of a christening, or when they wanted the clergyman to sign a paper. They looked upon public worship as something  <Q>out of their line altogether.</Q>    I found persons who had not entered a place of worship for <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> years.   Drunkenness was a predominant vice in the district, not only with men, but equally with women.</QUOTE> 
   <P>For some considerable time past an agitation has been going on as to the desirability of having a bridge or subway near this spot, as a means of affording more direct communication between the <num value="2">two</num> sides of the river than at present exist. In <datestruct VALUE="1876-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct>, a meeting of the Court of Common Council was held, when the question was discussed, and the plans and estimates which had been prepared were carefully examined and considered. The site for a bridge which appeared to be most eligible to the court was that approached from Little Tower Hill and Irongate Stairs on the north side, and from Horselydown Stairs on the south side of the river.   Among the plans submitted was <num value="1">one</num> for a low-level bridge, the centre of which would consist of <num value="2">two</num> swing bridges on turntables in the centre, <num value="1">one</num> at each end of a pier, leaving waterway on each side for large vessels when the swings were open. This great undertaking, if carried out, will doubtless be the means of effecting a vast improvement in the locality above described.

<P>Readers of English history need scarcely be told how that King Henry VIII., in his selfish zeal for novelties in religion, laid violent hands on all the abbeys and other religious houses in the kingdom, except a very few, which were spared at the earnest petition of the people, or given up to the representatives of the original founders.   Before proceeding to the final suppression, under the pretext of checking the superstitious worshipping of images, he had laid bare their altars and stripped their shrines of everything that was valuable; nor did he spare the rich coffins and crumbling bones of the dead. Although <num value="400">four hundred</num> years had passed away since the murder of Thomas Becket <pb id="P.118" n="118">

 in Canterbury Cathedral, the venerated tomb was broken open, and a sort of criminal information was filed against the dead   saint, as <QUOTE>Thomas Becket, sometime Archbishop of Canterbury,</QUOTE> who was formally cited to appear in court and answer to the charges. As the saint did not appear at the bar of this earthly court, which was held in Westminster Hall in <datestruct value="1539--"><year reg="1539">1539</year></datestruct>, it was deemed proper to declare that <QUOTE>he was no saint whatever, but a rebel and traitor to his prince, and that therefore he, the king, strictly commanded that he should not be any longer esteemed or called a saint; that all images and pictures of him should be destroyed; and that his name and remembrance should be erased out of all books, under pain of his majesty's indignation, and imprisonment at his grace's pleasure.</QUOTE> Other shrines had been plundered before, and certain images and relics of saints had been broken to pieces publicly at St. Paul's Cross; but now every shrine was laid bare, or, if any escaped, it was owing to the poverty of their decorations and offerings. <QUOTE>In the final seizure of the abbeys and monasteries,</QUOTE> writes the author of the <QUOTE>Comprehensive History of England,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>the richest fell <num value="1">first</num>.   After Canterbury, Battle Abbey; Merton, in Surrey; Stratford, in Essex; Lewes, in Sussex; the Charterhouse, the Blackfriars, the Greyfriars, and the Whitefriars, in London, felt the fury of the same whirlwind, which gradually blew over the whole land, until, in the spring of the year <datestruct value="1540"><year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct>, all the monastic establishments of the kingdom   were suppressed, and the mass of their landed property was divided among courtiers and parasites   ...            All the abbeys were totally dismantled, except in the cases where they happened to be the parish churches also; as was the case at St. Albans, Tewkesbury, Malvern, and elsewhere, where they were rescued, in part by the petitions and pecuniary contributions of the pious inhabitants, who were averse to the worshipping of God in a stable.</QUOTE> Of the <QUOTE>lesser monasteries</QUOTE> which were thus ruthlessly swept away was the <LEMMA id="lemma.118.4">Abbey of Bermondsey</LEMMA>, which is now kept in remembrance mainly by the names given to a few streets which cover its site, and through which we are about to pass. 
   <P>The earliest mention of this abbey occurs in the account of Bermondsey in <QUOTE>Domesday,</QUOTE> from which may be gathered some idea of the solitude and seclusion which the place then enjoyed; when it is stated that there was <QUOTE>woodland</QUOTE> round about for the <QUOTE>pannage</QUOTE> of a certain number of hogs; and that there was also <QUOTE>a new and fair church, with <num value="20">twenty</num> acres of meadow.</QUOTE> Soon after the Norman conquest, a number of Cluniac monks settled in this country; and in <datestruct value="1082--"><year reg="1082">1082</year></datestruct> a wealthy citizen ot London, Aylwin Childe, founded a monastery at Bermondsey, which some of the ecclesiastics from the Monastery of La Charite, on the Loire, made their new home in the land of their adoption. 
    <P> <QUOTE>The Cluniacs,</QUOTE> says Mr. A. Wood in his <QUOTE>Ecclesiastical Antiquities,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>derived their name from   Clugni, in Burgundy, where Odo, an abbot in the <num value="10">tenth</num> century, reformed the Benedictine rule. Their habit was the same as the Benedictine.  The order was introduced into England in <datestruct value="1077--"><year reg="1077">1077</year></datestruct>, when a Cluniac house was established at Lewes, in  Sussex, under the protection of Earl Warenne, the  Conqueror's son-in-law. In the <num value="12">twelfth</num> century the  Abbey of Clugni was at the height of its reputation under Peter the Venerable (<datestruct value="1122--"><year reg="1122">1122</year></datestruct>-<datestruct value="1156--"><year reg="1156">1156</year></datestruct>).   From the <datestruct VALUE="-09-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct> till Lent, the Cluniacs had <num value="1">one</num> meal only a day, except during the octaves of Christmas and the Epiphany, when they had an extra meal.   Still eighteen poor were fed at their table. There were never more than <num value="20">twenty</num>  Cluniac houses in England, nearly all of them founded before the reign of Henry II. Until the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century, all the Cluniac houses were priories dependent on the parent house.   The  Prior of St. Pancras, Lewes, was the highchamber- lain, and frequently the vicar-general of the Abbey of Cluny, and exercised the functions of a Provincial in England.   The English houses were all governed by foreigners, and the monks were oftener of foreign than of English extraction. In the <num value="14">fourteenth</num>   century, however, there   was a change; many of the houses became denizen, and  Bermondsey was made an abbey.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The following   interesting   particulars of the customs of the Cluniac order are gathered from Stevens's translation of the French history of the monastic orders, given in his continuation of Dugdale, and transcribed in the great edition of the <QUOTE>Monasticon :</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>They every day sung <num value="2">two</num> solemn masses, at each of which a monk of <num value="1">one</num> of the choirs offered <num value="2">two</num> hosts.   If any <num value="1">one</num> would celebrate mass on Holy Thursday, before the solemn mass was sung, he made no use of light, because the new fire was not yet blessed. The preparation they used for making the bread which was to serve for the sacrifice of the altar is worthy to be observed. They <num value="1">first</num> chose the wheat, grain by grain, and washed it very carefully. Being put into a bag, appointed only for that use, a servant, known to be a just man, carried it to the mill, washed the grindstones, covered them with curtains above and below, and having put on himself an alb, covered his face with a veil, nothing but his eyes appearing.   The same pre-

 <pb id="P.119" n="119"> caution was used with the meal.   It was not boulted till it had been well washed; and the warden of the church, if he were either priest or deacon, finished the rest, being assisted by <num value="2">two</num> other religious men, who were in the same orders, and by a lay brother particularly appointed for that business.   These <num value="4">four</num> monks, when matins were ended, washed their faces and hands; the <num value="3">three</num> <num value="1">first</num> of them did put on albs; <num value="1">one</num> of them washed the meal with pure clean water, and the other <num value="2">two</num> baked the hosts in the iron moulds; so great was the veneration and respect the monks of Cluni paid to the Holy Eucharist.</QUOTE> The sites of the mill and the bakehouse of Bermondsey Abbey were both traceable as late as the year <datestruct value="1876"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>William Rufus enriched the abbey by the grant of the manor of Bermondsey; and the establishment soon became <num value="1">one</num> of the most important in  England.   In <datestruct value="1213--"><year reg="1213">1213</year></datestruct>, Prior Richard erected an almonry or hospital adjoining the monastery; but no traces of that now exist. The parish church of St. Mary Magdalen, rebuilt in <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>, at the junction of Bermondsey Street and Abbey Street, occupies nearly the site of the conventual church.  The monastic buildings were, doubtless, very extensive and magnificent; and the monks maintained a splendid hospitality and state.   Katherine of France, widow of Henry V., retired hither to mourn, perhaps the victor of Agincourt, to whose memory she had erected, in Westminster Abbey, a life-sized silver-gilt statue; or it may have been her <num value="2">second</num> husband, Owen Tudor, who perhaps little thought he would ever become the progenitor of <num value="2">two</num> of the greatest monarchs who ever sat on the English throne-bluff King  Henry and Queen Bess, not to mention Henry's father, the conqueror of crook-backed Richard, and Elizabeth's boy-brother and her sister Mary.  Katherine died at Bermondsey, a double widow, in <datestruct VALUE="1437-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1437">1437</year></datestruct>.   In the convent here Elizabeth  Woodville, the widow of Edward IV., was shut up as a sort of prisoner by Henry VII., shortly after the marriage of the latter with her daughter  Elizabeth. The Queen Dowager died in <datestruct value="1492--"><year reg="1492">1492</year></datestruct>.  A few days before her death she made her will, and a pathetic document it is. Her son-in-law,  Henry VII., cruelly neglected her; and when in after years he ordered an anniversary service to be sung on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, by the monks of  Bermondsey, for the repose of the souls of his late queen and children, his father and his mother, he forgot to include poor Elizabeth, the mother of his wife, once queen of England, but who ended her days almost a pauper in the very abbey where the stately service was performed. 
     <P>As a glimpse of what was sometimes doing in the old church, as well as of the old custom itself the following extract will be found interesting : <QUOTE>The abbot and convent of St. Saviour of Bermondsey shall provide at every such anniversary a hearse, to be set in the midst of the high chancel of the same monastery before the high altar, covered and apparelled with the best and most honourable stuff in the same monastery convenient for the same.   And also <num value="4">four</num> tapers of wax, each of them   weighing <measure value="8l." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num> pounds</measure>, to be set about the same hearse, that is to say, on either side thereof <num value="1">one</num> taper, and at either end of the same hearse another taper, and all the same <num value="4">four</num> tapers to be lighted and burning continually during all the time of every such <hi rend=italics>Placebo, Dirige</hi>, with <num value="9">nine</num> lessons, lauds and mass of <hi rend=italics>Requiem</hi>, with the prayers and obeisances above rehearsed.</QUOTE> 
    <P>At the dissolution of the monasteries, Bermondsey  Abbey, with its rich manor, was seized--as was the case with other similar places-by Henry VIII.  At that time the Abbot of Bermondsey had no very tender scruples about conscience or principle, like so many of his brethren, but arranged everything in the pleasantest possible manner for the king; and he had his reward. While the poor monks had pensions varying from <measure value="5l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5">5</num></measure> <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> to  <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> a year each allowed them, the good Lord  Abbot's pension amounted to <measure value="336l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="336">336</num></measure> <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure>   The monastery itself, with the manor, demesnes, &amp;c., were granted by the Crown to Sir Robert Southwell, Master of the Rolls, who sold them to Sir  Thomas Pope, the founder of Trinity College,  Oxford.   In <datestruct value="1545--"><year reg="1545">1545</year></datestruct> Sir Thomas pulled down the old priory church, and built Bermondsey House upon the site and with the materials. Here died, in <datestruct value="1583--"><year reg="1583">1583</year></datestruct>, Thomas Radcliffe, Earl of Sussex, Lord  Chamberlain to Queen Elizabeth.   This was the  Earl of Sussex who, according to Sir Walter Scott in his interesting romance of <QUOTE>Kenilworth,</QUOTE> was visited by <QUOTE>Master</QUOTE> Tressilian at Sayes Court,  Deptford, and restored from a dangerous illness by the skill of Wayland Smith, to the great wonder of Walter Raleigh and Sir Thomas Blount. About  <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>, the east gate of the monastery was removed; and early in the present century nearly all that was left of the old buildings shared the same fate, and Abbey Street was built upon the site.   The  Neckinger Road-at a short distance southward of Jacob's Island, Dockhead, and the other waterside places mentioned towards the close of the preceding chapter-marks the ancient water-course, formerly navigable as far as the precincts of the abbey.   This road, which is at the junction of Parker's Row with Jamaica Road, leads westward, <pb id="P.120" n="120"> by Abbey Street and Long Lane, into the Borough High Street, close by St. George's Church. This, then, is the spot on which the ancient monastery once flourished; there are, however, scarcely any remains of the conventual building left standing, and a walk over the site of the great abbey of the Cluniacs can now afford but little gratification. The entire site is now pretty well covered over with modern houses and dirty streets and courts. 
    <P> <QUOTE>The Long Walk,</QUOTE> as Charles Knight pleasantly suggests in his <QUOTE>London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>was once perhaps a fine shady avenue, where the abbot or his monks were accustomed to while away the summer afternoon, but is about <num value="1">one</num> of the last places that would now tempt the wandering footstep of the stranger; the  <Q> Grange Walk</Q>  no longer leads to the pleasant farm or park of the abbey, and is in itself but a painful mockery of the associations roused by the name; the  <Q>Court,</Q>  or Base Courtyard, is changed into Bermondsey Square, flanked on all sides by small tenements, the handiwork of the builders who completed a few years ago what Sir Thomas Pope began; and though some trees are yet there, of so ancient appearance that, for aught we know, they may have witnessed the destruction of the very conventual church, yet they are dwindling and dwindling away, as though they

 felt themselves a part of the old abbey, and had no business to survive its destruction. They will not have much longer to wait; little remains to be destroyed.   In the Grange Walk is a part of the gate-house of the east gateway, with a portion of the rusted hinge of the monastic doors. In Long Walk, on the right, is a small and filthy quadrangle (once called, from some tradition connected with the visits of the early English monarchs to Bermondsey, King John's Court, now Bear Yard) in which are a few dilapidated houses, where the stonework, and form and antiquity of the windows, afford abundant evidence of their connection with the monastery. Lastly, in the churchyard of the present church of St. Mary Magdalen are some pieces of the wall that surrounded the gardens and church of the Cluniacs.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Although Bermondsey is, perhaps, not the most civilised and scholastic part of London now, it is no small credit to the churchmen of the early Norman times, that, according to Fitzstephen, as interpreted to us by honest John Stow, the <num value="3">three</num> earliest schools for youth in London and its neighbourhood were founded under the shadows respectively of Old St. Paul's, of St. Peter's Abbey, Westminster, and of the Abbey of Bermondsey.

   <P><LEMMA id="lemma.121.1">The church of St. Mary Magdalen</LEMMA>, at the corner of Abbey Street and Bermondsey Street, stands on the site of the ancient conventual church.

The church contains no monuments worthy of note. In <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct> the tower was repaired and <QUOTE>beautified</QUOTE> after the usual <QUOTE>churchwarden</QUOTE> fashion of the period, and at the same time the Gothic windows were restored, and since that date the church has been re-seated, and otherwise greatly improved.

   <P>In this church is a very curious ancient salver of silver, now used for the collection of the alms at the offertory. On the centre is a beautifullychased representation of the gate of a castle or town, with <num value="2">two</num> figures, a knight kneeling before a lady, who is about to place his helmet on his head. The long-pointed solleretts of the feet, the ornaments of the armpits, and the form of the helmet, are supposed to mark the date of the salver as that of Edward II. The other memorial to which we have referred is of a much more interesting character; it is thus recorded in the <QUOTE>Chronicle of Bermondsey:</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>Anno Domini   <datestruct value="1117--"><year reg="1117">1117</year></datestruct>.

The above-mentioned nobleman seems to have had a perfect faith in the truth of the miracle; for the chronicle subsequently states: <QUOTE>In the year <datestruct value="1140"><year reg="1140">1140</year></datestruct> William Earl of Morton came to Bermondsey, and assumed the monastic habit.</QUOTE> In our account of old St. Paul's Cathedral<NOTE>See   Vol. I., p. <num value="243">243</num>.</NOTE>   we have spoken of the scene which was witnessed at Paul's Cross on the breaking up of the <QUOTE>Rood of Grace,</QUOTE> which had been brought from Boxley Abbey, in Kent; and we may mention here that the degradation of the <QUOTE>Rood of Bermondsey</QUOTE> formed, as it were, an appendix to that day's proceedings. A reference to this transaction is to be found in an ancient diary of a citizen, preserved among the Cottonian MSS., under the date of <datestruct value="1558--"><year reg="1558">1558</year></datestruct>, in the following passage:-- <QUOTE>M. Gresham, Mayor. On Saint Matthew's day, the Apostle, the <datestruct VALUE="-02-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> day of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, Sunday, did the Bishop of Rochester preach al Paul's Cross, and had standing afore him all his sermon time the picture of Rood of Grace ir Kent, and was <hi rend=italics>[ie</hi>. which had been] greatly soughi with pilgrims; and when he had made an end of his sermon, was torn all in pieces; then wag the picture of Saint Saviour, that had stood ir Barmsey Abbey many years, in Southwark, taker down.</QUOTE> The word <QUOTE>picture,</QUOTE> it may be stated, was often used in the widest sense to express an image or statue; and it may be remarked, with reference to the Rood in Bermondsey Abbey, that the words are <QUOTE>taken down,</QUOTE> not that it was actually destroyed.   In front of the building attached to the chief or north gate of the abbey was a rude representation of a small cross, with some zigzag ornamentation; the whole had the appearance of being something placed upon or let into the wall, and not a part of the original building; and there it remained till the comparatively recent destruction of this last remnant of the monastic pile.   In a drawing made of the remains of the   Abbey in <datestruct value="1679--"><year reg="1679">1679</year></datestruct>, which was afterwards engraved by   Wilkinson, in his <QUOTE>Londinia Illustrata,</QUOTE> the same cross appears in the same situation; from this it has been conjectured, apart from the corroborative evidence of tradition, that this was the old Saxon cross found near the Thames, or that it was a part of the <QUOTE>picture</QUOTE> before which pilgrims used to congregate in the old conventual church. 
     <P>In Wilkinson's work above mentioned is engraved a ground-plan of the site and precincts of   Bermondsey Abbey, copied from a survey made in <datestruct value="1679--"><year reg="1679">1679</year></datestruct>. It exhibits a ground-plot of the old conventual church, with gardens enclosed by stone walls, and bounded on the north by the churchyard of St. Mary Magdalen; the west and north gates, leading into the <QUOTE>base court-yard,</QUOTE> the site of the mansion, with its long gallery, built by Sir   Thomas Pope; and the east gate, leading into <QUOTE>Grange</QUOTE> Walk. In the same work is a general view of the remains of the monastic and other old buildings, with the adjacent country, taken in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, from the steeple of the adjoining church, and also an east view of the ancient gateway, with several other engravings relating to the abbey and its attached buildings. The east gate of the monastery, in Grange Walk, was pulled down about the middle of the last century. We learn from   Brayley's <QUOTE>History of Surrey,</QUOTE> that <QUOTE>the great gate-house, or principal entrance, the front of which was composed of squared flints and dark-red tiles, ranged alternately, was nearly entire in the year <datestruct value="1806"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>; but shortly afterwards it was completely demolished, together with nearly all the adjacent ancient buildings, and Abbey Street was erected on their site. The north gate led into the great close of the abbey, now   Bermondsey Square, and surrounded by modern houses.   Grange Road, which was built on the pasture-ground belonging to the monastery, commences near the south-west corner of the square, and extends to what was till lately the Grange Farm, and continues onward to the ancient water-course called the Neckinger, over which is a bridge, leading to the water-side division of the parish.   In <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct> the present churchyard <pb id="P.123" n="123"> (which had been previously extended in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>) was enlarged by annexing to it a strip of land <num value="16">sixteen</num> feet in width, that formed a part of the conventual burial-ground; in doing which many vestiges of sculpture were found, together with a stone coffin.</QUOTE> 
   <P>We may add that King Stephen was a great benefactor to the abbey, on which he bestowed broad lands in Writtle, near Chelmsford, in Essex, and in other places. 
   <P>In the previous chapter we have stated that Bermondsey, in a certain sense, may be regarded as a <QUOTE>region of manufacturers.</QUOTE> Indeed, for several centuries this locality has been the centre of the tanning and leather trades. But even this unsavoury trade has its advantages. When the Great Plague raged in the City of London, many of the terror-stricken creatures fled to the Bermondsey tan-pits, and found strong medicinal virtues in the nauseous smell.   The great leather market has been established on this spot for above <num value="200">200</num> years. Hat-making, too, is most extensively carried on; and it is said that in no place in the kingdom of equal area is there such a great variety of important manufactures. The intersection of the district by innumerable tidal ditches gave unusual facilities for the leather manufacture, but at the same time it also entailed frightful misery on the crowded inhabitants. If we draw a line from St. James's Church, in the Jamaica Road, to the intersection of the Grange Road with the Old Kent Road, we shall find to the west, or rather to the north-west, of that line, nearly the whole of the factories connected with the leather and wool trade of London. <QUOTE>A circle <num value="1">one</num> mile in diameter, having its centre at the spot where the abbey once stood,</QUOTE> says Charles Knight, in his <QUOTE>London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>will include within its limits most of the tanners, the curriers, the fellmongers, the woolstaplers, the leatherfactors, the leather-dressers, the leather-dyers, the parchment-makers, and the glue-makers, for which this district is so remarkable. There is scarcely a street, a road, a lane, into which we can turn without seeing evidences of <num value="1">one</num> or other of these occupations.   <num value="1">One</num> narrow   road-leading from   the Grange Road to the Kent Road--is particularly distinguishable for the number of leather-factories which it exhibits on either side; some time-worn and mean, others newly and   skilfully erected. Another street, known as Long Lane, and lying westward of the church, exhibits nearly <num value="20">twenty</num> distinct establishments where skins or hides undergo some of the many processes to which they are subjected. In Snow's Fields; in Bermondsey New Road; in Russell Street, Upper and Lower; in Willow Walk, and Page's Walk, and Grange Walk, and others whose names we cannot now remember --in all of these, leather, skins, and wool seem to be the commodities out of which the wealth of the inhabitants has been created.   Even the publichouses give note of these peculiarities by the signs chosen for them, such as the  <Q>Woolpack,</Q>  the  <Q>Fellmongers' Arms,</Q>   <Q> Simon   the Tanner,</Q>  and others of like import. If there is any district in London whose inhabitants might be excused for supporting the proposition that  <Q>There is nothing like leather,</Q>  surely Bermondsey is that place!</QUOTE> 
   <P>The old-established house, known as <QUOTE>Simon the Tanner,</QUOTE> is situated in Long Lane. The sign makes allusion, of course, to the tanner of Joppa, of whom we read in the Acts of the Apostles, as having St. Peter as his lodger. <QUOTE>The sign,</QUOTE> says Mr. Larwood, <QUOTE>is supposed to be unique.</QUOTE> 
   <P>From the following enumeration of some of the manufacturers in Bermondsey Street alone, it will be seen how many branches of industry are carried on here in connection with the leather trade: hidesellers, tanners, leather-dressers, morocco leather dressers, leather sellers and cutters, curriers, parchment-makers, wool-staplers, horsehair manufacturers, hair and flock manufacturers, patent hairfelt manufacturers. There are besides these skin and hide salesmen, fellmongers, leather-dyers, and glue-makers, in other parts of the vicinity. 
   <P>Bermondsey Market, the great emporium   for hides and skins, is in Weston Street, on the north side of Long Lane.   It was established on this spot about the year <datestruct value="1833"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>; and   the building, together with the ground whereon it stands, cost nearly   <measure value="50000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure>.   It is a long series of brick warehouses, lighted by a range of windows, and having an arched entrance gateway at either end. These entrances open into a quadrangle or court, covered for the most part with grass and surrounded by warehouses, and enclosing others for the stowage of hops. In the warehouses is transacted the business of a class of persons who are termed <QUOTE>leather factors,</QUOTE> who sell to the curriers or leather-sellers leather belonging to the tanners; or sell Londontanned leather to country purchasers, or countrytanned leather to London purchasers; in short, they are middle-men in the traffic in leather, as skin-salesmen are in the traffic in skins. Beyond this <num value="1">first</num> quadrangle is a <num value="2">second</num>, called the <QUOTE>Skin Depository,</QUOTE> and having <num value="4">four</num> entrances, <num value="2">two</num> from the larger quadrangle, and <num value="2">two</num> from a street leading into Bermondsey Street.   This depository is an oblong plot of ground terminated by semi-circular ends; it is pitched with common road-stones along the middle, and flagged round with a broad footpavement.   Over the pavement, through its whole <pb id="P.124" n="124"> extent, is an arcade supported by pillars; and the portion of pavement included between every <num value="2">two</num> contiguous pillars is called a <QUOTE>bay.</QUOTE> There are about <num value="50">fifty</num> of these <QUOTE>bays,</QUOTE> which are let out to skin-salesmen at about <measure value="15l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="15">15</num></measure> per annum each; and on the pavement of his bay the salesman exposes the skins which he is commissioned to sell. Here on market-days may be seen a busy scene of traffic between the salesmen on the <num value="1">one</num> hand and the fellmongers on the other. The carts, laden with sheepskins, come rattling into the place, and draw up in the roadway of the depository; the loads are taken out, and ranged on the pavement of the bays; the sellers and buyers make their bargains; the purchase-money is paid into the hands of the salesman, and by him transmitted to the butcher; and the hides or skins are removed to the yards of the buyers. 
    <P>As was supposed, when the New Skin Market was built, the trade in hides, as well as that in skins, has come to be carried on here. A large quantity of ox-hides, however, from   which the thicker kinds of leather are made, are still sold at  Leadenhall Market, which was long the centre of this trade; and nearly all the leather manufacturers in Bermondsey are still proprietors in that market. 
    <P>The whole of the fellmongers belonging to the metropolis are congregated within a small circle around the Skin Market in Weston Street. It forms no part of the occupation of these persons to convert the sheepskins into leather. The skins pass into their hands with the wool on, just as they are taken from the sheep; and the fellmonger then proceeds to remove the wool from the pelt, and to cleanse the latter from some of the impurities with which it is coated. 
    <P> <QUOTE>The   produce of the fellmongers' labours,</QUOTE> writes Charles Knight, <QUOTE>passes into the hands of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> other classes of manufacturers, such as the wool-stapler, the leather-dresser, and the parchment-maker. The wool-stapiers, <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> in number, are, like the fellmongers, located almost without a single exception in Bermondsey. They are wool dealers, who purchase the commodity as taken from the skins, and sell it to the hatters, the woollen and worsted manufacturers, and others. They are scarcely to be denominated manufacturers, since the wool passes through their hands without undergoing any particular change or preparation; it is sorted into various qualities, and, like the foreign wool, packed in bags for the market. In a street called Russell Street, intersecting Bermondsey Street, the large warehouses of these wool-staplers may be seen in great number; tiers of ware or store-rooms, with cranes over them; wagons in the yard beneath; huge bags filled with wool, some arriving and others departingthese are the appearances which a wool-warehouse presents. It may, perhaps, not be wholly unnecessary to observe that the sheep's wool here spoken of is only that portion which is taken from the pelt or skin of the slaughtered animal, and which is known by the name of skin-wool. The portion which is taken from the animal during life, and which is called  <Q>shear wool,</Q>  possesses qualities in some respects different from the former, and passes through various hands.

    <P>Russell Street, in which we have now found ourselves, perpetuates the name of a somewhat eccentric individual who lived in Bermondsey in the latter part of the last century-Mr. Richard Russell, who died at his house in this parish, in <datestruct VALUE="1784-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>,  <year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct>.   In   Manning and   Bray's <QUOTE>History of  Surrey</QUOTE> we read that he was a bachelor, that he desired to be buried in the church of St. John,  Horselydown, and that <QUOTE>he left, amongst other legacies, to the Magdalen Hospital, <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure>; to the Small-pox Hospital, <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure>; to the Lying-in  Hospital, near Westminster Bridge, <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure>; to the Surrey Dispensary, <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> ; for a monument in  St. John's Church, <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>; to each of <num value="6">six</num> young women to attend as pall-bearers at his funeral,  <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure>; to <num value="4">four</num> other young women to precede his corpse and strew flowers whilst the  <Q>Dead March</Q>  in <hi rend=italics>Saul</hi> was played by the organist of St. John's, each <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>; to the Rev.

   <P>In Russell Street is St. Olave's Union, which consists of some extensive ranges of buildings, forming a large square court, and covering a con- <pb id="P.125" n="125">  siderable space of ground.

    <P>Retracing our steps through Bermondsey Street, and by Star Corner, we make our way to the south side of the Grange Road, mentioned above. Here we again encounter evidences of the manufacturing industry of Bermondsey, in the shape of its tanyards-another of the numerous branches of trade arising out of the leather manufacture, which gives to Bermondsey so many of its characteristics.   In Willow Walk, and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> other places in the vicinity, may be seen instances of <num value="1">one</num> of the purposes to which tan is appropriated. A large plot of ground contains, in addition to heaps of tan, skeleton frames about <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> feet in height, consisting of a range of shelves <num value="1">one</num> above another; and on these shelves are placed the oblong, rectangular pieces of <QUOTE>tan-turf,</QUOTE> with which the middle classes have not much to do, but which are extensively purchased for fuel, at <QUOTE><num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> for a penny,</QUOTE> by the humbler classes. 
   <P> <QUOTE>All the tanneries in London, with, we believe, <num value="1">one</num> exception,</QUOTE> says Charles Knight, <QUOTE>are situated in Bermondsey, and all present nearly the same features. Whoever has resolution enough to brave the appeals to his organ of smell, and visit <num value="1">one</num> of these places, will see a large area of groundsometimes open above, and in other cases covered by a roof-intersected by pits or oblong cisterns, whose upper edges are level with the ground. These cisterns are the tan-pits, in which hides are exposed to the action of liquid containing oak-bark. He will see, perhaps, in <num value="1">one</num> corner of the premises, a heap of ox and cow-horns, just removed from the hide, and about to be sold to the comb-makers, the knife-handle makers, and other manufacturers. He will see in another corner a heap of refuse matter about to be consigned to the gluemanu- facturer. In a covered building he will find a heap of hides exposed to the action of lime, for loosening the hair with which the pelt is covered; and in an adjoining building he will probably see a number of men scraping the surfaces of the hides to prepare them for the tan-pits. In many of the tanneries, though not all, he will see stacks of spent tan, no longer useful in the tannery, but destined for fuel or manure, or gardeners' hot-beds.   In airy buildings he will see the tanned leather hanging up to dry, disposed in long ranges of rooms or galleries.   Such are the features which all the tanneries, with some minor differences, exhibit.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Between Willow Walk and the Old Kent Road, and stretching away from   Page's Walk on the north-west to Upper Grange Road on the southeast, is the Bricklayers' Arms Station, the principal luggage and goods depot of the South-Eastern Railway. In the station itself, from an architectural point of view, there is nothing requiring special mention.   The arrangements for the reception and delivery of the goods at this station are in nowise remarkable, nor are there any warehouses or stores worthy of particular notice. The site was purchased by the South-Eastern Railway Company in <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>, and the lines of railway laid across the market-gardens of Bermondsey, in order to form a junction with the main line near New Cross.   Besides being used as a heavy goods dep<num value="6">6</num>t, the <LEMMA id="lemma.125.1">Bricklayers' Arms Station</LEMMA> was for many years--in fact, until the erection of the station at Charing Cross-used as the terminus for the arrival and departure of foreign potentates visiting this country, and also for members of our own Royal Family going abroad. Hither the body of the Duke of Wellington was brought by rail from Walmer Castle, in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, in order to be conveyed to Chelsea Hospital, preparatory to its interment in St. Paul's Cathedral. 
   <P>It is mentioned in the histories of England that shortly after the battle of Edgehill the Common Council of London passed an act for fortifying the City, which was done with such dispatch, that a rampart, with bastions, redoubts, and other bulwarks, was shortly erected round the cities of London and Westminster and the borough of Southwark. It has been suggested that Fort Road --the thoroughfare running parallel with Blue Anchor Road, on the south side, from   Upper Grange Road to St. James's Road--may mark the site of some of the fortifications here referred to. 
   <P>A glance at a map of London of half a century ago-or, indeed, much more recently--will show that nearly the whole of the land hereabouts consisted of market-gardens and open fields. At a short distance eastward of the Upper Grange Road, and south of the Blue Anchor Road, stood a windmill, the site of which is now covered by part of Lynton Road. On the east side of the abbey enclosures was the farm known as <QUOTE>The Grange,</QUOTE> after which the Grange Road and Grange Walkare named; and near the Grange wound the narrow tide-stream or ditch called the Neckinger, which was here spanned by a bridge.   The Neckinger was formerly navigable, for small craft, from the Thames to the abbey precincts, and gives name to the Neckinger Road. When the abbey was destroyed, and the ground passed into the possession of others, the houses which were built on the site still received a supply of water from this <pb id="P.126" n="126"> water-course. In process of time tanneries were established on the spot, most probably on account of the valuable supply of fresh water obtainable every <num value="12">twelve</num> hours from the river. <QUOTE>There appears reason to believe,</QUOTE> says Charles Knight, <QUOTE>that the Neckinger was by degrees made to supply other ditches, or small water-courses, cut in different directions, and placed in communication with it; for, provided they were all nearly on a level, each high tide would as easily fill half a dozen as a single <num value="1">one</num>.   Had there been no mill at the mouth of the channel, the supply might have gone on continuously; but the mill continued to be moved by the stream, and to be held by parties who neither had nor felt any interest in the affairs of the Neckinger manufacturers. Disagreements thence arose; and we find that, towards the end of the last century, the tanners of the central parts of Bermondsey instituted a suit against the owner of the mill for shutting off the tide when it suited his own purpose so to do to the detriment of the leather manufacturers. The ancient usages of the district were brought forward in evidence, and the result was that the right of the inhabitants to a supply

 of water from   the   river, at every   high tide, was confirmed to the discomfiture of the millowner.   Since that period there were occasional disagreements between the manufacturers and the owners of the mill respecting the closing of sluicegates, the repair and cleansing of the ditch, and the construction of wooden bridges across it; but the tide, with few exceptions, still continued to flow daily to and fro from the Thames to the neighbourhood of the Grange and Neckinger Roads. Many of the largest establishments in Bermondsey were for years dependent on the tide-stream for the watervery abundant in quantity-required in the manufacture of leather. Other manufacturers, however, constructed artesian wells on their premises, while the mill at the mouth of the stream was worked by steam power, so that the channel itself became much   less   important than   in   former times. Latterly this ditch, or  <Q>tide-stream,</Q>  as it was sometimes called, was under the management of commissioners, consisting of the principal manufacturers, who were empowered to levy a small rate for its maintenance and repair.</QUOTE>

     <P>An attempt was made in the latter part of the last century to raise Bermondsey to the dignity of a fashionable watering-place.   Although that portion of the district near the river was so close and filthy, there were, as stated above, pleasant fields stretching away towards the Kent Road.   The abbot's fat meadows were still green; and, indeed, a singular characteristic of the eastern parts of Bermondsey to this day (especially noticeable from the railway) is the strange mingling of factories, in which the most offensive trades are vigorously carried on, with market-gardens and green fields. In <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>   a chalybeate spring was discovered in some grounds adjoining the Grange   Road, of which advantage was taken by the proprietor with the view of inducing the waterdrinkers and the lovers of a fashionable lounge and promenade to resort thither, and in that manner caused this district to become for a brief interval what Hampstead<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="469">469</num>.</NOTE> had just ceased to be-a favourite suburban watering-place. In the <hi rend=italics>Era</hi>
  Almanac, for <datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>, it is stated that a public-house called the <QUOTE>Waterman's Arms</QUOTE> having become vacant, an artist, Mr. Thomas Keyse, purchased it, in <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct>, along with some adjoining grounds, and formed it for the amusements of a <QUOTE>teagarden.</QUOTE> He ornamented it with his own paintings, and the discovery in the grounds of a mineral spring, which was found to be an excellent chalybeate, so increased the attractions of the gardens that Bermondsey found the word <QUOTE>Spa</QUOTE> added to its name. On application to the Surrey magistrates in <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct>, Mr. Keyse obtained a licence for music at his gardens, and this, with an expenditure of   <measure value="4000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4000">4,000</num></measure>     on their decorations, gave them a considerable popularity. The space before the orchestra, which was about a quarter of the size of that at Vauxhall, was totally destitute of trees, the few that the gardens could then boast being planted merely as a screen to prevent the outside public from overlooking the interior of the place. The paintings executed by Keyse himself long existed, and were exhibited in an oblong room known as the <QUOTE>Picture Gallery;</QUOTE> they were chiefly representations of a butcher's shop, a greengrocer's shop, and so forth, all the details being worked out with Dutch minuteness. 
   <P>Mr. J. T. Smith, in his <QUOTE>Book for a Rainy Day,</QUOTE> tells us how, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, he was induced to pay a visit to this place, and how, when he reached the <QUOTE>Picture Gallery,</QUOTE> he at <num value="1">first</num> considered himself the only spectator.   When he had gone the round of the gallery he voluntarily re-commenced his view, but what followed will be best told in Mr.   Smith's own words :-- <QUOTE>Stepping back to study the picture of the  <Q>Green-stall,</Q>   <Q>I ask your pardon,</Q>  said I, for I had trodden upon some <num value="1">one</num>'s toes.    <Q>Sir, it is granted,</Q>  replied a little thick-set man, with a round face, arch look, and closely-curled wig, surmounted by a small <num value="3">three</num>-cornered hat put very knowingly on <num value="1">one</num> side, not unlike Hogarth's head in his print of the  <Q>Gates of Calais.</Q>   <Q> You are an artist, I presume; I noticed you from the end of the gallery, when you <num value="1">first</num> stepped back to look at my best picture. I painted all the objects in this room from nature and still life.</Q>   <Q>Your <Q>Greengrocer's Shop</Q>, </Q>  said I,  <Q> is inimitable; the drops of water on that savoy appear as if they had just fallen from the element. Van Huysum could not have pencilled them with greater delicacy.</Q>   <Q> What do you think,</Q>  said he,  <Q> of my <Q>Butcher's Shop?</Q></Q>     <Q> Your pluck is bleeding fresh, and your sweetbread is in a clean plate.</Q>   <Q> How do you like my bull's eye?</Q>   <Q>Why, it would be a most excellent <num value="1">one</num> for   Adams or Dollond to lecture upon. Your knuckle of veal is the finest I ever saw.</Q>   <Q> It's young meat,</Q>  replied he;  <Q> any <num value="1">one</num> who is a judge of meat can tell that from the blueness of its bone.</Q>   <Q> What a beautiful white you have used on the fat of that   Southdown leg! or is it Bagshot?</Q>   <Q> Yes,</Q>  said he,    <Q>my solitary visitor, it is Bagshot; and as for my white, that is the best Nottingham, which you or any artist can procure at Stone and Puncheon's, in   Bishopsgate Street Within.   Sir Joshua Reynolds,</Q>  continued Mr. Keyse,  <Q>paid me <num value="2">two</num> visits. On the <num value="2">second</num>, he asked me what white I had used; and when I told him, he observed, <Q>It's very extraordinary, sir, how it keeps so bright; I use the same.</Q>   <Q>Not at all, sir</Q> I rejoined: <Q>the doors of this gallery are open day and night; and the admission of fresh air, together with the great expansion of light from the sashes above, will never suffer the white to turn yellow. Have you not observed, Sir Joshua, how white the posts and rails on the public roads are, though they have not been re-painted for years?-that arises from constant air and bleaching.</Q>   Come,</Q>  said Mr. Keyse, putting his hand upon my shoulder,  <Q>the bell rings, not for prayers, nor for dinner, but for the song.</Q>  As soon as we had reached the orchestra the singer curtsied to us, for we were the only persons in the gardens.    <Q>This is sad work,</Q>  said he,  <Q>but the woman must sing, according to our <pb id="P.129" n="129"> contract.</Q>  I recollect that the singer was handsome, most dashingly dressed, immensely plumed, and villanously rouged; she smiled as she sang, but it was not the bewitching smile of Mrs. Wrighten, then applauded by thousands at Vauxhall Gardens. As soon as the Spa lady had ended her song, Keyse, after joining me in applause, apologised for doing so, by observing that as he never suffered his servants to applaud, and as the people in the road (whose ears were close to the cracks in the paling to hear the song) would make a bad report if they had not heard more than the clapping of <num value="1">one</num> pair of hands, he had in this instance expressed his reluctant feelings.   As the lady retired from the front of the orchestra, she, to keep herself in practice, curtsied to me with as much respect as she would had Colonel Topham been the patron of a gala-night.    <Q>This is too bad,</Q>  again observed Mr. Keyse,  <Q>and I am sure you cannot expect fireworks I</Q>    However, he politely asked me to partake of a bottle of Lisbon, which upon my refusing, he pressed me to accept of a catalogue of his pictures. Blewitt, the scholar of Jonathan Battishill, was the composer for the Spa establishment.   The following verse is perhaps the <num value="1">first</num> of his most admired composition:--

Keyse died about <num value="16">sixteen</num> years later, and their popularity having waned away, the gardens were shut up in <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct>, leaving the modern Spa Road to perpetuate their name. There are a few <QUOTE>tokens</QUOTE> of the place extant; and the locality is also kept in remembrance by the <QUOTE>Spa Road</QUOTE> Station on the Greenwich Railway. 
    <P> <QUOTE>What was once the suburbs of London,</QUOTE> says the author of <QUOTE>Walks round London</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE>but which now forms an integral part of the town itself, was, in days long gone by, famous for its wells, of real or imaginary virtues. Springs, or holy wells, generally had their existence near some abbey, monastery, or religious house, and often formed no trifling addition to the revenues of the pious dwellers in those edifices. These wells have, with few exceptions, sunk into total disuse. In the south there was the long famous Bermondsey Spa.   In the east was Holy Well, which has given its name to a neighbourhood.   Not far distant was St.  Agnes-le-Clair, still resorted to as a bath. On the northern side of the metropolis is Chad's Well, in  Gray's Inn Road; Islington Spa, still of some account, and where in <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct> the Princesses Caroline and Amelia are said to have drank the waters; Bagnigge Wells, and Clerk's, or Clerkenwell-all famous in their day. A <num value="2">second</num> Holy Well was near the Strand, and many others have sunk into oblivion.</QUOTE> 
   <P>At the corner of Neckinger and Spa Roads are some public baths and wash-houses. These institutions, which are now to be met with in almost every part of London, as well as in the country, originated in a public meeting held at the Mansion House in <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>, when a large subscription was raised to build an establishment to serve as a model for others, which it was anticipated would be erected, when it had been proved that the receipts, at the very low rate of charge contemplated, would be sufficient to cover the expenses, and gradually to repay the capital invested. The success of the bathing department in these establishments, as well as the necessity which existed for such means of cleanliness among the industrial classes, is to be found in the numbers who have used them since their <num value="1">first</num> opening. 
   <P>At the junction of Neckinger Road with the Jamaica Road is Parker's Row, at the southern end of which stands Christ Church, a brick-built edifice, of Romanesque architecture, erected in <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct>, from   the designs of Messrs. Allen and Hayes. It was built chiefly out of the Southwark Church and School Fund. At the north-western corner of Parker's Row is a large Roman Catholic church and convent. <QUOTE>It is a curious circumstance,</QUOTE> writes Charles Knight, in his work quoted above, <QUOTE>and <num value="1">one</num> in which the history of many changes of opinion may be read, that within <num value="40">forty</num> years after what remained of the magnificent ecclesiastical foundation of the abbey of Bermondsey had been swept away, a new conventual establishment rose up, amidst the surrounding desecration of factories and warehouses, in a large and picturesque pile, with its stately church, fitted in every way for the residence and accommodation of <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> inmates--the Convent of the Sisters of Mercy.</QUOTE> This edifice, then, which was founded in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>, was the <num value="1">first</num> convent of the Sisters of Mercy established in the metropolis. The convent adjoins the Roman Catholic Church of the Most Holy Trinity, which was built from the designs of Mr. A. W. Pugin. The <num value="1">first</num> stone of the church was laid in <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, by Dr. Bramston, the then Vicar-Apostolic of the London district, and it was formally opened in the following year. The church is a fine brick-built structure, in the Early Pointed style of Gothic architecture.   The plot of ground on which it stands was purchased at the expense of a benevolent lady, the Baroness <pb id="P.130" n="130"> Montesquieu, who also bought and furnished a well-built house adjoining. 
    <P>The convent of the Sisters of Mercy is also in the Gothic style of architecture, in keeping with the church. Lady Barbara Eyre contributed no less than <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> towards its erection. Considerable additions were made to the edifice in <datestruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct>-<num value="7">7</num>.  In addition to a large school conducted by the <QUOTE>religious</QUOTE> of Our Lady of Mercy, there are <num value="4">four</num> other numerously-attended Roman Catholic schools in this district.

The accompanying diagram, which represents the number of lines of railway seen at a point about a mile east of the London Bridge Station, will give some idea of what this traffic really is.  A passenger travelling over this particular spot will see <num value="8">eight</num> lines of rails, besides the <num value="1">one</num> on which he is travelling, and over nearly all these lines trains are constantly passing.  This is more than double the width of any other railway in England, the utmost number of pairs of rails seen elsewhere being <num value="4">four</num>.  The line numbered No. <num value="1">1</num> is the up line from Greenwich, which, to avoid crossing from side to side at a point more distant is on the left hand instead of the right; the down line to Greenwich being the same as that used for the North Kent, Mid Kent, &amp;c. (No. <num value="2">2</num>). No. <num value="3">3</num> is the North Kent and Mid Kent up line.   Over No. <num value="4">4</num> run the main line and many of the suburban down trains of the Brighton Company, as well as a few trains of The South-Eastern Company.  No. <num value="7">7</num> is the South London down line to Victoria, Sutton, &amp;c.  Till about the year <datestruct value="1868"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>, when the South London line was opened, there were <num value="6">six</num> lines of rails running side by side for the <num value="1">first</num> mile and a half from London Bridge. The South London <num value="1">first</num> branches off on the right, and at some distance lower down Nos. <num value="4">4</num>, <num value="5">5</num>, and <num value="6">6</num> diverge from Nos, <num value="1">1</num>, <num value="2">2</num>, <num value="3">3</num>; and a short distance further, the North Kent line parts company with the Greenwich, which for the rest of the distance pursues its course alone to Deptford and Greenwich.   Between <num value="6">6</num>.<num value="0">0</num> a.m. and <num value="12">12</num>.<num value="0">0</num> midnight, over line No. <num value="2">2</num> pass daily about <num value="48">48</num> trains to Greenwich, about <num value="21">21</num> for the Mid Kent Branch,

 about <num value="60">60</num> for the North Kent line, and about <num value="26">26</num> of the South-Eastern main line trains: total, <num value="155">155</num>.   Over No. <num value="4">4</num>, during the same period, run <num value="21">21</num> main line trains of the Brighton Company, about <num value="75">75</num> trains for Croydon, Crystal Palace, and Victoria; and about <num value="15">15</num> of the South-Eastern Company's trains to Red Hill, &amp;c.: total, <num value="111">111</num>.   Over No. <num value="7">7</num> also pass <num value="63">63</num> trains to Victoria, <hi rend=italics>via</hi> Peckham, and   <num value="36">36</num> to Wimbledon, Sutton, Croydon, and Clapham   Junction, &amp;c.: total, <num value="99">99</num>. Thus, without reckoning the extra trains on Saturdays, we have the astonishing number of <num value="365">365</num> trains running daily, in <num value="1">one</num> direction, over <num value="3">three</num> lines of railway for comparatively short distances; and if to this number we add the return trains running over lines Nos.   <num value="1">1</num>, <num value="3">3</num>, <num value="5">5</num>, <num value="6">6</num>, <num value="8">8</num>, <num value="9">9</num>, we have more than <num value="700">700</num> trains running for the accommodation of persons residing principally in the southern suburbs of London. 
    <P>In   Drummond Road, close by St. James's  Church, is the biscuit factory of Messrs. Peek,  Frean, and Co. The manufactory covers a large space of ground immediately on the north side of the railway, near the Spa Road Station. It comprises several high blocks of buildings, for the most part connected with each other, and gives employment to a very large number of hands.   In the centre of the building is a lofty clock-tower. 
    <P>The Blue Anchor Road-so named from   a tavern bearing that sign, at the corner of Blue Anchor Lane-commences at the Grange Road, and winding in a north-easterly direction under the railway, and so on to the end of the Jamaica Road, forms the boundary between the parishes of Bermondsey and Rotherhithe.   In a map of London and its environs, published in <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, and also in Coghlan's map (<datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>), the whole of this thoroughfare, which in those times had but few houses built along it, is marked as <QUOTE>Blue Anchor Road;</QUOTE> but in the Post Office Directory of the present day, that part of the road lying northward of the railway is called <QUOTE>Jamaica Level,</QUOTE> the west side being entered as belonging to the parish of Bermondsey, and the east side to that of Rotherhithe. In the maps above mentioned a narrow   roadway running eastward   across   the market-gardens is marked as the <QUOTE>Galley Wall.</QUOTE> This thoroughfare, which diverges from the Blue Anchor Road at the point where the latter passes under the railway, is now almost entirely built upon on both sides, and has been for many years known as the Manor Road.   In the early part of the year <datestruct value="1877"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>, however, the Commissioners of the Board of Works caused it to resume its original name of <QUOTE>Galley Wall.</QUOTE> What may have been the origin of that name it is now somewhat <pb id="P.132" n="132"> difficult to decide.   Close by the eastern end of this roadway there was till within the last few years a narrow canal or ditch winding its sluggish course   from   the Thames, across the Deptford Road, and through the fields and market-gardens, in a south-westerly direction. This ditch, although for the most part now filled up and obliterated, is the boundary line separating the counties of Kent and Surrey. 
   <P>It is said by historians that in order to reduce London, Knut cut a trench or canal through the marshes on the south of the Thames; and Maitland considered that he had discovered its course, from its <QUOTE>influx into the Thames at the lower end of Chelsea Reach</QUOTE> through the Spring Garden at Vauxhall, by the Black Prince at Kennington, and the south of Newington Butts, and across the Deptford Road, to its <QUOTE>outflux where the great wet dock below Rotherhithe is situated.</QUOTE> 
   <P>It is quite possible that Maitland was rather credulous, like many other antiquaries and topographers; though certainly it ought to be added that he does not <QUOTE>speak without book,</QUOTE> but honestly gives his authority; for he says that he <QUOTE>inquired of a carpenter named Webster, who 
<FIGURE id="Fig.132" n="2000.14.0049"><HEAD>St. James's Church, Bermondsey.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 was employed in making the  <Q>great wet dock at Rotherhithe</Q>  in the year <datestruct value="1694"><year reg="1694">1694</year></datestruct>, and who remembered that in the course of that work a considerable body of fagots and stakes were discovered,</QUOTE> which Maitland considers as <QUOTE>part of the works intended to strengthen the banks of the canal.</QUOTE> Allen adds, in his <QUOTE>History of London,</QUOTE> a remark to the effect that <QUOTE>it is allowed by many eminent antiquaries that there might have been such a water-course as Maitland describes from the wet dock at Deptford round by St. Thomas a Watering and Newington Butts, quite up to Vauxhall, and into the Thames at Chelsea Reach.</QUOTE> It has been suggested that the ditch here referred to may have been the same which we have mentioned above as passing by the end of Galley Wall; and that there may have been near this spot, in very remote times, a <QUOTE>wall</QUOTE> or landing-stage for the shipment of merchandise from the ancient <QUOTE>galleys.</QUOTE> The trade of the Venetians in the spices and other merchandise which they brought overland from India and sent to London in their <QUOTE>galleys</QUOTE> has passed away; and few are reminded by the name of <QUOTE>Galley Quay,</QUOTE> in Thames Street, that their proud argosies were once accustomed to ride at <pb id="P.133" n="133"> anchor there. It is just possible that there may have been a similar quay-or galley wall-at this spot for the use of the inhabitants of the south side of the Thames. 
   <P>It may be here remarked that in the early part of the present century there were pleasant walks about the Kent Road and Bermondsey where we should now look in vain for rural enjoyments. The favourite route from Southwark to the Old Kent Road was by way of the Halfpenny Hatch, the name of which is still retained, though the poplars and willows, and airy walks by the side of the small canals, are no more. <QUOTE>It is,</QUOTE> writes an enthusiastic cockney of our grandfathers' times, <QUOTE>a delightful spot, where the pensive mind may 
<FIGURE id="Fig.133" n="2000.14.0050"><HEAD>Rotherhithe Church, <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 in a summer evening indulge in an hour or <num value="2">two</num> of delightful musing and wholesome promenade.</QUOTE> The locality here referred to lies about midway between Long Lane and Kent Street, near the junction of Baalzephon and Hunter Streets. 
   <P>We may remark here, by way of a conclusion to this chapter, that Bermondsey and Rotherhithe are both well matched in point of filth, dirt, and unsavoury smells with their neighbour across the river--Wapping.   But squalid as is their general appearance, they abound in wealth, the fruits of industry and labour, no inconsiderable portion of it their own, while the remainder is stored up and warehoused within their boundaries for the convenience of their richer neighbours. <pb id="P.134" n="134">

<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.134.1">Landing Stairs</LEMMA></NOTE>
 
<P><LEMMA id="lemma.134.2">Rotherhithe</LEMMA>, or, as it is occasionally called, <QUOTE>Redriff,</QUOTE> is worthy of note as the <num value="1">first</num> place where docks were constructed for the convenience of London. The parish adjoins Bermondsey on the east, and extends along the southern shore of the Thames as far as Deptford. The compiler of the <QUOTE>New View of London,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, considers Rotherhithe as <QUOTE>equivalent to  <Q>Red Rose Haven,</Q>  probably from some such sign being there, as  <Q>Rother</Q>  Lane (now called Pudding Lane) had that name from   the sign of a red rose there.</QUOTE> Northouck, too, supports this view, telling us that the name of the place was formerly Red Rose Hithe, <QUOTE>from the sign of the Red Rose.</QUOTE> Maitland, however, with greater reason, supposes the name to be of Saxon origin, and that it was derived from the <num value="2">two</num> words, <hi rend=italics>redhra</hi>, a mariner, and <hi rend=italics>hyth,</hi>
a haven.   <hi rend=italics>Hitih</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>hythe</hi>, as is well known, is a common name for the lower port or haven of maritime towns, such as Colchester, Southampton, &amp;c. Rotherhithe, we may remark, was chiefly inhabited a <num value="100">hundred</num> years ago, as now, by seafaring persons and tradesmen whose business depended on seamen and shipping. The place is summarily dispatched in the <QUOTE>Ambulator</QUOTE> for <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, in the following terms :-- <QUOTE>Rotherhith (<foreign lang=la>sic</foreign>), vulgarly called Rederiff, was anciently a village on the south-east of London, though it is now joined on to Southwark, and as it is situated along the south bank of the Thames, is chiefly inhabited by masters of ships and other seafaring people.</QUOTE> It will be remembered that Gay, in the <hi rend=italics>Beggar's Opera,</hi>
makes mention of the place in the following lines:-- 
   <QUOTE REND=blockquote><sp><speaker>Filch.</speaker><p>These <num value="7">seven</num> handkerchiefs, madam. 
   </sp><sp><speaker>Mrs. Peachum.</speaker><p>Coloured ones, I see. They are of sure sale, from our warehouse at Redriff among the seamen.</QUOTE>
The place appears to have gone by the name of Redriff as long ago as the reign of Edward I. It is frequently mentioned by Pepys in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> and always by the appellation of Redriff. 
   <P>It was at Rotherhithe that King Knut is said to have begun his famous trench to Vauxhall, for the purpose of laying siege to London, as stated in a previous chapter.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, pp. <num value="4">4</num> and <num value="130">130</num>.</NOTE>  The channel through which the tide of the Thames was turned in the year when London Bridge was <num value="1">first</num> built of stone, is supposed by Stow and by several antiquaries tc have followed the same course, though many writers have dissented from this view. 
   <P>In a grant of the time of Edward III., by which Constance, then Prior of Bermondsey, assigned certain messuages to the king, the name is spelt <QUOTE>Rethereth.</QUOTE> At the time of the Domesday survey the place was included in the royal manor of Bermondsey; but Henry I. granted part of it to his natural son Robert, Earl of Gloucester. In the reign of Edward III. <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> manors into which Rotherhithe was divided belonged to the Abbey of St. Mary of Grace, on Tower Hill; but in the following year it was devised to the convent of St. Mary Magdalen, at Bermondsey, whose sisterhood already possessed that portion of the other manor which had not been given to the Earl of Gloucester. About the middle of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century the manor appears to have come into possession of the Lovel family. It was at this time a place of some note. In the reign of Edward III. a fleet had been fitted out there by order of the Black Prince and John of Gaunt.   Afterwards Henry IV. resided there in an old stone house, when afflicted with leprosy; he is said to have dated <num value="2">two</num> charters thence. The Lovel family highly distinguished themselves during the wars of the Roses, on the Lancastrian side. When Richard of Gloucester ascended the throne, Francis Lord Lovel was made Lord Chamberlain, and so great was hi influence with his royal master that he was joined with Catesby and Ratcliffe in the familiar couplet- 
          <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>The Cat, the Rat, and Lovel the tog 
             <L>Rule all England under a Hog;</QUOTE>
 <pb id="P.135" n="135"> Richard's emblem, the boar, being of course intended by the last-named animal.   Lovel fought well at Bosworth, and was fortunate enough to escape to   Burgundy after the defeat.   He   returned in the following year, and, in conjunction with Lord Stafford, raised forces in Worcestershire, which the king's troops, commanded by the Duke of Bedford, soon dispersed. Lovel re-appeared on the scene in <datestruct VALUE="1487-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1487">1487</year></datestruct>, with the Germans, under command of the Earl of Lincoln and Martin Swartz, who came over to support the claims of Lambert Simnel.   They were defeated at Stokeupon-Trent, and the Earl of Lincoln, with <num value="4000">4,000</num> of his men, was killed. Lovel escaped, but his fate is uncertain. Holinshed says he was slain, but many years afterwards a skeleton was discovered hidden away in the old manor-house of Minster Lovel, which, from the remains of the dress and other circumstances, was supposed to be that of the great Lord Lovel, who had hidden from pursuit, and was starved to death. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1516--"><year reg="1516">1516</year></datestruct>, Lovel being dead and gone, the Bermondsey monks claimed the manor of Rotherhithe, and gained it; but they did not long enjoy their possession, for in the year <datestruct value="1538"><year reg="1538">1538</year></datestruct> it was surrendered to the king, and remained royal property till  Charles I. granted it to Sir Allen Apsley. 
    <P>We hear and read but little of Rotherhithe during the next century or so. It is true that there is a dim and misty tradition of Charles II. on <num value="1">one</num> occasion having made a frolicsome excursion to this neighbourhood; but probably that was a very exceptional case, his Majesty's frolics being mostly restricted to the Court quarter of the town; or, if he crossed the river, it was mostly in the direction of Lambeth and Vauxhall.   Evelyn records in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date <datestruct VALUE="1699-06-11"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=11>11</day>, <year reg=1699>1699</year></datestruct>, a dreadful fire near the Thames side here, which destroyed nearly <num value="300">300</num> houses, and burnt also <QUOTE>divers ships.</QUOTE> On the ist of <datestruct VALUE="1765-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, another terrible fire, caused by a pitch-kettle boiling over, broke out in Princes Street, Rotherhithe, and before it could be extinguished more than <num value="200">200</num> houses, besides warehouses and other buildings, were entirely consumed, reducing at least <num value="250">250</num> families to the most terrible distress.   This conflagration was doubtless of some service in clearing the close mass of ill-built houses, and causing the erection of a better class of edifices. 
   <P>At the beginning of the present century Rotherhithe consisted of a few streets, with good gardens to the houses, extending from   the Blue Anchor Road (the boundary between Bermondsey   and Rotherhithe) to Hanover Street, beyond   which were marshes intersected by sluggish, dirty streams. The southern limit of the houses followed the line of Paradise Street and Adam Street, leading from Blue Anchor Road to the end of the Deptford Lower Road.   Blue Anchor Road (the river end of which was called West Lane) ran southwards, skirting the dirty streams and stagnant pools of Milford, to the end of Rogue's Lane, which ran through marshy fields to the <QUOTE>Halfway House,</QUOTE> past the <QUOTE>St. Helena</QUOTE> tavern and teagardens.   Near the <QUOTE>Halfway House</QUOTE> --which, by the way, was a neighbourhood noted as a resort of footpads-at the top of Trundley's Lane stood a few   houses, still existing, and named Mildmay Houses.   There were a few plots of market-garden ground here and there to be seen, near the spot now occupied by the Grand Surrey Docks, and adjoining Globe Stairs Alley, in the Blue Anchor Road; but the greater portion of the entire district between Rotherhithe and the Kent Road consisted of marshy fields. Mill Pond was the name given to a number of tidal ditchesnot unlike those of Jacob's Island--which intersected the space between Blue Anchor Road and the Deptford Lower Road. A larger stream discharged itself into the Thames at King's Mill; but that disappeared when the Grand Surrey Docks were constructed.   Within the last half century the inhabitants of the streets around Mill Pond were dependent upon these dirty tidal ditches for their supply of water, which was fetched in pails. Of late years, however, Mill Pond has been drained away, and rows of houses, some known as Jamaica Level, occupy the site. 
   <P>Few Londoners, at <num value="1">first</num> sight, would suspect Rotherhithe of having a soil or situation well suited to the growth of vines; but such would appear to have been once the case, if we may believe Hughson, who tells us, in his <QUOTE>History and Survey of London and its Suburbs,</QUOTE> that an attempt was made in <datestruct value="1725--"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>, in East Lane, within this parish, to restore the cultivation of the vine, which, whether from the inauspicious climate of our island, or from want of skill in the cultivation, was at that time nearly lost, though there are authentic documents to prove that vineyards<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="4">4</num>.</NOTE> did flourish in this country in ancient times. It appears that about the time indicated a gentleman named Warner, observing that the Burgundy grapes ripened early, and conceiving that they might be grown in England, obtained some cuttings, which he planted here as standards; and Hughson records the fact that though the soil was not particularly suited, yet, by care and skill, he was rewarded by success, and <pb id="P.136" n="136"> that his crop was so ample that it afforded him upwards of <num value="100">one hundred</num> gallons annually, and that he was enabled to supply cuttings of his vines for cultivation in many other parts of this island. 
    <P>At about the middle of that part of the Blue  Anchor Road which is now called Jamaica Level, are the gates and lodge-house of Southwark Park, which stretches away eastward to Rotherhithe New  Road, and northward to the Union Road and  Deptford Lower Road, in each of which thoroughfares there are entrances. The park, which covers about <num value="70">seventy</num> acres of ground, was laid out and opened in <datestruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct>, under the auspices of the Metropolitan Board of Works. It comprises a good open level piece of turf available for cricket-not, perhaps, to be compared with <QUOTE>Lord's</QUOTE> --and also several plots of ground laid out as ornamental flower-gardens, interspersed with shrubs and trees.  In <num value="1">one</num> part of the grounds, near the entrance from Jamaica Level, are <num value="2">two</num> mounds formed by the earth which was excavated from   under the bed of the river during the construction of the  Thames Tunnel. 
   <P>Before the formation of this park all the land hereabout consisted of fields and market-gardens, some considerable portion of which still exist in the neighbourhood of Rotherhithe and Deptford, in all their freshness.   We may remark here that the market-gardening--not only in these parts, but also in the districts near Battersea, Fulham, Hammersmith, and more remote parts--has attained a perfection which renders it a beautiful as well as interesting sight to examine the regularity and richness of the crops, the rapid system of clearing and fresh-cropping, and the mode of preparing and packing the produce for market. Perhaps in no <num value="1">one</num> department has English gardening arrived at more excellence, or is managed with more method and skill, than is to be witnessed in the marketgardens which supply the metropolis. 
   <P>In former times a narrow pathway, called the <QUOTE>Halfpenny Hatch,</QUOTE> extended through the meadows and market-gardens from Blue Anchor Road to the Deptford Lower Road, where it emerged close by an old and much-frequented public-house called the <QUOTE>China Hall.</QUOTE> The ancient tavern, which was a picturesque building partly surrounded by an external gallery, was pulled down within the last few years, and in its place has been erected a more modern-looking tavern, bearing the same sign.   Our old friend Pepys mentions going to China Hall, but gives us no further particulars. <QUOTE>It is not unlikely,</QUOTE> says Mr. Larwood in his <QUOTE>History of Sign-boards,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>that this was the same place which, in the summer of <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct>, was opened as a theatre. Whatever its use in former times, it was at that time the warehouse of a paper manufacturer.   In those days the West End often visited the entertainments of the East, and the new theatre was sufficiently patronised to enable the proprietors to venture upon some embellishments. The prices were-boxes, <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure>; pit, <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>s.</measure>; gallery Is.; and the time of commencing varied from half-past <num value="6">six</num> to <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock, according to the season.   <hi rend=italics>The Wonder, Love in a Village</hi>, the 
<hi rend=italics>Comical Courtship</hi>, and the <hi rend=italics>Lying   Valet</hi> were among the plays performed. The famous Cooke was <num value="1">one</num> of the actors in the season of <datestruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct>. In that same year the building suffered the usual fate of all theatres, and was utterly destroyed by fire.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The Halfpenny Hatch was continued beyond the <QUOTE>China Hall,</QUOTE> across the fields in the rear, to the <QUOTE>Dog and Duck</QUOTE> tavern, near the entrance to the Commercial Docks. Any <num value="1">one</num> patronising the <QUOTE>China Hall,</QUOTE> and partaking of refreshment, had the privilege of passing through the <QUOTE>Halfpenny Hatch</QUOTE> without payment of the halfpenny toll. 
    <P>With respect to the sign of the <QUOTE>Dog and  Duck,</QUOTE> we need hardly remark that it refers to a barbarous pastime of our ancestors, when ducks were hunted in a pond by spaniels.<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="352">352</num>.</NOTE> The pleasure consisted in seeing the duck make her escape from   the dog's mouth by diving. It was much practised in the neighbourhood of London, and particularly in these southern suburbs, till the beginning of this century, when it went out of fashion, as most of the ponds were gradually built over. 
   <P>The parish church of Rotherhithe is dedicated to <LEMMA id="lemma.136.1">St. Mary</LEMMA>, and stands not far from the river-side. It is built of brick, with stone quoins, and consists of a nave, chancel, and <num value="2">two</num> aisles, supported with pillars of the Ionic order. At the west end is a square tower, upon which is a stone spire, supported by Corinthian columns. The church was built in the early part of the last century, on the site of an older edifice, which had stood for <num value="400">four hundred</num> years, but which had at length become so ruinous that Parliament was applied to for permission to pull it down. The present church has lately been thoroughly <QUOTE>restored,</QUOTE> and the old unsightly pews of our grandfathers' time have been superseded by open benches.

  There are no monuments of any interest within the walls of the church, but in the vestry is preserved a portrait of Charles I. in his robes, kneeling at a table and holding a crown of thorns.  This portrait, if we may trust Aubrey's <QUOTE>Antiquities of Surrey,</QUOTE> formerly hung in the south aisle of the church. How it came into the possession of the parish is not stated. 
    <P>The church of Rotherhithe is in the diocese of  Rochester, having been transferred to it from that of Winchester. The advowson formerly belonged to the priory of Bermondsey, but after the suppression   of that monastery it passed through various hands. In <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct> it was sold to James,  Duke of Chandos, of whom it was purchased a few years later by the master and fellows of Clare  Hall, Cambridge.

   <P>The increase of population, partly owing to the opening of the extensive docks, was accompanied by an addition to the number of churches. In the year <datestruct value="1835"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct> the Commissioners for Building New Churches gave <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure> towards the erection of <num value="2">two</num> churches, and the trustees of Hyndman's Bounty, a local charity, offered to build a <num value="3">third</num>. 
   <P>Christ Church, in Union Road, opposite the gates on the north side of Southwark Park, is a plain and unpretending structure, of <QUOTE>debased Gothic</QUOTE> architecture, and dates its erection from about the year <datestruct value="1840"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>.

     <P>All Saints', in Deptford Lower Road, a Gothic edifice with a tower, surmounted by a lofty spire, was built from the designs of Mr. Kempthorne about the same time as the above, and at a cost of upwards of <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure>. Holy Trinity Church, in the eastern part of the parish, is a spacious edifice, in the Pointed style, capable of accommodating <num value="1000">1,000</num> persons. This church was consecrated in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>St. Barnabas' Church, a Gothic brick-built edifice, in Plough Road, near the Commercial Docks, was erected mainly through the instrumentality of Sir  William Gomm. It was built in <datestruct value="1872--"><year reg="1872">1872</year></datestruct>, from the designs of Mr. Butterfield.

    <P>A free school was founded in the parish of  Rotherhithe about the beginning of the last century, by Peter Hills and Robert Bell, and endowed with a small annual income <QUOTE>for the education of <num value="8">eight</num> sons of seamen, with a salary of <measure value="3l." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> pounds</measure> per annum   for the master.</QUOTE> The school-house, which is situated near St. Mary's  Church, was rebuilt by subscription in <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>.  Various benefactions have since been made to the school, so that the number of scholars has been considerably increased. 
    <P>A notice of Bermondsey and Rotherhithe would scarcely be complete without some reference to the educational movement which has of late years sprung up in these parishes, as, indeed, is the case with most other parishes in the metropolis. In the  Manor Road, Jamaica Level, Rotherhithe New  Road, and other parts, School-Board schools have been erected, which are altogether architectural adornments of the neighbourhood. Before the opening of the <QUOTE>board-schools,</QUOTE> it appears that there were in the Southwark district upwards of  <num value="42000">42,000</num> children for whom provision ought to have been made in elementary schools, but that the existing accommodation was wholly inadequate, only about <num value="13000">13,000</num> children having so much as their names inscribed on the rolls of the inspected schools. But since the erection of the schools above-mentioned large numbers of children have been added to the rolls, and attempts have been made to secure uniformity of fee within each of the schools. The policy of the regulation seems doubtful, since every neighbourhood contains a variety of classes among those depending upon the elementary schools for education, and the schools lie at considerable distances from   <num value="1">one</num> another. <pb id="P.138" n="138"> <QUOTE>In fixing the uniform fee,</QUOTE> as we learn from the report of Her Majesty's Inspector of Schools for this district, <QUOTE>if regard is paid to the best class of the neighbourhood, wrong is done to all with lower incomes who require   schooling; but if to the worst, the equitable interests of ratepayers are overlooked.

 Jonathan Swift, was born at Rotherhithe, or, as he styles it, <QUOTE>Redriff</QUOTE> --a fact of which Gulliver doubtless boasted to his courtly friends at Lilliput and Brobdingnag.   George Lillo, the dramatist, whose play of <hi rend=italics>George Barnwell</hi> was for many years the stock piece performed at our theatres before the pantomime on Boxing-night, is said to have kept a jeweller's shop at Rotherhithe. 
   <P>The St. Helena Tea-gardens, in Deptford Road, were opened in <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, and, after undergoing sundry vicissitudes, have   more than   completed   their centenary of existence.

In the summer there are brass bands and dancing platforms, singing, tumbling, and fireworks, for the delectation of the merry souls of <QUOTE>Redriff;</QUOTE> but the place has never attained more than a local celebrity, or affected to be a rival of Ranelagh or Vauxhall. 
   <P>A notice of Rotherhithe would be incomplete without at least some reference to that grand <pb id="P.139" n="139"> triumph of engineering skill, the Thames Tunnel, connecting Rotherhithe and Wapping, We have already spoken at some length of this great work ;<NOTE>See Vol. II., p. <num value="128">128</num>, <hi rend=italics>et seq.</hi></NOTE>
but, nevertheless, a few more words concerning it may not be out of place here. In <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct> a company was incorporated as the Thames Archway Company. A shaft was sunk at Rotherhithe, and a driftway pushed to within <num value="200">200</num> feet of the Limehouse shore. Then the water broke in, and the project was given up.   More than <num value="50">fifty</num> engineers of eminence declared it to be impracticable to construct a tunnel of any useful size beneath the bed of the Thames.   But as much was said afterwards against carrying a railroad across Chat Moss, and 
<FIGURE id="Fig.139" n="2000.14.0052"><HEAD>Floating Dock, Deptford (<datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 yet George Stephenson achieved that feat; and another great engineering genius, Isambard Brunel, happening, about the year <datestruct value="1814"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, to observe in the dockyard at Chatham   the little passages bored through timber by a marine insect, took from it a hint as to the construction of tunnels.   In course of time he matured the idea. In <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct> a company was formed, and Brunel set to work, and with his celebrated <QUOTE>shield,</QUOTE> an adaptation and imitation of the <QUOTE>teredo,</QUOTE> or marine worm, began the great tunnel. There were many mishaps. Twice the water broke in. Then came want of funds, and the work was suspended for <num value="7">seven</num> years. Public subscriptions raised <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure>, and once more Brunel set to work. On the <datestruct VALUE="1843-03-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>, the tunnel was opened as a public <pb id="P.140" n="140"> thoroughfare, and the successful engineer was knighted by Queen Victoria.   Of the diving-bell used in the construction of the Thames Tunnel we give an illustration on page <num value="138">138</num>. During the suspension of the work, great doubt was often expressed as to whether the tunnel would ever be completed. Tom   Hood wrote an <QUOTE>Ode to M. Brunel,</QUOTE> in which occur these lines:

   <P>We need   scarce add that for many years the geat work   was   numbered   with   the   splendid failures connected with the name of Brunel; and the tunnel, which had cost nearly half a million of money, became converted into little more than a penny show.   The roadway, which would have made it available for vehicular traffic, it is stated, would have required nearly <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure> more, and the money was not forthcoming.   As this kind of approach has now been formed, the tunnel may be said to have realised its original purpose, though not in the way designed by Sir M. I. Brunel.   In <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct> the tunnel was closed for pedestrians, and converted into a railway in connection with the East London   line.   This railway passes, by a gradual incline from the station of the Brighton and South-Coast line at New Cross, through the market gardens on the south   side of Deptford Lower Road.   Near the St. Helena Gardens there is a station for the convenience of this rapidlyincreasing district.   Thence, passing under the roadway, the line skirts the south-west side of the Commercial Docks, and then shortly afterwards finds its level at the mouth of the tunnel, where there is another station, between <num value="60">sixty</num> and <num value="70">seventy</num> feet below the surface of the ground. 
   <P>Rotherhithe has been for a considerable period celebrated for its docks. The great dry dock here ha<num value="4">4</num>sexisted for nearly <num value="2">two</num> centuries, having been opened in <datestruct value="1696--"><year reg="1696">1696</year></datestruct>; the great wet dock was finished in the year <datestruct value="1700"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct>. After the bursting of the South Sea Bubble in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, the directors took a lease of this dock, where their ships, then engaged in the whale-fisheries of Greenland, landed their cargoes of unfragrant blubber. The docks, known as the Commercial, are still used for the same purposes. Adjoining to them are the Great East Country Dock, and several smaller ones. From the situation of these very extensive docks, which include within their boundaries nearly a <num value="100">hundred</num> acres, of which about <num value="80">eighty</num> are water, they might doubtless be made, now that the trade of the port of London has so wonderfully increased, to rank among the most prosperous establishments of the metropolitan harbour. 
    <P>The Commercial Docks and Timber Ponds, and also the East Country Dock, are now incorporated with the Grand Surrey Canal Dock, the opening of which into the Thames is about <num value="2">two</num> miles below  London Bridge. In the Timber Ponds and East  Country Docks, timber, corn, hemp, flax, tallow, and other articles, which pay a small duty, and are of a bulky nature, remain in bond, and the surrounding warehouses are chiefly used as granaries, the timber remaining afloat in the dock until it is conveyed to the yards of the wholesale dealer and the builder. The Surrey Dock is merely an entrance basin to a canal, and can accommodate  <datestruct value="300"><year reg="300">300</year></datestruct> vessels; whilst the warehouses, chiefly granaries, will contain about <num value="4000">4,000</num> tons of goods. The  Commercial Docks, a little lower down the river, occupy an area of about <num value="49">forty-nine</num> acres, of which <num value="4">four</num>-fifths are water, and there is accommodation for <num value="350">350</num> ships, and in the warehouses for <num value="50000">50,000</num> tons of merchandise. They were used originally, as stated above, for the shipping employed in the  Greenland fishery, and provided with the necessary apparatus for boiling down the blubber of whales; but the whale fishery being given up, the docks were, about the year <datestruct value="1807"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, appropriated to vessels engaged in the European timber and corn trade, and ranges of granaries were built. The East  Country Dock, which adjoins the Commercial  Docks on the south, is capable of receiving twentyeight timber ships, and was constructed about the same period for like purposes. It has an area of about <num value="6">six</num> acres and a half, and warehouse-room for nearly <num value="4000">4,000</num> tons. 
   <P>The various docks and basins embraced in the elaborate system belonging to the Surrey Commercial Dock Company are no less than <num value="13">thirteen</num> in number, and are named respectively the Main Dock, the Stave Dock, the Russia Dock, Quebec Pond, Canada Pond, Albion Pond, Centre Pond, <pb id="P.141" n="141"> Lady Dock, Acorn Pond, Island Dock, Norway Dock, Greenland Dock, and South Dock. 
    <P>In all that concerns the bustle of trade and industry, no capital in the world can compare with  London.   Foreign travellers, like the Viscount  D&lsquo;Arlingcourt, own that the Neva is in this respect as far below the Thames as it is above it in splendid buildings and scenery. <QUOTE>What can be more wonderful,</QUOTE> he asks, <QUOTE>than its docks? Those vast basins, in the midst of which are barracked whole legions of vessels, which the sovereign of maritime cities receives daily? These vessels enter thither from the Thames by a small canal, which opens for their admittance and closes after them.  The docks are surrounded by immense warehouses, where all the products of the universe are collected together, and where each ship unloads its wealth.  It would be impossible, without seeing it, to fancy the picture presented by these little separate harbours in the midst of an enormous city, where an innumerable population of sailors, shopkeepers, and   artisans   are incessantly and   tumultuously hurrying to and fro.</QUOTE> 
    <P> <QUOTE>In <datestruct value="1558--"><year reg="1558">1558</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Charles Knight in his <QUOTE>London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>certain wharfs, afterwards. known as the <Q>Legal Quays,</Q> were appointed to be the sole landing-places for goods in   the port of  London. They were situated between Billingsgate and the Tower, and had a frontage of <num value="1464">1,464</num> feet by <num value="40">40</num> wide, and of this space <num value="300">300</num> feet were taken up by landing-stairs and by the coasting-trade, leaving, in the year <datestruct value="1796"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>, only <num value="1164">1,164</num> for the use of the foreign trade. Other wharfs had, it is true, been added from   time to time, <num value="5">five</num> of these   <Q>sufferance wharfs,</Q>  as they were called, being on the northern side of the river, and <num value="16">sixteen</num> on the opposite side, comprising altogether a frontage of  <num value="3676">3,676</num> feet.   The warehouses belonging to the 
 <Q>sufferance wharfs</Q> were capable of containing  <num value="125000">125,000</num> tons of merchandise, and <num value="78800">78,800</num> tons could be stowed in the yards. The want of warehouse room was so great that sugars were deposited in warehouses on Snow Hill, and even in Oxford  Street.   Wine, spirits, and the great majority of articles of foreign produce, especially those on which the higher rates of duties were charged, could be landed only at the Legal Quays. In <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct> sugars were allowed to be landed at the sufferance wharfs, but the charges were higher than at the Legal Quays; extra fees had to be paid to the revenue officers for attendance at them, though at the same time they were inconveniently situated, and at too great a distance from   the centre of business.   The above concession to the sufferance wharfs was demanded by common sense and necessity, for the ships entered with sugar increased from   <num value="203">203</num> in <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>, to <num value="433">433</num>, of larger dimensions, in <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>. Generally speaking, the sufferance wharfs were used chiefly by vessels in the coasting trade, and for such departments of the foreign trade as could not by any possibility be accommodated at the Legal Quays. Even in <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct> commissions appointed by the Court of Exchequer had reported that the latter were  <Q>not of sufficient extent, from which delays and many extraordinary expenses occur, and obstructions to the due collection of the revenue.</Q>  But the commerce of London had wonderfully increased since that time, its progress in the <num value="25">twenty-five</num> years, from <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct> having been as great as in the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="70">seventy</num> years of the century.</QUOTE> Among the various plans for docks, quays, and warehouses, which were drawn up at the end of the last century, with the view of remedying the evils spoken of above, was <num value="1">one</num> which displayed considerable ingenuity, and consisted, in fact, of <num value="4">four</num> distinct projects: -<num value="1">1</num>. To form a new channel for the river in a straight line from Limehouse to Blackwall; the Long Reach round the Isle of Dogs thus constituting a dock with flood-gates at each entrance. <num value="2">2</num>. To continue the new channel below Blackwall towards Woolwich Reach, so as to convert another bend of the old channel into a dock. <num value="3">3</num>. To make a new channel from Wapping, and to form <num value="3">three</num> docks out of the <num value="3">three</num> bends, to be called Ratcliffe Dock, Blackwall Dock, and Greenwich Dock. The Trinity House objected that the King's Dock at Deptford would be injured by the latter plan, on which it was proposed-<num value="4">4</num>. To make a new channel from Wapping to the old channel between Greenland Dock (now the Commercial Docks) and Deptford, thence inclining to the northward until it opened into Woolwich Reach, thus forming <num value="2">two</num> spacious docks out of the bends of the river (above and below) at Blackwall. 
    <P>The Commercial Docks have an entrance from the Thames, between Randall's Rents and Dogand-Duck Stairs, nearly opposite the King's Arms  Stairs in the Isle of Dogs. They are the property of the Surrey Commercial Dock Company. A considerable extension of their area has been made within the last few years, with a view to meeting the increased requirements of the timber trade in the port of London, by the addition of a new dock which has been named the Canada Dock.  It is <num value="1500">1,500</num> feet in length, <num value="500">500</num> feet in width, and has a water area of <num value="16">sixteen</num> acres and a half. It communicates with the Albion Dock by an entrance <num value="50">fifty</num> feet in width, and the quay space around is upwards of <num value="21">twenty-one</num> acres in extent. <pb id="P.142" n="142"> 
    <P>On the river-side of the Commercial Docks, just below Rotherhithe Church, at the bend in the river forming the commencement of Limehouse Reach, is <QUOTE>Cuckold's Point,</QUOTE> which was formerly distinguished by a tall pole with a pair of horns on the top, and concerning which a singular story is told. From this point of the river, lying away to the right above Greenwich, is seen the village of  Charlton, with which the tradition is connected.  The manor-house there, of which we shall have more to say presently, although built only in the reign of James I., was long called King John's  Palace by the country people, who doubtless confounded it with the old palace at Eltham in the vicinity, which, however, was not itself in existence in King John's day. <QUOTE>The Charlton people, however,</QUOTE> writes Dr. Mackay in his <QUOTE>Thames and its  Tributaries,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>cling to King John, and insist that their celebrated Horn Fair, held annually on the  <datestruct VALUE="-10-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, was established by that monarch.  Lysons, in his  <Q> Environs of London,</Q>  mentions it as a vague and idle tradition; and such, perhaps, it is; but, as we are of opinion that the traditions of the people are always worth preserving, we will repeat the legend, and let the reader value it at its proper worth. King John, says the old story, being wearied with hunting on Shooter's Hill and  Blackheath, entered the house of a miller at  Charlton to repose himself. He found no <num value="1">one</num> at home but the mistress, who was young and beautiful; and being himself a strapping fellow, handsome withal, and with a glosing tongue, he, in a very short time-or as we would say in the present day, in no time-made an impression upon her too susceptible heart. He had just ventured to give the <num value="1">first</num> kiss upon her lips when the miller opportunely came home and caught them.  Being a violent man, and feeling himself wounded in the sorest part, he drew his dagger, and rushing at the king, swore he would kill them both. The poet of all time hath said,  <Q>that a divinity doth hedge a king;</Q>  but the miller of Charlton thought such proceedings anything but divine, and would no doubt have sent him unannealed into the other world if John had not disclosed his rank. His divinity then became apparent, and the miller, putting up his weapon, begged that at least he would make him some amends for the wrong he had done him. The king consented, upon condition also that he would forgive his wife, and bestowed upon him all the land visible from Charlton to that bend of the river beyond Rotherhithe where the pair of horns are now (<datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>) fixed upon the pole. He also gave him, as lord of the manor, the privilege of an annual fair on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, the day when this occurrence took place. His envious compeers, unwilling that the fame of this event should die, gave the awkward name of Cuckold's Point to the   river boundary   of his property, and called the fair  <Q>Horn Fair,</Q>  which it has borne ever since.</QUOTE> Peter Cunningham, in his <QUOTE>Handbook of London,</QUOTE> thus gives his version of the story :-- <QUOTE>King John, wearied with hunting on Shooter's Hill and Blackheath, entered the house of a miller at Charlton to refresh and rest himself. He found no <num value="1">one</num> at home but the miller's wife, young, it is said, and beautiful. The miller, it so happened, was earlier in coming home than was usual when he went to Greenwich with his meal; and red and raging at what he saw   on his return, he drew   his knife.   The king being unarmed, thought it prudent to   make himself known, and the miller, only too happy to think it was no baser individual, asked a boon of the king.   The king consented, and the miller was told to clear his eyes, and claim the long strip of land he could see before him on the Charlton side of the river Thames. The miller cleared his eyes, and saw as far as the point near Rotherhithe. The king then admitted the distance, and the miller was put into possession of the property on <num value="1">one</num> condition--that he should walk annually on that day, the <datestruct VALUE="-10-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, to the farthest bounds of the estate with a pair of buck's horns upon his head.</QUOTE> Of this tradition our readers may believe as much, or as little, as they please. <QUOTE>Horn Fair,</QUOTE> adds Mr. Cunningham, <QUOTE>is still kept every <datestruct VALUE="-10-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, at the pretty little village of Charlton, in Kent; and the watermen on   the Thames at Cuckold's Point still tell the story (with many variations and additions) of the jolly miller and his light and lovely wife.</QUOTE> The horns, we need scarcely add, have long disappeared from Cuckold's Point, and the disreputable fair formerly held at Charlton has, fortunately, now become a thing of the past. 
   <P>Taylor, the <QUOTE>water-poet,</QUOTE> makes mention of the above tradition in the following lines : 
   <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>And passing further, I at <num value="1">first</num> observed 
     <L>That Cuckold's Haven was but badly served:

     <L>No monumental memorable Horn,

<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.143.2">Deptford from Land</LEMMA></NOTE>
 
<P>The town of Deptford-anciently written Depeford--which lies on the east side of Rotherhithe, and stretches away to Lewisham on the south, and to Greenwich on the east, was, at a very remote period, known as West Greenwich. It derived its present name from being the place of a <QUOTE>deep ford</QUOTE> over the little river, the Ravensbourne, near its influx into the Thames, where a bridge was many years ago built over it, just before it widens into Deptford Creek. 
   <P>It is described in the <QUOTE>Ambulator,</QUOTE> in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, as <QUOTE>a large and populous town, divided into Upper and Lower Deptford, and containing <num value="2">two</num> churches.</QUOTE> The place was of old famous for its naval shipbuilding yard, a fact which is thus noticed in the work above quoted: <QUOTE>Deptford is most remarkable for its noble dock, where the royal navy was formerly built and repaired, till it was found more convenient to build the larger ships at Woolwich, and at other places, where there is a greater depth of water.</QUOTE> Notwithstanding   this, the yard is enlarged to more than double its former dimensions, and a vast number of hands are constantly employed. It has a wet dock of <num value="2">two</num> acres for ships, and another with an acre and a half, with vast quantities of timber and other stores, and extensive buildings as storehouses and offices for the use of the place, besides dwelling-houses for the use of those officers who are obliged to live upon the spot in order to superintend the works. Here the royal yachts of our Tudor and Stuart sovereigns were generally kept. 
   <P>By an Act of Parliament passed in <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, Deptford was divided into <num value="2">two</num> parishes, distinguished by the names of St. Nicholas and St. Paul. The parish of St. Nicholas, which includes the old town, lies mainly along the river Thames, and the combined parishes have now a population of about <num value="60000">60,000</num> souls. 
   <P>According to the author of <QUOTE>Le Guide de l&lsquo;Etranger a Londres,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, it is the last <hi rend=italics>relais</hi> of the traveller by the posting road from Dover to London. He states that it is divided into an upper and lower town, and draws attention to its <num value="2">two</num> churches of St. Nicholas and St. Paul, and to its Royal Marine Arsenal, the creation of Henry VIII., where cables, masts, anchors, &amp;c., are manufactured, and the royal state yachts are kept. He mentions also the Red House to the north of Deptford, the <QUOTE>grand depot of provisions for the fleet,</QUOTE> burnt down in <datestruct value="1639--"><year reg="1639">1639</year></datestruct>, and again in <datestruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>. The town at that time numbered <num value="17000">17,000</num> inhabitants. 
   <P>The change of the name of this place from West Greenwich to that which it now bears, and has borne for some hundreds of years, must, as we have intimated above, have been owing to the <QUOTE>deep ford</QUOTE> by which the inhabitants had to cross the river Ravensbourne here, just above its meeting with the Thames. The ford, however, has long since been superseded by a bridge. This bridge, according to Charles Mackay, in his <QUOTE>Thames and its Tributaries,</QUOTE> is memorable in history for the total defeat of Lord Audley and his Cornish rebels in the year <datestruct value="1497"><year reg="1497">1497</year></datestruct>. Headed by that nobleman and by a lawyer named Flammock, and Joseph, a blacksmith of Bodmin, they had advanced from Taunton with the design of taking possession of London. The Kentish men flocked to their standard, and on their arrival at Blackheath they amounted altogether to about <num value="16000">16,000</num> men. Lord Daubeny, who had been sent against them by King Henry VII., made a furious attack upon them   at Deptford Bridge, and after great slaughter put them to flight. <LEMMA id="lemma.143.3">Lord Audley</LEMMA>, Flammock, and Joseph were all taken prisoners, and shortly afterwards were executed on Tower Hill, the latter boasting in his hour of death that he died in a just cause, and that he would make a figure in history. Such are the vain and foolish hopes with which low-bred rebels and impostors, from his day to that of the Orton and Tichborne trial, have too often buoyed themselves up. 
   <P>The little stream of the Ravensbourne, which is here called Deptford Creek, rises upon Keston Heath, near Hayes Common, in Kent, and runs <pb id="P.144" n="144"> a course of about <num value="12">twelve</num> miles in all, passing Bromley and Lewisham and the southern borders of Blackheath. It was formerly sometimes called the Brome, from Bromley. An old legend is told to account for its romantic name:--<QUOTE rend=blockquote>It is said that Julius Caesar, on his invasion of Britain, was encamped with all his force a few miles distant from its source. The army was suffering a good deal from   want of water, and detachments had been sent out in all directions to find a supply, but without any success.   Caesar, however, fortunately observed that a raven frequently alighted near the camp, and conjecturing that it came to drink, he ordered its arrival to be carefully noted. This command was obeyed, and the visits of the raven were found to be to a small clear spring on Keston Heath. The wants of the army were supplied, and the spring, says the legend, and the rivulet of which it is the parent, have ever since been called the <Q>Raven's Well</Q> and the <Q>Ravensbourne.</Q></QUOTE>
This legend, however, it is to be feared, is more pretty than true. For even if the facts occurred as stated, it is scarcely likely that the Roman legions would have communicated them to the wild and savage tribes whom they were so bent on subduing to the iron rule of Imperial Rome; and if they did teach the Britons so pretty a story, they would not have been likely to use the British or the Saxon tongue in communicating it to them. We may, therefore, safely dismiss it as a mere fable, invented by some poetically-minded individual, in order to 
<FIGURE id="Fig.144" n="2000.14.0053"><HEAD>The Royal Dock, Deptford; End Of Seventeenth Century.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 account for the name which he found already established   by   immemorial custom.      In   some legends we can trace an element of truth; but in this we fail to discover even <QUOTE>the shadow   of a shade</QUOTE> of anything except romance. 
   <P>The Ravensbourne, it may be here stated, is still, as it is described by some poet quoted in Hone's <QUOTE>Table Book,</QUOTE> 
   <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>A crystal rillet, scarce a palm in width, 
     <L>Till creeping to a bed, outspread by art, 
     <L>It shoots itself across, reposing there; 
     <L>Thence through a thicket sinuous it flows, 
     <L>And crossing meads and footpaths, gathering tribute 
     <L>Due to its elder birth from younger branches, 
     <L>Wanders, by Hayes and Bromley, Beckenham Vale,. 
     <L>And straggling Lewisham, to where Deptford Bridge. 
     <L>Uprises in obeisance to its flood.</QUOTE>
 
   <P>But small and insignificant as the stream may now   appear, the Ravensbourne is a river which has a name in history. We have recorded above how it witnessed the rout and capture of Lord Audley's rebel forces; but this is not all. <QUOTE>More than <num value="1">one</num> tumultuous multitude,</QUOTE> writes Charles Mackay, <QUOTE>has encamped upon its banks, shouting loud defiance to their lawful rulers. Blackheath, its near neighbour, was overrun by Wat Tyler and the angry thousands that followed in   his train; and in the Ravensbourne, perchance, many of those worthy artisans stooped down to drink its then limpid waters, when, inflamed by revenge and by the hope of plunder and of absolute power, <pb id="P.145" n="145"> they prepared to march upon London. Jack Cade and his multitudes in their turn encamped about the self-same spot; and the Ravensbourne, after an interval of <num value="80">eighty</num> years, saw its quiet shores disturbed by men who met there for the same purposes, and threatening bloodshed against the peaceful citizens of London, because, feeling the scourge of oppression, they knew no wiser means of obtaining relief, and were unable to distinguish between law and tyranny on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and freedom and licentiousness on the other.</QUOTE> The same author reminds us that as Perkin Warbeck met his adherents near about the same spot, the same scene must have occurred here again during the reign of Henry VII. It may not be out of place to record here the fact that at Hayes, not far from the sources of the Ravensbourne, was the favourite seat of the great Lord Chatham, whose illustrious son, William Pitt, the <QUOTE>heaven-born</QUOTE> minister of 
<FIGURE id="Fig.145" n="2000.14.0054"><HEAD>Samuel Pepys.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 King George III., was born there on the <datestruct VALUE="1759-05-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1759">1759</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>There are, and have been for many centuries, corn and other mills situated on the Ravensbourne in its picturesque windings through Deptford and Brockley, and so on to its source. To <num value="1">one</num> of these John Evelyn refers in his <QUOTE>Dairy,</QUOTE> where, under date of <datestruct VALUE="1668-04-28"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1668>1668</year></datestruct>, he writes: <QUOTE>To London, about the purchase of the Ravensbourne Mills and land round it <hi rend=italics>(sic</hi>) in Upper Deptford.</QUOTE> 
   <P>As shown in the line quoted as a motto at the head of this chapter, Deptford is styled by Pope, in his well-known lines on the Thames, a <QUOTE>navy-building town,</QUOTE> and right well in former years did it deserve its name; for the Trinity House here, and also the docks and the once extensive yards for ship-building, all date from the reign of Henry VIII., and were here established by that sovereign, to whom belongs, at all events, <pb id="P.146" n="146"> the credit of having been the founder of the British navy. 
    <P>It is a matter of history that Deptford, notwithstanding its contiguity to the main road through Kent, and its nearness to the metropolis, continued little more than a mean fishing village till Henry VIII. <num value="1">first</num> erected a store and made the royal dock there, from which time the town has continued to increase both in size and population. 
   <P>The Royal Dock, or <QUOTE>King's Yard,</QUOTE> as it was locally called in former times, was esteemed <num value="1">one</num> of the most complete repositories for naval stores in Europe. It covered not less than <num value="30">thirty</num> acres of ground, and contained every convenience for building, repairing, and fitting out shipsof-the- line-those veritable <QUOTE>wooden walls of Old England</QUOTE> with which we were familiar before the introduction of armour-plated vessels. Artificers in wood and in iron had here large ranges of workshops and storehouses; and here the hammer and the axe were scarcely ever idle, even in times of peace; but where, during the prevalence of war, they were plied incessantly <QUOTE>in the construction of those floating bulwarks for which England is, or rather was, renowned, and which carry a <num value="120">hundred and twenty</num> guns and a <num value="1000">thousand</num> men to guard her shores from the invader, or to bear her fame with her victories to the remotest seas of the ocean.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The yard was occupied by various buildings, such as <num value="2">two</num> wet docks (<num value="1">one</num> double and the other single), <num value="3">three</num> <QUOTE>slips</QUOTE> for men-of-war, a basin, <num value="2">two</num> mast ponds, a model loft, mast houses, a large smith's shop, together with numerous forges for anchors, sheds for timber, &amp;c., besides houses for the officers who superintended the works.   The finest machinery in the world is said to have been employed in Deptford Dockyard for spinning hemp and manufacturing ropes and cables for the service of the navy. The large storehouse on the north side of the quadrangle was erected in the year <datestruct value="1513"><year reg="1513">1513</year></datestruct>. This may be said to have been the commencement of the works at Deptford, which under successive sovereigns gradually grew up and extended. 
   <P>The old storehouse, which was a quadrangular pile, appears to have consisted originally only of a range on the north side, where, on what was formerly the front of the building, is the date <datestruct value="1513"><year reg="1513">1513</year></datestruct>, together with the initials H R in a cipher, and the letters AX for Anno Christi. The buildings on the east, west, and south sides of the quadrangle were erected at different times; and a double front, towards the north, was added in <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>. Another storehouse, parallel to the above, and of the same length, having sail and rigging lofts, was completed towards the close of the last century; and a long range of smaller storehouses was built under the direction of Sir Charles Middleton, afterwards Lord Barham, about the year <datestruct value="1780"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>In Charnock's <QUOTE>History of Marine Architecture</QUOTE> is given <QUOTE>A   note how many ships the King's  Majesty (Henry VIII.) hath in harbour, on the r<num value="8">8</num>th day of September, in the <num value="13">13th</num> year of his reign (<datestruct value="1521--"><year reg="1521">1521</year></datestruct>); what portage they be of; what estate they be in the same day; also where they ride and be bestowed.</QUOTE> From this we are enabled to see what use was made of Deptford as a naval station at that time:-- <QUOTE>The <hi rend=italics>Mary Rose</hi>, being of the portage of <num value="600">600</num> tons, lying in the pond at  Deptford beside the storehouse there, &amp;c.

    <P>Deptford dockyard, in its time, received many royal and distinguished visitors; the earliest of whom   we have any record was Edward VI., who thus tells us of the provision made for his reception:-- <QUOTE><datestruct VALUE="1549-06-19"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=19>19th</day>, <year reg=1549>1549</year></datestruct>.

Her Majesty dined on board, and after dinner conferred the honour of knighthood on the captain.   A   prodigious concourse of people assembled on the occasion,. and a wooden bridge, on which were a <num value="100">hundred</num> persons, broke down, but no lives were lost. Sir Francis Drake's ship, when it became unfit for service, was laid up in this yard, where it remained many years, the cabin being, as it seems, turned into a banqueting-house:  <Q>We'll have our supper,</Q>  says Sir Petronel Flash, in a comedy called <hi rend=italics>Eastward-hoe</hi>, written by Ben Jonson and others,  <Q>on board Sir Francis Drake's ship, that hath compassed the world!</Q>  It was at length broken up, and a chair made out of it for John Davis, Esq., who presented it to the University of Oxford.</QUOTE> It is recorded that Queen Elizabeth not only partook of a collation on board Drake's ship, and afterwards knighted him, but that she also consented to share the golden fruits of his succeeding adventures.   Miss Strickland observes, with reference to this record, that <QUOTE>as some of Drake's enterprises were of a decidedly piratical character, and attended with circumstances of plunder and cruelty to the infant colonies of Spain, the policy of Elizabeth, in sanctioning his deeds, is doubtful.</QUOTE> She gave orders that his ship, the <hi rend=italics>Golden Hind</hi>, should be preserved here as a memorial of the national glory and of her great captain's enterprise. For long years, accordingly, in obedience to her royal command, the vessel was kept in Deptford dockyard until it fell into decay, when all that remained sound of her was converted into a chair, which was presented to the University of Oxford, and is still kept in the Bodleian library. The chair was thus characteristically apostrophised by Cowley:--

   <P>As might be expected, Deptford dockyard is frequently mentioned in the diaries of Evelyn and Pepys; by the former on account of its nearness to Saye's Court, and by the latter on account of his official connection with the navy. 
   <P>It was in <datestruct value="1651--"><year reg="1651">1651</year></datestruct> that Evelyn <num value="1">first</num> settled in Deptford, as we find from the following entry in his <QUOTE>Diary:</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>I went to Deptford, where I made preparation for my settlement, either in this or some other place, there being now so little appearance of any change for the better, all being entirely in the Rebells' hands, and this particular habitation and the estate contiguous to it (belonging to my fatherin-law) very much suffering for want of some friend to rescue it out of the power of the usurpers; so as to preserve our interest I was advis'd to reside in it, and compound with the souldiers. I had also addresses and cyfers to correspond with his majesty and ministers abroad: upon all which I was persuaded to settle in England, having now run about the world neere <num value="10">ten</num> yeares. I likewise meditated sending over for my wife from Paris.</QUOTE> A   few   days later Evelyn thus writes: <QUOTE>I saw the <hi rend=italics>;Diamond</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Ruby</hi> launch'd in the dock at Deptford, carrying <num value="48">forty-eight</num> brasse cannon each.

   <P>Experiments would appear to have been made from time to time; at all events, here is the record of <num value="1">one</num> of which Evelyn was an eye-witness.

We fell to choosing <num value="4">four</num> captains to command the guards, and choosing the place where to keep them, and other things in order thereunto. Never till now did I see the great authority of my place, all the captains of the fleete coming cap in hand to us.</QUOTE> On the next day, the <num value="13">13th</num>, he writes: <QUOTE>After sermon <pb id="P.148" n="148"> to Deptford again; where, at the Commissioner's and the  <Q>Globe,</Q>  we staid long. But no sooner in bed, but we had an alarme, and so we rose; and the Comptroller comes into the yard to us; and seamen of all the ships present repair to us, and there we armed every <num value="1">one</num> with a handspike, with which they were as fierce as could be. At last we hear that it was <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> men that did ride through the guard in the towne, without stopping to the guard that was there: and, some say, shot at them. But all being quiet there, we caused the seamen to go on board again.</QUOTE> 
    <P>On <datestruct VALUE="1660-01-15"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=15>15</day>, <year reg=1660>1660</year></datestruct>-<num value="1">1</num>, he makes this entry: <QUOTE>The King [Charles II.] hath been this afternoon to Deptford, to see the yacht that Commissioner  Pett is building, which will be very pretty; as also that his brother at Woolwich is making.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Pepys, in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> <datestruct VALUE="1662-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, mentions a certain project of Sir Nicholas Crisp to make a great <QUOTE>sasse,</QUOTE> or sluice, in <QUOTE>the king's lands about Deptford,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>to be a wett-dock to hold <num value="200">200</num> sail of ships.</QUOTE> This project is also mentioned by Evelyn and by Lysons. 
   <P>Pepys writes under date <datestruct VALUE="1667-04-28"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1667>1667</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>To Deptford, and there I walked down the yard, .   . . and discovered about clearing of the wet docke, and heard (which I had before) how, when the docke was made, a ship of nearly <num value="500">500</num> tons was there found; a ship supposed of Queen Elizabeth's time, and well wrought, with a great deal of stoneshot in her, of eighteen inches diameter, which was shot then in use; and afterwards meeting with Captain Perryman and Mr. Castle at Half-way Tree, they tell me of stone-shot of <num value="36">thirty-six</num> inches in diameter, which they shot out of mortar pieces.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Again, in the following May:-- <QUOTE>By water to Deptford, it being Trinity Monday, when the Master is chosen.   And so I down with them; and we had a good dinner of plain meat, and good company at our table; among others my good Mr. Evelyn, with whom, after dinner, I stepped aside and talked upon the present posture of our affairs.</QUOTE> Again, when in <datestruct VALUE="1667-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>, the alarm was raised that the Dutch fleet was already off the Nore and in the Medway, Samuel Pepys relates another official visit: <QUOTE>So we all down to Deptford, and pitched upon ships, and set men at work; but Lord! to see how backwardly things move at this pinch.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In this same year, as we are told by John Evelyn, a large fire, breaking out in Deptford dockyard, <QUOTE>made such a blaze and caused such an uproar in London, that everybody believed the Dutch fleet had sailed up the river and fired the Tower.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Here were launched many of the <QUOTE>wooden walls of old England,</QUOTE> especially during the reigns of the later Stuarts. For example, Evelyn tells us that he stood near the king here in <datestruct VALUE="1668-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>, at the launch of <QUOTE>that goodly vessel, <hi rend=italics>The Charles</hi>.</QUOTE> Pepys, too, was here on this occasion, for under date of <datestruct VALUE="1668-03-3"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=3>3</day>, <year reg=1668>1668</year></datestruct>, he writes:-- <QUOTE>Down by water to Deptford; where the King, Queene, and Court are to see launched the new ship built by Mr. Shish, called <hi rend=italics>The Charles</hi>. God send her better luck than the former!</QUOTE> 
    <P>Evelyn tells us that many of the dockyard 
<hi rend=italics>employes</hi> rose to independence, and even affluence. Among others he mentions the funeral here of the above-mentioned old Mr. Shish, master shipwright, whose death he styles a public loss, for his excellent success in building ships, though altogether illiterate. <QUOTE>I held the pall,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE>with <num value="3">three</num> knights, who did him that honour, and he was worthy of it .... It was the custom of this good man to rise in the night, and to pray kneeling in his own coffin, which he had by him   many years.</QUOTE> 
   <P>At the close of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century Peter the Great visited the dockyard for the purpose of studying naval architecture, residing during his stay at Evelyn's house, Saye's Court, where we shall again meet with him presently. In the dockyard, it is on record that he did the work of an ordinary shipwright, and that he also paid close attention to the principles of ship-designing. His evenings were mostly spent in a public-house in smoking and drinking with his attendants and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> chosen companions. 
   <P>It may be worthy of a note that in the <QUOTE>Life of 
<LEMMA id="lemma.148.1">Captain Cook</LEMMA></QUOTE> we are told that the <num value="2">two</num> ships, the 
<hi rend=italics>Resolution</hi> and the <hi rend=italics>Discovery</hi>, in which he made his last voyage to the Pacific, lay here whilst being equipped by the shipwrights for their distant voyage.   The <hi rend=italics>Queen Charlotte</hi> (<num value="120">120</num> guns) was launched from this yard in <datestruct VALUE="1810-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>Samuel Pepys, the author of the <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> from which we have culled so many interesting pieces of intelligence during the progress of this work, and whose portrait we present to our readers on page <num value="145">145</num>, was descended from a family originally seated at Diss, in Norfolk, and who settled at Cottingham, in Cambridgeshire, early in the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century. His father, John Pepys, at <num value="1">one</num> time followed the trade of a tailor; he had a numerous family. Samuel Pepys was born in <datestruct value="1632--"><year reg="1632">1632</year></datestruct>, and was educated at St. Paul's School,<NOTE>See Vol. I., p. <num value="274">274</num>.</NOTE> London, and afterwards at the University of Cambridge. At the age of about <pb id="P.149" n="149"> <num value="23">twenty-three</num> he took to himself a wife in the person of <num value="1">one</num> Elizabeth St. Michael, then a beautiful girl <num value="15">fifteen</num> years old. At this time, Pepys' relation, Sir Edward Montagu, afterwards <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Sandwich, proved his friend, and prevented the ill consequences which such an early marriage might have entailed upon him. Sir Edward took young Pepys with him on his expedition to the Sound, in <datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>, and upon his return obtained for him a clerkship in the Exchequer. Through the interest of Lord Sandwich, Pepys was nominated <QUOTE>Clerk of the Acts,</QUOTE> and this was the commencement of his connection with a great national establishment, to which in the sequel his diligence and acuteness were of the highest service. <QUOTE>From   his papers, still extant,</QUOTE> writes Lord Braybrooke, <QUOTE>we gather that he never lost sight of the public good; that he spared no pains to check the rapacity of contractors, by whom   the naval stores were then supplied; that he studied order and economy in the dockyards, advocated the promotion of the oldestablished officers in the navy; and resisted to the utmost the infamous system of selling places then most unblushingly practised.   . . . He continued in this office till <datestruct value="1673"><year reg="1673">1673</year></datestruct>; and during those great events, the plague, the fire of London, and the Dutch war, the care of the navy in a great measure rested upon Pepys alone.</QUOTE> He afterwards rose to be Secretary of the Admiralty, an office which he retained till the Revolution. On the accession of William   and Mary he retired into private life.   He sat in Parliament for Castle Rising, and subsequently represented the borough of Harwich, eventually rising to wealth and eminence as Clerk of the Treasurer to the Commissioners of the affairs of Tangier, and Surveyor- General of the Victualling Department, <QUOTE>proving himself to be,</QUOTE> it is stated, <QUOTE>a very useful and energetic public servant.</QUOTE> He suffered imprisonment for a short time in <datestruct value="1679--"><year reg="1679">1679</year></datestruct>-<num value="80">80</num>, in the Tower, on a charge of aiding the Popish Plot. In <datestruct value="1684--"><year reg="1684">1684</year></datestruct> he was elected President of the Royal Society, and held that honourable office for <num value="2">two</num> years in succession. Pepys had an extensive knowledge of naval affairs; and in <datestruct value="1690--"><year reg="1690">1690</year></datestruct> he published some <QUOTE>Memoirs relating to the State of the Royal Navy in England for <num value="10">ten</num> years, determined <datestruct VALUE="1688-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> He died in London in <datestruct value="1703--"><year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>In the early part of the present century the dockyard was closed for some years. It was reopened, however, with renewed vigour in <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>, from which time down to the period of its final closing in <datestruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct>, several <num value="1">first</num>-rate vessels were built and launched there, including the <hi rend=italics>Hannibal</hi>, the 
<hi rend=italics>Emerald</hi>, the <hi rend=italics>Termagant</hi>, the <hi rend=italics>Terrible</hi>, the <hi rend=italics>Spitfire,</hi>
 the <hi rend=italics>Leopard</hi>, the <hi rend=italics>Imperieuse</hi>, and   many others. But when iron began to supersede wood, and a heavier class of vessels was required for the purposes of war, the shallow water in the river opposite the slips, and other inconveniences of the site, caused the yard to be pretty much restricted to the building of gunboats, and it was finally decided to abandon the dockyard and to transfer the workmen to other establishments.   The last vessel launched   here was the   screw   corvette <hi rend=italics>Druid,</hi>
which took place in the presence of Princess Louise and Prince Arthur, on the <datestruct VALUE="1869-03-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct>. At the end of the same month the yard was finally closed. 
   <P>Shortly afterwards it became necessary, under the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, <datestruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct>, to provide a place for the sale and slaughter of foreign animals brought into the port of London, and the Corporation of the City of London having undertaken the duty, purchased the greater part of the old dockyard for about <measure value="95000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="95000">95,000</num></measure>, for the site of the new market. The works necessary for converting the place into a cattle-market amounted to about   <measure value="140000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="140000">140,000</num></measure>; and in <datestruct VALUE="1871-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>, it was opened under the title of the Foreign Cattle Market.   This market covers an area of about <num value="23">twenty-three</num> acres, and is provided with covered pens, each pen having its water-trough and foodrack, sufficient for sheltering <num value="4000">4,000</num> cattle and <num value="12000">12,000</num>   sheep; besides this, there is sufficient available open space for accommodating several thousands more.   The ship-building slips of the old dockyard, with   their immense roofs, were adapted as pen-sheds, and connected by ranges of substantial and well-ventilated buildings. The old workshops were converted into   slaughter-houses for oxen, the boat-houses for sheep, and fitted with travelling pulleys, cranes, and various mechanical appliances for saving labour and facilitating the slaughter of the animals. The market has a river frontage of about <num value="360">360</num> yards; and <num value="3">three</num> jetties, with a connected low-water platform, provide ample means for landing animals at all states of the tide. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1872--"><year reg="1872">1872</year></datestruct>, by order of the City officials, a board was put up in the Foreign Cattle Market, bearing the following inscription:-- <QUOTE>Here worked as a ship-carpenter Peter, Czar of all the Russias, afterwards Peter the Great, <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> The Czar's sojourn here is likewise commemorated by his name being given to a street in Deptford--a very wretched and woe-begone street, by the way, and quite unworthy of so illustrious a name. 
   <P>The Dockyard, though so important, was small, when compared with the others, as we learn from <pb id="P.150" n="150"> the following statement which appeared in a Kentish newspaper in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>The English dockyards extend over nearly <num value="500">500</num> acres.

   <P>Near the docks was the seat of John Evelyn, called Say's or Saye's Court, where, as stated above, Peter the Great, Czar of Muscovy, resided for some time whilst completing in the dockyard his knowledge and skill in the practical part of naval architecture. The mansion was originally the manor-house of the manor of West Greenwich, which had been presented by the Conqueror to Gilbert de Magnimot, who made it the head of his barony, and erected, it is said, a castle on the site, every vestige of which has long been swept away. After passing through the hands of numerous possessors, the manor was resumed by the Crown at the Restoration.   The manor-house with its surrounding estate, which had obtained the name of Saye's Court from its having been long held by the family of Says or Sayes, became in <datestruct value="1651--"><year reg="1651">1651</year></datestruct> the property of John Evelyn, the celebrated author of <QUOTE>Sylva.</QUOTE> It would appear that Evelyn's claim to

 Saye's Court was not based on a very secure footing, for he tells us in <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>-<num value="1">1</num> that he had repeated visits from his Majesty's surveyor <QUOTE>to take an account of what grounds I challeng'd at Saye's Court.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct> Charles II. granted a new lease at a reserved annual rental of <measure value="22s." type=currency><num value="22">22</num>s.</measure> 
   <P>The property, it appears, had been leased by the Crown to the family of the Brownes, <num value="1">one</num> of whom, Sir Richard Browne, in <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct>, purchased the greater portion of the manor. <QUOTE>A    <Q>representative of that ancient house,</Q> </QUOTE> writes Mr. James Thorne, in his <QUOTE>Environs of London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Sir Richard Browne, a follower of the Earl of Leicester, was a privy councillor and clerk of the Green Cloth, under Elizabeth and James I., and died at Saye's Court in <datestruct value="1604--"><year reg="1604">1604</year></datestruct>.

   <P>John Evelyn, whom Southey styles a <QUOTE>perfect model of an English gentleman,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>whose 
<title>Sylva</title>,</QUOTE> as Scott writes, <QUOTE>is still the manual of British planters,</QUOTE> married in <datestruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct> the only daughter and heir of the above-mentioned   Sir Richard Browne; and Sir Richard being resident in Paris, gave up Saye's Court to his son-in-law.   That Evelyn was located here soon after his marriage seems pretty certain, for in <datestruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct> we find an entry in his <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> to the effect that he <QUOTE>went through a course of chemistrie at Saye's Court.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The estate had been seized by the Parliamentary commissioners; but Evelyn succeeded in buying out, towards the close of <datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>, those who had purchased it of the Trustees of Forfeited Estates. Thenceforth he made Saye's Court his permanent residence, and at once set about the accomplishment of those works which helped so much to make the place classic ground. Under date <datestruct VALUE="1653-01-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>, he writes: <QUOTE>I began to set out the ovall Garden at Saye's Court, which was before a rude orchard, and all the rest <num value="1">one</num> intire field of <num value="100">100</num> acres, without any hedge, except the hither holly hedge joyning to the bank of the mount walk. This was the beginning of all the succeeding gardens, walks, groves, enclosures, and plantations there.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The chatty old diarist tells us all the secrets of his domestic life: how he <QUOTE>set apart in preparation for the B.

    <P>Evelyn resided chiefly at Saye's Court for the next <num value="40">forty</num> years of his life, carrying out there, as far as the site allowed, the views of gardening set forth in his <QUOTE>Sylva,</QUOTE> to the <QUOTE>great admiration</QUOTE> of his contemporaries. Occasionally royalty would <QUOTE>drop in</QUOTE> to pay him a visit, or to see how his work was progressing-facts which we find duly recorded in his <QUOTE>Diary.</QUOTE> For instance, Henrietta Maria, the widow   of Charles I.-the <QUOTE>Queen Mother,</QUOTE> as she was called-landed at Deptford, on her return to England, <datestruct VALUE="1662-07-28"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1662>1662</year></datestruct>, and was waited upon by John Evelyn, who entertained her, the Earl of St. Alban's, and the rest of her retinue, at Saye's Court. 
    <P>On the <datestruct VALUE="-04-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, in the following year, <QUOTE>came his Majesty to honour my poore villa with his presence, viewing the gardens and even every roome of the house, and was pleas'd to take a small refreshment.</QUOTE> 
    <P>He had, of course, many other visitors, Lord Clarendon and the Duke of York among them. <num value="1">One</num> entry in his <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> about this time is as follows:-- <QUOTE>Came my Lord Chancellor (the Earle of Clarendon) and his lady, his purse and mace borne before him, to visit me. They had all ben our old acquaintance in exile, and indeed this greate person had ever ben my friend. His sonn, Lord Cornbury, was here too.</QUOTE> 
   <P>But it was not only royal and political celebrities who visited Evelyn here; there was a welcome also for men of letters and science.   His <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> for <datestruct value="1673--"><year reg="1673">1673</year></datestruct> bears testimony to this fact. <QUOTE><datestruct VALUE="-06-27"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=27>27</day></datestruct>.

   <P>All this while his garden, we may be sure, was not neglected. <QUOTE>I planted,</QUOTE> he writes in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>all the out-limites of the garden and long walks with holly.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct>, on the <datestruct VALUE="-03-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, occurs this entry: <QUOTE>This Spring I planted the Home and West-field at Saye's Court with elmes, the same yeare they were planted in Greenewich Park.</QUOTE>

And among other rarities, a hive of bees, so as being hived in glass, you may see the bees making their honey and combs mighty pleasantly.</QUOTE> This was the transparent apiary already mentioned.   It was not merely in gardening that Evelyn was so proficient, for he appears to have been something of a poet, and to have cultivated a taste for the fine arts, if we may form any conclusion from the following entry in Pepys' <QUOTE>Diary:</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE><datestruct VALUE="1665-11-5"><day reg="5">5</day> <month reg="11">Nov.</month>, <year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>. By water to Deptford, and there made a visit to Mr. Evelyn, who, among other things, showed me most excellent paintings in little, in distemper, Indian-incke, water-colours, graveing, and, above all, the whole secret of mezzo-tinto, and the manner of it, which is very pretty, and good things done with it. He read to me very much also of his discourse, he hath been many years and now is about, about Gardenage; which will be a most noble and pleasant piece. He read me part of a play or <num value="2">two</num> of his making, very good, but not as he conceits them, I think, to be. He showed me his Hortus Hyemalis: leaves laid up in a book of several plants kept dry, which preserve colour, however, and look very finely, better than an herball. In fine, a most excellent person he is, and must be allowed a little for a little conceitedness; but he may well be so, being a man so much above others. He read me, though with too much gusto, some little poems of his own, that were not transcendant, yet <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> very pretty epigrams; among others, of a lady looking in at a grate, and being pecked at by an eagle that was there.</QUOTE> It is amusing to see <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> rival diarists of Charles II.'s reign portrayed by the other, and that must be our excuse for quoting the above sketch. 
   <P>Evelyn was, moreover, apparently a collector of <QUOTE>autographs,</QUOTE> or, at all events, he seems to have possessed a few treasures in this way; for a few days later we find Pepys paying him another visit, the entry of which records the fact that <QUOTE>among other things he showed me a lieger [ledger] of a treasurer of the navy, his great grandfather, just <num value="100">one hundred</num> years old, which I seemed mighty fond of; and he did present me with it, which I take as a great rarity, and he hopes to find me more older than it. He also showed me several letters of the old Lord of Leicester's, in Queen Elizabeth's time, under the very hand-writing of Queen Elizabeth, and Queen Mary, Queen of Scots, and others, very venerable names.

   <P>Evelyn stayed at Saye's Court during the plague, for he writes in <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>: <QUOTE>There died in our parish this year <datestruct value="406"><year reg="406">406</year></datestruct> of the pestilence,</QUOTE> and he afterwards tells us that his wife and family returned to him from Wotton, the ancient family seat near Dorking, in Surrey, when it was at an end.   In the MSS. preserved at Wotton, and quoted in the appendix to his <QUOTE>Memoirs,</QUOTE> Evelyn has left a pretty full account of what he did at Saye's Court: <QUOTE>The hithermost grove I planted about    <datestruct value="1656--"><year reg="1656">1656</year></datestruct>; the .other beyond it, <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>; the lower grove, <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>; the holly hedge, even with the mount hedge below, <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>. I planted every hedge and tree not onely in the garden, groves, &amp;c., but about all the fields and house since <datestruct value="1653--"><year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>, except those large, old, and hollow Elms in the Stable Court, and next the  Sewer; for it was before all <num value="1">one</num> pasture field to the very garden of the house, which was but small; from which time also I repaired the ruined house, and built the whole end of the kitchen, the chapel, buttry, my study (above and below), cellars, and all the outhouses and walls, still-house, Orangerie, and made the gardens, &amp;c., to my great cost, and better I had don to have pulled all down at <num value="1">first</num>; but it was don at several times.</QUOTE> 
   <P>It was in the neighbourhood of Saye's Court, in <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>, that Evelyn <num value="1">first</num> met with the celebrated sculptor, Grinling Gibbons, whom he afterwards befriended.

I found him   shut in; but looking in at the window I perceiv'd him carving that large cartoon or crucifix of Tintoret, a copy of which I had myselfe brought from   Venice.  I asked if I might enter; he open'd the door civilly to me, and I saw him about such a work as for the curiosity of handling, drawing, and studious exactnesse, I never had before seene in all my travells.   I questioned him   why he worked in such an obscure place; he told me it was that he might apply himselfe to his profession without interruption. I asked if he was unwilling to be made knowne to some greate man, for that I believed it might turn to his profit; he answer'd he was yet but a beginner, but would not be sorry to sell off that piece; the price he said <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>.   The very frame was worth the money, there being nothing in nature so tender and delicate as the flowers and festoons about it, and yet the work was very strong; in the piece were more than ioo figures of men.   I found he was likewise musical, and very civil, sober, and discreete in his discourse.</QUOTE> <pb id="P.154" n="154">

    <P>The following account of the life led by Peter the Great<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="81">81</num>.</NOTE> at Saye's Court we extract from   a  Memoir of his Life, in the <title>Family Library</title>:-- 
 <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p><num value="1">One</num> month's residence having satisfied Peter as to what was to be seen in London, and the monarch having expressed a strong desire to be near some of the king's dock-yards, it was arranged that a suitable residence should be found near <num value="1">one</num> of the river establishments; and the house of the celebrated Mr. Evelyn, close to Deptford Dockyard, being about to become vacant by the removal of Admiral Benbow, who was then its tenant, it was immediately taken for the residence of the czar and his suite; and a doorway was broken through the boundary wall of the dockyard, to afford a direct communication   between it and the dwelling-house.   This place had then the name of Saye's Court; it was the delight of Evelyn, and the wonder and admiration of all men of taste at that time.   The grounds are described, in   the  <Q>Life of the   Lord   Keeper Guildford,</Q>  as  <Q>most boscaresque,</Q>  being, as it were, an exemplary of his (Evelyn's)  <Q>Book of Forest Trees.</Q>    Admiral Benbow had given great dissatisfaction to the proprietor as a tenant, for the latter observes in his  <Q>Diary:</Q>   <Q>I have the mortification of seeing every day much of my labour and expense there impairing for want of a more polite tenant.</Q>  It appears, however, that the princely occupier was not a more  <Q>polite tenant</Q>  than the rough sailor had been, for Mr. Evelyn's servant thus writes to him :-- <Q> There is a house full of people, and right nasty. The czar lies next your library, and dines in the parlour next your study.   He dines at <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock, and <num value="6">six</num> at night, is very seldom at home a whole day, very often in the King's Yard, or by water, dressed in several dresses.   The king is expected here this day; the best parlour is pretty clean for him   to be entertained in.   The king pays for all he has.</Q>  But this was not all: Mr. Evelyn had a favourite holly hedge, through which, it is said, the czar, by way of exercise, used to be in the habit of trundling a wheel-barrow   every morning with his own royal hands.   Mr. Evelyn probably alludes to this in the following passage in his  <Q>Sylva,</Q>  wherein he asks, <Q>Is there under the heavens a more glorious and refreshing object, of the kind, than an impregnable hedge, of about <num value="400">four hundred</num> feet in length, <num value="9">nine</num> feet high, and <num value="5">five</num> in diameter, which I can still show in my ruined garden at Saye's Court (thanks to the Czar of Muscovy) at any time of the year, glittering with its armed and variegated leaves; the taller standards, at orderly distances, blushing with their natural coral?   It mocks the rudest assaults of the weather, <Q>beasts</Q>, or <Q>hedge-breakers <foreign lang=la>et illum nemo impune lacessit</foreign></Q>!</Q></QUOTE>

    <P> <QUOTE>While at Saye's Court,</QUOTE> writes Dr. Mackay, in his <QUOTE>Thames and its Tributaries,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>the czar received a visit from the great William Penn, who came over from Stoke Pogis to see him, accompanied by several other members of the Quaker body.   Penn and he conversed together in the  Dutch language; and the czar conceived from his manners and   conversation   such favourable notions of that peaceful sect, that during his residence at Deptford he very often attended the  Quaker meetings, conducting himself--if we may <pb id="P.155" n="155"> trust his biographers- <Q> with great decorum and condescension, changing seats, and sitting down, and standing up, as he could best accommodate others, although he could not understand a word of what was said.</Q> </QUOTE> If this be true, the czar was not so uncivilised a being after all. 
   <P>We have but little evidence, except tradition, that the czar, during his residence here, ever actually worked with his hands as a shipwright; it would seem he was employed rather in acquiring information on matters connected with naval architecture from the commissioner and surveyor of the navy, Sir Anthony Deane, who, next after the Marquis of Carmarthen, was his most intimate English acquaintance. His fondness for sailing and managing boats, however, was as eager here as in Holland, where he had studied some time before coming to England; and these gentlemen were almost daily with him on the Thames, sometimes in a sailingyacht, and at other times rowing in boats-an exercise in which both the czar and the marquis are said to have excelled.   The Navy Board received directions from   the Admiralty to hire <num value="2">two</num> vessels, to be at the command of the czar whenever he should think proper to sail on the Thames, in order to improve himself in seamanship. In addition to these, the king made him a present of the <hi rend=italics>Royal Transport</hi>, with orders to have such alterations made in her as his majesty might desire, and also to change her masts, riggings, sails, &amp;c., in any such way as he might think proper for improving her sailing qualities. But his great delight was to get into a small decked boat belonging to the dockyard, and, taking only Menzikoff and <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> others of his suite, to work the vessel with them, he being the helmsman; by this practice he said he should be able to teach them how to command ships when they got home. Having finished their day's work (as stated by us previously<NOTE>See Vol. II., p. <num value="99">99</num>.</NOTE>), they used to resort to a public-house in Great Tower Street, close to Tower Hill, to smoke their pipes, and drink their beer and brandy. The landlord had the Czar of Muscovy's head painted and put up for his sign, which continued till the year <datestruct value="1808"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>, when a person of the name of Waxel took a fancy to the old sign, and offered the then occupier of the house to paint him a new <num value="1">one</num> for it. A copy was accordingly made from the original, which remained in its position till the house was rebuilt, when the sign was not replaced, and the name only remains; it is now called the <QUOTE>Czar's Head.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The czar, in passing up and down the river, was much struck with the magnificent building of Greenwich Hospital, which, until he had visited it and seen the old pensioners, he had thought to be a royal palace; but <num value="1">one</num> day when King  William   asked how   he liked   his hospital for decayed seamen, the czar answered, <QUOTE>If I were the adviser of your majesty, I should counsel you to remove your court to Greenwich, and convert  St. James's into a hospital.</QUOTE> He little knew that  St. James's also was a hospital<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="100">100</num>.</NOTE> in its origin. 
   <P>While residing at Deptford, the czar frequently invited Flamsteed from the Royal Observatory at Greenwich to come over and dine with him, in order that he might obtain his opinion and advice, especially upon his plan of building a fleet. It is stated in Chambers's <QUOTE>Book of Days,</QUOTE> that the king promised Peter that there should be no impediment to his engaging and taking back with him to Russia a number of English artificers and scientific men; accordingly, when he returned to   Holland, there went with him   captains of ships, pilots, surgeons, gunners, mast-makers, boatbuilders, sail-makers, compass-makers, carvers, anchor-smiths, and copper-smiths; in all nearly <num value="500">500</num> persons. At his departure he presented to the king a ruby valued at <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>, which he brought in his waistcoat pocket, and placed in William's hand wrapped up in a piece of brown paper. 
   <P>Evelyn seems to have sustained a considerable loss by Peter's tenancy; for he writes in his <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> under date <datestruct VALUE="1698-06-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>: <QUOTE>I went to Deptford to see how miserably the czar had left my house after <num value="3">three</num> months' making it his court.   I got Sir Christopher Wren, the king's surveyor, and Mr. Loudon, his gardener, to go and estimate the repairs, for which they allowed   <measure value="150l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="150">150</num></measure> in their report to the Lords of the Treasury.</QUOTE> It appears, however, that in spite of having had such bad tenants in admirals and in royalty, Evelyn again let his house at Deptford to Lord Carmarthen, Peter's boon companion. 
    <P>Alas! for the glory of the glittering hollies, trimmed hedges, and long avenues of Saye's Court. Time, that great innovator, has demolished them all, and Evelyn's favourite haunts and enchanting grounds became in the end transformed into cabbage gardens and overrun with weeds. 
   <P>After Evelyn's death Saye's Court was neglected, and at the end of the last century Lysons writes, <QUOTE>There is not the least trace now either of the house or the gardens at Saye's Court; a part of the garden walls only with some brick piers are [is] <pb id="P.156" n="156"> remaining. The house was pulled down in <datestruct value="1728--"><year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct> or <datestruct value="1729--"><year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct>, and the workhouse built on its site.</QUOTE> That portion of the victualling yard where till recently oxen and hogs were slaughtered and salted for the use of the navy, now occupies the place of the shady walks and trimmed hedges in which the good old Evelyn so much delighted. On another part rows of mean cottages were built; and the only portion unappropriated was that left for the workhouse garden; this still remains. The private entrance through which Peter the Great passed into the dockyard from Saye's Court was in the wall close by, but is now bricked up. 
   <P>When Mr. Serjeant Burke was preparing for the press his <QUOTE>Celebrated Naval and Military Trials,</QUOTE> he visited Deptford. <QUOTE>But,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE>to look at Saye's Court now! The free-and-easy way of living, common to the rough seaman and the rude northern potentate, could not, in wildest mood, have contemplated   such a condition.   It has gradually sunk from bad to worse; it has been a workhouse, and has become too decayed and confined even for that. It is now attached to the dockyard, as a kind of police-station and place for paying off the men. The large hall, used for 
<FIGURE id="Fig.156" n="2000.14.0057"><HEAD>Deptford Creek.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 the latter purpose, was no doubt the scene of many a jovial night spent by the admiral and his successor, the czar. What remains of Evelyn's garden is now a wilderness of weeds and rank grass, hemmed in by a dingy wall which shuts out some of the filthiest dwellings imaginable. The avenue of hovels through which we passed from the abode of former greatness bore the name of Czar Street, a last lingering memento of the imperial sojourn.   The illustrious czar was so great a man that he could nowhere set his foot without leaving an imprint behind. A monument to him is not needed; but it would be pleasing tc have found in Deptford some memorial carved in brass or stone of our gallant Benbow. Yet, after all, it matters not much while the British public, ever mindful of greatness in the British navy, permits no oblivion to rest on his personal worth, his achievements, and his fame.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The workhouse mentioned above is still standing, though it has long since ceased to be used as such. It is a large brick-built house of <num value="2">two</num> storeys, oblong in shape, and with a tiled roof. The rooms are low-pitched, and about a dozen in number; some of them are about <num value="30">thirty</num> feet long, and those on <pb id="P.157" n="157">

 <pb id="P.158" n="158"> the ground floor are paved with brick. There is nothing in the building to show that it was ever occupied by persons of affluence; but, in spite of this fact, there is in Deptford and its neighbourhood a general and fondly-cherished impression that it is Saye's Court, and the identical house in which the Czar lived.   Mr. Thorne, in his <QUOTE>Environs of London,</QUOTE> considers that the house <QUOTE>looks more like an adaptation of a part of the old house than a building of the year <datestruct value="1729"><year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> It may, perhaps, have been <num value="1">one</num> of the offices or outbuildings of the original mansion. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct>, on the closing of the dockyard, Mr. W. J. Evelyn,   of Wotton--the present representative of the family of the author of <QUOTE>Sylva,</QUOTE> and the owner of some considerable part of the parish of Deptford-determined to purchase back from the Government as much of the site of Saye's Court as was available, to restore it to something like its original condition, and to throw it open to the inhabitants as a recreation-ground.   The transformation is now (<datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>) nearly effected. There are about <num value="14">fourteen</num> acres of open ground; but <num value="4">four</num> of these remain attached to the old house above mentioned, which has been made to serve as the residence of <num value="1">one</num> of the labourers on the estate. The public garden and playground is therefore about <num value="10">ten</num> acres in extent. It has been carefully laid out in grass plats, hedged with flowers and shrubs, in part planted with trees, and intersected by broad and level walks. All the shrubs, flowers, and trees, together with the sod which forms the lawn and borders the walks, are said to have been brought from Wotton.   In the centre of the ground is a covered stage for a band; and in <num value="1">one</num> corner has been erected a large building which is eventually to serve as a museum and library. It is a pity that the name of the author of <QUOTE>Sylva</QUOTE> is not identified with this recreation-ground, which might well be called Evelyn Park. 
    <P>We are told that in former times the king's household used to be supplied with corn and cattle from the different counties; and oxen being sent up to London, pasture grounds in the various suburbs were assigned   for their maintenance.  Among these were lands near Tottenham Court, and others at Deptford, which were under the direction of the Lord Steward and the Board of  Green Cloth. A certain Sir Richard Browne had the superintendence of those at Deptford; and this fact may explain the entry in Evelyn's <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> already mentioned, where he records the visit of the Comptroller of that Board <QUOTE>to survey the land at Saye's Court, to which I had pretence, and to make his report.</QUOTE> 
   <P>To the north-west of Deptford was the <QUOTE>Red House,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>so called as being a collection of warehouses and storehouses built of red bricks.</QUOTE> This place was burnt down in <datestruct VALUE="1639-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1639">1639</year></datestruct>, it being then filled with hemp, flax, pitch, tar, and other commodities.   The Victualling Office, in former times called the <QUOTE>Red House,</QUOTE> from its occupying the site of the above-mentioned storehouses, is now an immense pile, erected at different times, and consisting of many ranges of buildings, appropriated to the various establishments necessary in the important concern of victualling the navy. The full official title of the place is now the <QUOTE>Royal Victoria Victualling Yard.</QUOTE> On the old <QUOTE>Red House</QUOTE> being rebuilt, it was included in the grant of Saye's Court to Sir John Evelyn, in <datestruct value="1726--"><year reg="1726">1726</year></datestruct>, and was then described as <num value="870">870</num> feet in length, thirtyfive feet wide, and containing <num value="100">100</num> warehouses. The whole of the land comprised in the present yard has been purchased from time to time from the Evelyn family, the last addition being made to it in <datestruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct>, when some portion of the gardens formerly attached to old Saye's Court was purchased from   Mr. W. J. Evelyn.   The premises were for some time rented by the East India Company; but on their being re-purchased of the Evelyns by the Crown, a new   victualling house was built on the spot in <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>, to replace the old victualling office on Tower Hill.   This new building was also accidentally burnt down in <datestruct value="1749--"><year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>, with great quantities of stores and provisions. It was, however, subsequently rebuilt, and now comprises extensive ranges of stores, workshops, and   sheds, with river-side wharf, and all the necessary machinery and appliances for loading and unloading vessels and carrying on the requisite work in the yard.   This place is the depot from which the <num value="2">two</num> other victualling yards-those at Devonport and Gosport--are furnished, and is considerably the largest of the <num value="3">three</num>.   From it the navy is supplied with provisions, clothing, bedding, medicines, and medical comforts, &amp;c. In former times, and down to a comparatively recent date, cattle were slaughtered here; but this has been abandoned.   At the proper season, however, beef and pork are received in very large quantities, and salted and packed in barrels; meat boiled and preserved in tin canisters, on Hogarth's system of preserving; wheat ground; biscuits made; and the barrels in which all are stored manufactured in a large steam cooperage.   The stock of medicine constantly kept in store is sufficient for <num value="5000">5,000</num> men for <num value="6">six</num> months; but the demand for it is so great and regular that supplies arrive and leave almost daily.   The general direction of the yard rests with <pb id="P.159" n="159"> a resident superintending storekeeper, and in all about <num value="500">500</num> persons are employed on the establishment. 
    <P>On the west side of the Royal Victualling Yard is a goods depot of the Brighton and South-Coast  Railway. It occupies the site of what was formerly  Dudman's Dock, and comprises a basin and quay for the landing of goods from vessels coming up the Thames, and also extensive ranges of storehouses, &amp;c.   It is connected with the abovementioned railway by a branch line from New  Cross, which passes over the Deptford Lower  Road. 
    <P> <QUOTE>Besides its dock and victualling yard,</QUOTE> writes  Dr. Mackay, in his <QUOTE>Thames and its Tributaries,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Deptford is noted for <num value="2">two</num> hospitals, belonging to the Corporation of the Trinity House, or the pilots of London.   A grand procession comes (<datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>) from London to these hospitals annually on Trinity  Monday, accompanied by music and banners, and is welcomed by the firing of cannon.</QUOTE> Trinity  Monday, we need scarcely say, was a <QUOTE>red-letter day</QUOTE> in Deptford down to the time when these visits of the Corporation of the Trinity House ceased, which was in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, on the death of the  Duke of Wellington, who had for many years held the office of Master. We have in a previous volume<NOTE>See Vol. II., p. <num value="115">115</num>.</NOTE> given an account of the foundation of the above-mentioned corporation, and also of the duties appertaining to the society; we may, however, remark here that Lambarde, in his <QUOTE>Perambulations of Kent</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1570--"><year reg="1570">1570</year></datestruct>), writes concerning Deptford-or, as he spells it, Depeforde-- <QUOTE>This towne, being a frontier betweene Kent and Surrey, was of none estimation at all, untill that King Henry the VIII. advised (for the better preservation of the royall fleete) to erect a storehouse, and to create certaine officers there; these he incorporated by the name of the Maister and Wardeins of the Holie Trinitie, for the building, keeping, and conducting of the  Navie Royall.</QUOTE> It would appear from this that  Henry VIII. established the Trinity House about the same time that he constituted the Admiralty and the Navy Office.   Charles Knight, in his <QUOTE>London,</QUOTE> however, says that <QUOTE>some expressions in the earliest charters of the corporation that have been preserved, and the general analogy of the history of English corporations, lead us to believe that Henry merely gave a new charter, and entrusted the discharge of important duties to a guild or incorporation of seamen which had existed long before.   When there was no permanent royal navy, and even after <num value="1">one</num> had been <num value="1">1</num> created, so long as vessels continued to be pressed in war time as well as men, the King of England had to repose much more confidence in the wealthier masters of the merchant-service than now.   They were at sea what his feudal chiefs were on shore.    Their guild, or brotherhood, of the Holy Trinity of Deptford Strond was probably tolerated at <num value="1">first</num> in the assumption of a power to regulate the entry and training of apprentices, the licensing of journeymen, and the promotion to the rank of master in their craft, in the same way as learned and mechanical corporations did on shore.   To a body which counted among its members the best mariners of Britain, came not unusually to be entrusted the ballastage and pilotage of the river.   By degrees its jurisdiction came to be extended to such other English ports as had not, like the   Cinque Ports, privileges and charters of their own; and in course of time the jurisdiction of the Trinity   House became permanent in these matters, with the exception of the harbours we have named, over the whole coast of England from a little way north of Yarmouth on the east to the frontiers of   Scotland on the west.   Elizabeth, always ready to avail herself of the costless service of her citizens, confided to this corporation the charge of English sea-marks. When lighthouses were introduced, the judges pronounced them   comprehended in the terms of Elizabeth's charter, although a right of chartering private lighthouses was reserved to the   Crown. When the navigation laws were introduced by Cromwell, and re-enacted by the government at the Restoration, the Trinity House presented itself as an already organised machinery for enforcing the regulations respecting the number of aliens admissible as mariners on board a British vessel.   James II., when he ascended the throne, was well aware of the use that could be made of the Trinity   House, and he gave it a new charter, and the constitution it still retains, nominating as the <num value="1">first</num> master of the reconstructed corporation his invaluable Pepys.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The establishment of the Corporation of the  Trinity House here is a proof that Deptford was already a rendezvous for shipping and the resort of seamen. The ancient hall in Deptford, at which the meetings of this society were formerly held, was taken down about the beginning of the present century, and the building erected on Tower Hill, which we have already noticed in the volume above referred to. Evelyn, in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date of  <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, writes: <QUOTE>I dined with the Trinity Company at their house, that corporation being by charter fixed at Deptford.</QUOTE> Evelyn's wife, as it appears from   his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> gave to the Trinity House <pb id="P.160" n="160"> Corporation the site for their college, or almshouses. 
   <P>Notwithstanding that the Corporation of the Trinity House ceased to hold their meetings here after the building of their new hall, their connection with Deptford was till very recently marked by their <num value="2">two</num> hospitals for decayed master mariners and pilots and their widows.   In the <QUOTE>Ambulator</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>) we thus read: <QUOTE>In this town are <num value="2">two</num> hospitals, of which <num value="1">one</num> was incorporated by King Henry VIII., in the form of a college for the use of the seamen, and is commonly called  <Q>Trinity House of Deptford Strond.</Q>  This contains <num value="21">twenty-one</num> houses, and is situated near the church. The other, called Trinity Hospital, has <num value="38">thirty-eight</num> houses fronting the street. This is a very handsome edifice, and has large gardens, well kept, belonging to it.   Though this lastnamed is the finest structure of the <num value="2">two</num>, yet the other has the preference, on account of its antiquity; and as the Brethren of the Trinity hold their corporation by that house, they are obliged at certain times to meet there for business. Both these houses are for decayed pilots, or masters of ships, or their widows, the men being allowed <num value="20">twenty</num> and the women <measure value="16s." type=currency><num value="16">sixteen</num> shillings</measure> a month.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Both these buildings have within the last few years been <QUOTE>disestablished,</QUOTE> so far as their use as almshouses is concerned.   <num value="1">One</num> of them, a triangular block of houses, comprising about <num value="20">twenty</num> dwellings standing on the green at the back of St. Nicholas' Church, a short distance eastward from the Foreign Cattle Market, is at present let out in weekly tenements; the other, known as the <QUOTE>Trinity House, Deptford,</QUOTE> was a large and noteworthy old red-brick quadrangular pile, fronting Church Street, and overlooking the burial-ground of St. Paul's Church. It was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1664--"><year reg="1664">1664</year></datestruct>-<num value="5">5</num>, and was demolished, with the exception of the hall, in the early part of the year <datestruct value="1877"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>, to make room for a new street, and a row of private houses in Church Street. In the great hall at the back of the building, which has been left standing, the Master and Elder Brethren of the Trinity House used, down to the period above mentioned, to assemble on Trinity Monday, and, after transacting the formal business, walk in state to the parish church of St. Nicholas, where there was a special service and sermon. On the conclusion of the ceremony in Deptford the company returned to London in their state barges, the shipping and wharves on the Thames being gaily decked with bunting in honour of the occasion, and the proceedings of the day closed with a grand banquet at the Trinity House. Both the meeting and the banquet are now held at the new Trinity House on Tower Hill, and the sermon is preached in Pepys' favourite church of St. Olave, Hart Street, near the Custom House and Corn Exchange. 
   <P>The town of Deptford contains, as we have stated above, <num value="2">two</num> parish churches, dedicated re spectively to St. Nicholas and St. Paul, besides which there are the churches of <num value="4">four</num> recentlyformed ecclesiastical districts, together with several chapels of all denominations. The old church of St. Nicholas, the patron saint of seafaring men, occupies the site of a much older edifice, and, with the exception of the tower, dates from the end of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. John Evelyn, in his <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> for <datestruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct>, records the building of <QUOTE>a pretty new church</QUOTE> here. The ancient church, it appears, was pulled down in <datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>, in consequence of its being found inadequate to the wants of the increasing population. Whatever beauty the new church may have possessed in Evelyn's eyes, it does not seem   to have been very substantially built, for it underwent a <QUOTE>thorough restoration</QUOTE> before <num value="20">twenty</num> years had passed away. The body of the church is a plain dull red-brick structure, consisting of nave, aisles, and chancel. At the western end is an embattled tower of stone and flint, somewhat patched; this tower is of the Perpendicular period, or early part of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century, and the only relic of the old church. The interior contains a few monuments of some former Deptford worthies, among them <num value="1">one</num> of Captain Edward Fenton, who accompanied Sir Martin Frobisher in his <num value="2">second</num> and <num value="3">third</num> voyages, and had himself the command of an expedition for the discovery of a north-west passage; another of Captain George Shelvocke, who was bred to the sea-service under Admiral Benbow, and who, <QUOTE>in the years of Our Lord <datestruct value="1719--"><year reg="1719">1719</year></datestruct>, &lsquo;<num value="20">20</num>, &lsquo;<num value="21">21</num>, and &lsquo;<num value="22">22</num>, performed a voyage round the globe of the world, which he most wonderfully, and to the great loss of the Spaniards, compleated, though in the midst of it he had the misfortune to suffer shipwreck upon the Island of Juan Fernandez, on the coast of the kingdom of Chili.</QUOTE> He died in <datestruct value="1742--"><year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct>. Another monument records the death, in <datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>, of Peter Pett, a <QUOTE>master shipwright in the King's Yard,</QUOTE> whose family were long distinguished for their superior talents in ship-building, and who was himself the inventor of that once useful ship of war, the frigate.   The register of this church records also the burial here of Christopher Marlowe, or Marlow, the dramatist. He was born in <datestruct value="1563--"><year reg="1563">1563</year></datestruct>-<num value="4">4</num>. The son of a shoemaker at Canterbury, and having been educated in the King's School of that city, he took his degree in due course at Cambridge. <pb id="P.161" n="161"> On quitting college he became connected with the stage, and was <num value="1">one</num> of the most celebrated of Shakespeare's immediate predecessors. He is styled by Heywood the <QUOTE>best of poets;</QUOTE> and this may possibly have been true, for no great dramatist preceded him, whilst his fiery imagination and strokes of passion communicated a peculiar impulse to those who came after him. He was the author of <num value="6">six</num> tragedies, and joined with Nash and Day in the production of <num value="2">two</num> others. The plots of his pieces assumed a more regular character than those of previous dramatists, and no doubt he would have become even more celebrated if he had not been cut off in a strange affray. The entry in the parish register runs simply thus:-- <QUOTE><datestruct VALUE="1593-06-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1593">1593</year></datestruct>. Christopher Marlow, slaine by Francis Archer.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In this church lie the <num value="2">two</num> sons of John Evelyn, whose early deaths he records in his <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> for <datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>, in the most touching phrases. Sir Richard Browne, Evelyn's father-in-law, the owner of Saye's Court, died there in <datestruct value="1683--"><year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>, and was buried at his own desire outside this church, under the southeast window--not in the interior, considering that interments in churches were unwholesome.   He was evidently in advance of his age. 
   <P>Before passing on to St. Paul's Church, we may remark that Dr. Lloyd, curate of Deptford in  Evelyn's day, was promoted to the see of Llandaff, and that the register of the old church contains records of the following instances of longevity:--  Maudlin Augur, buried in <datestruct VALUE="1672-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>, aged  <num value="106">106</num>; Catherine Perry, buried in <datestruct VALUE="1676-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>by her own report, <num value="110">110</num> years old;</QUOTE> Sarah Mayo, buried in <datestruct VALUE="1705-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1705">1705</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="102">102</num>; and Elizabeth  Wiborn, buried in <datestruct VALUE="1714-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct>, in her <num value="101">101</num>st year. 
   <P>The church of St. Paul, a good example of the  Romanesque style, is situated between the High  Street and Church Street, near the railway station.  It was built in <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, on the division of Deptford into <num value="2">two</num> parishes, as above stated; and was <num value="1">one</num> of the churches <QUOTE>erected under the provisions of certain acts passed in the reign of Queen Anne, for the building of <num value="50">fifty</num> new churches in and near  London.</QUOTE> It is a solid-looking stone building, with a semi-circular flight of steps and a portico of  Corinthian columns at the western end, above which rises a tapering spire; the body of the fabric consists of nave, aisles, and a shallow chancel, the roof being supported by <num value="2">two</num> rows of Corinthian columns. The heavy galleries, old-fashioned pews, carved pulpit, and dark oak fittings of the chancel, impart to the interior a somewhat sombre effect. among the monuments in this church is <num value="1">one</num> by  Nollekens, in memory of Admiral Sayer, who <QUOTE><num value="1">first</num> planted the British flag in the island of  Tobago,</QUOTE> and who died in <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>. In the churchyard is the tomb of Margaret Hawtree, who died in <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>; it is inscribed as follows :-- 
 <QUOTE REND=blockquote> She was an indulgent mother, and the best of wives;    She brought into this world more than <num value="3000">three thousand</num> lives!</QUOTE>
The explanation of this, as Lysons informs us, is that she was an <QUOTE>eminent midwife,</QUOTE> and that she evinced the interest she took in her calling by giving a silver basin for christenings to this parish, and another to that of St. Nicholas. Dr. Charles Burney, the Greek scholar and critic, whose large classical library was purchased after his death, in <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>, for the British Museum, was for some time rector of St. Paul's.   The rectory-house, on the south side of the churchyard, is a singular-looking red-brick structure, said to have been built from the designs of Vanbrugh. 
   <P>Close by the station on the London and Green, wich Railway, which here crosses the High Street, is the Roman Catholic Church of the Assumption. It is a plain brick-built structure, with lancet windows and an open roof, and was commenced in <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>. A temporary chapel, which had been provided in the previous year, was, on the opening of the church, made to do duty as a school. Adjoining the church is a presbytery, which was built in <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>. The Roman Catholics are somewhat numerous in Deptford, a fact which may perhaps be attributed to the large number of Irish formerly employed in the dockyard and on the wharves in the neighbourhood. Close by, are St. Vincent's Industrial School (Roman Catholic) and the Deptford Industrial Home and Refuge for Destitute Boys. 
   <P>In Evelyn Street, as the thoroughfare connecting the High Street with the Deptford Lower Road is called, stands St. Luke's Church, a substantial and well-built Gothic edifice, erected in <datestruct value="1872--"><year reg="1872">1872</year></datestruct>, mainly at the cost of the present head of the Evelyn family, Mr. William J. Evelyn, of Wotton. 
   <P>Near St. Luke's Church the Grand Surrey Canal passes under the roadway at the end of Evelyn Street, on its way towards Camberwell and Peckham. <hi rend=italics>Apropos</hi> of canals, we may state that in the 
<hi rend=italics>Monthly Register</hi> for <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, it is announced, with becoming gravity, that <QUOTE>Another canal of great national importance is about to be constructed from Deptford to Portsmouth and Southampton, passing by Guildford, Godalming, and Winchester.</QUOTE> After giving the estimate, the editor remarks in a manner which, with our subsequent experience of half a century and more, will cause a smile: <QUOTE>A <pb id="P.162" n="162"> canal, in this instance, is to be preferred to an iron railway road, because the expense of carriage by a canal is much cheaper than that of carriage by a railway. It has been found, for instance, that <num value="60">sixty</num> tons of corn could not be carried from Portsmouth to London for less than <measure value="125l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="125">125</num></measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure>; but that by a canal the same quantity of grain may be conveyed the same distance for an expense not exceeding <measure value="49l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="49">49</num></measure> <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure></QUOTE> We need scarcely add that this canal was never carried out. 
   <P>Among the most famous residents of Deptford, besides the Czar Peter and John Evelyn, Dr. Mackay enumerates Cowley, the poet, and the Earl of Nottingham, Lord High Admiral of England, who played so leading a part in the defeat of the Spanish Armada. <QUOTE>The house which he inhabited,</QUOTE> writes Dr. Mackay, <QUOTE>was afterwards converted into a tavern and named the  <Q>Gun;</Q>  and his armorial bearings, sculptured over the chimneypiece of the principal apartment, were long shown to curious visitors.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The name of John Evelyn is so closely associated with the past history of Deptford, that we may be pardoned for closing this chapter with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> amusing scraps of information concerning

It appeared <num value="1">first</num> below Greenwich at low water, for at high ,water it would have destroyed all the boats; but lying now in shallow water, incompassed with boats, after a long conflict it was killed with a harping yron, struck in the head, out of which it spouted blood and water by <num value="2">two</num> tunnells, and after a horrid grone it ran quite on shore and died. Its length was <num value="58">fifty-eight</num> foote, height <num value="16">sixteen</num>, black skin'd like coach-leather, very small eyes, greate taile, and onely <num value="2">two</num> small finns, a picked snout, and a mouth so wide that divers men might have stood upright in it; on teeth, but suck'd the slime onely as thro&lsquo; a grate of that bone which we call whale-bone; the throate yet so narrow as would not have admitted the least of fishes. The extremes of the cetaceous bones hang downwards from   the upper jaw; and was hairy towards the ends and bottom within-side; all of it prodigious; but in nothing more wonderful than that an animal of so greate a bulk should be <pb id="P.163" n="163"> nourished onely by slime through those grates.</QUOTE> Again, under date <datestruct VALUE="1699-03-26"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=26>26</day>, <year reg=1699>1699</year></datestruct>: <QUOTE>After an extraordinary storm there came up the Thames a whale <num value="56">fifty-six</num> feet long.

   <P>At another time Evelyn gravely tells us how he dined with the Archbishop of Canterbury, at Lambeth, and stayed late, <QUOTE>and <hi rend=italics>yet</hi> returned to Deptford at night.</QUOTE> What would he have said now, in these days of tram-cars and railways?

 trade in this great metropolis; and, as might be expected, the side streets of the town swarm with <num value="2">second</num>-hand shops, some of which, it is to be feared, are made repositories for stolen goods. <num value="1">One</num> of these shops, with its sign of a huge black doll. is graphically described   by M    Alphonse Esquiros, in the <num value="2">second</num> series of his <QUOTE>English at Home.</QUOTE> He enters into the traditional origin of the black doll as a sign, as <num value="1">first</num> adopted by a woman who, travelling abroad, brought back with her a black baby as a speculation, but finding that such an article had no value in England, wrapped it up in a bundle of rags and sold it to <num value="1">one</num> of the founders of the trade. The little nigger was reared at the expense of the parish-so goes the <pb id="P.164" n="164"> storygrew up and married, opened a shop in this same line of business, made a fortune, and is said to have been the ancestress of all the dealers from that day to this. In order to account for this fact, it is said that she and her children started <num value="50">fifty</num> shops, at each of which a black doll was hung out as a sign. Some of these dolls have <num value="3">three</num> heads, and, if we may believe M. Esquiros, this is a symbol of the trade extending through the <num value="3">three</num> kingdoms.   It is only fair, however, to add that he remarks, <QUOTE>I am afraid that the explanation given by the owners of these shops will not satisfy antiquaries, who have adopted a far more probable opinion, namely, that these repositories are the successors of the old shops where Indian and Chinese curiosities were sold, and which had a  <Q>joss </Q> --a sort of Chinese idol--for their sign.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The rag and bottle shops are the places whence rags are supplied to the wholesale dealer, who sells them to the owners of the paper-mills which abound near Dartford. It is not a little singular, however, that many of the rags have crossed the seas, and have found their way to England from Germany and   even from   India and Australia. Charles Dickens, in his <title>Sketches by Boz</title>, mentions the marine store shops of Lambeth, and also those of the neighbourhood of the King's Bench prison. Is it possible that he could have been ignorant of their connection with Deptford, or of the'romantic story above mentioned?

<P>The town and parliamentary borough of Greenwich, which we now enter, lies immediately eastward of Deptford, from which parish it is separated by the river Ravensbourne.   As to the origin of the name, Lambarde, in his <QUOTE>Perambulations of Kent,</QUOTE> says that in Saxon times it was styled <hi rend=italics>Grenevic-</hi>
that is, the <QUOTE>green town;</QUOTE> and the transition from 
<hi rend=italics>vic</hi> to <hi rend=italics>wich</hi> in the termination is easy. Lambarde adds that in <QUOTE>ancient evidences</QUOTE> it was written <QUOTE>East Greenewiche,</QUOTE> to distinguish it from Deptford, which, as we have already stated, is called <QUOTE>West Greenewiche</QUOTE> in old documents.   Under the name of West Greenwich it returned <num value="2">two</num> members to Parliament, in the reign of Elizabeth; but no fresh instance of such an honour is recorded in its subsequent history. Down to about the time of Henry V. the place was known chiefly as a fishing-village, being adapted to that use by the secure road or anchorage which the river afforded at this spot.   It was a favourite station with the old   Northmen, whose <QUOTE>host</QUOTE> was frequently encamped on the high ground southward and eastward of the town, now called Blackheath. In the reign of King Ethelred, when the Danes made an attack on London Bridge, a portion of their fleet lay in the river off Greenwich, whilst the re. mainder was quartered in the Ravensbourne Creek at Deptford.   It was to Greenwich that, after their raid upon Canterbury in <datestruct value="1011--"><year reg="1011">1011</year></datestruct>, the Dane. brought Archbishop Alphege to their camp, where he was kept a prisoner for several months; and the foundation of the old parish church of Greenwich, which we shall presently notice, was probably intended to mark the public feeling as to the memorable event that closed his personal history. A native of England, St. Alphege was <num value="1">first</num> abbot of Bath, then Bishop of Winchester, in A.D. <datestruct value="984"><year reg="984">984</year></datestruct>, and <num value="12">twelve</num> years later translated to the see of Canterbury. On the storming of that city by the Danes under Thurkill, in the year above mentioned, he distinguished himself by the courage with which he defended the place for <num value="20">twenty</num> days against their <pb id="P.165" n="165"> assaults.   Treachery, however, then opened the gates, and Alphege, having been made prisoner, was loaded with chains, and treated with the greatest severity, in order to make him   follow the example of his worthless sovereign Ethelred, and purchase an ignominious liberty with gold. Greenwich, as we have stated, at that time formed the Danish head-quarters, and hither the archbishop was conveyed. Here he was tempted by the offer of a lower rate of ransom; again and again he was urged to yield by every kind of threat and solicitation. <QUOTE>You press me in vain,</QUOTE> was the noble Saxon's answer; <QUOTE>I am not the man to provide Christian flesh for Pagan teeth by robbing my poor countrymen to enrich their enemies.</QUOTE> At last the patience of the heathen Danes was worn out; so <num value="1">one</num> day, after an imprisonment of <num value="7">seven</num> months' duration (the <datestruct VALUE="1012-04-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1012">1012</year></datestruct>--on which day his festival is still kept in the Roman Catholic Church), they sent for the archbishop to a banquet, when their blood was inflamed by wine, and on his appearance saluted him with tumultuous cries of <QUOTE>Gold! gold! Bishop, give us gold, or thou shalt to-day become a public spectacle.</QUOTE> Calm and unmoved, Alphege gazed on the circle of infuriated men who hemmed him in, and who presently began to strike him with the flat sides of their battle-axes, and to fling at him the bones and horns of the oxen that had oeen slain for the feast. And thus he would have been slowly murdered, but for <num value="1">one</num> Thrum, or Guthrum, a Danish soldier, who had been converted by Alphege, and who now in mercy smote him with the edge of his weapon, when he fell dead. <QUOTE>It is storied,</QUOTE> writes Hone, in his <QUOTE>Everyday Book,</QUOTE> quoting from the <QUOTE>Golden Legend,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>that when St. Alphege was imprisoned at Greenwich, the devil appeared to him in the likeness of an angel, and tempted him to follow him into a dark valley, over which he wearily walked through hedges and ditches, till at last, when he was stuck in a most foul mire, the devil vanished, and a real angel appeared, and told St. Alphege to go back to prison and be a martyr; and so he gained a martyr's crown.   Then after his death, an old rotten stake was driven into his body, and those who drove it said, that if on the morrow the stake was green, and bore leaves, they would believe; whereupon the stake flourished, and the drivers thereof repented, as they said they would, and the body being buried at St. Paul's Church, in London, worked miracles.</QUOTE>

   <P>From the encampments of the Danes in this place may possibly be traced the names of East Coombe and West Coombe, <num value="2">two</num> estates on the borders of <hi rend=italics>Blackheath-coomb</hi>, as well as <hi rend=italics>comp</hi>

    <P>The manor of Greenwich, called in the early records East Greenwich, as we have already seen, belonged formerly to the abbey of St. Peter at Ghent.   It remained in the possession of the monks, however, but for a very short time, being seized by the Crown upon the disgrace of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux. At the dissolution of the alien priories it was granted by King Henry V. to the monastery of Sheen, or Richmond. Henry VI. granted it to his uncle, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, who was so pleased with the spot that he built on it a palace, extending, with its various courts and gardens, from the river to the foot of the hill on which the Observatory now stands. Upon his death it became again the property of the Crown. The royal manors of East and West Greenwich and of Deptford-le-Strond still belong to the sovereign, whose chief steward has his official residence at Macartney House, on Blackheath. 
   <P>According to Lysons, in his <QUOTE>Environs of London,</QUOTE> however, there appears to have been a royal residence here as early as the reign of Edward I., when that monarch <QUOTE>made an offering of <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">seven</num> shillings</measure> at each of the holy crosses in the chapel of the Virgin Mary, at Greenwicke, and the prince an offering of half that sum;</QUOTE> though by whom the palace was erected is not known.

The grant of <num value="200">200</num> acres of land in Greenwich, made by Henry VI. to Duke Humphrey, in <datestruct value="1433--"><year reg="1433">1433</year></datestruct>, was for the purpose of enclosing it as a park. <num value="4">Four</num> years later the duke and Eleanor, his wife, obtained a similar grant, and in it licence was given to its owners to <QUOTE>embattle and build with stone</QUOTE> their manor of Greenwich, as well as <QUOTE>to enclose and make a tower and ditch within the same, and a certain tower within the park to build and edify.</QUOTE> Accordingly, soon after this, Duke Humphrey commenced building the tower within the park, now the site of the Royal Observatory, which was then called <LEMMA id="lemma.166.2">Greenwich Castle</LEMMA>; and he likewise rebuilt the palace on the spot where the west wing of the Royal Hospital-or, more properly speaking, Royal Naval College--now stands, which he named from its agreeable situation, Pleazaunce, or Placentia; but this name was not commonly used until the reign of Henry VIII. Edward IV. enlarged the park, and stocked it with deer, and then bestowed the palace as a residence upon his queen, Elizabeth Woodville. In this reign a <pb id="P.166" n="166"> royal joust or tournament was performed at Greenwich, on the occasion of the marriage of Richard, Duke of York, with Anne Mowbray.   In <datestruct value="1482--"><year reg="1482">1482</year></datestruct> the Lady Mary, the king's daughter, died here; she was betrothed to the King of Denmark, but died before the solemnisation of the marriage.

He then enlarged the palace, adding a brick front towards the riverside; finished the tower in the park, which had been commenced by Duke Humphrey; and built a convent adjoining the palace for the Order of the Grey Friars, who came to Greenwich about the latter end of the reign of Edward IV., <QUOTE>from whom,</QUOTE> says Lambarde, <QUOTE>they obtained, in <datestruct value="1480--"><year reg="1480">1480</year></datestruct>, by means of Sir William   Corbidge, a chauntrie, with a little Chapel of the Holy Cross.</QUOTE> The convent above mentioned, after its dissolution in the reign of Henry VIII., was re-founded by Queen Mary, but finally suppressed by Elizabeth soon after her accession.

This monarch spared no expense to render Greenwich Palace magnificent; and, perhaps from partiality to the place of his birth, he resided chiefly in it, neglecting for it the palace at Eltham, which had been the favourite residence of his ancestors. Many sumptuous banquets, revels, and solemn jousts, for which his reign was celebrated, were held at his <QUOTE>Manor of Pleazaunce.</QUOTE> On the <datestruct VALUE="1509-06-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1509">1509</year></datestruct>, Henry's marriage with <LEMMA id="lemma.166.3">Catherine of Arragon</LEMMA> was solemnised here.

In <datestruct value="1512--"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct> the king kept his Christmas at Greenwich <QUOTE>with great and plentiful cheer,</QUOTE> and in the following year <QUOTE>with great solemnity, dancing, disguisings, mummeries, in a most princely manner.</QUOTE> In an account of Greenwich and Hampton Court Palaces, in <hi rend=italics>Chambers'  Journal</hi>, the writer observes:-- <QUOTE>Henry VIII., up to middle age, always kept Christmas with great festivity at <num value="1">one</num> or other of these palaces. Artificial gardens, tents, &amp;c., were devised in the hall, out of which came dancers, or knights, who fought. After a few years Henry contented himself with a duller  Christmas, and generally gambled a good deal on the occasion. In the brief reign of Edward VI. a gentleman named Ferrers was made the  <Q> Lord of  Misrule,</Q>  and was very clever in inventing plays and interludes.   The money lavished on these entertainments was enormous; <num value="1">one</num> of his lordship's dresses cost <measure value="52l." type=currency><num value="52">fifty-two</num> pounds</measure>, and he had besides a train of counsellors, gentlemen ushers, pages, footmen, &amp;c.   Mary and   Elizabeth both kept  Christmas at Hampton Court; but the entertainments of the latter were far gayer than those of her sister.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The following amusing account of these Christmas festivities may be appropriately quoted here from  Hall's <QUOTE>Chronicles :</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>The king, after Parliament was ended, kept a solemne Christemas at Grenewicke to chere his nobles, and on the twelfe daie at night, came into the hall a mount, called the riche mount.   The mount was sett ful of riche flowers of silke, and   especially full of brome slippes full of coddes; the braunches wer grene sattin, and the flowers flat gold of damaske, whiche signified Plantagenet. On the top stode a goodly bekon, gevyng light; rounde about the bekon sat the Kyng and <num value="5">five</num> other, al in coates and cappes of right crimosin velvet, embroudered with flat golde of damaske; the coates set full of spangelles of gold. And <num value="4">four</num> woodhouses drewe the mount till it came before the Quene, and then the Kyng and his compaignie descended and daunced; then sodainly the mount opened, and out came sixe ladies, all in crimosin satin and plunket embroudered with gold and perle, and  French hoddes on their heddes, and thei daunced alone. Then the lordes of the mount took the ladies, and daunced   together; and the ladies re-entred, and the mount closed, and   so was conveighed out of the hall.   Then the Kyng shifted hym and came to the Quene, and sat at the banqute, which was very sumpteous.</QUOTE> At the Christmas festivities in <datestruct value="1515--"><year reg="1515">1515</year></datestruct> was introduced the <num value="1">first</num> masquerade ever seen in England. The following account of it and the other ceremonies on the occasion, given in the work above quoted, may not prove uninteresting, as it affords some insight into the amusements of the period:-- <pb id="P.167" n="167"> <QUOTE>The Kyng this yere kept the feast of Christmas at Grenewich, wher was such abundance of viandes served to all comers of any honest behaviors, as hath been few times seen; and against New-yere's night was made, in the hall, a castle, gates, towers, and dungeon, garnished with artilerie and weapon after the most warlike fashion; and on the frount of the castle was written, <hi rend=italics>Le Fortresse dangerus;</hi>
and within the castle wer <num value="6">six</num> ladies clothed in russet satin laid all over with leves of golde, and every owde knit with laces of blewe silke and golde, on ther heddes coyfes and cappes all of gold.   After this castle had been carried about the hal [hall], and the Quene had behelde it, in came the Kyng with <num value="5">five</num> other appareled in coates, the <num value="1">one</num> halfe of russet satyn spangled with spangels of fine gold, and the other halfe rich clothe of gold; on ther heddes caps of russet satin, embroudered with workes of fine gold bullion.

   <P>At the palace here both of the daughters of Henry VIII., Mary and Elizabeth, <num value="1">first</num> saw the light.   On the <datestruct VALUE="1515-05-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1515">1515</year></datestruct>, the marriage of Mary, Queen Dowager of France (Henry's sister), with Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, was publicly solemnised in the parish church of Greenwich. 
   <P>Of the many splendid receptions and sumptuous entertainments of foreign princes and ministers, that which was given here in <datestruct value="1527--"><year reg="1527">1527</year></datestruct> to the French ambassadors appears to have been particularly striking; so much so, in fact, that honest old John Stow is obliged to confess that he <QUOTE>lacked head of fine wit, and also cunning in his bowels,</QUOTE> to describe it with sufficient eloquence. This embassy, we are told, that it might correspond with the English Court in magnificence, consisted of <num value="8">eight</num> persons of high quality, attended by <num value="600">six hundred</num> horse ; they were received with the greatest honours, <QUOTE>and entertained after a more sumptuous manner than had ever been seen before.</QUOTE> The great tilt-yard was covered over, and converted into a banqueting-room.   The Hampton Court banquet given by Wolsey to the same personages just before was, says the annalist, a marvellously sumptuous affair; yet this at Greenwich excelled it <QUOTE>as much as gold excels silver,</QUOTE> and no beholder had ever seen the like. <QUOTE>In the midst of the banquet there was tourneying at the barriers, with lusty gentlemen in complete harness, very gorgeous, on foot; then there was tilting on horseback with knights in armour, still more magnificent; and after this was an interlude or disguising, made in Latin, the players being in the richest costumes, ornamented with the most strange and grotesque devices. This done,</QUOTE> Stow further tells us, <QUOTE>there came such a number of the fairest ladies and gentlewomen that had any renown of beauty throughout the realm, in the most rich apparel that could be devised, with whom the gentlemen of France danced, until a gorgeous mask of gentlemen came in, who danced and masked with these ladies. This done, came in another mask of ladies, who took each of them <num value="1">one</num> of the Frenchmen by the hand to dance and to mask.   These women maskers every <num value="1">one</num> spoke good French to the Frenchmen, which delighted them very much to hear their mother tongue.

It was on the <datestruct VALUE="1533-05-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1533">1533</year></datestruct>, and Father Thames had never before borne on his bosom so gallant an array. <num value="1">First</num> of all the mayor and aldermen, with their scarlet robes and golden chains, followed by the common councilmen in their robes, and by all the officers of the City in their costume, with triumphant music swelling upon the ear, and their gay banners floating upon the breeze, walked down to the water-side, where they found their own barges ready to receive them, and <num value="50">fifty</num> other barges filled with the various City companies, awaiting the signal of departure. Then, amid the firing of cannon, and the braying of trumpets, the procession started. A foist, or large flat-bottomed boat, <pb id="P.168" n="168"> took the lead, impelled by several fellows dressed out to represent devils, who at intervals spouted out blue and red flames from their mouths, and threw balls of fire into the water.    <Q>Terrible and monstrous wild men they were,</Q>  says Stow,  <Q>and made a hideous noise. In the midst of them sat a great red dragon, moving itself continually about, and discharging fire-balls of various colours into the air, whence they fell into the water with a hissing sound. Next came the Lord Mayor's barge, attended by a small barge on the right side filled with musicians. It was richly hung with cloth of gold and silver, and bore the <num value="2">two</num> embroidered banners of the king and queen, besides escutcheons splendidly wrought in every part of the vessel. On the left side was another foist, in the which was a mount, and on the mount stood a white falcon, crowned, upon a root of gold, environed with white and red roses, which was the Queen's device, and about the mount sat virgins, singing and playing melodiously.</Q>  Then came the sheriffs and the aldermen, and the common councilmen and the City companies, in regular procession, each barge having its own banners and devices, and most of them being hung with arras and cloth of

On May-day in that year Henry instituted a grand tournament in Greenwich Park, at which the queen and her brother, Lord Rochford, were present. The sports were at their height, when the king, without uttering a word to his queen or anybody else, suddenly took his departure, apparently in an illhumour, and proceeded to London, accompanied by <num value="6">six</num> domestics. All the tilters were surprised and chagrined; but their surprise and chagrin were light in comparison to those of Anne Boleyn. The <pb id="P.170" n="170"> very same night her brother and his friends, Norris, Brereton, Weston, and Smeton, were arrested and conveyed up the river to the Tower, bound like felons.

   <P>Henry VIII. at <num value="1">one</num> period   of his reign was so much attached to Greenwich Palace, that he passed more of his time there than at any of his other royal abodes.

Such, at least, is Hasted's translation of Leland's Latin verses. During the reign of the <num value="2">two</num> succeeding sovereigns, Greenwich lost that renown for gaiety which it had acquired from   the festivals and constant hospitality of Henry VIII.

   <P><LEMMA id="lemma.170.2">Mary</LEMMA>, too, during her brief reign, was an occasional resident at the Palace of Placentia.   It is recorded that on <num value="1">one</num> occasion of her sojourn here a very singular accident occurred. The captain of a vessel proceeding down the Thames, observing the banner of England floating from   the walls, fired the customary salute in honour of royalty. By some oversight the gun was loaded, and the ball was driven through the wall into the queen's apartments, to the great terror of herself and her ladies. None of them, however, received any hurt. 
   <P>With   the   reign   of Elizabeth   the   glories of Greenwich revived.   It was her birthplace, and the favourite residence of her unfortunate mother; and during the summer months it became, for the <pb id="P.171" n="171"> greater part of her reign, the principal seat of her Court.   In the year of her accession she here reviewed a large force of companies, raised by the citizens of London in consequence of the Duke of Norfolk's conspiracy. The number of men present on this occasion was <num value="1400">1,400</num>, and the proceedings included a mock fight in the park, which, we are told, <QUOTE>presented all the appearances of a regular battle, except the spilling of blood.</QUOTE> The following is the account of the <QUOTE>entertainment,</QUOTE> as told by Miss Agnes Strickland, in her <QUOTE>Lives of the Queens of England :</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>The Londoners were so lovingly disposed to their maiden sovereign, that, when she withdrew   to her summer bowers at Greenwich, they were fain to devise all sorts of gallant shows to furnish excuses for following her there, to enjoy from time to time the sunshine of her presence. They prepared a sort of civic tournament in honour of her Majesty, <datestruct VALUE="-07-2"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=2>2nd</day></datestruct>, each company supplying a certain number of men at arms, <num value="1400">1,400</num> in all, all clad in velvet and chains of gold, with guns, morris pikes, halberds, and flags, and so marched they over London Bridge, into the Duke of Suffolk's park, at Southwark, where they mustered   before the Lord Mayor; and, in order to initiate themselves into the hardships of a campaign, they lay abroad in St. George's Fields all that night. The next morning they set forward in goodly array, and entered Greenwich Park at an early hour, where they reposed themselves till <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock, and then marched down into the lawn, and mustered in their arms, all the gunners being in shirts of mail. It was not, however, till eventide that her Majesty deigned to make herself visible to the   doughty bands of Cockaine-chivalry they cannot properly be called, for they had discreetly avoided exposing civic horsemanship to the mockery of the gallant equestrians of the Court, and trusted no other legs than their own with the weight of their valour and warlike accoutrements, in addition to their velvet gaberdines and chains of gold, in which this midsummer bevy had bivouacked in St. George's Fields on the preceding night. At <num value="5">five</num> o'clock the queen came into the gallery of Greenwich Park gate, with the ambassadors, lords, and ladies--a fair and numerous company--to witness a tilting match, in which some of the citizens, and several of her grace's courtiers took part.</QUOTE> 
   <P>While Elizabeth kept Court at her natal palace of Greenwich, she regularly celebrated the national festival on St. George's Day, with great pomp, as the Sovereign of the Order of the Garter, combining, according to the custom of the good old times, a religious service with the picturesque ordinances of this chivalric institution. <QUOTE>All her Majesty's chapel came through the hall in copes, to the number of <num value="30">thirty</num>, singing,  <Q> O   God the Father of heaven,</Q>  &amp;c., the outward court to the gate being strewed with green rushes.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Elizabeth's <num value="1">first</num> chapter of the Order of the Garter was certainly held in St. George's Hall, at Greenwich; for we find that the same afternoon she went to Baynard's Castle, the Earl of Pembroke's place, and supped with him, and after supper she took boat, and was rowed up and down on the river Thames, hundreds of boats and barges rowing about her, and thousands of people thronging the banks of the river to look upon her Majesty, all rejoicing at her presence, and partaking of the music and sights on the Thames. It seems there was an aquatic festival, in honour of the welcome appearance of their new and comely liege lady on the river; for the trumpets blew, drums beat, flutes played, guns were discharged, and fireworks played off, as she moved from place to place. This continued till <datestruct value="10"><year reg="10">ten</year></datestruct> o'clock, when the queen departed home. 
   <P>Great hospitality was exercised in the palace at Greenwich, which no stranger who had ostensible business there, from the noble to the peasant, ever visited, it is said, without being invited to either <num value="1">one</num> table or the other, according to his degree. No wonder that Elizabeth was a popular sovereign, and her days were called <QUOTE>golden;</QUOTE> for the way to an Englishman's heart is a good dinner. 
   <P>The royal park was the scene of a good story, thus told by Miss Agnes Strickland:-- <QUOTE><num value="1">One</num> of her majesty's purveyors having been guilty of some abuses in the county of Kent, on her removal to Greenwich, a sturdy countryman, watching the time when she took her morning walk with the lords and ladies of her household, placed himself conveniently for catching the royal eye and ear, and when he saw her attention perfectly disengaged, began to cry, in a loud voice,  <Q>Which is the queen?</Q>  Whereupon, as her manner was, she turned herself towards him, but he continuing his clamorous question, she herself answered,  <Q>I am your queen; what wouldst thou have with me?</Q>   <Q> You,</Q>  rejoined the farmer, archly gazing upon her with a look of incredulity, not unmixed with admiration- <Q>you are <num value="1">one</num> of the rarest women I ever saw, and can eat no more than my daughter Madge, who is thought the properest lass in our parish, though short of you; but that Queen Elizabeth I look for devours so many of my hens, ducks, and capons, that I am not able to live.</Q>  The queen, who was exceedingly indulgent to all suits, offered through the medium of a compliment, took this <pb id="P.172" n="172"> homely admonition in good part, inquired the purveyor's name, and finding that he had acted with great dishonesty and injustice, caused condign punishment to be inflicted upon him;</QUOTE> indeed, our author adds that <QUOTE>she ordered him to be hanged, his offence being in violation of a statute-law against such abuses.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Holinshed relates in his <QUOTE>Chronicle,</QUOTE> that in <datestruct value="1562--"><year reg="1562">1562</year></datestruct>, at the reception of the Danish ambassadors here, there was a bull-bait, at the end of which the people were delighted with the sight of a horse with an ape on his back--a sight which, no doubt, gave birth to the sign named among those of London <num value="2">two</num> centuries ago, in the <hi rend=italics>Spectator</hi>,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>Spectator</hi>, No. <num value="28">28</num>, <datestruct VALUE="1711-04-2"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=2>2</day>, <year reg=1711>1711</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> the <QUOTE>Jackanapes on Horseback.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The old annalists make constant mention of other proceedings of Elizabeth at Greenwich.   <num value="1">One</num> interesting ceremony which has been described was that enacted on Maundy Thursday, on <datestruct VALUE="1572-03-19"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=19>19</day>, <year reg=1572>1572</year></datestruct>. The Court being then located here, the queen, according to ancient custom, washed the feet of the poor on that festival, in remembrance of our Saviour washing the feet of the apostles. <QUOTE>Elizabeth will scarcely be blamed in modern times,</QUOTE> writes Agnes Strickland, <QUOTE>because she performed the office daintily.   The palace hall,</QUOTE> she continues, <QUOTE>was prepared with a long table on each side, with benches, carpets, and cushions, and a cross-table at the upper end, where the chaplain stood.   <num value="39">Thirty-nine</num> poor women, being the same number as the years of her Majesty's age at that time, entered, and were seated on the forms; then the yeoman of the laundry, armed with a fair towel, took a silver basin filled with warm water and sweet flowers, and washed all their feet, <num value="1">one</num> after the other; he likewise made a cross a little above the toes, and kissed each foot after drying it; the sub-almoner performed the same ceremony, and the queen's almoner also. Then her Majesty entered the hall, and went to a priedieu and cushion, placed in the space between the <num value="2">two</num> tables, and remained during prayers and singing, and while the gospel was read, how Christ washed His apostle's feet. Then came in a procession of <num value="39">thirty-nine</num> of the queen's maids of honour and gentlewomen, each carrying a silver basin with warm water, spring flowers, and sweet herbs, having aprons and towels withal.   Then her Majesty, kneeling down on the cushion placed for the purpose, proceeded to wash, in turn, <num value="1">one</num> of the feet of each of the poor women, and wiped them with the assistance of the fair bason-bearers; moreover, she crossed and kissed them, as the others had done. Then, beginning with the <num value="1">first</num>, she gave each a sufficient broad cloth for a gown, and a pair of shoes, a wooden platter, wherein was half a side of salmon, as much ling, <num value="6">six</num>. red herrings, <num value="2">two</num> manchetts, and a mazer, or wooden cup, full of claret. All these things she gave separately. Then each of her ladies delivered to her Majesty the towel and the apron used in the ablution, and she gave each of the poor women <num value="1">one</num> a-piece. This was the conclusion of the ladies' official duty of the maundy. The treasurer of the royal chamber, Mr. Heneage, brought her Majesty <num value="39">thirty-nine</num> small white leather purses, each with <measure value="39d." type=currency><num value="39">thirty-nine</num> pence</measure>, which she gave separately to every poor woman. Mr. Heneage then supplied her with <num value="39">thirty-nine</num> red purses, each containing <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure>; this she distributed to redeem the gown she wore, which by ancient custom was given to <num value="1">one</num> chosen among the number.</QUOTE> Our readers will remember that part, but part only, of the same ceremony is still annually performed by some representative of the sovereign on each Maunday Thursday, at Whitehall.<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="368">368</num>.</NOTE>

    <P>In Hentzner's <title>Itinoarium</title> (<title>A Journey into England </title>), written at the close of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, will be found a graphic account of the court of Queen Elizabeth, at Greenwich Palace, in the latter years of her reign. The writer tells us how he was admitted to the Presence Chamber, which he found hung with rich tapestry, and the floor, <QUOTE>after the English fashion, strewed with hay</QUOTE> [rushes].   It was a Sunday, when the attendance of visitors was greatest; and there were waiting in the hall the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London, a great number of councillors of state, officers of the court, foreign ministers, noblemen, gentlemen, and ladies.   At the door stood a gentleman dressed in velvet, with a gold chain, ready to introduce to the queen any person of distinction who came to wait upon her.   The queen passed through the hall on her way to prayers, preceded in regular order by gentlemen, barons, earls, knights of the Garter, all richly dressed and bareheaded.   Immediately before the queen came the Lord Chancellor, with the seals in a red silk purse, between <num value="2">two</num> officers bearing the royal sceptre and the sword of state. The queen wore a dress of white silk, bordered with pearls of the size of beans, her train borne by a marchioness.   As she turned on either side, all fell on their knees. She <QUOTE>spoke graciously <num value="1">first</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, then to another, whether foreign ministers, or those who attended for different reasons, in English, French, and Italian.</QUOTE> The ladies of the court, <pb id="P.173" n="173"> <QUOTE>very handsome and well-shaped, and for the most part dressed in white, followed next to her, and <num value="50">fifty</num> gentlemen pensioners, with gilt battle-axes, formed her guard.</QUOTE> In the ante-chamber, next the hall, she received petitions most graciously; and   to   the   acclamation, <QUOTE>Long   live Queen Elizabeth!</QUOTE> she answered, <QUOTE>I thank you, my good people.</QUOTE> After the service in the chapel, which lasted only half an hour, the queen returned in the same state as she had entered. The table had been set <QUOTE>with great solemnity</QUOTE> in the banquetingroom, but the queen dined in her inner and private chamber. <QUOTE>The queen dines and sups alone, with very few attendants; and it is very seldom that anybody, foreign or native, is admitted at that time, and then only at the intercession of somebody in power.</QUOTE> The German traveller is particular in describing with exact minuteness the personal appearance of the queen, who was then in her <num value="65">sixty-fifth</num> year, and <QUOTE>very majestic:</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>her face,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>was oblong, fair but wrinkled; her eyes small, yet black and pleasant; her nose a little hooked; her lips narrow, and her teeth black (a defect the English seem subject to, from their too great use of sugar).   She had in her ears <num value="2">two</num> pearls with very rich drops; she wore false hair, and that red. Upon her head she had a small crown.   Her bosom   was uncovered, as all the English ladies have it till they marry; and she had a necklace of exceeding fine jewels.</QUOTE> We may add here that in Walpole's <QUOTE>Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors</QUOTE> there is a curious head of Queen Elizabeth when old and haggard, done with great exactness from a coin, the die of which was broken. A   striking feature in the queen's face was her high nose, which is not justly represented in many pictures and prints of her. She was notoriously vain of her personal charms, and, affirming that shadows were unnatural in painting, she ordered <num value="1">one</num> artist, Isaac Oliver, to paint her without any.   There are <num value="3">three</num> engravings of her Majesty after this artist, <num value="2">two</num> by Vertue, and <num value="1">one</num>, a whole length, by Crispin de Pass, who published portraits of illustrious personages of this kingdom during the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century. 
    <P>Greenwich Palace was, as we have just seen, much mixed up with the domestic life of Queen Elizabeth; but it was not all sunshine with her, as the following episode, told by Miss Agnes Strickland, will show:-- <QUOTE>The terror of the plague was always uppermost in the minds of all persons in the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, at every instance of sudden death.   <num value="1">One</num> day, in   <datestruct VALUE="1573-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1573">1573</year></datestruct>, Queen Elizabeth was conversing with her ladies in her privy chamber, at Greenwich Palace, when, on a sudden, the <Q>mother of the maids</Q> was seized with illness, and expired directly in her presence. Queen Elizabeth was so much alarmed at this circumstance, that in less than an hour she left her palace at Greenwich, and went to Westminster, where she remained.</QUOTE> 
    <P>On the return of Sir Walter Raleigh to England, with a high reputation for courage and discretion, after successfully quelling the disturbances of the Desmonds, in Munster, he was introduced to Queen Elizabeth at Greenwich Palace, and soon obtained a prominent position in the Court.   His advancement is said to have been greatly promoted by an almost fantastic display of gallantry, which he made on <num value="1">one</num> occasion before the queen.   He was, it is stated by some historians, <QUOTE>attending her Majesty in a walk, when she came to a place where her progress was obstructed by a mire. Without a moment's hesitation he took off his rich plush cloak, and spread it on the ground for her footcloth.   She was highly pleased with this practical flattery, and it was afterwards remarked that this sacrifice of a cloak gained him many a <hi rend=italics>good suit</hi>.</QUOTE> The grounds of Saye's Court have been fixed upon by some writers as the scene of this little episode; others, however, state that Raleigh placed his cloak on the landing-stage opposite the palace at Greenwich on <num value="1">one</num> occasion when her Majesty alighted from her barge, the customary floor-cloth having by some oversight been forgotten. 
    <P>The antiquarian reader will not have forgotten the fact that ladies, when as yet coaches had not been invented and introduced into England, were accustomed to make their journeys on horseback, seated on pillions behind some relative or servingman.   In this way Queen Elizabeth, when she went up to London from her palace at Greenwich, used to seat herself behind her Lord Chancellor or Chamberlain. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1605--"><year reg="1605">1605</year></datestruct> James I. settled Greenwich Palace and  Park on his queen, Anne of Denmark, who forthwith rebuilt with brick the garden front of the palace, and laid the foundation of a building near the park, called the <QUOTE>House of Delight,</QUOTE> in which the governor of Greenwich Hospital afterwards resided, and which now forms the central building of the Royal Naval Schools.   In the following year the Princess Mary, daughter of James I., was christened at Greenwich with great solemnity. 
    <P>Charles I. resided much at Greenwich previous to the breaking out of the civil war; and Henrietta Maria so <QUOTE>finished and furnished</QUOTE> the house which Anne of Denmark had begun, that, as Philipott, the IKentish historian, wrote, <QUOTE>it far surpasseth all other houses of the kind in England.</QUOTE> Inigo <pb id="P.174" n="174"> Jones was employed as the architect to superintend the work carried on in the building, and it was completed in <datestruct value="1635--"><year reg="1635">1635</year></datestruct>. Rubens was frequently in attendance on the Court of Charles at Greenwich; and it is stated that Queen Henrietta was anxious to form a cabinet of pictures here, and to have the ceilings and walls of her oratory and other rooms painted by Jordaens or Rubens, and that negotiations were entered into with those painters for the purpose, but pecuniary or political difficulties intervened.   Most of the ceilings in the palace were subsequently painted for Charles I. by Gentileschi. Some idea of the general external appearance of the palace at this time may be obtained from what is called <QUOTE>The Long View of Greenwich,</QUOTE> printed in <datestruct value="1637--"><year reg="1637">1637</year></datestruct>; it is to be seen among the etchings of Hollar, in a few choice collections. It was originally dedicated to Queen Henrietta Maria; and it is said that Hollar worked this plate for a publisher for <measure value="30s." type=currency><num value="30">thirty</num> shillings</measure>! The latter, finding the queen's unpopularity to interfere with the sale of the plate, induced Hollar to erase the dedication, and to substitute in its place a copy of verses which are found in some impressions.   In the foreground is the observatory hill and park, with ladies promenading,

 and in the distance we see the parish church, and the shipping on the river. The palace, by the river-side, appears as an irregular Gothic structure with <num value="2">two</num> towers. In the middle distance stands a more modern mansion, apparently in the middle of a corn-field. As already mentioned by us,<NOTE>See Vol. II., p. <num value="87">87</num>.</NOTE> over the buttery there formerly stood <num value="2">two</num> rude wooden figures, known as <QUOTE>Beer</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>Gin;</QUOTE> they are now in the Tower of London. 
   <P>King Charles left Greenwich palace with the fatal resolution of taking his journey northward, and the turbulent state of the times prevented him from again visiting it.

John Evelyn, in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date of <datestruct VALUE="1652-04-29"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=29>29</day>, <year reg=1652>1652</year></datestruct>, writes: <QUOTE>We went this afternoone to see the Queene's House at Greenwich, now given by the rebells to Bulstrode Whitlock, <num value="1">one</num> of their unhappy counsellors and keepers of pretended liberties.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1654--"><year reg="1654">1654</year></datestruct>, when the Crown lands were sold, Greenwich was reserved, and eventually it was appropriated to the Lord Protector as a residence. On the restoration of Charles II., in <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, it reverted to the Crown, with the other royal demesnes. The king, finding the old palace greatly decayed by time, and the want of necessary repairs during the Commonwealth, ordered it to be taken down, and a new palace was commenced in its place. <num value="1">One</num> wing of this new palace was completed at a cost of   <measure value="36000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="36000">36,000</num></measure>, and now forms, with additions, the west wing of the present edifice. Sir John Denham, the poet, was at that time the royal surveyor, or official architect; but as he knew little of building practically, he employed Webb, the son-in-law of Inigo Jones, from whose papers his designs are said to have been made.   Evelyn evidently did not think much of Sir John's qualifications as an architect, for he writes in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date of <datestruct VALUE="1661-10-19"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=19>19</day>, <year reg=1661>1661</year></datestruct>: <QUOTE>I went to London to visite my Lord of Bristoll, having <num value="1">first</num> been <hi rend=italics>(sic</hi>) with Sir John Denham (his Majesty's surveyor), to consult with him about the placing of his palace at Greenwhich, which I would have had built between the river and the Queenes house, so as a large square cutt should have let in the Thames like a bay; but Sir John was for setting it on piles at the very brink of the water, which I did not assent to, and so came away, knowing Sir John to be a better poet than architect.</QUOTE>

    <P>The widowed Queen of Charles I., Henrietta  Maria, spent several months at Greenwich after the restoration of her son; bonfires were lit to greet her on her arrival here. She continued to keep her Court in England till <datestruct VALUE="1665-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, when she finally embarked for France. She died at Colombe, near Paris, in <datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>; and her son, James II., says of her that <QUOTE>she excelled in all the good qualities of a good wife, a good mother, and a good Christian.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Notwithstanding the apparent eagerness of King  Charles II., at <num value="1">first</num>, for the construction of the palace and the improvements of the grounds, he seems to have given up the idea of continuing the work after the completion of the wing mentioned above, and nothing further was done to the building either by him or his successor to the crown.  As William III. divided his time between Ken sington and Hampton Court, Greenwich was no longer thought of as a royal residence; but Queen  Mary conceived even a nobler use for the then unfinished building. Charles II. had, in <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct>, laid the foundation of the hospital at Chelsea for disabled soldiers; but this was only completed by  William and Mary in <datestruct value="1690--"><year reg="1690">1690</year></datestruct>.   Mary, we are told, thought there should be a similar hospital for disabled seamen. <QUOTE>Amid the rejoicings called forth by the great victory of La Hogue, in <datestruct VALUE="1692-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1692">1692</year></datestruct>, the feelings of the queen were harrowed by the large number of maimed and wounded soldiers landed   at our naval ports.   William   was in  Holland, and Mary, as his vicegerent, after making every possible provision for the wounded, now publicly declared in her husband's name that the building commenced by Charles should be completed, and should be a retreat for seamen disabled in the service of their country.</QUOTE> As such we shall deal with it in the foilowing chapter. <pb id="P.177" n="177">

<P>The reader will not have forgotten the account which Macaulay gives of the causes which led to the foundation of <LEMMA id="lemma.177.1">Greenwich Hospital</LEMMA>, immediately after the death of Queen Mary, the Consort of William   III. <QUOTE>The affection with which her husband cherished her memory,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE>was soon attested by a monument, the most superb that was ever erected to any sovereign.   No scheme had been so much her own, none had been so near her heart, as that of converting the palace into a retreat for seamen. It had occurred to her when she had found it difficult to provide good shelter and good attendance for the thousands of brave men who had come back to England wounded after the battle of La Hogue. Whilst she lived, scarcely any step was taken towards the accomplishment of her favourite design; but it should seem that, as soon as her husband had lost her, he began to reproach himself for having neglected her wishes. No time was now lost. A plan was furnished by Wren, and soon an edifice, surpassing that asylum which the magnificent Louis had provided for his soldiers, rose on the margin of the Thames. Whoever reads the inscription which runs round the frieze of the hall will observe that King William claims no part of the merit of the design, and that the praise is ascribed to Mary alone.   Had the king's life been prolonged, a statue of her who was the real foundress of the institution would have had a conspicuous place in that court which presents <num value="2">two</num> lofty domes and <num value="2">two</num> graceful colonnades to the multitudes who are perpetually passing up and down the imperial river. But that part of the plan was never carried into effect; a few of those who now gaze on the noblest of European hospitals are aware that it is a memorial of the virtues of the good Queen Mary, of the love and sorrow of William, and of the great victory of La Hogue.</QUOTE> 
    <P>This magnificent structure, which is considered tne finest specimen of classical architecture in this or almost any other country, occupies the site of the old royal palace, on the southern bank of the  Thames, between that river and Greenwich Park.

    <P>In March of the following year, the king appointed nearly <num value="200">two hundred</num> commissioners; including George, Prince of Denmark; the principal <pb id="P.178" n="178"> Officers of State; the Archbishops, Bishops, Judges, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London; and the Masters, Wardens, &amp;c., of the Trinity House. John Evelyn gives us, in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> an accurate account of the successive steps taken by himself and his brother commissioners in establishing the hospital, of which he was appointed treasurer. The <num value="1">first</num> meeting of the commissioners was held at the Guildhall, <datestruct VALUE="1695-05-5"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=5>5th</day>, <year reg=1695>1695</year></datestruct>, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Godolphin, the Duke of Shrewsbury, and Sir Christopher Wren, and others being present. In the course of that month several other meetings were held, at which Evelyn, Wren, and <num value="2">two</num> other commissioners, having gone to Greenwich to survey the place, made a report to the effect that <QUOTE>the standing part (of the palace) might be made serviceable at present for <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure>,</QUOTE> and what extent of ground would be requisite in order to complete the design. The draft of the hospital was settled in the following April, and the <num value="1">first</num> stone of the new edifice laid on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, by Evelyn himself, supported by Wren and Flamsteed, <QUOTE>the king's astronomical professor.</QUOTE> Evelyn records even the exact hour at which the ceremony took place: <QUOTE>Precisely at <num value="5">five</num> o'clock in the evening, after we had dined together; Mr. Flamsteed observing the punctual time by instruments.</QUOTE> Evelyn's salary, as treasurer, was <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure>, much of the work being done by his son-in-law Draper, as his deputy, though the works as they progressed kept him at Saye's Court, away from his beloved Wotton, during the entire summer. Draper, we may add, succeeded Evelyn in the treasurership. The subscriptions received during the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="12">twelve</num> months towards the hospital amounted, according to Evelyn, to upwards of <measure value="9000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="9000">9,000</num></measure>, including <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure> from the king, and <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> apiece from nearly all the leading statesmen. According to a note by the treasurer, <num value="4">four</num> months after the foundation, the work done amounted to upwards of <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure>, towards which the treasurer had received only <measure value="800l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="800">800</num></measure>, there being among the defaulters the king's <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>, paid by exchequer tallies on the Post Office, <QUOTE>which,</QUOTE> says he, <QUOTE>nobody will take at <num value="30">30</num> per cent. discount,</QUOTE> a statement which, if true, does not redound to King Charles's credit. Part of the expense of the erection of the structure was raised by state lotteries.   Evelyn writes, in his <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> for <datestruct VALUE="1699-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct>: <QUOTE>All lotteries, till now cheating the people, to be no longer permitted than to Christmas, except that for the benefit of Greenwich Hospital.</QUOTE> From an entry which he makes in his <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> in <datestruct VALUE="1705-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1705">1705</year></datestruct>, it appears that the building was so far advanced that the committee had already admitted some pensioners: <QUOTE>I went to Greenwich Hospital, where they now begin to take in wounded and worn-out seamen, who are exceedingly well provided for.</QUOTE> He adds, <hi rend=italics>more suo</hi>, <QUOTE>The buildings now going on are very magnificent.</QUOTE> In a note in Evelyn's <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> is published his debtor and creditor account for the erection of the hospital. The total of subscriptions, &amp;c., seems to have been <measure value="69320l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="69320">69,320</num></measure>, exclusive of the produce of lottery tickets, <measure value="11434l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="11434">11,434</num></measure>, and malt tickets, <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure>; but the exact meaning of this last item is not very clear. 
   <P>The hospital is elevated on a terrace upwards of <num value="280">280</num> yards in length, and in its completed form consists of <num value="4">four</num> distinct blocks of building. The <num value="2">two</num> blocks nearest the river, known respectively as King Charles's and Queen Anne's Buildings, stand on either side of the <QUOTE>Great Square,</QUOTE> <num value="570">570</num> feet in width. The <num value="2">two</num> blocks south of them, King William's and Queen Mary's Buildings, are brought nearer to each other by the width of the colonnades; and the cupolas at the inner angles form a fine central feature, and impart unity to the general composition.   The view from the north gate, in the centre of the terrace, is very striking. Beyond the square are seen the hall and chapel, with their finely-proportioned cupolas and gilt vanes, and the <num value="2">two</num> colonnades, which form a kind of avenue terminated by the Royal Naval School, above which, on an eminence in the park, appears the Royal Observatory. 
   <P>In the centre of the great square is a statue of George III. It was the gift of Admiral Sir John Jennings, who was governor of the hospital in the reign of that king.   It was sculptured by Rysbrach, out of a single block of white marble, which weighed <num value="11">eleven</num> tons, and had been captured from the French by Sir George Rooke. 
   <P>At each extremity of the terrace in front of the hospital is a small pavilion; their use, however, is not very apparent, they were erected in <datestruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct>, and named respectively after King George III. and Queen Charlotte, but it is not on record that their majesties ever used them for tea-parties or other purposes.   On the terrace, in front of the gates, is a granite obelisk, erected as <QUOTE>a memorial of the gallant young Frenchman, Joseph Ren&eacute; Bellot, who perished in the search for Sir John Franklin, <datestruct VALUE="1853-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1853">1853</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> In the north-west corner of the grounds, in front of the <QUOTE>Ship</QUOTE> hotel, is another obelisk, put up in memory of several officers who fell during the Indian Mutiny. 
   <P>King Charles's Building is on the west side of the great square. The eastern portion formed the unfinished palace of Charles II.; it is built about an inner quadrangle, and is constructed of Portland <pb id="P.179" n="179"> stone. In the centre is a portico of the Corinthian order, crowned with an entablature and pediment; and in the pediment is a piece of sculpture, consisting of <num value="2">two</num> figures, <num value="1">one</num> representing Fortitude, and the other the Dominion of the Sea. At each end is a pavilion formed by <num value="4">four</num> pilasters of the Corinthian order, and surmounted by an attic. The <num value="4">four</num> fronts of this block of buildings nearly correspond with each other. In the pediment on the eastern side is a piece of sculpture representing Mars and Fame. Some part of this block having become very much decayed, it was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>. Richardson, in his <QUOTE>History of Greenwich,</QUOTE> states that Admiral George Byng was <QUOTE>confined in that quarter of Greenwich Hospital known as King Charles's Building, in the year <datestruct value="1756"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>, previous to his execution at Portsmouth in <datestruct value="1757--"><year reg="1757">1757</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> He also adds, <QUOTE>The individual to whom the author is indebted for his information waited on the admiral in the capacity of servant to the Marshal of the Admiralty, in whose custody the admiral then was, and, accompanying his master and the prisoner to Portsmouth, it eventually fell to his lot to place the cushion for the admiral to kneel upon when he was shot.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Queen Anne's Building, the corresponding block facing the river, was commenced in <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>, and was so named on the accession of Anne to the throne. It resembles King Charles's Building, except that the pediments are without sculpture.  This building now serves as the Naval Museum, of which we shall have more to say presently. 
    <P>To the south of Queen Anne's Building is another block, named after Queen Mary, the north side of which forms the chapel.   The lofty cupola at the western extremity of the chapel serves as the vestibule, in which are statues of Faith, Hope,  Meekness, and Charity, from designs by Benjamin  West. From this vestibule a flight of steps leads into the chapel, through folding doors of mahogany, highly enriched and carved.   The original chapel being destroyed by fire in <datestruct VALUE="1779-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1779">1779</year></datestruct>, the present structure was erected in its place, from the designs of James Stuart ( <QUOTE>Athenian Stuart</QUOTE> ), and was opened for service in <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>.   The chapel is upwards of <num value="100">100</num> feet long, and more than <num value="50">50</num> feet wide. The nave, and space round the communiontable and organ-gallery, is paved with black and white marble, and in the centre of the nave is the representation of an anchor and a seaman's compass. The ceiling is divided into compartments, ornamented with foliage and other designs in the antique style. The whole interior of the chapel is richly decorated with coloured marbles, scagliola, and fancy woods, sculpture, carving, and painting.   Entrance   to the   chapel is gained through an elaborately-sculptured marble screen with a frieze, by Bacon; and at each end of the chapel are <num value="4">four</num> marble columns of the Corinthian order, supporting the roof. In recesses above the gallery door,   &amp;c., are figures of prophets and evangelists, by   Benjamin West; whilst over the communion-table is a large painting, also by West, representing the <QUOTE>Preservation of St. Paul from Shipwreck on the   Island of Melita.</QUOTE> 
    <P>King William's Building, at the south-west side, like the corresponding block, has massive Doric columns, and comprises the <LEMMA id="lemma.179.1">great, or Painted Hall</LEMMA>, the dining-hall of the original institution, with its vestibule and cupola.   This part of the hospital was so far completed by the commencement of the year <datestruct value="1705"><year reg="1705">1705</year></datestruct>, as to be capable of receiving <num value="42">forty-two</num> seamen. <num value="3">Three</num> years later there were <num value="300">300</num> pensioners within the walls. The colonnades to King  William's and Queen Mary's Buildings are each  <num value="347">347</num> feet long, with returns of <num value="70">seventy</num> feet.   Each contains <num value="300">300</num> coupled Doric columns <num value="20">twenty</num> feet high. 
    <P>That portion of the structure of which Evelyn laid the foundation was completed in <num value="2">two</num> years, the architect being Sir Christopher Wren, who, it is said, generously undertook the work of that post without any emolument, his labours being equivalent to a large subscription.   In <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>, Sir  Christopher Wren submitted to the committee a plan for a large dining-hall (now the Painted Hall), which being approved of by them, the necessary portion of ground was immediately laid out, and the work prosecuted with such diligence, that the whole was roofed in and the dome erected by  <datestruct VALUE="1703-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct>, forming what is now called <QUOTE>King  William's Building.</QUOTE> The hall, originally intended as the hospital refectory, now serves as the gallery of naval pictures.   It is upwards of ioo feet in length, by <num value="50">fifty</num> feet in width, and about the same in height.   It is sufficiently well lighted for the purpose for which it was originally designed, but hardly so for a picture-gallery.   It is entered by a noble vestibule, open to <num value="1">one</num> of the lofty cupolas, from which it receives a very dim and shadowy light. A short flight of steps leads up into the hall, the ceiling of which at once rivets the attention of the visitor. This was painted by Sir James Thornhill, and is divided into compartments.   Its praises were <num value="1">first</num> sounded by Sir Richard Steele, who, in his play of <title>The Lover</title>, has given an admirable description of it.   In the central compartment appear King William and Queen Mary, surrounded by allegorical personages, intended to typify national prosperity, and the compartments are filled with <pb id="P.180" n="180"> figures representing the Seasons, the Elements, the Zodiac, with portraits of Copernicus, Newton, &amp;c.; emblems of science and naval trophies.   Every <num value="1">one</num> remembers the marvellous story of Sir James Thornhill stepping back to see the effect of his painting upon the ceiling, and being prevented from falling to the floor by some person defacing a portion of his work, thus causing the painter to rush forward and save himself from death. 
    <P>The painting of this hall occupied Sir James  Thornhill <num value="19">nineteen</num> years, from <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1727--"><year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct>; and he was paid at the rate of <measure value="3l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3">3</num></measure> a square yard for the ceiling, and <measure value="1l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1">1</num></measure> a yard for the walls. On the latter are fluted Corinthian pilasters, trophies, &amp;c.  Beyond the great hall is a raised apartment, called the <QUOTE>upper hall.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The great hall, as we have said, was at <num value="1">first</num> intended to be used as the common refectory of the institution, the upper chamber being appropriated to the table of the officers, and the lower to those of the pensioners. But when the growing revenue of the Hospital gradually led to an increase of the 
<FIGURE id="Fig.180" n="2000.14.0065"><HEAD>Greenwich Hospital, From The River.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 number of its inmates, the space proved inadequate to their accommodation; the table of the officers was discontinued, and other dining-halls for the men were provided on the basement storey.   The noble apartment had been thus unoccupied nearly a century, when, in <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, the Lieutenant-Governor, Mr. Locker, suggested its appropriation to the service of a National Gallery of Marine Paintings, to commemorate the eminent services of the Royal Navy of England.   This tasteful design was not then   executed; but in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct> it was again proposed by Governor Locker's son, who, with the consent of the then commissioners and governor, began the collection of the various paintings. The plan was warmly patronised by George IV., who promptly and liberally gave directions that the extensive and valuable series of portraits of the celebrated admirals of the reigns of Charles II. and William III. at Windsor Castle and Hampton Court should be transferred hither; and the king subsequently presented several other valuable and appropriate paintings from his private collection at <pb id="P.181" n="181"> St. James's Palace and Carlton House. Thus was formed the nucleus of <QUOTE>The Naval Gallery.</QUOTE> The example thus set by royalty was promptly followed by gifts of pictures from many noble and other liberal benefactors; and thus, in the course of a few years, the walls of the Painted Hall were adorned with portraits of our celebrated naval commanders, and representations of their actions. To these, <num value="5">five</num> other valuable pictures were added by King William   IV., in the year <datestruct value="1835"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct>.   The collection removed hither from Hampton Court included Sir Godfrey Kneller's series of portraits known as <QUOTE>Queen Anne's Admirals,</QUOTE> a series of some little value to the student of costume, as showing all the modifications of the flowing wig which marked the era of the later Stuarts. Besides the portraits of most of the celebrated 
<FIGURE id="Fig.181" n="2000.14.0066"><HEAD>The Painted Hall, Greenwich Hospital.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 naval heroes who have arisen in our isle since we became <QUOTE>super-eminent as a sea-faring and a sea-conquering people,</QUOTE> beginning with Raleigh, Willoughby, Hawkins, and Drake, there are here large numbers of naval pictures of great interest, such as the Defeat of the Spanish Armada, the Battle of Barfleur, Duncan's Victory at Camperdown, Nelson's Victory of the Nile, the Battle of Trafalgar, &amp;c. The <QUOTE>upper hall</QUOTE> is painted in a style to correspond with the great hall, but here the walls, as well as the ceiling, are covered. The ceiling exhibits Queen Anne and her consort, Prince George of Denmark; other figures personify the <num value="4">four</num> quarters of the globe; and on the walls below are represented, on <num value="1">one</num> side, the landing of William III. at Torbay in <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>, on the other the arrival of George I. at Greenwich.   The central <pb id="P.182" n="182"> wall, facing the entrance, presents a group of portraits of King George I. and <num value="2">two</num>. generations of his family. The dome of St. Paul's, then newly erected, appears in the background, amidst a cloud of tutelary virtues; and in front is to be seen Sir James Thornhill, the painter. The models of old men-of-war, the Franklin relics, and other objects formerly exhibited here, are now removed to the Naval Museum, which we shall presently notice. <num value="1">One</num> object, however, which was formerly shown here, has altogether disappeared. This was the funeral car in which the body of Nelson was conveyed, <QUOTE>with all the pomp befitting the gratitude of a great nation to the illustrious dead,</QUOTE> to St. Paul's Cathedral. <QUOTE>Of all the pageantry that Greenwich has witnessed since it became a town,</QUOTE> writes Charles Mackay, in his <QUOTE>Thames and its Tributaries,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>this was, if not the most magnificent, the most grand and impressive.   The body, after lying in state for <num value="3">three</num> days in the hospital, during which it was visited by immense multitudes, was conveyed, on the <datestruct VALUE="1806-01-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, up the river to Whitehall, followed in procession by the City Companies in their state barges.   The flags of all the vessels in the river were lowered half-mast high, in token of mourning, and solemn minuteguns were fired during the whole time of the procession. The body lay all that night at the Admiralty, and on the following morning was removed on a magnificent car, surmounted by plumes of feathers and decorated with heraldic insignia, to its final resting-place in St. Paul's Cathedral.   From the Admiralty to St. Paul's the streets were all lined with the military.   The procession was headed by detachments of the Dragoon Guards, the Scots Greys, and the <num value="92">92nd</num> Highlanders, with the Duke of York and his staff, the band playing that sublime funeral strain, the  <Q>Dead March in Saul.</Q>  Then followed the pensioners of Greenwich Hospital and the seamen of Lord Nelson's ship, the <hi rend=italics>Victory</hi>, a deputation from the Common Council of London, and a long train of mourning coaches, including those of the royal family, the chief officers of state, and all the principal nobility of the kingdom.   When the coffin, covered with the flag of the <hi rend=italics>Victory</hi>, was about to be lowered into the grave, an affecting incident occurred: the attendant sailors who had borne the pall rushed forward, and seizing upon the flag, before a voice could be raised to prevent them, rent it into shreds, in the intensity of their feelings, that each might preserve a shred as a memento   of the departed.</QUOTE> The car and   its trappings gradually decayed, and becoming wormeaten and past repair, were broken up. 
    <P>A   small apartment adjoining the upper hall, called the Nelson Room, contains an admirable portrait of Nelson, painted by Abbot, and also some half-dozen pictures illustrative of events in the great admiral's life, together with Benjamin  West's strange admixture of realism and allegory, called the Apotheosis of Nelson. 
    <P> <QUOTE>When we consider the entire dependence of every great work of this class on the caprice of successive rulers,</QUOTE> writes the author of <QUOTE>Bohn's  Pictorial Handbook of London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>we shall think it much more remarkable that every royal family, except that of England, should have been able to begin and finish a palace (and in some cases more than <num value="1">one</num>), than that English sovereigns should have not yet achieved such a work. Greenwich is the attempt that most nearly reached realisation; and, as when it is seen from the river the patchwork is mostly out of sight, the group becomes the most complete architectural scene we possess. The <num value="2">two</num> northern masses of building are from a design of  Jones; though the <num value="1">first</num> was not erected till after his death, by his pupil and son-in-law Webb; and the other not till Queen Anne's reign, after whom it is named. The older (or King Charles's) building was partly rebuilt in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>-<num value="14">14</num>, and distinguished by sculpture of artificial stone in the pediment.  The southern masses are chiefly from a design of  Sir Christopher Wren, and were commenced by  William and Mary, whose names they bear; but their construction proceeding slowly, successive periods have left the melancholy marks of steadily declining taste and increasing parsimony; that which begins in Portland stone and Corinthian splendour sinking at length into mean brickwork, or unable to afford in inferior stone the most ordinary degree of finish. The design of the brick portions is in the most corrupt taste of Vanbrugh, but whatever is visible from   the centre of the group is by Jones or Wren. The inferiority of the latter is obvious in the comparative want of repose, and greater crowding and flutter of small and multiplied parts. The <num value="2">two</num> pyramidising masses crowned by domes are finely placed, and quite characteristic of his style, as is also the coupling of columns in the colonnades. There is nothing so majestic as either the inward or river elevations cf  Jones's work, but more picturesqueness and variety.  The <num value="2">two</num> not only show the distinction between the tastes of these masters, but also exemplify, in some measure, that between the Roman and Venetian schools of modern   architecture; the. northern buildings having some resemblance to the former, though, in general, both our great architects were followers of the latter.</QUOTE> <pb id="P.183" n="183"> 
   <P>Such, then, is the general appearance of Greenwich Hospital, an edifice which, as stated in an earlier chapter, was considered by Peter the Great more fitted to be the abode of royalty than that of worn-out seamen.   Samuel Rogers, in his poem, the <title>Pleasures of Memory</title>, thus speaks of the institution : 
   <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Hail! noblest structure, imaged in the wave, 
     <L>A nation's grateful tribute to the brave; 
     <L>Hail! blest retreat from war and shipwreck, hail! 
     <L>That oft arrest the wondering stranger's sail. 
     <L>Long have ye heard the narratives of age, 
     <L>The battle's havoc, and the tempest's rage; 
     <L>Long have ye known Reflection's genial ray, 
     <L>Gild the calm close of Valour's various day. 
     <L>Time's sombrous touches soon correct the piece, 
     <L>Mellow each tint, and bid each discord cease; 
     <L>A softer tone of light pervades the whole, 
     <L>And steals a pensive languor o&lsquo;er the soul.</QUOTE>
 
   <P>The idea here shadowed forth may be a little exaggerated, and <QUOTE>discord</QUOTE> may, perhaps, not have wholly <QUOTE>ceased</QUOTE> within the walls of the hospital to the extent pictured by the poet--at all events, whilst the old pensioners occupied its apartments; but still these lines give expression to a truth which has been felt and acknowledged by hundreds and thousands of visitors both before and since they were penned. 
   <P>The hospital, as we have seen, was <num value="1">first</num> opened as an asylum in <datestruct value="1705--"><year reg="1705">1705</year></datestruct>, when <num value="42">forty-two</num> disabled seamen were admitted. In <datestruct value="1738--"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct> the number of pensioners had increased to <num value="1000">1,000</num>, which had become doubled in the course of the next <num value="40">forty</num> years. The number was subsequently increased to about <num value="3000">3,000</num>, independently of about <num value="32000">32,000</num> out-pensioners.

    <P>By Queen Anne's Commission, dated <datestruct VALUE="1703-07-21"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=21>21st</day>,  <year reg=1703>1703</year></datestruct>, there were appointed <num value="7">seven</num> commissioners, who were to form a general court; the Lord High  Admiral, the Lord Treasurer, or any <num value="2">two</num> privy councillors, to form a quorum; the governor and treasurer were appointed by the Crown, and all the other necessary officers by the Lord High  Admiral, on the recommendation of the general court. The same commission appointed twentyfive directors, called the <QUOTE>standing committee,</QUOTE> who met once every fortnight, and vested the internal government in the governor and a council of officers who were appointed by the Lord High  Admiral. By a charter, granted by George III., the commissioners became a body corporate, with full power to finish the building, to provide for seamen either within or without the hospital, to make bye-laws, &amp;c.; and this charter was followed by an Act of Parliament, which vested in the commissioners, thus incorporated, all the estates held in trust for the benefit of the hospital. By an Act passed in <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>for the better management of the affairs of Greenwich Hospital,</QUOTE> this corporation of commissioners and governors was dissolved, and <num value="5">five</num> commissioners appointed in their stead, and in them the estates and property df the hospital--amounting, from   the various sources mentioned above, to nearly     <measure value="170000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="170000">170,000</num></measure> annually--was vested. These commissioners were generally members of Parliament who had served in the inferior offices of the ministry, ex-lords of the Treasury, Admiralty, &amp;c. Complaints of great want of economy in the employment of this large revenue, the evidently increasing disinclination of seamen to enter the hospital as in-patients, and a doubt whether the institution was adapted to the existing social condition of the class which it was intended to benefit, led, ultimately, to a Commission of Enquiry, on whose recommendation, in <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>, an Act of Parliament was passed, by which improved arrangements were made as to the out-pensioners, and advantageous terms were offered to such inmates of the hospital as were willing to retire from it, with a view of closing it as an almshouse. 
    <P>Out of <num value="1400">1,400</num> in-pensioners then in the hospital, nearly a <num value="1000">thousand</num> at once elected to leave. A <num value="2">second</num> act, passed in <datestruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct>, effected a final clearance; and in the following year Greenwich Hospital ceased to be an asylum for seamen, though the last-mentioned act provides that in case of war the building shall be at all times available for its original purpose. On the departure of the old veteran seamen, for whom   this great work was erected, Greenwich lost many of its distinctive and most glorious associations.   The change was a severe <num value="1">one</num> for many of the old men, and it is said that more than half the number died within a very short time of vacating their old quarters. It seems, however, to have been the opinion of many who knew the old pensioners and the present race of <QUOTE>salts,</QUOTE> that the new arrangement-by which they receive their pensions in money, and live where and as they please with their relatives or friendsis better for them mentally as well as physically, and is more acceptable to the present generation of sailors. 
   <P>It was a pleasing sight, on a fine day, to see the old pensioners standing about in groups, or taking a solitary walk in the courts of the Hospital, or intent upon some newspaper, or perchance a book of adventures by sea, which recalled to them the experiences of early life. In the beautiful park hard by they appeared to find much gratification in rambling; and many of them would establish themselves on some green knoll, provided with a telescope, the wonders of which they would exhibit to strangers, and point out, with all the talkativeness of age, the remarkable objects which might be seen on every side. The appearance of these veterans--some without a leg or arm, others hobbling from the infirmities of wounds, or of years, and all clothed in old-fashioned blue coats and breeches, with cocked hats-would oddly contrast with the splendour of the building which they inhabited, did not the recollection that these men were amongst the noblest defenders of their country give a dignity to the objects which everywhere presented themselves, and make the crutch of the veteran to harmonise with the grandeur of the fabric in which he found his final port after the storms of a life of enterprise and danger. 
   <P>The habitations of the pensioners were divided into wards, each bearing a name which had been, or might be, appropriated to a ship. These wards consisted of large and airy rooms, on either side of <pb id="P.185" n="185"> which there were little cabins, in which each man had his bed. Every cabin had some convenience or ornament, the exclusive possession of its tenant; and these little appendages might have led <num value="1">one</num> to speculate upon the character of the man to whom   they belonged.   In <num value="1">one</num> might be seen a ballad and a ludicrous print; in another a Christmas carol and a Bible. In large communities, and particularly in a collegiate life, men must greatly subdue their personal habits and feelings into harmony with the general character of their society; but the individuality of the human mind will still predominate, displaying itself in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> little particulars, each of which would furnish to the accurate inquirer an increased knowledge of the human heart. The pensioners messed in common, and they assembled on Sundays for their devotions in the chapel of the Hospital. Now that the aged veterans have departed, we may well exclaim in the words of the poet:-- 
                             <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L part=f>The race of yore 
        <L>Who danced our infancy upon their knee, 
        <L>And told our marvelling boyhood legends store 
        <L>Of their strange &lsquo;ventures happ'd by land or sea, 
        <L>How are they blotted from the things that be! </QUOTE>

    <P>After the pensioners left their old home, the  Hospital remained closed and unoccupied for some short time, but it was eventually decided to make it the seat of a Royal Naval College. With this view, the interior of King Charles's Building was remodelled and converted into class-rooms for the naval students; the rooms in Queen Mary's  Building were renovated and fitted up as dormitories and as general and mess rooms for the engineer officers and students, whilst the Hospital  Chapel in this block became the College Chapel.  It was also proposed that the Painted Hall should become the college dining-hall, but this intention was ultimately abandoned. The rest of the building was remodelled so as to provide a lecture theatre and comfortable mess-rooms. 
   <P>The college was opened in <datestruct VALUE="1873-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct>, having been organised, to use the words of the Order in Council which sanctioned its foundation, <QUOTE>for the purpose of providing for the education of naval officers of all ranks above that of midshipmen in all branches of theoretical and scientific study bearing upon their profession.</QUOTE> The money necessary for the establishment of the new college upon an adequate scale was willingly voted by Parliament, and the votes for its subsequent maintenance, although amounting to a comparatively large sum, have been likewise passed, year by year, without a question, so that nothing has hindered the Admiralty from carrying out its intentions of giving to the executive officers of the Navy generally every possible advantage in respect of scientific education.      The   college   receives as students naval officers of all grades, from captains and commanders, to sub-lieutenants, as also officers of the Royal Marine Artillery, Royal Marine Light Infantry, and Naval Engineers, and also a limited number of apprentices selected annually by competitive examinations from the Royal Dockyards. By special permission, officers of the mercantile marine, and private students of naval architecture and marine engineering, are admitted to the college classes; but they must reside outside the precincts of the Hospital.   At the head of the college is a flag officer as president, who is assisted by a naval captain in matters affecting discipline; and by a Director of Studies, who is charged with the organisation and superintendence of the whole system of instruction and the various courses of study.   For the carrying out of a complete system of scientific and practical instruction, there is a large staff of professors, lecturers, and teachers. In the <num value="1">first</num> annual report on the Royal Naval College which was presented to both Houses of Parliament, the president stated that <QUOTE>the results of the year show that the standard of examination is so adjusted as to enable officers of good abilities, who on entering the navy dilligently apply themselves to studying their profession, to obtain their lieutenant's commission; while, on the other hand, it affords to those who are backward and ignorant on joining the college an opportunity of retrieving lost time and of maintaining their place in the navy if they earnestly avail themselves throughout the whole period of study of the means afforded them at the college.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Queen Anne's Building, as we have stated above, has been fitted up as a naval museum, primarily for the use of the college, but open also to the inspection of the public, except on Fridays and Sundays.   It contains the models of ancient and modern ships formerly exhibited at South Kensington, and a great variety of other objects of maritime interest brought from that institution, from the Painted Hall, from   Woolwich, Portsmouth, and different naval stations both at home and abroad. It presents, in fact, a complete epitome of naval history, and   a most instructive and valuable series of illustrations of the progress and development of naval architecture and engineering. The museum occupies <num value="17">seventeen</num> rooms, and they still retain   the respective   names which   were bestowed upon them after the ships in which their pugnacious old occupants had won their victoriessuch, for instance, as the <QUOTE>iHowe,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Windsor <pb id="P.186" n="186"> Castle,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Victory,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Vanguard,</QUOTE> and so on. Space will not admit of our giving more than a hurried glance at the very interesting collection of objects here brought together. In the east wing are placed models showing the construction of dockyards, docks, plans for hauling up and docking ships, classification of masts, yards, &amp;c.; lifeboats, rafts, lowering apparatus for saving life at sea, models of engines and machinery, &amp;c. In the west wing, the models of line-of-battle ships are very interesting, even to those who cannot boast of any knowledge of naval matters. The series begins with the well-known <hi rend=italics>Great Harry</hi>, which was built in <datestruct value="1513--"><year reg="1513">1513</year></datestruct> to replace <num value="1">one</num> destroyed by the French a year or <num value="2">two</num> previously; and from this comparatively primitive craft-which, however, could boast of 
<FIGURE id="Fig.186" n="2000.14.0068"><HEAD>Group Of Greenwich Pensioners.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 carrying <num value="122">122</num> guns, <num value="13">thirteen</num> of which were ninepounders!-the models present various intermediate stages of development until we arrive at the modern iron-clad and turret-ship. The complete revolution which has taken place in all fighting-ships, and the rapidity with which it has been brought about, are very strikingly shown here. Models which only a few years ago represented the utmost achievements of our naval architects and engineers, look now to be a very trivial advance upon the <hi rend=italics>Great Harry</hi>.      In an adjoining room are models of ships' ventilating   arrangements, screws, paddles, windlasses, anchors, and so forth; besides which there is an imposing array of missiles and explosives of various kinds.   The shells of various sizes and forms, exhibited in longitudinal <pb id="P.187" n="187"> sections, afford at a glance a great deal of information on the internal nature of these deadly messengers; then there are some diabolical-looking machines in the form of torpedoes and submarine mines. In a small room dividing the <QUOTE>Victory</QUOTE> from the <QUOTE>Vanguard</QUOTE> are deposited the interesting collection of relics of Sir John Franklin and his party, which the Lords of the Admiralty presented to Greenwich Hospital many years ago, and which had hitherto remained in the Painted Hall with the <QUOTE>Nelson relics,</QUOTE> which likewise have been removed here. The coat which Nelson wore at the battle of the Nile, when placed here with other relics by King William IV., was an object of attraction to thousands of modern relic-worshippers. It was given to the king by the Hon. Mrs. Damer, the well-known sculptor, to whom   it was given by Nelson, when he sat to her for his bust. The walls of this room are adorned with a valuable collection of sketches by Benjamin West, representing the rough designs for paintings and sculptures in the hospital chapel. The same apartment contains, on a pedestal, the famous old <QUOTE>astrolabe,</QUOTE> constructed forSirFrancis Drake's expedition to the West Indies, and presented to the hospital by the same king.

   <P>At a short distance westward of King William's Building is a large, substantial brick structure ol <num value="2">two</num> storeys, forming a closed square, which served as the infirmary for the old pensioners. It was built in the early part of the reign of George III., but was partly destroyed in the fire of <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>. When the buildings above described were appropriated for the purposes of a Naval College, this infirmary was assigned by the Government to that excellent institution, the Seamen's Hospital Society, whose hospital ship, the <hi rend=italics>Dreadnought</hi>, moored off Greenwich, was for years so familiar to all passengers on the Thames. The infirmary was opened in <datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>, as a <QUOTE>Free Hospital for Seamen of All Nations.</QUOTE> It contains in all upwards of <num value="60">sixty</num> rooms, together with a chapel, library, museum, surgery, dispensary, and apartments for the medical staff and their assistants. The building, which appears to be well adapted to its purpose, can provide space for <num value="300">300</num> beds; between <num value="2000">2,000</num> and <num value="3000">3,000</num> patients are received here annually. The Seamen's Hospital Society dates from the year <datestruct value="1821"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>, when their floating asylum was originally established on board the <hi rend=italics>Grampus</hi>, a <num value="50">50</num>-gun ship, which had been granted for the purpose by the Board of Admiralty. <pb id="P.188" n="188"> It claims particular attention on account of its great usefulness, being exclusively appropriated to the relief of a class of men who had till that time been entirely destitute of a hospital suited to their peculiar habits, being the only establishment for the reception of sick seamen arriving from abroad, or to whom accidents may happen in the river. In <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>, the <hi rend=italics>Grampus</hi> being found incapable of furnishing sufficient accommodation, the <hi rend=italics>Dreadnought</hi>, a <num value="98">98</num>-gun ship, which had once captured a Spanish <num value="3">three</num>-decker in Trafalgar Bay, was granted by the Government, and to her the patients were transferred; but in <datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct> it was decided, on sanitary and other grounds, to discontinue the hospital afloat, and the <hi rend=italics>Dreadnought</hi> was abandoned, the occupants being removed on shore to the infirmary. Here are received the sick and disabled seamen of every nation, on presenting themselves, no recommendation being necessary; and here they are maintained, and, when necessary, clothed, until entirely convalescent. It is worthy of note that this excellent institution is supported mainly by voluntary contributions, and that no money is received from the Government towards the annual expenditure.   The Duke of Northumberland, in a letter to the <hi rend=italics>Times</hi> in <datestruct VALUE="1877-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>, thus presses the claim of the Seamen's Hospital on the support of the public: <QUOTE>The seaman, for whose benefit this institution was founded, has ever been recognised as having a special title to the succour and   sympathy of this nation, which owes its grandeur, nay, its existence, to his labour and sufferings in her cause.   To him no other introduction is needed than sickness, disease, or accident, without distinction   of colour, creed, or nation. This society affords a refuge, not only during actual illness, but until the sufferer has gained strength to resume his occupation; <num value="170000">170,000</num> patients have already received relief at its hands, and the annual admissions have increased with the increased accommodation consequent on the transfer to the society of the infirmary of Greenwich Hospital, a noble grant from the Imperial Government, conveying with it, as it were, a national recognition of its services. To maintain it in full efficiency a more liberal support on the part of the public is required, not only on account of the additional number of patients received, but of the extra expense which the general rise in prices has brought or the funds of the establishment.   An increase of the annual subscription-list from   its present amount of <measure value="2500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2500">2,500</num></measure> to <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure> is the only sound method of ensuring this object, donations only affording a casual and uncertain resource. I feel assured that the attention of the benevolent has only to be drawn to these facts to secure for the Seaman's Hospital Society all the help it requires to develop to the full the capabilities of an institution, national in its origin and cosmopolitan in the scope and range of the benefits it confers.</QUOTE> It may not be out of place to state here that Her Majesty the Queen contributes ioo guineas annually to the funds of this institution, annually expressing <QUOTE>her anxiety for the maintenance of so excellent a charity, which grants relief when most needed to seamen of all nations.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Close by this building are the western gates, the piers of which are crowned by <num value="2">two</num> large stone globes-<num value="1">one</num> the celestial and the other the terrestrial-each <num value="6">six</num> feet in diameter; on the former the meridians and circles, and on the latter the parallels of latitude and longitude are said to have been laid down, and the globes adjusted with great accuracy, by the authorities of the Observatory. 
   <P>The Queen's House, as the building on the south side of Greenwich Hospital was once called, now serves as the Royal Naval School, and thither we will now proceed. The building, which was commenced by Anne of Denmark, and finished by Henrietta Maria, forms the centre of the present range of buildings devoted to the purposes of the school, and immediately faces the central avenue of the hospital. It bears on the front the date <datestruct value="1635"><year reg="1635">1635</year></datestruct>, but it has been much altered since then. The wings are united to the central building by a colonnade <num value="180">180</num> feet long. The Queen's House, after being long used as the ranger's lodge, when it was known as Pelham   House, was, in <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, appropriated to the use of the Royal Naval Asylum, which had been originally established at Paddington. The Royal Naval Schools, although cut off from the actual precincts of Greenwich Hospital, in spite of many internal changes, are among the earliest foundations in connection with it. In the original charter it was provided that out of the funds provision was to be made for <QUOTE>the maintenance and education of the children of seamen happening to be slain or disabled in the service of the royal navy.</QUOTE> In pursuance of this provision a school was founded at Greenwich in <datestruct value="1712--"><year reg="1712">1712</year></datestruct>, for boys and girls, the qualification being that they were the children of <QUOTE>pensioners or other poor seamen.</QUOTE> At <num value="1">first</num> the number of boys was only <num value="10">ten</num>; but, with a gradual increase in the revenue of the hospital, this number was increased to <num value="200">200</num> in the year <datestruct value="1803"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct> the Royal Naval Asylum, which at that time educated <num value="680">680</num> boys and <num value="200">200</num> girls, was incorporated with these schools. After some other changes, the Greenwich schools were open to receive the sons of officers, and they <pb id="P.189" n="189"> 
<!--illustration on unnumbered page facing page <num value="189">189</num>-->

<FIGURE id="Fig.189" n="2000.14.0069"><HEAD>Greenwich Hospital, From The River.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 supplied an education by no means contemplated either in character or cost by the original act. An investigation made by a committee in <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct> discovered not only that the schools were being improperly administered, but that boys were entered who were totally unfit for sea life; and in nearly every conceivable respect they found the intentions of the founders of these schools had been compromised. They recommended, therefore, a radical alteration in their organisation, they re-imposed the old conditions of entry, and insisted on a preparation for sea life being considered an indispensable condition of entry.   Under this revision, which was speedily carried out, the schools became, as was intended, a sort of nursery for the navy. The boys, under this system, are now entered at <num value="10">ten</num> years of age; and if, at the age of <num value="13">thirteen</num>, they are unwilling or unable to enter the navy, they are compelled to leave the school, and make way for boys who are fit for naval service. The number of boys under instruction is nearly <num value="1000">1,000</num>, and besides the ordinary rudiments of education   they are taught seamanship as well as it possibly can be taught on shore, and they are also trained to all kinds of industrial occupations, such as cooking, bread-making, tailoring, washing (the heavy work being done by labour-saving machinery), ironing, carpentering, and other like work--the whole of the clothes for the school being made on the spot, the repairs of the building done by the inmates, and the food cooked, the boys doing the greater part of the labour. 
   <P>In connection with the Royal Naval School there is a spacious swimming-bath, where all the boys are taught to swim; there is also a capacious gymnasium; and last, not least, a full-rigged model ship, a corvette, on the lawn in front of the principal building, in which the juvenile crew are taught the <QUOTE>duties of men of the sea.</QUOTE> In the year <datestruct value="1877"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct> it was announced that the Admiralty proposed to make an important alteration in the school, requiring henceforth that the boys who entered it should give a guarantee that, if judged to be physically fit, they would enter Her Majesty's navy at the conclusion of their training. 
   <P>The administration of the affairs of Greenwich Hospital, down to the time of its <QUOTE>disestablishment</QUOTE> as such, were, as we have stated above, in the hands of a Board of Commissioners, appointed under royal charter. The principal officers were a governor, lieutenant-governor, <num value="4">four</num> captains, <num value="8">eight</num> lieutenants, a treasurer, a secretary, an auditor, a surveyor, a clerk of the works, a clerk of the cheque, <num value="2">two</num> chaplains, a physician, a surgeon, a steward, and various other assistants. 
   <P>It would, of course, be impossible for us in these pages to speak of all the distinguished men who have taken part in these different offices; but we may be pardoned for mentioning <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num>. Among the former chaplains, then, was the Rev. Nicholas Tindal, the fellow-worker with Morant in the <QUOTE>History of Essex,</QUOTE> and also in the translation of Rapin's <QUOTE>History of England.</QUOTE> He died at an advanced age, and was buried in the new cemetery. Of Evelyn and his son-in-law, Draper, we have already spoken as acting as treasurers; another person who occupied that position was Mr. Swynfen Jervis, a solicitor, the father of a great naval commander, Lord St. Vincent, whose after-life, too, in a manner became interested in the affairs ox Greenwich Hospital. How Lord St. Vincent's early difficulties were overcome by native hardihood and determination, we learn from his own words. <QUOTE><num value="4">4</num> My father,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>had a very large family, with very limited means. He gave me at starting in life <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>, and that was all he ever gave me. After I had been a considerable time at the station [Jamaica] I drew for <num value="20">twenty</num> more, but the bill came back protested.   I was mortified at this rebuke, and made a promise, which I have ever kept, that I would never draw another bill without a certainty of its being paid. I immediately changed my mode of living; quitted my mess, lived alone, and took up the ship's allowance, which I found quite sufficient; washed and mended my old clothes; and made a pair of trousers out of the ticking of my bed; and having by these means saved as much money as redeemed my honour, I took up my bill, and from that time to this I have lived within my means.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Edward, <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Sandwich--the <QUOTE>My lord</QUOTE> of Pepys's <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> --in his official capacity as Lord High Admiral of England, took an active part in the administration of the affairs of Greenwich Hospital. As Sir Edward Montagu he had been distinguished as a military commander under the Parliamentarian banner in the civil war, and was subsequently joint High Admiral of England, in which capacity, having had sufficient influence to induce the whole fleet to acknowledge the restored monarchy, he was elevated to the peerage by Charles II. After the Restoration, he obtained the highest renown as a naval officer, and fell in the great sea-fight with the Dutch, off Southwold Bay, in <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>.   His great-grandson, John, the <num value="4">fourth</num> Earl of Sandwich, was likewise officially, and perhaps not very creditably, connected with Greenwich Hospital. This nobleman, an eminent diplomatist and statesman, assisted at the congress of Aix-la-Chapelle, in the year <datestruct value="1748"><year reg="1748">1748</year></datestruct>; he was <pb id="P.190" n="190"> subsequently Secretary of State, and <num value="1">first</num> Lord of the Admiralty. 
   <P>The appointment of Sir Hugh Palliser, in <datestruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct>, to the governorship of Greenwich Hospital, was the subject of a vote of censure on the ministry, proposed by no less a person than Charles James Fox.   The motion was negatived, and Palliser held the post till his death in <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>; but no <num value="1">First</num> Lord of the Admiralty ever ventured again to give him active employ at sea. 
   <P>It will be remembered by the readers of history that the affairs of this hospital gave Lord Erskine his <num value="1">first</num> start in that profession of which he rose to be so great a luminary. Having left the navy, and been called to the Bar, he was engaged in a prosecution for libel, which was in fact instituted by the <num value="1">First</num> Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Sandwich, who had abused the munificent institution which was under his official control by appointing landsmen as pensioners, in order to serve the electioneering purposes of his party. Such was the effect of Mr. Erskine's indignant speech in this case that the hitherto unknown advocate had <num value="30">thirty</num> retaining fees offered him   on the spot, and he may be said to have left the court with his fortune made. He ultimately became, as is well known, Lord Chancellor, in the ministry of <QUOTE>All the Talents,</QUOTE> and a peer of the realm. 
   <P>When the Act of Parliament above referred to came into operation, the offices of commissioners, governor, and lieutenant-governor were abolished, and the Admiralty had conferred upon them the power to dismiss any other officials it may think proper; but every such official would be allowed to receive an annuity for life equal in amount to the salaries and emoluments he then enjoyed, and he would also continue to receive any superannuation allowance he might at the time be in receipt of. The governor and lieutenant-governor were allowed to retain their titles and their residences in the hospital. 
   <P>The entire control of the hospital and institutions attached to it is now in the Admiralty, subject to the <hi rend=italics>veto</hi> of the council, and the expenses are, in the <num value="1">first</num> instance, paid out of money provided by Parliament for that purpose.   All the property belonging to the hospital is vested in the Admiralty under the same provisions as lands vested in the Board under the Admiralty Lands and Works Act of <datestruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct>, together with the <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure> paid annually out of the Consolidated Fund. 
   <P>In concluding this chapter, we may remark that before the <QUOTE>chest,</QUOTE> or fund for disabled seamen, was removed to Greenwich, in order to be better regulated, the pensioners, who resided at a distance from the spot, and whose appearance before the commissioners was only occasionally required, were accustomed to barter away their stipends to certain usurers, who made large fortunes at their expense. These were the speculators in <QUOTE>seamen's tickets,</QUOTE> of whom it is generally, though erroneously, supposed that Thomas Guy was a specimen.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="93">93</num>.</NOTE>

<P>Although Greenwich is <num value="4">four</num> miles distant from London either by road or rail, and <num value="5">five</num> miles from London Bridge by the river, it has, nevertheless, for these many years lost its separate existence, and been absorbed into the great metropolis, just as many larger places around London have been swallowed up before and since; and Greenwich, at the present moment, is almost as much a part of the great metropolis as St. John's Wood and Islington. 
   <P>Of the early history of the manor of Greenwich we have already spoken; the present local importance of the town, however, must be attributed to the establishment, firstly of the royal residence <pb id="P.191" n="191"> here, and ultimately of the Royal Hospital. It sent members to Parliament in the <num value="5">fifth</num> and <num value="6">sixth</num> years of Philip and Mary's reign, but discontinued to do so afterwards. This was the more strange on account of the affection with which the royal town of Greenwich was regarded by Queen Elizabeth. <num value="2">Two</num> centuries later, however, that honour was restored to it; for under the Reform Bill of <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct> Greenwich, conjointly with Deptford, Woolwich, Charlton, and   Plumstead, was created a Parliamentary borough, returning <num value="2">two</num> members to Parliament.   Among the distinguished men who have been returned as its representatives, we may mention Sir David Salomons, the <num value="1">first</num> member of the Jewish community who ever took his seat in the House of Commons; Admiral Sir Houston Stewart, some time Governor of Greenwich Hospital   General Sir William Codrington, Governor of Gibraltar, and head of the army in the Crimea; and last, not least, Mr. W. E. Gladstone, who took refuge here on his rejection by South Lancashire, in <datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the assizes for the county of Kent were held here on <num value="3">three</num> occasions. The town in itself has not much in the way of public buildings to be described in these pages.  Originally a small fishing village-like its neighbour, Deptford--the place has gone on increasing gradually to its present size; the streets, consequently, are somewhat irregular in plan and diversified in character, but possess no features either imposing or picturesque. At the commencement of the present century the number of inhabitants was <num value="14000">14,000</num>, which had swelled to <num value="40000">40,000</num> at the taking of the census in <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>Numerous improvements were made in the twon during the <num value="1">first</num> decade of the present century; these considerably altered its appearance.   Mr.  Richardson, in his work already referred to, published in <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, says that, <QUOTE>To show the rural character of the place to a very recent period, it may be mentioned that within the last <num value="20">twenty</num> years there were posts and rails to divide the footpath from the road on Croom's Hill, and that till the year <datestruct value="1813"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct> there were trees standing in the very centre of the town, nearly opposite the church.  London Street, the leading thoroughfare on entering the town from the metropolis, has also, within the last <num value="30">thirty</num> years, assumed a much altered appearance in its change of character from a street of private residences to <num value="1">one</num> of commerce, almost every house within it now presenting a shop frontage; whereas, at the period alluded to, the shops were very few in number, and almost wholly confined to that end nearest the centre of the town.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The parish church, dedicated to St. Alphege, stands in the centre of the town, at the junction of London Street, Church Street, and Stockwell Street. It is <num value="1">one</num> of the <QUOTE><num value="50">fifty</num> new churches</QUOTE> provided for by Act of Parliament in the reign of Queen Anne; and it occupies the site of the old parish church, the roof of which fell in and seriously damaged the rest of the fabric in <datestruct VALUE="1701-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>. A writer in the <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazinze</hi>, for <datestruct VALUE="1805-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, p. <num value="422">422</num>, after alluding to the pernicious consequences arising from the old practice of burying in churches, by which the pavement was defaced, and the windows filled up with monuments, remarks, <QUOTE>But, what is worse, I have known the whole building demolished, and thrown into a heap of rubbish, by the digging of a grave too near the foundation of a pillar, so that, being undermined, great hath been the fall thereof. Thus fell the ancient church of Greenwich a few years since, but, by the providence of Heaven, no person was therein.</QUOTE> In this church was a portrait, on glass, of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester; there were also several monuments and brasses to the distinguished worthies who were buried there, among whom   were Thomas Tallis, the great composer of church music, and musician in the royal chapels in the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Queens Mary and Elizabeth; he died in <datestruct value="1585--"><year reg="1585">1585</year></datestruct>, and a brass plate recording his burial here has been affixed in the present church; there also rest Robert Adams, architect (<datestruct value="1595--"><year reg="1595">1595</year></datestruct>); William Lambarde, the antiquary, and author of the <QUOTE>Perambulation of Kent</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1601--"><year reg="1601">1601</year></datestruct>); and Thomas Philipott, writer of the <QUOTE>Villare Cantianum</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct>). The monuments in the old church perished with the building, with the exception of that of Lambarde, which was rescued from   the wreck and removed to Sevenoaks Church.   In commemoration of St. Alphege was put up in the old church the following inscription- <QUOTE>This church was erected and dedicated to the glory of God, and the memory of Saint Alphege, Archbishop of Canterbury, here slain by the Danes.</QUOTE> Mention is made of the old parish church by our gossiping friends Evelyn and Pepys. The former, under date of <datestruct VALUE="1687-04-24"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=24>24</day>, <year reg=1687>1687</year></datestruct>, writes: <QUOTE>At Greenwich, at the conclusion of the church service, there was a French sermon preach'd after the use of the English Liturgy translated into French, to a congregation of about Too French refugees, of whom   Monsieur Ruvigny was the chiefe, and had obtain'd the use of the church after--the parish service was ended.</QUOTE> Unlike the excellent John Evelyn, Pepys occasionally notes in his <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> facts which do not raise our estimate of his morals or his religion; for instance, he writes: <QUOTE>By coach to Greenwich church, where a good <pb id="P.192" n="192"> sermon, a fine church, and a great company of handsome women.</QUOTE> 
   <P><LEMMA id="lemma.192.1">The present church</LEMMA> of St. Alphege was completed in <datestruct value="1718--"><year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct>, and consecrated by Bishop Atterbury. It is a thoroughly solid-looking edifice of Portland stone, and was built from the designs of John James, a local architect. The building is cruciform in plan, with a tower of <num value="3">three</num> stages, tapering to a spire, at the western end. In <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, during a violent thunderstorm, the spire of this church was struck by the electric fluid and shivered to pieces, but it has been replaced. The style of architecture is the Roman Doric of the period. The interior is spacious: it has a broad nave with aisles, shallow transepts, and a coved recess for the chancel.   Deep galleries extend along the <num value="2">two</num> sides, and across the western end, the latter containing the organ.   In <datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct> the old-fashioned square pews were converted into open sittings, and various other alterations were made. The galleries, pulpit, and fittings generally are of dark oak, highly carved and polished.   The columns are of the Corinthian order; and the decorations of the altarrecess are ascribed to Sir James Thornhill. 
   <P>Among the notable personages buried in the 
<FIGURE id="Fig.192" n="2000.14.0071"><HEAD>The Parish Church, Greenwich.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 new church were Admiral Lord Aylmer, Governor of Greenwich Hospital and Ranger of the Park, who died in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>; General Wolfe, the victor of Quebec (<datestruct value="1759--"><year reg="1759">1759</year></datestruct>); and Lavinia, Duchess of Bolton (famous as an actress for her impersonation of <QUOTE>Polly Peachum</QUOTE> ), who was interred here in <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>There were formerly hung upon the walls of this church portraits of Queen Elizabeth, Charles I., Queen Anne, and George I.; but becoming, by lapse of time, dingy and faded, they were stowed away as lumber in the organ-loft of the church, and ultimately sold by the churchwardens.   The portrait of Queen Anne went to the Painted Hall, in Greenwich Hospital, for the sum of <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure>, the permission of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty having been obtained to pay that sum for it. The portraits of Queen Elizabeth, Charles I., and George I. were sold to a general dealer living in New Cross for <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> <measure value="15s." type=currency><num value="15">15</num>s.</measure>, and were subsequently sold by him at a profit of <measure value="50s." type=currency><num value="50">50</num>s.</measure> to a picture-dealer in New Bond Street, by whom   they were restored. The portrait of King George represents the king in full coronation dress, the heavy ermine cloak being thrown back in front, revealing a rich close-fitting dress, while round the   shoulders is a massive <pb id="P.193" n="193"> chain, from which is suspended the prancing horse of Hanover.   On the table beside his Majesty are the crown and sceptre, the king's hand grasping the ball and cross.   In the background is a view of Westminster Abbey. The value of this picture is stated to be over <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>. The portrait of Charles I., <num value="10">ten</num> feet square, is supposed to be the work of Sir Peter Lely. The painting represents the king in a prayerful attitude, and is believed to be even more valuable than that of George I. All the monarchs mentioned were associated with Greenwich, but their portraits are now scattered. 
    <P>With reference to the manner in which these portraits came into the possession of the parish, a correspondent of the <hi rend=italics>Times</hi>, in <datestruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct>, wrote:-- <QUOTE>According to a list, taken in <datestruct value="1706--"><year reg="1706">1706</year></datestruct>,  <Q>the picture of Queen Elizabeth in a handsome black frame, with ornaments of gilding about it, was painted at the parish charge.</Q>   <Q> The picture of King Charles the Martyr, with a fair frame, fillited with gold, was the gift of Mrs. Mary Squib</Q>  (probably about <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>). The remaining portraits were doubtless bestowed on the parish by the Crown (the lords of the manor), or loyal parishioners. The antiquities of the church of St. Alphege have been very unfortunate. After 
<FIGURE id="Fig.193" n="2000.14.0072"><HEAD>The Duke Of Norfolk's Almhouses, In <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 the roof of the former structure fell in at midnight, <datestruct VALUE="1710-11-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct>, and the present church was erected, several monuments and all the stained glass in the windows containing armorial bearings, were missing; and upon inspecting the parish chest some years ago, the whole of the ancient charters and papal bulls relative to this church, known to have been there in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, were not to be found.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Queen Elizabeth, as we have already remarked, made the palace her favourite summer residence. Charles I. passed much of his time at the <QUOTE>House of Delight.</QUOTE> Queen Anne, as we have seen, built <num value="1">one</num> of the wings of the Hospital, which still bears her name; while George I. landed at Greenwich on his arrival from Hanover. 
   <P>Greenwich became <num value="1">one</num> of the head-quarters of the Huguenot refugees, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes; and in London Street was, in the reigns of James II. and William III., a chapel for their use.   It was erected by <num value="1">one</num> of their most distinguished members, the aged Marquis de Ruvigny, a person of learning, who had been ambassador at St. James's and at other courts, as well as Deputy of the Protestants of France in the Parliament at Paris, and who formed the centre of <pb id="P.194" n="194"> a large circle of his countrymen. Before their chapel was ready for use the Huguenots were allowed to use the parish church, at the end of the afternoon service, on Sundays. John Evelyn, in his 
<title>Diary</title>, as we have seen above, records the fact of his being present at this service, in <datestruct value="1687--"><year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct>. The little foreign colony is extinct, and the chapel is now occupied as a Nonconformist meeting-house. 
   <P>In Church Street is an inn bearing the very singular title of the <QUOTE>Spanish Galleon.</QUOTE> The sign owes its existence, in all probability, to the fact of its standing so near to the pictures of our naval victories in the Royal Hospital, in which captured Spanish galleons figure somewhat frequently. 
   <P>It may possibly be remembered by readers of Boswell that, when Dr. Johnson <num value="1">first</num> wrote to Edmund Cave, the proprietor and editor of the newly-founded <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi>, it was from <QUOTE>Greenwich, next door to the  <Q>Golden Heart,</Q>  in Church Street,</QUOTE> where he had taken apartments when he <num value="1">first</num> came from his native Lichfield to town, in order to write the parliamentary articles for the above-mentioned publication. 
   <P>The following list of Dr. Johnson's places of residence after he had entered the metropolis as an author is based on Boswell's Life :--Exeter Street, Strand; Greenwich; Woodstock Street, Hanover Square; No. <num value="6">6</num>, Castle Street, Cavendish Square; Strand; Boswell Court; Strand   again; Bow Street; Staple's Inn; Gray's Inn; No. <num value="1">1</num>, Inner Temple Lane; No. <num value="7">7</num>, Johnson's Court; and No. <num value="8">8</num>, Bolt Court. 
   <P>Greenwich appears to have been a favourite place with the old lexicographer; much of his tragedy of <hi rend=italics>Irene</hi> was written whilst he was living here; and, as Boswell tells us, it was partly composed beneath the spreading elms in Greenwich Park. Railways being at that time a mode of conveyance undreamed of, the river was Johnson's favourite highway between Greenwich and London. The following anecdote, told concerning an incident which took place on <num value="1">one</num> occasion when Boswell and Johnson were proceeding thither in a boat from the Temple, may bear repeating : 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Boswell asked Johnson if he really thought a knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages an essential requisite to a good education. <hi rend=italics>Johnson:</hi>
 <Q>Most certainly, sir; for those who know them have a very great advantage over those who do not. Nay, sir, it is wonderful what a difference learning makes upon people even in the common intercourse of life, which does not appear to be much connected with it.</Q>  <hi rend=italics>Boswell</hi>:  <Q>And yet people go through the world very well, and carry on the business of life to good advantage, without learning.</Q>    <hi rend=italics>Johnson</hi>:  <Q>Why, sir, that may be true in cases where learning cannot possibly be of any use; for instance, this boy rows us as well without learning, as if he could sing the song of Orpheus to the Argonauts, who were the <num value="1">first</num> sailors.</Q>  He then called to the boy,  <Q>What would you give, my lad, to know about the Argonauts?</Q>     <Q>Sir,</Q>  said the boy,  <Q>I would give what I have.</Q>  Johnson was much pleased with his answer, and we gave him a double fare.</QUOTE>

   <P>Other noted residents of Greenwich about this time were General Withers and Colonel Disney, convivial friends of Pope; the latter is mentioned in Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's letters as <QUOTE>Duke Disney.</QUOTE> They are thus jointly commemorated by Pope in his Panegyrics:-- 
   <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=stanza><L>Now pass we Gravesend with a friendly wind,

   <P>In   the Greenwich   Road, nearly opposite the railway station, stands Queen Elizabeth's College, founded by William   Lambarde, the historian of Kent, in <datestruct value="1576--"><year reg="1576">1576</year></datestruct>, for <num value="20">twenty</num> poor men and their wives.   It is said, and perhaps truly, to have been the <num value="1">first</num> public charity of the kind founded after the Reformation.   The almshouses were rebuilt early in the present century; each of the inmates has a separate tenement and garden, and   <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> a year in hard cash.   The endowment, which has been greatly augmented in value since Lambarde's time, is under the control of the Drapers' Company, who have of late built some additional houses, and made other improvements.   The founder, with the consent of the Bishop of Rochester, composed a form of morning and evening prayer, to be used in the college; and he made his endowment void, if it should ever become unlawful, by the statutes of the realm, to use it. 
   <P>The   Jubilee   Almshouses, in   this road, were founded by a subscription raised among the townspeople   in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, in   commemoration   of King George III. having, on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct> of that year, entered upon the fiftieth year of his reign. <pb id="P.195" n="195"> Additional almshouses have since been added on several public occasions; and there are now <num value="20">twenty</num> houses in all, and each of the occupants receives a small annuity. 
  <P>At the corner of Royal Hill are some commodious baths and wash-houses, near to which is a large lecture-hall and also a theatre; but with regard to these buildings nothing need be said further than that they meet their several requirements.   There was formerly a theatre in London Street, but it was destroyed by fire in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>. A few years later the proprietor, a Mr. Savill, constructed, on a novel principle, another theatre of iron, all the parts of which were put together with screws, so as to be capable of being taken to pieces, and conveyed to different towns. 
   <P>Eastward of Royal Hill, and skirting the western side of Greenwich Park, is Croom's Hill, a steep and winding thoroughfare leading fiom the town up to Blackheath.   A conspicuous object here is the lofty tower and spire of St. Mary's Roman  Catholic Church, which, with its external statue of  St. Mary, <QUOTE>star of the sea,</QUOTE> is built so as to strike the eye of mariners as they sail up the river. 
   <P>Near the bottom of Croom's Hill, close by the principal entrance to the park, stands the <LEMMA id="lemma.195.1"> <QUOTE>new church</QUOTE> of St. Mary</LEMMA>. It is a neat edifice of a semiclassic style of architecture, constructed of Suffolk brick and Bath stone, and the chief feature of the exterior is an Ionic portico at the western end, above which rises a tower of <num value="2">two</num> stages. The <QUOTE><num value="1">first</num> stone</QUOTE> of the structure was laid by the Princess Sophia in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, and the church was consecrated in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>.   Over the altar is a picture of <QUOTE>Christ Giving Sight to the Blind,</QUOTE> painted by Richter, and presented by the British Institution. 
   <P>From   this church a broad thoroughfare called  King Street leads direct to the pier, close by the  Ship Hotel; and on the west side of this street, is the Market-place, which has its principal entrance in Clarence Street, and another entrance in Nelson  Street, a broad well-built street so called after  England's great naval hero.   The market was erected by the Commissioners of the Royal Hospital near the site of a former market, and was opened in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>.   It contains spacious accommodation for vendors of meat, fish, vegetables, &amp;c., and the whole is surrounded by a block of good substantial houses, with shops.   The profits of the market being vested in Henry, Earl of Romneywhose name is still perpetuated in Romney Place --were given by him, in <datestruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct>, to the Royal Hospital, as stated in the preceding chapter. 
   <P>Like St. James's Park and Hampstead, Greenwich in former times could boast of its <QUOTE>Spring Gardens.</QUOTE> In the <hi rend=italics>General Advertiser</hi> for <datestruct VALUE="1771-05-25"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=25>25</day>, <year reg=1771>1771</year></datestruct>, occurs the following announcement : 
   <QUOTE REND=blockquote><TEXT><BODY><head rend=caps>Spring Gardens, Greenwich.--</HEAD><p>The Evening Entertainments at this place will begin this day, the <num value="25">25th</num> inst., with a good Band of Vocal and Instrumental Musick. To be continued on Saturday and Monday Evenings during the Summer Season. N.B.-The Grand Room in the garden is upwards of <num value="50">fifty</num> feet long.</TEXT></QUOTE>

   <P>These gardens, as a correspondent of <hi rend=italics>Notes and Queries</hi> tells us, were situate near Christ Church, in East Greenwich, and, for many years after they were closed as a place of amusement, were turned into garden ground, but, as is the fate of many such places in the vicinity of London, the site is now nearly built over. 
   <P>On account of the contiguity of this town to Deptford, it is frequently mentioned by Evelyn and likewise by Pepys in their amusing diaries. The former, writing in <datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>, makes this entry:-- <QUOTE>Came old Jerome Lennier, of Greenwich, a man skill'd in painting and musiq, and another rare musitian, called Mell. I went to see his collection of pictures, especially those of Julis Romano, which surely had been the king's, and an Egyptian figure, &amp;c.   There were also excellent things of Polydore, Guido, Raphael, Tintoret, &amp;c.   Lennier had been a domestic of Qu. Elizabeth's, and show'd me her head, an intaglia in a rare sardonyx, cut by a famous Italian, which he assur'd   me was exceedingly like her.</QUOTE> 
    <P>For the same reason, too, naturally enough, Greenwich became a depot for strange and foreign 
<hi rend=italics>curiosa</hi>; at all events, Evelyn informs us in his <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> that he came hither in <datestruct value="1657--"><year reg="1657">1657</year></datestruct> to see <QUOTE>a sort of catt, brought from the East Indies, shap'd and snouted much like the Egyptian racoon, in the body like a monkey, and so footed; the eares and taile like a catt, onely the taile much longer and the skin variously ringed with black   and white; with the taile it wound up its body like a serpent, and so got up into trees, and with it would wrap its whole body round.   Its haire,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>was woolly, like   a lamb's; it was exceedingly nimble and gentle, and purr'd as does the catt.</QUOTE> 
    <P>If we may believe the paragraph writers of the  London journals in <datestruct value="1683--"><year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>, this place has been often haunted   by other strange   monsters; as witness the following item extracted from their columns:-- <QUOTE>A perfect mermaid was, by the last great wind, driven ashore near Greenwich, with her comb in <num value="1">one</num> hand and her looking-glass in the other.   She seemed to be of the countenance of a most fair and beautiful woman, with her arms crossed, weeping out many pearly drops of salt <pb id="P.196" n="196"> tears; and afterwards she, gently turning hersel upon her back, swam away without being seer any more.</QUOTE> Probably the writer believed the sub stance of this paragraph, and only exercised his journalistic talent in decorating his fact with tender and romantic incidents. 
  <NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.196.1">John Howard, Duke of Norfolk</LEMMA></NOTE>

     <P>In or about <datestruct value="1749--"><year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct> there was exhibited at the <QUOTE>Rose and Crown,</QUOTE> near the gates of the park, a strange collection of wild beasts, from the catalogue of which we take the following items:-- <QUOTE><num value="1">1</num>. <hi rend=italics>A</hi>
large and beautiful young camel, from Grand Cairo, in Egypt, near <num value="8">eight</num> feet high, though not twoc years old, and drinks water but once in <num value="16">sixteen</num> days. <num value="2">2</num>. A surprising hyaena, from the Coast of   Guinea.   <num value="3">3</num>. A beautiful he panther, from Buenos   Ayres, in the Spanish West Indies.   <num value="4">4</num>. A young riobiscay, from Russia; and several other creatures too tedious to mention.   Likewise a travelling post-chaise, from Switzerland, which, without horses, keeps its stage for upwards of <num value="50">fifty</num> miles a day, without danger to the rider.   Attendance from <num value="8">eight</num> in the morning till <num value="8">eight</num> at night.</QUOTE> This list we take from Mr. Frost's <QUOTE>Old Showmen;</QUOTE> but what the <QUOTE>riobiscay</QUOTE> can have been is beyond our power to discover. 
    <P>At the eastern end of the town, fronting the  Thames, is a college for the maintenance of <num value="20">twenty</num> old and decayed housekeepers, <num value="12">twelve</num> of whom are to be chosen from Greenwich, and the rest alternately from <num value="2">two</num> parishes in Norfolk. It is called the Duke of Norfolk's College, though it was founded not by <num value="1">one</num> of the Dukes of Norfolk, but by his brother Henry, Earl of Northampton, who committed it to the care of the Mercers'  Company.   The earl's body rests in the chapel of the college, having been brought there from  Dover Castle about the year <datestruct value="1770"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>. The edifice, which is commonly styled Trinity Hospital, is situated at a short distance eastward of Greenwich  Hospital. It is a large quadrangular pile of brick buildings, with a tower. 
   <P>A stone let into the wall of the wharf, opposite the entrance to the college, bears upon it a line denoting a <QUOTE>remarkable   high tide, <datestruct VALUE="1874-03-20"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=20>20</day>, <year reg=1874>1874</year></datestruct> ;</QUOTE> the line is <num value="2">two</num> feet <num value="4">four</num> inches above the pavement, and consequently several feet above the ordinary high-water mark. <hi rend=italics>Apropos</hi> of this mention of the tide, we may state that the whole valley of the Thames was once a gulf or bay of the sea, being, in fact, but a breach or cleft in the ordinary mass of deposit which once rose for <num value="200">200</num> or <num value="300">300</num> feet above what is now the bed of the river. 
   <P>There was a ferry here more than <num value="2">two</num> centuries ago, for Evelyn records in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> <datestruct VALUE="1656-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1656">1656</year></datestruct>, how he returned by it out of Essex to Saye's Court. <QUOTE>Here,</QUOTE> Evelyn writes, <QUOTE>I saw Sir John Winter's new project of charring sea-coale to burn out the sulphur, and render it sweete. He did it by burning the coals in such earthen pots as (those in which) the glasse-men mealt <hi rend=italics>(sic</hi>) their mettall, so firing them without consuming them; using a barr of yron in each crucible or pot, which bar has a hook at <num value="1">one</num> end, so that the coales, being melted in a furnace with other crude sea-coales under them, may be drawn out of the potts sticking to the yron, whence they are beaten off in greate half-exhausted   cinders, which, being   rekindled, make a cleare, pleasant chamber fire, deprived of their sulphur and arsenic malignity. What success it may have time will discover.</QUOTE> Unfortunately,    Evelyn does not tell us whether ultimately Sir    John Winter found his project remunerative; but it may be added that within the present century the late Lord Dundonald tried to revive the plan, with the projected improvement of extracting and saving the tar.   His lordship, however, failed to make it answer; but the coal thus charred is now sold by almost every gas company under the name of coke. 
     <P>It may not be out of place to record here that the Royal Thames Yacht Club close their annual season by an excursion down the river.   The yachts rendezvous in the afternoon at Greenwich, and come to an anchor for the night at Erith.   The commodore takes the chair in the evening at the <QUOTE>Crown Inn.</QUOTE> On   the following morning the members and their friends proceed on various cruises, many of these trips extending to several days.   It may interest some of the members to know that their excursions have had a forerunner in times long gone by; for Evelyn tells us how, in the summer of <datestruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>, he sailed with <QUOTE>the merry monarch</QUOTE> in <num value="1">one</num> of his <QUOTE>yachts or pleasure boats,</QUOTE> and raced another yacht all the way to Gravesend and back, the king himself sometimes steering. <QUOTE>The king,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>lost it in going, the wind being contrary; but sav'd stakes in returning.</QUOTE> It was by joining with his subjects in these amusements that King   Charles gained that personal popularity which, in spite of his many vices, never forsook him. 
     <P>Not only with Dr. Johnson, of whom we have spoken above, but with the public at large the river  Thames has always been the favourite way of reaching Greenwich from London, both before and since the introduction of steamboats.   In former times the chief mode of conveyance on the river was by small boats rowed by watermen; but the <QUOTE>tilt boat</QUOTE> is often mentioned, in the reign of  George III., as <num value="1">one</num> of the regular conveyances <pb id="P.197" n="197"> which carried passengers down the river--to Greenwich,Woolwich, Gravesend, &amp;c. These boats started From the Dark House, at Billingsgate; they took <num value="12">twelve</num> hours on the journey to Gravesend if the weather was fair, and the wind not utterly adverse; but more, of course, if that was the case, and if they had not, reached their destination when the tide turned. These boats were   superseded by steamers, after the model of those already in use upon the Clyde, about the year <datestruct value="1816"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>.   The name of the <QUOTE>Tilt Boat</QUOTE> is still preserved on the signboards of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> riverside inns. 
   <P>The Admiralty barge was constantly employed on the silent highway of the Thames, down to a comparatively recent date, in showing the <QUOTE>lions</QUOTE> of the metropolis to distinguished foreigners.   Thus Lady Lepel Hervey, in the reign of George II., relates how, <num value="1">one</num> of the lords of the Admiralty, Mr. Stanley, did the honours on behalf of his country to the. Spanish Ambassador, his family, and several people of fashion, <QUOTE>the greatest part of whoin he carried in barges down to Greenwich, nothing being wanting of water equipage; salutes upon the river, in the greatest pomp and order; and a reception at the landing at the hospital by the admiral, the governor, and all the officers.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Greenwich has been the place of debarkation of many illustrious visitors, and several royal personages, among whom   may be noticed the Princess Augusta of Saxe Gotha, afterwards married to Frederick, Prince of Wales; and the Princess Caroline of Brunswick, who landed here in order to become the much-injured and unhappy wife of George, Prince of Wales (afterwards George IV.). From this place the latter passed on to London, in the midst of universal shouts of popular joy, her progress being almost a triumphal procession. Alas! in how short a time was she destined to rue the day!   After her separation she lived for many Fears at Charlton, on the edge of Blackheath. 
   <P><num value="1">One</num> of the last state visits of the sovereign to Greenwich was made in   <datestruct VALUE="1797-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>, when King George III. proceeded in the royal yacht to Greenwich, and thence to Sheerness to review the fleet at the Nore, and to see the Dutch ships which had been lately captured by Lord Duncan at the battle of Camperdown. 
   <P>The royal state barge was used as late as <datestruct value="1843"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>, when the Prince Consort made a progress in it from Whitehall to the Brunswick Pier, at Blackwall, for the purpose of inspecting the <hi rend=italics>Victoria and Albert</hi>
steam-yacht, then in process of construction in the East India Docks. The barge, which had just been re-fitted and re-gilt at Woolwich Dockyard, was <num value="64">sixty-four</num> feet in length, and about <num value="7">seven</num> feet in width; the head and stern were elaborately carved, and gilt, and, with her highly-varnished timbers, had a right royal splendour. The vessel was rowed by <num value="22">twenty-two</num> watermen in scarlet liveries, and the Admiralty barge, which accompanied it, by <num value="10">ten</num> men in scarlet coats. The state barge, we are told, <QUOTE>in its progress to and from Blackwall, attracted many spectators on the river and its banks, and, with the Admiralty barge, formed a splendid piece of water pageantry, such as is but rarely witnessed on London's majestic river.</QUOTE> It has long been disused, and is now laid up, destined never, probably, to be launched again, but to become the food of moths and worms. 
    <P>Overlooking the Thames, and in the immediate vicinity of the Royal Hospital, are those noted water-side hotels which have become celebrated for public dinners, and particularly for whitebait. The chief of these taverns are the <QUOTE>Ship,</QUOTE> a little to the westward of the Hospital, and the <QUOTE>Crown and  Sceptre,</QUOTE> and the <QUOTE>Trafalgar,</QUOTE> the latter of which has become celebrated for its <QUOTE>Ministerial fish dinners.</QUOTE> 
    <P> <QUOTE>At what period the lovers of good living <num value="1">first</num> went to eat whitebait at  <Q>the taverns contiguous to the places where the fish is taken,</Q>  is not very clear. At all events,</QUOTE> writes John Timbs, in his 
 <title>Club Life of London</title>, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>the houses did not resemble the  <Q>Brunswick,</Q>  the  <Q>West India Dock,</Q>  the  <Q> Ship,</Q>  or the  <Q>Trafalgar</Q>  of the present day, these having much of the architectural pretension of a modern club-house. Whitebait have long been numbered among the delicacies of our table; for we find  <Q><num value="6">six</num> dishes of whitebait</Q>  in the funeral feast of the munificent founder of the Charterhouse, given in the Hall of the Stationers' Company, on  <datestruct VALUE="1612-05-28"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1612>1612</year></datestruct>-the year before the Globe Theatre was burnt down, and the New River completed.  For aught we know, these delicious fish may have been served up to Henry VIII. and Queen Elizabeth in their palace at Greenwich, off which place, and Blackwall opposite, whitebait have been for ages taken in the Thames at flood-tide. To the river-side taverns we must go to enjoy a  <Q>whitebait dinner,</Q>  for <num value="1">one</num> of the conditions of success is that the fish should be directly netted out of the river into the cook's caldron. 
   <P>About the end of March, or early in April, whitebait make their appearance in the Thames, and are then small, apparently but just changed from the albuminous state of the young fry. During June, July, and August, immense quantities are consumed by visitors to the different taverns at Greenwich and Blackwall.   Pennant says: <QUOTE>Whitebait are esteemed very delicious when fried with <pb id="P.198" n="198"> fine flour, and occasion, during the season, a vast resort of the <hi rend=italics>lower order of epicures</hi> to the taverns contiguous to the places where they are taken.</QUOTE>
If this account be correct,</QUOTE> adds Mr. Timbs, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>there must have been a strange change in the grade of epicures   frequenting   Greenwich   and   Blackwall since Pennant's days; for at present the fashion of eating whitebait is sanctioned by the highest authorities, from   the Court of St. James's in the West, to the Lord Mayor and <hi rend=italics>his</hi> Court in the East; besides the philosophers of the Royal Society, and Her Majesty's Cabinet Ministers. Who, for example, does not recollect such a paragraph as the following, which appeared in the 
<hi rend=italics>Morning Post</hi> of the day on which Mr. Yarrell wrote his account of whitebait, <datestruct VALUE="1835-09-10"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=10>10</day>, <year reg=1835>1835</year></datestruct>:  <Q>Yesterday, the Cabinet Ministers went down the river in the Ordnance barges to Lovegrove's <Q>West India Dock Tavern,</Q> Blackwall, to partake of their annual fish dinner. Covers were laid for <num value="35">thirty-five</num> gentlemen.</Q>  For our own part, we consider that the Ministers did not evince their usual good policy in choosing so late a period as September, the whitebait being finer eating in July or August; so their  <Q>annual fish dinner</Q>  must 
<FIGURE id="Fig.198" n="2000.14.0073"><HEAD>Crown And Sceptre Inn, Greenwich.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 rather be regarded as a sort of prandial wind--up of the Parliamentary session than as a specimen of refined epicurism. 
   <P>We remember many changes in matters concerning whitebait at Greenwich and   Blackwall. Formerly, the   taverns were mostly   built with weather-board fronts, with bow-windows, so as to command a view of the river. The old  <Q>Ship,</Q>  and the  <Q>Crown and Sceptre</Q>  taverns at Greenwich were built in this manner; and some of the Blackwall houses were of humble pretensions; these have disappeared, and handsome architectural piles have been erected in their places.   Meanwhile, whitebait have been sent to the metropolis, by railway or steamer, where they figure in fishmongers' shops, and tavern <hi rend=italics>cartes</hi> of almost every degree. 
   <P>Perhaps the famed delicacy of whitebait rests as much upon its skilful cookery as upon the freshness of the fish. Dr. Pereira has published a mode of cooking in <num value="1">one</num> of Lovegrove's <Q>bait kitchens</Q> at Blackwall. The fish should be dressed within an hour after being caught, or they are apt to cling together. They are kept in water, from which they are taken by a skimmer as required; they are then thrown upon a layer of flour, contained in a large <pb id="P.199" n="199"> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.199" n="2000.14.0074"><HEAD>Easter Monday In Greenwich Park. (From An Engraving By Rawle, In The <title>European Magazine</title> of <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="P.200" n="200"> napkin, in which they are shaken until completely enveloped in flour; they are then put into a colander, and all the superfluous flour is removed by sifting. The fish are next thrown into hot lard contained in a copper caldron or stew-pan placed over a charcoal fire. In about <num value="2">two</num> minutes they are removed by a tin skimmer, thrown into a colander to drain, and served up instantly, by placing them   on a fish-drainer in a dish. The rapidity of the cooking process is of the utmost importance, and if it be not attended to, the fish will lose their crispness, and be worthless.   At table, lemon-juice is squeezed over them, and they are seasoned with cayenne pepper, brown breadand-butter is substituted for plain bread; and they are eaten with iced champagne or punch.</QUOTE>

   <P>Every year the approach of the close of the Parliamentary session is indicated by'what is termed the <QUOTE>Ministerial Fish Dinner,</QUOTE> in which whitebait forms a prominent dish, and Cabinet Ministers are the company.   The dinner takes place at <num value="1">one</num> of the principal taverns, usually at Greenwich, but sometimes at Blackwall. The dining-room is decorated for the occasion, which is of the nature of a State entertainment. Formerly, it was customary for the Ministers to go down the river from Whitehall in an Ordnance barge, ornamented with gold and other colours, and with streamers; now, however, a more prosaic steamer is employed. The origin of the annual festivity is told by Mr. Timbs in his work quoted above :--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>On the banks of Dagenham Lake or Reach, in Essex, many years since, there stood a cottage occupied by a princely merchant, named Preston, a baronet of Scotland and Nova Scotia, and sometime M.P. for Dover. He called it his  <Q>fishing-cottage,</Q>  and often in the spring he went thither, with a friend or <num value="2">two</num>, as a relief to the toils of his Parliamentary and mercantile duties.   His most frequent guest was the Right Hon. George Rose, Secretary of the Treasury, and an Elder Brother of the Trinity House. Many a day did these <num value="2">two</num> worthies enjoy at Dagenham PReach; and Mr. Rose once intimated to Sir Robert that Mr. Pitt, of whose friendship they were both justly proud, would no doubt delight in the comfort of such a retreat. A day was named, and the Premier was invited; and he was so well pleased with his reception at the  <Q>fishing-cottage</Q> --they were all <num value="2">two</num> if not <num value="3">three</num>-bottle men-that, on taking leave, Mr. Pitt readily accepted an invitation for the following year. 
   <P>For a few years, the Premier continued a visitor to Dagenham, and was always accompanied by Mr. George Rose. But the distance was considerable; the going and coming were somewhat inconvenient for the <num value="1">First</num> Minister of the Crown. Sir Robert Preston, however, had   his remedy, and he proposed that they should in future dine nearer London.   Greenwich was suggested: we do not hear of whitebait in the Dagenham   dinners, and its introduction probably   dates from   the removal to Greenwich. The party of <num value="3">three</num> was now increased to <num value="4">four</num>, Mr. Pitt being permitted to bring Lord Camden.   Soon after, a <num value="5">fifth</num> guest was invited-Mr. Charles Long, afterwards Lord Farnborough.   All were still the guests of Sir Robert Preston; and, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, other notables were invited-all Tories-and, at last, Lord Camden considerately remarked that, as they were all dining at a tavern, it was but fair that Sir Robert Preston should be relieved from   the expense.   It was then arranged that the dinner should be given as usual by Sir Robert Preston--that is to say, at his invitation-and he insisted on still contributing a buck and champagne; the rest of the charges were thenceforth defrayed by the several guests; and on this plan, the meeting continued to take place annually, till the death of Mr. Pitt. 
    <P>Sir Robert was requested, next year, to summon the several guests, the list of whom, by this time, included most of the Cabinet Ministers.   The time for meeting was usually after Trinity Monday --a short period before the end of the session.   By degrees, the meeting, which was originally purely gastronomic, appears to have assumed, in consequence of the long reign of the Tories, a political or semi-political character.   Sir Robert Preston died; but Mr. Long (now   Lord Farnborough) undertook to summon the several guests, the list of whom   was furnished by Sir Robert Preston's private secretary. Hitherto, the invitations had been sent privately; now they were dispatched in Cabinet boxes, and the party was, certainly, for some time, limited to the members of the Cabinet. A dinner lubricates Ministerial as well as other business; so that the  <Q>Ministerial Fish Dinner</Q>  may  <Q>contribute to the grandeur and prosperity of our beloved country.</Q> </QUOTE>

   <P>From   that day to the present the Ministerial dinner has been an annual festival, except when some sudden death has lately carried off a member of the existing Cabinet.   The dinner is usually held a day or <num value="2">two</num> before the prorogation of the Houses of Parliament. 
   <P>But some other statesmen, who have not been Ministers of the Crown, have regaled themselves here on whitebait.   Samuel Rogers, for instance, tells us that he once dined with Curran in the public room of the chief inn at Greenwich, when the Irish orator, as usual, began to indulge in his <pb id="P.201" n="201"> favourite exaggerations. <QUOTE>I had rather be hanged on <num value="20">twenty</num> gallows</QUOTE> --he began, when a stranger sitting at the next table quietly asked, <QUOTE>Do you not think, sir, that <num value="1">one</num> would be enough?</QUOTE> Curran was, for once, fairly taken aback and struck dumb at the witty retort. 
     <P>But few dinners at Greenwich, perhaps, were more jovial and pleasant than that which, in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>, celebrated the return of Charles Dickens from his <num value="1">first</num> visit to America. Talfourd, Milnes, Procter, Maclise, Stanfield, Marryat, Barham, Hood, John Forster, and George Cruickshank were there; and a home tour into Cornwall was then and there arranged between <QUOTE>Boz,</QUOTE> Maclise, Stanfield, and his future biographer-all now, alas! no more. It was at a dinner here-preceded by a drive over Blackheath--that Dickens and Douglas Jerrold met for the last time, just previous to the sudden death of the latter, in <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>A great change has come over the inns and taverns of half a century ago; they are now <QUOTE>hotels,</QUOTE> and grand ones too; the <QUOTE>Trafalgar</QUOTE> still has its bow-windows fronting the river; but of the old <QUOTE>Ship</QUOTE> and the <QUOTE>Crown and Sceptre,</QUOTE> their earlier and more attractive features have now disappeared, giving way to architectural piles of greater pretensions, and in which, therefore, the cost of a dinner must be largely increased, in order to pay the builder. 
    <P>It is remarked by more than <num value="1">one</num> writer, that  Greenwich is about the last place where the practice of <QUOTE>touting</QUOTE> for customers is kept up at the doors of small coffee-houses; but, perhaps, the wellknown cry of the butchers in the lesser streets on  Saturday evenings, <QUOTE>Come, buy! buy! what will you buy?</QUOTE> may be regarded as the last remnant of a custom once nearly universal. Here you cannot walk along the streets which lie between the town and the park without being solicited by <num value="10">ten</num> or a dozen rival houses to step in and regale yourself.  If you take every card that is offered you, you will have a good store in your pocket on returning home at night. <QUOTE>Tea, eightpence, with a pleasant view of the river.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Tea made, with shrimps, ninepence,</QUOTE> and so forth. The inhabitants of Greenwich would seem to be the most accommodating and hospitable people in the world. You can walk straight into almost every other house along the route and order tea, and can depart again only a few pence the poorer. Numbers of cockneys, however, come to the park already well provided; and you may see pater and materfamilias and half a dozen of their hopeful progeny all munching breadand-butter, and drinking cold tea, in <num value="1">one</num> group beneath the chestnuts. 
    <P>For very many years, and down to a comparatively recent date (<datestruct value="1857"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>), there were <num value="2">two</num> fairs held annually in Greenwich-namely, on the Monday,  Tuesday, and Wednesday in Easter and Whitsun weeks.   They were formerly held in the road now occupied partly by St. Mary's Church, and the remainder by the Hospital Burial-ground; latterly, the fairs were held in the public thoroughfares, principally in Bridge Street, which extends from near the church of St. Alphege to the bridge over the   Ravensbourne at Deptford Creek.   In an account of Greenwich Fair, the <QUOTE>Kalendar of  Amusements</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>) somewhat bombastically observes: <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>This great national event, which neither desires nor deserves any colouring at our hands, is <num value="1">one</num> of those gaudy and glittering occasions which, like powerful magnets, attract all the base ore of the metropolis.   The objects of commiseration, who have groaned through a long winter with afflictions (stated in coloured chalks on the portion of pavement they diurnally occupy), who, in the  Van Amburgh spirit, have taught a little dog to implore and to accept contributions for them-the absence of arms, tongues, eyes, legs, &amp;c., in a great measure preventing them officiating <hi rend=italics>personally</hi>
--now, vigorous and volatile, spring nimbly on the apex of the metropolitan mail, articulating  <Q>Greenwich, ho!</Q>    Now, the fervid children of Erin, with a  <Q>Horroo! Faugh a ballagh!</Q>  ( <Q>Clear the road!</Q> ) enlarge themselves from the liberties of little Hibernia, and turn their frontispieces towards  Greenwich.   (Their less energetic brethren have preceded them   a <hi rend=italics>week</hi>, that being the time they annually consume in <hi rend=italics>drinking</hi> their way down.) 
    <P>Now, from the cigar-divans in the Strand and the Quadrant, fair count(er)esses may be observed stepping into private carriages driven by private gentlemen, who, dispensing with their slaves in livery, and hoping the populace will mistake them for  <Q>those blackguard lords,</Q>  whirl through the streets, as a Bristol Byron says,  <Q> in all the majesty of mud.</Q>  Now, upon the road may be seen stages-and-<num value="4">four</num>, coaches-and-<num value="2">two</num>, and cabs-and-<num value="1">one</num> with 
<hi rend=italics>cram</hi> licences--a term well known to the <hi rend=italics>whipsters,</hi>
who upon this day, by superhuman exertions, prove their right to the title.   Here, like Atlas struggling under a giddy world, a wretched donkey wags (we use the next word advisedly) <hi rend=italics>under</hi> a wagon, which must have been erected to mock the efforts of a troop   of horse.   Countless hands, armed with countless missiles, stimulate the martyr in the rear, whilst a child precedes him holding a wisp of hay to his mouth.   The bait has its effect: of the posterior applications he appears happily unconscious.   But who and what are they that occupy <pb id="P.202" n="202"> that vehicle?   Alas! none but themselves know who they are, or what they would be. The police reports, it is true, afford some information, and that of a nature perhaps to satisfy a <hi rend=italics>moral</hi> curiosity. 
    <P>How shall we describe Greenwich?   Confusion and consternation! hilarity and horror   Children not visible, pocket-handkerchiefs not forthcoming  (distress for each equally evident). People here full of frenzy, exclaiming,  <Q> What imposition!</Q>   Others there, full of frolic, lisping out,  <Q> What fun!</Q>   Sirens insinuating,  <Q>Tea   and   coffee! tea and coffee!</Q>  and slaughterers shouting,  <Q><measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">One</num> shilling</measure> a head, sump-tu-ous dinners!</Q>  At night, the  <Q>fair and free</Q>  assemble in the  <Q>Crown and Anchor,</Q>    <Q>The Palladium of British Freedom,</Q>   <Q> The Thunderdox,</Q>  and   <Q>The   Roaring--Rattling--Rioters</Q>
booths, where the waltz is done strict justice to, and the orchestra, assisted by the united exertions of all present, absolutely intoxicates the ear. Outside, they revel also, the  <Q>shilling considerers,</Q>  preferring a penny privilege, are swung up into the face of heaven, and <hi rend=italics>vice versa</hi>, in a machine very like a gallows, which is put in motion by a fellow very like an executioner.      Others speculate in porter and pudding, and laugh at the vanity of human nature.</QUOTE>

    <P>There was not, however, a goodlier day of merrymaking, for the regular traditional Monday-keepers, passed in the neighbourhood of London, than at  Greenwich   Fair.   The   Pool and   the Port of  London are always objects of astonishment to a foreigner; but to see them   on Whit Monday, or at the commencement of a fine Easter-week, was the most extraordinary sight he could meet with. <QUOTE>The   river below   bridge,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Albert  Smith, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>presented a singularly animated scene.  Nearly all the vessels in the Pool hoisted their flags, in compliment to the holiday-bands of music, that only appeared competent to play  <Q> Love not</Q>  and  <Q>Jeannette and Jeannot,</Q>  were stationed at some of the wharfs, or on board the boats; and almost every minute a steamer passed, deep in the water, by reason of her crowded freight of human beings.   It was only by extreme look-out that numberless accidents were avoided; for the highway was covered with small boats as well, together with ships being towed into dock, and heavy barges always getting directly across the way, so that sometimes a perfect stoppage of several minutes was necessary.   Every available   corner of the decks, cabins, and paddle-boxes of the steamers was occupied; and more than <num value="2">two</num>-thirds of the voyagers were obliged to be content with standingroom   during   the journey-which, under these circumstances, was not made very rapidly.   Indeed, we were but little under the hour going from Swan Stairs to Greenwich Pier; but everybody was in thorough good   temper with themselves and everybody else, so that there was no grumbling at the want of accommodation.   They appeared only too happy to get there at all, albeit all the way the boats rolled and swayed until the water nearly washed in at the cabin windows. 
    <P>The fair began directly you landed.   From the   <Q>Ship Torbay Tavern</Q>  up to the park gates, the road was bordered on either side with stalls, games, and   hand-wagons, containing goods or refreshments of every description. Mr. Punch, too, set up the temple of his illegitimate drama at <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> points of the thoroughfare, at each of which  (in our belief that there is but <num value="1">one</num> Punch, and that he is ubiquitous) he was pursuing that reckless career of vice and dissipation with which his audience are always so delighted. Snuff-boxes to throw at-refreshments of singularly untempting appearance, which nevertheless found eager purchasers-vendors of spring rattles, who ensured  <Q>the whole fun o&lsquo; the fair for a penny </Q> --speculators in heavy stocks of Waterloo crackers and detonating balls--proprietors of small percussion guns, to shoot with at targets for nuts-kept increasing, together with the visitors, as we neared the park; until the diminished breadth of the street brought them all together in <num value="1">one</num> struggle to get through the gates, like the grains of sand in an egg-glass. 
 <gap> The  <Q>fair,</Q>  properly so called, was a long narrow thoroughfare of stalls, booths, and shows, in a lane leading from the town to the bridge at  Deptford Creek.   Perhaps this was the least attractive part of the day's amusement.   The crowd was so dense and disorderly as to threaten each minute the erection of barricades of  <Q>brandy-snaps,</Q>  and the overthrow and deposition of the gilt gingerbread kings ranged on each side.   More refreshment stalls bordered the way-wonderfully uninviting shell-fish, of shapes you had never before encountered-mysterious effervescing drinks, like dirty soapsuds and carbonic acid mixed togethereels in different states of cookery, pickled, stewed, and in pies-strangely indigestible lumps of pudding, studded at uncertain intervals with black lumps, presumed to be plums-masses of cold fried fish, liberally peppered with dust; and dreadful oysters as large as soup-plates-oysters in June!  But all were doing good business, and rapidly disposing of their stock. 
   <P>The shows, possibly, were our greatest delight, for we love to be harmlessly imposed upon at these wandering exhibitions. The last time we were at Greenwich Fair we saw <num value="1">one</num> held in a dismantled <pb id="P.203" n="203"> dwelling-house, where various forms in wax-work, of the true Mrs. Jarley breed, were set up for inspection.   In the recess of a window were placed <num value="2">two</num> figures, evidently intended, originally, for Amy   Robsart and the Earl of Leicester, but which represented, we were now told, Queen Victoria and   Prince Albert, enjoying the retirement of private life, apart from the pomp of royalty.   Why they should have chosen to enjoy retirement in fancy dresses of the Elizabethan period, those best acquainted with the habits of those august personages can possibly inform us. All the characters of the exhibition were, however, old friends. We fancied that we once knew them   in High Holborn, where the organ turned at the door, and the monkey sat on the hot gas-pipe.   At all events, if they were not the identical ones, the artist had cast <num value="2">two</num> in the same mould whilst he was about it. We do not think he had been happy in the likenesses.   Sir Robert Peel was, unmistakably, Mr. Buckstone grown a foot taller, and wearing a light flaxen wig. Lady Sale we once knew as Queen   Adelaide; and   Oxford   had   transmigrated into   Wicks, the eyes having been manifestly wrenched violently round to form   the squint of the latter miserable culprit. In <num value="1">one</num> point the artist had excelled nature. He had preserved the apparent dryness and coolness of the skin, whilst the folks looking on were melting with the heat. 
    <P>In another show   were some learned birds.  This was also held in an unfinished house.   A curtain nailed to the rafters divided the rude interior into <num value="2">two</num> parts; by pushing it aside we saw a flock-bed upon the ground, a mouldering fire, and a tin saucepan: a thin, unhappy dog was persuading himself that he was asleep on the bed.  In front of the <hi rend=italics>penetralia</hi> was a dirty breeding-cage, in which <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> poor little ragged canaries were sitting on a perch, huddled up together as if for better self-defence. A man came to the front and said,  <Q>Stand back, gents, and then all can see-the canaries, the performing canaries, brought from the  Canary Islands for the Queen.</Q>  The birds were then taken out, and had to pull carts and draw water, sit on the end of a trumpet whilst it was played, and fire cannon; the explosion of the gunpowder throwing them   into a state of tumbling, chuffing, and sneezing, from which they did not recover by the conclusion of the entertainment. 
   <P>As soon as it was dusk, the crowd in the fair thickened; and its sole object appeared to be to push a way violently through everything to the extreme end, and then return again in the same manner.   In the town every tavern and publichouse was filled to overflowing with hungry, or rather thirsty, occupants; the clouds of tobaccosmoke from the open windows proving the crowded state of the apartments.   The steamboats had now ceased to ply, but the trains on the railway continued until a late hour. If you returned to town by the latter method of conveyance, you met hundreds more proceeding to Greenwich, even at very advanced periods of the evening. Where they got to when they arrived, how they contrived to return home again when the fair closed, is beyond conjecture.   Those, however, who went simply to look on were not sorry, by this time, to get clear of the increasing riot and confusion, to which, on arriving once more in London, the bustle of Cheap. side appeared almost seclusion and tranquillity.</QUOTE>

    <P>The fag-end, as we may call it, of the fair was almost always noisy and disreputable. It is thus described by Mr. J. R. PlanchM, in his <QUOTE>Recollections,</QUOTE> as it appeared to him   and a French friend, his fellow-traveller, on his return from  Paris in <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>It was broad daylight by the time we reached the junction of the Greenwich and Old Kent Roads, and a sight suddenly presented itself to the   eyes of our visitor which astonished, interested, and amused him   to the greatest extent.   On each side of the road, <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> deep, a line of human beings extended as far as the eye could reach: men and women, boys and girls, the majority of the adults of both sexes in every possible stage of intoxication, yelling, screaming, dancing, fighting, playing every conceivable antic, and making every inconceivable noise. For the instant I was almost as much surprised as my companion, and as little able to account for the extraordinary and unexpected scene; but after a few minutes I recollected it was the morning of the Wednesday in Easter week, and the end of  Greenwich Fair, and these dregs of the London populace, which   had for <num value="3">three</num> days made the pretty Kentish borough a bear-garden, and its fine old park a pandemonium, were now flowing in a turbid flood of filth, rags, debauchery, and drunkenness, back to their sources in the slums of the metropolis. There was no picturesque costume to fascinate the eye of the artist, no towering <hi rend=italics>cauchoise</hi>
with its frills and streamers, no snow-white caps, short scarlet petticoats, and blue stockings, no embroidered velvet bodices, no quaint gold or silver head-gear, no jacket gay with countless buttons, no hat bedecked with ribbons, no coquettish  Montero; all was dirt and   squalor, draggled dresses, broken   bonnets, hats without crowns, coats and   trousers in   tatters.   Such was the  British public as it <num value="1">first</num> appeared to    <Q>the great French comedian.</Q> .</QUOTE> -- <pb id="P.204" n="204"> 
   <P>A   writer in the <hi rend=italics>Somerset House Gazette and Literary Museum</hi>, in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, could complain, and apparently with some show of truth, that even in his time Greenwich merry-making was but the ghost of what it had been. He bewails the utter absence of that <QUOTE>joyous vulgarity, that freedom, fun, and variety,</QUOTE> which had been its boast and attraction; but <QUOTE>still,</QUOTE> he adds, by way of compensation, <QUOTE>there was a tolerable display, a sickly smile of gaiety about the place.

The uniform of the military was very imposing; they were

 attired in suits of gold leaf; to swallow <num value="1">one</num> of the doughty heroes would have been to realise the fate of Crassus. Next succeeded the legerdemain and  <Q>rowly-powly</Q>  gentry; the mermaids and mountebanks, and wonders of every class, from a penny to sixpence, which showed that the fair had not altogether declined   from   its ancient character.   To quote the old ballad about another fair-

<P>It was, no doubt, the peculiar charm of this unrivalled prospect that made Greenwich for so many ages the favourite seat of our Tudor monarchs, to whose purposes it was excellently adapted, both for its vicinity to the metropolis and its commanding situation. But far different must have been the scene when (we are told) Henry VIII., in the <num value="7">seventh</num> year of his reign, on a fine May-day morning, with Queen Katharine his wife, accompanied also by many lords and ladies, rode a-Maying from Greenwich to the high ground of Shooter's Hill, where, as they passed by the way, they espied a company of tall yeomen all in green, with hoods, and with bows and arrows, to the number of <num value="200">two hundred</num>. Since that day, alterations have taken place which must astonish even the last generation, large tracts of land, which then were either marketgardens or pastures for cattle, being now converted into docks or built over as streets. 
    <P> <QUOTE>Let us pause,</QUOTE> writes Mr. T. Miller, in his <QUOTE>Picturesque Sketches of London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>on the brow of this hill, and recall a few of the scenes which these aged hawthorns have looked upon. They are the ancient foresters of the chase, and many of them have stood here through the wintry storms of past centuries, and were gnarled, and knotted, and stricken with age, long before Evelyn planned and planted those noble rows of chestnuts and elms.  Below, between the plain at the foot of the hill and the river, stood the old palace of Greenwich, in which Henry VIII. held his revels, and where  Edward VI., the boy-king, breathed his last. That ancient palace was, no doubt, rich with the spoils of many a plundered abbey and ruined monastery --in vessels of gold and silver which had once been dedicated to holy purposes, but were then red with the dregs of the wine shed at many a midnight revel by the  <Q> Defender of the Faith </Q> --the woman. murdering monarch. Perhaps,</QUOTE> he suggests, with a vein of dry humour, <QUOTE>the walls of that old palace were hung with the portraits of the wives whom he had caused to be beheaded, whilst his own likeness in the centre gazed, like a tiger, out of the frame upon his prey.   On this hill, again, Cardinal Wolsey may have meditated,  <Q>with all his blushing honours thick upon him.</Q>  Katharine, the brokenhearted queen, may here have reined--in her palfrey, or from this aged hawthorn have torn off a sprig, when fragrant and white with may-blossom, as now, and have presented it with a smile to the royal savage who rode beside her. On yonder plain, where so many happy faces are now seen, in former days the tournament was held. There gaudy galleries were erected, over which youth and beauty leant as they waved their embroidered scarves. We can almost fancy that we can see the crowned tiger smile as he closes the visor of his helmet, bowing his plume while he recognises some fair face which was soon to fall on the scaffold, with its long tresses dabbled in blood. . . . . In this park the crafty Cecil mused, doubtless, for many an hour, as he plotted the return of the Princess Mary, while the ink was scarcely dry in which he had recorded his allegiance to the Lady Jane Grey. In fact, the whole scenery of the park teems with the remembrance of old stirring events and grave historical associations. Hal, the royal murderer, comes straddling and blowing up the hill; the pale and sickly boy-king rides gently by, and breathes heavily as he inhales the sweet air on the summit; the titter and merry laugh of the illstarred queens seems to fall upon the ear from behind the trees that conceal them. And then we have voices of mourning and loud lament from fair attendants, who refuse to be comforted, for those whom they loved and served are there no more.</QUOTE> This, we may add, is a very pretty and poetical picture, but none the less true for all that. 
    <P><LEMMA id="lemma.207.1">This park</LEMMA> is the same as that previously mentioned<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="165">165</num>.</NOTE> as having been enclosed by Humphrey,  Duke of Gloucester, in <datestruct value="1433--"><year reg="1433">1433</year></datestruct>, by licence of King  Henry VI.   It contains nearly <num value="200">200</num> acres, and was <pb id="P.207" n="207"> walled round by James I. Here, as in Kensington Gardens, we find the umbrageous trees that were planted by Gilpin and Le Notre, and the gardeners of William   III. It was chiefly laid out by Le Notre, about the same time as St. James's Park, by order of Charles II., who, it is recorded, watched with great eagerness the work of laying out this park. As early as the spring of <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, Pepys records that, <QUOTE>The king hath planted trees and made steps in the hill up to the castle, which is very magnificent.</QUOTE> The <QUOTE>castle</QUOTE> here referred to was a tower erected by Duke Humphrey, on the site now occupied by the Observatory. Traces of Le Notre's <QUOTE>steps</QUOTE> or terraces are still observable in the hill-side leading to it. Castle Hill, it would seem, was at <num value="1">one</num> time used as a <QUOTE>butt</QUOTE> or target for military practice; at all events, Evelyn, in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date of <datestruct VALUE="1667-06-1"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1667>1667</year></datestruct>, writes: <QUOTE>I went to Greenewich, where his Majesty was trying divers granados shot out of cannon at the Castle Hill from the house in the park; they brake not till they hit the mark; the forg'd ones brake not at all, but the cast ones very well. The inventor was a German.</QUOTE> Of the time when the chief avenues were planted we get the exact date from the following entry in Evelyn's <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> where, under date of <datestruct VALUE="1664-03-4"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=4>4</day>, <year reg=1664>1664</year></datestruct>, he writes: <QUOTE>This Spring I planted the Home-field and West-field about Saye's Court with elmes, being the same yeare that the elmes were planted by his Majesty in Greenewich Park.</QUOTE> Now, however, except in the remains of some of the avenues, there are not very strong traces of the stiff and formal style of Le Notre left, as it is not on a beautifully-varied surface like this that straight walks and regular lines of trees are at all tolerable. The natural advantages of this park are certainly superior to those of any in the immediate vicinity of the metropolis. <QUOTE>The ground itself,</QUOTE> says the author of <QUOTE>Bohn's Pictorial Handbook of London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>is undulated with great variety, sometimes being thrown up into the softest swells, and in other places assuming a bolder and more sudden elevation. Around the site of the Observatory it is particularly steep, and attains a considerable height. Everywhere, too, it is studded with noble specimens of ancient trees; and in this respect there are none of the other London parks at all equal to it. Some of the best trees are Spanish chestnuts, and the largest are on the south side.   Many of these are truly fine and venerable, and would command admiration even if found in the heart of a purely rural district. The elms, which are abundant, are likewise large and noble; and there are some picturesque Scotch firs in the neighbourhood of the Observatory. These last are old enough to show the peculiar warm   reddish colouring of the stems, and the characteristic horizontal or tufted heads. In this state, the Scotch fir is certainly <num value="1">one</num> of the most picturesque trees we possess, and is the more valuable because each individual plant commonly takes a shape and character of its own. The avenues still remaining in <LEMMA id="lemma.207.2">Greenwich Park</LEMMA> are composed chiefly of elm and Spanish chestnut, the latter being mostly confined to the upper part of the park. They are of different widths, and take various directions, many of them not appearing to have any definite object, and some being formed of <num value="2">two</num> single rows, others of <num value="2">two</num> double rows of trees. But there is <num value="1">one</num> avenue-perhaps the finest-which, widening out at the base to correspond with the width of the hospital, is there composed of elms, but as it ascends the hill is made up wholly of Scotch firs, which are exceedingly good. In a general way, the trees in the avenues have been planted much too thickly, and have greatly injured or spoiled each other. In many instances, too, where plants have died out, they have been replaced   by a most unhappy mixture of sorts, which, being also very poor specimens, detract much from the effect. At the upper part of the park are some aged and fine thorns, which have become very picturesque.</QUOTE> The chestnuts in Blackheath Avenue have passed maturity, and every year seems to be telling on their strength.   Many of them   have magnificent trunks, and a few of them exceed eighteen feet in girth; some of the chestnuts, too, have attained a noble growth. The oaks are comparatively few, but among them are some of the largest trees in the park. The whole extent of the park is greatly varied in surface, and hence its great charm. As Mr. James Thorne, in his <QUOTE>Environs of London,</QUOTE> remarks, <QUOTE>Everywhere the scenery is different, and everywhere beautiful; while from   the high and broken ground by the Observatory and <num value="1">One</num>-Tree Hill the distant views of London and the Thames, with its shipping, are matchless of beauty and interest.   The park,</QUOTE> he continues, <QUOTE>is the most popular of our open-air places of resort, and on a fine holiday is really a remarkable spectacle. It says something for the conduct of the crowds who resort hither, that the deer, of which there is a large number in the park, are so tame and fearless, that they will not only feed from visitors' hands, but even steal cakes from unwary children.</QUOTE>

 <pb id="P.208" n="208"> is so called from there having been but <num value="1">one</num> tree on its summit; this tree, however, has long been greatly decayed, and <num value="6">six</num> others were, some years ago, planted near it. It was in former times called <QUOTE><num value="5">Five</num>-tree Hill.</QUOTE> 
   <P>About the year <datestruct value="1816"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct> it was proposed to raise a monumental trophy, in honour of the battle of Trafalgar, on the summit of Castle Hill, near the Observatory, but the project was relinquished for want of sufficient funds. This trophy was intended to have been elevated to a height of about <num value="200">200</num> feet, and, had it been carried into effect, would have been a landmark to vessels on the river, and a conspicuous object to the country for miles around. On the brow of the hill, in the park, and about the front of the Observatory, you would see, till very recently, the old pensioners with their telescopes and glasses of every colour. Some of these heroes, who had served under Jervis and Nelson, had lost a leg or an arm, or possibly both; and yet they went about the park with their <QUOTE>baccy</QUOTE> as happy, to all appearance at least, as the credulous cockneys whom they delighted to cram with all sorts of improbable yarns about battles fought by <QUOTE>flood or field,</QUOTE> in which they shot their cannonballs to the very longest of all possible ranges. This hill was a favourite place, not only for the Greenwich pensioners, but for gipsies and fortunetellers. 
   <P> <QUOTE>The park,</QUOTE> writes the ingenious Arthur Young, in a somewhat poetic strain, <QUOTE>is well stocked with deer, and affords as much variety in proportion to its size as any in the kingdom; but the views from   the Observatory and <num value="1">One</num>-Tree Hill are beautiful beyond imagination   . . . The projection of these hills is so bold that you do not look down upon a gradually falling slope, but at once upon the tops of branching trees, which grow in knots and clumps out of dead hollows and embrowning dells.   The cattle which feed on the lawns, and appear in the breaks among them, seem to move in a region of fairy-land.   A <num value="1000">thousand</num> natural openings among the branches of the trees break upon little picturesque views of the swelling turf, which, when lit up by the sun, have an effect pleasing beyond the power of fancy to exhibit. This is the foreground of the landscape; a little further the eye falls upon that noble structure, the hospital, in the midst of an amphitheatre of wood; then the <num value="2">two</num> reaches in the river make that beautiful serpentine which forms the Isle of Dogs. .         . To the left appears a fine (?) tract of country, leading up to the capital itself, which there finishes the prospect.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The same view is thus described by Thomas  Miller, in his work above quoted:-- <QUOTE>Beautiful as is Greenwich Park within itself, with its long aisles of overhanging chestnuts, through whose branches the sunlight streams, and throws upon the velvet turf rich chequered rays of green and gold, yet it is the vast view which stretches out on every hand that gives its chief charm to the spot.

Far away the broad bright river Thames rolls along till lost in the dim green of the fading distance, whilst its course is still pointed out by the spreading sail.  Along this ancient road of the swans vessels approach from   every corner of the habitable globe to empty their riches into the great reservoir of  London, whence they are again   sent through a <num value="1000">thousand</num> channels to the remotest homes in her islands and her colonies.</QUOTE> 
    <P>We have already mentioned that this park was a favourite lounge for Dr. Johnson during the time he was lodging in Greenwich. <QUOTE>We walked in the evening in Greenwich Park,</QUOTE> writes Boswell. <QUOTE>He asked me, I suppose by way of trying my disposition,  <Q>Is not this very fine?</Q>    Having no exquisite relish of the beauties of nature, and being more delighted with  <Q>the   busy hum   of men,</Q>  I answered,  <Q>Yes, sir; but not equal to Fleet Street.</Q>

   <P>Groups of nurserymaids and children are familiar features in the modern aspect of Greenwich Park. The latter flit, climb, and leap over every broken hillock, slide into every green dell, swing, toss, and tumble round and upon each sinewy tree, as if they were the legitimate possessors of the park, and lived entirely upon gingerbread, oranges, nuts, and lemonade-viands which, it seems proper to believe, are indispensable to the real enjoyment of these shady avenues. 
   <P>In Albert Smith's description of Greenwich Fair, from which we have quoted largely in the preceding chapter, part of the scene is laid in the park. <QUOTE>It was a great relief to exchange the dust and jostling of the streets,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE>for the greensward and wide area of the park, albeit the grass was, in some places, perfectly shuffled away by the countless feet that passed over it in the course of the day.   Observatory Hill was the chief point of attraction, and here the great mass of the people was collected.   Nothing could be more animated or mirth-inspiring than the <hi rend=italics>coup d&lsquo;oeil</hi> from   the summit of this rise.   The myriads of visitors all in their gayest dresses, for the humblest amongst them had mounted something new, be [were] it only a ribbon, in compliment to the holiday--the perpetual motion of the different groups and their various occupations--the continuation of the bustle to the river, seen beyond the hospital, covered with ships and steamboats as far as the eye could reach --and above all, the clear bright light shed over the entire panorama, except where the cloudy smoke of London hung on the horizon-altogether formed a moving picture of life and festivity only to be witnessed at Greenwich.   The maimed and weather-beaten forms of the old pensioners offered odd contrasts to the lively active groups on every side. But even they were keeping holiday. Some of them, it is true, would have found it a task of no small difficulty to climb up the hill, or run down it, with the alacrity or headlong velocity of the younger visitors; so they contented themselves with sitting down upon the smooth turf to watch the others, or entertaining attentive listeners with their accounts of former engagements, in descriptions which depended more or less upon the fertility of their imaginations, but so ingeniously framed that they usually were contrived to end in an eleemosynary appeal to the generosity of the  <Q>noble captain</Q>  or other complimentary officer who listened to them. The other chief entertainments on the Observatory Hill consisted in running down with helter-skelter rapidity, or scrambling oranges and apples amongst the boys on its declivity, which fruits were liberally showered forth by the more wealthy visitors on the summit.   Frequently, an unwary damsel, crossing the slope, was entrapped by a handkerchief extended between <num value="2">two</num> swift-footed swains, and compelled to finish her journey down the hill in much quicker time than she intended.   And then what struggling there was-what exclamations of  <Q> Ha&lsquo; done, then!</Q>  and  <Q>Be quiet, now!</Q>  until there was no breath left to give utterance to these remonstrances, and the victim was hurried to the foot of the steep between her <num value="2">two</num> reckless persecutors, fortunate if she arrived at the foot without any downfall.   For such accidents were of common occurrence, and roars of laughter arose from the crowds on either side when any luckless wight overran himself, and saluted the turf in consequence.</QUOTE> 
   <P> <QUOTE>If Easter Monday draws up the curtain of our popular merriments,</QUOTE> writes the author of <title>Merrie England in the Olden Time</title>, <QUOTE>Whit Monday, not a whit less merry, trumpets their continuation. We hail the return of these festive seasons when the busy inhabitants of Lud's town and its suburbs, in spite of hard times, tithes, and taxes, repair to the royal park of Queen Bess to divert their melancholy.   We delight to contemplate the mirthful mourners in their endless variety of character and costume; to behold the festive holiday-makers hurrying to the jocund scenes, in order to share in those pleasures which the Genius of wakes, so kind and bounteous, prepares for her votaries.   The gods themselves assembled   on Olympus presented not a more glorious sight than the laughing divinities of  <Q> <num value="1">One</num>-Tree Hill.</Q>  What an animated scene! Hark to the loud laugh of some youngsters that have had their roll and tumble. Yonder is a wedding party from the neighbouring village of Charlton or Eltham. See the jolly tar with his true-blue jacket and trousers, checked shirt, radiant with a gilt brooch as big as a crownpiece, yellow straw hat, striped stockings, and pumps, and his pretty bride, with her rosy cheeks and white favours.   How light are their heels and their hearts too!   And the blithesome couples that follow in their train, novices in the Temple of Hymen, but who will, ere long, be called upon to act as principals! All is congratulation, good wishes, and good   humour.   Scandal is dumb; envy dies for the day; disappointment gathers <pb id="P.210" n="210"> hope; and <num value="1">one</num> wedding-like a fool, or an Irish wake-shall make many.</QUOTE> 
   <P>About June the park may be seen in all its bloom   and beauty--the fine old hawthorns are then still in full blossom, and the hundreds of gigantic elms and chestnuts are hung in their richest array of summer green, whilst here and there the deer cross and re-cross the shady avenues, or, crouching amid what is called the <QUOTE>wilderness,</QUOTE> lie half buried in the fan-like fern. The hill and the plain below, and, in fact, the whole greensward round, are clothed in their holiday attire, the female part of the community lighting up the scene by the varied hues of their dress. At every few yards you meet with a new group of pleasure-seekers, whilst the long avenue which leads up to Blackheath is <num value="1">one</num> continuous stream of merry-looking people. 
   <P>On the south-west side of the park, and facing Blackheath, stands the Ranger's Lodge, a brickbuilt mansion, formerly the residence of Philip, Earl of Chesterfield, who purchased it about the middle of the last century, and considerably enlarged and improved it.   In his <QUOTE>Letters</QUOTE> the earl calls it <QUOTE>Babiole</QUOTE> and afterwards <QUOTE>La Petite Chartreuse;</QUOTE> but it was commonly known as 
<FIGURE id="Fig.210" n="2000.14.0077"><HEAD>View In Greenwich Park.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 Chesterfield House, and his connection with it is still kept in remembrance by the name of <QUOTE>Chesterfield Walk,</QUOTE> which has been given to the shady pathway running along under the park wall from the top of Croom's Hill.   In <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct> the house became the residence of the Duchess of Brunswick, sister of George III., and was thereupon called Brunswick House.   The duchess came hither in consequence of her daughter, Caroline, Princess of Wales, having had the adjoining mansion, Montagu House, assigned her as a residence when appointed Ranger of Greenwich Park, in the year <datestruct value="1806"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>. On her death the house was purchased by the Crown, and appropriated as the residence of the Ranger. Here the Princess Sophia resided from <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct> till her death.   In more recent times it was the residence of Prince Arthur, now Duke of Connaught, whilst studying for the Engineers. 
   <P>Montagu House, which stood immediately to the south of the Ranger's Lodge, owed its name to having belonged to the Duke of Montagu, who bought it in <datestruct value="1714--"><year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct>.   Whilst it was the residence of the Princess of Wales, the grounds attached to it were enlarged by enclosing a portion of the park, called the <QUOTE>Little Wilderness.</QUOTE> This now forms <pb id="P.211" n="211">

Montagu House was pulled down in <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, but the name is preserved in Montagu Corner, at the end of Chesterfield Walk. At the junction of Chesterfield Walk and Croom's Hill is a large mansion, once the seat of General Wolfe, and the occasional residence of his son, the hero of Quebec, whose remains were brought hither before they were buried in Greenwich Church.   The house was afterwards the residence of Lord Lyttelton. 
   <P>On the south-west side of the park, above the summit of the hill, and in the rear of the house above mentioned, are several barrows, or tumuli, which, it has been conjectured, may have been the burial-places of the Danes during their encampment on Blackheath. Some of them were opened towards the end of the last century, when there were discovered in them spear-heads, human bones and hair, knives, fragments of woollen cloth, and other articles. 
   <P>It is time now that we made our way once more to the summit of the hill whereon stands the Observatory, a spot which Tickell calls- 
     <QUOTE REND=blockquote>That fair hill where hoary sages boast         To name the stars and count the heavenly host.</QUOTE>
The Observatory, as we have mentioned above,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>   p. <num value="165">165</num>.</NOTE>
occupies the site of the tower, commonly called <QUOTE>Greenwich Castle,</QUOTE> which was built by Duke Humphrey.   This tower was repaired, in <datestruct value="1526--"><year reg="1526">1526</year></datestruct>, by Henry VIII., and was used sometimes as a habitation for the younger branches of the royal family, sometimes as a prison, occasionally as a place of defence, and at other times as a residence for a favourite mistress. <QUOTE>The king</QUOTE> (Henry VIII.), writes Puttenham, in his <QUOTE>Art of English Poesy,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>having Flamock with him in his barge, going from Westminster to Greenwich, to visit a fayre lady whom the king loved, who was lodged in the tower in the park; the king coming within sight of the tower, and being disposed to be merrie, said,  <Q>Flamock, let us run.</Q> </QUOTE> We do not know what was the result of the king's running, or what was its immediate object.   In <datestruct value="1482--"><year reg="1482">1482</year></datestruct>, Mary of York, <num value="5">fifth</num> daughter of Edward IV., died in this tower. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth it was called <QUOTE>Mirefleur,</QUOTE> and the Earl of Leicester was confined in it, when he had incurred the Queen's displeasure by marrying the Countess of Essex. Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton, Lord Privy Seal, and the founder of Norfolk College,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="196">196</num>.</NOTE> in East Greenwich, had a grant of this tower from James I.; he is said to have enlarged and beautified the building, and to have made it his principal residence.   In <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>, Elizabeth, Countess of Suffolk, died here.   <num value="10">Ten</num> years later, being then called <QUOTE>Greenwich Castle,</QUOTE> it was considered of so much importance as a place of defence, that the Parliament took immediate measures to secure it against the King. 
   <P>After the Restoration, M. de St. Pierre, a Frenchman, who came to London about the year <datestruct value="1675"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, having applied to King Charles II. to be rewarded for his discovery of a method of finding the longitude by the moon's distance from a star, a commission was appointed to investigate his pretensions.   Lord Brouncker, President of the then young Royal Society, Sir Christopher Wren, the Surveyor-General, and City architect--for nearly half London was then in ruins-Sir Jonas Moore, Master of Ordnance, and many other <QUOTE>ingenious gentlemen</QUOTE> about the town and court, composed the board, <QUOTE>with power to add to their number,</QUOTE> which power they exercised by the addition of a certain Mr. John Flamsteed, who was introduced by Sir Jonas Moore, and whose name, from that day to this, has been associated with this hill. 
   <P>Flamsteed, who was born at Denby, Derbyshire, in <datestruct value="1646--"><year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct>, had already distinguished himself as an astronomer; for, previous to the erection of this Observatory, he had made sundry observations of the heavenly bodies in a turret of the building called the <QUOTE>White   Tower,</QUOTE> in the Tower of London, which turret is still called the <QUOTE>Observatory.</QUOTE> On hearing the Frenchman's proposals, Flamsteed at once pointed out their impracticability, in consequence of the imperfect state of the tables representing the motions of the moon, and the inaccuracies of the existing catalogues of the fixed stars.   He likewise set to work on some observations of his own, which at once frustrated the schemes of St. Pierre, who was no more heard of. The commissioners thereupon communicated the results of Flamsteed's observations to the king; <QUOTE>his Majesty is startled by the assertion that the stars' places are erroneously known, and exclaims, with his childish vehemence, that  <Q>he nlust have them anew observed, examined, and corrected for the use of his seamen.</Q>  The.king is then told how necessary it is to have a good stock of observations of the moon and planets, and he exclaims that  <Q> he must have it done;</Q>  and when he is asked who could or who should do it, he replies,  <Q> The person who informs you of them.</Q> </QUOTE> Sir Jonas Moore --accordingly conveys to the young astronomer the royal warrant appointing him <QUOTE>Our Astronomical Observator,</QUOTE> and enjoining him <QUOTE>forthwith to apply himself with the utmost care and diligence to the rectifying the tables of the motions of the heavens and the places of the fixed stars, so as to find out <pb id="P.213" n="213"> the so-much-desired longitude of places, for the perfecting the art of navigation.</QUOTE> For this important service he was to receive the munificent stipend of <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> per annum! 
   <P>The next thing to be settled was the site of the 
<LEMMA id="lemma.213.1">Observatory</LEMMA>, and, upon the advice of Sir Christopher Wren, Greenwich Hill was chosen. The old tower was accordingly ordered to be demolished; and the <num value="1">first</num> stone of the new building was laid in <datestruct VALUE="1675-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>. In exactly a year from   that date the edifice was handed over to Flamsteed, and from him it acquired the name of Flamsteed House. In the following month he began his observations, with a sextant of <num value="6">six</num> feet radius, contrived by himself, and such other instruments as were then known.   Notwithstanding his scanty income, and the difficulty he experienced in obtaining such instruments as he required, Flamsteed's zeal overcame all obstacles, and during his lifetime the Observatory rose to that <num value="1">first</num> rank which it has ever since maintained among similar institutions. 
   <P>It may be worth while to consider here what was the state of practical astronomy at the time when Flamsteed commenced his labours. Neither telescopes nor clocks had yet been introduced into observatories; the star catalogue of Tycho Brahe was derived from observations made with instruments furnished with plain sights; and this, together with the Rudolphine tables of the sun, moon, and planets then known (which were constructed from elements quite as rough), were the only materials existing for the use of the theoretical astronomer.   Flamsteed, who knew   what was needed, and who had a much better idea than any man of his time of the means necessary for producing comparatively good observations, set about his task with vigour. He was totally unprovided with instruments at the public expense, but he brought with him to the Observatory an iron sextant of <num value="6">six</num> feet radius, and <num value="2">two</num> clocks, given him by Sir Jonas Moore, together with a quadrant of <num value="3">three</num> feet radius, and <num value="2">two</num> telescopes, which he had brought with him from Denby. With these instruments he worked till the year <datestruct value="1678"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct>, when he borrowed from the Royal Society a quadrant of <num value="50">fifty</num> inches, which, however, he was allowed to retain only a short time.   It must be borne in mind that the advantages of the system of meridian observations were unknown, or nearly so, at this time. The sextant was employed to measure the distances of an object to be observed from some standard stars, or stars whose places were supposed to be better known, and a laborious calculation was necessary to deduce the resulting place of the body in every instance. This gave, however, no means of fixing the place of the body with respect to the equinox; and Flamsteed, finding the absolute necessity for an instrument fixed in the plane of the meridian, applied to the Government.   He was not denied; but being wearied with repeated promises which were never kept, he at length resolved to make a <QUOTE>mural arc</QUOTE> at his own expense, and this instrument was finally erected, and divided with his own hands in <datestruct value="1683--"><year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>. It was, however, a failure; and his observations were continued for several years longer with the sextant. The minor obstructions and vexations to which Flamsteed was subjected we have not space to mention. It is sufficient to say that, during the whole time that he officiated as Astronomer-Royal (nearly half a century from his <num value="1">first</num> appointment), he was not supplied by the Government with a single instrument. The only assistance he was furnished with was that of <QUOTE>a silly, surly labourer</QUOTE> to assist him with the sextant; the other assistants and computers he provided at his own expense. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1684--"><year reg="1684">1684</year></datestruct> Flamsteed was presented to the living of Burstow, in Surrey; having been from his early life desirous of devoting himself to the duties of the ministry. <QUOTE>My desires,</QUOTE> he says, in his <QUOTE>Autobiography,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>have always been to learning and divinity; and though I have been accidentally put from it by God's providence, yet I had always thought myself more qualified for it than for any other employment, because my bodily weakness will not permit me action, and my mind has always been fitted for the contemplation of God and his works.</QUOTE> His father died a few years afterwards; and these <num value="2">two</num> circumstances improving his estate, he determined to construct a new <QUOTE>mural arc,</QUOTE> stronger than the former; and this instrument, famous as really commencing a new era in observing, was constructed by Mr. Abraham Sharp, his friend and assistant, at an expense of <measure value="120l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="120">120</num></measure>, no portion of which was reimbursed to him by the Government. All Flamsteed's former observations were of little value; no fundamental point of astronomy was settled by them; and they merely served for forming a preliminary or observing catalogue of objects to be well observed with his new instrument. From the date of the use of this instrument, <datestruct value="1689--"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>, the useful labours of Flamsteed commenced; every observation made after this was permanently useful, and could be applied to determine some important point. With this instrument, after verifying its position and determining its adjustment, he set about the determination of those cardinal points in astronomy, the position of the equinox, the obliquity of the ecliptic, and other fundamentals, without which the correct positions <pb id="P.214" n="214"> of the fixed stars and the planetary bodies could never be ascertained. His methods and processes are explained by himself in the <QUOTE>Historia Coelestis,</QUOTE> a work in <num value="3">three</num> folio volumes, the <num value="3">third</num> of which contains his catalogue of <num value="2935">2,935</num> stars, carried down to the year <datestruct value="1689"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>.   His work still holds a high place in the history of astronomy. 
    <P>What instruments Flamsteed had to work with, then, we are assured he had to provide and pay for himself; and in order to do this, he was compelled to turn <QUOTE>teacher.</QUOTE> Government had already imposed upon him the education, monthly, of <num value="2">two</num> boys from   Christ's Hospital, as if his tedious watches by night, and his laborious calculations by day, were not sufficient return for his paltry pittance, which was reduced by a tax to <measure value="90l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="90">90</num></measure> a year.   He thereupon, as we have said, gave lessons in his favourite science, and obtained for pupils sundry dukes and lords, with many captains of vessels and East India servants, thus augmenting his pecuniary means. 
   <P>Flamsteed appears soon to have made many friends, among whom   was the venerable John Evelyn, who, under date of <datestruct VALUE="1676-09-10"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=10>10th</day>, <year reg=1676>1676</year></datestruct>, makes this entry in his <QUOTE>Diary:</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>Din'd with me Mr. Flamsted, the learned astrologer <hi rend=italics>(sic</hi>) and mathematician, whom his Majesty had established in the new Observatory in Greenwich Park, with the choicest instruments.   An   honest, sincere man.</QUOTE> Evelyn, we need scarcely state, should have written <QUOTE>astronomer,</QUOTE> instead of <QUOTE><LEMMA id="lemma.214.1">astrologer</LEMMA>.</QUOTE> But he is not the only person who has made this confusion. For it is a fact worthy of being placed on record that seldom a week passes without ladies driving from London in their carriages to the doors of the Observatory, and inquiring if they can have their <QUOTE>horoscopes</QUOTE> cast, evidently showing that they do not know the difference between astrology and astronomy. It is to be feared that on this subject great superstition prevails, even among the <QUOTE>educated</QUOTE> classes; and that whilst fortune-tellers, who practise on poor servant-girls, are pounced upon by the police, some of the professors of the secret science, called <QUOTE>spiritualism,</QUOTE> are making fortunes, by charging a guinea for every consultation, or <hi rend=italics>seance</hi>! But we must now return to our subject. On the <datestruct VALUE="1680-06-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>, John Evelyn writes :-- <QUOTE>Came to dine Dr. Burnet, author of the  <Q> History of the Reformation.</Q>  After dinner we all went to see the Observatory and Mr. Flamsteed, who show'd us divers rare instruments, especially the greate quadrant.   My old friend Henshaw was with me.</QUOTE> Again, some <num value="3">three</num> years later, namely, on the <datestruct VALUE="1683-08-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>, we meet with this entry:-- <QUOTE>Came to see me Mr. Flamsted, the astronomer, from his Observatorie at Greenwich, to draw the meridian for my pendule,</QUOTE> &amp;c. 
    <P>About this time, or shortly after, Flamsteed became friendly with Sir Isaac Newton, who was engaged in investigating the irregularities of the moon's motions, for the confirmation of his theory of universal gravitation, and who required accurate observations of the moon for comparison of fact with fancy. No <num value="1">one</num> but Flamsteed could supply these, and from time to time Newton visited him in order to obtain them. But this friendship was not of long duration. A difference arose between them, on account of an innocent statement by  Flamsteed, to the effect that he had furnished  Newton with a mass of lunar observations to assist him in his investigations, getting into print. Some angry correspondence ensued, and the dispute, after slumbering for a few years, broke out into a lamentable quarrel.   In course of time, Flamsteed's valuable store of observations, extending over the period of <num value="30">thirty</num> years which he had then passed as Astronomer-Royal, were prepared for publication. Prince George of Denmark, consort of Queen Anne, undertook to bear the expense of printing; and a committee, with Sir C. Wren and  Newton among the number, was appointed to examine the manuscript, and see the work through the press. During its progress, the latent quarrel between Flamsteed and Newton broke out afresh, and arrived at its culmination, turning upon the difference that existed between Flamsteed and the referees concerning the plan of publication of his work. The book, <QUOTE>mangled and garbled,</QUOTE> was at length published, and so much did it annoy its author, that when, a few years after, the undistributed copies, about <num value="3">three</num>-fourths of the entire impression, were placed in his hands, he at once committed the whole of them to the flames, <QUOTE>as a sacrifice to heavenly truth,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>that none may exist to show the ingratitude of <num value="2">two</num> of his countrymen, who had used him worse than ever the noble  Tycho was used in Denmark.</QUOTE> He then resolved to publish a complete edition of his observations on his own plan, and at his own expense. It was to appear in <num value="3">three</num> volumes; but on the completion of the <num value="2">second</num> volume, his life's weary toil was brought to a close, on the last day of the year  <datestruct value="1719"><year reg="1719">1719</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>Flamsteed was succeeded by Dr. Halley, an astronomer also of great eminence, who, finding upon his appointment that the Observatory was destitute both of furniture and instruments (Flamsteed's having been removed by his executors as his personal property), furnished it anew, and fixed a transit instrument.   Its introduction is stated to <pb id="P.215" n="215"> have been the most important step that had been made. It is the most simple and effective of all astronomical instruments; and up to the present time, the only changes that have been made in the means for observing the right ascensions of the heavenly bodies, are those which secure to it the utmost possible stability and accuracy of workmanship and adjustment.   With it alone Halley continued to make observations of the moon till the year   <datestruct value="1725"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>, when an <num value="8">eight</num>-foot mural quadrant, made by Graham, was set up at the public expense. Of the small salary received by Dr. Halley for his important duties the following anecdote has been related :--On the accession of George II., the queen consort, Caroline, made a visit to the Royal Observatory. Being pleased with everything she saw, and understanding the smallness of the astronomer's salary (<measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> per annum), her Majesty very graciously said she would speak to the king to have it augmented, to which Dr. Halley replied in alarm, <QUOTE>Pray, your Majesty, do no such thing; for should the salary be increased, it might become an object of emolument to place there some unqualified needy dependant, to the ruin of the institution.</QUOTE> However, understanding that the doctor had formerly served the Crown as a captain in the navy, the queen soon after was able to obtain a grant of his half-pay for that commission, which he accordingly enjoyed from that time up to the end of his life. 
   <P>Halley died in <datestruct value="1742--"><year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct>, and his successor was 
<LEMMA id="lemma.215.1">Dr. Bradley</LEMMA>. This eminent astronomer made a noble series of observations, extending over the <num value="20">twenty</num> years during which he held the post. In <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct> many valuable additions were made to the stock of instruments. Bradley died in the year <datestruct value="1762"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, and was succeeded by Dr. Bliss, who lived only till <datestruct VALUE="1764-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1764">1764</year></datestruct>. The office next devolved upon <LEMMA id="lemma.215.2">Dr. Maskelyne</LEMMA>, who for nearly <num value="50">fifty</num> years performed the duties with wonderful assiduity; scarcely ever leaving the Observatory, except on some important scientific business, and making all the laborious and delicate observations himself, although he had the co-operation of a skilful assistant. He <num value="1">first</num> suggested the publication of the <hi rend=italics>Nautical Almanack</hi>, a work of indispensable use to seamen, of which he edited no less than <num value="49">forty-nine</num> volumes. At his death he left <num value="4">four</num> large folio volumes of printed observations as the result of the patient labour of his life.   In <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct> an order was issued by George III. that the observations made at Greenwich should be published, under the superintendence of the Royal Society; they have, accordingly, since been published annually by that learned body.   The principal addition made to the Observatory during Maskelyne's directorship was the building of the <QUOTE>circle</QUOTE> room, contiguous to and east of the transit-room. Maskelyne died in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, leaving behind him an enviable reputation. The observations made by this astronomer during his <num value="47">forty-seven</num> years' residence at Greenwich were so valuable, that it has been remarked of him by his biographer, that if the whole materials of science should be lost except the volume of observations left by him, they would suffice to reconstruct the edifice of modern astronomy.   He was succeeded by Mr. John Pond, who held office till the year <datestruct value="1835"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct>, when ill health compelled him   to resign; he died in the following year, and was buried at Lee, in the same tomb with his predecessor, Dr. Halley.   During Mr. Pond's directorship the Observatory acquired that organisation which it has since retained, and which was necessary to enable it to meet the demand made upon it by the requirements of modern science.   On his entrance upon his duties he began, like his predecessors, with <num value="1">one</num> assistant; but on his representations and urgent entreaties for increase of the establishment, he finally obtained <num value="6">six</num> assistants; and this amount of force for the astronomical department of the Observatory has been continued with some modifications to the present time.   Pond was peculiarly skilful in the theory of astronomical instruments, and in the interpretation of the results afforded by them. Sir George Airy, in <num value="1">one</num> of his official reports, states that he regards him as the <QUOTE>principal improver of modern practical astronomy.</QUOTE> 
    <P>On the resignation of Mr. Pond, Mr. George  Biddell Airy, then Director of the Observatory at  Cambridge, was appointed to the vacant office. <QUOTE>Under his presidency,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Carpenter, in the <title>Gentleman's Magazine</title> (<datestruct VALUE="1866-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE>the  Observatory has been gradually augmented and brought to its present complete and perfect condition. Old instruments, very perfect in their way, but still behind modern requirements, have been laid aside, and new systems introduced.   Every improvement that modern science could supply, and every appliance that modern mechanical skill could suggest, have been made subservient to the utilitarian principles of the Observatory under its present organisation.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Greenwich Observatory has little to recommend it as a building. It was never intended for show, but for work.   It was constructed in haste, chiefly with the materials of the old tower, and some spare bricks that lay available at Tilbury Fort, The admissions to the building are strictly limited to such individuals as are most likely to be benefited by visiting it, and idling sightseers are carefully <pb id="P.216" n="216"> excluded. A card is kept in the porter's lodge, which explains that the privilege of visiting the Observatory is of necessity very limited, those officially privileged being officers of the Royal Navy and gentlemen officially connected with the Admiralty; other visitors are required to be furnished with an introduction from   some person of scientific distinction. 
   <P>A few objects arrest attention outside the walls of the edifice.   For instance, the <num value="24">twenty-four</num> hour electric clock, supposed by the uninitiated to be kept going by the sun; the public barometer, with its indices, showing the highest and lowest readings during the past few hours; the little windmill like a child's toy on the roof; and the high pole with a light at the top, conjectured to be a beacon to show the longitude at sea.   <num value="1">One</num> other external object must not be   overlooked: this is an iron plate fixed against the wall, with a number of brass plugs and pins projecting from it, with the inscriptions, <QUOTE>British Yard,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE><num value="2">Two</num> Feet,</QUOTE> &amp;c., over them. <QUOTE>It will probably be asked,</QUOTE> says Mr. Carpenter, in an article in the <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Maagazine</hi>, from which we have already quoted, <QUOTE>what has a yard-measure to do with astronomy? It has a great deal. <num value="1">One</num> important branch of practical astronomy is the measurement of time, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.216" n="2000.14.0079"><HEAD>Flamsteed House.   (From Hollar's <title>Long View</title>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 and time is the only natural standard this earth possesses; it is the only thing that is invariable. Now the British imperial standard yard, by law established, is a measure of length, bearing a certain definite proportion to the length of a pendulum which, at a given temperature and under other specified conditions, beats accurately   <hi rend=italics>seconds of mean solar time</hi>. This is the connection between astronomy and yard-measures.   Any <num value="1">one</num> who desires to secure an accurate yard-measure may do so by carrying to Greenwich a rod about a yard long, and truly adjusting it by means of the appliance there exposed for the public benefit. He will find <num value="2">two</num> plugs, the distance between which is exactly a yard when the temperature of the air is about <num value="60">60</num>, and <num value="2">two</num> pins for the support of the rod to be adjusted. The plugs are bevelled off a little on their insides, and the points that are exactly a yard apart are marked upon their upper surfaces by arrow-heads.   If the rod will not go in as far as the arrow-heads, it is too long; if it passes them loosely, it is too short. Similar plugs are provided for shorter measures, down to <num value="3">three</num> inches.</QUOTE> 
   <P>On passing inside the gate, the <num value="1">first</num> object that presents itself is a range of low buildings immediately to the left, railed off from the more common portions of the court. The old-fashioned yet rather <pb id="P.217" n="217"> picturesque gables and roughly-tiled roofs of these buildings, and their general humble aspect, give no evidence of their use, except what may be gathered from the slits, closed by shutters, which in <num value="2">two</num> places intersect them, and the domes that flank them   at their eastern and south-western extremities; yet in these unpretending rooms not only are all the observations made which give its fame to the establishment, but the reduction of them   is also performed there, and they are rendered fit for the immediate use of the astronomer. The door immediately opposite, as we cross the court, is that of the Astronomer-Royal's residence, all the apartments of which are on the groundfloor, and situated on either side of a long gallery running nearly east and west.   On the wall of the building, near this doorway, is a slab containing the original inscription set up at the erection of the Observatory; it is as follows:--

 A doorway near the eastern end of the range of buildings leads into the transit-circle room, <num value="1">one</num> of the principal observing-rooms of the establishment. To the reader not familiar with the instruments and processes of astronomy it may be desirable to explain that the transit-instrument is a telescope which is supposed   theoretically to describe the plane of the meridian. For this special purpose it is furnished with <num value="2">two</num> axes, terminating in <num value="2">two</num> wellpolished equal cylindrical pivots; and these pivots being placed in bearings sunk in the stone piers shaped like the letter Y (technically called <QUOTE>Y&lsquo;s</QUOTE> ), the instrument is capable of revolving freely. 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.217.1">Admiral Superintendent's Office</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>We may here remark that the principal duty of the practical astronomer is the determination of right ascensions and polar distances. <QUOTE>Right ascension,</QUOTE> says Mr. Carpenter, <QUOTE>is the distance of a heavenly body from an imaginary point-or, more properly, a great circle passing through a point --in the heavens, called the <num value="1">first</num> point of Aries. It is a well-known fact that the earth completes <num value="1">one</num> revolution upon its axis in the course of twentyfour hours; and this rotation   affords a ready means of measuring right ascension.   We have only to ascertain how much the earth turns between <pb id="P.218" n="218"> the time that the <num value="1">first</num> point of Aries crosses the meridian, and the time that the star to be measured crosses it. To measure this <num value="2">two</num> things are requisite--a clock, and something like a line to see the stars pass over.   . . A telescope is firmly fixed to a horizontal axis, and mounted upon <num value="2">two</num> stone pillars, just as a gun is mounted upon its trunnions, free to move vertically, but incapable of moving horizontally. The telescope is so adjusted, that upon spinning it round, it sweeps out an imaginary plane which lies exactly due north or south of the Observatory.   In its focus is placed an extremely fine vertical line--in reality, a fragment of spider's web.   Now, to whatever point of the heavens we direct this telescope, bearing in mind that it can only move in a vertical direction, that spider-line represents the astronomical meridian at that point. The virtual meridian of Greenwich is therefore really no more than half an inch of cobweb.   If, then, we take a clock, and set it at oh. om. os. when the <num value="1">first</num> point of Aries crosses the meridian, it will be obvious that the time by that clock, when any object passes the spider-line in the telescope, will be its distance from that point expressed in time; for instance, if we direct the telescope to a star that we see approaching the meridian, and observe that it crosses the cobweb at <num value="5">5</num>h. <num value="21">21</num>m. <measure value="45s." type=currency><num value="45">45</num>s.</measure>, we know, assuming the clock to be correct, and the instrument in proper adjustment, that the right ascension of the star is <num value="5">5</num>h. <num value="21">21</num>m. <measure value="45s." type=currency><num value="45">45</num>s.</measure>   From the circumstance of all objects crossing or transiting the field of this telescope, it bears the very appropriate title of the  <Q>Transit Instrument.</Q>  It was invented by Romer, a Danish astronomer, about the year <datestruct value="1690"><year reg="1690">1690</year></datestruct>, and was <num value="1">first</num> used at the Greenwich Observatory by Halley some <num value="30">thirty</num> years after.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Upon the same wall on which hangs Halley's primitive instrument, are suspended <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> other transit instruments, which in their time have doubtless rendered good service to astronomical science. These are the instruments introduced by Dr. Bradley, and also Troughton's noble instrument, used by Maskelyne and Pond, and by the present Astronomer-Royal up to the year <datestruct value="1850"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>, when it was dismounted to give place to the gigantic <QUOTE>transit-circle</QUOTE> now in use.   This lastmentioned instrument is, in fact, a combination of <num value="2">two</num> instruments, seeing that it has also superseded the <QUOTE>mural quadrant,</QUOTE> by means of which a star or planet's polar distance was formerly ascertained. This instrument is <num value="12">twelve</num> feet in length, and its largest glass is <num value="8">eight</num> inches in diameter. Attached to the telescope is the circle which answers to the <QUOTE>mural circle</QUOTE> around its circumference is a narrow band of silver, upon which are engraved those divisions representing degrees of angular measurement, of which the whole circle contains <num value="360">360</num>.   These degrees are further subdivided into smaller intervals of <num value="5">five</num> minutes, and the intermediate minutes and seconds, and decimals of a <num value="2">second</num>, are what is technically termed <QUOTE>read off</QUOTE> by means of micrometers, <num value="6">six</num> of which are used, and their mean taken, to eliminate errors of observation, &amp;c.   These micrometers are affixed to <num value="1">one</num> of the piers supporting the instrument, the pier itself being perforated to allow the divisions to be seen through it.   Another circle attached to the telescope is a clamping circle, for the purpose of fixing the instrument rigidly during an observation.   Counterpoises in various parts, apparatus for raising the instrument, and other appliances necessary for purposes of adjustment, make up the other details of the <QUOTE>transit circle,</QUOTE> in front of which stands the <QUOTE>transit clock,</QUOTE> which is its indispensable accessory. 
   <P>We have arrived, let us suppose, a little before noon; the sun is about to cross the meridian, and an observation is to be made.   Shutters in the roof are thrown open, the great telescope is swung up and fixed in position, and an observer seats himself at the lower end of it. Peeping through the instrument, all that could be seen by an <QUOTE>outside</QUOTE> observer would be a number of vertical lines, technically called <QUOTE>wires,</QUOTE> but in reality so many pieces of cobweb, as mentioned above, stretched across the field of observation at irregular distances. The centre <num value="1">one</num> is the celebrated meridian of Greenwich, or, at all events, it represents it, and it is curious to reflect that from this centre line ships of all civilised nations, and in all parts of the known world, are reckoning their distances.   What the regular observer has to do is to record the precise instant at which the sun's edge, or <QUOTE>limb,</QUOTE> as astronomers call it, passes that central <QUOTE>wire.</QUOTE> In any single observation, however, he may be a little at fault, and for the sake of greater accuracy, therefore, he notes the instant at which it passes over all the <QUOTE>wires,</QUOTE> and then strikes an average between them.   Slowly the sun creeps up to the <num value="1">first</num> line, and the observer lightly taps a little spring attached to the telescope.   The <num value="2">second</num> <QUOTE>wire</QUOTE> is reached, and again the spring is tapped, and so on throughout the whole <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="9">nine</num> webs employed in the observation.   This spring is connected with a telegraphic wire extending to a <QUOTE>chronograph</QUOTE> in a distant part of the building, which consists of a cylinder, around which a sheet of white paper has been strained. The cylinder itself is revolved by the pendulum   of an electric clock, which, instead <pb id="P.219" n="219"> of oscillating backwards and forwards, swings round in a circle, thus producing a motion perfectly uniform and unbroken.   A little steel point, which is travelling over the surface of the paper, is in electric communication with the spring attached to the great telescope; <QUOTE>and,</QUOTE> observes a writer in 
<hi rend=italics>Cassell's Family Magazine, </hi> <QUOTE>every time the observer taps the spring, this little travelling point pricks into the paper, thus recording that the sun has just crossed a  <Q>wire.</Q>    This in itself, however, would not be a record of the time of transit if it were not that another little steel point, which is in connection with a galvanic clock in another part of the building, has previously marked the sheet of paper into spaces representing precise seconds of time.   On the completion of the observation the paper may be removed from   the cylinder, and affords a permanent record of it.</QUOTE> 
    <P><num value="1">One</num> other object in the apartment containing the <QUOTE>transit-circle</QUOTE> should not be passed unnoticed; it is the identical instrument with which Bradley made his important discovery of the aberration of light. 
    <P>The next important instrument is the altitude and azimuth, or, as it is termed, for shortness, the <QUOTE>altazimuth,</QUOTE> which is located in the south dome of the Observatory buildings. This instrument was erected in <datestruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></datestruct>, for the sole purpose of observing the moon.   Next to the sun, the most important of the heavenly bodies is the moon, for, independently of her use in regulating the division of the year into months, and creating the tides of the ocean, she is indispensable to nautical science, as her motions afford the only means of accurately determining the longitude at sea. The Observatory was originally founded for observations necessary to bring to perfection the lunar tables, and for the improvement of nautical astronomy.  The observation of the moon in every part of her orbit has always been, therefore, an object of <num value="1">first</num>-rate importance.   To effect this, meridian observations have been regularly made in fixed observatories, as alone giving results of the requisite excellence. But, since the moon is invisible at her meridian passage for nearly <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3">third</num> of her orbit --viz., for about <num value="4">four</num> days, on the average, before conjunction, and for <num value="4">four</num> days after it-and since also a great many observations in each lunation are necessarily lost by cloudy weather, it became a great desideratum to supply, if possible, by extrameridional observations, these defects. The altitude and azimuthal instrument was evidently the kind of instrument that must be employed for this purpose, because, its axes being <num value="1">one</num> horizontal and the other vertical, the parts of the instrument are equally affected by gravity in every position, and the only thing wanted to produce observations which should rival those made with the transitinstrument and mural-circle, would be sufficient firmness.   To secure this the Astronomer-Royal adopted as his principles of construction, <QUOTE>to form as many parts as possible in <num value="1">one</num> cast of metal, to use no small screws in the union of parts, and to have no power of adjustment in any.</QUOTE> The instrument is, therefore, as the visitor would at once see, of unusual weight and solidity. <num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> vertical cheeks that are on each side of the telescope carries, in <num value="1">one</num> cast of metal, the <num value="4">four</num> microscopes for reading the vertical circle, and the supports of the levels parallel to the plane of that circle. The lower piece connecting these cheeks, or the base plate, carries in <num value="1">one</num> cast the <num value="4">four</num> microscopes for reading the horizontal or azimuthal circle, and supports <num value="2">two</num> levels parallel to the horizontal axis; and the upper connecting piece carries <num value="2">two</num> other levels similarly situated on the upper pivot. These pieces are most firmly connected with the side vertical cheeks by means of planed surfaces and screw bolts.   The vertical circle was made in <num value="2">two</num> casts of metal-viz., the cylindrical part, the spokes and pivots on <num value="1">one</num> side, the object-end and the eye-end of the telescope were made in <num value="1">one</num> cast; and in the other cast are included the spokes and pivot on the other side. Thus the whole of the essential parts of the instrument, with regard to firmness, were made in <num value="6">six</num> casts of metal. The weight of these <num value="6">six</num> parts is about <num value="16">sixteen</num> hundredweight. 
   <P>Some idea of the importance of the Greenwich lunar observations may be inferred from the circumstance that, during the century ending with the year <datestruct value="1851"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>, Greenwich contributed nearly <num value="12000">12,000</num> observations of the moon towards the improvement and perfection of the vexatious lunar theory; all reduced under the direction of Sir G. B. Airy, and rendered immediately available for the investigations of the physical astronomer, the lunar tables now in use being chiefly based upon these observations. Since the introduction of the <QUOTE>altazimuth,</QUOTE> the number of observations of the moon formerly made here in the course of each year has been about doubled, and, as a natural consequence, the value of the Greenwich lunar observations has been largely increased. 
   <P>It may be asked by some of our readers, how are the Greenwich observations of the moon connected with navigation? A few lines by the author quoted above may be given as a reply. <QUOTE>The observing astronomer,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE>observes accurately the position of the moon in the heavens at <pb id="P.220" n="220"> all times and under all circumstances. He turns his observations over to the physical astronomer. The physical astronomer deduces from them the laws that govern the moon's motions, and represents those motions by numerical tables. These tables are put into the hands of the computer of the <hi rend=italics>Nautical Almanac</hi>, who, by their aid, predicts the place the moon will occupy, with reference to proximate stars and otherwise, at every hour of the day and night throughout the year, and publishes these <Q>lunar distances</Q> in that work, <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> years in advance, for the benefit of seamen starting on long voyages. The mariner observes the moon and stars near her with his sextant, and from comparison of his observations with the positions given in the <title>Nautical Almanac</title>
computes his longitude, and ascertains the place of his vessel on the trackless ocean.</QUOTE> 
   <P>We will now pass on to the interior of the very large dome, or rather drum, that caps the southeastern extremity of the Observatory. In it is a magnificent specimen of the class of instrument known as the <QUOTE>equatorial.</QUOTE> The dome itself, which has an opening closed by curved shutters, sliding upwards and downwards, moves round with sufficient ease by means of a toothed wheel and rack, the manual power being applied at the ends of long radial bars. <QUOTE>The great equatorial telescope was mounted about the year <datestruct value="1860"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, under the direction and from the plans of the present Astronomer-Royal.</QUOTE> The author whom we have already quoted remarks that, <QUOTE>It is the largest instrument in the Observatory, and of its kind is <num value="1">one</num> of the finest in the world. Its object-glass, which is <num value="13">thirteen</num> inches in diameter, and has a focal distance of eighteen feet, alone cost <measure value="1200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1200">1,200</num></measure>. The most curious feature in this telescope is the clockwork arrangement by which it follows any object under examination. It is used chiefly for what may be called gazing purposes-such, for instance, as the scrutiny of the marvellous eruptions on the surface of the sun, or the mountains of the moon, and it is often necessary to continue such observations for hours together.   It is plain, however, that if an observer is examining the face of the sun, the motion of the earth will gradually bear him   and his telescope eastward until the great luminary is lost to view. He will steadily creep out at the western side of the field. This is obviated by the operation of a clock driven by falling water. This powerful piece of mechanism is connected with the great iron framework supporting the telescope, and just as the earth creeps round from west to east, the telescope and all that pertains to it is borne round from east to west. Thus, so far as the motion of the earth is concerned, the sun, moon, or stars, as seen through the great equatorial, will appear to be perfectly stationary.</QUOTE> 
   <P>We have now   seen all the more prominent features of the astronomical department of Greenwich Observatory, though there yet remain many other objects of the utmost scientific interestsuch as rain-gauges, hygrometers, anemometers, and thermometers, placed in all kinds of positions, and under all kinds of conditions. In <num value="1">one</num> room is a very large number of Government chronometers, required for the use of ships; while in a building apart from the Astronomical Observatory, is a Magnetic Observatory, established about the year <datestruct value="1840"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, for the purpose of ascertaining and recording the various phenomena of the magnetic currents of the earth. <QUOTE>The principal instruments in the Magnetic Observatory,</QUOTE> writes Mr. J. Carpenter, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>are <num value="3">three</num> magnets about <num value="2">two</num> feet long, <num value="1">one</num> suspended by a skein of silk fibres, in the plane of the magnetic meridian, for indicating the variation in declination of the needle; another, suspended by <num value="2">two</num> silk skeins, at right angles to the meridian, for indicating the earth's horizontal magnetic force; and a <num value="3">third</num>, poised upon knife edges, like a scale-beam, for showing the vertical magnetic force.   In order to secure as uniform a temperature as possible, these instruments are mounted in a subterranean apartment.   Until the year <datestruct value="1847"><year reg="1847">1847</year></datestruct> it was customary to observe the positions of these magnets every <num value="2">two</num> hours throughout the day and night, but it afterwards became evident that some mode of perpetual registration of their movements was absolutely necessary, and a reward of <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> was offered for some system by which this could be effected. The reward was gained by Mr. Brooke, a medical gentleman of London, who so completely solved the problem by the skilful application of photography that his method has ever since been used with perfect success in this and other magnetic observatories, entirely superseding the old system of eye-observation. The simple process is as follows :--Each magnet has a concave mirror affixed to it in such a manner that every deflection of the magnet deflects the mirror also. A gas-burner is so placed that a beam of light from it is always shining upon the mirror. At some distance from the magnet is a cylinder, around which is wrapped a sheet of photographic paper.   The beam of gaslight falling on the mirror is reflected, as a little spot of light, on to the paper, and as the magnet moves the spot of light changes its position on the sheet, leaving its trail wherever it goes. The cylinder is made to revolve <pb id="P.221" n="221"> once in <num value="24">twenty-four</num> hours, and the magnet thus records, night and day, its minute changes of position. <num value="2">Two</num> magnets trace   their movements upon the same sheet of paper, which is changed every morning, and the latent image brought out, or  <Q>developed,</Q>  in the usual way.   Across the centre of the sheet runs a fine straight line, called the <hi rend=italics>base line</hi>, its place relative to the traces of the magnets serving as a zero from which the various positions of the magnet during the day are measured, the time being ascertained by a time-scale laid down on each sheet.   In a similar manner the movements of delicate galvano-meters, placed in the circuits of long lines of telegraph wires with  <Q>earth-plates' (masses of metal buried in the earth) at their extremities, register the fluctuations of those mysterious galvanic currents that are constantly circulating through the earth, and to which the name of </Q> earth-currents' has been given.   The height of the barometer and   the changes of temperature during the day and night are simply recorded by photography. In the case of the barometer, this is effected by means of a float on the surface of the mercury in a syphon tube, which, as it rises and falls, raises or lowers a diaphragm with a small hole pierced through it, allowing the light from an adjacent gas-flame to fall upon the sensitive paper, which is, in this case, wrapped around a vertical revolving cylinder.   In the case of thermometers, the gas-light is allowed to shine through the glass tube upon the passing paper, and the mercury, rising and falling, serves as a shutter that cuts off the light at various heights corresponding to the various temperatures. 
    <P>Here we see the use of the high pole with a light at the summit, that so mystifies the outer world. It is for the purpose of supporting a wire that is suspended from its top to the summit of the Astronomical Observatory. This wire collects electricity from the atmosphere, and conducts it down another wire to the room beneath, where, by means of appropriate electrometers, its quantity is measured and its quality ascertained. The light at the mast-head is for the purpose of preserving the apparatus in a degree of warmth and dryness essential to produce insulation, and prevent the escape of the atmospheric electricity. . . . In connection with this department we must visit the anemometers, or wind-gauges.   For this purpose it is necessary to mount to the highest point of the  Observatory. <num value="1">One</num> of these anemometers is, to all outward appearance, nothing more than a simple vane; but if we enter the turret upon which it is mounted we shall see that its motions are communicated, through a little simple machinery, to a pencil which is tracing upon a sheet of paper, moved by clockwork, every motion of the vane above; and thus recording to all futurity every change of wind throughout the day and night.   Another pencil is marking the force of the wind, or its pressure in pounds upon the square foot; while a <num value="3">third</num>, only called into use in rainy weather, shows the quantity of rain that falls and the rate of its falling. On another part of the roof is the little windmill to which we have before alluded.   This is also an anemometer; its use is to determine the <hi rend=italics>velocity</hi> of the wind, or, in other words, the length in miles of the current of air that passes over Greenwich in a given time.   It consists of <num value="4">four</num> cups, mounted upon horizontal arms attached to a vertical spindle; the rotation of the cups, which are spun round by the wind, is communicated through the spindle to a train of wheels and dials, which latter indicate the exact number of hundreds or thousands of revolutions performed by the cups, and from this the velocity of the wind is deduced. 
    <P>Here, too, we are brought into closer contact with the time-signal ball; a wood and leather sphere, <num value="5">five</num> feet in diameter, that is raised every day at <num value="5">five</num> minutes before <num value="1">one</num> o'clock, and dropped at <num value="1">one</num> precisely by the galvanic motor clock, the clock giving a signal that, by means of magnetism, pulls a trigger, and disengages the ball.</QUOTE>

    <P>Nothing, perhaps, throughout the Observatory is calculated to strike the visitor with greater astonishment than the motor clock above referred to.   There is nothing very remarkable in its appearance, but the work it accomplishes renders it, perhaps, the most wonderful clock in the world, and certainly the most important <num value="1">one</num> in England.  The writer above quoted continues-- <QUOTE>It regulates several clocks within the Observatory, as well as the large <num value="1">one</num> already referred to outside the gates; <num value="1">one</num> at Greenwich Hospital Schools, another at the London Bridge Station of the South-Eastern  Railway, another at the Post Office, St. Martin's-le-  Grand, and another in Lombard Street.   Once every day it telegraphs correct time to the great clock tower at Westminster; it drops the signalball over the Observatory, another near Charing  Cross, and <num value="1">one</num> at Deal; it fires time-guns at Shields and Newcastle, and every hour throughout the day it flashes out correct time to each of the railway companies. All this is accomplished, as it were, by the mere volition of the clock, and without any human interference whatever.   Every morning it is corrected by an actual observation of a star; and thus, without being aware of it, do we every day start our trains, and make our appointments, <pb id="P.222" n="222"> and take our meals by the motions of the heavenly bodies as observed and recorded during the preceding night.</QUOTE> 
   <P>It is no longer, therefore, <QUOTE>the Horse Guards clock,</QUOTE> but Greenwich Observatory, which regulates the time of all the clocks and watches in London.   The Post Office authorities have granted the special use of a system of electric wires to the inventors of a method for synchronising clocks. The arrangements recently completed bring the Greenwich Observatory into   direct communication with the establishment at Cornhill of Messrs. Barraud and Lund, the inventors of an apparatus by means of which existing clocks can be automatically <QUOTE>set to time.</QUOTE> The mechanism is of the simplest kind; it interferes in no way with the works of a clock, and can be applied to any timepiece in or out of doors. Any number of clocks, varying in size and calibre, can, upon receipt of <num value="1">one</num> time-signal, be simultaneously set to accord with each other in accurately denoting Greenwich time. A very small outlay, it is said, will secure true Greenwich time to every City establishment. 
   <P>An account of what has been done at the Greenwich Observatory, as well as of what is in progress, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.222" n="2000.14.0081"><HEAD>Magnetic Clock, Greenwich Observatory.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 is given in the annual report of the Astronomer- Royal, and the results are issued from   time to time in a more substantial form in the shape of such works as the Astronomer-Royal's <QUOTE>Corrections of the Elements of the Lunar Theory</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>); the <QUOTE>Greenwich Catalogue of <num value="2022">2,022</num> Stars</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct>); and <QUOTE>Catalogue of <num value="2760">2,760</num> Stars</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>).   More recently the subjects of solar photography and spectroscopy have been added to the routine investigations of the Observatory. From the annual report published in <datestruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct> we learn that the system of time-signals, originating in the Observatory and disseminated by the Post Office telegraph through the whole of England, and to Scotland and Ireland, continued to spread, and that it now appeared to be a national institution. The Lombard Street clock has been maintained in all the accuracy that is required for post-office purposes, with scarcely a failure; and the Westminster clock has been so efficiently regulated, under the check of automatic report to the Observatory, that on <num value="83">83</num> per cent. of the days of the year its error is below <num value="1">one</num> <num value="2">second</num>. In concluding his report, Sir George Airy remarks that the Observatory was expressly built for the aid of astronomy and navigation, for <pb id="p.223" n="223"> promoting methods of determining longitude at sea, and, as the circumstances that led to its formation show, more especially for determination of the moon's motions. All these imply as their <num value="1">first</num> step the formation of accurate catalogues of stars, and the determination of the fundamental elements of the solar system. These objects have been steadily pursued from the foundation of the observatoryin <num value="1">one</num> way by Flamsteed, in another way by Halley, and by Bradley in the early part of his career; in a <num value="3">third</num> form by Bradley in his later years, by Maskelyne (who contributed most powerfully to lunar and chronometric nautical astronomy), and for a time by Pond; then, with improved instruments, by Pond, and by himself (Sir G. B. Airy) for some years, and subsequently with the instruments now in use. It has been his own intention 
<FIGURE id="Fig.223" n="2000.14.0082"><HEAD>The Great Equatorial Telescope In The Dome, Greenwich Observatory.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 to maintain the principles of the long-established system in perfect integrity, varying the instruments, the modes of employing them, and the modes of utilising the observations by calculation and publication, as the progress of science might require. 
   <P>Viewing the instruments, however, now in use, and the increase of expenses, which were lower than the work done, the Astronomer-Royal expresses a hope that the National Observatory will always remain on the site where it was <num value="1">first</num> planted, and which early acquired the name of <QUOTE>Flamsteed  Hill.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The Observatory is annually inspected by a body of scientific persons of high standing, who are commissioned by the Government of the day to see that the institution is maintained in a state of efficiency. <pb id="P.224" n="224">

<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.224.1">Trinity Church, Blackheath</LEMMA></NOTE>
 
<P>Blackheath, which is divided from its aristocratic neighbour only by a wall, pleasantly overlooks a portion of the counties of Kent and Surrey, and affords such extensive views of the distant scenery as can be exceeded only by climbing Shooter's Hill, or some of the neighbouring heights on the left of the heath.   In past times it was planted with gibbets, on which the bleaching bones of men who had dared to ask for some extension of liberty, or who doubted the infallibility of kings, were left year after year to dangle in the wind. In the distance the ancient palace of Eltham   may just be seen between the trees, heaving up like a large barn against the sky. 
   <P>Blackheath--which furnishes the name to the <num value="100">hundred</num> to which it belongs-lies chiefly in the parishes of Greenwich and Lewisham, a portion, however, being in the parish, or <QUOTE>liberty,</QUOTE> of Kidbrook, while a part of Blackheath Park is in Charlton parish.   The name is variously derived from its bleak situation, and from its black appearance. The heath is a broad expanse of open greensward, intersected by several cross-roads. Nearly in the line of the present Dover Road, which traverses the centre of the heath from the top of Blackheath Hill eastward towards Shooter's Hill, ran the ancient Watling Street or Roman Road; and along this road were numerous tumuli. Many of them, including those within Greenwich Park, near Croom's Hill Gate, of which we have spoken in the previous chapter, were opened towards the end of the last century. They were found to be mostly small conical mounds, with a circular trench at the base, and are presumed to have been Romano- British. No skeletons were discovered in them, but there were <QUOTE>some locks of hair, and <num value="1">one</num> fine braid of an auburn hue was  <Q>tenacious and very distinct,</Q>  and  <Q>contained its natural phlogiston.</Q>  The <hi rend=italics>spolia</hi> were chiefly iron spear-heads (<num value="1">one</num> <num value="15">fifteen</num> inches long and <num value="2">two</num> inches broad was found  <Q>in the native gravel</Q> ), knives, and nails, glass beads, and woollen and linen cloth. At the south-west corner of the heath, by Blackheath Hill, urns (some of which are in the British Museum) and other Roman remains have been found.</QUOTE> Near the summit of the hill, at a spot called <QUOTE>The Point,</QUOTE> a remarkable cavern, extending several <num value="100">hundred</num> feet under ground, was discovered about the year <datestruct value="1780"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, in laying the foundation of a house. <QUOTE>The entrance,</QUOTE> writes Richardson in his <QUOTE>History of Greenwich,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>was then through a narrow aperture, but a flight of steps have since been made. It consists of <num value="4">four</num> irregular apartments, in the furthest of which is a well of pure water, twentyseven feet in depth.   They are cut out of a stratum of chalk and flint, and communicate by small avenues; the bottom of the cavern is sand. From   the well at the extremity of this singular excavation, it seems probable that it has, at some distant period, been used as a place of concealment, and the general supposition is that it was used for that purpose during the Saxon and Danish contests, but nothing has been discovered to assist inquiry.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Previous to the erection of the several villa residences with which the heath is now nearly surrounded on <num value="3">three</num> sides, this place was the scene of many important historical and political events. 
   <P>Here, as we have already had   occasion   to remark, the main body of the Danish army lay encamped in the reign of Ethelred, while their ships held possession of the river for <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> years in succession.   Several places in the neighbourhood are still called <QUOTE>Coombs</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>Comps</QUOTE> East Coombe and West Coombe, <num value="2">two</num> estates on the borders of the heath, are presumed to trace their names from the encampments of the Danes at this place-<hi rend=italics>coomb</hi> as well as <hi rend=italics>comp</hi> signifying camp; 
<hi rend=italics>coomb</hi> being probably the Saxon term, and <hi rend=italics>comp</hi>
the Danish or corrupt Saxon, both of which tongues were then in use.   The manors of East and West Coombe are situated at the north-east corner of the heath; and there was formerly <num value="1">one</num> called Middle Coombe, otherwise Spittle Coombe, which in all <pb id="P.225" n="225"> probability, was attached to that of West Coombe. Vestiges of intrenchments were, some years ago, distinctly traced in different parts of the heath, some formed doubtless by the Danes, and others by the various bodies of insurgents who have encamped here at different times. Of these, the most formidable was that in <datestruct value="1381--"><year reg="1381">1381</year></datestruct>, raised by Wat Tyler, a blacksmith of Dartford, on account of the imposition of a <QUOTE>poll tax</QUOTE> of <num value="3">three</num> groats on all persons above <num value="15">fifteen</num>. When the insurgents of Essex arose, they were joined by those of Kent, and began to assemble on Blackheath; whence, having in a few days increased to <num value="100000">100,000</num> men, they marched on to London under the command of their principal leaders, Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, and afterwards separated into <num value="3">three</num> parties; <num value="1">one</num> of these proceeded to the Temple, which they burnt to the ground, with all the books and papers deposited there; another party burnt the monastery of St. John of Jerusalem, at Clerkenwell; while the <num value="3">third</num> took up its position at the Tower.   Wat Tyler, as all readers of English history know, was soon afterwards slain in Smithfield by William Walworth, Lord Mayor of London; and Jack Straw, with many others, was beheaded. 
   <P>Again, when Richard II. took for his <num value="2">second</num> wife Isabel, the <QUOTE>little</QUOTE> daughter of the King of France, the royal train, on approaching London, was met on Blackheath by the lord mayor and aldermen, habited in scarlet, who attended the king to Newington (Surrey), where he dismissed them, as he and his youthful bride were to <QUOTE>rest at Kennyngtoun.</QUOTE>

In <datestruct value="1415--"><year reg="1415">1415</year></datestruct>, Henry V. was met here by the lord mayor and aldermen, and a large number of citizens, on his return from the battle of Agincourt; and in the following year this spot was the scene of the reception of the  Emperor Sigismund, on his arrival in this country to treat for peace between the crowns of England and France.

   <P>In <datestruct value="1519--"><year reg="1519">1519</year></datestruct>, Cardinal Campegio, the Pope's Legate, was received on Blackheath with great state by the Duke of Norfolk, and a large retinue of bishops, knights, and gentlemen, <QUOTE>all richly apparelled.</QUOTE> His Eminence was conducted to a tent of cloth of gold, <QUOTE>where,</QUOTE> as Hall's <QUOTE>Chronicles</QUOTE> relate, <QUOTE>he shifted himself into a robe of a cardinal, edged with ermines, and so took his moyle [mule], riding towards London.</QUOTE> Soon afterwards, another pretty sight was witnessed here, when Bonevet, High Admiral of France, attended by a splendid cavalcade of <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> noblemen and gentlemen, was met by the Earl of Surrey, as High Admiral of England, with a still more gorgeous retinue. Hall tells us how that <QUOTE>the young gallants of France had coats guarded with <num value="1">one</num> colour, cut in <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> parts, very richly to behold; and so all the Englishmen coupled themselves with the Frenchmen lovingly together, and so rode to London.</QUOTE> 
   <P>On the public entry of the Princess Anne of Cleves, Henry VIII.'s new bride, she was met on Blackheath on the <datestruct VALUE="1540-01-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct>, by the king, accompanied by the lord mayor, aldermen, and citizens of London, with all the foreign merchants resident in the City, and escorted in grand state to the royal palace at Greenwich. The old chroniclers record how that on the eastern side of the heath <QUOTE>was pitched a rich cloth of gold, and divers other tents and pavilions, in the which were made fires and perfumes for her and such ladies as should receive her grace;</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>from the tents to the park gate   .      . .        a large and ample way was made for the show of all persons.</QUOTE> Along this way were ranged the mayor and aldermen, citizens, and foreign merchants, all in their richest liveries, esquires, gentlemen, pensioners, and serving-men, <QUOTE>well horsed and apparelled, that whosoever had well viewed them might say that they, for tall and comely personages, and clean of limb and body, were able to give the greatest prince in Christendom a mortal breakfast if he were the king's enemy.</QUOTE> About mid-day Anne came down Shooter's Hill, accompanied by the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, and a large number of other noblemen and bishops, besides her own attendants, and was met and conducted to her tent by the lord chamberlain and other officials. Magnificent as was the suite of Anne, it seems to have been outshone in splendour by that of the king, while Henry himself, if we may trust the description given in Hall's <QUOTE>Chronicles,</QUOTE> was all ablaze with gold and jewellery. Here is his portrait as sketched by the old chronicler:-- <QUOTE>The king's highness was mounted on a goodly courser, trapped in rich cloth of gold, traversed lattice-wise square, all over embroidered with gold of damask, pearled on every side of the embroidery; the buckles and pendants were all of fine gold. His person was apparelled in a coat of purple velvet, somewhat made like a frock, all over embroidered with flat gold of damask with small lace mixed between of the same gold, and other laces of the same so going traverse-wise, that the ground little appeared: about which garment was a rich guard very curiously embroidered; the sleeves and breast were cut, lined with cloth of gold, and tyed together with great buttons of diamonds, rubies, and   orient pearl; his sword and sword-girdle adorned with stones and especial emerodes; his night-cap garnished with stone, but his bonnet was so rich with jewels that few men could value them. Beside all this, he wore in baudrick-wise a collar of such balystes and pearl that few men ever saw the like . . .. And notwithstanding that this rich apparel and precious jewels were pleasant to the nobles and all other being present to behold, yet his princely countenance, his goodly personage, and royal gesture so far exceeded all other creatures being present, that in comparison of his person, all his rich apparel was little esteemed.</QUOTE> The royal pair were conducted from Blackheath to the palace at Greenwich by a procession of the chief nobles, and afterwards conveyed in the grand City barges, with the lord mayor and chief citizens, to Westminster, where they were married; a few months after, they were divorced; and on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct> of the same year, Catherine Howard, to whom the king had been some time privately married, was publicly declared Queen of England. 
   <P>On May-day, in the year <datestruct value="1645"><year reg="1645">1645</year></datestruct>, Colonel Blunt, in order to gratify the Kentish people, who were partial to old customs, drew up <num value="2">two</num> regiments of <pb id="P.227" n="227"> foot, and exercised them on the heath, representing a mock fight between the Cavaliers and the   Roundheads. 
     <P><num value="1">One</num> of the most memorable scenes witnessed on Blackheath, however, was the arrival here of   Charles II., on his Restoration, on the <datestruct VALUE="1660-05-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of   <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, whilst on his way from Rochester to   London, <QUOTE>all the ways thither,</QUOTE> says Clarendon, <QUOTE>being so full of people, as if the whole kingdom had been gathered there.</QUOTE> Macaulay, in his <QUOTE>History of England,</QUOTE> gives us the following striking description of the king's reception here: -- <QUOTE>Everywhere flags were flying, bells and music sounding, wine and ale flowing in rivers to the health of him   whose return was the return of peace, of law, and of freedom. But in the midst of the general joy, <num value="1">one</num> spot presented a dark and threatening aspect. On Blackheath the army was drawn up to welcome the sovereign. He smiled, bowed, and extended his hand graciously to the lips of the colonels and majors.   But all his courtesy was vain.   The countenances of the soldiers were sad and lowering; and, had they given way to their feelings, the festive pageant of which they reluctantly made a part would have had a mournful and bloody end.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Numerous reviews, &amp;c., of militia and other troops have, at various times, been held on Blackheath.   Under date of <datestruct VALUE="1673-06-10"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=10>10</day>, <year reg=1673>1673</year></datestruct>, Evelyn writes in his <QUOTE>Diary:</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>We went after dinner to see the formal and formidable camp on Blackheath, raised to invade HIolland, or, as others suspected, for another designe.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Blackheath Fair was a celebrated place of resort every year in the months of May and October; and, like its neighbours at Greenwich, Peckham, and Camberwell, was always well supplied with startling monsters, with some of which we have since been familiarised by our Zoological Gardens.

This was the <num value="1">first</num> day, pretended for the sale of cattle, but I think, in truth, to enrich the new tavern at the bowlinggreene, erected by Snape, his Majesty's farrier, a man full of projects.

   <P>From the early part of the present century, down to the year <datestruct value="1865"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>, a considerable part of the surface of Blackheath has been greatly disturbed and cut up, owing to the Crown having let, for a rental of <measure value="56l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="56">56</num></measure>, the right to excavate an unlimited quantity of gravel.   All these, and other such encroachments, however, were brought to an end by the Metropolitan Commons Act of <datestruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>, when Blackheath was secured to the public as a place of healthful recreation. During the summer months the heath is largely resorted to by holiday-makers, and, like Hampstead Heath, it is much infested with donkeys; but owing to the stringent bye-laws that have been passed of late years, the donkeydrivers are not the nuisance that once they were. Cricket matches take place here in the summer; the Royal Blackheath Golf Club also use the heath as their play-ground, and in winter a well-contested match at foot-ball may often be witnessed here. 
   <P>In the last century Blackheath was a notorious

 resort of highwaymen.   Under the Reform   Bill of <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>, it was made <num value="1">one</num> of the polling places for members of Parliament for the western division of Kent.   Of late the heath has been built up to, wherever land was available.   On the south side, near Tranquil Vale, stands All Saints' Church, a neat Gothic edifice, erected in the year <datestruct value="1859"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>, from the designs of Mr. B. Ferrey.   The village, oras it is beginning to call itself-town of Blackheath, is built chiefly about Tranquil Vale; it has its churches and chapels, assembly-rooms, railway station, skating rink, banks, besides several good shops. At the end of the heath, near Blackheath Hill, is another collection of shops and dwellings, with a church   and schools; here, too, is the principal inn, the <QUOTE>Green Man,</QUOTE> well known to holiday-makers.   In former times there was a house of entertainment here, called the <QUOTE>Chocolate House;</QUOTE> it is mentioned by the Duke of Richmond, Master-General of the Ordnance, in a private letter; and it would seem to have been largely patronised by the heads of Woolwich Dockyard and the college hard by, and by their friends. The name of this house was long kept in memory by <QUOTE>Chocolate Row.</QUOTE> Lord Wrottesley had an <pb id="P.229" n="229"> observatory on Blackheath for some time, previous to his accession to the title, when he removed the astronomical apparatus to his seat in Staffordshire. 
   <P>The Manor of East Combe, which lies near the Charlton Road, on the north-eastern side of the heath, was appended for several centuries to that of Greenwich, and was settled, in <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct>, on Queen Anne of Denmark for life.   It was afterwards leased out by the Crown, and has since been held by several private families; in the early part of the present century it was the seat of the Countess of Buckinghamshire.   A little to the west, and near the north-east corner of Blackheath, is West Coombe, the manor-house of which was at <num value="1">one</num> time the residence of William Lambarde, the learned antiquary, and author of the <QUOTE>Perambulation of Kent,</QUOTE> who died there in <datestruct value="1601--"><year reg="1601">1601</year></datestruct>. Early in the last century the estate was purchased by Sir Gregory Page, who soon afterwards granted a lease of the house to Captain Galfridus Walpole. This gentleman pulled down the old manor-house, and erected the present mansion at a short distance from the original site, from, it is said, the designs of the Earl of Pembroke. The lease came afterwards into the possession of Charles, Duke of Bolton, who           <num value="260">260</num>

Its success surpassed all precedent: it was acted more than <num value="60">sixty</num> nights during the <num value="1">first</num> season. The part of  <Q>Polly</Q>  was performed by Lavinia Fenton, a young actress, whose real name, in some of the publications of that day, is said to have been Beswick. Her performance of this character raised her very high in the opinion of the public; and it is uncertain whether the opera itself, or  <Q>Polly Peachum,</Q>  had the greater share of popularity. Her lovers, of course, were very numerous: she decided in favour of the Duke of Bolton, who, to the great loss of the public, took her from the stage, to which she never returned; and on the <num value="62">sixty-second</num> night of the performance, a new  <Q>Polly</Q>  was, to the great surprise of the audience, who expected to see their old favourite, introduced <pb id="P.230" n="230"> on the boards.

England. St. John's Church, in Charlton Lane, was built at the cost of the late Mr. W. Angerstein. 
   <P>In former times, apparently, Blackheath was not considered an aristocratic neighbourhood; at all events, Horace Walpole contrasts the genealogies of illustrious families with those of the denizens of <QUOTE>Paddington and Blackheath,</QUOTE> whom he classes epigrammatically together. Nevertheless, the place seems to have improved as time wore on, for from about <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, the Princess Caroline, the much-injured but foolish and frivolous Consort of George IV., was living here at Montagu House. This was after the birth of her child, the Princess Charlotte, whom   she saw once every week at the house of the Duchess of Brunswick, close by. <QUOTE>The princess's villa at Blackheath,</QUOTE> wrote Miss Aikin, <QUOTE>is an incongruous piece of patchwork; it may dazzle for a moment when lighted up at night, but it is all glitter, and glare, and trick; everything is tinsel and trumpery about it; it is altogether like a bad dream.   <num value="1">One</num> day the princess showed me a large book in which she had written characters of a great many of the leading persons in England; she read me some of them; they were drawn with spirit, but I could not form any opinion of their justice.</QUOTE> 
    <P> <QUOTE>About this time</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>), writes the Hon.  Miss Amelia   Murray in her <QUOTE>Recollections,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>there was an extravagant <hi rend=italics>furore</hi> in the cause of the Princess of Wales.   She was considered an ill-treated woman, and that was enough to rouse popular feeling. My brother was among the young men who helped to give her an ovation at the opera. A few days afterwards he went to breakfast at a place near Woolwich. There he saw the princess in a gorgeous dress, which was looped up to show her petticoat covered with stars, and with silver wings on her shoulders, sitting under a tree with a pot of porter on her knee; and as a <hi rend=italics>finale</hi>
to the gaiety, she had the doors opened of every room in the house, and selecting a partner, she galloped through them, desiring all the guests to copy her example. It may be guessed,</QUOTE> adds the writer, <QUOTE>whether the gentlemen were anxious to clap her at the opera again.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Here, too, was living the celebrated Mrs. Mary Anne Clarke when she <num value="1">first</num> made the acquaintance of the Duke of York. She is said to have been the daughter of a journeyman-printer, named Farquhar, who lived in a court between Fetter Lane and Cursitor Street, though Cyrus Redding affirms that she was the daughter of a Colonel Frederick, and granddaughter of Theodore, King of Corsica. A parliamentary inquiry in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct> brought to light the extent to which she and the duke had trafficked in the sale of commissions in the army; for though nominally acquitted of that offence, the duke had to retire from the post of Commanderin- chief. 
    <P>Flaxman, the sculptor, when tired of his town rooms near Buckingham   Gate, would take country lodgings in Blackheath; Crabb Robinson tells us in his <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> that he visited him here in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>From the north-eastern corner of Blackheath, a somewhat steep and winding road, called Maze  Hill, leads down to East Greenwich. On this hill, nearly opposite the eastern gate of Greenwich Park, which opens upon the pathway leading to <num value="1">One</num>-  Tree Hill, stands an irregular castellated brickbuilt structure, called <QUOTE>Vanbrugh Castle.</QUOTE> It stands on the Page-Turner estate, and was erected, about the year <datestruct value="1717"><year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct>, by Sir John Vanbrugh.   It is entered by an embattled gateway, profusely overgrown with ivy; the <QUOTE>castle</QUOTE> itself is a large red-brick building, resembling a fortification, with battlements and towers. The edifice, which has for some years been used as a ladies' boardingschool, was in former times called the <QUOTE>Bastille,</QUOTE> from   a fancied resemblance to its prototype at  Paris. At a short distance from this building are the Vanbrugh Fields, in which is another singularlooking house, also built by Vanbrugh, and still called after his name. It was at <num value="1">one</num> time called the <QUOTE><LEMMA id="lemma.231.1">Mince-pie House</LEMMA>,</QUOTE> doubtless having been. used as a place of public entertainment. An arched <pb id="P.231" n="231"> gateway, with a lodge on each side, now standing some distance within the principal field, appears to have formed the original entrance from the heath. Vanbrugh House is a brick building, ornamented with raised bands: it has a round tower at either end, and a central porch. 
   <P>Passing along Charlton Road, which runs eastward from Vanbrugh Park, a short walk brings us to the pretty little village of that name, which stands on the high ground between Greenwich and Woolwich, and has a charming look-out over the valley of the Thames.   Here we find ourselves upon the chalky soil of Kent; and although the place has within the last few years lost much of its rural character, through the gradual extension of buildings, it is still green and pleasant. In this neighbourhood, if we may believe the <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi>, in <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>, a large eagle was captured, and, strange to say, by a tailor. Its wings, when expanded, were <num value="3">three</num> yards <num value="8">eight</num> inches in length. It was claimed by the lord of the manor, but was afterwards demanded by the king's falconer as a royal bird, and carried off to Court.   Its subsequent fate is not recorded. 
   <P>In Philipott's <QUOTE>Survey of Kent</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1659--"><year reg="1659">1659</year></datestruct>) we find that Charlton was <QUOTE>anciently written <hi rend=italics>Ceorlton</hi>, that is, the town inhabited with honest, good, stout, and usefull men, for tillage and countrye business ;</QUOTE> the Saxon word <hi rend=italics>ceorl</hi> signifying a husbandman, or

   <P>The church, a red brick-built edifice, dedicated to St. Luke, has a lofty embattled tower, which serves as a landmark for those who sail up or lown the river.   It has a double roof, supported by pillars, forming arches down the centre of the building.

   <P>Immediately to the south of the church stands Charlton House, the seat of the lord of the manor, Sir Spencer Maryon-Wilson. The manor of Charlton was given by William the Conqueror to his half-brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, from whom it passed to Robert Bloet, Bishop of Lincoln, who, about the end of the <num value="11">eleventh</num> century, gave it to the priory of St. Saviour's, Bermondsey.   Having reverted to the Crown at the Dissolution, it was given by James I. to <num value="1">one</num> of his Northern followers, John, Earl of Mar, by whom it was sold in <datestruct value="1606--"><year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct> to Sir James Erskine, who, in turn, disposed of it in the following year to Sir Adam Newton, Dean of Durham, tutor to Henry, Prince of Wales. In <datestruct value="1659--"><year reg="1659">1659</year></datestruct> it passed to Sir William Ducie, afterwards Viscount Downe, and subsequently it was owned successively by the   Langhornes, Games, and Maryons, and also by Lady Spencer Wilson, from whom it has descended to the present owner. The mansion, which Evelyn describes as <QUOTE>a faire house built for Prince Henry,</QUOTE> is pleasantly situated in extensive park-like grounds; it was commenced by Sir Adam Newton in <datestruct value="1607--"><year reg="1607">1607</year></datestruct>, and completed in about <num value="5">five</num> years. The house is very pleasantly situated on rising ground overlooking the Thames and the opposite shores of Essex, and commands a most delightful prospect, which has been described by Evelyn as <QUOTE><num value="1">one</num> of the most noble in the world for city, river, ships, meadows, hill, woods, and all other amenities</QUOTE> --a prospect, by the way, which has been considerably abridged of late years by the growth of the surrounding trees. Its situation might indeed well recall to memory those charming lines by Mrs. Hemans, descriptive of the halls of our old nobility:-- 
             <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=couplet><L>The stately homes of England, 
                  <L>How beautiful they stand! 
               <L>Amid their tall ancestral trees, 
                 <L>All o&lsquo;er the pleasant land.</QUOTE>
The mansion is certainly <num value="1">one</num> of the finest <pb id="P.232" n="232"> specimens extant of the domestic architecture of the time of James I., having been erected when the architecture then in vogue was about to be supplemented by what was then thought to be a purer style.   When <num value="1">first</num> erected, its appearance must have formed a striking contrast to the more sombre structures of a preceding age.   Red brick-so popular in that era--is the material used in its construction; this, however, is relieved with white stone quoins and dressings, and mullioned windows. Its form   is an oblong, with slightly projecting wings at each end. The centre of the principal front also projects, but to a less extent than the wings; this compartment has a richly decorated porch, and is entirely of stone. The principal ornamentation of the exterior appears to have been bestowed on this central projection; the arched doorway has plain double columns of the Corinthian order on each side, whilst above it there is a niche containing the bust of a female figure. The <num value="1">first</num> storey has quaintly-carved columns on either side of its mullioned window, and over it a series of grotesquely sculptured brackets. To this succeeds another storey, with another row of similar brackets. Along the entire front is carried an open stone balustrade of somewhat peculiar character, and at each end of the building there is a small square turret, surmounted by a cupola, <num value="1">one</num> of which contains a clock. 
    <P>The entrance-hall is spacious and oak-panelled, with a gallery at the western end of a comparatively recent date; whilst a deep central pendant hanging from the ceiling adds considerably to the general ornamentation. At the bottom of the grand staircase is the dining-room, a very handsome apartment, the side of which overlooks the garden and forms a kind of arcade, separated from the room by a row of elegant marble columns with semicircular arches. Adjoining the dining-room, and occupying the north-east angle of the building, is a small chapel, dedicated to St. James. The apartment--for it can hardly be called by any other name--is furnished in accordance with the rest of the building; each side is occupied by a row of pews, and in the recess formed by the bay-window at the eastern end is the communion-table, enclosed by a wooden railing. In the centre of the chapel is a curious font, the circumference of which is almost equal to that of a quart basin. The ancient doors of both the chapel and the dining-room are elaborately carved in oak, and ornamented with bright steel hinges and fastenings. 
    <P>The upper floors are reached by a spacious and richly-ornamented staircase of chestnut, its arabesque balusters being surmounted by capitals of the Tuscan, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, and also the armorial bearings of the Wilson family, supported by a wolf, whilst the walls are enriched with arabesque mouldings, intermixed with fruit and flowers. The principal or <QUOTE>state</QUOTE> apartments are situated upon the <num value="2">second</num> floor. The <num value="1">first</num> of these, which is entered from the grand staircase, is the gallery (<num value="76">seventy-six</num> feet in length), extending the whole depth of the house. The walls of this room are wainscoted with oak, the ceiling is elaborately moulded with arabesque ornamentation; and in the bay-windows at either end are stained-glass armorial bearings of the Ducies (former owners of Charlton) and their alliances.   In the room adjoining the gallery, called the north sitting-room, the ceiling of which is also very rich, is a most elaborately carved chimney-piece, representing the mythological story of Medusa, beneath which are <num value="2">two</num> allegorical basso-relievos.   From   this room we enter the saloon, a lofty and well-proportioned apartment, lighted at either end by large mullioned windows; in the ceiling of <num value="1">one</num> of the recesses are the royal arms of James I., the ostrich feathersthe cognisance of the Prince of Walesoccupy- ing a similar position opposite. This room   has some highly-wrought marble chimney-pieces, and its ceiling is likewise enriched with arabesque ornamentation, intermixed with fruit and flowers, and decorated with elaborate pendants. In the room next entered, called the south sitting-room, it is traditionally related, on the authority of Dr. Plot, that the marble chimney-piece--a very handsome piece of workmanship in black marble--was so exquisitely polished, that Lord Downe, <num value="1">one</num> of the former owners of the mansion, <QUOTE>did see in it the reflection of a robbery committed on Blackheath, whereupon, sending out his servants, the thieves were taken.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Interspersed throughout the various rooms are some choice works of art, and also a very fair collection of family portraits; and <num value="1">one</num> of the outbuildings, at a short distance from the house, has been converted into a museum, in which are several interesting objects of natural history, chiefly brought together by Lady Wilson, but greatly augmented by the late Sir Thomas Maryon-Wilson during his t:avels in the north and south of Europe. 
    <P>The park, although containing but about <num value="100">one hundred</num> acres, is well timbered with trees of magnificent growth, among which are several venerable yews; whilst the gardens are laid out with considerable taste, and abound in shrubs and plants, both native and foreign. In the grounds in front of the mansion is a picturesque building of red brick, <pb id="P.233" n="233"> said to have been originally erected as a <QUOTE>drinking house,</QUOTE> but now made use of as an orangery. Until very recently, this structure had been for several years overshadowed by a solitary cypresstree, the only <num value="1">one</num> at that time remaining of a long row mentioned by Evelyn as having adorned the front of the mansion, and which Hasted refers to as seeming <QUOTE>to be of great age, and perhaps the oldest in England.</QUOTE> The ancient gateway, immediately in front of the principal entrance, has long been disused. The mansion is presumed to have been erected from the designs of Inigo Jones, who resided for some time in a house, said to be still standing, in the immediate neighbourhood; and from the fact of the principal apartments being situated on the <num value="2">second</num> floor, it is inferred, that it was built shortly after the return of that celebrated architect from Italy, where the state apartments are usually placed upon the uppermost storey. 
   <P>Henry III. granted to Charlton a market and also a fair, both of which appear to have been given up prior to the middle of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. Notwithstanding the discontinuance of the fair, the village had been for ages, until late in the last century, famous for a <QUOTE>disorderly fair</QUOTE> held there on St. Luke's day, <datestruct VALUE="-10-18"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=18>18</day></datestruct>. It was called <QUOTE>Horn Fair,</QUOTE> according to Philipott, <QUOTE>by reason of the great plentie of all sorts of winding hornes and cups and other vessels of home there brought to be sold.</QUOTE> Concerning the origin of this fair there are several wild traditions, but that most usually accepted is that it was held to keep in remembrance the little episode between King John and the miller's wife, of which we have already given the details in dealing with Cuckold's Point.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="142">142</num>.</NOTE>
Mr. S. C. Hall, however, in his <QUOTE>Baronial Halls,</QUOTE> observes that the more probable origin of the term <QUOTE>horn fair</QUOTE> is that it was symbolic of the ox of St. Luke, by which he is usually distinguished in ancient paintings. The fair was formerly held upon a green opposite the church, and facing Charlton House; but this piece of ground having some years ago been enclosed so as to form part of the gardens belonging to the mansion, the fair was subsequently held in a private field at the other end of the village, under the auspices of a few speculative publicans. During the reign of Charles II. it was a carnival of the most unrestrained kind, and those frequenting it from London used to proceed thither in boats, <QUOTE>disguised as kings, queens, millers, &amp;c., with horns on their heads; and men dressed as females, who formed in procession and marched round the church and fair.</QUOTE> Nicholas Breton, in a poem published in <datestruct value="1612--"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>, entitled <QUOTE>Pasquil's Nightcap, or Antidote for the Headache,</QUOTE> gives an amusing account of these annual gatherings, which shows that they were held in great pomp, and with an immense concourse of people, all of whom 
          <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>In comely sort their foreheads did adorne 
             <L>With goodly coronets of hardy horne; </QUOTE>
but the decadence of this ancient custom was at that time evidently anticipated, for Breton ends his poem by indignantly telling us that- 
     <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Long time this solemne custome was observ'd, 
          <L>And Kentish-men with others met to feast;

          <L>And grown repugnant to this good behest.

   <P>In   <title>Merrie England in the Olden Time</title> we read that <QUOTE>at Horn Fair, a party of humorists of both sexes (query, of either sex) corndted in all the variety of bull-feather fashion, after perambulating round Cuckold's Point, startled the little quiet village of Charlton on St. Luke's Day, shouting their emulation, and blowing voluntaries on rams' horns, in honour of their patron saint.</QUOTE> Ned Ward gives a curious picture of this odd ceremony, and the press of Stonecutter Street (the worthy successor of Aldermary churchyard) has consigned it to immortality in <num value="2">two</num> broadsides- <QUOTE>A New Summons to all the Merry (Wagtail) Jades to attend at Horn Fair,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>A New Summons to Horn Fair,</QUOTE> both without a date, inspired by the Helicon of the Fleet-

   <P>Leaving Charlton House behind us, and pursuing a south-western course, we make our way to the southern side of the Great Dover Road after it crosses Blackheath.   Here we pass, at a short distance on our left, the steep ascent of Shooter's Hill, which, as Philipott writes, was <QUOTE>so called for the thievery there practised, where travellers in early times were so much infested with depredations and bloody mischiefs, that order was taken in the <num value="6">sixth</num> year of Richard II., for the enlarging the highway, according to the statute made in the time <pb id="P.234" n="234"> of King Edward I., so that they venture still to rob here by prescription.</QUOTE> The road continued a steep and narrow thoroughfare, closed in by thick woods--a convenient harbour for highwaymendown till about the year <datestruct value="1733"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>, when, as Hasted informs us, <QUOTE>a road of easier ascent and of great width was laid out at some distance from the old <num value="1">one</num>;</QUOTE> but still the highwaymen lingered about the neighbourhood, and consequently the hill maintained its reputation long after the new road was made.   Byron has rendered the spot familiar to his readers by his description of the prospect from the summit of the hill looking towards London-

 rather abruptly--if there be any truth in the poet's words which follow-by the sudden attack of a highwayman. 
   <P>For the discouragement of these knights of the road the usual methods were adopted here; and in former times Shooter's Hill was seldom without the ornament of a gibbet.

   <P>On the western slope of the hill, close by the road leading to Eltham, stands the hospital for the Woolwich garrison, called the Herbert Hospital, after Mr. Sidney Herbert, afterwards Lord Herbert of Lea.   The building was erected in <datestruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>, from the designs of Captain Galton, R.E., during the period when Lord Herbert was Secretary of State for War. It is constructed on the pavilion system, and comprises <num value="6">six</num> parallel blocks, in which are the hospital wards, providing accommodation for between <num value="600">600</num> and <num value="700">700</num> patients. On the summit of the hill beyond we just catch a glimpse of Severndroog Castle, which was erected by Lady James, in <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct>, in commemoration of the gallantry of her husband, Sir William James, who died in the preceding year, <QUOTE>and in a peculiar manner to record the conquest of the Castle of Severn Droog, on the coast of Malabar, which fell to his superior valour and able conduct on the <datestruct VALUE="1755-04-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> day of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1755">1755</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> The castle is a triangular brick edifice, of <num value="3">three</num> floors, with turrets at the angles, and contains a few specimens of armour, weapons, &amp;c., captured at Severndroog. 
   <P>Since the close of the last century considerable progress has been made in the erection of villas in the immediate neighbourhood of Blackheath, particularly in that part lying to the south-east, known as Blackheath Park. This park forms an estate anciently called Witenemers, or Wricklesmarsh, which during the reign of William the Conqueror formed part of the possessions of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux. At the close of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century it came into the possession of Sir John Morden, the founder of Morden College, who, dying in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, bequeathed the estate to his widow. Soon after Lady Morden's death, in <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, it was sold to Sir Gregory Page, who pulled down the old house and erected a large edifice of stone, consisting of a centre and <num value="2">two</num> wings, united by a colonnade; and this mansion is described in the <QUOTE>Ambulator</QUOTE> for <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct> as <QUOTE>very magnificent, and <num value="1">one</num> of the finest seats in England belonging to a private gentleman.</QUOTE> The writer enters into almost as many details about it, and the picture-gallery which it contained, as he does in describing Lord Burlington's mansion at Chiswick; and the catalogue of the paintings alone occupies <num value="3">three</num> pages. On the death of Sir Gregory Page, the mansion and estate passed to a greatnephew, who sold the estate, and the house was soon after pulled down. 
   <P>At the south-east extremity of Blackheath, but in Charlton parish, is Morden College, so named from   its founder, Sir John Morden, a wealthy Turkey merchant, mentioned above.   He erected this structure in Great Stone Field, near his own residence, in <datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>, and placed in it, during his lifetime, <num value="12">twelve</num> decayed merchants; and by his will (dated <datestruct VALUE="1702-10-15"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=15>15</day>, <year reg=1702>1702</year></datestruct>) devised all his real and copyhold estates, after the decease of Lady Morden, to the Turkey Company, in trust, for the support of this college, and for the maintenance of poor, aged, and decayed merchants of England, <QUOTE>whose fortunes had been ruined by the perils of the sea, or other unavoidable accidents.</QUOTE> The premises occupy a spacious quadrangle, and are built of brick, with stone quoins and cornices. There is a lofty entrance gateway, and the lodgings of the inmates, dining-hall, and chapel form a quadrangle. Over the entrance are statues of the founder and his wife.

<P>Eltham is situated on the high road leading from London to the Crays, and thence to Maidstone, at a distance of about <num value="2">two</num> miles south-eastward from Greenwich. The place was anciently called Eald-ham (the old home or dwelling-place), and was formerly a market town of considerable importance; the markets, however, were discontinued 
<hi rend=italics>temp</hi>. James I., shortly after the palace ceased to <pb id="P.237" n="237"> be used as a royal residence.   The manor, in the time of Edward the Confessor, belonged to the Crown, of whom it was held by <num value="1">one</num> Alwold. William the Conqueror granted it, together with many other estates in the county of Kent, to his half-brother, Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, Earl of Kent; and at the time of the Domesday survey it was held of him by Hamo, Sheriff of Kent. On the confiscation of Odo's estates, however, some <num value="4">four</num> years later, this manor reverted to the Crown, and, becoming divided, <num value="1">one</num> part of it was retained by the sovereign, and the other part was given to the family of De Mandeville, whence the place obtained the name of Eltham Mandeville. The part held by the Crown was afterwards granted by Edward I. to John de Vesci, Lord of Eltham, who subsequently obtained the whole by exchange with Walter de Mandeville. 
   <P>The manor was afterwards granted to Anthony Bec, Bishop of Durham and Patriarch of Jerusalem, to hold in trust for his natural son, who was called William de Vesci, of Kildare. Through a betrayal of the trust reposed in him, however, the bishop, on the death of the last Lord de Vesci, appears to have obtained possession of the estates, and to have bestowed great cost on the buildings at Eltham.   He died here in the year <datestruct value="1311"><year reg="1311">1311</year></datestruct>, having bestowed the estate on Queen Eleanor, the consort of Edward I. The manor was next granted to Sir Gilbert de Aton, and afterwards to Geoffrey le Scrope, to hold by the accustomed services. It subsequently again reverted to the Crown, having, it is said, been given to Queen Isabella, consort of Edward II. It has remained in the possession of the Crown since that period, having been occasionally granted for terms of years on lease to various persons. It may be mentioned that the title of Lord Eltham has been, more than once refused to individuals who were anxious to assume it on being raised to the peerage, on the express ground that the Barony of Eltham belongs to the sovereign. The precise date of the erection of a palace here is quite a matter of uncertainty; the earliest mention of it by our old historians as a royal residence is in the continuation of the <QUOTE>Historia Major</QUOTE> of Matthew of Paris, ascribed to William Rishanger, a monk of St. Albans, who brought it from the year <datestruct value="1259"><year reg="1259">1259</year></datestruct> down to the close of the reign of <LEMMA id="lemma.237.1">Henry III.</LEMMA>   Lambarde's allusion to this work runs as follows:-- <QUOTE>King Henrie the <num value="3">Third</num> (saith Mat. Parise), toward the latter ende of his reigne (<datestruct value="1270--"><year reg="1270">1270</year></datestruct>), kept a Royall Christmas (as the manner then was) at Eltham, being accompanied with his Queene and Nobilitie: and this (belike) was the <num value="1">first</num> warming of the house (as I may call it) after that the Bishop had finished his worke. For I doe not hereby gather that hitherto the king had any propertie in it, for as much as the Princes in those daies used commonly both to soiourne for their pleasures, and to passe their set solemnities also, in Abbaies and in Bishops' houses.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1315--"><year reg="1315">1315</year></datestruct>, the queen having taken up her residence at <LEMMA id="lemma.237.2">Eltham Palace</LEMMA>, there gave birth to a son, who was called, from the place of his nativity, John of Eltham, and who was afterwards created Earl of Cornwall.   Edward II. frequently resided at Eltham, and in <datestruct value="1329--"><year reg="1329">1329</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1375--"><year reg="1375">1375</year></datestruct> Edward III. held his parliament here; and it was at the lastmen- tioned period that a petition was presented by the Commons, requesting the king to make his grandson, Richard, Prince of Wales. In <datestruct value="1347--"><year reg="1347">1347</year></datestruct> the Duke of Clarence, the king's son, in the absence of his father, kept a public Christmas here. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1364--"><year reg="1364">1364</year></datestruct>, John, King of France, Edward III.'s prisoner by conquest, came as an unwilling guest to England, and was entertained by the king and queen at Eltham.

    <P>Eltham   Palace was <num value="1">one</num> of the favourite residences of Richard II. and Anne of Bohemia.   In  Holinshed's <QUOTE>Chronicles,</QUOTE> under date of <datestruct value="1386--"><year reg="1386">1386</year></datestruct>, it is recorded that <QUOTE>King Richard II. holding his  Christmasse at Eltham, thither came to him Leo,  King of Armenia, whose countrie and realme being in danger to be conquered of the Turks, he was come into these west parts of Christendome for aid and succour at the hands of the Christian princes here.   The king honourablie received him, and after he had taken counsell touching his request, he gave him great summes of money and other rich gifts, with a stipend, as some write, of a <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds</measure> yearly, to be paid to him during his life.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Froissart, the famous poet and historian, in his 
 <title>Chronicles</title>, makes several allusions to the royal palace of Eltham; in <datestruct value="1395--"><year reg="1395">1395</year></datestruct> he came to England for the purpose of presenting to Richard II. a <pb id="P.238" n="238"> volume of his writings. The details of this visit are thus given by Froissart himself:--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>The king arrived at Eltham on a Tuesday; on the Wednesday the lords came from all parts. There were the Duke of Gloucester, the Earls of Derby, Arundel, Northumberland, Kent, Rutland, the Earl Marshal, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops of London and Winchester, in short, all who had been summoned arrived at Eltham on the Thursday by <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock in the morning. 
    <P>The Parliament was holden in the king's apartment, in the presence of the king, his uncles, and the council. The matter in deliberation was the solicitation of the chieftains in Aquitaine that they might remain attached to the crown of England.  Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, the king's brother, opposed their petition, with a view to keep his brother, the Duke of Lancaster, abroad; and to show that he was the man who governed the king, and was the greatest in the council, as soon as he had delivered his opinion, and saw that many were murmuring at it, and that the prelates and lords were discussing it in small parties, he quitted the king's chamber, followed by the Earl of  Derby, and entered the Hall at Eltham, where he ordered a table to be spread, and they both sat down to dinner, while others were debating the business. 
   <P>On the Sunday the whole council were gone to London, excepting the king and Sir Richard Sturry; these <num value="2">two</num>, in conjunction with Sir Thomas Percy, mentioned me [Froissart] again to the king, who desired to see the book I had brought for him. I presented it to him in his chamber, for I had it with me, and laid it on his bed. He opened it and looked into it with much pleasure. He ought to have been pleased, for it was handsomely written and illuminated, and bound in crimson velvet, with <num value="10">ten</num> silver-gilt studs, and roses of the same in the middle, with <num value="2">two</num> large clasps of silver-gilt, richly worked with roses in the centre. The king asked me what the book treated of; I replied,  <Q>Of Love!</Q>  He was pleased with the answer, and dipped into several places, reading aloud, for he read and spoke French perfectly well, and then gave it to <num value="1">one</num> of his knights, Sir Richard Credon, to carry it to his oratory, and made me acknowledgments for it.</QUOTE>

   <P>Parliament met here to arrange King Richard's <num value="2">second</num> marriage with Isabella of Valois; she was brought hither after her bridal, and from the gates of Eltham Palace she departed in state to her coronation. <LEMMA id="lemma.238.1">Henry IV.</LEMMA> was frequently at Eltham with his Court. Here he was espoused to Joan of Navarre, in the presence of the primate and the chief officers of state, Antonio Riezi acting as the lady's proxy, and actually having the ring placed upon his finger.   In <datestruct value="1409--"><year reg="1409">1409</year></datestruct>, according to Stow, Henry kept his Christmas here with his queen, and Lambarde tells us that in <datestruct value="1412--"><year reg="1412">1412</year></datestruct> he kept his last Christmas at Eltham.   His son and   successor, Henry V., also resided here, and in <datestruct value="1414--"><year reg="1414">1414</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>the king keeping his Christmasse at the manor of Eltham, was advertised that Sir Roger Acton, a man of great wit and possessions, John Browne, Esquire, John Beverlie, priest, and a great number of others, were assembled in armour against the king.</QUOTE> This report, it seems, had some effect on the king, for, as Lambarde states, <QUOTE>he was faine to depart suddenly, for feare of some that had conspired to murder him.</QUOTE> The meeting, which took place in St. Giles's Fields, under the instigation of Sir John Oldcastle, notwithstanding the treasonable character that was given it by most writers of the period, appears to have been nothing more than a convention of the inoffensive people styled Lollards, to hear the preaching of <num value="1">one</num> of their pastors. 
    <P>Henry VI. once kept his Christmas festivities at Eltham; and here, unconscious of his critical position, this unhappy prince forsook his studies to hunt and join in the sports of the field under the watchful eye of his keeper, the Earl of March, while his wife and son, for whom he had restored the palace, were sheltering in Harlech Castle. 
    <P>Edward IV. resided much at Eltham Palace, and on the <datestruct VALUE="1480-11-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1480">1480</year></datestruct>, his <num value="3">third</num> daughter,  Bridget, was born here. She was christened in the chapel in the palace, by the Bishop of Chichester, and subsequently assumed the garb of a nun at  Dartford. Following in the footsteps of his predecessors, Edward IV. kept his Christmas here in great state in the year <datestruct value="1482"><year reg="1482">1482</year></datestruct>-<num value="3">3</num>, on which occasion, it is stated, more than <num value="2000">two thousand</num> persons were there daily entertained. This king is recorded to have laid out large sums on the buildings here, and, as will be presently shown, is supposed to have entirely rebuilt the great hall as it now stands. 
   <P>Lambarde, in his <QUOTE>Perambulation of Kent,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1576--"><year reg="1576">1576</year></datestruct>, states that <QUOTE>it is not yet fully out of memorie that King Henry VII. set up the faire front over the mote there; since whose reigne, this house, by reason of the neerenesse to Greenewiche (which also was much amended by him, and is, through the benefite of the river, a seate of more commoditie), hath not beene so greatly esteemed: the rather also that for the pleasures of the emparked groundes here, may be in manner as well enjoyed, the Court lying at Greenwiche, as if it were at this house it selfe.</QUOTE> <pb id="P.239" n="239"> Henry VII., like his predecessors, generally resided here, and was wont to dine every day in the hall surrounded by his barons. The <QUOTE>faire front,</QUOTE> alluded to by Lambarde, was, no doubt, the north face of the moated square, approached by the Gothic bridge of <num value="3">three</num> arches. 
   <P>Although Henry VIII. preferred the palace at Greenwich, he appears sometimes to have resided at Eltham, and in <datestruct value="1515--"><year reg="1515">1515</year></datestruct> he kept his Christmas here. Holinshed thus records the entertainment on this occasion:-- <QUOTE>In the year <datestruct value="1515"><year reg="1515">1515</year></datestruct> the king kept a solemn Christmas at his manor of Eltham, and on the Twelfe Night, in the hall, was made a goodlie castle, wonderouslie set out, and in it certaine ladies and knights, and when the kinge and queene were set, in came other knights, and assailed the castle, where many a good stripe was given, and at last the assailants were beaten away, and then issued knights and ladies out of the castle, which ladies were strangelie disguised, for all their apparel was in braids of gold, fret with moving spangles of silver-gilt set on crimson satin, loose and not fastened; the men's apparell of the same suite made like julis <hi rend=italics>[sic</hi>] of Hungary, and the ladies' heads and bodies were after the fashion of Amsterdam; and when the dancing was done the banket [banquet] was served in of <num value="200">two hundred</num> dishes.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Towards the close of the year <datestruct value="1526"><year reg="1526">1526</year></datestruct> the plague raged so fiercely in London that the king and his Court removed to Eltham. Henry VIII. again kept his Christmas here in that year, and in <datestruct value="1556--"><year reg="1556">1556</year></datestruct> Queen Mary paid a visit to the palace, attended by Cardinal Pole and the Lord Montagu. In the <num value="1">first</num> year of Queen Elizabeth's reign Eltham Palace was for a few days the royal abode; but an idea having arisen that the stagnant waters of the moat rendered the palace unhealthy, it was thenceforth but little frequented by royalty. Sir Christopher Hatton was keeper of Eltham Palace in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. In <datestruct value="1606--"><year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct> James I. was visited at Greenwich by his brother-in-law, the King of Denmark, and the <num value="2">two</num> kings went together to Eltham, where they hunted with <QUOTE>greate pleasure, and killed <num value="3">three</num> buckes on horsebacke.</QUOTE> 
   <P>During the Civil Wars, Eltham Palace was occupied by the Parliamentary General, Robert, Earl of Essex, who died there in <datestruct VALUE="1646-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>After the death of Charles I. the royal residence was seized by the Parliament, and in a survey made by the commissioners in the above year it is stated that the palace was built of brick, wood, stone, and timber, and consisted of <num value="1">one</num> fail chapel, <num value="1">one</num> great hall, <num value="36">thirty-six</num> rooms and offices below stairs, <num value="2">two</num> large cellars, <num value="17">seventeen</num> lodging-rooms on the king's side, <num value="12">twelve</num> on the queen's, <num value="9">nine</num> on the princes', <num value="78">seventy-eight</num> rooms in the offices round the court-yard, which contained <num value="1">one</num> acre o ground. 
    <P>There were <num value="3">three</num> parks attached to this mansion, covering a very extensive tract of ground. The  Great Park contained <num value="596">596</num> acres; the Little, or  Middle Park, <num value="333">333</num> acres; and Home, or Lee Park,  <num value="336">336</num> acres; the whole of which were well stocked with deer. The deer, as may easily be imagined, were well hunted and destroyed by the soldiery and others during the time of the Commonwealth; besides which most of the trees were cut down. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct>, the parks having already been partly broken up and the deer destroyed, Nathaniel Rich purchased the house and a great part of the lands attached to it. Evelyn describes its condition a few years later; under date of <datestruct VALUE="1656-04-22"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=22>22</day>,   <year reg=1656>1656</year></datestruct>, he writes in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Went to see his Majesty's house at Eltham; both the palace and chapel in miserable ruins, the noble wood and park destroyed by Rich the rebel.</QUOTE> 
   <P>After the Restoration, the manor of Eltham was bestowed by Charles II. on Sir John Shaw, in recognition of his friendship to him when in exile at Brussels and Antwerp; and, with the exception of certain portions of land originally in the royal park which are still vested in the Crown, it continues in the possession of his descendants. 
   <P>Like most of the moated manor-houses of the Middle Ages, the palace of Eltham was nearly square in plan, and embraced <num value="4">four</num> courts or quadrangles enclosed by a high wall. The moat which surrounded it was of great width; the principal entry was over a stone bridge and through a gateway in the north wall. There was also another gateway and bridge on the opposite side of the enclosure. The most important part of the buildings consisted of a high range which crossed the court from east to west, and included the hall, the chapel, and the state apartments. The principal courts were spacious and befitting the abode of royalty, and lodging-rooms and offices, as notified in the above survey, were very numerous; of these, however, not a vestige now remains, save the foundations, some of which are traceable round the sides of the area enclosed by the moat. Of the chapel, not even the site can now be ascertained. In fact, the only parts now remaining are the banqueting-hall; an ivy-covered bridge of <num value="3">three</num> ribbed arches which spans the moat on the north side, and still forms the entrance to the building; part of the embattled wall, flanked with loopholed turrets; some curious drains, supposed formerly to have been used as sallyports on occasions of <pb id="P.240" n="240"> emergency; and a building at the east end of the hall, with fine corbelled attics and ancient gables, formerly the buttery, but now a private residence, called the Court House. This latter building was thoroughly restored, and a new wing added to it in <datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>, at which time the great hall, which had been for many years used as a barn, was cleared out, and the eastern end of it considerably altered, being made to serve as the entrance to the house. By far the most interesting of these remains is the magnificent banqueting-hall, with its beautiful high-pitched roof, entirely constructed of oak, in tolerable preservation, with hammer-beams, carved pendants, and braces supported on corbels of hewn stone. Its dimensions are <num value="100">100</num> feet in length, <num value="55">55</num> in height, and <num value="36">36</num> in breadth. 
   <P> <QUOTE>The hall,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Buckler, in his <title>Historical and   Descriptive Account of the Royal Palace at Eltham</title> (<datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>was the master feature of the palace.   With a suite of rooms at either extremity, it rose in the centre of the surrounding buildings, as superior in the grandeur of its architecture, as in the magnificence of its proportions and the amplitude of its dimensions.   This fair edifice has survived the shocks which, at different 
<FIGURE id="Fig.240" n="2000.14.0087"><HEAD>Eltham   Palace In <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 periods, laid   the palace low.   Desolation has reached its very walls, and the hand of wanton mischief has dared to injure where it could not destroy; but still the hall of Eltham   Palace has not, with the exception of the louvre, been entirely deprived of its smallest constituent feature. 
      <P>Its north and south sides were both open to quadrangles. Their architecture corresponded precisely, excepting that the south parapet was plain, while that on the other side, facing the principal gate of entrance, was embattled, and the cornice enriched with sculptured corbels. 
   <P>In this majestic structure the architect scrupulously avoided the frequent use of carvings, which, it is evident, would have destroyed the elegant simplicity of his design; and, besides its intrinsic excellence, this specimen of the palace will abundantly prove how well the ancients could apply the style to domestic purposes, how far removed from gloom were their habitations where defensive precautions could be dispensed with, and how skilfully they prosecuted whatever they undertook in archi. tecture. 
   <P>The proportions of Eltham   Hall, and the harmony of its design, attest the care and skill which <pb id="P.241" n="241"> were exerted in its production. Other halls may surpass it in extent, but this is perfect in every useful and elegant feature belonging to a banqueting-room. It was splendidly lighted, and perhaps required painted glass to subdue the glare admitted by <num value="2">two</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num> windows. There are no windows over the high pace or the screen, and there were none in the majority of examples, though, from unavoidable circumstances, Westminster and Guildhall receive their light in these directions.</QUOTE>

   <P>The windows of the hall are ranged in couples, in <num value="5">five</num> spaces on both sides, occupying the length of the building, from the east wall to the angle of the bays; every window is cinquefoil-headed and divided by a mullion without a transom, around 
<FIGURE id="Fig.241" n="2000.14.0088"><HEAD>Hall Of Eltham Palace In <datestruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 which in some instances the thick trails of ivy impart a highly picturesque effect, which is heightened by the broad streams of cheerful sunlight that fall through the empty panels; and every space is divided by a buttress, which terminates below the cornice, and at the foot of the windows has twice the projection of the upper half.   Altogether, however, these supports are slender, and partake of the   same   light and elegant proportions which characterise the whole building. The walls alone are adequate to the weight which presses on them, but their strength is increased by the buttresses --features which are almost inseparable from the ancient style of architecture, and were frequently used for ornament even when their strength was <pb id="P.242" n="242"> superfluous.   The buttresses at Eltham are, however, both useful and ornamental; and, as if to determine for which purpose they were most required, several of those facing the south are mangled or destroyed. 
   <P>At the eastern end of the hall were <num value="3">three</num> doorways communicating with the buttery above mentioned, and also other arched doorways leading into the court-yards. These entrances were concealed   by a wooden   screen   ornamented   with carved work, over which was the minstrels' gallery, the framework of which remains to this day. At the western or upper end, where the <hi rend=italics>dais</hi> was placed, is on either side a bay, or recess, the ceilings of which are composed of very elegant groining and minute tracery, and which were illuminated by <num value="2">two</num> windows of the lightest order of Gothic. In these recesses it was customary, on state occasions, to display the rich and costly vessels then in use.   The recesses are now in a sadly mutilated condition, but the main body of the hall was rescued from   speedy decay by order of Government in <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, when <measure value="700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="700">700</num></measure> were expended on it. When it was <num value="1">first</num> used as a barn, now more than a century ago, most of the windows were bricked up, and <num value="3">three</num> pairs on the north side remain in that condition at the present time. The holes for the timber supports of the elevated platform, or <hi rend=italics>dais,</hi>
are still visible in the western wall; and above the same spot, at a considerable elevation, was a window whence the king might look from his own private apartments on the revellers in the hall, an arrangement commonly in use in old houses of this description. 
   <P>The date of the erection of the banqueting-hall unquestionably corresponds with the time of King Edward IV. Not only is this opinion borne out by the depressed Gothic arch of the roof and the double ranges of windows, which much resemble those in the hall at Crosby Place, Bishopsgate, and in a building at Nettlested, now used as a malt-house, both known to have   been erected 
<hi rend=italics>temp</hi>. Edward IV., but there is also in the northeast doorway the device or badge of Edward IV., in very good preservation, namely, the <hi rend=italics>rose en soleil,</hi>
or blazing sun in conjunction with the rose.   This doorway, headed by a label moulding (characteristic of the architecture of the latter end of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century), was formerly for many years protected from the weather by a shed, to which is to be attributed its excellent preservation. The badge appears on <num value="1">one</num> of the spandrils, between the label and the arch. Besides this, the falcon and fetterlock, another device of Edward IV., may be observed among the carvings of the oriel windows. 
   <P>The great hall has for ages gone by the name of <QUOTE>King John's Barn,</QUOTE> probably from some confusion between King John and a son of Edward II., who was born here, and who, as already stated, was called <QUOTE>John of Eltham.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Subterranean passages have been traced for some distance in a south-easterly direction, but these are now converted into drains.   It appears to have been about the year <datestruct value="1836"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct> that the discovery of these passages was made; and from   a pamphlet published a few years ago we learn that a trap-door under the ground-floor of <num value="1">one</num> of the apartments led into a room below, <num value="10">ten</num> feet by <num value="5">five</num> in dimensions, from which a narrow passage about <num value="10">ten</num> feet in length led to a series of passages, with decoys, stairs, and shafts, some of which were vertical and others on an inclined plane : these were once used for admitting air, and for hurling down missiles and pitch-balls upon the heads of those below.   These passages were explored to a distance of nearly <num value="500">500</num> feet, <num value="200">200</num> of which lay under the moat.   In a field between Eltham and Mottingham the arch had been broken into, but still the passage could be traced further, proceeding in the same direction. In that part immediately under the moat <num value="2">two</num> iron gates were found, completely carbonised, whilst large stalactites, formed of super-carbonate of lime, which hung down from the roof of the arch, sufficiently indicated the lapse of time since these passages had been previously entered.   The passages now serve as drains in connection with the dwelling-house which now stands upon the site of the ancient buttery at the eastern end of the great hall. 
   <P>The moat, which still surrounds the entire building, has been partially drained and turfed, and that part lying on the north side, which is spanned by the ancient bridge, is exceedingly picturesque, the effect being heightened by the herons and other species of water-fowl that adorn its banks. The old tilt-yard or tilting-court in the palace <QUOTE>pleasaunce</QUOTE> was for many years converted-alas! for this prosaic age-into a market garden; its high wall and archway of ruddy brick, which alone remain to mark its site, are well worthy of notice. 
   <P>We have already spoken of the <num value="3">three</num> parks which formerly belonged to Eltham Palace, and of the havoc made in them by the Parliament during the Civil Wars.   The Middle Park, however, has remained to this day, and has gained some notoriety --at least, in the racing world--as the home of the famous stud of racehorses belonging to the late Mr. William Blenkiron. After the death of this gentleman, the <QUOTE>stud,</QUOTE> which included the celebrated horses Gladiateur and Blair Athol, was sold by <pb id="P.243" n="243"> auction in <datestruct value="1872--"><year reg="1872">1872</year></datestruct>, realising a sum   of <measure value="107100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="107100">107,100</num></measure>. The Middle Park establishment is kept in remembrance by the <QUOTE>Middle Park Plate,</QUOTE> founded in <datestruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>, and which is <num value="1">one</num> of the chief races at the Newmarket <datestruct VALUE="-10-2"><day reg="2">Second</day> <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct> Meeting. The memory of the Horn Park is still preserved in Horn Park Farm, at some little distance to the west of the palace. 
   <P>On the east side of Eltham   Palace a broad thoroughfare, called the Court Road, in which are numerous neat-built villas, leads to the Eltham Station of the South-Eastern Railway (North Kent line), which is situated at Mottingham, about a mile from the village. The latter lies at a short distance northward of the palace, and has a quiet, old-fashioned air. The church, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, is a large Gothic edifice of stone, comprising nave, aisles, transepts, and chancel. It was erected in <datestruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct>--<num value="7">7</num>, to supersede an old parish church which stood on the same spot. The latter building was a singular brick-built structure, which had been patched up at different times and in so many ways that in the end it had a somewhat unsightly appearance. On a tablet over the doorway on the north side was the date <datestruct value="1667"><year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>. The wooden tower and shingle spire of the old church have been left standing at the south-west corner of the new church. In the churchyard is the monument, surmounted by an urn, of George Home, Bishop of Norwich, author of the <QUOTE>Commentary on the Book of Psalms.</QUOTE> He was a native of Kent, and died in <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>.

    <P>In the hollow, on the north side of the church, by the side of the road leading to Woolwich, and near the footpath across the fields of Kidbrook, stands a long red-brick farmhouse, of Elizabethan architecture; it is known as Well Hall, and is said at <num value="1">one</num> time to have been the residence of Sir Thomas More's favourite daughter, Margaret Roper. <QUOTE>Among other notables who have dwelt in   Eltham,</QUOTE> writes Mr. James Thorne, in his <QUOTE>Environs of London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>was Vandyck, the painter, who lived here in the summer, tempted, it may be, by the residence in the Park Lodge of his friend, Sir Theodore de Mayerne, the king's physician, who was chief ranger of the park before it was seized by the Parliament.</QUOTE> According to a statement of Walpole, in his <QUOTE>Anecdotes of Painting in England,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>in an old house at Eltham, said to have been Vandyck's, Vertue saw several sketches of stories from   Ovid in <num value="2">two</num> colours, ascribed to that great painter; but if they were his, all trace of them has long been lost, and of the house also.

   <P>Passing on our way along the high road towards London, a short walk brings us to the rapidlyincreasing village of Lee, the principal part of which is built on the rising ground sloping up towards Blackheath.   Since the formation of the branch line of the North Kent Railway through the parish, a considerable increase has been made in the number of dwellings, which are now springing up in every direction, in consequence of the easy facility of reaching town afforded by the railway. A   small rivulet takes its rise in this parish, and, after watering the village, flows into the river Ravensbourne, in the adjoining parish of Lewisham. The church, dedicated to St. Margaret, dates its erection from the year <datestruct value="1841"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, and stands on an eminence near Blackheath, on the opposite <pb id="P.244" n="244"> side of the road to the old church, which has been demolished, with the exception of a small portion of the tower. The new church is a florid Gothic structure, consisting of nave, chancel, side aisles, with tower and spire; it is built of brick, and cemented, and ornamented with stone facings. The graveyard is crowded with monuments and tombs, among which is a plain tomb for Dr. Halley, the celebrated astronomer, who lies buried under it. Nathaniel Bliss, who succeeded Dr. Bradley in the post of Astronomer-Royal, also lies buried here. 
   <P>At Lee lived Mr. Bohun (or Boone), the friend of John Evelyn and tutor to his sons; and here he was often visited by the genial old gossip. His house was a cabinet of curiosities, mostly Indian, Japanese, and Chinese, and adorned with carving by Grinling Gibbons. Mr. Bohun must have been more fortunate than most tutors, if he was able, as recorded by Evelyn, to build here and endow a hospital for <num value="8">eight</num> poor persons, with a chapel attached. The almshouses, which are situated at the west end of the village, by the side of the high road, were rebuilt in <datestruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>. At the back of these are <num value="30">thirty</num> comfortable-looking houses, erected by the Merchant Taylors' Company, in which a number of widows of freemen belonging to that company are supported. At the south end of the parish, down to a comparatively recent date, were the remains of an ancient moated mansion, said to have been contemporary with the palace at Eltham; a fine avenue of lime-trees, some of which still remain, formed the approach to the entrance, and over the moat a strong brick arch is thrown. Dacre House is described in Hasted's <QUOTE>Kent</QUOTE> as <QUOTE>an elegant modern-built seat, late belonging to Sir Thomas Fludyer;</QUOTE> it was long the seat of the Dacre family, whose name is perpetuated by <num value="1">one</num> of the streets in the village being named after them. John Timbs, in his <title>Autobiography</title>, in describing a visit he once paid in his younger days to the then rural village of Lee, says :-- <QUOTE>Here I often saw the devout Lady Dacre crossing Lee Green in her daily pilgrimage to her dear lord's tomb in Lee churchyard. She usually rode there from Lee Place on a favourite pony, and wore a large drab beaver hat, and a woollen habit nearly trailing on the ground. At the foot of her lord's grave she was accustomed to kneel and pour forth a fervent prayer, beseeching the Creator again to join her in blissful union with her beloved husband in the realms above. At home she cherished her affection by placing his chair at the dinner-table as during his lifetime. After <num value="14">fourteen</num> years' widowhood, Lady Dacre died, in <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>, and was buried with her husband,</QUOTE> 
   <P> <QUOTE>During our stay at Lee,</QUOTE> adds Mr. Timbs, <QUOTE>the Green was my favourite resort: here the village stocks excited my curiosity, and I soon understood the wooden machine to be used for the punishment of disorderly persons by securing their legs.</QUOTE> Mr. Timbs tells how that he rememlbered the stocks in many an English village, and also in many parts of London, that in Duke Street, Lincoln's Inn, being the last to disappear. He then reminds us how that <QUOTE>the rustic beauty of Lee has been sacrificed to the railway, and its rural sounds and songs to the noisy steam-horse; though the village possesses attractions for riper years, in its beautiful pointed church, rebuilt upon much older foundations; it is famed, too, for its brasses, and tombs of marble and alabaster; and for the resting-place of Halley, the Astronomer-Royal, who wrote a treatise on comets when he was <num value="19">nineteen</num> years old.</QUOTE> 
   <P>From its proximity to Blackheath, and its easy distance from   London, Lee has of late years become a favourite place of residence for City merchants and men of business, and every available plot of ground has been covered with terraces of detached and semi-detached villas and genteel cottages for their accommodation; and such names as Belmont Park, Manor Park, Dacre Park, Grove Park, &amp;c., in which the more respectable class of houses are built, imparts a somewhat pretentious air to the locality. New churches, too, have also sprung up, consequent upon the increased growth of the place.   <num value="1">One</num> of these is Christ Church, in Lee Park, a building in the Early English style of architecture, erected in <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>; another, and still more handsome edifice of similar architecture, is the Church of the Holy Trinity; this was built in <datestruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>Continuing our course westward along the main road, we soon arrive at Lewisham, a parish and pleasant village situated on the Ravensbourne, a stream   which, as we have already   seen, flows through Deptford into the Thames. With regard to this stream, the <QUOTE>Kentish Traveller's Companion</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>) says: <QUOTE>The river Ravensbourne directs its course through this parish; at the hamlet of Southend it moves the engine by which the late Mr. How made those knife-blades now so famous throughout England.</QUOTE> The name of this place is supposed to be derived from   the Saxon <hi rend=italics>leswe,</hi>
a meadow, and <hi rend=italics>ham</hi>, a dwelling.   In the village and its vicinity are many handsome houses and detached villas, inhabited by opulent merchants and retired citizens, attracted hither by the salubrity of the air and the beauties of the surrounding country. <pb id="P.245" n="245"> 
    <P>Lying along the valley of the Ravensbourne, with the land rising gently on either side, Lewisham, down to a very recent date, was a pleasant rural district; but, like all the other outlying districts of  London, the green fields which hemmed it in are fast giving place to bricks and mortar. Granville  Park occupies the sloping ground on the north, between Lewisham and Blackheath. 
    <P>The old parish church, dedicated to St. Mary, was taken down in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, when the present edifice was erected on its site. The church is a plain oblong structure of stone, with a shallow, semicircular recess instead of a chancel at the east end, a square tower at the west end (the lower part of which is ancient), and a portico on the south side supported by <num value="4">four</num> Corinthian columns. This church, which was heated by means of a large stove and flues, having been opened for divine service on Christmas Day, <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, it is supposed that the flues becoming overheated, set fire to some portion of the woodwork of the interior, as at a very early hour on the following morning the building was discovered to be in flames, and notwithstanding every exertion, the conflagration continued till the interior of the church was almost entirely destroyed, leaving only the walls and roof standing. The inhabitants of the parish shortly after raised a handsome subscription to repair the injury thus occasioned. The church contains a few interesting monuments, particularly <num value="1">one</num> by Banks and another by Flaxman; the former, which has a poetical epitaph by Hayley, is in memory of a daughter of Mr. William Lushington; it represents an angel directing the mourning mother to the text inscribed above the tablet, <QUOTE>Blessed are they that mourn,</QUOTE> &amp;c. In the churchyard is a monument, inscribed with some verses from his own <QUOTE>Fate of Genius,</QUOTE> to the unfortunate young poet, Thomas Dermody, who was buried in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, at the age of <num value="28">twenty-eight</num>.   Dermody, whose early death reminds us, in a certain sense, of the fate of Chatterton and Keats, was a native of Ennis, in Ireland, and was born in <datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>. He displayed poetical powers at an early age. In <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct> he published a volume of poems written in his <num value="13">thirteenth</num> year. In the following year appeared <QUOTE>The Rights of Justice,</QUOTE> a political pamphlet.   In <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct> he published <QUOTE>Peace,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Battle of the Bards,</QUOTE> and other poems.   Soon afterwards he became a soldier, but disgraced himself by intemperance, and died in poverty in the adjoining parish of Sydenham. In <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct> Mr. G. Raymond published his life, &amp;c., in <num value="2">two</num> volumes, and subsequently his poetical works, under the title of <QUOTE>The Harp of Erin.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The parish of Lewisham contains several other churches, but only <num value="2">two</num> of these come under our notice here, namely, St. Stephen's and St. Mark's. The former was built and endowed in <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct> by the Rev. S. Russell Davis; it was erected from the designs of Sir Gilbert Scott, and is in the Early English style of architecture. The church of St. Mark the Evangelist, in College Park, a rapidly rising district on the east side of the Bromley Road, is a handsome Decorated edifice, built in <datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>, from the designs of Mr. W. C. Banks. 
   <P>Down to a very recent date Lewisham consisted chiefly of <num value="1">one</num> principal street, and the road for the most part was bordered with lofty elms, many of which still remain in all their freshness.   The salubrity of the air made the locality, at <num value="1">one</num> time, a favourite place of abode for London merchants and wealthy families, and it still retains a few good old houses. We learn from   Hasted and other historians that the manor of Lewisham, with its appendages of Greenwich and Coombe, was given by Elthruda, King Alfred's niece, to the Abbey of St. Peter, at Ghent, to which Lewisham then became a cell, or <QUOTE>alien</QUOTE> priory; this grant is said to have been confirmed by King Edgar, and by Edward the Confessor.   Kilburne tells us that Lewisham Priory was founded during the reign of Henry III., by Sir John Merbury; but it is more probable that he added to its endowments, and thus became its <num value="2">second</num> founder. Priory Farm, at the south end of Rushey Green, on the Bromley Road --now, in effect, a southern extension of Lewisham village-marks the site of the Benedictine priory. 
    <P>On the suppression of alien priories by Henry V., this priory was transferred, together with the manor of Lewisham, to the monastery of Sheen, or Richmond. In <datestruct value="1538--"><year reg="1538">1538</year></datestruct> it reverted to the Crown, with the other conventual property throughout the country; and <num value="10">ten</num> years later it was granted for life to Thomas, Lord Seymour. John, Earl of Warwick, eldest son of the Duke of Northumberland, next possessed the manor, but on his attainder, in the year <datestruct value="1553"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>, it again reverted to the Crown. Queen Elizabeth, however, re-granted it to the earl's brother, Sir Ambrose Dudley, who had been restored in blood, and created Baron L&lsquo;Isle and Earl of Warwick. James I. granted the manor to John Ramsay, Earl of Holderness. In <datestruct value="1664--"><year reg="1664">1664</year></datestruct> it was sold to Reginald Grahame, who in turn conveyed it to <LEMMA id="lemma.246.1">Admiral George Legge, who was shortly afterwards created Lord Dartmouth</LEMMA>. His son William was, in <datestruct value="1711--"><year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct>, created Viscount Lewisham and Earl of Dartmouth, and with his descendants the property has since continued. Lord Dartmouth resided at his seat on Blackheath, in this parish, for which place, as we <pb id="P.246" n="246"> have already seen,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p <num value="227">227</num>.</NOTE> he procured the grant of a market.

   <P><num value="2">Two</num> charity-schools in Lewisham, <num value="1">one</num> of which is a free grammar-school, were founded by the Rev. Abraham Colfe, vicar of this parish, in the latter part of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, and are under the patronage of the Leathersellers' Company. The intentions of the founder were extended by a scheme settled by the Court of Chancery in <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>. There are also almshouses for <num value="6">six</num> poor women that owe their foundation to the same benevolent individual.   Other almshouses have lately been erected in the village, under the will of Mr. John Thackeray, for <num value="6">six</num> poor females. 
   <P>Half a mile to the south-east of the village is Hither Green, which, together with Catford and Catford Bridge, on the Ravensbourne, and also Rushey Green (mentioned above), are hamlets belonging to Lewisham.

   <P>Retracing our steps through the village, and leaving on our right the station on the North Kent Railway, we make our way up Loam   Pit Hill, passing the church of St. John's, lately built, and soon find ourselves at New Cross, an outlying district belonging to the parish of Deptford.

   <P>On Counter Hill, Upper Lewisham Road, the rising ground in the rear of the tavern, stands the Royal Naval School, a good substantial-looking brick building, with white stone dressings, the <QUOTE><num value="1">first</num> stone</QUOTE> of which was laid by Prince Albert, in <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>, on the <QUOTE>Glorious <datestruct VALUE="-06-1"><day reg="1">First</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>,</QUOTE> the anniversary of Lord   Howe's victory.   To the traveller who steps from the New   Cross station to the main road, it presents an imposing appearance, with its long line of red-brick frontage, its numerous windows, its sweep of green turf before the house, its iron outer gates, and its great gates of oak, which, when open, disclose the quadrangle and the arcades under which the boys wander after school-hours when not disposed for play in the spacious grounds beyond.   The school, which was founded and provisionally opened at Camberwell in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, has an average of <num value="200">200</num> pupils, mostly the sons of naval and military officers in necessitous circumstances; and the object of the school is to qualify them, at the least possible expense, for any pursuit, giving a preference to the orphans of those who may have fallen in their country's service.

Colonel Sir F. W. Festing, who so gallantly distinguished himself in the Ashantee campaign, also passed direct from this school into the Royal Marine Artillery. These are but <num value="2">two</num> out of the many pupils who have distinguished themselves in the service of their country. 
   <P>At New Cross are important stations and works on the South-Eastern, and also on the London, Brighton, and South-coast Railways. 
   <P>The manor of Hatcham, in the immediate <pb id="P.248" n="248"> neighbourhood of the above-mentioned   station, was at <num value="1">one</num> time part and parcel of the parish of St. Paul, Deptford; but, pursuant to an Act of Parliament, it has been created a distinct parish, called Hatcham   New Town.

<P>Following the course of the old Watling Street, we now make our way back to the southern extremity of the Borough, by the broad thoroughfare of the Old Kent Road. All trace of Watling Street at this point, we need hardly remark, has long since disappeared. The branch of the ancient Watling Street, which extended from   Dover to Canterbury, and thence through Faversham   and Rochester to London, was the road followed by nearly all travellers from the days of the Romans, the days of pilgrimages and crusades, and thence again until the formation of railways diverted their steps into another track. M. Sorbierre, a French gentleman of letters, who visited London in the reign of Charles II., thus writes:-- <QUOTE>That I might not take post, or be obliged to use the stage-coach, I went from Dover to London in a wagon; I was drawn by <num value="6">six</num> horses, <num value="1">one</num> before another, and driven by a wagoner, who walked by the side of it. He was clothed in black, and appointed in all things like another St. George: he had a brave  <Q> mounteror</Q>  on his head, and was a merry fellow, fancied he made a fine figure, and seemed highly pleased with himself.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Along this road travelled Charles II. and a gay train of cavaliers, on his Restoration and return, by way of Dover to London, in <datestruct VALUE="1660-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>. Evelyn draws the following picture of the happy event:-- <QUOTE>This day his Majesty Charles II. came to  London after a sad and long exile, and calamitous suffering both of the king and Church. This was also his birthday, and with a triumph of about  <num value="20000">20,000</num> horse and foote, brandishing their swords and shouting with inexpressible joy; the wayes strew'd with flowers, the bells ringing, the streets hung with tapestrie, fountaines running with wine: the Maior, Aldermen, and all the Companies in their liveries, chaines of gold, and banners; lords and nobles clad in cloth of silver, gold, and velvet; the windows and balconies well set with ladies; trumpets, music, and myriads of people flocking even so far as from Rochester, so as they were <num value="7">seven</num> hours in passing into the Citty, even from <num value="2">two</num> in the afternoon till <num value="9">nine</num> at night.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In the days nearer to our own, when there were no railroads, even this unfashionable thoroughfare was used by the most distinguished travellers.  Stothard, the painter, for instance, tells us that, happening to be <num value="1">one</num> evening at an inn on this road, he met Pitt and Dundas (afterwards Lord  Melville), who had been obliged to rest there for the night on their way from Walmer to London.  Next morning, as they were stepping into their carriage, the waiter said to Stothard, <QUOTE>Sir, do you observe those <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Yes,</QUOTE> was the reply; <QUOTE>I see they are Mr. Pitt and Mr. Dundas.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>And how much wine do you think they drank last night, for the good of the house?</QUOTE> Stothard could not guess. <QUOTE><num value="7">Seven</num> bottles,</QUOTE> was the waiter's answer. 
    <P>We find in Jeaffreson's <QUOTE>Book about Doctors,</QUOTE> the following ludicrous story relative to this part of the metropolis:-- <QUOTE><num value="1">One</num> of the sights of the  Old Kent Road at the beginning of the eighteenth century was the cavalcade of <LEMMA id="lemma.249.1">Mrs. Mapp</LEMMA>, the celebrated bone-setter, on her way to the City.  On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, we are told, as the lady was proceeding along the Old Kent Road towards the  Borough in her carriage-and-<num value="4">four</num>, and manifesting by her manner that she had partaken too freely of  Geneva water, she found herself in a very trying position.   Her fat frame, eccentric dress, and <pb id="P.249" n="249"> dazzling equipage, were, in the eyes of the mob, sure signs of royalty, so that she was immediately taken for a court lady of German origin and unpopular repute, whose word was omnipotent at St. James's. Soon a crowd gathered round the carriage, and, with the proper amount of yelling and hooting, were about to break the windows with stones, when, acting very much as Nell Gwynne did on a similar occasion, she exclaimed, in a manner more emphatic than polite,  <Q>What! don't you know me? I'm   Mrs. Mapp, the bone-setter!</Q> </QUOTE> The tale is familiar to all readers of the <QUOTE>Eccentric Biography.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The Old Kent Road, known as Kent Street Road until the end of the last century, was a continuation of Kent Street, in the Borough, of which we have already spoken,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="70">70</num>.</NOTE> and was the highway from Kent to the metropolis. There were but few houses in the Kent Road a century ago. Rocque's Map, published in <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>, shows the thoroughfare lined with hedgerows, bespeaking its rural character in the days of George II. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct> the <LEMMA id="lemma.249.2">Licensed Victuallers' Asylum</LEMMA> was founded, on <num value="6">six</num> acres of freehold land lying just off the Old Kent Road. It consists of a group of onestoreyed houses, chapel, chaplain's residence, board and court rooms, library, &amp;c., set round <num value="2">two</num> green lawns. The Duke of Sussex was its <num value="1">first</num> patron in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, and he was succeeded by the Prince Consort, on whose death the Prince of Wales assumed the office.      The idea of establishing an institution wherein the distressed members of the licensed victuallers' trade, and their wives or widows, might be enabled to spend the latter part of their days in peace and quietness, was conceived by the late Mr. Joseph Proud Hodgson, in the year <datestruct value="1826"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>, when he called a meeting of several influential gentlemen in the trade, and ventilated his views; and, after serious consideration, it was determined that a society should be formed under the title of the Licensed Victuallers' Asylum. 
   <P>Subscriptions were solicited, and the hearty response that was accorded to the scheme by those most deeply interested in its success enabled the committee to purchase the land above mentioned, upon which it was resolved to erect an asylum, to consist of <num value="11">one hundred and one</num> separate houses, containing <num value="3">three</num> rooms each, besides the requisite conveniences. In <datestruct VALUE="1828-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, the foundation-stone was laid, with full Masonic honours, by the Duke of Sussex, in the presence of a distinguished company, many of whom in after years exhibited a sincere attachment to the institution.  At this time it was determined by the promoters of the institution to erect the central portion of the building, to consist of <num value="43">forty-three</num> houses, which were perfected, and speedily became the abode of as many deserving individuals. 
    <P>The applicants for admission being numerous, it was deemed advisable to perfect the asylum as early as circumstances would permit, and consequently, in the year <datestruct value="1831"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>, the south wing was erected, and in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct> the north wing, thus completing the original design of the institution. The friends of the society, being relieved of the anxiety of erecting additional houses, in the year <datestruct value="1835"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct> turned their attention to the advisability of granting weekly allowances of money to the inmates of the asylum, in order to provide them with the necessaries of life, and, as might be imagined, the proposal met with cordial approval, and allowances were then commenced, since which period they have been increased from time to time, until they have reached the sum of <measure value="12s." type=currency><num value="12">twelve</num> shillings</measure> per week for married couples and <measure value="8s." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num> shillings</measure> for single persons-members of the Incorporated Society of Licensed Victuallers receiving <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure> per week extra.   In addition to the allowances, a weekly supply of coal is granted to each inmate, besides being supplied with medical attendance, medicine, and wine, when recommended by the medical officer.   In <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct> a charter of incorporation was granted to the institution, and in the following year, on the death of the Duke of Sussex, Prince  Albert became patron. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct> was commenced the <QUOTE>ladies' wing,</QUOTE> comprising <num value="23">twenty-three</num> habitations, the foundationstone being laid by H.R.H. the Prince Consort: this wing was completed in the following year. Several years having elapsed since an addition was made to the asylum, this important subject was considered, and so readily approved of by those who had the management of the institution, that in the year <datestruct value="1858"><year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct> a new wing was commenced, the asylum being again honoured by its royal patron condescending to lay the foundation-stone. These buildings were designated the Albert Wing, in compliment to his Royal Highness, and consist of <num value="34">thirty-four</num> houses. 
   <P>A donation of <num value="1000">one thousand</num> guineas having been made to the institution in <datestruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>, by a Mr. William Smalley, it was resolved that the only remaining space on the asylum grounds available for building purposes should be utilised. This was accordingly carried out, and <num value="10">ten</num> additional houses built, which were named the Smalley Wing, the foundation-stone being laid by the Duke of Edinburgh.   This addition completed the asylum as a building, and it <pb id="P.250" n="250"> now consists of <num value="170">one hundred and seventy</num> separate and distinct houses. 
   <P>The beautiful little chapel is enriched with stained-glass memorial windows, and also several handsome marble tablets, in memory of donors to the institution; whilst upon the grounds in front of the building, and facing the Asylum Road, is erected a marble statue of the late Prince Consort, which was unveiled in <datestruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct> by the Prince of Wales. 
   <P>The expenses attending the institution are about <measure value="7000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="7000">7,000</num></measure> annually, which is met by the subscriptions among the members of the trade, by bequests, by the proceeds of a ball given annually at Willis's Rooms or the Freemasons' Tavern, and also by the proceeds of the anniversary festival. 
   <P>Close by the canal bridge, at a short distance westward of the Asylum Road, are the works belonging to the South Metropolitan Gas Company, whose operations extend over <num value="13">thirteen</num> square miles, from   the New Kent Road southwards as far as Croydon parish, taking in considerable portions of Newington, St. George the Martyr, a small part of Bermondsey, nearly all Camberwell, a large portion of Lambeth, and all Streatham. The company has altogether about <num value="170">170</num> miles of main-pipes; it consumes annually about <num value="84000">84,000</num> tons of coal, and supplies about <num value="800000000">800,000,000</num> feet of gas in a year. The number of retorts is about <num value="500">500</num>, and the <num value="7">seven</num> gas-holders are capable of storing nearly <num value="4000000">4,000,000</num> feet of gas; while the greatest quantity made in a day somewhat exceeds that amount.   This gas company was founded in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, for the supply of cannel gas, and incorporated in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>, with an authorised capital of <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure>.   In <datestruct value="1853--"><year reg="1853">1853</year></datestruct> the south side of the Thames was divided into districts, which arrangements were sanctioned by Parliament in the Metropolis Gas Act, <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>. The company <num value="1">first</num> supplied gas in <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>; and after <num value="4">four</num> years' trial it was convincingly proved that to supply cannel gas made from the common coal was a financial mistake, and therefore cannel gas was abandoned in <datestruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>.   In   consequence of the gradual extension of these works, the district church of Christ Church, Camberwell, which was built in <datestruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>, on the north side of the Old Kent Road, has been demolished, and a new church built on the opposite side of the road. The new edifice, a brick building of Gothic architecture, was erected in <datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>Beyond mentioning the   canal bridge, which spans the Grand Surrey Canal close by the abovementioned gas-works, and making a passing reference to Marlborough (Congregational) Chapel, and also to the new Nonconformist chapel at the corner of Albany Road-built for the congregation formerly assembling at the old Maze Pond Chapel, --there is little or nothing in this thoroughfare calling for special remark till we arrive near the junction of the Old and New Kent Roads with Great Dover Street.

    <P>Nearly opposite this old hostelry stands the  Deaf and Dumb Asylum. This admirable institution, the foundation-stone of which was laid by the Duke of Gloucester in <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, is a large but plain and unpretending edifice, separated from the roadway by a grove of trees. Miss Priscilla  Wakefield, in her <QUOTE>Perambulations,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, commences <num value="1">one</num> of her <QUOTE>letters</QUOTE> as follows : <QUOTE>We continued our excursions into the county of Kent, stopping on the Kent Road to view a handsome building now erecting for the  Asylum   for poor Deaf and Dumb Children, an unfortunate class of persons, too long overlooked, or ineffectually commiserated among us. The applicants becoming so numerous that not onehalf of them could be admitted, it was resolved to extend the plan. A new subscription was set on foot for the purpose, and the present building was raised, without encroaching on the former funds of the institution.</QUOTE> This asylum or school was the <num value="1">first</num> established in England for the Deaf and Dumb, and was originally opened in <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>, in Fort Place, Bermondsey, under the auspices of the Rev. John Townsend, of Jamaica Road  Chapel, and of the Rev. H. C. Mason, then curate of Bermondsey, both of whose names are perpetuated   by Townsend Street and Mason  Street, on either side of the Asylum. <QUOTE>The teacher,</QUOTE> as Timbs tells us in his <QUOTE>Curiosities of London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>was Joseph Watson, LL.D., who held the situation upwards of <num value="37">thirty-seven</num> years, and counted upwards of <num value="1000">1,000</num> pupils, though he commenced wish <num value="6">six</num> pupils only.   In <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct> the <num value="1">first</num> stone of a new building was laid in thle  Old Kent Road, whither the establishment was removed in the year <datestruct value="1809"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>; and the Society celebrated the event by a public thanksgiving at the church of St. Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey, <pb id="P.252" n="252"> the Rev. C. Crowther preaching the sermon. A memorial bust of the Rev. Mr. Townsend has been placed in the committee-room. The pupils, male and female, are such children only as are deaf and dumb, not being deficient in intellect. Other children are admitted on payment of <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> annually for board; and private pupils are also received. The term of each pupil's stay is <num value="5">five</num> years; they are taught to read, write, draw, and cipher, to speak by signs, and in many instances to articulate so as to be clearly understood. They are wholly clothed and maintained by the charity, are instructed in working trades, and in some cases apprentice-fees are given. The Asylum is amply supported by the wealthy; and besides its annual receipts from subscriptions, dotations, and legacies, &amp;c., it has some funded sock.   The pupils are elected half-yearly, without reference to locality, sect, or persuasion.   The importance of this Asylum is attested by the fact that in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, in <num value="20">twenty</num> families of <num value="159">159</num> children, <num value="90">ninety</num> were deaf and dumb.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In connection with the above-mentioned institution, there is a branch establishment at Margate, which   was used for the <num value="1">first</num> time in <datestruct VALUE="1876-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct>.

 From the report for <datestruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct> we learn that during that year <datestruct value="76"><year reg="76">seventy-six</year></datestruct> children were admitted and sent to the branch asylum   at Margate.   <num value="81">Eighty-one</num> children left the London asylum during the year, and <num value="35">thirty-five</num> were apprenticed to various trades. As many as <num value="4170">4,170</num> children had been admitted since the foundation of the Asylum, and <num value="1550">1,550</num> apprenticed since the year <datestruct value="1812"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>. The ordinary receipts in <datestruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct>, including a balance from the previous year of <measure value="1296l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1296">1,296</num></measure>, amounted to upwards of <measure value="9354l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="9354">9,354</num></measure>, and the general expenses to <measure value="12055l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="12055">12,055</num></measure>, the deficit having to be met by absorbing the sum of <measure value="3334l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3334">3,334</num></measure> bequeathed as legacies instead of being funded. 
   <P>Close by the Deaf and Dumb Asylum the Old Kent Road terminates in the branch thoroughfares of New Kent Road, which trends south-westwardly to the <QUOTE>Elephant and Castle,</QUOTE> and of Great Dover Street, which unites wvith the Borough, close by St. George's Church. The former of these thoroughfares-formerly called the Greenwich Road--is a broad and open roadway; it has been lately planted on either side with trees, so that in course of time it will doubtless form a splendid boulevard, of the Parisian type, and <num value="1">one</num> worthy of being <pb id="P.253" n="253"> copied in many other parts of London.   Great Dover Street is of comparatively recent growth, having been formed since the commencement of the present century to supersede the old, narrow, and disreputable Kent Street, which runs parallel with it on the north side, and to which we have referred above.

    <P>Among the residents of this street was Mr. T.  C. Noble, the   uthor of <QUOTE>Memorials of Temple Bar,</QUOTE> and of other antiquarian works. It may be recorded that in <datestruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct>, when a bill was introduced into the House of Commons to divest some of the great City companies of the estates in the north of Ireland which they had purchased from James I., Mr. Noble published a series of letters, which had an important effect in causing the abandonment of the bill.   For his successful opposition to the scheme, Mr. Noble received <num value="2">two</num> special votes of thanks from the Court of the Irish Society, likewise the thanks of the London Livery Companies, being also presented with the freedom of the City and of the Company of Ironmongers.

    <P>In Trinity Street--which diverges from   Great  Dover Street, and terminates at the junction of  Blackman Street with   Newington Causeway-is  Trinity Square, and also Trinity Church, a modern edifice of the Grecian style of architecture. This church is situated on the south side of Trinity  Square, at a short distance from Blackman Street, and nearly on the verge of the parish of St. Mary,  Newington. It is enclosed in a small square of respectable-looking houses, with a plantation in the centre, in which is erected a statue of King  Alfred. The portico and principal front of the church, with the steeple, is placed on the north side of the body of the edifice; the portico consisting of <num value="6">six</num> fluted Corinthian columns supporting a plain entablature and pediment. The body of the church is a parallelogram, and is divided into <num value="2">two</num> storeys by a plain course. The interior presents a vast unbroken area, roofed in <num value="1">one</num> span,           <num value="262">262</num> and the ceiling is panelled. The galleries, resting on Doric pillars, extend round <num value="3">three</num> sides of the church, and the altar-screen, situated below the eastern window, consists of a pediment surmounting <num value="4">four</num> slabs, inscribed with the Decalogue, &amp;c. The <num value="1">first</num> stone of the edifice was laid by the Archbishop of Canterbury in <datestruct VALUE="1823-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, and the building was consecrated in December of the following year. The ground on which the church is built was given by the corporation of the Trinity House, which   possesses   considerable property   in   the vicinity. 
    <P>On the south side, of Trinity Square, with its principal entrance in Union Road (formerly Horsemonger Lane), stands the prison and place of execution for the county of Surrey, commonly known as Horsemonger Lane Gaol.   It is a substantially-built structure, chiefly of brick, arranged upon the approved plan of John Howard, the prison philanthropist.   It is of a quadrangular form, with <num value="3">three</num> storeys above the basement, and was completed for the reception of prisoners in <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, and has accommodation for <num value="300">300</num> prisoners.  This prison not being a house of correction, the average duration of imprisonment undergone by each prisoner is very short.   Instruction is confined to the juvenile prisoners, who are assembled in classes for <num value="2">two</num> hours daily.   The number of attendances during the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="6">six</num> months of the year ending Michaelmas, <datestruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct>, was <num value="751">751</num> ; the number of prisoners confined   during   the year ending  Michaelmas, <datestruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct>, was <num value="3465">3,465</num>; and the greatest number of prisoners at any <num value="1">one</num> time was <num value="165">165</num>.

In the following February they were tried by a special commission, held in the Sessions' House adjoining the prison, and the colonel and <num value="6">six</num> of his colleagues were hung and beheaded here. It may be added that the <QUOTE>hurdle</QUOTE> on which the colonel was drawn from the cell in which he was last confined to the place of execution --in conformity with the sentence formerly passed upon criminals convicted of high treason-remained in the gaol till very recently, and was regarded as an object of curiosity.

I missed Byron and Moore by only about half an hour, on the same errand.   Horace Smith and Shelley used to be visitors there, and many others of Hunt's friends.   He was composing  <Q>Rimini,</Q>  a copy of which he gave me, and which I still possess. His apartment, on the ground floor, was cheerful for such a place, but that only means a sort of lacquered gloom after all. I thought of his health, which seemed by no means strong.   I am certain, if the place was not unwholesome, it lay close upon the verge of insalubrity.   Hunt bore his confinement cheerfully, but he must have had unpleasant moments.   He was naturally lively, and in those days I never knew a more entertaining companion. For such an <num value="1">one</num> to be alone for weary, dreary hours, must have been punishment enough even to   satisfy an Ellenborough or a Jeffries.</QUOTE> 
    <P> <QUOTE>Times and rules are changed since then,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Hepworth   Dixon, in his <QUOTE>London Prisons :</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>the  <Q>luxurious comforts--the trellised flower-garden without, the books, busts, pictures, and pianoforte within </Q> --which Moore describes on the occasion when Byron dined with him in the prison-would be looked for in vain now.</QUOTE> Here is a picture of the interior of the prison at the time Mr. Dixon's book was published, only a quarter of a century ago (<datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>):-- <QUOTE>There are for criminals,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE><num value="10">ten</num> classes, or wards, each ward having its yard and day-room. On entering <num value="1">one</num> of these, the visitor is painfully impressed with the absence of all rule and system in the management., He finds himself in a low, long room, dungeon-like, chilly, not very clean, and altogether as uncomfortable as it can conveniently be made. This room is crowded with <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> persons, of all ages and shades of ignorance and guilt-left to themselves, with no officer in sight. Here there is no attempt to enforce discipline. Neither silence nor separation is maintained in the largest prison in the metropolitan county of Surrey! In this room we see <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> persons with nothing to do --many of them know not how to read, and those who do are little encouraged so to improve their time. Some of them clearly prefer their present state of listless idleness: with hands in their pockets, they saunter about their dungeon, or loll upon the floor, listening to the highly-spiced stories of their companions, well content to be fed at the expense of the county-upon a better diet, better cooked, than they are accustomed to at homewithout any trouble or exertion on their own part. Conversing with them, we find that a few of these pariahs of civilisation hate the listless, apathetic bondage in which they are kept; that they would be glad to have work to do--to get instruction if they could. But the majority prefer the state of vegetation as more congenial to their cherished habits of inaction. Here they are gratified to their wish.</QUOTE> That this state of things no longer exists, we need scarcely inform our readers; for since the passing of the Prisons' Discipline Act, in <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>, the silent system has been adopted here, and the regulations of the prison are carried out on much the same principle as those at Holloway, which we have already described,<NOTE>See Vol. II., p. <num value="380">380</num>.</NOTE> and the prisoners, excepting in cases of emergency, are confined in separate cells, and kept entirely apart from each other. 
   <P>Down to the passing of the Act by which executions ceased to take place in public, the scaffold for the execution of criminals at this gaol was erected upon the roof of the gateway; and the roadway in front, during these <QUOTE>exhibitions,</QUOTE> became the scene of the wildest depravity. Charles Dickens, who was present at the execution of the Mannings on the <datestruct VALUE="1849-11-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>, gives us the following description of what he saw:-- <QUOTE>I was a witness,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE>of the execution at Horsemonger Lane this morning.   I went there with the intention of observing the crowd gathered to behold it, and I had excellent opportunities of doing so at intervals all through the night, and continuously from daybreak until after the spectacle was over. I believe that a sight so inconceivably awful as the wickedness and levity of the immense crowd collected at that execution could be imagined by no man, and could be presented in no heathen land under the sun. The horrors of the gibbet and of the crime which brought the wretched murderers to it faded in my mind before the atrocious bearing, looks, and language of the assembled spectators.   When I came upon the scene at midnight, the shrillness of the cries and howls that were raised from time to time, denoting that they came from a concourse of boys and girls already assembled in the best places, made my blood run cold. As the night went on, screeching, and laughing, and yelling in strong chorus of parodies on negro melodies, with substitutions of  <Q> Mrs. Manning</Q>  for  <Q> Susannah,</Q>  and the like, were added to these. When the day dawned, thieves, low prostitutes, ruffians, and vagabonds of every kind, flocked on to the ground, with every variety of offensive and foul behaviour. Fightings, faintings, whistlings, imitations of Punch, <pb id="P.255" n="255"> brutal jokes, tumultuous demonstrations of indecent delight when swooning women were dragged out of the crowd by the police with their dresses disordered, gave a new zest to the general entertainment. When the sun rose brightly--as it did-it gilded thousands upon thousands of upturned faces, so inexpressibly odious in their brutal mirth or callousness, that a man had cause to feel ashamed of the shape he wore, and to shrink from himself, as fashioned in the image of the devil.   When the <num value="2">two</num> miserable creatures who attracted all this ghastly sight about them were turned quivering into the air, there was no more emotion, no more pity, no more thought that <num value="2">two</num> immortal souls had gone to judgment, no more restraint in any of the previous obscenities, than if the name of Christ had never been heard in this world, and there were no belief among men but that they perished like the beasts. I have seen, habitually, some of the worst sources of general contamination and corruption in this country, and I think there are not many phases of London life that could surprise me. I am solemnly convinced that nothing that ingenuity could devise to be done in this city, in the same compass of time, could work such ruin as <num value="1">one</num> public execution; and I stand astounded and appalled by the wickedness it exhibits. I do not believe that any community can prosper where such a scene of horror and demoralisation as was enacted this morning outside Horsemonger Lane Gaol is presented at the very doors of good citizens, and is passed by, unknown or forgotten.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The Sessions' House, for the meetings of the magistrates of the county of Surrey, adjoins the western side of the prison, and has its front towards Newington   Causeway.   This building, together with the gaol, was completed in <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, having been built in conformity with an Act of Parliament, passed in the year <datestruct value="1791"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>, entitled <QUOTE>An Act for building a new common gaol and sessions' house, with accommodations thereto, for the county of Surrey.</QUOTE> In pursuance of this Act, <num value="3">three</num> acres and a half of land, used by a market gardener, were purchased; and   the <num value="2">two</num> buildings were erected under the direction of the late Mr. George Gwilt, the county surveyor, the total cost having amounted to nearly <measure value="40000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40000">40,000</num></measure>. The Sessions' House has been recently rebuilt; and since <datestruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct> the whole of the interior has been reconstructed upon improved principles, and the building new fronted, under the direction of the county surveyor, Mr. Howell.

<P>Newington is within the limits of the parliamentary borough of Lambeth; it is a parish of itself, and adjoins Southwark on the south. It was anciently called Neweton, or New Town. Lysons considers that in early times the church of this parish stood at Walworth, and that on its removal further westward, the buildings erected around it gradually acquired the name of <QUOTE>the New Town.</QUOTE> 
   <P>A small portion of the main road through the parish, running southward from the <QUOTE>Elephant and Castle,</QUOTE> is called Newington Butts, which, writes Northouck, is thought to have been so designated, <QUOTE>from the exercise of shooting at the butts which was practised there, as in other parts of the kingdom, to train the young men in archery.</QUOTE> Other writers, however, are of opinion that the derivation is from the family of Butts, or Buts, who owned an estate here. 
   <P>The <QUOTE><LEMMA id="lemma.255.3">Elephant and Castle</LEMMA></QUOTE> public-house, now a mere central starting-point for omnibuses, was formerly a well-known coaching house; its sign was the crest of the Cutlers' Company, into whose trade ivory enters largely. 
   <P>This celebrated tavern is situated about <num value="1">one</num> mile and a half from Westminster, Waterloo, and Blackfriars Bridges, and on a spot where several cross roads meet, leading from these bridges to important places in Kent and Surrey. Before railways drove our old stage-coaches from the road, the <QUOTE>Elephant and Castle</QUOTE> was a well-known locality to every traveller going anywhere south of London.   Its character, however, has become to a certain extent <pb id="P.256" n="256"> changed, and it is now chiefly known to the inhabitants of Camberwell, Dulwich, Herne Hill, Kennington, Stockwell, and Clapham. 
   <P>In the Middle Ages, as we are reminded by Mr. Larwood, in his <QUOTE>History of Signs,</QUOTE> the elephant was nearly always represented with a castle on his back.     Early manuscripts   represent the   noble brute with a tower strapped on his back, in which are seen <num value="5">five</num> knights in chain armour, with swords, battle-axes, cross-bows, and   emblazoned shields, thus realising the words of the Roman   satirist, Juvenal- 
    <QUOTE REND=blockquote> Partem aliquam belli et euntem in prselia turrim.</QUOTE>
The <QUOTE>castle,</QUOTE> in elaborate and costly sets of chessmen, is often set on the back of an <QUOTE>elephant.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In the early part of the present century this spot 
<FIGURE id="Fig.256" n="2000.14.0092"><HEAD>The Telegraph Tower, In <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 had an additional renown. Within a few doors of the old inn, Joanna Southcott, of whom we have spoken in our notice of St. John's Wood,<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="253">253</num>.</NOTE> set up a meeting-house for her deluded followers. Her disciple, Mr. Carpenter, covered the walls with strange pictures representing, as he said, visions he had   received; <QUOTE>thousands of delusionists,</QUOTE> observes a writer in the <hi rend=italics>Dispatch</hi>, <QUOTE>visited the chapel, and prayed that old Joanna might speedily be delivered of the expected Shiloh. But though a silver cradle was subscribed for and presented, Nature refused to work a miracle, and no Shiloh came.   After a time, Joanna and her friend Carpenter quarrelled.   The old ;woman retired with <pb id="P.257" n="257"> another disciple, Mr. Tozer, to Duke Street, Lambeth, and there built another chapel, leaving Carpenter in possession of the Newington house. What he preached there we know not; but in fulness of time Joanna died, and then numbers awoke to the delusion, and wondered how they could have believed in the divine mission of the ignorant, quarrelsome old woman.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct>, whilst some workmen were engaged in laying down pipes for the water company, a portion of the roadway in front of the <QUOTE>Elephant and Castle,</QUOTE> and within a few feet of the kerb, was opened, when <num value="1">one</num> of the men came upon what he thought at <num value="1">first</num> was a box, but what in the end proved to be a coffin containing human remains. These were found to be those of a person, it was believed, of some <num value="16">sixteen</num> years of age. All the parts were nearly complete, but, singular to state, there was an absence of either hands or feet. The skull was in a wonderful state of preservation, but on <num value="1">one</num> side there was an indentation, as though a blow had been given causing a fracture.   In the coffin was found a clasp-knife, somewhat resembling that carried by sailors. There was also a piece of woollen fabric, upon which were marks believed to be those of blood. The discovery was considered as very singular, considering the frequent alterations that had been made in the roadway for years past. It was believed that the coffin and contents must have been under ground for quite <num value="150">150</num> years. 
   <P>In Cross Street, near the <QUOTE>Elephant and Castle,</QUOTE> are the Drapers' Almshouses, founded by Mr. John Walter, in <datestruct value="1651--"><year reg="1651">1651</year></datestruct>.   The houses are of brick, and were rebuilt in <datestruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct>.   To these almshouses the parish has the privilege of nominating <num value="6">six</num> of its own parishioners; the remainder are appointed by the Drapers' Company. 
   <P>On the west side of the Kennington Road, and on the site now occupied by the horse repository, the Metropolitan Tabernacle, and the colossal block of buildings at the corner of St. George's Road, stood for many years, down till the year <datestruct value="1851"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>, a picturesque cluster     almshouses belonging to the Fishmongers' Compaiy.   There were <num value="2">two</num> separate buildings. <num value="1">One</num>, St. Peter's Hospital, was built by the company in <datestruct value="1615--"><year reg="1615">1615</year></datestruct>--<num value="18">18</num>; the other, due to the munificence of Mr. Jajes Hulbert, a liveryman, dated its erection from <datestruct value="1719--"><year reg="1719">1719</year></datestruct>. These almshouses were quaiint,--old-fashioned, quadrangular piles of building, of Gothic architecture, with mullioned windows; they were enclosed by low walls, and in part surrounded by patches of garden-ground, sunk below the roadway. They appear to have been, from the <num value="1">first</num>, in part supported by a voluntary appropriation, by the Company of Fishmongers, of a portion of the revenues of Sir Thomas Kneseworth's estate; but the earliest benefaction which can be considered as a specific endowment, and which seems to have given occasion to the erection of the hospital, was that by Sir Thomas Hunt, who, <QUOTE>by will [<datestruct VALUE="1615-04-26"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=26>26</day>, <year reg=1615>1615</year></datestruct>], gave out of his land in Kent (or Kentish) Street, Southwark, <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> a year to the poor of the Company of Fishmongers, on condition that the company should build an hospital, containing houses for <num value="6">six</num> poor freemen, and to have the houses rent free, and a yearly sum of <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">40</num>s.</measure> a-piece, to be paid quarterly; and every of them, on St. Thomas's Day, to have a gown of <num value="3">three</num> yards of good cloth, of <measure value="8s." type=currency><num value="8">8</num>s.</measure> a yard, and also <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>s.</measure> in money to make it up; that if any alms-man should die, and leave a wife, so long as she should continue a widow, she should have her dwelling free, but if she should marry, she should not tarry there; and <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">40</num>s.</measure> and a yearly gown should go to some honest brother of the company, who should wear the gown at times convenient, with the donor's arms on it, and the dolphin at its top.</QUOTE> 
   <P>William Hunt, Esq., son of the above-mentioned Sir Thomas, in accomplishment of his father's will, executed <num value="2">two</num> several grants of annuities of <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> each, dated <datestruct VALUE="1618-11-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct>, issuing from cottages and lands in Kent Street, which annuities were granted <QUOTE>To the governors of St. Peter's Hospital, founded by the wardens and commonalty of the Mystery of Fishmongers.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1616--"><year reg="1616">1616</year></datestruct> Mr. Robert Spencer gave <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> towards erecting <num value="12">twelve</num> or more almshouses for the company's poor; and in the following year, on mention of Hunt's legacy and Spencer's donation, and an estimate by the wardens that <num value="12">twelve</num> dwellings could be erected for   <measure value="400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400">400</num></measure>, the court of the company consented to the erecting thereof, <QUOTE>with all convenient speed ;</QUOTE> and they obtained, on petition, from James I., dated <datestruct VALUE="1618-10-2"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=2>2</day>, <year reg=1618>1618</year></datestruct>, permission to erect and establish the said almshouses, to be called <QUOTE>St. Peter's Hospital,</QUOTE> and the court of the company to be incorporated by the name of <QUOTE>the Governors of St. Peter's Hospital, founded by the wardens and company of the Mystery of Fishmongers of the City of London,</QUOTE> &amp;c., with a common seal, power to hold lands, &amp;c., and to make statutes for the government of the said hospital. The court ordered (<datestruct VALUE="1618-11-23"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=23>23rd</day>, <year reg=1618>1618</year></datestruct>) that <num value="13">thirteen</num> poor men and women should be placed in the hospital at the next Christmas, <num value="6">six</num> of them being pursuant to Hunt's will. Each of them were to receive so much money weekly as, with the company's alms and Hunt's legacy, should make their pensions <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> weekly. 
    <P>By degrees more houses were added to those <pb id="P.258" n="258"> originally built, and the whole building as it stood, down to the time of its demolition, consisting of <num value="22">twenty-two</num> dwellings, a chapel, and a hall, was finished in <datestruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></datestruct>, as appeared by an inscription on the east front of the hall. The windows of the hall were enriched with painted glass, and over the chimney-piece were the arms, supporters, crest, and motto of the Fishmongers' Company.   St. Peter's Hospital is now located at Wandsworth. 
   <P>Hulbert's Almshouses were erected on a piece of ground belonging to the Fishmongers' Company, lying on the south side of St. Peter's Hospital. It was a neat and imposing little pile, consisting of <num value="3">three</num> courts with gardens behind, together with a dining-hall and chapel, and a statue of the founder on a pedestal in the centre of the enclosure. 
    <P>In the high road between the <QUOTE>Elephant and  Castle</QUOTE> and Kennington Park   stands the   old  Newington Grammar School, with the date <datestruct value="1666"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct> over the door. 
    <P>There was formerly a hospital of Our Lady and St. Catherine at Newington, which continued till the year <datestruct value="1551"><year reg="1551">1551</year></datestruct>, when their proctor, William Cleybrooke, being dispossessed of his home, was fortunate enough to obtain a licence to beg!

   <P>At the beginning of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century there was in this parish a theatre, in which the Lord Admiral's and Lord Chamberlain's <QUOTE>servants</QUOTE> performed. This theatre was occasionally used by the players from   the <QUOTE>Globe</QUOTE> at Bankside, in Shakespeare's time.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="5">5</num>.</NOTE> The exact site of the abovementioned theatre is not known, but it was probably very near to the spot where now stands the <QUOTE>Elephant and Castle</QUOTE> Theatre, on the south side of the New Kent Road, near the railway station. 
     <P>At a short distance westward of the Fishmongers' Almshouses, near to West Square, on the south side of St. George's Road, formerly stood the tall boarded structure represented in our illustration on page <num value="256">256</num>. It served for some time the purposes of a semaphore telegraph tower. 
    <P>Nearly opposite the <QUOTE>Elephant and Castle,</QUOTE> and on part of the ground formerly occupied by the   Fishmongers' Almshouses, stands the Metropolitan   Tabernacle-better known as <QUOTE>Spurgeon's Chapel,</QUOTE> --the <num value="1">first</num> stone of which was laid by Sir Samuel   Morton Peto in <datestruct VALUE="1859-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>.

 <pb id="P.260" n="260"> is upwards of <num value="140">140</num> feet long, <num value="80">80</num> feet broad, and <num value="60">60</num> feet high, is approached at the eastern end by a flight of steps which extend the whole width of the building.   The principal entrances are beneath a noble portico, the entablature and pediment of which are supported by <num value="6">six</num> lofty Corinthian columns. The chapel contains some <num value="5500">5,500</num> sittings of all kinds. There is room for <num value="6000">6,000</num> persons without excessive crowding; and there are also a lecture-hall capable of holding about <num value="900">900</num>, a school-room   for <num value="1000">1,000</num> children, <num value="6">six</num> class-rooms, <QUOTE>kitchen, lavatory, and retiring-rooms below   stairs.</QUOTE> Besides these the building   contains <QUOTE>a ladies' room   for working meetings, a young men's class-room, and a secretary's room on the ground floor; <num value="3">three</num> vestries, for pastor, deacons, and elders on the <num value="1">first</num> floor; and <num value="3">three</num> store-rooms on the <num value="2">second</num> floor.</QUOTE> 
   <P>As we have already had occasion to state,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="29">29</num>.</NOTE> the congregation for whom this edifice was erected, met originally in New Park Street Chapel, Southwark. In   the month   of <datestruct VALUE="1853-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1853">1853</year></datestruct>, <LEMMA id="lemma.260.1">Mr. Charles Haddon Spurgeon</LEMMA>, being then <num value="19">nineteen</num> years of age, preached there for the <num value="1">first</num> time. It may not be out of place here to say a few words about the career of so eminent a preacher as Mr. Spurgeon. Born at Kelvedon, in Essex, in <datestruct VALUE="1834-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, he was educated at Colchester, and as youth advanced he became usher in a school at Newmarket. <QUOTE>Some of his relatives who were Independents,</QUOTE> as we gather from <QUOTE>Men of the Time,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>proposed that he should enter <num value="1">one</num>   of their colleges, and undergo a training for the ministry. But his own convictions were in favour of other views; and   accordingly   he joined   the   church formerly presided over by the late Robert Hall, at Cambridge. From this period he became almost entirely a village preacher and tract distributor. At Teversham, a village near Cambridge, Mr. Spurgeon, under the designation   of  <Q>the Boy Preacher,</Q>  delivered his <num value="1">first</num> sermon; and shortly afterwards he was invited to become pastor at a small Baptist chapel at Waterbeach. The invitation was accepted. The lad of <num value="17">seventeen</num> soon became a celebrated character; the barn at Waterbeach was filled with auditors, while listening crowds contented themselves with the sound of his voice from the outside. Invitations to preach were sent to him from   the surrounding places.   His fame reached London; and the church at New Park Street, in Southwark, whose pulpit had in former days been occupied by Dr. Rippon, now courted his favours. This call being accepted, Mr. Spurgeon made his <num value="1">first</num> appearance before a London congregation in <datestruct value="1853--"><year reg="1853">1853</year></datestruct>, with so much success, that ere <num value="2">two</num> years had passed away it was considered necessary to enlarge the building, pending which alteration he officiated for <num value="4">four</num> months at Exeter Hall; and that edifice was always so crowded, that hundreds were turned away from the doors. The enlargement of Park Street Chapel, however, proved to be insufficient. His hearers multiplied so rapidly that it became expedient to engage the Surrey Music Hall.   A lamentable accident, however, having occurred within its walls in <datestruct VALUE="1856-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>, his followers erected for him a handsome new chapel in the Kennington   Road, which   was publicly opened in <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> During the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="7">seven</num> years of Mr. Spurgeon's ministry in London, and in consequence of his untiring perseverance, upwards of <measure value="31000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="31000">31,000</num></measure> had been subscribed for the building, and the structure was accordingly opened free of debt. 
   <P>During the short time that Mr. Spurgeon occupied the platform at Exeter Hall, paragraphs appeared in the newspapers announcing that <QUOTE>the Strand was blocked up by crowds who gathered to hear a young man in Exeter Hall.</QUOTE> Remarks of no very flattering character appeared in various journals, and the multitude was thereby increased.   Caricatures adorned the printsellers' windows; among them   <num value="1">one</num> entitled <QUOTE>Catch-&lsquo;em-alive-O!</QUOTE> wherein the popular preacher was depicted with his head surmounted by <num value="1">one</num> of those peculiarly-prepared sheets of fly-paper known by that name, to which were adhering or fluttering all sorts of winged characters--from   the Lord Chancellor down to Mrs. Gamp-and in the most ridiculous attitudes; Mr. Spurgeon's name, too, continued to be made more and more known by pamphlets and letters in the papers, which all tended to swell the crowd. As we shall have more to say of Mr. Spurgeon and his preaching presently, when dealing with the music-hall in the Surrey Gardens, we will only add here that in treating of the hostility which the Puritans and Nonconformists have always shown to the stage, M. Alphonse Esquiros remarks in his <QUOTE>English at Home,</QUOTE> that <QUOTE><num value="1">one</num> of the fiercest diatribes against the dramatic art was lately (<datestruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></datestruct>) uttered by Mr. Spurgeon;</QUOTE> and he adds, <QUOTE>As Mr. Spurgeon is an eloquent preacher, but borrows several of his best effects from theatrical action, it has been asked whether a little professional jealousy has not been mixed up with his attacks.</QUOTE> It would seem, however, as if there were no limits to Mr. Spurgeon's personal popularity. 
   <P>In connection with the Metropolitan Tabernacle are some almshouses and schools close by the <QUOTE>Elephant and Castle</QUOTE> Railway Station; a college <pb id="P.261" n="261"> for training young men for the Nonconformist ministry; and an orphanage at Stockwell. 
     <P>At a short distance beyond the Metropolitan   Tabernacle, down to the close of the year <datestruct value="1875"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct>, the roadway running southward was considerably narrowed, and formed an awkward bend, by the inconvenient position of the old parish church of St.   Mary, Newington, the eastern end of which closely abutted on the roadway. The extent of St. Mary's parish is thus set forth in the <QUOTE>New View of   London</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>):-- <QUOTE>Beginning at the windmill near Mr. Bowyer's by Camberwell, and <num value="2">two</num> fields thence westward and to Kennington Common, it extends northward   from   thence to Newington   Church, and thence both sides of the road to the   Fishmongers' Almshouses exclusive: and then on the easterly side of the way to the turning to Kent   Street, with all the western side of that street to the Lock; then they pass, in walking the bounds, through Walworth Field and Common, and thence to the said windmill again: in which circuit is contained the number of <num value="620">620</num> dwelling houses.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Not only Lysons, as we have already mentioned, but also other writers on the churches of Surrey, have stated that St. Mary's Church stood at some distance further eastward, or have at all events expressed some difference of opinion upon the subject. Dr. H. C. Barlow, in an article in the 
 <hi rend=italics>Builder</hi> in <datestruct VALUE="1874-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>, endeavours to prove that the original site of the church-that, at least, of the  Domesday Record--was where the fabric stood down to the time of its recent removal.   Dr.  Barlow writes :--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>By means of an old document, found some years ago among my grandfather's papers--a copy of a <hi rend=italics>terrier</hi> of the glebe lands, houses, &amp;c., made in <datestruct value="1729--"><year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct>, and of which he took a copy in <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, when Rector's Warden--I am enabled to demonstrate that the church, since the  Norman Conquest, has never changed its situation.  In that portion of Domesday Book which relates to Surrey, there is a description of the manor of  Waleorde (Walworth), where it is said there is a church with <num value="8">eight</num> acres of meadow-land.   The <num value="1">first</num> mention of Neweton (Newington) occurs in the Testa de Nevil <hi rend=italics>(sive Liber ]Feodorum</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Curia  Saccarii</hi>), of the time of Henry III., or the <num value="1">first</num> half of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century; it is there stated that the queen's goldsmith holds of the king, <hi rend=italics>in capite</hi>, <num value="1">one</num> acre of land in Neweton, by the service of rendering a gallon of honey. In the taxation of spiritualities made by Pope Nicholas IV., in <datestruct value="1292--"><year reg="1292">1292</year></datestruct>, the church is spoken of as being at Newington; and in the Archbishop of Canterbury's  Register, <datestruct value="1313--"><year reg="1313">1313</year></datestruct>, the parish is called Newington 
<foreign lang=la>juxta</foreign> London, 
     <P>The living was a rectory, then in the archbishop's gift, and of increasing value.   In the time of King Edward the Confessor it was worth only xxx. <hi rend=italics>solidi</hi>, but when the Domesday Survey was made it was worth double that sum. The manor, on the contrary, was becoming of less importance. The <num value="1">first</num> notice we have of it is that  Edmund Ironside gave it to Hitard, his jester, who, on going to Rome, gave it to Christ Church,  Canterbury. In King Edward's time it was taxed for <num value="5">five</num> hides (<num value="500">500</num> acres), but at the time of the survey, for <num value="3">three</num> hides and a half only, nearly onethird less. After the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century we hear no more of the church at Walworde; from that time the church is said to be at Newington. The question, therefore, is, did the original church stand at Walworth, and was subsequently moved to Newington, or did it only change its name with the new name given to the parish? Lysons, who wrote, in <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>,  <Q>Environs of London,</Q>  suggests that the church might have been rebuilt on a new site, and becoming surrounded by houses, the locality received the name of Neweton, or Newtown, subsequently Newington.   But this suggestion is a mere hypothesis. Where churches have been <num value="1">first</num> built there is a general disposition on the part of ecclesiastics to retain them; the pious commonly desire to worship God where their forefathers knelt before them, and it is the duty of the clergy to encourage this sentiment.   In those days there were no London improvements required at Newington to endanger the sacred fabric and change its hallowed locality.   When   churches need rebuilding, it has been the rule in England to rebuild them where they stood before, and I shall be able to show that the church at Walworde, otherwise Newington, was no exception to this laudable practice. 
   <P>The words of Domesday record   are--<QUOTE lang=la>Ibi Ecclesia et viii. acre prati.</QUOTE> These <num value="8">eight</num> acres of meadow-land were attached to the church, and formed the church field. They were also contiguous to the manor, which was of large extent; and in King Edward's time, consisting of <num value="500">500</num> acres, occupied nearly the whole of the present parish, which contains only <num value="630">630</num> acres, including Walworth Common.   Even the <num value="350">350</num> acres, the extent of the manor at the time of the Conquest, supposing the present manor-house to stand near the site of the original <num value="1">one</num>, and to indicate the probable centre of the manor, would bring the situation of Newington Church within the full meaning   of the words <QUOTE lang=la>Ibi Ecclesia et viii. acrae prati.</QUOTE>   The old church at Newington had a low square tower of flint and rag-stone, similar to other church <pb id="P.262" n="262"> towers in Surrey that date from the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century, or somewhat earlier, and its becoming surrounded with houses was comparatively a recent event. 
    <P>Manning and Bray, in their great history of Surrey, have no hesitation in considering Waleorde (Walworth), still the name of the manor, to be the same as Newington; and the Rev. Mr. Hussey, in his account of the churches in Surrey, remarks, if this be so, then the Domesday church was at Newington, not at Walworth.   The Domesday church was where the <num value="8">eight</num> acres of meadow-land were, and these were at Newington. 
    <P>Among      the items contained in the <hi rend=italics>terrier</hi> of the glebe   lands, &amp;c., made in <datestruct value="1729--"><year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct>, when the Rev. Wm. Taswell was rector, is <num value="1">one</num> which begins as follows :-- <QUOTE><hi rend=italics>Item</hi>. On the south side of the churchyard   there lies a parcel of pasture   and meadow ground, called the church-field, in the occupation of the Widow     Harwood, containing      about <num value="7">seven</num>   and   a  half acres. This churchfield formerly contained <num value="8">eight</num> acres, but in the year <datestruct value="1648"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct>, part of it, containing in length about <num value="200">two hundred</num> yards, and in   breadth   about <num value="4">four</num> yards, was taken out of it to make a footway leading from Newington to the east end of Kinnington Lane; and in the year <datestruct value="1718"><year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct>, the trustees for mending and repairing the road from Newington to Vauxhall took about <num value="14">fourteen</num> feet in breadth, and about <num value="48">forty-eight</num> feet in length, from the church-field aforesaid, to widen the road turning from   Newington to Kinnington, which road was before so narrow, that <num value="2">two</num> waggons could not meet there .</QUOTE>  
   <P>The <hi rend=italics>terrier</hi> also states that <num value="2">two</num> small pieces of the church-field were taken, <num value="1">one</num> about <datestruct value="1637--"><year reg="1637">1637</year></datestruct>, and the other in <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, to enlarge the churchyard. There can be no manner of doubt, therefore, but 
<FIGURE id="Fig.262" n="2000.14.0095"><HEAD>Fountain In The Surrey Gardens.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 that the church, with its <num value="8">eight</num> acres of meadowland, recorded in  <QUOTE>Domesday Book,</QUOTE>  was <num value="1">one</num> and the same with the church   at Newington, and that we may say of the latter, as the record says of the former, <QUOTE lang=la>Ibi Ecclesia et viii. acrae prati</QUOTE>>, though it would now be impossible to find any portion of the latter which has not been brought into subjection under the despotic law of the spread of bricks and mortar.</QUOTE>

   <P>The old parish church of Newington appears to have been, in earlier days, a very small and insignificant structure; Sir Hugh Brawne added a north aisle about the year <datestruct value="1600"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>.   In the early part of the last century several <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num>      pounds</measure> were expended in repairing and <QUOTE>ornamenting</QUOTE> the fabric; but this was all to very little purpose, for in a few years it was found necessary that the whole building, except the tower, should   be taken down. The new church, on the same inconvenient spot, by the side of a great road, was opened in   <datestruct VALUE="1721-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>. Being found inadequate to the increased number of inhabitants, an Act of Parliament was obtained in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct> for rebuilding the church upon a larger scale. The work of reconstruction was commenced in the following year, and completed in about <num value="2">two</num> years. The <LEMMA id="lemma.262.1">unsightly structure</LEMMA> was constructed of brick, with a portico in the west front, and on the roof was a small bell-turret. 
     <P>In this church, according to Manning and Bray's <QUOTE>History of Surrey,</QUOTE> was buried a certain facetious individual, Mr. Serjeant Davy, who died in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, and of whom a good story is told. He was originally a chemist at Exeter; and a sheriff's officer coming to serve on him a process from the Court of Common Pleas, he civilly asked him if he would not take something to drink. While the man was leisurely quenching his thirst Davy contrived to heat the poker, and then told the bailiff that if he did not eat the writ, which was of sheepskin, he should be made to swallow the poker. The officer very naturally preferred the parchment; but the Court of Common Pleas, not being then accustomed to Davy's jokes, sent him an order to <pb id="P.263" n="263"> appear at Westminster Hall, and committed him to the Fleet Prison for contempt.   From   this strange circumstance he acquired his <num value="1">first</num> taste for the law. On his discharge from prison he applied himself to the study of it in earnest, was called to the bar, obtained the coif, and enjoyed a good practice for many years. 
    <P>Here, too, was buried   Thomas   Middleton, author of the <hi rend=italics>Mask of Cupid; A Mad World, my Masters</hi>; the <hi rend=italics>Spanish   Gipsy; Anything for a Quiet Life</hi>, and very many other comedies, besides sundry less well-known tragedies.   He died in <datestruct VALUE="1627-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1627">1627</year></datestruct>; and his widow, who followed him to the grave next year, was buried at the expense of the Corporation of London, who had employed her husband to write the <hi rend=italics>Mask of Cupid</hi>, performed with other <QUOTE>solemnities</QUOTE> at Merchant Taylors' Hall, to commemorate the marriage of the infamous Earl and Countess of Somerset. 
    <P>On the floor of the old church was, among others, the grave-stone of George Powell, who is said, by the editor of <QUOTE>Aubrey's Perambulations of  Surrey,</QUOTE> to have been styled <QUOTE>King of the Gipsies,</QUOTE> and to have died in the year <datestruct value="1704"><year reg="1704">1704</year></datestruct>, in very flourishing circumstances--in fact, as rich, or rather as poor, as a king. 
    <P>The churchyard, which was enlarged by Act of  Parliament in the reign of George II., contains among   its numerous monuments   <num value="1">one</num>   to   the memory of William Allen, a young man who was killed by the firing of the soldiers in the riots which took place in St. George's Fields, in <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct>, on the occasion of the confinement of John Wilkes in the King's Bench Prison; around the monument are several inscriptions expressing strong political feelings. 
    <P> <QUOTE>The most eminent ecclesiastic who ever held this rectory,</QUOTE> writes Thomas Allen, in his <QUOTE>History of Surrey,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>was Dr. Samuel Horsley, who was presented to it in <datestruct value="1759--"><year reg="1759">1759</year></datestruct>. This eminent character was born in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, in <datestruct VALUE="1733-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>. He was educated at Westminster School, and   Trinity   Hall, Cambridge, where he took the degree of LL.B.   In <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct> he was chosen a Fellow of the Royal Society, and he soon after published some elaborate treatises. In <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct> he took the degree of LL.D., and in <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct> he was elected secretary to the Royal Society, and not long after the Earl of Aylesford presented him tc the rectory of Aldbury, in this county. About  <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct> Dr. Horsley withdrew from the Royal Society, and about the same period commenced a literary conference with the great champion of Unitarianism,  Dr. Priestley. The talent and energy with whicl lie exerted himself called forth the approbation o:  Lord Chancellor Thurlow, who characteristically remarked that  <Q>those who defended the Church ought to be supported by the Church,</Q>  and accordingly presented him   to a prebendal stall in  Gloucester Cathedral, and shortly after he was made Bishop of St. David's. In his episcopal character he supported the reputation for learning and ability which he had previously acquired. In  Parliament he was the strenuous advocate for the existing state of things in religion and politics; and the merit of his conduct will accordingly be differently appreciated with reference to the various opinions of different persons. His zeal did not go unrewarded, for he was presented to the see of  Rochester in <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, and made Dean of Westminster; and in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct> he was translated to St. Asaph. He died at Brighton, <datestruct VALUE="1806-10-4"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=4>4</day>, <year reg=1806>1806</year></datestruct>, and was interred in St. Mary's Church, Newington.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In this church was baptised, about the year <datestruct value="1810"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>,  George Alexander Gratton, a spotted negro boy, who was shown about London and the provinces as a curiosity by Richardson.   He died when only <num value="5">five</num> years old, in <datestruct VALUE="1813-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, and was buried at Great Marlow, where there is a monument to his memory. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>, it was proposed by the Board of Works, under the Metropolitan Improvements Act, to have the church removed, with the view of widening the roadway at that point, and an offer of <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure> was made by the Board for that special purpose.   In <datestruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct> a grant of <measure value="4000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4000">4,000</num></measure> was obtained from the  London Churches Fund, and a subscription, headed by the rector with <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure>, was opened among the parishioners for the remainder of the money required, about <measure value="9000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="9000">9,000</num></measure>. A site for a new church was obtained from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, in a more central part of the parish, on the east side of the Kennington Park Road. This church, a large and lofty Gothic edifice of stone, having been completed, with the exception of the tower, the demolition of the old church was forthwith commenced.   In <datestruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct> the materials of the old edifice were disposed of by public auction, and realised a sum   of <measure value="538l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="538">538</num></measure>. The remains of some <num value="500">five hundred</num> persons were carefully removed from the churchyard, and re-interred in a vault built for the purpose.   In <num value="1">one</num> instance <num value="2">two</num> bodies were taken from under the altar, and the inscriptions on the coffins showed that they were the remains of Dr. Horsley and his wife, the latter of whom died in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>. The remains were in a state of preservation, having been buried some <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet below the surface. They were removed to Thorley, in Herts, by the family of the deceased bishop.  Among the other remains which were disinterred <pb id="P.264" n="264"> there was the skeleton of a man who had been buried in a complete suit of black, the coat and boots being perfect. 
   <P>Besides the old church several houses in the High Street close by were demolished at the same time, and the graveyard, thus curtailed by the widening of the road, was set in order and opened to the public as a garden. The whole is enclosed by some neat iron railings and gates; and a handsome Gothic clock-tower has been erected on the site of the church.   This tower is <num value="14">fourteen</num> feet square at the base, and carried up in <num value="5">five</num> stages with buttresses to a height of about a <num value="100">hundred</num> feet. The clock-face is placed at the height of <num value="70">seventy</num> feet. In the lower part of the building the material is Portland stone, the remainder being of Bath stone, and the front to Newington Butts, as well as the <num value="2">two</num> sides, is enriched with carvings in florid Gothic. There is a doorway in the centre of the front, with windows in the upper part. On the left side of the doorway is the following inscription: -- <QUOTE>This tower was built at the expense'of Robert Faulconer, Esq., Anno Domini <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>, on the site of the old parish church of St. Mary's, Newington.</QUOTE> This handsome gift, which has the great advantage

    <P>The old parsonage-house, which stood in the rear of the church and of Mr. Spurgeon's <QUOTE>Tabernacle,</QUOTE> and which was reputed to date from the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, was built of wood, and surrounded at <num value="1">one</num> time by a moat, over which were several bridges.

They ran in various directions, completely surrounding the rectory grounds.   To reach the <QUOTE>Queen's Head</QUOTE> tea-gardens, which occupied the site of the present National Schoolroom, it was necessary to cross some of these ditches by a small wooden bridge. The tea-gardens were in a line with Temple Street, at the western end of the Metropolitan Tabernacle. Indeed, so well watered was the neighbourhood of Newington Butts, that, if we may believe tradition, in <datestruct value="1571--"><year reg="1571">1571</year></datestruct> occurred a great flood, so that the people were obliged to be conveyed in boats from   the church <QUOTE>to the pinfolds, near St. George's, in Southwark.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Among the residents of Newington in the middle of the last century, was James Short, an eminent <pb id="P.265" n="265"> optician, and a native of Edinburgh. He enjoyed a high reputation in his day for the excellence of his reflecting telescopes, of the Gregorian kind, by the sale of which he amassed a large fortune. He died at Newington in <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>On the east side of Kennington Park Road, near the junction of that thoroughfare with Kennington Lane and Newington Butts, is Penton Place, through which is <num value="1">one</num> of the approaches to the Surrey Gardens, formerly known as the Surrey Zoological Gardens.

 and soon after obtained possession of the grounds formerly attached to the  <Q>Manor House</Q>  at Walworth.   The grounds comprised in all about <num value="15">fifteen</num> acres, which were utilised to their fullest extent, exclusive of a sheet of water covering nearly <num value="3">three</num> acres more.

Then followed, in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>, a representation of  <Q>Iceland and Mount Hecla;</Q>  in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, the  <Q>City of Rome,</Q>  <pb id="P.266" n="266"> which occupied <num value="5">five</num> acres, and was painted on surface upwards of <num value="250000">250,000</num> feet square; in <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>: the  <Q>Temple of Ellora;</Q>  in <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>,  <Q>London during the Great Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>;</Q>  in <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>, the  <Q>City of Edinburgh.</Q>  In <datestruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct> <Q>Vesuvius</Q> was reproduced in <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct> there was a revival of  <Q>Rome;</Q>  in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct> there was the  <Q>Storming of Badajoz,</Q>  with  <Q>new effects of real ordnance.</Q>  In this same year M. Jullien organised a series of promenade concerts on <num value="4">four</num> evenings in each week, the admission remaining fixed, as before, at a shilling. The fireworks were always a great attraction of the gardens. In <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct> was exhibited  <Q>Napoleon's Passage over the Alps;</Q>  in this picture were represented some <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men in motion, who, in the front, appeared of life-size, and who, in fact, were living men, but who were made, by an optical illusion, to dwindle gradually at different distances to the veriest specks which the eye could track along the zigzag line of ascent towards the summit of the Alpine Pass, where stood the monastery of St. Bernard, ready to receive the weary and half-frozen troops and their imperial master. On the death of Mr. Cross the proprietorship and management of the gardens devolved on his secretary and assistant, a man named Tyler, who conducted them   for some years, when the property became vested in a Limited Liability Company. In <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct> the gardens were put up to auction, and the Surrey Music Hall was erected upon a portion of the grounds. The gardens were used in <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct> for the purpose of entertaining the Guards with a public dinner after their return from the Crimea; and again, in <datestruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></datestruct>, they were re-opened with a picture of the  <Q>City and Bay of Naples,</Q>  showing Vesuvius in the distance. But the fitful taste of the public did not care for the revival; and though a variety of fresh amusements in succession was announced and provided, yet it was found that the place had lost its popularity to a degree which was irretrievable, and accordingly the gardens were closed. The grounds were afterwards more advantageously occupied, as the temporary Hospital of St. Thomas, before its removal to Lambeth Walk.</QUOTE>

   <P>The principal walks and avenues were planted with every description of native and exotic forest trees that would endure the climate; whilst the beautiful sheet of water, mentioned above, was spotted with islands, shrubberies, and plantations of great richness. Numerous rustic-looking buildings, with thatched roofs, were to be seen in different parts, each of them adding to the picturesqueness of the grounds. Mr. Loudon, the editor of the 
<hi rend=italics>Gardeners' Magazine</hi>, thus speaks of the buildings in these gardens at the time of their opening:-- 
     <P> <QUOTE>The London Zoological Society has certainly the merit of taking the lead in this description of garden; but Mr. Cross has not only proceeded more rapidly than they have done, but has erected more suitable and more imposing structures than are yet to be found in the gardens in the Regent's Park.   What is there, for example, in the latter garden which can be at all compared with the circular glass building <num value="300">300</num> feet in diameter, combining a series of examples of tropical quadrupeds and birds, and of exotic plants?   In the plan of this building the animals (lions, tigers, leopards, &amp;c.) are kept in separate cages or compartments towards the centre; exterior to them is a colonnade, supporting the glazed roof, and also for cages of birds; within this colonnade will be placed hot-water pipes for heating the whole, and beyond it is an open paved area for spectators; next, there is a channel for a stream of water, intended for gold, silver, and other exotic fishes; and, beyond, a border, under the front wall, for climbing plants, to be trained on wires under the roof.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The grounds were laid out under the superintendence of Mr. Henry Phillips, the author of <QUOTE>Sylva Florifera,</QUOTE> and it is almost impossible to give the reader an idea of their beauty and variety.  Besides the large glass building mentioned above, there were several movable aviaries and cages for the feathered tribes; whilst <num value="1">one</num> of the prettiest spots was the <QUOTE>beaver-dam,</QUOTE> a small pond partly enclosed by rockwork.   Altogether, at <num value="1">one</num> time these gardens offered a great rival attraction to those at the Regent's Park, which we have already described.<NOTE>See Vol. V, p. <num value="282">282</num>.</NOTE>   In <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>   a live female gorilla was added to this menagerie, and   proved   a great favourite of the visitors. The collection here was not so extensive as that in the Regent's Park, but some of the animals were much finer, particularly <num value="1">one</num> of the lions. 
    <P>A story--we fear rather apocryphal--is told of <num value="1">one</num> of the lions here in the early part of their existence.   A   small black spaniel being thrown into his cage, instead of killing and eating it, the king of beasts took it under his protection, fondled it, and played with it; and when it died, the lion was so deeply grieved that he survived the loss of his companion only a few days! 
    <P>The volcanic exhibitions at the <LEMMA id="lemma.267.1">Surrey Zoological  Gardens</LEMMA> probably had their origin in the Ranelagh spectacles of the last century; for in <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct> was shown in the latter gardens a beautiful representation of Mount Etna, with the flowing of the lava <pb id="P.267" n="267"> down its sides. The height of the boarded work which represented the mountain was about <num value="80">eighty</num> feet, and the whole exhibited a curious specimen of machinery and pyrotechnics.   Of the Surrey Gardens, as they existed in the year of grace <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>, Mr. H. Mayhew wrote, <QUOTE>Mount Etna, the fashionable volcano of the season, just now is vomiting here its sky-rockets and Roman candles.</QUOTE> 
   <P>During the last few years of their existence, these gardens added the attractions of music. A large covered orchestra, capable of accommodating a large number of performers, was fitted up on the margin of the lake, for the purpose of giving openair concerts on a gigantic scale; and this was retained during the summer months by Jullien's band. Jullien led the orchestra at the concerts here in <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>, the year of the Great Exhibition. 
   <P>The Surrey Music Hall, mentioned above-a large oblong building--is admirably adapted for the purposes for which it was built. At each corner are octagonal towers containing staircases, originally crowned by ornamental turrets.   An arcade surrounds the ground-floor, whilst to the <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="2">second</num> floors are external galleries covered by verandas. The great hall, which holds <num value="12000">12,000</num> persons, exclusive of the orchestra, cost upwards of <measure value="18000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="18000">18,000</num></measure>.   It is <num value="20">twenty</num> feet longer and <num value="30">thirty</num> feet wider than the Great Room at Exeter Hall. 
   <P>On Sundays it was used temporarily for the religious services held by Mr. C. H. Spurgeon, on 
<FIGURE id="Fig.267" n="2000.14.0098"><HEAD>View In The Surrey Gardens.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 his <num value="1">first</num> sudden rush into popularity in London; and on the <num value="1">first</num> occasion of holding these services, --the evening of <datestruct VALUE="1856-10-19"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=19>19</day>, <year reg=1856>1856</year></datestruct>-it was the scene of a serious and fatal accident, <num value="7">seven</num> persons being killed by a false alarm of fire raised by some reckless and wanton jesters.   We have already spoken of Mr. Spurgeon in our account of the Metropolitan Tabernacle, but we may further remark here that, notwithstanding the abovemen- tioned occurrence, large numbers continued for the space of <num value="3">three</num> years to hear Mr. Spurgeon on Sunday mornings.   A letter, signed <QUOTE lang=la>Habitans in Sicco</QUOTE>, and dated from <QUOTE>Broad Phylactery, Westminster,</QUOTE> appeared at this period in the <hi rend=italics>Times;</hi>
part of it ran as follows:-- <QUOTE> <Q>I want to hear Spurgeon; let us go.</Q>  Now, I am supposed to be a High Churchman, so I answered,  <Q>What! go and hear a Calvinist--a Baptist!-a man who ought to be ashamed of himself for being so near the Church, and yet not within its pale?</Q>   <Q>Never mind; come and hear him.</Q>    Well, we went yesterday morning to the Music Hall, in the Surrey Gardens .... Fancy a congregation consisting of <num value="10000">10,000</num> souls, streaming into the hall, mounting the galleries, humming, buzzing, and swarming--a mighty hive of bees-eager to secure at <num value="1">first</num> the best places, and, at last, any place at all. After waiting more than half an hour-for if you wish to have a seat you must be there at least that space of time in advance-Mr. <pb id="P.268" n="268"> Spurgeon ascended his tribune. To the hum, and rush, and trampling of men, succeeded a low, concentrated thrill and murmur of devotion, which seemed to run at once, like an electric current, through the breast of every <num value="1">one</num> present, and by this magnetic chain the preacher held us fast bound for about <num value="2">two</num> hours. It is not my purpose to give a summary of his discourse. It is enough to say of his voice, that its power and volume are sufficient to reach every <num value="1">one</num> in that vast assembly; of his language, that it is neither high-flown, nor homely; of his style, that it is at times familiar, at times declamatory, but always happy, and often eloquent; of his doctrine, that neither the  <Q>Calvinist</Q>  nor the  <Q> Baptist</Q>  appears in the forefront of the battle which is waged by Mr. Spurgeon with relentless animosity, and with Gospel weapons, against irreligion, cant, hypocrisy, pride, and those secret bosom-sins which so easily beset a man in daily life; and to sum up all in a word, it is enough to say of the man himself, that he impresses you with a perfect conviction of his sincerity. But I have not written so much about my children's want of spiritual food when they listened to the mumbling of the Archbishop of        , and my own banquet at the Surrey Gardens, without a desire to draw a practical conclusion from these <num value="2">two</num> stories, and to point them by a moral. Here is a man not more Calvinistic than many an incumbent of the Established Church who  <Q> humbles and mumbles,</Q>  as old Latimer says, over his liturgy and text--here is a man who says the complete immersion, or something of the kind, of adults, is necessary to baptism. These are his faults of doctrine; but if I were the examining chaplain of the Archbishop of--, I would say,  <Q> May it please your grace, here is a man able to preach eloquently, able to fill the largest church in England with his voice, and, what is more to the purpose, with people. And may it please your grace, here are <num value="2">two</num> churches in the metropolis, St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey. What does your grace think of inviting Mr. Spurgeon, this heretical Calvinist and Baptist, who is able to draw <num value="10000">10,000</num> souls after him, just to try his voice, some Sunday morning, in the nave of either of those churches?</Q> </QUOTE> 
    <P>In <datestruct VALUE="1861-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>, shortly after being vacated by  Mr. Spurgeon, the Music Hall was destroyed by fire. It was, however, rebuilt, and for a time was occupied as a temporary hospital during the demolition of <LEMMA id="lemma.268.1">St. Thomas's Hospital</LEMMA> at London Bridge and the erection of the new building near Westminster Bridge. 
    <P>The old Manor House of Walworth is kept in remembrance by Manor Road and Manor Place, the last-named thoroughfare uniting Penton Place with Walworth Road. Close by, in Penrose Street, is a commodious lecture-hall, built in <datestruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></datestruct>, under the auspices of the Walworth Mechanics' Institute.  This institution was founded in <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>, in Manor  Place, and is the only literary and scientific institution on a large scale on the south side of the  Thames; the library contains some <num value="5000">5,000</num> volumes, and it has a reading-room in the Walworth Road. 
   <P>Since the commencement of the present century a considerable advance has been made in the way of buildings in this neighbourhood, particularly on the east side of the Walworth Road.   Lock's Fields, formerly a dreary swamp, and Walworth Common, which was at <num value="1">one</num> time an open field, have been covered with houses. In Paragon Row the Fishmongers' Company have erected several model dwellings, with the aim of benefiting a very poor locality.   The dwellings have been built on the <QUOTE>flat</QUOTE> system, realising as nearly as possible the idea of the cottage character, and replacing old and dilapidated houses of an inferior class. 
   <P>Whatever this locality may be in the present day, it has not been without its places of amusement in former times, for we learn from Colburn's <QUOTE>Kalendar of Amusements</QUOTE> for <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, that the Marylebone and Oxford cricket clubs played a match in that year at the <QUOTE>Beehive</QUOTE> grounds, Walworth. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct> the <num value="1">first</num> stone of St. Peter's Church, Walworth, was laid by the Archbishop of Canterbury, immediately after the performance of the like ceremony at Trinity Church, in this parish.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="253">253</num>.</NOTE>
The church, which is situated at a short distance on the eastern side of the Walworth Road, is built of brick, with the exception of the steeple and architectural ornaments, which are constructed of stone.   The basement is occupied by spacious catacombs. 
   <P>St. John's Church, which stands a short distance backward on the eastern side of the Walworth Road, near York Street, is a lofty and handsome Gothic building, in the Decorated style, and was erected in <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>, at a cost of upwards of <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure>. It was endowed by the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury, who are the patrons. 
   <P>Walworth is not entirely devoid of historical memorabilia, if tradition is to be trusted; a native of this village--for such it must have been in his day--was William Walworth, the celebrated Lord Mayor of London, who slew Wat Tyler with his own hand, and who, in memory of the deed, caused a dagger to be added to the arms of the City. <pb id="P.269" n="269">

<P>Camberwell is now so truly part and parcel of the metropolis that it would be impossible to write an account of London south of the Thames without some notice of its past and present history. No <num value="1">one</num>, we are told, can assert at what period the parish became an inhabited spot.   Local antiquaries find pleasure in tracking the path of the Roman conquerors of Britain across the hills and valleys which surround the metropolis.   Their legions, as we know, had various camps in the neighbourhood of Londinium, and it is not improbable that they formed <num value="1">one</num> on the pretty hill, known in later days as Ladlands, or Primrose Hill, best reached from Camberwell by way of Dog-kennel Lane, in the southern part of the parish. It must have been a commanding position in those days, when the Thames at high tide expanded into a vast lake, reaching to the base of the rounded Surrey hills, near which were marshes inhabited by bitterns, herons, and other waterfowl. Herne Hill, in this neighbourhood, by the way, is thought by some to have been originally Heron Hill, <QUOTE>heron</QUOTE> being the old orthography. 
   <P>Coming down to times the history of which is more defined and authentic, we find Camberwell mentioned in Domesday Book as a manor of some value. The name is written <QUOTE>Ca'brewelle,</QUOTE> and the adjoining manor, Peckham, is described as <QUOTE>Pecheha.</QUOTE> In subsequent records we meet with <QUOTE>Camerwell,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Cambwell,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>Kamwell.</QUOTE> Some etymologists trace the <num value="1">first</num> portion of the name to the British <hi rend=italics>owm hir</hi>, long valley; and suppose that the last syllable has reference to some springs of water, at <num value="1">one</num> time famous. This may be the case, for there are, or were, mineral springs at Dulwich, Norwood (the Beulah Spa is memorable), and other places in the neighbourhood. It may be added that, as the parish church has been dedicated from   Saxon times to St. Giles, the especial patron of cripples, it has been suggested that there were certain springs in the neighbourhood possessing salutary virtues for persons so afflicted; and that as the old British word <hi rend=italics>cam</hi>
signifies <QUOTE>crooked,</QUOTE> Camberwell may simply mean <QUOTE>the well of the crooked.</QUOTE> Within the last century or so <num value="3">three</num> ancient wells were discovered in a field in the parish, but they were covered in again by the owner of the land. 
   <P>At the time of the Conquest, Camberwell is described as being <QUOTE>large and well inhabited.</QUOTE> Its inhabitants were cottars and men of a lower grade, ceorls or churls. There was so much wood and waste ground in the neighbourhood that the lord of the manor had paid to him a rent of <num value="60">sixty</num> fat hogs, which were fed on the beech-masts and acorns which abounded in the neighbourhood.   There were, besides, <num value="63">sixty-three</num> acres of meadow-land, and, as we have said, a church. In the Saxon times there was but <num value="1">one</num> manor here, which was held of Edward the Confessor by Haims, <QUOTE>Viscount,</QUOTE> or Count Depute, of Brixton <num value="100">Hundred</num>, or, as some writers have it, Sheriff of Surrey. Somewhat later we hear of the manor of Pecheha, or Peckham, being granted to William's half-brother, Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, who sub-let to the Bishop of Lisieux. There were also other manors of Bretynghurst, Dovedale (D&lsquo;Ovedale, or Dowdale), Camberwell, Frierne, Basyng, Hatcham, Cold Herbergh, and Milkwell. William, Earl of Gloucester, natural son of Henry I., who possessed a portion of the original Camberwell manor, including Peckham, gave the church to the monks of Bermondsey, but the manor remained in the family until the year <datestruct value="1350"><year reg="1350">1350</year></datestruct>.   Margaret, daughter and heiress of Hugh, the then earl, married Ralph, the <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Stafford, whose descendant became Duke of Buckingham. The manor was then named Camberwell- Buckingham, and remained the property of the family until Edward, Duke of Buckingham, was attainted and beheaded in <datestruct value="1521--"><year reg="1521">1521</year></datestruct>.   After passing through various hands, it was purchased in <datestruct value="1583--"><year reg="1583">1583</year></datestruct> by <num value="1">one</num> Edmund Bowyer, whose descendants yet retain a considerable portion of it. The manors of Bretynghurst, Basyng, and Dovedale were so named from   their original possessors, and the brethren of the hospital of St. Thomas, Southwark, held the manor of Milkwell, and subsequently granted it to the church of St. Mary Overie. <pb id="P.270" n="270"> After the suppression of religious houses it was granted to Sir Thomas Wyatt, who, as we know, was beheaded for his attempted rebellion, in the <num value="1">first</num> year of Queen Mary's reign. 
   <P>The main road from   Kent, intersecting   the eastern portion of the parish, was known in the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century as Bretynghurst or Dredynghurst Road; and afterwards as Kinges Street, because along that thoroughfare the royal and state processions passed on their way from Kent to London and Westminster. 
   <P>Camberwell is described by Priscilla Wakefield, in her <QUOTE>Perambulations,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, as a <QUOTE>pleasant retreat for those citizens who have a taste for the country whilst their avocations daily call them to town.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In the Domesday Book this parish is called <QUOTE>Ca'berwelle.</QUOTE> Subsequently the letter <hi rend=italics>b</hi> was changed, and from the <num value="11">eleventh</num> to the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century the name of the parish is generally written in official documents as Camwell, Cammerwell, or Camerwell.   In the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, as Mr. Blanch informs us in his <QUOTE>History of the Parish,</QUOTE> the <hi rend=italics>b</hi> found its way back again; but it was not until the middle of the eighteenth century that 
<FIGURE id="Fig.270" n="2000.14.0099"><HEAD>Old Camberwell Church In <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 Camberwell, as it is now written, was officially and locally recognised.   Lysons, in his <QUOTE>Environs of London,</QUOTE> writes, <QUOTE>I can find nothing satisfactory with respect to its etymology; the termination seems to point out some remarkable spring; a part of the parish is called Milkwell, and a mineral water was discovered some years ago [<datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>] near Dulwich.</QUOTE> There was formerly a fine brick well on the De Crespigny estate, on Denmark Hill; but Dr. Lettsom, whose villa on Grove Hill we shall have occasion to notice presently, laid claim to the honour of possessing in his grounds the identical well from which this parish derived its appellation. Salmon, the Surrey historian, says, <QUOTE>It seems to be named from some mineral water which was anciently in it;</QUOTE> and Bray adopts the same idea. The author of <QUOTE>A Short Historical and Topographical Account of St. Giles's Church</QUOTE> the parish church of Camberwell-writes, <QUOTE>It has been conjectured that, as the name of St. Giles conveys an idea of cripples, the well which gave part of the name to the village might have been famous for some medicinal virtues, and might have occasioned the dedication of the church to this patron saint of cripples and mendicants.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>This <pb id="P.271" n="271"> interpretation,</QUOTE> adds Mr. Blanch, <QUOTE>is not by any means an improbable <num value="1">one</num>, and it assists us somewhat in the solution of the <num value="1">first</num> part of the name. Given the well, it does not call for a violent exercise of our imaginative faculties to suppose it to be  <Q>cambered</Q>  over for protection.      Again,  <Q>cam </Q> is a very crooked word, and is applied to anything   out of square, or out of condition. Having   regard, therefore, to   the   fact already noticed, that the church is dedicated to the patron saint of cripples, we are certainly justified in assuming the word  <Q>cam</Q>  to be in this instance descriptive of individual condition; and the well would then become the well of the  <Q>crooked</Q>  or crippled.</QUOTE> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.271" n="2000.14.0100"><HEAD>Bowyer House.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
   <P>Other solutions of the etymology of Camberwell have been advanced. Here is <num value="1">one</num> by the author of <QUOTE>London: How it Grew :</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>All honour to St. Giles, whose miraculous springs gave a name to the spot; unless, indeed, our friends in the parish will accept a theory of our own--that, as Camber was the name of a son of the Trojan Brute who is said to have conquered this tight little island about <num value="4000">4,000</num> years ago, perhaps that prince discovered the wells, as Prince Bladud did the waters of Bath, and so unwittingly handed his name down to posterity and the panels of omnibuses.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The name of the place is often pronounced as <QUOTE>Camerwell,</QUOTE> and is so written by Evelyn.   Under date of <datestruct VALUE="1657-09-1"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1657>1657</year></datestruct>, the diarist writes, <QUOTE>I <pb id="P.272" n="272"> visited Sir Edmund Bowyer at his melancholic seate at <hi rend=italics>Camerwell</hi>.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Evelyn mentions in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> in <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>, an urn full of bones, which had been dug up at Camberwell in repairing a highway, being exhibited at a meeting of the Royal Society, for at that date the Society of Antiquaries did not exist; <QUOTE>it was found,</QUOTE> he tells us, <QUOTE>entire with its cover, amongst many others believed to be truly Roman and ancient.</QUOTE> No doubt, in the present day a more exact account would have been placed on record. 
   <P>The most ancient part of the village is that which surrounds what till lately was the Green; but the more pleasant and favourite spot is the Grove, which stands high, and commands pleasant views over Dulwich, as we shall presently see. Of the old sites of Camberwell very few now remain. In the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> and <num value="17">seventeenth</num> centuries there were many good houses in the parish.   The Scotts, who held the manor of Camberwell, had a noble mansion and fine grounds at the foot of the Grove. The Muschamps, who possessed   the Peckham estate, lived in the manor-house near the High Street. The house was pulled down in the reign of Charles II. by Sir Thomas Bond, who, in <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>, 
<LEMMA id="lemma.272.1">built on the site a very fine mansion</LEMMA>, surrounded by a tastefully laid-out garden, famed for the number of its foreign fruit-trees, which attracted the notice of John Evelyn, who, it may be presumed, frequently walked over, being a friend of the family, from his residence at Saye's Court. 
    <P>He speaks of it as <QUOTE>a new and fine house by  Peckham.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>It stands,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>on a flat; but has a fine garden and prospect through the meadows to London.</QUOTE> The house had a north frontage, and was approached under a canopy of stately elms, <QUOTE>at the end of which was a beautiful prospect, terminated by a view of St. Paul's and the  Tower of London. The beauties of this prospect were greatly increased by the masts of the ships being seen over the trees as far as Greenwich.</QUOTE> The centre of the garden was, it is stated, like <QUOTE>a wilderness</QUOTE> --a name by which the place was known down till the early part of the present century.  Bond was a devoted adherent of the Stuarts, and, at the abdication of James II., followed his master to France. His house was plundered by the Whig mob, and his beautiful gardens laid waste.   In <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct> the house was pulled down. Many houses built on the site of Sir Thomas Bond's gardens are now known as Hill Street. 
    <P>The Bowyer family, who occupy a distinguished place in the annals of Camberwell, settled there in the time of Henry VIII.   The family mansion, the manor-house of Camberwell-Buckingham, which stood on the right-hand side of the road from London to Camberwell Green, was built apparently about the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Evelyn, as stated above, in recording a visit paid to Sir Edmund Bowyer, speaks of his mansion as a <QUOTE>melancholie seate.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>He has,</QUOTE> says the author of <QUOTE>Sylva,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>a very pretty grove of oakes, and hedges of yew in his garden, and a handsome row of tall elms before his court.</QUOTE> These trees were specially noticeable from the high road. <QUOTE>No vestige of the elms or oaks,</QUOTE> says Mr. Blanch, <QUOTE>have been seen by the  <Q>oldest inhabitant,</Q>  but a ring of yew-trees stood round the front lawn very recently. It will be noticed,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>that Evelyn says nothing of the fine cedar which, at the beginning of the present century, formed a conspicuous feature to the left of the grand entrance.</QUOTE> 
    <P>There is a tradition that Sir Christopher Wren resided here during the rebuilding of St. Paul's Cathedral, and that some of the frescoes with which the rooms were adorned were painted by Sir James Thornhill.   It is also asserted that James II. was concealed here for some time previous to his escape. 
    <P>Early in the present century much of the beauty of the interior of Bowyer House was destroyed, the owner removing several choice carvings and ornaments. A   substantial wall and iron railings were erected about the same time. Later on, the old mansion became tenanted by the Camberwell  Literary and Scientific Institution; and it was subsequently converted into a school for young ladies. The house was pulled down in <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>, on its being purchased by the London, Chatham, and  Dover Railway Company.   Bowyer Lane, now  Wyndham Road, long preserved the memory of the old family.   This thoroughfare forms a connecting link between the Old and New Camberwell  Roads, and is near the boundary line between the parishes of Camberwell and Newington. Freeman's  Mill (see page <num value="276">276</num>), close by Bowyer Lane, was a picturesque old wooden building, and was formerly a conspicuous parochial boundary-mark. Early in the present century Bowyer Lane was the abode of questionable characters of all sorts. Greenacre lived here in <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>-the year of the murder now associated with his name; and it is stated that the body of a man who was executed for horse-stealing was for some time exhibited by the family living in Bowyer Lane at a shilling a head. 
    <P>The Royal Flora Gardens, in the Wyndham  Road, formed for some time a favourite resort for the pleasure-seekers of South London during the summer months. Their most prosperous period was about the year <datestruct value="1849"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>, when the gardens were <pb id="P.273" n="273"> well laid out and brilliantly illuminated; but the reputation of the place speedily declined, and it met the fate of all such speculations. 
    <P>The old church, dedicated to St. Giles, was an antique and rude structure, the body large and shapeless, with a square tower surmounted by a turret. It is described by Priscilla Wakefield, in the year <datestruct value="1809"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, as <QUOTE>an ancient structure, though its appearance has been much modernised by coats of plaster and rough-cast. The south aisle,</QUOTE> she adds, <QUOTE>was greatly enlarged lately by an additional brick building, and the whole has been repaired and ornamented.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The <num value="1">first</num> church of Camberwell is <num value="1">one</num> of the very few of which we have authentic mention in <QUOTE>Domesday Book,</QUOTE> and is considered by some to have dated its erection from within <num value="60">sixty</num> years of the <num value="1">first</num> landing of St. Augustine, or about the middle of the <num value="7">seventh</num> century.   In the reign of  King Stephen, <datestruct value="1152--"><year reg="1152">1152</year></datestruct>, the original structure underwent extensive changes, and <num value="2">two</num> years afterwards became subject to the abbey of St. Saviour, Bermondsey, by gift of William de Mellent.   It has been conjectured by some topographers that portions of this church existed down to the time of its destruction by fire in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>. Lysons, however, fixes the date of the old building towards the beginning of the reign of Henry VIII., at which period the entire edifice was either so completely altered as to lose its original character, or rebuilt on the site of the former church, which had been granted to the monks of Bermondsey.   In confirmation of this view Mr. Blanch states that, in preparing the foundation of the new church, the foundations of <num value="2">two</num> former structures were distinctly visible. 
    <P>The old church was a large edifice, with a <QUOTE>lady chapel,</QUOTE> and contained many interesting monuments, brasses, and painted windows.   It would be difficult to estimate the amount spent at different times in altering, enlarging, beautifying, and repairing St. Giles's Church, from the time when the <num value="1">first</num> entry occurs in the vestry minutes in <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>; for from that date down to the time of its destruction by fire in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, the condition of the church appears to have been the principal theme discussed by the parishioners <QUOTE>in vestry assembled.</QUOTE> Under date of <datestruct VALUE="1675-09-14"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=14>14</day>, <year reg=1675>1675</year></datestruct>, the following entry appears on the vestry records :-- <QUOTE>Upon examination of the charges for the repairing the parish church, it was consented to and ordered, that the sum of  <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">Fifty</num> pounds</measure> be raysed forthwith by way of tax for that purpose, and the payment of some arreares due for former reparations which was allowed, and to be included in this tax of <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure>, and to be paid accordingly, and to be brought on account in the churchwardens' accounts, as also that the present churchwardens shall give an account how the sum of <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure>   hath been expended.</QUOTE> This sum, it appears, was found insufficient for the repairs, and so in <datestruct value="1679--"><year reg="1679">1679</year></datestruct> an order was made for an additional <measure value="40l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40">40</num></measure>, <QUOTE>for mending the seats, bells, and windows, and for buying prayer-books and a surplice;</QUOTE> and soon after another sum of <measure value="40l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40">40</num></measure> was voted for a new church clock <QUOTE>and other expenses.</QUOTE> There is mention also in <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct> of an agreement entered into between Antony Bowyer, Esq., and Richard Kettlethorpe, whereby the latter undertook to keep St. Giles's clock <QUOTE>going and in good order</QUOTE> for the sum of <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure> yearly; but Richard Kettlethorpe apparently found it a more difficult undertaking than he imagined, for, as stated above, a new clock was ordered about <num value="4">four</num> years later. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct> a gallery was built; in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct> the church was <QUOTE>new pewed, paved, and glazed; <num value="3">three</num> new galleries were erected, and a vault was sunk.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct> further additions were made; and in <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct> the building was <QUOTE>beautified,</QUOTE> after the usual fashion so dear to vestries and churchwardens; and as parish officers in those days were wholly ignorant of ecclesiastical art, the effect was not brilliant.  In <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct> the church was greatly enlarged. 
    <P>Notwithstanding   these   various   repairs   and alterations, the old church retained much of its antiquarian character to the last.   The massive clustered columns and pointed arches separating the nave from the side aisles, the venerable sedilia in the south wall of the chancel-which, by the way, had been for many years concealed behind some wainscoting put up in <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct> by the Bowyers-and the fragments of ancient stained   glass in its windows, were all vestiges of the olden time. 
    <P>A fire broke out on the night of Sunday, the <datestruct VALUE="1841-02-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, by which the building was completely destroyed. Funds were at once raised for its re-erection. The <num value="1">first</num> stone of the new church was laid   in   <datestruct VALUE="1842-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>, and   in  <datestruct VALUE="1844-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>, the new building was consecrated by the Bishop of Winchester. It was erected from the designs of Messrs. George Gilbert Scott and W.  B. Moffatt, at an expense, including furniture, &amp;c., of about <measure value="24000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="24000">24,000</num></measure>.   It is <num value="1">one</num> of the finest and largest of the new parish churches in the kingdom.  The style of architecture is the transition between the Early English and the Decorated, which prevailed at the close of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century. The building is of a cruciform plan, with a central tower and spire, the latter rising to the height of about <num value="210">210</num> feet. The walls of the church, which are of considerable   thickness, are constructed <pb id="P.274" n="274"> chiefly of Kentish rag, with dressings of Caen stone. Several of the windows are enriched with stained glass. 
    <P>In the old church there was a handsome effigy in brass of Edward Scott, who died in <datestruct value="1537--"><year reg="1537">1537</year></datestruct>. It is engraved in Hone's <QUOTE>Year-Book,</QUOTE> page <num value="913">913</num>.  There was also a monument to Agnes Skinner, or  Skuner, who died in <datestruct value="1515--"><year reg="1515">1515</year></datestruct>, at the age of <num value="119">119</num>, having survived her husband, it is said, no less than ninetytwo years! 
   <P>The churchwardens' accounts contain several very curious entries. Thus, in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, Mr. Churchwarden Baker paid <QUOTE>John Wilkins, for a vagabond, <measure value="3s. 10d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="10">10</num>d.</measure> ;</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>for carrying a vagabond to church, <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> ;</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>paid for a coffin and shroud for him, <measure value="6s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure></QUOTE> The bishop, it seems, was usually regaled with <QUOTE>biscuits and wine</QUOTE> when he came to preach at Camberwell; but in the above-mentioned year, Mr. Churchwarden   Davis makes the following entry: <QUOTE>Paid for meat and drink for the bishop, <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure></QUOTE> 
   <P>Among the notabilities buried here is Mrs. Wesley, the somewhat shrewish wife of the Rev. John Wesley, who died in <datestruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct>. A stone in the churchyard asserts her to have been <QUOTE>a woman of exemplary virtue, a tender parent, and a sincere friend.</QUOTE> The monument says nothing   of her excellence as a wife; for it is on record that, after making her husband thoroughly miserable, and having been a <QUOTE>thorn in his flesh</QUOTE> for <num value="20">twenty</num> years, she left his house, carrying off her husband's papers and journals, which she never returned.   John Wesley never saw her, nor sought to see her, again. <QUOTE>By her outrageous jealousy and abominable temper,</QUOTE> writes Southey, in his <QUOTE>Life of Wesley,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>she deserves to be classed in a triad with Xanthippe and the wife of Job, as <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> bad wives.</QUOTE> Her death must have been a happy release for the great John. It appears that more than <num value="1">one</num> separation took place between them. On different occasions she laid hands upon his person and tore his hair. When in the north of Ireland, a friend of Wesley's caught her in the act of trailing him on the floor by the hair of his head. <QUOTE>I felt,</QUOTE> continues Hampson, in his account of the incident, <QUOTE>that I could have knocked the very soul out of her.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In the churchyard, too, lies Miss Lucy Warner, better known as the <QUOTE>Little Woman of Peckham.</QUOTE> Her height was exactly <num value="32">thirty-two</num> inches, her growth having been stunted at the early age of <num value="3">three</num>. She kept a school. In the newer part of the churchyard a handsome tomb covers the remains of the notorious democrat, well known as <QUOTE>Equality Brown,</QUOTE> of Peckham; and a gravestone also commemorates James Blake, who sailed round the world with Captain Cook. 
   <P>Camden Chapel, situated on the northern side of Peckham   Road, was built in <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>, and duly licensed as an Episcopal Chapel in <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>. Under the ministry of the late Rev. Henry Melvill, who occupied the pulpit for many years, it became <num value="1">one</num> or tne most famous places of worship in the metropolis for pulpit oratory of a high order. So great was Mr. Melvill's popularity, that very soon after his appointment, it was found necessary to make a considerable enlargement in the building, and transepts were made at the north end, thus giving to the edifice the ground-plan of the letter T. A writer in a critique on Camden Chapel and its pastor, in the <QUOTE>Metropolitan   Pulpit</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>), remarks: <QUOTE>The Rev. Henry Melvill, of Camden Chapel, is the most popular preacher in London. I am doing no injustice to other ministers, whether in the Church or out of it, in saying this. The fact is not only susceptible of proof, but is often proved in a manner which all must admit to be conclusive.   When a sermon is advertised to be preached by Mr. Melvill, the number of strangers attracted to the particular place is invariably greater than is ever drawn together in the same church or chapel when any of the other popular ministers in London are appointed to preach on a precisely similar occasion.</QUOTE> Mr. Melvill, who was subsequently recto- of Barnes, died in <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>, and was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral, of which he had been for some years a canon residentiary. 
   <P>A new district church, dedicated to St. George, on the south bank of the Surrey Canal, after the model of <num value="1">one</num> of the churches in Rome, was built about <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>. There are few churches in or near London which have witnessed more extraordinary changes in their immediate neighbourhood than this. Originally built among green fields, with a windmill close at hand, it now   stands in the midst of a teeming population. The edifice, which is in the Grecian style of architecture, was built from the designs of Mr. Bedford. A new bridge over the Surrey Canal, close by the church, was erected in the year <datestruct value="1862"><year reg="1862">1862</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>Previous to <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, the parochial business was carried on either at the workhouse or the vestryroom of St. Giles's Church. In that year was erected a vestry-hall, which was in use for a little over <num value="40">forty</num> years. The building, however, seems to have been ill adapted for the transaction of parochial business, and in <datestruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct> it was superseded by a new hall, a large and imposing edifice on the north side of old Church Street, at the corner of Havil Street, and occupying the site of old Havil House. The style <pb id="P.275" n="275"> of architecture is that known as Renaissance, and the general arrangement of the design is a centre with <num value="2">two</num> wings. The principal front is constructed entirely of Bath stone, and the side front of white Suffolk bricks, with cornices, string-courses, &amp;c. The principal front is divided into <num value="2">two</num> storeys, the lowermost of which has considerable dignity imparted to it by reason of its being raised some <num value="4">four</num> feet above the level of the roadway. On the ground storey, the centre has rusticated piers, with Doric granite columns and a recessed portico, leading up to which is a flight of stone steps, with ornamental pillar-lamps on each side. The upper storey consists of coupled Ionic pilasters, with a central composition comprising a circular-headed window, flanked by <num value="2">two</num> narrow recessed openings, and an elliptical projecting balcony; the whole is surmounted by an attic having a pedimented clock-storey, on either side of which are groups of statuary representing <QUOTE>Law</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>Prudence,</QUOTE> while a figure of <QUOTE>Justice</QUOTE> crowns the summit of the pediment. On the pedestals of the balustrades, over each group of coupled pilasters, are also emblematical figures of <QUOTE>Science</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>Industry.</QUOTE> The roof of this central portion of the building is of ornamental design, with a balustrade. Each of the wings of the main front is divided into <num value="3">three</num> openings on both sides. 
   <P>At the western end of Church Street and the southern end of Camberwell Road is an oblong plot of ground, rather over an acre in extent-laid out in grass-plats, planted with trees, shrubs, and flowers, and enclosed with iron railings-rejoicing in the name of Camberwell Park. This spot, formerly known as Camberwell Green, was in bygone times the scene of an annual fair, almost rivalling in riotousness that at Greenwich, which we have already described.<NOTE>See p. <num value="202">202</num>.</NOTE>

   <P>How, or at what time, Camberwell Fair became established is a matter of uncertainty. Bray, in his <QUOTE>History of Surrey,</QUOTE> says that it was appointed to be held on the gth of August, and to terminate on the ist of September--the feast of St. Giles, the patron saint; thus it must have lasted for twentythree days. In recent times, however, it was held on the <num value="18">18th</num>, <num value="19">19th</num>, and <datestruct VALUE="-08-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>.   The fair appears to have been held in the High Street, <QUOTE>opposite  <Q>The Cock</Q>  public-house,</QUOTE> before the Green was fixed upon as its head-quarters. 
   <P>The following account of these saturnalia is taken from the <QUOTE>Annual Register,</QUOTE> <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct> :--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>The sports of Camberwell Fair began, and were continued till Thursday, the <num value="20">20th</num>, with more animation than usual.   An unlucky accident happened on Wednesday to a black magician, who professed to be acquainted with the secrets of nature, to be de. scended from   the magi of Persia, and to profess the highest veneration for the Greubes or worshippers of fire. In addition to his legerdemain, he exhibited a puppet-show, in the last scene of which a battle was introduced   between   Lucifer and Buonaparte.   As the infernal king was conveying the effigy of the Corsican to the region of fire, an unlucky boy blew up a sausage-pan in the rear of the magician's booth, and Buonaparte's catastrophe was attended by real fire, for the flames, in consequence of the explosion, caught the hangings of the booth, and the disciple of Zoroaster found himself inclosed   by the element he so much admired.   In vain he summoned water to his aid; none could be obtained, and he was compelled to bury the devil, &amp;c., in the ruins. Fortunately, the flames did not communicate to the adjoining shows, but the magician was necessitated to begin his incantations <foreign lang=la>de novo></foreign>.</QUOTE>

Richardson's theatre occupies a large space of ground in the centre of the Green, and is fitted up with a degree of splendour we could not have anticipated. Alger's  <Q> Crown and Anchor</Q>  tavern, as usual, eclipses all others of its contemporaries; it ranges from <num value="1">one</num> end of the Green to the other, and its interior is ornamented with chandeliers, variegated lamps, flags, banners, &amp;c., which present a very splendid effect. There are numerous other sources of amusement to satiate the appetites of the public, and the Bonifaces anticipate a plentiful harvest should the weather but prove congenial.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The following curious particulars of Camberwell Fair are taken from Colburn's <QUOTE>Kalendar of Amusements</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>) :--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Camberwell Fair is <num value="1">one</num> of the most amusing and   orderly occurring near the metropolis.

The green is filled with booths, displaying articles of <hi rend=italics>virtu</hi> and <hi rend=italics>taste</hi> (corn-craiks and gingerbread); with theatres which preserve the legitimate drama with a commendable fidelity, admitting no other change of performances than from   <hi rend=italics>Douglas</hi> to <hi rend=italics>Hamlet</hi>, and from <hi rend=italics>Hamlet</hi> to 
<hi rend=italics>Douglas</hi>; and with   shows of wonderful objects, <pb id="P.276" n="276"> which Nature continues to produce in order, most probably, to keep alive that spirit of curiosity in man which works so beneficially for that portion of society called the <hi rend=italics>Hamaxobii</hi>, or cart-dwellers.

The complaints of the inhabitants against the continuance of the fair were both loud and numerous; but it nevertheless survived, and was allowed to bring annual annoyance to the district till <datestruct VALUE="1855-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>,  <year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>, in which month the Green was encumbered for the last time with these disreputable gatherings.  In that year the manorial rights in the Green were purchased by a subscription raised among the principal inhabitants of the district, and the place was transformed into a park, as above stated. 
   <P>At the end of Camberwell Road, close by the park, is an inn called the <QUOTE>Father Redcap ;</QUOTE> this hostelry, however, has no connection with the <QUOTE>Mother Redcap</QUOTE> of Camden Town,<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="310">310</num>.</NOTE> or other places, but was probably only a flight of some publican's fancy. 
   <P>There formerly stood on the south side of the Green a curious old mansion, which in its time had, doubtless, been the subject of many an idle tale. It was for many years known as the <QUOTE>old house on the Green.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The house itself,</QUOTE> as Mr. Blanch tells us in his work before referred to, <QUOTE>was a fine specimen of a country mansion, and stood alone in its grandeur, as though it had found its way to Camberwell by mistake, so different was it from the surrounding buildings.   Its magnificent hall was adorned with frescoes on walls and ceilings by the famous artist, Sir James Thornhill, and the noble oak staircase was of great width, and beautifully carved.   The dining and drawing rooms were of unusual proportions, and elaborately worked medallion and other decorations were profusely arrayed. Tradition fixes this spot as the residence of Sir Christopher Wren, apparently without any authority, although local nomenclature has come to the rescue of tradition by naming the road which now occupies the site of this ancient structure as Wren Road.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The north side of the park is occupied chiefly by the Green-coat and National Schools.   The building, which was erected in <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>, stands on the site of a former school, founded in <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, by Mr. Henry Cornelisen, <QUOTE>for the Christian instruction of poor children.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The Camberwell Free Grammar School, which dated its foundation from the reign of James I., has become a thing of the past.   It was instituted by the Rev. Edward Wilson, Vicar of Camberwell, and the rules and regulations drawn up by him are quaint and peculiar.   The master, we are told, was to be <QUOTE>chosen out of the founder's kindred before any others;</QUOTE> he was to be <QUOTE>sound in religion, body, and mind; gentle, sober, honest, virtuous, discreet, and approved for a good facility in teaching--if such a <num value="1">one</num> may be gotten!</QUOTE> The master was enjoined <QUOTE>to be careful of the behaviour of the scholars in coming in, going out, and sitting; and especially in repetition for good grace, countenance, pronunciation, and carriage, &amp;c.; reverence abroad of scholars to their betters, elders, &amp;c.; behaviour, courteous speech, and fair condition required, and reformation of such as do amiss.</QUOTE> For all these varied duties and accomplishments the master was to receive <QUOTE>for his stipend, <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> yearly,</QUOTE> and the best scholar was to <QUOTE>welcome him with a Latin oration.</QUOTE> Whatever the school may have been in its early days, it does not appear to have been in a very flourishing condition at the commencement of the present century.   In <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct> the governors sold and conveyed to the Charity Commissioners a portion of the charity-land as an addition to the churchyard of the parish; and in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct> an information was filed in the Court of Chancery against the governors and   the then master of the school, with respect to its past and future management. In consequence of these proceedings, in <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct> the school buildings were razed to the ground, and for nearly eighteen years the land on which they stood was let out for grazing purposes.   In <datestruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct> another application was made to the Charity Commissioners, under the Charitable Trusts Act, on behalf of certain parishioners of Camberwell, which resulted in the whole of the funds of the charity being absorbed by the official trustees of Charitable Funds. 
   <P>In Westmoreland Place, contiguous to the main road, is the Aged Pilgrims' Friend Asylum.   Of the many valuable institutions with which London abounds, few deserve a higher place in the estimation of the philanthropist (though few are less known) than the Aged Pilgrims' Friend Society, of which we have already had occasion to speak in our account of Upper Holloway.<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="395">395</num>.</NOTE>   It was established in the year <datestruct value="1807"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, for the purpose of giving life-pensions of <num value="10">ten</num> guineas and <num value="5">five</num> guineas per annum   to poor, aged, and infirm   Protestants of either sex, and of every denomination.

    <P>The rural character of Carberwell at the latter part of the eighteenth century may be gathered from the fact that the trees and hedges of the village are alluded to in the vestry minutes; and in <datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct> caterpillars so abounded in the parish, that the overseers spent <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> in <QUOTE>apprehending them,</QUOTE> at the rate of sixpence per bushel. The caterpillars were described as being dangerous to the public in general. <QUOTE>The Camberwell Beauty,</QUOTE> the delight of entomologists, is still <num value="1">one</num> of the finest butterflies of the season; but it is now rarely seen. It was most abundant when Camberwell was a straggling suburban parish of about <num value="4000">4,000</num> inhabitants. But  Camberwell is now a congeries of streets, and forms part of the great metropolis itself. 
   <P>Close by the Camberwell Station of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, stood Myatt's Farm, a picturesque building in the midst of gardens, celebrated for their strawberries as lately as the present reign. Camberwell, in fact, was, down to a comparatively recent date, famous for its flowers and fruit.   In Cold Harbour Lane, which leads from the southern end of the High Street towards Brixton, are still located <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> well-known florists. In this lane was Strawberry Hall, now pulled down to form a site for Loughborough Park Chapel; beyond this was the <QUOTE>river</QUOTE> Effra, which, having been diverted from its original channel, or otherwise effaced, is now kept in remembrance by a modern thoroughfare called Effra Road.   Cold Harbour--a name by no means rare in the rural districts--is supposed to have originally signified a place of entertainment for travellers and drovers who required rest for their horses or cattle. 
   <P>At the foot of Denmark Hill, or rather at the fork made by the junction of that road with Cold Harbour Lane, stood Denmark Hill Grammar School, <QUOTE>a handsome and imposing structure,</QUOTE> with its extensive grounds skirting the parish boundary, and which <QUOTE>was reckoned among the 
<hi rend=italics>maisons grandes</hi> of Camberwell.</QUOTE> The grounds were enclosed by a high brick wall; and the house itself, which faced Denmark Hill, stood only a few yards from   the road. It was a lofty structure, built of red and white bricks, with dressings of Portland stone, and the interior contained some curious and quaint carvings and frescoes. 
   <P>At the beginning of the present century there lived at Grove Hill Dr. John Lettsom, <num value="1">one</num> of the most extraordinary men of his day. As a Quaker physician he was most successful, realising sometimes as much as   <measure value="12000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="12000">12,000</num></measure> a year.   He was as liberal and philanthropic as he was wealthy. At Grove Hill he entertained some of the most eminent 
<hi rend=italics>literati</hi> of his time.   He used to sign his prescriptions <QUOTE>I. Lettsom.</QUOTE> This signature occasioned the following epigram- 
             <QUOTE REND=blockquote>When any patients call in haste,                   I physics, bleeds, and sweats &lsquo;em;                If after that they choose to die,                   Why, what cares I?                                  I let's &lsquo;em.</QUOTE>

    <P><LEMMA id="lemma.280.1">Dr. John Coakley Lettsom</LEMMA> was the son of a West Indian planter, and was born in the year <datestruct value="1744"><year reg="1744">1744</year></datestruct>. Having completed his education in England, he was apprenticed to a Yorkshire apothecary.   He afterwards returned to the West Indies, and settled as a medical practitioner at Tortola. After about <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> months, he again found his way into Europe.   In <datestruct value="1769--"><year reg="1769">1769</year></datestruct>, he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of London, and in the following year elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. Dr. Lettsom's rise in his profession was rapid; but whilst realising a handsome fortune, he was not forgetful of the wants of his needy brethren, and the poorer order of clergy and struggling literary men received from him not only gratuitous advice, but substantial aid; whilst his contributions to charitable institutions placed him in the front rank of earnest and practical philanthropists.   Dr. Lettsom   deserves also to be remembered as the original proprietor of the sea-bathing Infirmary at Margate, which dates from   <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct> or thereabouts.   Numerous anecdotes have been published about the celebrated physician, but the following will sufficiently illustrate his proverbial generosity, which we tell on the authority of Mr. Blanch :-- <QUOTE>As he was travelling on <num value="1">one</num> occasion in the neighbourhood of London, a highwayman stopped his carriage; but from the awkward and constrained manner of the intruder, the doctor correctly imagined the young man was somewhat of a novice in his new vocation, and that he was an outlaw more from necessity than from choice; and so it turned out.   The doctor interested himself in his behalf, and eventually obtained him a commission in the army.   On <num value="1">one</num> of his benevolent excursions, the doctor found his way into the squalid garret of a poor woman who had seen better days.   With the language and deportment of a lady, she begged the physician to give her a prescription. After inquiring carefully into her case, he wrote on a slip of paper to the overseers of the parish:  <Q>A shilling per diem for <pb id="P.280" n="280"> Mrs. Moreton.   Money, not physic, will cure her.</Q> </QUOTE> Unhappily, though Dr. Lettsom had been successful in his profession, his latter years were darkened with adversity. 
   <P>Dr. Lettsom's house is called by Priscilla Wakefield, in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>an elegant villa.</QUOTE> She is at the pains of describing it as follows:-- <QUOTE>The front is adorned with emblematical figures of Flora and the Seasons. <num value="1">One</num> of the chief ornaments of the house is a noble library, in which are tastefully disposed the busts of many distinguished literary characters. The gardens and pleasure-grounds are laid out in a pleasing manner, and display a variety of statues and   models   of ancient temples.   That of the Sibyls is on the model of <num value="1">one</num> at Tivoli, and is supported on the trunks of eighteen   oak-trees, around which are entwined ivy, virgin's bower, honeysuckle, and other climbing shrubs.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The author of <QUOTE>The British Traveller,</QUOTE> in describing the parish in <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct>, makes no mention of anybody or anything in Camberwell further than this, that it contained the residence of the <QUOTE>late famous Dr. Lettsom.</QUOTE> The house is described in Manning and Bray's <QUOTE>History of Surrey</QUOTE> as <QUOTE>standing on a considerable eminence, rising gradually for about <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a mile from the village of Camberwell, and passing through an avenue of elms retaining the name of Camberwell Grove, part of the plantations which belonged to the house that was Sir Thomas Bond's, and afterwards Lord Trevor's.</QUOTE> This, however, is more than doubtful, as Sir Thomas Bond's house was situated in Peckham, at least <num value="1">one</num> mile distant. 
   <P>Scott, the <QUOTE>bard of Amwell,</QUOTE> inscribed <num value="1">one</num> of his lesser poems to his hospitable friend, Dr. Lettsom; and Boswell, who was a frequent visitor at Grove Hill, in an ode to Charles Dilly, celebrated at once the beauties of the physician's country seat and its owner's humane disposition:--

    <P>Dr. Lettsom's house was subsequently occupied by Mr. Charles Baldwin, the proprietor of the St.

    <P>Camberwell Grove is said to be the spot on which George Barnwell murdered his uncle: an event which furnished Lillo with the plot of his tragedy.   Fountain Cottage--which was till very recently commemorated by Fountain   Terrace, a name which the Metropolitan   Board   of Works have thought fit to abolish--was fixed upon as the residence of the unfortunate uncle. A writer, at the commencement of the present century, informs his readers that <QUOTE>in the Grove (at Camberwell) was committed that tragic act, recorded by Lillo, in the drama of <hi rend=italics>George Barnwell</hi>.</QUOTE> And, again, in the <hi rend=italics>European   Magazine</hi> for <datestruct VALUE="1803-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, it is recorded that <QUOTE>at the fatal spot where this murder was committed rises a stream   of limpid water, which falls into the canal (at Fountain Cottage) through a vase on which a naiad, in ornamental stone, reclines.     It is this spring,</QUOTE> the   writer further tells us, with an amount of simplicity and ignorance which is charming, <QUOTE>which   gives the name of Camberwell to the village so called!</QUOTE> In the <QUOTE>Memoirs of George Barnwell, by a descendant of the family,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, the author, in purporting   to give <QUOTE>a full, true, and particular account</QUOTE> of the whole affair, fixes upon Camberwell Grove as the residence of the uncle and the scene of the murder.   Maurice, the historian of Hindostan, in his poem entitled <title>Grove Hill</title>, thus apostrophises this touching and romantic story:-- 
     <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Ye towering elms, on whose majestic brows 
       <L>A <num value="100">hundred</num> rolling years have shed their snows, 
       <L>Admit me to your dark, sequester'd reign,

       <L>No savage murderer with a gleaming blade- 
       <L>No <hi rend=italics>Barnwell</hi> to pollute your sacred shade!</QUOTE>
 
    <P>In the prologue to Lillo's tragedy, <QUOTE>as acted at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, by his Majesty's servants, in <datestruct value="1731--"><year reg="1731">1731</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> it is openly stated that the tragedy is based   upon   the   original ballad   of 
 <title>George Barnwell</title>:-- 
    <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Forgive us, then, if we attempt to show, 
      <L>In artless strains, a tale of private woe. 
      <L>A London &lsquo;prentice ruined is my theme, 
      <L>Drawn from the famed old song that bears his name.</QUOTE>
 According to Bishop Percy, the original ballad was printed at least as early as the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century.  In that production Barnwell's uncle is described as a wealthy grazier, dwelling in Ludlow:-- 
              <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=couplet><L>I an uncle have, 
                  <L>Who doth in Ludlow dwell; 
               <L>He is a grazier, which in wealth 
                  <L>Doth all the rest excel.</QUOTE>
 The ballad also describes the murder as having been committed in a wood near that town; and the  Ludlow Guide-book notices the circumstance as traditional there, and the very barn and homestead, a short distance on the left before entering Ludlow from the Hereford Road, are still pointed out as having been   the residence of the victim.   The ballad, however, lays the scene of Barnwell's dissipation in the metropolis. In Shoreditch lived  Mrs. Millwood, who led him astray:-- 
             <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=couplet><L>George Barnwell, then, quoth she, 
                  <L>Do thou to Shoreditch come,

                  <L>Next door unto the  <Q> Gun.</Q>  </QUOTE>
Readers of James Smith's <QUOTE>Rejected Addresses</QUOTE> will not forget how the wretched woman Millwood suggests to the profligate apprentice the murder of his wealthy but hard-hearted relative. The poet tells us:-- 
        <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=stanza><LG type=couplet><L>A pistol he got from his love,

          <L>&lsquo;There's Nunkey as fat as a hog, 
            <L>While I am as lean as a lizard; 
          <L>Here's at you, you stingy old dog!&lsquo; 
            <L>And he whips a big knife in his gizzard.

            <L>Quoth he, &lsquo;I would pummel and lain her well;

 <QUOTE>Lillo's drama,</QUOTE> writes the author of the History of Camberwell, <QUOTE>shows us the culprit, in companionship with his heartless seducer, led from a London prison to the scaffold; and Dr. Rimbault, writing in <datestruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct>, tells us that some few years since an old parochial parchment was said to have come to light, showing that George Barnwell had been the last criminal hanged at St. Martin'sin- the-Fields, before the Middlesex executions were, more generally than before, ordered at Tyburn; yet the ballad, of much older date than the play, says that Barnwell was not gibbeted there, but sent  <Q>beyond   seas,</Q>  where he subsequently suffered capital punishment for some fresh crime. In any case,</QUOTE> he adds, somewhat sceptically, <QUOTE>we must disclaim, on behalf of Camberwell, the <hi rend=italics>honour</hi> of the <hi rend=italics>Barnawell</hi> connection. If such a person ever did commit such a crime as that stated, no reliable evidence whatever has been produced to connect Camberwell with it.</QUOTE> 
    <P>A writer in Hone's <QUOTE>Every-day Book</QUOTE> remarks: -- <QUOTE>When Mr. Ross performed the character of George Barnwell, in <datestruct value="1752--"><year reg="1752">1752</year></datestruct>, the son of an eminent merchant was so struck with certain resemblances to his own perilous position (arising from the arts of a real Millwood), that his agitation brought on a dangerous illness, in the course of which he confessed his error, was forgiven by his father, and was furnished with the means of repairing the pecuniary wrongs he had privately done to his employer.   Mr. Ross says:  <Q>Though I never knew his name, nor saw him to my knowledge, I had, for <num value="9">nine</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> years, at my benefit, a note sealed up with <num value="10">ten</num></Q> guineas, with these words:--

   <P>In the last century, the Camberwell Tea Gardens, attached to a place of public entertainment called the Grove House, were largely patronised by the lads and lasses of the metropolis. The assemblyroom--which is now known as Camberwell Hallhas been the scene of many local balls, which can scarcely, however, be styled fashionable. Charles Dickens, in his <QUOTE>Sketches   by Boz,</QUOTE> gives an amusing account of a ball held here by certain <QUOTE>aspiring</QUOTE> local residents.   <hi rend=italics>Fetes</hi> of all kinds were held within the spacious grounds of Grove House.   With the Grove House Tavern is associated the history of the Camberwell Club, which, like all similar associations of the past century, was exclusively social. The club--which numbered among its members clergymen, lawyers, and <pb id="P.282" n="282"> merchants-held its meetings at this famous house of entertainment; and, as Mr. Blanch informs us, <QUOTE>snug dinners, stray balls, and quarterly feasts were the principal <hi rend=italics>duties</hi> which the members were called upon to perform; and right well did they acquit themselves, if report be true.</QUOTE> Political meetings were sometimes held here; and the march of <QUOTE>Citizen</QUOTE> Tierney's supporters thither in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct> forms the subject of a spirited engraving published   at the   time, beneath   which   is inscribed- 
  <QUOTE REND=blockquote>The glorious triumph shouting mobs proclaim,     And the thronged Grove House echoes back my fame.</QUOTE>
Mr. Tierney, the great friend of Charles James Fox, was elected M.P. for Southwark in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, and sat for that place in <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> Parliaments. In a broad-sheet published by Gilray, in <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>, he is represented as the <QUOTE>Friend of Humanity</QUOTE> --the same who was satirised by Canning, a short time previously, in the <QUOTE>Anti-Jacobin.</QUOTE> 
    <P>On the lower Spring-field, on the west side of the Grove, formerly stood the Camberwell Collegiate School, an establishment formed on the principles of King's College. The building was erected in <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, from the designs of Mr. Henry

 Roberts, the architect of the Fishmongers' Hall; it was somewhat in the Tudor style, constructed of white brick, with stone dressings, the principal feature being the cloister which faced the entrance. The school was opened in <datestruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct>, as a proprietary establishment, and for some time was moderately successful; but the proximity of Dulwich College and other educational establishments seriously impeded the progress of the college, and in <datestruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct> it was closed, and the land sold for building purposes. 
   <P>The dwellers in Camberwell, and especially in that region where it passes into the Grove, ought to feel grateful to Mr. William Black for the dignity and interest which he has conferred upon it in his romance of <QUOTE>Madcap Violet.</QUOTE> What Leigh Hunt, Thackeray, and other writers have done for the <QUOTE>Old Court Suburb</QUOTE> of Kensington, Mr. Black has done for this charming part of suburban London. The broad, tree-bordered slope of the Grove, where fine houses to the right and left are embowered among leaves, has been chosen by the author of <QUOTE>Madcap Violet</QUOTE> as the scene of some of the incidents narrated in that romance of modern life.

    <P>In Champion Hill, which extends from Camberwell to Lordship Lane, the nightingale is sometimes heard; and Hone, in his <QUOTE>Year-Book,</QUOTE> mentions that this bird was in full song here in <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>Hone's <QUOTE>Year-Book</QUOTE> also mentions the <QUOTE>Foxunder-the-Hill,</QUOTE> at the foot of Denmark Hill-then the Sunday resort of many town-immured beingsas being gradually surrounded by spruce villas, &amp;c.  He styles Herne Hill <QUOTE>the elysium of many of our merchants and traders. On the left,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>is a quiet lane, such as Byron would have loved, leading to Dulwich.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The <QUOTE>Fox-under-the-Hill</QUOTE> still remains a wellknown Camberwell sign, although the old tavern has been demolished to give place to <num value="1">one</num> more in accord with modern ideas. That the neighbourhood was at <num value="1">one</num> time the haunt of <QUOTE>Reynard</QUOTE> may be inferred from the fact that a thoroughfare close by is called Dog Kennel Lane. The tavern was formerly called <QUOTE>Little Denmark Hall,</QUOTE> there being at that time another house of entertainment known as <QUOTE>Great Denmark Hall,</QUOTE> which was subsequently converted into <num value="1">one</num> or more private houses. The <QUOTE>Fox-under-the-Hill</QUOTE> was formerly the starting-point of the Dulwich patrol. 
   <P>Of the <QUOTE>old families</QUOTE> of Camberwell not yet mentioned by us, we have the Cherrys, descended from the De Cheries of Picardy and Normandythe <num value="1">first</num> of the family who settled in Camberwell being Sir Francis Cherry, Queen Elizabeth's Ambassador to Russia in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, of whose proceedings an amusing account is given in the <QUOTE>Egerton Papers</QUOTE> as published by the Camden Society. We have again the De Crespignys, who came from France, as Protestant refugees, in the reign of William III., though they; did not settle in Camberwell until early in the eighteenth century. Champion Lodge, at the foot of Denmark Hill, was built in <datestruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct>, by Mr. Claude de Crespigny. In <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct>, the Prince of Wales visited Champion Lodge, and of course a great <hi rend=italics>fete</hi> was made on the occasion, and the owner of the house was soon afterwards made a baronet. The park had originally an area of about <num value="30">thirty</num> acres. The house, noticeable for the fine iron gates and the stately cedars in front, was pulled down in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, and the site is now occupied by rows of houses. Sir Claude de Crespigny was a Fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and married the gifted, as well as accomplished, daughter of Mr. J. Clarke, of Rigton, Derbyshire. It was this Lady de Crespigny who wrote the admirable lines which were placed over a grotto standing in the grounds of Champion Lodge, and dedicated to Contemplation. 
    <P>There were also the Drapers, who came from  Nottinghamshire--Robert Draper, of Camberwell, being page of the Jewel Office to Henry VIII.; and his nephew, Sir Christopher Draper, being  Lord   Mayor of London   in <datestruct value="1566--"><year reg="1566">1566</year></datestruct>-his   <num value="3">three</num> daughters marrying respectively, Sir W. Webbe,  Sir Wolstan   Dixie, and Sir H. Billingsley, all subsequently Lord Mayors in their turn. 
    <P>Of the <QUOTE>local worthies</QUOTE> of Camberwell not already referred to by us, we may mention the  Rev. Dr. Richard Parr, who was rector of this parish for <num value="38">thirty-eight</num> years, commencing with  <datestruct value="1653--"><year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>, and who was the chaplain and biographer of  Archbishop Usher; Dr. Chandler, a famous Nonconformist divine in the early part of the eighteenth century, whose theological writings excited great attention, and evoked the high commendations of  Archbishop Wake; and Dr. William   B. Collyer, who attained great fame as a preacher in the earlier part of the present century, 
    <P>Towards the close of the year <datestruct value="1840"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, Thomas Hood--the author of <QUOTE>The Song of the Shirt</QUOTE> took up his residence in Camberwell; the house to which he <num value="1">first</num> brought ,his family was No. <num value="8">8</num>, South Place, now <num value="18">18</num> , Canmberwell New Road. He afterwards removed to No. <num value="2">2</num>, Union Row (now <num value="266">266</num>, High Street), where he occupied the drawingroom   floor.      Hood, who was a real wit and humourist in the best sense of the word, was born in London in <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>.   His father was a native of Scotland, and for many years acting partner in the firm of Vernor, Hood, and Sharpe, extensive booksellers and publishers. <QUOTE>There was a dash of ink in my blood,</QUOTE> he writes; <QUOTE>my father wrote <num value="2">two</num> novels, and my brother was decidedly of a literary turn, to the great disquietude, for a time, of an anxious parent.</QUOTE> Young Hood finished his education at Wanostrocht's Academy, at Camberwell; and removed thence to a merchant's counting-house in the City, where he realised his own inimitable sketch of the boy <QUOTE>Just set up in Business:</QUOTE> --

 <pb id="P.285" n="285"> 
   <P>Mr. Hood's <num value="1">first</num> work   was anonymous-his <QUOTE>Odes and Addresses to Great People</QUOTE> --a little, thin, mean-looking sort of a foolscap sub-octavo of poems, with nothing but wit and humour to recommend it. Coleridge was delighted with the work, and taxed Charles Lamb by letter with the authorship.   His next work was <QUOTE>A Plea for the Midsummer Fairies,</QUOTE> a serious poem   of infinite beauty, full of fine passages and of promise. The <QUOTE>Plea</QUOTE> was followed by <QUOTE>Whims and Oddities</QUOTE> the forerunner of the <hi rend=italics>Comic Annual</hi>. Then came the <QUOTE>Epping Hunt</QUOTE> and the <QUOTE>Dream of Eugene Aram;</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Tylney Hall,</QUOTE> a novel; and <QUOTE>Hood's Own; or, Laughter from Year to Year,</QUOTE> a volume of comic lucubrations, <QUOTE>with an infusion of New Blood for General Circulation.</QUOTE> His <QUOTE>Song of the Shirt</QUOTE> has been sung through the whole length and breadth of the <num value="3">three</num> kingdoms.   During the <num value="1">first</num> year of his residence at Camberwell, he was much amused at witnessing <QUOTE>all the fun of the fair,</QUOTE> which then annually ran riot at the latter end of August.   In a letter, written from <QUOTE><num value="2">2</num>, Union Row, High Street, Camberwell,</QUOTE> about this time, Hood says: <QUOTE>We have much more comfortable lodgings, and the &lsquo;busses pass the door constantly, being in the high road, <num value="50">fifty</num> or a <num value="100">hundred</num> yards townwards of the  <Q> Red Cap,</Q>  at the Green.   I have a room to myself, which will be worth <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> a year to me--for a little disconcerts my nerves.</QUOTE> In another letter from this place, dated <datestruct VALUE="1841-04-13"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=13>13th</day>, <year reg=1841>1841</year></datestruct>, Hood writes:-- <QUOTE>Camberwell is the best air I could have.</QUOTE> At the close of this year he removed to St. John's Wood, where he died about <num value="4">four</num> years later, at the early age of <num value="47">forty-seven</num>. 
    <P>The loyalty and military spirit of Camberwell, as a constituent portion of the county of Surrey, appear to have been maintained, without interruption, since the days of <QUOTE>good Queen   Bess,</QUOTE> Camberwell having then furnished a valiant quota to the forces collected to oppose the attempted  Spanish invasion; and having again, after the lapse of more than <num value="2">two</num> centuries--namely, in <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>-distinguished itself by forming a <QUOTE>Military  Association,</QUOTE> under the presidency and command of Claude Champion de Crespigny--the lineal representative of <num value="1">one</num> of the <QUOTE>old families</QUOTE> mentioned above; which Association, in <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct> when the country unanimously resented the menaces of  Buonaparte-developed itself into a formal volunteer corps. 
    <P>In   point of population, Camberwell offers, perhaps, the most striking example of increase which can be found throughout the metropolitan suburban area--the   number of its inhabitants having grown from <num value="7059">7,059</num>, in <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct>, to the astonishing amount of <num value="111306">111,306</num> in <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>. It seems, indeed, that, with the dawn of this century, Camberwell suddenly broke through the trammels which had been imposed upon suburban buildings during the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> and <num value="17">seventeenth</num> centuries, and had made their prescriptive influence felt throughout the eighteenth. Happy would it have been, both for the citizens and the city of London, had those laws been maintained and enforced in a salutary, judicious, and moderate manner.   Then, it has been remarked, we should not have seen, as we do now, so many square miles of fertile agricultural ground covered with useless bricks and mortar, the crowded habitations of a seething population; then, indeed, we should not have had miles of beggarly <num value="2">two</num>-storeyed tenements swallowing up all the open spaces about the metropolis, but should have adopted a system of building more consonant with the principles of sanitary laws, as well as with those of social and political economy. 
    <P>In few matters, during the <num value="1">first</num> half of the present century, has there been a greater change than in the mode and pace of travelling; and abundant illustration of this fact is shown by a retrospect of the character of the communication between  London and Camberwell as existing in the years  <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg=1796>1796</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg=1877>1877</year></datestruct>. In the former year, <num value="1">one</num> Camberwell coach was advertised to leave the <QUOTE>Anchor and Vine,</QUOTE> Charing Cross, twice daily, and another to leave the <QUOTE>Kings and Key,</QUOTE> Fleet Street, <num value="3">three</num> times daily. Now, besides omnibuses, whose name is legion, there are several railway-stations in Camberwell, and, likewise, a line of tramway from  Westminster to Camberwell Green and New Cross, besides other tramway lines from Camberwell to  Blackfriars and the City. By means of its railway and tramway communication, in addition to the ordinary omnibus service, Camberwell is now placed within easy reach of the central portion of the metropolis. 
    <P>In the Peckham Road, by which we now proceed, we pass, on our left, <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> asylums licensed for the reception of lunatics in Camberwell. This asylum, known as Camberwell House, with its surrounding pleasure and garden grounds, occupies a space of some <num value="20">twenty</num> acres, part of which is laid out in a park-like manner, the remainder being kept for the use of the patients who take an interest in garden pursuits.   The principal building, formerly known   as Alfred  House, was erected by Mr. Wanostrocht for a school, which he conducted for many years with eminent success. The house was afterwards used by the Royal Naval School, which, as we have already seen, was subsequently removed to New <pb id="P.286" n="286"> Cross.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="247">247</num>.</NOTE> The Royal Naval School was projected by Captain Dickson; was started by voluntary contributions, headed by the handsome donation of <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> from the late Dr. Bell; and had for its object the education of the sons of those naval and marine officers whose scanty incomes did not allow them to provide a <num value="1">first</num>-rate education for their boys. Its office was represented, from <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, by a <num value="2">second</num>-floor room in Jermyn Street, St. James's; and here its founders and projectors regularly met on board days, and worked for the advancement of the interests of the Royal Naval School. They were famous men who went up those stairs to the humble committee-room   in Jermyn Street-men whose names are household words amongst us now, and whom history will remember.   William IV., <QUOTE>the Sailor King,</QUOTE> was interested in this school, and met there Yorke, Blackwood, Keats, Hardy, Codrington, and Cockburn-brave admirals and famous <QUOTE>old salts,</QUOTE> some of whom could recollect, mayhap, what a struggle it was to live like a gentleman once, and bring up their boys as gentlemen's sons, on officer's pay. Alfred House was for a time the institution which uprose from the committee's <num value="1">first</num> deliberations, from voluntary contributions, and unaided by that Government grant which it deserved as an impetus in the <num value="1">first</num> instance, and which to this day, and for reasons inexplicable to all connected with the service and the school, it has been unable to obtain.

<P>Peckham, as a metropolitan suburb, has a history completely of its own, made up of King John, Nell Gwynne, the great Duke of Marlborough, Hannah Lightfoot, Dr. Collyer, and other celebrities; yet it is nevertheless curtly described by Priscilla Wakefield, in her <QUOTE>Perambulations of London,</QUOTE> as <QUOTE>a hamlet in the parish of Camberwell, on the road proceeding to Greenwich.</QUOTE> The only scrap of information which she adds is that <QUOTE>a large fair is held at Peckham annually, affording a holiday to a vast number of the lower classes of Londoners.</QUOTE> Of this fair we shall have more to say presently. The road above referred to leads from the Green at Camberwell, passes the parish church, and, continuing on through the village of Peckham, terminates in Queen's Road, which winds in a north-easterly direction, and ultimately unites with the Old Kent Road, near New Cross. Queen's Road, now a broad and well-built thoroughfare, was formerly known as Deptford Lane, and was re-named in honour of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, who often passed through it on her way to the Royal Naval School at New Cross. It is not so very long ago that Albert Road, a turning out of the Queen's Road, was known by the not very euphonious appellation of Cow   Walk. Within the present century Peckham rejoiced in a park of considerable extent, extending at <num value="1">one</num> time from the High Street as far northward as the Old Kent Road; but its existence is now merely kept in remembrance by Peckham   Park Road, which, with Hill Street, unites the <num value="2">two</num> thoroughfares, and has long been built upon. The Manor House of Peckham, which occupied a central position, was standing in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, when Priscilla Wakefield wrote her work above quoted. It is said to have been built by Sir Thomas Bond,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="272">272</num>.</NOTE> <num value="1">one</num> of the confidential friends of James II., and who loyally accompanied that monarch into exile. 
   <P>Sir Thomas Trevor, Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, created Lord Trevor by Queen Anne in <datestruct value="1711--"><year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct>, and <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="12">twelve</num> individuals who were made peers at once during the struggle for power, purchased the Peckham estate from Sir Henry Bond. The judge resided here occasionally, and after his decease, in <datestruct value="1731--"><year reg="1731">1731</year></datestruct>, the estate was purchased by a Mrs. Hill, from whom it descended to her nephew, Isaac P. Shard, Esq.; in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct> it <pb id="P.287" n="287"> belonged to his <num value="2">second</num> son, Mr. Charles Shard, of Lovel's Hill, near Windsor, who inherited the property from his elder brother. <QUOTE>In <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Blanch, in his History of Camberwell, <QUOTE>this ancient mansion was levelled to the ground for the then commencing great metropolitan improvements, and the present Hill Street forms the site of the once magnificent and stately mansion.</QUOTE> The Shards are kept in remembrance by Shard Square and the <QUOTE>Shard Arms.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Branching out of the Peckham Road, a number of new thoroughfares have sprung up within the last quarter of a century, the names of which impart quite a legal tone to the district, the roads being dedicated to Lords Lyndhurst, Denman, and  Selborne, and to Mr. Justice Talfourd.   A few steps out of the High Street is Peckham House, formerly an old private mansion, but for the last half century a lunatic asylum, kept by Dr. Stocker, whose predecessor was a Dr. Armstrong.   Its interior has been more than once graphically described by newspaper writers.   The fine old mansion and surrounding acres have not always been connected with the sad side of humanity, for prior to <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct> the noble building resounded with the merry laughter of freedom. The wealthy family of Spitta lived here in grand style, giving 
<hi rend=italics>feies</hi>, or what would   now   be termed   gardenparties, to their neighbours, and dispensing charity with no niggard hand amongst the poor of the locality. 
    <P>The High Street still boasts of many quaint houses, some of which can date back more than <num value="2">two</num> centuries. The police-station forms part of what was once a fine mansion, formerly occupied by a wealthy family of the name of Dalton, and subsequently used as a convent.   The policestation occupies the site of <num value="1">one</num> of its outbuildings.  Another house, now a draper's shop, was formerly the head-quarters of the Royal Asylum   of St.  Ann's Society, which was founded in <datestruct value="1702--"><year reg="1702">1702</year></datestruct>; whilst  Avenue House, now the central office of Miss  Rye's establishment for aiding the cause of female emigration, was, in days of old, a family mansion of some note. 
    <P>Near the High Street, on the ground now covered by Marlborough Road, formerly stood  Marlborough House, a fine old mansion, supposed at <num value="1">one</num> time to have been the residence of some members of the Churchill family. The building contained a noble entrance-hall and a fine oak staircase, and frescoes adorned   the walls and ceilings. For some years prior to its demolition, the building was used as a workhouse, where the city paupers were farmed.   Blenheim House, still standing in the High Street, is thought to have been a minor building attached to the mansion. 
   <P>The <QUOTE>Rosemary Branch</QUOTE> tavern, in Southanpton Street, which stands at the junction of the Commercial Road, although possessing but a local reputation at the present time, was a well-known metropolitan hostelry at the commencement of the century.   The old house, which was pulled down many years ago, was a picturesque structure, with rustic surroundings.   Its original sign, if we may trust an entry in the churchwardens' accounts for <datestruct value="1707--"><year reg="1707">1707</year></datestruct>, appears to have been the <QUOTE>Rosemary Bush ;</QUOTE> at all events, the entry referred to runs thus: <QUOTE>Received of Mr. Travers, for a stranger dying at ye Rosemary Bush, <num value="00">00</num>. <num value="00">00</num>. <measure value="04d." type=currency><num value="04">04</num>d.</measure></QUOTE> Tradition has it, that whenever the landlord of the old house tapped a barrel of beer, the inhabitants for some distance round were apprised of the fact by bell and proclamation!

   <P>A local tradition says that King John, hunting at Peckham, killed a stag, and was so pleased with the sport, that he granted its inhabitants an annual fair of <num value="3">three</num> weeks' continuance; but no charter to that effect has been found.

 ments. Dramatic performances occasionally took place here as late as the beginning of this century. In <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>, however, the Lancasterian school for boys took possession of the premises. 
   <P>In the High Street, at the corner of Clayton Road, there formerly stood a very quaint old house, with a thatched roof; it had once been a farmhouse. It was pulled down in <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>The house at Peckham, where Goldsmith was employed as tutor in a school under a Dr. Milner, and where he wrote the best part of his <QUOTE>Vicar of  Wakefield,</QUOTE> was pulled down in <datestruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct>.   In the  Life of Goldsmith prefixed to his <QUOTE>Works</QUOTE> we read: <QUOTE>Tired of practice, or disappointed of success, he soon exchanged the phial for the ferule, and prescriptions for spelling-books. Goldsmith came out in the character of a schoolmaster's assistant at Peckham, a kind of employment to which he had been used before; and at the table of Dr. Milner--for so the master of the school was named-he became acquainted with Smollett, who <num value="1">first</num> directed him to literature as a means of subsistence, by employing him   as a contributor to the <hi rend=italics>Monthly Review</hi>. Subsequently, physic and literature were combined to eke out a maintenance, <pb id="P.290" n="290"> and, in the double capacity of doctor and author, he presents himself to our notice in a wretched lodging by Salisbury Square, Fleet Street. Here we have a peep into the life of a poor literary man of the eighteenth century, to which parallels are numerous enough in the <num value="19">nineteenth</num>. Leaving his lodgings, he kept his appointments at some house of call; the Temple Exchange Coffee-house, Temple Bar, was his most favoured resort. There, indeed, was his ostensible abode; and the people who saw him by day had little idea of the forlorn lodging where he spent his nights.</QUOTE> The school was afterwards called in his honour Goldsmith's House. An avenue of trees in the grounds was once known as <QUOTE>Goldsmith's Walk,</QUOTE> but it has long since passed away. 
    <P>Hanover Street, in Rye Lane (formerly South  Street), was doubtless intended as a compliment to the House of Hanover, some members of that family having been great patrons of <LEMMA id="lemma.290.1">Dr. Collyer</LEMMA>, whose chapel, at the entrance to Rye Lane, is also known as Hanover Chapel. Basing Yard, in the rear of Hanover Street, serves as a memorial of Basing Manor, a well-known residence here during the time of the <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="2">second</num> Charles.  Among the former residents of Peckham, there was  Sir T. Gardyner, of Basing Manor, who, when writing to Lord Dorchester, in <datestruct value="1630--"><year reg="1630">1630</year></datestruct>, concerning the Papal machinations in Spain, eccentrically remarks that he would write a book on the subject if his time <QUOTE>were not so much occupied with grooving melons and other fruits.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In Rye Lane is a large and well-built station, on the South London and the London, Chatham, and Dover Railways.   Close by the station, a large building was erected in <datestruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct>, as a Museum   of Fire-Arms, and for the exhibition of everything connected with gunnery.   After standing a few years, it was burnt down, but was subsequently rebuilt. A rifle-range was also connected with the building, which, in process of time, was made to serve the purposes of a pleasure resort; but this in the end was converted into a manufactory of fire-arms. 
   <P>Peckham Rye--a tract of common said to be upwards of <num value="50">fifty</num> acres in extent--has from <QUOTE>time immemorial</QUOTE> been used as a recreation-ground by the inhabitants, not only of this district, but by thousands upon thousands whose life is principally spent amidst City smoke or over-built suburbs. Peckham Rye formed part of <num value="2">two</num> manors, known as Camberwell Buckingham and Camberwell Friern; but in the year <datestruct value="1868"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct> the manorial rights were purchased by the vestry of the parish. Previous to this acquisition of <QUOTE>the Rye</QUOTE> --as the common is popularly called-by the vestry, the lord of the manor, Sir William Bowyer Smyth, had granted to a few of the inhabitants in its vicinity leases for <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years, all of which expired in <datestruct VALUE="1866-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>.   The lessees usually expended about &pound;ioo per annum   (partly contributed by the inhabitants of the neighbourhood) in keeping the common in good condition. 
    <P>The lord of the manor formerly held considerable property in the vicinity of Peckham Rye; indeed, as Mr. Blanch tells us, at <num value="1">one</num> time the Bowyer family were the principal landowners in this parish. As far back as <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct>, and again in <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>, protests were made by the parishioners against encroachments on the Rye, facts which are duly recorded in the Vestry Minutes.   In <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>, a meeting of the inhabitants was held, to consider the best means to be adopted to prevent the erection of buildings on the Rye; and the matter was taken up by Parliament. In his evidence before the Committee of the House of Commons, in <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>, the deputysteward of the lord of the manor claimed for Sir Bowyer Smyth the absolute ownership of the Rye, and asserted that he was entitled   to the   full building value of the land, there being at that time, in his opinion, no copy-holder having rights over it.   In the end, however, as we have stated above, the manorial rights, whatever they may have been, were purchased by the vestry; and thus the Rye has become the common property of the parish, and made available for the free use of the South Londoner.<NOTE>This case is as nearly as possible identical with that of Hampstead Heath. See Vol. V., p <num value="45">45</num> .</NOTE>

   <P>In former times, the people's claims to the commons were   stoutly defended-even   to   the sacrifice of life--not so much for the right of recreation as for the right of grazing or. of gathering fuel. An old ditty, embodying the feeling of the people, runs thus : 
        <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>&lsquo;Tis very bad, in man or woman, 
          <L>To steal a goose from off the common; 
          <L>But who shall plead that man's excuse 
          <L>Who steals the common from the goose?</QUOTE>

   <P>In   some old documents the Rye is spelled <QUOTE>Rey ;</QUOTE> and the old word <QUOTE>ree,</QUOTE> a water-course, river, or expanse of water, is considered as probably the origin of the term. On the Rye is a quaint old farm-house, known as Homestead Farm, which takes us back to the time when such holdings abounded throughout the district. 
   <P>On the north-east side of Peckham Rye is Nunhead, which is rapidly becoming a place of some importance, with a large population, and the <pb id="P.291" n="291"> headquarters of various centres of industry. Nunhead Green, an open space about <num value="1">one</num> acre in extentstill remains; but its surroundings are now very different to what they were half a century ago, when village lads and lasses were wont to dance and romp there, and when the ancient <QUOTE>Nun's Head,</QUOTE> which has been an institution in the locality for above <num value="200">two hundred</num> years, was an object of attraction, through its tea-gardens, to worn-out citizens. 
    <P>Here is the Asylum of the Metropolitan Beer and Wine Trade Association, which dates from <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>, when, at a general meeting of the beer-trade as a protection society, the idea assumed a substantial form, and a subscription was opened. The beer-sellers actively bestirred themselves to imitate the good example set by the licensed victuallers, by seeking to provide an asylum for their aged and decayed members.   Indeed, <num value="1">one</num> of the original objects contemplated by the promoters of the society was, <QUOTE>To raise a fund from which to allow temporary or permanent assistance to members of the trade.</QUOTE> It was considered that the most useful permanent assistance that could be rendered would be by the erection of almshouses.   The present plot of freehold ground, situate at Nunhead Green, was consequently purchased with the funds in hand for <measure value="550l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="550">550</num></measure>.   An appeal was then made to the trade for further funds to erect the building, the result of which enabled the committee to commence the work. The <num value="1">first</num> stone was laid by Lord Monteagle (the patron of the society) in <datestruct VALUE="1852-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, and the building was completed and opened for the reception of inmates in <datestruct VALUE="1853-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1853">1853</year></datestruct>, the total cost being about <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure>.   It comprises <num value="7">seven</num> houses, each containing <num value="4">four</num> rooms and a kitchen, accommodating in all <num value="13">thirteen</num> inmates, and a piece of garden-ground in the rear for the use of the inmates is attached to each holding.   In <datestruct value="1872--"><year reg="1872">1872</year></datestruct> a new wing was completed, by the erection of <num value="8">eight</num> <num value="6">six</num>-roomed houses, thus providing accommodation for <num value="16">sixteen</num> more inmates.   There is an allowance of <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>s.</measure> per week to single inmates, and <measure value="9s." type=currency><num value="9">9</num>s.</measure> per week to married couples. 
   <P>Nunhead Cemetery, covering an area of about <num value="50">fifty</num> acres, occupies the summit of some rising ground, whence a good view is obtained of the surrounding neighbourhood.   The cemetery was consecrated by the Bishop of Winchester in <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, and is beautifully laid out with gravel walks, and thickly planted with trees, shrubs, and flowers. The chapels in the grounds are conspicuous objects for miles round. 
   <P>Nunhead Hill is mentioned by Hone in his <QUOTE>Every-day Book</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>), as being <QUOTE>the favourite resort of smoke-dried London artisans.</QUOTE> A narrow path by the side of the cemetery is all that remains for their Sunday promenade. 
    <P>On the north side of Nunhead Cemetery are the reservoirs of the <LEMMA id="lemma.291.1">Southwark and Vauxhall Water  Company</LEMMA>, covering several acres of land.   The works include <num value="4">four</num> reservoirs-<num value="2">two</num> high-level and <num value="2">two</num> low-level; the former holding <num value="6000000">6,000,000</num> gallons, and the latter double that number.   The water is drawn from the Thames, about <num value="6">six</num> miles above Teddington Locks. The water having been pumped up by an engine at Hampton Court, is forced on to Battersea, whence powerful engines again send it on to the reservoirs at Nunhead.  The engine-house here, which stands between the upper and lower reservoirs, is a handsome brick structure, with a square tower <num value="70">seventy</num> feet high, and built in the Venetian style of architecture. 
    <P>Within the grounds now occupied by St. Mary's  College, stood a building of some note in the early part of the present century, and known as <QUOTE>Heaton's Folly.</QUOTE> This building was capped with a tower, giving it the appearance of a religious edifice. Lysons gives the following account of the structure :-- <QUOTE>On the right side of the path leading from Peckham to Nunhead, appears this building, environed with wood. It has a singular appearance, and certainly was the effect of a whim. Various tales are related of its founder; but the most feasible appears his desire of giving employment to a number of artificers during a severe dearth. It is related that he employed <num value="500">five hundred</num> persons in this building, and adding to the grounds; which is by no means improbable, as, on entering the premises, a very extensive piece of water appears, embanked by the properties taken from its bosom.  In the centre of it is an island, well cultivated; indeed, the whole ground is now   (<datestruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>) so luxuriantly spread, that I much doubt if such another spot, within a considerable distance from the metropolis, can boast such a variety and significance. The whole is within a fence; and, time having assisted the maturity of the coppice, you are, to appearance, enjoying the effects of a small lake in the centre of a wood. Motives the most laudable, as before observed, induced the founder of this sequestered spot to give bread to many half-starved and wretched families; and, to use the phrase of our immortal Shakespeare,  <Q>It is like the dew from heaven, and doubly blesses.</Q>   If from appearance we are to judge of the phrase, it thrives indeed; and what was meant as assistance to a neighbouring poor, and stragglers, wretched and forlorn, is now, with all propriety, the Paradise of Peckham.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In the neighbourhood of Peckham Rye, on the <pb id="P.292" n="292"> road to Forest Hill and Sydenham, is a hill with an oak upon its summit, called the <QUOTE>Oak of Honour :</QUOTE> at present shortened into <QUOTE>Honour Oak.</QUOTE> It is said to have been so called because Queen Elizabeth, in <num value="1">one</num> of her excursions on horseback from Greenwich, dined beneath its shade.

   <P>Friern Place, on the south-west side of Peckham Rye, keeps in remembrance the name of Friern Manor, the farm of which was known in recent times as a dairy-farm on a large scale. The Manor Farm-house and all its sheds and out-buildings were sold at the end of <datestruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct>. The house, which was not the original manor-house, was built by Lord St. John, in <datestruct value="1725--"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>; and there is a tradition that Alexander Pope resided there for a season, writing a portion of the <QUOTE>Essay on Man</QUOTE> beneath its roof, but it is merely a tradition. Lordship Lane, which lies on the west side of Friern Manor-uniting Goose Green and East Dulwich with Court Lane and the village of Dulwich-is supposed to have taken its name from the lordship of Friern Manor. 
   <P>In Lordship Lane, there was, in the time of William Hone, an inn called the <QUOTE>Plough</QUOTE> --an old-fashioned wooden structure--on <num value="1">one</num> of the windows of which was the following inscription, cut with a diamond :-- <QUOTE><datestruct VALUE="1810-03-16"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=16>16</day>, <year reg=1810>1810</year></datestruct>.

    <P>A writer in Hone's <QUOTE>Every-day Book</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>) thus describes the scenery in this neighbourhood:-- <QUOTE>Below me, yet wearing its sober livery of brown, lies the wood. the shadowy haunt of the gipsy tribe ere magisterial authority drove them away.  Many a pleasant hour have I spent in my younger days with its Cassandras, listening to their prophetic voices and looking at their dark eyes. I proceed:  Sydenham lies before me; beyond it, in softened distance, Beckenham   and Bromley meet the eye, with Dulwich below; and in the foreground lies a rich variety of upland and dale, studded with snowwhite dwellings.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Dulwich, which we now enter, is described in Hone's <QUOTE>Table-Book,</QUOTE> with some little exaggeration, as <QUOTE>the prettiest of all the village entrances in the environs of London;</QUOTE> and Priscilla Wakefield, in her <QUOTE>Perambulations</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>), says it is <QUOTE>a hamlet to Camberwell, and is pleasantly retired, having no high road passing through it.   It was formerly,</QUOTE> she adds, <QUOTE>the resort of much company, on account of a medicinal spring, which has now lost its reputation. The house which has the sign of the  <Q>Green Man</Q>  was for some time the residence of Lord Thurlow.   A fine avenue through the wood faces this house, and leads to a charming prospect.   The manor of Dulwich belongs to the college founded there, in <datestruct value="1614--"><year reg="1614">1614</year></datestruct>, by Master Edward 
<LEMMA id="lemma.292.3">Alleyn</LEMMA>, the proprietor of the Fortune playhouse, in Whitecross Street, and also a favourite actor. The foundation was for a master and warden of the lineage and surname of Alleyn (but the impossibility of finding them has obliged the name of Allen to be of late years accepted), also <num value="4">four</num> fellows, <num value="6">six</num> poor brethren, and <num value="6">six</num> poor sisters; <num value="12">twelve</num> scholars, <num value="6">six</num> assistants, and <num value="30">thirty</num> outmembers or pensioners.   It was originally built after a design by Inigo Jones, and formed <num value="3">three</num> sides of a square. The picture-gallery, which is on the <num value="1">first</num> floor, contains some scarce and valuable paintings. The chapel is a plain building, which serves as a chapel of ease to the inhabitants of the hamlet. The founder, his wife, and her mother, are buried in it; and a clause in the statutes permits that privilege to the master, warden, and fellows, but excludes all others.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Notwithstanding the active building operations that of late years have fenced in London and its suburbs with miles of bricks and mortar, the village of Dulwich still presents a rural aspect, and large tracts of meadow-land are yet to be found within its borders. From the high grounds of Champion Hill, Denmark Hill, and Herne Hill, of which we <pb id="P.293" n="293"> have spoken in the preceding chapter, through the whole length of the intervening valley, and up the opposite slopes to the summit of Sydenham and Forest Hills, may still be heard the song of birds; whilst the beauties of the place are spread out in groves and pleasure-grounds, green lanes, and flowery meadows.   The southern portion of the hamlet was formerly an immense wood, intersected with devious paths. It was the sacred home of the gipsy tribe, and the rendezvous of summer parties. At the beginning of the present century, before what may be termed modern Dulwich sprang into existence, Byron, then a schoolboy here, made Dulwich Wood <num value="1">one</num> of his favourite haunts, and, we are told, would there <QUOTE>daily hold converse with motley groups of the vagabond class.</QUOTE> But little is left of the wood beyond a memory, which local nomenclature has done something to preserve, in the names of Dulwich Wood Park, Kingswood Road, and Crescent Wood Road. We are told how that, in the days of Charles I., the Court paid frequent visits to Dulwich and its woods for the purposes of sport; and how authority was given by warrant to <num value="1">one</num> Anthony Holland, <num value="1">one</num> of the yeomen-huntsmen in ordinary to his Majesty, to make known his Majesty's commands to the inhabitants of Dulwich <QUOTE>that they forbeare to hunt, chace, molest, or hurt the king's stagges with greyhounds, hounds, gunnes, or any other means whatsoever;</QUOTE> and also how the said Anthony Holland was further authorised <QUOTE>to take from any person or persons offending therein their dogges, hounds, gunnes, crossbowes, or other engynes.</QUOTE> 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.293.1">Dulwich Park</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>Dulwich Wood has been the scene of several outrages, notably those which occurred in <datestruct value="1738--"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>, when a man named Samuel Bentyman was murdered, and in <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, when Samuel Matthews, known as the Dulwich Hermit, met with a similar fate. Mr. Blanch informs us that the wood has been gradually disappearing from the time when Edward Alleyn issued his statutes and ordinances for the foundation of the college in the early part of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, for by the <num value="106">106</num>th item it is ordered <QUOTE>that twentye acres of woode be felled and sold yearly, such wood-falls to be made at seasonable times, and in accordance with the laws and statutes of England, for the preservation of timber-trees, such trees to be of the growth of <num value="10">ten</num> yeares;</QUOTE> and by the <num value="110">110</num>th item it is enacted <QUOTE>that no timber-trees shall be sold to any pson. or psons. whatsoever, but to the tenants of the lands belonging to the said college in Dulwich, for the building or repayring of their tenements.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The same writer justly remarks, in his <title>History of Camberwell</title>, that <QUOTE>the Dulwich College Building Act of <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>, the Metropolis Local Management Act of <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>, the Charity Commissioners' scheme of <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>, the formation of the iron roads, and the craving of merchants for suburban residences, have done much to alter the aspect of the place ;</QUOTE> but that, <QUOTE>compared with neighbouring suburbs, it has died hard, and not until Cowper's  <Q>opulent, enlarged, and still-increasing London,</Q>  by sheer force of circumstances, has laid its hands upon it, will Dulwich surrender its individuality.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The village <QUOTE>stocks</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>cage,</QUOTE> with the motto, <QUOTE>It is a sport for a fool to do mischief; thine own wickedness shall correct thee,</QUOTE> formerly stood at the corner of the pathway across the fields leading to Camberwell, opposite the burial-ground; and the college <QUOTE>pound,</QUOTE> which formerly stood near the toll-gate in the Penge Road, was, in <datestruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></datestruct>, ordered to be removed to the end of Croxted Lane. <num value="1">One</num> of the most interesting spots within the hamlet is that formerly known as Bew's Corner, Lordship Lane. The <QUOTE>Green Man,</QUOTE> a tavern of some note in the middle of the last century, formerly occupied the site, after which time Dr. Glennie's school was built; and that in its turn having disappeared, a beer-house was opened there, by a man named Bew, formerly employed at the college, who made use of some out-buildings of the once famous school, and converted the grounds into a teagarden. 
   <P>The famous Dulwich Wells were in close proximity to the <QUOTE>Green Man,</QUOTE> and the Dulwich waters were cried about the streets of London as far back as <datestruct value="1678--"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct>; and for many years, through the high repute of the waters, much custom was drawn to the adjoining tavern, which, in <datestruct value="1748--"><year reg="1748">1748</year></datestruct>, was described as a <QUOTE>noted house of good entertainment.</QUOTE> The proprietor flourished so well, that a publication of the time tells us that <QUOTE>he has lately built a handsome room on <num value="1">one</num> end of his bowling-green for breakfasts, dancing, and entertainment; a part of the fashionable luxury of the present age, which every village for <num value="10">ten</num> miles round London has something of.</QUOTE> A full account of the Dulwich mineral waters was communicated to the public through the <QUOTE>Philosophical Transactions,</QUOTE> by Professor Martyn, F.R.S. Mr. Bray, in his account of this parish in his <QUOTE>History of Surrey,</QUOTE> writes :-- <QUOTE>In the autumn of <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>, Mr. Cox, master of the</QUOTE> Green Man, <QUOTE>about a mile south of the village of Dulwich, having occasion to sink a well for his family, dug down about <num value="60">sixty</num> feet without finding water. Discouraged at this, he covered it up, and so left it. In the following spring, however, he opened it again; when, the Botanical Professor in the University of Cambridge being present, it was <pb id="P.294" n="294"> found to contain about <num value="25">twenty-five</num> feet of water, of a sulphureous taste and smell.</QUOTE> It was found by experiment to be possessed of purgative qualities, and was for some time used medicinally, but was afterwards neglected. 
   <P>Dr. Webster, who has been considered a high authority on the subject, writes as follows with reference to these waters :-- <QUOTE>The saline spring was, and is, situated on Sydenham Common, in Wells Lane, on the slope of the hill between Dulwich and Sydenham.   The little old cottage and garden where the <Q>Sydenham Wells</Q> are, belongs to <num value="2">two</num> elderly women of the name ot Evans, and on my expressing surprise that they had not been  <Q>bought out</Q>  for building, as the spot is surrounded by modern mansions and good houses, they replied, they kept possession, as the little property would be beneficial to their deceased brother's children. It is not at all resorted to now for medicinal purposes; but the water is strongly saline, similar to that at the quondam  <Q> Beulah Spa,</Q>  at Streatham Common, and at E<num value="1">1</num>psom.   It is situated in the parish of Lewisham, Kent.   The Dulwich Spa was a chalybeate spring, situated about a mile S.E. of Dulwich College, close to, or rather, I believe, <hi rend=italics>in</hi>
the premises of the  <Q> Green Man,</Q>  then a place of resort on the verge of Dulwich Common.   This was as far back as the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century; but this house of entertainment was, when I <num value="1">first</num> knew it (<datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>), a house of instruction, as Dr. Glennie's well-known academy, at which Lord Byron was a

 pupil for <num value="2">two</num> years. The old house was taken down about <num value="10">ten</num> years after, when Dr. Glennie had left, but I remember then seeing a well within the premises, which had been long shut up or disused, and I tasted the water, which was decidedly chalybeate.   On the site of the old  <Q>Green Man</Q>  now stands the  <Q>Grove Tavern,</Q>  of no celebrity in any way unless from the circumstances now stated, and which very few knew besides myself. I knew the supposed localities of both these places many years ago, but it is only recently that Evelyn's 
<title>Diary</title> fell in my way, and it is remarkable that he incidentally mentions them   so as to identify the <hi rend=italics><num value="2">two</num></hi> springs.   Under date <datestruct VALUE="1675-09-2"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=2>2nd</day>, <year reg=1675>1675</year></datestruct>, he notes:  <Q> I went to see Dulwich Colledge, being the pious foundation of <num value="1">one</num> Alien, a famous comedian in King James's time.   The chapell is pretty; the rest of the hospital very ill contriv'd; it yet maintaines divers poore of both sexes. &lsquo;Tis in a melancholy part of Camerwell parish.   I came back by certaine medicinal Spa waters at a place called Sydnam Wells, in Lewisham   parish, much frequented in summer.</Q>  And further on :  <Q><datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>, <datestruct VALUE="-08-5"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=5>5th</day></datestruct>, I went to visit my Iord Brounker, now taking the waters at Dulwich.</Q>  So you see,</QUOTE> adds Dr. Webster, <QUOTE>there were <num value="2">two</num> distinct spas within a mile, but in different parishes and counties, as Dulwich is in Surrey.</QUOTE> So, as our readers will observe, fashionable persons resorted to Dulwich for the purpose of <QUOTE>taking the waters,</QUOTE> just as they did at Hampstead a century later. <pb id="P.295" n="295">

   <P>Among the pupils at Dr. Glennie's academy in Dulwich Grove, were several who in after years rose to fame and fortune-Lord Byron, General Le Marchant, Sir Donald M&lsquo;Leod, Captain Barclay, the celebrated pedestrian, and others.  <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Once a week did the little party meet together in the spacious entrance-hall for a little rational amusement, and   the Saturday evening   concerts at Dulwich attracted visitors from outside the family circle.    <Q>Tom</Q>  Campbell the poet, Howard and Wilkie, artists and academicians, and Barker the well-known painter of panoramas, and many others, often found themselves at Dulwich.   Campbell had not far to come, for he resided at Sydenham for <num value="17">seventeen</num> years before that retired little village became an  <Q>endless pile of brick.</Q>    Here the happiest of the poet's days were spent in genial and   congenial society, and   much   concerning 
<Q>evenings</Q> there may be found in the memoirs of Moore, Hook, Hunt, the brothers Smith, and others. 
   <P>The narrow lane, lined with hedgerows, and passing through a little dell watered by a rivuletthe extensive prospect of undulating hills, parklike enclosures, the shady walks,</QUOTE> where the poet was <QUOTE>safe from all intrusion but that of the Muses,</QUOTE> as he himself describes them--

   <P>With respect to Byron's school-days at Dulwich, there is nothing remarkable for us to record. In a letter to Tom   Moore, Dr. Glennie speaks of Byron's ambition to excel in all athletic exercises, notwithstanding his lameness; <QUOTE>an ambition,</QUOTE> writes Dr. Glennie, <QUOTE>which I have found to prevail in general in young persons labouring under similar defects of nature.</QUOTE> It is said that Byron and   his schoolfellows kept up a mimicry   of brigandage, and that the stern demand of <QUOTE>Stand and deliver</QUOTE> was often made, to the amusement of the boys, and the fright of the passing stranger. <QUOTE>It must not be imagined,</QUOTE> adds Mr. Blanch, in writing of this epoch, <QUOTE>that brigandage in Dulwich was all play, for at the commencement of the present century Sydenham   Hill had then a reputation somewhat akin to Hounslow Heath. Dulwich Wood was the halting-place for gipsies; and highwaymen and footpads abounded in the locality.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Dulwich has long been a favourite resort for the working men of London, for the purpose of holding their annual gatherings at <num value="1">one</num> or other of its taverns, the chief of which are the <QUOTE>Greyhound,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Half Moon,</QUOTE> and   the <QUOTE>Crown.</QUOTE> The <QUOTE>Crown</QUOTE> has been an <QUOTE>institution</QUOTE> in Dulwich for upwards of a century and a half; the greater part of the present house was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, and it was further modernised about <num value="20">twenty</num> years later. In the garden of the <QUOTE>Half Moon,</QUOTE> at the northern extremity of the village, for many years was to be seen the old tombstone of Edward Alleyn, the founder of Dulwich   College, and it doubtless proved advantageous to the landlord in drawing visitors to his house.   It has, however, been superseded by a new tombstone in the college chapel.      The <QUOTE>Greyhound</QUOTE> is a well-known hostelry here, and has been held by the same family for upwards of a century. Here the Dulwich Club holds its meetings.   This association was established in. <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, for the purposes of friendly converse and social cheer among a large body of literary gentlemen; and the club has entertained at its table during its career many distinguished men, such as Dr. Glennie, Thomas Campbell, Dr. Babington, Dickens, Thackeray, Mark Lemon, and others. 
   <P>Among the residents at Dulwich in recent times have been several whose names have become famous.   Of these we may mention Mr. Howard Staunton, who lived at Ivy Cottage, while engaged in his Shakespearean researches at the college. Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Hall, the well-known authors, at <num value="1">one</num> time lived here. Another noted name in connection with Dulwich is that of Henry Bessemer, the inventor of a new process in the manufacture of steel, and whose numerous patents connected with improvements in machinery have been such as to have established his reputation as a scientific and practical engineer of the highest order. 
   <P>Numerous mansions and seats are scattered about in the neighbourhood of Dulwich, notably Casino, on Dulwich Hill; Mr, Bessemer's house on Denmark Hill; Woodhall, formerly the residence of the late Mr. George Grote, the historian of Greece; the Hoo, on Sydenham   Hill; and lastly, the Manor House.   This last-mentioned edifice is a building of more than ordinary interest, from the fact that it was once the residence of Edward Alleyn, the Lord Mayor of London, and perhaps, at an earlier period, the summer retreat of the Abbots of Bermondsey.   It was formerly called Hall Court. <QUOTE>The house, since Alleyn's time,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Blanch, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>has undergone sundry additions and alterations, and at the present time is in a marvellous condition for so old a building --a fact which seems to confirm the belief that it was built before Alleyn's time, as the erection of <pb id="P.297" n="297"> the old college, which was closely watched by the founder, began to tumble to pieces soon after his death.   The Manor House had been designed and built in a very different style.   The magnificent oak staircase, and spacious entrance-hall, and lofty rooms, are worthy of the majestic actor; and, as <num value="1">one</num> looks around, the form of its dignified host is conjured up; now receiving the poor brethren and sisters, holding consultations with the master, warden, and fellows, and anon holding converse and correspondence with the great men of the land, Alleyn's life at Dulwich must have been delightful.   Possessing ample means--much given to home comforts and duties, to which he was so attached that within <num value="3">three</num> months of losing  <Q>his good sweete harte and loving mouse,</Q>  he took unto himself another partner--regarded   by his neighbours as a man of considerable substance, and treated in a manner befitting the squire of the place-having great worldly knowledge, serene temper, and considerable tact-he made many friends and few enemies; and as his journal teems with payments for sundry bottles of wine when he went to London to see his friends, it is fair to assume that his cellar at the Manor House was well filled, and at the service of his visitors. 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.297.1">Old Matthews, the Dulwich Hermit</LEMMA></NOTE>

    <P>And what more delightful walks could any mortal have had than those surrounding the fine old mansion in Alleyn's time?-when the meadows were yellow with the crowfoot, flushed with the sorrel, or purple with clover; the thornbushes, white or pink with their blossoms; the commons, golden with mellowing fern or glowing with purple heather; and deciduous trees contributing their varied tints to the scene-all this was then a reality! Would that it were so now-and to the same extent!-and the shade of wood and grove, and the ramble 
  <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>O&lsquo;er many a heath, through many a woodland dun, 
     <L>Through buried paths, where sleepy twilight dreams 
     <L>The summer-time away;</QUOTE>
 and the feast of satisfaction as the founder viewed the progress of his college, at the end of a summer's stroll-all this must have made life more than endurable at the Manor House. 
   <P>That Alleyn received at his board many distinguished men of his day is beyond doubt; but, strange to relate, no scrap of evidence has yet been produced in support of the supposition that Shakespeare ever made pilgrimage to Dulwich.   It is, to say the least of it, an extraordinary circumstance, that <num value="2">two</num> such prominent characters in the same profession should not have been brought together--or rather, that no evidence should be forthcoming in support of such a natural supposition. Garrick, Malone, Collier, Ingleby, Staunton, and other able and industrious workers have toiled diligently, and hoped unfalteringly, but without success.     And   yet Ben   Jonson   and   Michael Drayton were intimate associates both of Shakespeare   and Alleyn.   They were not divided by disparity of age, for Alleyn was Shakespeare's junior by only <num value="2">two</num> years, <num value="4">four</num> months, and a week, and both relinquished   the stage, and   invested their earnings in houses and lands, at about the same time.</QUOTE>

    <P>From   the old   Manor House, the   home of  Edward Alleyn, it is but an easy transition to pass to the <LEMMA id="lemma.297.2">College</LEMMA>, of which he was the founderor, to give it its full title, to <QUOTE>Alleyn's College of   God's   Gift.</QUOTE> Born   in   the   parish   of St.  Botolph, Bishopsgate, in <datestruct VALUE="1566-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1566">1566</year></datestruct>, Alleyn lived to attain extraordinary celebrity as an actor in an age prolific beyond all others in dramatic talent.   Fuller, in his <QUOTE>Worthies,</QUOTE> describes him as <QUOTE>the Roscius of our age, so acting to the life that he made any part (especially a majestick <num value="1">one</num>) to become him.</QUOTE> The following epigram, addressed by Ben Jonson to Edward Allen, will serve to show the reputation in which the latter was held among the poets and men of letters of his time:-- 
      <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>If Rome, so great, and in her wisest age, 
        <L>Feared not to boast the glories of her stage,

        <L>So many poets life, by <num value="1">one</num> should live.</QUOTE>
 
    <P> <QUOTE>The connection of the name of Alien (usually spelt Alleyn, but now   printed Alien) with the munificent endowment of Dulwich College,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Robert Bell, <QUOTE>has eclipsed his reputation as an actor; but, independently of this high encomium of Jonson, ample evidence has been traced, not only of the influential position he held in relation to the stage, but of his great skill as a player. He appears to have been the chief manager of the business of the company for Henslowe, with whom he was part-proprietor of the Fortune, and to whose   stepdaughter he was   married.      He negotiated with authors, and made engagements with actors, for which he was better qualified, in some respects, than Henslowe, who, although an <pb id="P.298" n="298"> excellent man of business, was illiterate.   There is reason to believe, also, from certain entries in   Henslowe's diary, that he sometimes helped to reconstruct, or adapt, pieces for the stage. As an actor he certainly stood in the <num value="1">first</num> rank, and his special merits in particular parts are testified by   Nash, Dekker, and Heywood.   All the particulars of his life that are now likely to be recovered have been collected by Mr. Collier, in the  <Q> Memoir</Q>  of him, and in the  <Q>Alleyn Papers,</Q>  published by the Shakespeare Society.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1606--"><year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct> Alleyn had already commenced the acquisition of property at Dulwich.   The most important of the valuable   estates which   now collectively form the endowment of the college were   the lands and   lordship   of the manor, purchased in the above-mentioned year from Sir  Francis Calton, to whose ancestor, Thomas Calton, they had been granted by Henry VIII. upon the dissolution of the Monastery of Bermondsey.   The college land stretches southwards from   the high ground, known in its several parts as Champion  Hill, Denmark Hill, and Herne Hill, through the whole length of the intervening valley, and up the opposite slopes to the summit of Sydenham and  Forest Hills, a length of more than <num value="3">three</num> miles as the crow flies.   The breadth of the estate from east to west is quite a mile and a half in its widest part.   The village of Dulwich occupies a central position on the college lands.   It lies, as we have stated above, in the bottom of the valley between the ridge on which rests the Crystal Palace and the less lofty ridge midway between Sydenham  Hill and the Thames.   It is so shut in by near hills, or by lofty trees, in all directions, that its horizon is nowhere more distant than a mile or <num value="2">two</num>.   Visitors constantly remark that when in  Dulwich they are as much in the country as if they were <num value="50">fifty</num> miles from London; and yet the village milestone in front of the college, bearing the hospital invitation to wayfarers, <QUOTE lang=la>Sisle, Viator,</QUOTE>
records the distance of that spot from the Treasury,  Whitehall, or from the Standard at Cornhill, to be only <num value="5">five</num> miles. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct> Alleyn contracted with a certain John Benson, of Westminster, for the erection of <QUOTE>a Chappell, a Schoole-house, and   <num value="12">twelve</num> Almeshouses,</QUOTE> and in the course of the years <datestruct value="1616--"><year reg=1616>1616</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1617--"><year reg=1617>1617</year></datestruct> the <num value="1">first</num> members of his foundation were admitted into the college.   But Alleyn's great work was still far from   completed.   For some years he was engaged in harassing and apparently futile negotiations to obtain a royal patent for the permanent establishment of his foundation. It is interesting to observe that the impediments which Alleyn experienced seem to have proceeded chiefly from no less eminent a man than the great Lord Bacon, then Lord Chancellor.   In a letter to the Marquis of Buckingham, dated <datestruct VALUE="1618-08-18"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=18>18th</day>,   <year reg=1618>1618</year></datestruct>, Bacon, while he says, with characteristic point and quaintness, <QUOTE>I like well that Allen playeth the last act of his life so well,</QUOTE> yet pleads with the king, through Buckingham, for the curtail ment of Alleyn's eleemosynary foundation, and the promotion in preference of endowments for the encouragement of learning. In spite, however, of all difficulties, Alleyn's unflinching perseverance at last prevailed, and on the <datestruct VALUE="1619-06-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1619">1619</year></datestruct>, the great seal of England was affixed to letters patent from James I., giving licence to Edward   Alleyn <QUOTE>to found and   establish   a college in   Dulwich, to endure and remain for ever, and to be called  <Q>The College of God's Gift in Dulwich, in the county of Surrey.</Q> </QUOTE> 
    <P>Aubrey has recorded an amusing story, which the reader may believe or not as he thinks best, that Alleyn was frightened into his generous and charitable scheme by an apparition of the Prince of Darkness, <hi rend=italics>in propria persona</hi>, among <num value="6">six</num> theatrical demons in a certain piece in which he was playing.  In the fright thus occasioned he was said to have made a vow, which he redeemed by the founding of the College of God's Gift. 
    <P>The college was formally opened with great ceremony on the <datestruct VALUE="1619-09-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1619">1619</year></datestruct>; and Alleyn had the satisfaction of recording in his diary: <QUOTE>This day was the fowndacion of the Colledge finisht;</QUOTE> and so, in the quaint words of old Fuller, <QUOTE>He who out-acted others in his life, out-did himself before his death.</QUOTE> Amongst the distinguished guests on this occasion, of whom Alleyn gives a list, we find <QUOTE>the Lord Chancellor (Lord Bacon), the Lord of Arondell, Iord Ciecell (Cecil), Sir John Howland, High Shreve (Sheriff), and Inigo Jones, the king's surveyor.</QUOTE> He adds, <QUOTE>They   <num value="1">first</num> herd   a   Sermond, and   after the instrument of creacion was by me read, and after an anthem, they went to dinner.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Alleyn survived the opening of his college <num value="7">seven</num> years, but there is some difficulty in determining the exact day of his death. On the present tombstone (which is, however, of recent erection) it is stated to have been <datestruct VALUE="-11-21"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=21>21st</day></datestruct>; but documentary evidence seems to point to Saturday, <datestruct VALUE="-11-25"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=25>25th</day></datestruct>, as the correct date.

The almspeople and scholars were chosen in equal proportions from the <num value="4">four</num> parishes severally of St. Botolph without Bishopsgate; St. Saviour's, Southwark; St. Luke's, Middlesex; and St. Giles's, Camberwell.   In the letters patent a right was reserved to the founder to frame statutes for the government of the college. Alleyn seems, however, to have overrated the powers thus vested in him, and consequently several of his provisions, after long disputes and litigation, were set aside by the courts of law. 
   <P>The most important of the modifications introduced by Alleyn's maturer judgment into   his original scheme, it appears, were those designed to extend the basis of his educational foundation.  He now ordained that his school should be for the instruction of <num value="80">eighty</num> boys, consisting of <num value="3">three</num> distinct classes :--(<num value="1">1</num>) <num value="12">Twelve</num> poor scholars; (<num value="2">2</num>) children of inhabitants of Dulwich (who were to be taught freely); and (<num value="3">3</num>) <QUOTE>Towne or Forreign  Schollers,</QUOTE> who were to pay <QUOTE>such allowance as the master and warden should appoint.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Though to some extent the issue and production of the stage, Dulwich College never greatly benefited the members of the dramatic profession.  Alleyn had resolved to found and endow in his own lifetime an institution of a semi-monastic character, like the Charterhouse, for the reception of aged pensioners, and for the nurture and education of orphan boys. The original statutes and ordinances define the qualifications and duties of the several members of the college, and regulate the distribution of the income.   They embrace provisions which have many times proved a fruitful source of costly litigation.   Thus, the <num value="2">second</num> statute provides for a large addition, under the designation of <num value="6">six</num> <QUOTE>chanters,</QUOTE> <num value="6">six</num> assistants in the government of the college, and <num value="30">thirty</num> out-members, beyond the <hi rend=italics>personnel</hi> authorised by the letters patent. 
   <P>In the dietary for the boys is included <QUOTE>a up of beere</QUOTE> at breakfast and <QUOTE>beere without tint</QUOTE> at dinner, <QUOTE>with such increase of diett in .ent and gawdy days as the surveyor of diett may think fitt.</QUOTE> The beef and mutton for the boys were to be <QUOTE>sweet and good, their beere well mewed, and their bread well baked, and made of clean and sweete wheatten meal.</QUOTE> Their coats were to be of <QUOTE>good cloth, of sad cullor, the boddys lined with canvass.</QUOTE> A statute fixed <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years as the maximum term of a lease of any part of the college property. This restriction hampered more than any other the development of the college property, and it was eventually rescinded by the Dulwich Building Act of <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>Vacancies on the foundation, whether of scholars or old pensioners, or in the superior offices of fellow or warden, were to be filled up by the <QUOTE>drawing of lots</QUOTE> by <num value="2">two</num> selected candidates.   Even the mastership was to be filled up in the same way, if at the time of a vacancy there was no warden to succeed.   The manner of drawing the lots is minutely described in <num value="1">one</num> of the statutes, and the process continued in force till the re-organisation of the college in <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>. <QUOTE>God's Gift</QUOTE> was written on <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="2">two</num> equal small rolls of paper; the other roll was left blank. Both were placed in a box and shaken thrice up and down.   The elder of the <num value="2">two</num> selected candidates then took up <num value="1">one</num> roll, the younger took the other. The fortunate drawer of the God's Gift roll carried the prize. The founder's preference for the <num value="4">four</num> parishes from which the poor scholars and brethren and sisters should be selected was based   on his perception   of the doctrine that property has its duties as well as its rights.      As we have already seen, he owned theatres and houses in St. Saviour's and St. Luke's; his patrimonial estate was in St. Botolph's; and he had acquired by purchase the whole lordship of Dulwich, in the parish of Camberwell. 
    <P>In spite of Fuller's declaration that <QUOTE>no hospital is tyed with better or stricter laws, that it may not sagg (swerve) from the intention of the founder,</QUOTE> there can be little doubt that the want of elasticity in its original constitution prevented, for more than <num value="2">two</num> centuries, any healthy development of the college, and thus effectually frustrated the true <QUOTE>intentions</QUOTE> of Edward Alleyn.   Some partial attempts were made under injunctions of several  Archbishops of Canterbury, as visitors of Dulwich  College, to extend the educational benefits of the foundation; but little was really effected until the passing of the Act of Parliament in <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>, under the provisions of which the college is now administered. 
    <P> <QUOTE>The founder's scheme,</QUOTE> observes a writer in 
 <hi rend=italics>Macmillan's Magazine</hi>, <QUOTE>too rigid and inelastic to sustain the shock of modern notions, had long ceased to be seriously defended, even by those who dispensed its gifts and luxuriated in its most substantial rewards.   Hampered by the fixity of inflexible statutes, embarrassed by riches which it could not spend without shame, and which invited incessant onslaught from the <num value="4">four</num> interested <pb id="P.300" n="300"> parishes, Alleyn's College succumbed on the last day of <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct> to public opinion, released its members from monastic rule, sent them forth well pensioned into the outer world, and opened its gates next day to its new rulers.</QUOTE> 
   <P>By the Act of Parliament, passed in <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>, Alleyn's foundation was completely re-constituted. The government of the college is now vested in <num value="19">nineteen</num> governors, of whom <num value="11">eleven</num> are nominated by the Court of Chancery, the rest being elected by the <num value="4">four</num> parishes to, which special privileges were attached by the terms of the original foundation. The officers of administration are a <QUOTE>Master of the College</QUOTE> (whose office, however, is no longer restricted to a person of the founder's name), a Chaplain, an Under-Master of the Upper School, a Master of the Lower School, a Receiver, and a Clerk, together with such Assistant-Masters, Professors, and Lecturers as may be required to ensure thorough efficiency to the educational department. 
   <P>The revenue of the college, which at the time of the founder's death was <measure value="800l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="800">800</num></measure> a year, now amounts to more than     <measure value="17000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="17000">17,000</num></measure>.   The surplus revenue (after provision has been made for the maintenance of the fabric, and of the chapel and library) is divided

 into <num value="4">four</num> portions, of which <num value="3">three</num> are assigned to the educational and   <num value="1">one</num> to   the   eleemosynary branch.   The educational foundation comprises <num value="2">two</num> distinct schools--the <QUOTE>upper school</QUOTE> and the <QUOTE>lower school.</QUOTE> In the <QUOTE>upper school</QUOTE> liberal provision is made for the endowment of exhibitions, tenable either at <num value="1">one</num> of the English Universities, or by a student of any learned or scientific profession or of the fine arts.   Sundry scholarships of <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> a year, tenable in the school, were likewise established in <datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>, under authority of the Charity Commissioners.   The <QUOTE>lower school</QUOTE> is described as being for the instruction and benefit of the children of the industrial and poorer classes resident in any of the <num value="4">four</num> parishes. It is a separate school, and is entirely distinct in its conduct and arrangements from   the <QUOTE>upper school.</QUOTE> Provision is made for the establishment in the <QUOTE>lower school</QUOTE> of scholarships and <QUOTE>gratuities</QUOTE> to be awarded to deserving boys, for the purpose of advancing them   in the world. 
   <P>The old college, though the central attraction of the village, has but limited pretensions to architectural merit.   It has been thought by some topographers that it was built by the famous Inigo !

The fall of the tower so injured the revenues of the college, as to occasion its being suspended for <num value="6">six</num> months, during which time the master and fellows received no salary, but the poor people and scholars had <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> a week each. Not long after this another portion of the building fell down; and, in <datestruct value="1703--"><year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct>, the porch and other parts followed.   Frequent repairs were accordingly made, which were marked by dates in different parts of the old building. 
   <P>Dulwich College suffered its full share of the havoc committed by fanatics in the Civil Wars. It was turned into quarters for a company of soldiers of Fairfax's army, who, it is said, took up the leaden coffins in the chapel, and melted them into bullets. The fellows of the college were in arms for the king; in consequence of which they were deprived of their fellowships, and a schoolmaster and usher were appointed in their stead.

   <P>The old college buildings are spacious, having regard to the limited numbers for whom they were built, and comprise a chapel, dining-hall, parlour, library, school-room, kitchen, and appurtenances. They occupy <num value="3">three</num> sides of a square. The entrancegates are of curiously wrought iron, surmounted with the founder's arms, crest, and the motto, <QUOTE>God's Gift.</QUOTE> These lead into an outer court or green. The old chapel, a very plain structure, has long served as a chapel of ease, for this village, to the church of Camberwell.

In the chancel is a marble slab, marking the tomb of Edward Alleyn, the founder. 
   <P>A curious collection of pictures and portraits <pb id="P.302" n="302"> more remarkable, however, with a few exceptions, for their historical associations than for any artistic excellence, was bequeathed <num value="60">sixty</num> years after the founder's time by the grandson of his <hi rend=italics>confrere,</hi>
Cartwright. In this collection (including a few left by Alleyn) are striking and characteristic portraits of the founder himself; <num value="1">one</num> of Frobisher, the scourge of the Spaniards in the old Armada days; Michael Drayton, the poet, who, with Ben Jonson, was a guest at Shakespeare's table at that last <QUOTE>merry meeting,</QUOTE> a few days before his death; and also of many players who trod the same stage and shared the same social gatherings with Shakespeare and Alleyn, such as Burbage, Nathaniel Field, Sly, Bond, Perkins, and Cartwright.   These pictures were formerly hung in the corridors and staircases of the old college, but are now transferred to the new buildings.   In <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct> Mr. J. O. Halliwell exhibited before the Society of Antiquaries a copy of a pen-and-ink drawing from the back of a letter in Dulwich College, and supposed to be a portrait of Shakespeare, by Henslowe, to whom the letter is addressed.   The college, as might have been expected, was particularly rich in old plays; these were collected by Henslowe, Alleyn, and Cartwright, and were treasured here until Garrick acquired them from the then master, garden, and fellows, for the inadequate recompense of a parcel of new books.   The collection passed, on Garrick's decease, to the British Museum. 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.302.1">Great Hall, Dulwich College</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>The pictures mentioned above are in no way connected with those belonging to the Dulwich College Picture Gallery, which is situated at the south-west corner of the   old buildings.   The gallery was built from the designs and under the direction of Sir John Soane, and was <num value="1">first</num> opened to the public in the year <datestruct value="1817"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>.   The history of the collection is, in many ways, a remarkable <num value="1">one</num>. It owes its foundation to <QUOTE>a noble trio of benefactors.</QUOTE> Towards the close of the last century there was living in London, and plying there an active trade in pictures of the highest class, <num value="1">one</num> Noel Joseph Desenfans, who is considered to have been a keen critic of art, and a no less shrewd judge of a bargain.   He was a native of Douai, in France, but had settled in London <num value="1">first</num> of all as a teacher of languages.   His taste for art, however, and the advantageous sale of a <QUOTE>Claude</QUOTE> in his possession to George III. for <num value="1000">1,000</num> guineas, induced him to devote himself entirely to the more lucrative employment of a picture-dealer.   In course of time he was commissioned by the unhappy Stanislausthen almost in the dying throes of the fated kingdom   of Poland---to purchase pictures to form a National Gallery for Poland.   In his negotiations, Desenfans had been constantly aided by his friend Sir Francis Bourgeois, R.A.   On the overthrow of the Polish kingdom, Desenfans offered his pictures to the Czar, Paul I. of Russia, but without success; and in the end it became the nucleus of the Dulwich Gallery.   Desenfans spent the last few years of his life at the house of Sir Francis Bourgeois, in Charlotte Street, Portland Place, and on his death, in <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, bequeathed to him the whole of his large and valuable collection of pictures.   Bourgeois, like Desenfans, had no children to claim inheritance in it, and he resolved to carry out what appears to have been the desire also of his friend, and to place their joint collection of pictures in the custody of some public body for the encouragement of the study of fine arts.   An accidental acquaintance with <num value="1">one</num> of the fellows of the foundation, we are told, directed his attention to Dulwich College. Accordingly, in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, he bequeathed his pictures <QUOTE>to the master, wardens, and fellows of Dulwich College in trust for the public use, under the direction of the Royal Academy.</QUOTE> The bequest was accompanied by a condition that a mausoleum should be contained in the gallery, where his own remains and those of his <num value="2">two</num> friends, Monsieur and Madame Desenfans, should be placed.   A separate building attached to the rooms where the pictures hang was therefore erected for the purpose. The collection (including <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> pictures which have been presented subsequently by other donors, and a few unfinished sketches) consists of upwards of <num value="370">370</num> pictures.   It is particularly rich in works of the Dutch and Flemish schools, and contains examples of the Spanish schools which, it is said, are not surpassed by any in this country. The pictures are fully described by Dr. Waagen.<NOTE><title>Art and Artists in England</title>, vol. ii., pp. <num value="378">378</num>-<num value="389">389</num>.</NOTE>   <num value="1">One</num> of the chief ornaments in the gallery is the celebrated <QUOTE>Madonna</QUOTE> of Murillo.   At <num value="1">first</num> the gallery was opened to the public on Tuesdays only, and some little difficulty was thrown in the way of free access to the collection: all intending visitors were obliged to obtain tickets previously from <num value="1">one</num> or other of the great London printsellers, who were authorised to supply them <hi rend=italics>gratis</hi>, and notice was given both at the gallery and in the catalogue that <QUOTE>without a ticket no person can be admitted, and no tickets are given at Dulwich.</QUOTE> The limitation to a single day in the week was not long retained, and since <datestruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct> visitors have been admitted without tickets or introduction, on the sole condition of entering their name in the visitors' book. 
    <P>The new school buildings, now popularly known as <QUOTE>Dulwich College,</QUOTE> are situated about a quarter <pb id="P.303" n="303"> of a mile south of the old building.   They are in the <QUOTE>Northern   Italian style of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century,</QUOTE> and were built from the designs of Mr. Charles Barry. The <num value="1">first</num> stone of the new building was laid in <datestruct VALUE="1866-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>, and in <datestruct VALUE="1870-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>, the edifice was formally opened by the Prince of Wales. The schools comprise <num value="3">three</num> distinct blocks: viz., a central building, containing the public and official rooms, the great hall, the lecture-theatre, library, &amp;c.; and <num value="2">two</num> wings, connected with the centre building by corridors or cloisters--the south wing being appropriated to the senior section of the upper school, with the residence of the master of the college; and the north wing to the junior section, with the residence of the under-master of the upper school. The buildings are constructed of red brick with terra-cotta ornamentation, the front of the centre building being the most profusely ornamented; the decoration is carried entirely round the building. For the most part, the ornamentation is architectural, but a distinctive and characteristic feature is a series of heads, in very high relief, from concave shields, of the principal poets, historians, orators, philosophers, &amp;c., of Greece, Rome, Italy, Germany, and England--the names of each being legibly inscribed in the hollow of the shield. The cost of the new schools was about <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure>; the building provides accommodation for between <num value="600">600</num> and <num value="700">700</num> boys.   The college stands in an area of <num value="45">forty-five</num> acres, of which about <num value="30">thirty</num> acres have been appropriated to the schools and playground. The lower school is at present located in the old buildings of the college. 
   <P>There can be no doubt that the art-schools of the college owe much of their remarkable success to their association with the splendid collection of pictures forming the Dulwich Gallery.   It is at least certain that the study of art has been carried much farther and to higher perfection at Dulwich than at any other public school in the kingdom. On the annual <QUOTE>speech day,</QUOTE> when the distribution of prizes takes place, dramatic performances are given by the boys in the great hall; and from <num value="70">70</num>c to <num value="800">800</num> visitors can be readily accommodated on these occasions.   Since its new   birth, Dulwicb College has started on an era of educational advancement; and the extraordinary increase in the number of boys, and the numerous honours obtained by them in almost every competition open to our public schools--for this college holds its own both at Oxford and Cambridge--speaks eloquently, not only of the appreciation of the school throughout the districts south of the Thames, but of the great need which formerly existed there of increased educational facilities. 
    <P>In a small <hi rend=italics>brochure</hi>, entitled <QUOTE>Alleyn's College of God's Gift at Dulwich,</QUOTE> issued at the opening of the new schools in <datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>, the writer concludes: <QUOTE>Thus, after many struggles and difficulties, and a long period of lethargy more fruitless still, Dulwich  College has started at length into fresh and vigorous life, with powers of influence and means of usefulness which few foundations can rival, and with wellfounded hopes for the future which far surpass the utmost expectations of its pious and munificent founder.</QUOTE>

<P> <QUOTE>Nothing,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Laman Blanchard, in <QUOTE>A Guide to the Country round London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>can be more charmingly sylvan, or less suggestive of the approximate City, than the walk across the hill tc Sydenham, which reveals a varied and expansive prospect over Kent as we approach its precincts. The town lies in a hollow, and has a number o: opulent residents, whose elegant mansions con tribute to diversify the scene. On the commor has recently been built a handsome church, and along by the railway several stately villas have been called into being by the increased facilities of transit thus afforded, and the acknowledged salubrity of the air.</QUOTE> Since this was written, the air remains acknowledged as salubrious as ever; but bricks and mortar have increased, and there are now <num value="2">two</num> or more lines of railway running through the district, and Sydenham has become a place of great resort. 
   <P>Of old Sydenham was known only as a <QUOTE>genteel <pb id="P.304" n="304"> hamlet of Lewisham</QUOTE> --to which parish the greater part of it belongs-famed for its sylvan retreats; charming prospects, and, as we have stated in the preceding chapter, for its medicinal springs; but after the opening of the Croydon Railway, about the year   <datestruct value="1836"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>, it grew rapidly in favour as a place of residence, and still more rapidly after the opening of the Crystal Palace, on the summit of the hill, in <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>.   There have now sprung into existence long lines of villas, detached and semidetached cottages, terraces, so-called parks, and streets. 
    <P>It was about the middle of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century that the mineral waters were discovered on  Sydenham   Common; and they were occasionally resorted to down to comparatively recent times.  Evelyn, after visiting Dulwich College, <datestruct VALUE="1675-09-2"><month reg="09">September</month>  <day reg=2>2nd</day>, <year reg=1675>1675</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>came back [to Deptford] by certain medicinal spa waters, at a place called Sydnam  Wells, in Lewisham   parish, much frequented in summer.</QUOTE> The waters, according to <num value="1">one</num> authority, were <QUOTE>of a mild cathartic quality, nearly resembling those of Epsom ;</QUOTE> another writes, that they formed <QUOTE>a purging spring, which has performed great cures in scrofulous, scorbutic, paralytic, and other stubborn diseases;</QUOTE> whilst a <num value="3">third</num> asserts that the waters are <QUOTE>a certain cure for every ill to which humanity is heir.</QUOTE> Their popularity waned with that of the other English medicinal waters, but the Wells  House continued to attract as a place of summer entertainment, and it served for some time as the head-quarters of the St. George's Bowmen, till the enclosure of Sydenham   Common put an end to their archery practice.   The Church of St. Philip, in Wells Road, built in <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>-<num value="6">6</num>, covers the site of the wells; it is a neat cruciform structure, with apsidal chancel, and was built from the designs of Mr. Edwin Nash.   Mr. James Thorne, in his <QUOTE>Handbook of the Environs of London,</QUOTE> tells us there is still standing a cottage in which, according to local tradition, George III. once stayed the best part of a day, whilst he drank of the waters-an escort of the Life Guards forming a cordon around the cottage. 
   <P>Sydenham is of too modern a growth to have a history; but there are literary associations connected with the place, for <QUOTE>Gertrude of Wyoming</QUOTE> was written there, and its author, the <LEMMA id="lemma.304.1">poet Campbell</LEMMA>, is almost the only <QUOTE>eminent resident</QUOTE> of the place.   His house is on Peak Hill, near Sydenham Station, and, it is said, remains unaltered; but the gardens upon which it looked are gone.   Of Campbell, Cyrus Redding writes:-- <QUOTE>iris mode of life was mostly uniform with that which he afterwards followed in London when he made it his constant residence.   He rose not very early, breakfasted, studied for an hour or <num value="2">two</num>, dined a couple or <num value="3">three</num> hours after noon, and then made calls in the village, oftentimes remaining for an hour or more at the house of a maiden lady, of whose conversation he was remarkably fond.

I have ventured, on the faith of your support, to purchase the fixtures of a very excellent house, and about .<measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> worth of furniture, which, being sold along with the fixtures, I get at the broker's appraisement, <hi rend=italics>i.e</hi>., half the prime cost. . . . If you come to London, and drink to the health of Auld Reekie over my new mahogany table--if you take a walk round my garden and see my braw house, my court-yard, hens, geese, and turkeys, or view the lovely country in my neighbourhood-you will think this fixture and furniture money well bestowed. I shall, indeed, be nobly settled, and the devil is in it if I don't work as nobly for it.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Soon after, in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, Horner wrote as follows : <QUOTE>This morning I returned from a visit to our poet  Campbell.   He has fixed himself in a small house upon Sydenham Common, where he labours hard, and is perfectly happy with his wife and child. I have seldom   seen so strong an argument from experiment in favour of matrimony, as the change has operated on the general tone of his temper and morals.</QUOTE> Doubtless the poet was perfectly happy when he got away from the excitement of the City, and settled at Sydenham. 
   <P>The annual rental of Campbell's house was <num value="40">forty</num> guineas. It consists of <num value="6">six</num> rooms, <num value="2">two</num> on each floor, the attic or upper storey of which was converted into a private study. From this elevation Campbell, however, was often compelled to descend during the summer months for change of air to the parlour; for in the upper study he felt, to use his own words, as if enclosed within a hotly seasoned pie. A small garden behind the house, with the usual domestic offices at <num value="1">one</num> end, completed the habitation, and furnished all the conveniences to which either the poet or his amiable wife aspired. <QUOTE>Externally, the new situation had much,</QUOTE> writes <pb id="P.305" n="305"> Dr. Beattie, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>to soothe and interest a poetical mind.   From the south a narrow lane, lined with hedgerows and passing through a little dell watered by a rivulet, leads to the house, from the windows of which the eye wanders over an extensive prospect of undulating villas, park-like enclosures, hamlets, and picturesque villas shaded with fine ornamental timber, with here and there some village spire shooting up through the forest, reflecting the light on its vane, or breaking the stillness with the chime of its merry bells.   Ramifying in all directions he had shady walks where he was safe from all intrusion but that of the Muses, enabling him to combine healthful exercise with profitable meditation.

   <P>It was while at Sydenham   that the idea was started of a poets' club.   Let us give Campbell's account of the affair. <QUOTE><num value="1">One</num> day,</QUOTE> he writes- <QUOTE>and how can it fail to be memorable to me when Moore has commemorated it?-Rogers and Moore came down to Sydenham   pretty early in the forenoon, and stopped to dine with me. We talked of founding a poets' club, and set about electing the members--not by ballot, but <hi rend=italics>viva voce.</hi>
The scheme failed, I scarcely know how; but this I know, that a week or <num value="2">two</num> afterwards I met with Mr. Perry, of the <hi rend=italics>Morning Chronicle</hi>, who asked me how our poets' club was going on.   I said,  <Q>I don't know.   We have some difficulty in giving it a name.   We thought of calling ourselves <title>The Bees</title>. </Q>   <Q> Oh! </Q> said Perry,  <Q> that is a little different from the common report, for they say you are to be called <title>The Wasps</title>.</Q>  I was so stung with this waspish retort, that I thought no more of the poets' club.</QUOTE> 
   <P>At Campbell's house there were pleasant dinners, the guests including Byron, Rogers, Moore, Cyrus Redding, and the lesser wits of the day, including Thomas Hill, the original <title>Paul Pry</title>, who lived close by. Lady Charlotte Campbell, daughter of the Duke of Argyll, a poetess, and lover of learning, became the poet's neighbour at Sydenham.   She introduced her clansman to that literary <hi rend=italics>coterie</hi>
which frequented the <hi rend=italics>salons</hi> of the Princess of Wales at Blackheath.<NOTE>See p. <num value="230">230</num>.</NOTE>   Another lady who was living at Sydenham at the time Campbell was there, was Mrs. Allsop, a daughter of Mrs. Jordan, whom Campbell was the means of bringing out on the stage. 
   <P>Campbell resided here about <num value="16">sixteen</num> years, and during this period wrote <QUOTE>Gertrude of Wyoming,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>O&lsquo;Connor's Child,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>The Battle of the Baltic;</QUOTE> but in course of time he gave up his <QUOTE>noble</QUOTE> work for magazine management, editing, and hack writing, which perhaps redounded but little to his credit. When he undertook the editorship of the <hi rend=italics>New Monthly Magazine</hi> he gave up his Sydenham house, and removed to London. 
   <P>Campbell's convivialities, it seems, were not confined to his house. Sir Charles Bell, in <num value="1">one</num> of his <QUOTE>letters,</QUOTE> describes a visit he paid to the poet here, and how, after spending the evening in-doors, he and Campbell <QUOTE>rambled down the village, and walked under the delightful trees in the moonlight;</QUOTE> then <QUOTE>adjourned to the inn, and took an egg and plotty.   Tom   got glorious in pleasing gradation, &amp;c.   .   .   . His wife received him at home, not drunk, but in excellent spirits. After breakfast, we wandered over the forest; not a soul to be seen in all Norwood.</QUOTE> 
   <P><num value="2">Two</num> years before Campbell settled at Sydenham, a more unfortunate poet, Thomas Dermody, died there (<datestruct VALUE="1802-07-15"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=15>15</day>, <year reg=1802>1802</year></datestruct>), as we have already stated in our account of Lewisham   Church,<NOTE>See p. <num value="245">245</num>, <hi rend=italics>ante.</hi></NOTE> in abject misery, in a brickmaker's hut, at Perry Slough, now called Perry Vale, on the opposite side of the railway.   The house has long since been removed. 
   <P>Thomas Hill, whom we have mentioned above, was a well-known man in his day and generation. He was an eccentric drysalter in the City, who, gathering around him Horace and James Smith, John and Leigh Hunt, George Colman, Campbell, Theodore Hook, Barnes, Mathews, Redding, and a knot of literary acquaintances, set up in the days of the Regency as a sort of City Maecenas. He was something of an antiquary; knew everybody, and apparently everything about everybody; and was always bustling about the offices of the newspapers and magazines. Poole, the author of <title>Paul Pry</title>, is said to have drawn that character from him.   He was a sort of walking chronicle, especially where literary men and newspapers were concerned. It was once said of him   that if he stood at Charing Cross at noonday, he would tell the name and business of everybody that passed Northumberland House. Mathews always declared <QUOTE>Tom   Hill,</QUOTE> as he was called by all who loved him, <num value="1">one</num> of the oldest men he knew; and a writer in the <QUOTE>Railway Anecdote Book</QUOTE> thus speaks of him:-- <QUOTE>Mr. Hill was the <hi rend=italics>Hull</hi> of his friend Mr. <pb id="P.306" n="306"> Theodore Hook's clever novel of  <Q> Gilbert Gurney,</Q>  beyond comparison the best book of its class produced in our time.   It is also related that Hill furnished Mr. Poole with the original of his humorous character of  <Q>Paul Pry;</Q>  but this statement is very doubtful, for  <Q>Paul Pry,</Q>  if we mistake not, is of French extraction. It is, however, more certain that  <Q>Pooh, pooh! </Q>  and other habitual expressions of Mr. Hill's, may have been introduced by Mr. Poole into the character. Mr. Hill, it may here be added, had the <hi rend=italics>entree</hi> to both Houses of Parliament, the theatres, and almost all places of public resort.   He was to be met with at the private view of the Royal Academy, and every kind of exhibition. So especially was he favoured, that it was recorded by a wag that, when asked whether he had seen the new comet, he replied, Pooh, pooh! I was present at the private view! Mr. Hill, to borrow   from   Mr. Hook's portrait, happened to know everything that was going forward in all circles-mercantile, political, fashionable, literary, or theatrical; in addition to all matters connected with military and naval affairs, agriculture, finance, art, and science-everything came alike to him.</QUOTE>

   <P>Hill established   the <hi rend=italics>Monthly Mirror</hi>, which brought him much into connection with dramatic poets, actors, and managers.   To this periodical Kirke White became a contributor; and this encouragement induced him, about the close of the year <datestruct value="1802"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, to commit a little volume of poetry to the press. Southey, in his <QUOTE>Life of Kirke White,</QUOTE> refers to Mr. Hill as possessing <num value="1">one</num> of the most copious collections of English poetry in existence. 
   <P>While living at Sydenham, Mr. Hill received his numerous visitors in magnificent style.   On <num value="1">one</num> occasion some of the party had to walk to Dulwich to get a conveyance to town.   Campbell accompanied his friends. When they separated it was with hats off and <num value="3">three</num> boisterous cheers, <QUOTE>Campbell snatching off his hat,</QUOTE> says Cyrus Redding, <QUOTE>not wisely, but too well, pulled off his wig with it, and then, to enhance the merriment upon the occasion, flung both up in the air amidst unbridled laughter.</QUOTE> Mr. Adolphus was intimate with Hill for upwards of <num value="40">forty</num> years, and spoke of him as looking fresh and youthful to the last. With reference to his cottage at Sydenham, Mr. Adolphus remarks: <QUOTE>I have dined there with Campbell, James Smith, Jack Johnstone, Mathews, and other celebrities. <pb id="P.307" n="307"> Burgundy and champagne were given in abundance, and at that time, owing to the state of the war, they were of enormous price--I believe a guinea a bottle.</QUOTE> As was to be expected, Hill's affairs soon became deranged, and he was made a bankrupt. His fine library was not sold by auction, but by private contract to Messrs. Longman and Co., and formed the ground-work of that collection of which they published a catalogue, under the title of <QUOTE>Bibliotheca   Poetica Anglicana.</QUOTE> He died in chambers in the Adelphi, at the age of <num value="81">eighty-one</num>, in the year <datestruct value="1840"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, leaving a fortune of   <measure value="15000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="15000">15,000</num></measure> to a stray friend who used to dine with him on Sundays at Hampstead.   The following burlesque epitaph on him is from the pen of Cyrus Redding:--

   <P>In   the early part of the present century, in Sydenham   and its environs, <num value="800">eight hundred</num> acres of common-land were enclosed; and now nearly the whole has been formed into streets, so that this once beautiful rural district is rapidly becoming an integral part of the great metropolis, Sydenham chapelry alone having a population of more than <num value="25000">25,000</num>, and the place altogether comprises some half-dozen ecclesiastical districts. The Church of St. Bartholomew, on what was once Sydenham Common, is a roomy and commodious Gothic edifice, and was erected in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>. Christ Church, near the Forest Hill railway station, was consecrated in <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>, but was only recently completed by the erection of a tower and chancel; it is in the Early Decorated style of architecture. Holy Trinity Church, Sydenham Park, is of similar architecture, and was built in <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>.   St. Saviour's, on Brockley <pb id="P.308" n="308"> Hill, at the north extremity of Sydenham, is a large Decorated building, and was consecrated in <datestruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>. St. Michael and All Angels', Lower Sydenham, serves as a chapel of ease to St. Bartholomew's. Of St. Philip's, in Wells Road, we have already spoken.   Besides these places of worship, there are Free, Presbyterian, Wesleyan, and other chapels; many schools, both public and private; public halls, library and working men's institutes, local societies, and <num value="2">two</num> weekly newspapers. 
   <P>The most important feature in connection with Sydenham is the <LEMMA id="lemma.308.1">Crystal Palace</LEMMA>; we say in connection with, for, though not actually in Sydenhamthe greater part being said to be in Lambeth parish --it is always considered to belong to it. It occupies the high ground to the south-west of Sydenham. The land over which the palace grounds-nearly <num value="300">three hundred</num> acres in extent-stretch, falls rapidly away to the east, and from the terrace in front of the palace a prospect is obtained of surpassing beauty, over richly-wooded and undulating plains to the distant hills of Kent and Surrey. A little to the north of the palace, and overlooking the grounds, stands Rockhill, from <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct> the residence of Sir Joseph Paxton, the designer of the Crystal Palace, the Great Exhibition building of <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>, of Chatsworth conservatory and gardens, &amp;c. 
   <P>Sir Joseph Paxton, who was originally introduced to the Duke of Devonshire by his Grace's secretary, Mr. Ridgway, of May Fair, came into his service as a gardener's lad at <measure value="14s." type=currency><num value="14">fourteen</num> shillings</measure> a week. He soon showed, however, talents which led to his advancement, and laid out the gardens at Chatsworth in a manner worthy of <QUOTE>Capability</QUOTE> Brown<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="154">154</num>.</NOTE>
himself. As Mr. Mark Boyd tells us in his <QUOTE>Social Gleanings,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Great was Mr. Ridgway's astonishment when, some years afterwards, he sat down to dinner at Chiswick with the duke and the other members of the family, and found himself seated by the side of the former gardener's lad, they being the only guests who were not Cavendishes or Leveson- Gowers.</QUOTE> Sir Joseph Paxton designed the Crystal Palace on the plan of a large conservatory which he had erected at Chatsworth, and had the satisfaction of seeing his principles of construction adopted extensively in railway stations and other large structures before his death. He sat for some years as M.P. for Coventry, through the duke's interest, and died at his house at Sydenham in <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>As we have already stated,<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="38">38</num>.</NOTE> it was in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct> that the idea of erecting the Crystal Palace near Sydenham <num value="1">first</num> originated. When the Government dedined to purchase the Great Exhibition building in Hyde Park, a few enterprising gentlemen came forward and rescued it from destruction. They purchased it, and the materials were removed to Sydenham, where it was re-erected, but with many modifications of form and detail. The original projectors had no difficulty in securing the aid of Sir Joseph Paxton as director of the park and gardens, which it was intended to unite with the palace; of Mr. Owen Jones and Mr. Digby Wyatt, as directors of the fine art department and of the decorations; and of Mr. Charles Wild, the engineer of the old building, as the engineer for the new <num value="1">one</num>. Sir Charles Fox and Mr. Henderson also were engaged as contractors, and they undertook to take down, remove, and re-erect the structure for <measure value="120000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="120000">120,000</num></measure>. The <QUOTE>Crystal Palace Company</QUOTE> was then announced, with a capital of <measure value="500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500000">500,000</num></measure>, in <num value="100000">100,000</num> shares of <measure value="5l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5">5</num></measure> each. The capital, however, was subsequently increased to <measure value="1000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000000">1,000,000</num></measure>, and before the works in the building and grounds were concluded this amount was considerably increased. <num value="2">Two</num> years were spent in extensive and expensive preparations. The <num value="1">first</num> column of the main structure was raised on the <datestruct VALUE="1852-08-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>. Messrs. Owen Jones and Digby Wyatt were charged with a mission to the Continent, in order to procure examples of the principal works of art in Europe. England was also searched for copies of artistic antiquities; and Sir Joseph Paxton commenced his own operations by securing for the company the extensive and celebrated collection of palms and other plants which it had taken the Messrs. Loddige, of Hackney,<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="514">514</num>.</NOTE> a century to collect. The building was formally opened on the <datestruct VALUE="1854-06-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>, the Queen, the Prince Consort, the King of Portugal, and other distinguished personages, being present at the ceremony. 
   <P>In several points the Crystal Palace at Sydenham differs from its predecessor in Hyde Park. There are <num value="3">three</num> transepts instead of <num value="1">one</num>, and the roof of the nave is arched instead of flat, being thus raised <num value="44">forty-four</num> feet higher than the old nave. There are many other differences between the appearance of the old and new Crystal Palaces, but these are among the chief. As before, iron and glass are almost the only materials used in the building. The larger portion of the northern wing, including the tropical department and the Assyrian Court, was destroyed by fire on the <datestruct VALUE="1866-12-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>, and has been only partially rebuilt since. 
   <P>Originally the main building was <num value="1608">1,608</num> feet long, while its prototype was <num value="1851">1,851</num> feet; but there are <pb id="P.309" n="309"> wings and a colonnade in the new building, which make a considerable addition in the total length. These wings extend into, and, as it were, enclose the Italian garden. The nave and north and south transepts are <num value="72">72</num> feet wide and   <num value="104">104</num> feet highjust the height of the transept in the Hyde Park building.   The central transept is the feature of the new building. It is <num value="384">384</num> feet long (the north and south transepts being <num value="336">336</num>), <num value="120">120</num> feet wide, and <num value="168">168</num> feet from the floor to the top of the ventilator --its total height, from   the garden front, being <num value="208">208</num> feet, or <num value="6">six</num> feet higher than the Monument. Another difference in the   construction   of this building is that there is a basement storey, which was long known by the appellation of <QUOTE>Sir Joseph Paxton's Tunnel.</QUOTE> This basement storey, or tunnel, contains apparatus for warming the building by rows of furnaces and boilers, and an iron network forming <num value="50">fifty</num> miles of steam-pipes.     There   are about <num value="30">thirty</num> boilers, arranged in pairs along the tunnel at regular distances. At each extremity of the building are lofty towers.   The west front of the palace abuts upon a broad roadway, formed out of Dulwich Wood; it is a light and airy facade, resembling that of the north side of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, except that it presents <num value="3">three</num> arched transepts to the eye instead of only <num value="1">one</num>. Attractive as this front of the palace is, that to the east, as seen from the gardens, is much more so. Grace and elegance are certainly combined in the outline; and when   the vast edifice reflects the rays of the sun, it sends forth millions of coruscations, and forms an object of surpassing brilliance. The following lines, by a popular poet, appeared shortly after the completion of the building :

               <L>A blazing arch of lucid glass

    <P>In the interior there is a long and lofty nave, intersected at regular distances and at right angles by <LEMMA id="lemma.310.1"><num value="3">three</num> transepts</LEMMA>, and with aisles on each side, occupied by various fine art, industrial, and architectural courts, surrounded by galleries supported on light, airy, and apparently fragile columns, with an arched roof of glass, extending from north to south upwards of <num value="1000">1,000</num> feet. There are <num value="2">two</num> galleries--in the central transept <num value="3">three</num>; the <num value="1">first</num> is gained from the ground by <num value="8">eight</num> flights of steps, <num value="1">one</num> at each end of the north and south transepts, and <num value="2">two</num> at each end of the centre transept; they are about <num value="23">twenty-three</num> feet high. This gallery is <num value="24">twenty-four</num> feet wide; and the landing-places, in the <num value="2">two</num> end transepts, <num value="72">seventy-two</num> feet long and <num value="24">twenty-four</num> feet wide, form platforms from which excellent views of the nave are obtained.

This gallery, as well as the <num value="2">second</num>, is used only as a promenade.   The passage along the latter is carried through a series of ring or <QUOTE>bull's-eye</QUOTE> girders, <num value="7">seven</num> feet in diameter, resting upon the columns which project into the nave. There is a very fine view of the country from this gallery; and looking forward through the long vista of circular girders, diminishing gradually in the distant perspective, produces a very singular but fine effect. The view of the park and grounds from the <num value="3">third</num> gallery will well repay the visitor for the trouble of ascent. <QUOTE>Round the upper gallery,</QUOTE> Mr. Phillips informs us in his <QUOTE>Guide,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>at the very summit of the nave and transepts, as well as round the groundfloor of the building, are placed louvres, or ventilators, made of galvanised iron.   By opening or closing these louvres, a service readily performed, the temperature of the Crystal Palace is so regulated, that, on the hottest day of summer, the dry parching heat mounts to the roof to be dismissed, whilst a pure and invigorating supply is introduced at the floor in its place, giving new life to the thirsty plant, and fresh vigour to man. The coolness thus obtained within the palace will be sought in vain, on such a summer's day, outside the edifice.</QUOTE> At night the building is very effectively lighted up from above by the aid of a row of jets <pb id="P.310" n="310"> which run round it, just below the spring of the arching roof.

    <P>It would be impossible to give within the limits of this work a detailed account of all the varied attractions of the interior of the building; and, indeed, such a task is rendered needless by the <QUOTE>Guide to the Palace and Park,</QUOTE> and the Handbooks to the various Courts, which are published by the Crystal Palace Company, and obtainable in the building.   A rough glance at the contents, therefore, is all that we can here pretend to take.  Commencing at the southern extremity of the nave, immediately in front of the refreshment counters, is a Gothic screen, consisting of a centre and <num value="2">two</num> wings, in which are placed, in niches, statues of the kings and queens of England, from casts of those statues in the new Houses of Parliament; this screen was designed by Mr. Digby  Wyatt.   From this spot a view of the whole extent of the nave is obtained, and a beautiful view it is. Immediately in front of the spectator is a large ornamental basin, in which is displayed the  Victoria Regia and other tropical aquatic plants; in the centre of the basin stands what has been not inaptly termed <QUOTE>the world-famed crystal fountain,</QUOTE> <NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="38">38</num>.</NOTE>   which on the break--up of the Great Exhibition of <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>   became the property of the directors of the new Crystal Palace. Beyond this, the eye rests upon a long vista, varied on each side with statues, handsome glass cases, displaying various works of modern art and industry, and trees, flowers, and plants, of the tropical regions, blooming in all the brilliance of their native climes; whilst suspended from the galleries are ornamental baskets containing plants. 
   <P>The Handel Festival Orchestra, which occupies the western portion of the great central transept, was originally erected for the <num value="1">first</num> festival in <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>, and has been since gradually enlarged, until it reached its present pitch of size and completeness. Its diameter is double that of the dome of St. Paul's. At the festival concerts more than <num value="4000">4,000</num> instrumental and vocal performers are accommodated within its spacious area. The arch which forms the ceiling of the vast structure-<num value="1">one</num> of the largest timber arches yet erected--is of the latest improvement.   The organ was built by Messrs. Gray and Davison, expressly for the palace; it has <num value="4">four</num> rows of keys, and contains <num value="74">seventy-four</num> stops and <num value="4598">4,598</num> pipes. 
   <P>At the eastern end of the transept, facing the great orchestra, is the theatre, in which are given dramatic performances, pantomimes, &amp;c.   Close by is a concert-room capable of containing a large number of performers and listeners, and generally filled on the occasion of the popular concerts given here on Saturday afternoons. 
    <P>On either side of the nave, on the floor of the palace, are the various courts above referred to, the mere mention of the names of which is sufficient to indicate their nature and character; they are the <LEMMA id="lemma.310.6">Egyptian</LEMMA>, Greek, Roman, Mediaval, Renaissance, Italian, French, Ceramic, Pompeian,  Bohemian, &amp;c.   A large portion of the galleries is devoted to the exhibition and sale of pictures, forming <num value="1">one</num> of the main centres of attraction in the building.

    <P>Leaving the palace by the flight of granite steps from   the central transept, we reach the <QUOTE>upper terrace,</QUOTE> which extends along the whole base of the building; it is <num value="1500">1,500</num> feet long and <num value="50">50</num> feet wide. <num value="15">Fifteen</num> feet lower lies the terrace garden, reached by <num value="6">six</num> flights of steps, and bounded on the southern side by a stone balustrade, with numerous recesses. Besides the magnificent central circular basin, throwing out a lofty <hi rend=italics>jet d&lsquo;eau</hi>, there are numerous others of an elliptic shape, profusely intermingled with statues, vases, richly-coloured flower-beds, shrubs, and trees, on which the long shadows of the projecting transepts fall. From the terrace gardens <num value="3">three</num> flights of stone steps, their side balustrades adorned in like manner with statuary, conduct the visitor to a garden <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet lower. 
   <P>A central walk, nearly ioo feet in breadth, leads from the centre of the terrace garden through the lower garden, where it divides, and, re-uniting on the other side of a basin, <num value="200">200</num> feet in diameter, continues on through parterres, laid out in a graceful admixture of the Italian and English styles of ornamental gardening. 
   <P>The extent of the ground in which these fountains are displayed is ingeniously made to appear greater than it really is, by the skilful mode in which it has been treated. Broken ground, mounds, artificially constructed, crowned with forest trees, and groves of rich evergreen shrubs, forming tortuous alleys of perpetual verdure, and intersecting each other in the most natural manner, impart the effect of size and distance to a space that is comprised in about <num value="200">two hundred</num> acres.   <num value="2">Two</num> <QUOTE>water temples</QUOTE> and a <QUOTE>rosary</QUOTE> are amongst the most attractive objects in the gardens; but unquestionably the most prominent attraction of the grounds, irrespective of their natural beauty, is formed by the system   of waterworks, which, it is said, far surpass, in their completeness and design, any other display in the world, including even those of

 <pb id="P.311" n="311"> Versailles.   The whole system is divided into <num value="2">two</num> series--the upper and lower.   The former comprises the <num value="6">six</num> basins in the Italian garden, the large central basin in the broad walk, and the <num value="2">two</num> smaller ones on each side of it; in all, <num value="9">nine</num> fountains. These constitute the display on ordinary occasions.   Beyond and below them is the lower series, which consist of the <num value="2">two</num> water temples, the cascades, and the numerous groups of fountains arranged in the large lower basins.   These are usually known as the <QUOTE>great fountains,</QUOTE> and are played on special and grand occasions only. The <num value="2">two</num> <QUOTE>grand</QUOTE> fountains in the lower grounds are by far the largest in the world, and impart the grandest effect to the whole series. The outlines of their <num value="2">two</num> greatest basins are similar in design, each being <num value="784">784</num> feet long, with a diameter of <num value="468">468</num> feet.   The central jet in each is <num value="2.25">2 1/4</num>- inches diameter, and reaches the extraordinary height of more than <num value="250">250</num> feet.   Around each central jet is a column, composed of <num value="50">fifty</num> <num value="2">2</num>-inch jets.   The force of water which presses on the mouth of these pipes is equivalent to <measure value="262l." type=currency><num value="262">262</num> pounds</measure> to the square inch. When the whole is in operation, <num value="120000">120,000</num> gallons of water per minute are poured forth by <num value="11788">11,788</num> jets; and in <num value="1">one</num> single complete display, lasting half an hour, nearly <num value="4000000">4,000,000</num> gallons are consumed. The artesian well, from which the fountains are supplied with water, is well worthy of notice.   It is a brick shaft, <num value="81">81</num> feet in diameter and <num value="247">247</num> feet deep. From   this depth an artesian bore descends still further for <num value="328">328</num> feet, making the entire distance from   the surface <num value="578">578</num> feet. A   supply of water having been thus obtained, the next operation is to raise it from the bottom of the hill, where the well is situate, to a sufficient height to play the fountains. The pressure required to force the respective jets of water to heights ranging from <num value="5">5</num> to nearly <num value="300">300</num> feet is obtained in the following simple manner. Reservoirs were formed at different levels in the grounds, the highest of all being situated at the top of the hill adjoining the north end of the building; the <num value="2">second</num>, or intermediate reservoir, was on a level with the basin of the great central fountain; and the lower lake, at the extreme end of the grounds, formed the lower reservoir. <num value="3">Three</num> pairs of powerful engines were then erected; <num value="1">one</num> contiguous to the artesian well; the <num value="2">second</num> at the intermediate reservoir; and a <num value="3">third</num> adjoining the north end of the building, close to the highest reservoir.   By this system water is pumped by the lower engine to the intermediate reservoir, and from thence by another engine to the upper level, where a <num value="3">third</num> raises it to <num value="2">two</num> enormous tanks, erected on columns, and to the tanks on the top of the <num value="2">two</num> high towers, which play the main jets of the lower fountains.   By this arrangement the water, instead of being wasted, is economised, and passing backwards and forwards from <num value="1">one</num> reservoir to the other, is used again and again; the intermediate reservoir collecting it after a display of the upper series, and the lowest <num value="1">one</num> forming a similar receptacle when a display of the large fountains takes place.

   <P>Passing round the margin of the <LEMMA id="lemma.311.2">great fountain basin</LEMMA>, and crossing the broad central walk, which divides the <num value="2">two</num> lower basins, the visitor, by ascending a flight of steps, reaches the grand plateau, which is an embankment <num value="50">fifty</num> feet wide, and commands a general view of the lake, containing <num value="3">three</num> islands, the <num value="2">two</num> largest wholly occupied by lifesized models of the gigantic animals of the ancient world.   It is here that <num value="1">one</num> of the most original features of the Crystal Palace Company's grand plan of instruction has been carried out. There all the leading features of geology are found displayed, in so practical and popular a manner, that a child may discern the characteristic points of that useful branch of the history of nature. 
   <P>The spectator, standing on the upper terrace of the plateau, has before him the largest educational model ever attempted in any part of the world. It covers several acres, and consists of a display of nearly all the rocks that constitute the known portion of the earth's crust, from the old red sandstone to the latest tertiary beds of drift and gravel. Descending by the path, a few paces to the right, we have a nearer view of the older rocks, immediately facing   the   rustic bridge, the lowest of which, the old red sandstone, is seen just above the water, forming a foundation upon which is superposed the whole mass of cliff on the right, consisting of mountain limestone, mill-stone grit, bands of ironstone, and beds or seams of coal, capped by the new   red sandstone.   The coalmeasures are thus exhibited between their most evident boundaries, the old red sandstone below, and the new red sandstone above; the whole being re-constructed of several <num value="1000">thousand</num> tons of the actual materials, in exact imitation of the Clay Cross coalbeds.   The series was carefully tabulated by Professor Ansted, to ensure its geological accuracy, according to Sir Joseph Paxton's designs for the picturesque arrangement of this interesting portion of the grounds. 
   <P>On the margin of a lake close by are to be seen life-like models of the former gigantic inhabitants of the earth, whose race has long since become extinct, such as the Iguanodon, the Paleotherium, the Anoplotherium, and other antediluvian animals, <pb id="P.312" n="312">

 fine air and fun. What Londoners want is  <Q>an outing.</Q>  It is for this that people go to Sydenham; and for this, it must be admitted on all sides, the most complete provision has now been made.   If <num value="1">one</num> really requires a wonder, there is the building itself.</QUOTE> 
   <P>We have alluded above to the accidental fire by which a portion of the building was destroyed. This occurred on the <datestruct VALUE="1866-12-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>; and the larger portion of the northern wing, including the tropical department and the Assyrian Court, was burnt down. An unfortunate chimpanzee, which had been <num value="1">one</num> of the <QUOTE>lions</QUOTE> of the palace, perished in the flames. This wing has only been partially rebuilt, much to the injury of the symmetry of the edifice. Whatever may have been the cause of this disastrous fire, it was, at all events, a curious fact that it occurred on the very day after a lecture on combustion had been given in the palace. 
   <P>Of late years a large library and reading-room have been added, and lectures on cookery and other branches of useful education, as well as on art and science, have been delivered to numerous classes of students of either sex. A large aquarium also, <pb id="P.314" n="314"> stocked with salt-water as well as fresh-water fish, now forms <num value="1">one</num> of the attractions of the place; and it is intended by the managers and directors of the company still further to increase the educational appliances of the Crystal Palace. 
    <P>Anerley, which adjoins Sydenham on the southeast, was at <num value="1">one</num> time noted for its tea-gardens, which for some years served as an attraction to the South Londoners.   They were opened in or about the year <datestruct value="1841"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct> by a Mr. Coulson, but do not appear to have attained to a tithe of the popularity of old Ranelagh or of Vauxhall, notwithstanding its swings and <QUOTE>roundabouts,</QUOTE> its fireworks, and its <hi rend=italics>al fresco</hi>   dancing platforms.      After passing through various hands, they were finally closed in <datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>. A corner of the gardens was taken off on the formation of the Croydon Railway.   The Croydon Canal, which formerly ran through the grounds in its course from the Thames at Deptford, has been drained and filled up for several miles, with the exception of a few places in which it remains as ornamental water. 
   <P>Stretching away from Anerley, towards Mitcham, Tooting, and Streatham, and lying partly in Croydon parish, and partly in the parishes of Battersea, Lambeth, Streatham, and Camberwell, is Norwood, which, at no very remote period, was described as <QUOTE>a village scattered round a large wild common,</QUOTE> and as <QUOTE>a principal haunt of the gypsies.</QUOTE> The Crystal Palace, though always described as in Sydenham, is said really to belong partly to Norwood, and the high ground on which it stands, together with the rival hills of Hampstead and Highgate, may be regarded as sentinel castles on either side of the valley of the Thames. 
   <P>In a <title>History of the Gypsies</title>, published in the <num value="1">first</num> part of the present century, it is said that Norwood had long been a favourite haunt of that brotherhood, on account of its remote and rural character, though lying so handy for both London and Croydon.   It appears that besides being occasionally brought before the magistrates for robberies of chickens and other denizens of the farm-yard, the gipsies here were occasionally made by the justices to feel the full force of the laws against vagrancy, and that occasionally they were <QUOTE>hunted down</QUOTE> without having done much to deserve it, being made the scapegoats of others who had fairer skins.   Hither the Londoners of the last century resorted in fine weather to have their future lot in life foretold to them by the palmistry of the <QUOTE>Zingari</QUOTE> folk. 
   <P>Gipsy Hill, and an inn still called the <QUOTE>Queen of the Gipsies,</QUOTE> commemorate the inmate of a small outhouse who lived on this hill, and who died here in <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>--it is said at the age of <num value="109">109</num> years.   Her name was <LEMMA id="lemma.314.1">Margaret Finch</LEMMA>, and for half a century she had lived by telling fortunes in that rural and credulous neighbourhood. She was buried in a deep square box, as, from her constant habit of sitting with her chin resting on her knees, her muscles had become so contracted that at last she could not alter her position. <QUOTE>This woman,</QUOTE> observes Mr. Larwood, in his <title>History of Sign-boards</title>, <QUOTE>when a girl of <num value="17">seventeen</num>, may have been <num value="1">one</num> of the dusky gang that pretty Mrs. Samuel Pepys and her companions went to consult in <datestruct VALUE="1668-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>, as her lord records in his  <Q>Diary</Q>  the same evening, the  <num value="11">11th</num>:  <Q>This afternoon my wife, and Mercer, and Deb went with Pelling to see the gypsies at Lambeth and have their fortunes told; but what they did I did not enquire.</Q> </QUOTE>  <QUOTE>A granddaughter of Margaret Finch,</QUOTE> Mr. Larwood adds, <QUOTE>was living in a cottage close by in the year <datestruct value="1800"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Norwood must really have derived its name from being the <QUOTE>wood</QUOTE> that lay to the <QUOTE>north</QUOTE> of the large ecclesiastical town of Croydon; for it lies to the south of London.   <num value="2">Two</num> centuries ago Norwood was really a wood and nothing more. Aubrey, giving an account of Croydon at that period, in his <title>Perambulation of Surrey</title>, writes : 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>In this parish lies the great wood, called <hi rend=italics>Norwood,</hi>
belonging to the see of Canterbury, wherein was an ancient remarkable tree, called Vicar's Oak, where <num value="4">four</num> parishes meet in a point.</QUOTE> These parishes, doubtless, were Lambeth, Camberwell, Lewisham, and Croydon. 
   <P>The wood and the gipsies too have long since been swept away, and are now known only by tradition. Among the few mansions of note that once existed in this neighbourhood, the most conspicuous was Knight's Hill, which was built for Lord Chancellor Thurlow   by Henry Holland, the architect of Carlton House and of old Drury Lane Theatre, which was burnt down in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>. Notwithstanding the splendid views said to be obtained from the upper windows of the mansion, it appears that Lord Thurlow never resided in it, but contented himself with a smaller house, called Knight's Hill Farm.   In Twiss's <QUOTE>Life of Lord Eldon,</QUOTE> it is stated that <QUOTE>Lord Thurlow built a house in the neighbourhood of London.   Now,</QUOTE> adds the author, <QUOTE>he was <num value="1">first</num> cheated by his architect, and then he cheated himself; for the house cost more than he expected, so he never would go into it. Very foolish, but so it was. As he was coming out of the Queen's Drawing-room, a lady, whom I knew very well, stopped him, and asked him when he was going into his new house. <pb id="P.315" n="315">  <Q>Madam,</Q>  said he,  <Q>the queen has just asked me that impudent question; and as I would not tell her, I will not tell you.</Q> </QUOTE> Mr. Thorne, in his <QUOTE>Environs of London,</QUOTE> states that the house and grounds were reported to have cost <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure>. Both have now   disappeared, having, with   his lordship's   adjoining   manor of Leigham, been appropriated for building purposes. 
   <P>Another noted place in Upper Norwood, during the <num value="2">second</num> quarter of the present century, was Beulah Spa, which was founded on an extensive scale in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>, for the purpose of rendering available the medicinal properties of a spring strongly impregnated with sulphate of magnesia. The Spa had been known to the inhabitants of Norwood from time immemorial; but it existed only as a bubbling spring, to which the rustics resorted for the cure of trifling maladies, until about the year <datestruct value="1828"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, when the then proprietor of the surrounding grounds, some <num value="30">thirty</num> acres in extent, expended large sums in converting them   into a place of recreation, with charming walks, terraces, and rustic lodges, a <QUOTE>pump,</QUOTE> orchestra, reading-room, &amp;c., the whole being carried out from the designs of Mr. Decimus Burton.   In its altered state it was opened for public use in <datestruct VALUE="1831-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>. It is now forgotten as a place of resort, and even its chalybeate spring has passed comparatively out of memory. The water was a saline purgative, much resembling the Cheltenham water, and, like that of the Epsom water, owed its medical qualities chiefly to the sulphate of magnesia which was dissolved in it; but some other saline substances, as sulphate of soda, common or marine salt, and chloride of sodium, were likewise contained in this water in small proportions. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct> <hi rend=italics>a fete</hi> for the Freemasons' Girls' School was given here, under the special patronage of the Queen Dowager.   The vocal and instrumental concert provided for the occasion was of <num value="1">first</num>-rate order; Grisi, Persiani, Rubini, Ivanhoff, &amp;c., lending their assistance on the occasion. 
    <P>The readers of Thackeray will not have forgotten the charityfete at Beulah Spa, devised by Lady de  Sudley, on behalf of the <QUOTE>British Washerwoman's  Orphans' Home,</QUOTE> which figures in Cox's <QUOTE>Diary.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The Spa is thus described by a writer in the 
 <hi rend=italics>Mirror</hi> for <datestruct VALUE="1832-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct> :-- <QUOTE>We entered the grounds at an elegant rustic lodge, where commences a new carriage-road to Croydon, which winds round the flank of the hill, and is protected by hanging woods.   The lodge is in the best taste of ornate rusticity, with the characteristic varieties of gable, dripstone, portico, bay-window, and embellished chimney; of the latter there are some specimens in the best style of our older architects. Passing the lodge, we descended by a winding path through the wood to a small lawn or glade, at the highest point of which is a circular rustic building, used as a confectionery and reading-room, near which is the Spa, within a thatched apartment. The spring rises about <num value="14">fourteen</num> feet, within a circular rockwork enclosure; the water is drawn by a contrivance at once ingenious and novel; a glass urn-shaped pail, terminating with a cock of the same material, and having a stout rim and cross-handle of silver, is attached to a thick worsted rope, and let down into the spring by a pulley, when the vessel being taken up full, the water is drawn off by the cock.</QUOTE> Notwithstanding that the grounds were furnished with all the appliances for well-to-do water-drinkers, Beulah Spa enjoyed but a brief run of popularity. In the end it collapsed, and the site was handed over to the builders.   Some portion   of the grounds, however, have been preserved; and there is (or was recently) within them   a hydropathic establishment, where the curative qualities of the water may be tested. 
   <P>On the hill overlooking what was once Beulah Spa, Mr. Sims Reeves has lived for many years. 
   <P>Norwood is situated on a series of beautiful valleys and hills, the latter rising, it is said, to the height of <num value="300">300</num> feet above the level of the sea at low water; but, like Sydenham, is being rapidly converted into a region of bricks and mortar. It possesses <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> churches, a large number of dissenting chapels and mission-houses, capacious and comfortable hotels, together with hydropathic and homceopathic establishments.   The Queen's Hotel at Norwood, close to the Crystal Palace, is said to be the largest private hotel in the kingdom. 
   <P>Among the institutions of various kinds which abound in this locality, a prominent place is held by the North Surrey District School, in the Anerley Road.   It is a very large and complete establishment, covering an area of about <num value="50">fifty</num> acres. It provides accommodation and the means of industrial training for nearly <num value="1000">1,000</num> children from the surrounding district unions. 
   <P>The Roman Catholic Orphanage of Our Lady, founded in <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct>, is under the charge of a religious community of ladies, and contains about <num value="320">320</num> orphan and poor children, who are lodged, fed, and clothed, until they are fit to be placed in situations as domestic servants, for which they are specially trained. The children, when placed in service, are watched over by the community, who give prizes annually to those who keep their situations   longest, and   can   supply the   best characters. There is also a home attached, into <pb id="P.316" n="316"> which the orphans are received   when   out of situation and in sickness, provided they have conducted themselves satisfactorily. The institution is a branch from the Monastery de la Notre Dame des Orphelines, at La Delwrande, in Normandy, celebrated for its treatment of orthopoedic diseases, from which many English families are said to have derived great benefit.   The building here was commenced in <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>, and was erected from   the designs of Mr. Wardell. It is of Gothic design, with a tower in the centre, and covers a large extent of ground. A part of the edifice, entirely distinct from the orphanage, is used as a boardingschool for young ladies of the higher classes. 
   <P>Noticeable for its architectural as well as philanthropic character is the <LEMMA id="lemma.316.1">Jews' Hospital</LEMMA>, Lower Norwood, which was erected in <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct>, from   the designs of Mr. Tillot, <QUOTE>for the maintenance of the aged poor, and the industrial training of friendless children.</QUOTE> The Jews' Hospital, <num value="1">one</num> of the oldest charitable institutions of the Jews in England, was originally established in Mile End, in the year <datestruct value="1806"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>. Large sums were collected by its founders, Messrs. B. and A. Goldsmid; considerable legacies have been bequeathed to it; the benevolent family of Rothschild have greatly benefited it; and the members of the Jewish body generally have at all times given it their support.   The change from so crowded a locality as Mile End to the present eligible site of the hospital has, doubtless, proved advantageous to the institution, and to the Jewish community generally.   The edifice, which is constructed of brick with stone dressings, is a good specimen of the Jacobean style of architecture. Over the hall, &amp;c., is a synagogue, with a gallery, having an open timber roof. 
   <P>The schools of the Westmoreland Society, for children of parents residing within <num value="75">seventy-five</num> miles of London, are at Lower Norwood. Close by, on the slopes of a gentle hill, and occupying some <num value="40">forty</num> acres of ground, is Norwood South Metropolitan Cemetery.   It was <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest of our great metropolitan cemeteries, having been founded in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>. The grounds are well laid out, and command good views across Sydenham, Penge, and   Beckenham.   The   cemetery   is becoming rapidly filled with monuments.   Many men of mark have their last resting-place here: among them   Justice Talfourd, Douglas Jerrold, Angus Reach, Laman Blanchard, Sir Wm. Cubitt (the celebrated engineer); Sharon Turner, the historian; Sir Wm. Napier, the historian of the Peninsular War; James Wm. Gilbart, the founder of the London and Westminster Bank; and Frederick Robson, the comedian. 
   <P>In Upper Norwood is the Royal Normal College and Academy of Music for the Blind, which was established in <datestruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>, to afford a thorough general and musical education to the youthful blind of both sexes, who possess the requisite talent so as to qualify them for self-maintenance. The founders of the college, recognising that all of the different kinds of handicraft suitable for the blind were thoroughly taught in various establishment throughout the country, have confined themselves to the special work of preparing the blind as teachers, organists, and pianoforte tuners. The college is designed to form a supplement to the other institutions, and in no sense is it expected that it will take the place of the older establishments, or in any way interfere with their work.   The college embraces <num value="3">three</num> distinct departments- that of general education, of music, and pianoforte tuning. Each has been carefully planned, furnished with the most modern appliances, and provided with experienced teachers especially adapted to their part of the work. 
   <P>At Norwood, in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, died the Earl of Dudley, having been insane for the last.few months of his life. He had always been eccentric; but in the early part of <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct> he was declared by Sir Henry Halford to be insane, having committed a variety of harmless extravagances; and his last days were passed in retirement. 
   <P>On the southern side of Norwood, and extending about a mile and a half along the Brighton road from Brixton Hill towards Croydon, is the village of Streatham, about which we must write somewhat briefly, as we must not travel too far afield from the metropolis. It is a large, rambling district, occupying for the most part high ground, with a good deal of open heath still unenclosed. It abounds in mansions encompassed by wellwooded grounds. 
   <P>At the time of the Domesday survey Streatham was divided into several manors, the chief of which, called Totinges, which included the hamlet of Tooting, was held by the Abbot of St. Mary de Bec, and hence came to be known as Tooting- Bec.   From that period till the time of the <QUOTE>dissolution</QUOTE> of religious houses, it changed ownership on several occasions.   In <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct> it was sold to John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, and half a century later it was purchased by Sir Giles Howland. Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of John Howland, conveyed the property, by marriage, in <datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>, to Wriothesley, Marquis of Tavistock, afterwards <num value="3">third</num> Duke of Bedford, and Baron Howland of Streatham. The marriage   ceremony   was performed by Bishop Burnet, at Streatham   House, Lord Wriothesley <pb id="P.317" n="317"> being only <num value="15">fifteen</num> years old. Francis, <num value="5">fifth</num> Duke of Bedford, conveyed the mansion to his brother, Lord William Russell, who was murdered by his Swiss valet, Courvoisier.<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="375">375</num>.</NOTE>  Lord William made the old house his residence, but about the close of the last century conveyed it to the Earl of Coventry, by whom   it was pulled down, a more modern mansion being erected in its place. 
    <P>There are at Streatham mineral springs which, as Aubrey informs us, were discovered about <num value="14">fourteen</num> years before he wrote (A.D. <datestruct value="1659"><year reg="1659">1659</year></datestruct>). They were <num value="1">first</num> noticed in consequence of the ground giving way while the horses were ploughing in the field where they were situated. Persons afterwards employed in weeding in dry weather, it appears, drank some of the water, and found it purgative.  The owner of the field at <num value="1">first</num> forbade people to take the water; but before the end of the reign of  Charles II. it came into common use.   Lysons says that in his time (<datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>) the Streatham water was sent in large quantities to some of the London hospitals. The well still exists, but its fame has departed. 
    <P>On the high   road   between   the villages of Streatham   and Tooting, somewhat less than   a century ago, stood a turnpike gate, which was the scene of an amusing escapade, arising out of the convivial habits of Lord Thurlow. The   Lord Chancellor had been dining with Mr. Jenkinson (afterwards Lord Liverpool) at Addiscombe, his seat near Croydon, together with Dundas, and the younger Pitt, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. On their return late in the evening on horseback, they found the gate open, and as they had no servant with them, and were all more or less <QUOTE>merry</QUOTE> with wine, they rode through without staying to pay the toll.   The gatekeeper, aroused by the sound of their horse-hoofs as they galloped through, sprang up, rushed out into the road, and fired a blunderbuss after them, but fortunately without effect. He took them, no doubt, for a gang of highwaymen who had been committing robberies along the road. The story got about, much to the amusement of the <hi rend=italics>quidnuncs</hi> of <QUOTE>Brooks's</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>White's</QUOTE> clubs; and it was afterwards celebrated in the <QUOTE>Rolliad,</QUOTE> the author of which poem writes, alluding to Pitt- 
     <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>How, as he wandered darkling o&lsquo;er the plain, 
        <L>His reason drowned in Jenkinson's champagne, 
        <L>A rustic's hand, but righteous fate withstood, 
        <L>Had shed a Premier's for a robber's blood.</QUOTE>

   <P>But Streatham, perhaps, has chiefly deri-ed its celebrity from Dr. Johnson's connection with it.  Streatham Place was the residence of Henry Thrale, the opulent brewer of Southwark, to whom   we have already introduced the reader,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="34">34</num>.</NOTE> when Johnson was <num value="1">first</num> presented to him by his friend Murphy, in <datestruct value="1764--"><year reg="1764">1764</year></datestruct>; and during Thrale's life Streatham Place was to Johnson a <num value="2">second</num> home. Johnson did not become an inmate or constant guest at Mr. Thrale's house here till about <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct>, when his constitution seemed to be giving way, and he was visited by fits of deep and gloomy melancholy, which Mrs.  Thrale (afterwards Mrs. Piozzi), with her wonted vivacity and cheerfulness, did her best to dispel.  An apartment was fitted up for him; a knife and fork were constantly laid for him; companions and friends were invited from London without stint, to entertain him and to be entertained by him.  His favourite strolling-place in the grounds was known as Dr. Johnson's Walk. The summer-house in the garden was <num value="1">one</num> of the doctor's favourite resorts, when on a visit to his kind and hospitable friends. Here he made many pious meditations and resolutions; among the latter may be mentioned <num value="1">one</num> which still exists in his own handwriting, dated as late as <datestruct value="1781"><year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>To pass <num value="8">eight</num> hours every day in some serious employment.</QUOTE> 
   <P>As Mrs. Piozzi herself tells us, in her <QUOTE>Johnsoniana,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Dr. Johnson would here spend the middle days of the week, returning to his household near Fleet Street every Saturday, to give them <num value="3">three</num> good dinners and his company, before he came back to us on the Monday night,</QUOTE> thus reversing the process of our own day, which usually takes hard-working people into the suburbs from Saturday till Monday. In the drawing-room   at Streatham he revelled in the freedom of his discourse, released, as he doubtless felt himself, from the restraints of the clubs and coffee-houses of Covent Garden. It was here, for instance, that, when asked somewhat abruptly by a silly young fellow, whether he would recommend him to marry, he set him down with the quick reply, <QUOTE>Sir, I would advise no man to marry who is not likely to propagate understanding.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Of Mrs. Piozzi (Mrs. Thrale), whose name is destined always to shine in the world of literature as a <QUOTE>queen of society,</QUOTE> we have already spoken at some length in the chapter above referred to; but a few words more about her may not be out of place here. <QUOTE>Mrs. Thrale always appeared to me,</QUOTE> writes Sir N. W. Wraxall, in his <QUOTE>Historical Memoirs,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>to possess at least as much information and a mind as cultivated as Mrs. Montagu, and even more wit; but she did not descend among men from such an eminence, and she talked much <pb id="P.318" n="318"> more, as well as more unguardedly, upon every subject. She was the provider and conductress of Dr. Johnson, who lived almost entirely under her roof, .        .    . both in town and at Streatham. He did not, however, spare her more than other women in his attacks, if she courted or provoked his animadversion.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>I cannot withhold from Mrs. Thrale,</QUOTE> says Dr. Johnson, <QUOTE>the praise of being the author of that admirable poem, <title>The <num value="3">Three</num> Warnings</title>.</QUOTE> The long and constant hospitality of Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, at their house at Streatham, to Dr. Johnson, extended over almost the last <num value="20">twenty</num> years of his life. 
   <P>Miss Thrale, Johnson's <QUOTE>Queeny,</QUOTE> was among those who sat by the learned doctor's death-bed, in spite of the differences which had arisen between him and her mother, on account of her <num value="2">second</num> marriage.   Baretti, who acted for about <num value="10">ten</num> years as teacher of Italian to the daughters of Mrs. Thrale, on the recommendation of Dr. Johnson, afterwards assailed that lady's memory most ungratefully. 
    <P>Hung up in the library at Mrs. Piozzi's house was a series of portraits of literary characters, painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds, including those 
<FIGURE id="Fig.318" n="2000.14.0117"><HEAD>Lord Thurlovw's House, Knight's Hill.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 of Garrick, Goldsmith, Dr. C. Burney, Edmund Burke, Lord Lyttelton, Mrs. Piozzi herself and her daughter, and, of course, Dr. Johnson. This gallery of portraits was sold in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, when they fetched various prices, ranging from <measure value="80l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="80">80</num></measure> up to <measure value="378l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="378">378</num></measure>, at which price the burly doctor himself was knocked down.   They would easily fetch <num value="4">four</num> times that price now-a-days. An odd volume of <QUOTE>Saurin on the Bible,</QUOTE> with a memorandum   by Dr. Johnson on the title-page, and some manuscript notes by Mrs. Piozzi, fetched no less than <measure value="42l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="42">42</num></measure> in a sale of Mrs. Piozzi's effects at Brighton, in <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>. The teapot which used to stand on Mrs. Piozzi's table, and from which Dr. Johnson drank never-ending cups of the cheering liquid, was bought at the same time by Mrs. Marryatt. It held more than <num value="3">three</num> quarts, and was of Oriental porcelain, painted and gilt. 
   <P>Before closing this chapter, we may state that about the year <datestruct value="1870"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct> the Magdalen Hospital was removed hither from   Blackfriars Road, where it had existed as <num value="1">one</num> of the best-known charitable institutions in London for upwards of a century. We shall have more to say about it when we reach Blackfriars Road on our return journey. <pb id="P.319" n="319">

<P>Leaving Streatham Park on our left, we now make our way northward, by way of Streatham Hill and Tulse Hill, to Brixton. The Royal Asylum of St. Ann's Society, which we pass on our right, was founded in <datestruct value="1702--"><year reg="1702">1702</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>for the education and support of the daughters of persons once in prosperity, whether orphans or not.</QUOTE> The institution is pleasantly situated upon Streatham Hill, and flourishes under royal patronage. The schools, in which are taught, on an average, about <num value="400">400</num> children, are examined by the Syndicate of Cambridge, and the pupils are prepared for the Oxford and Cambridge local examinations. The asylum, erected in <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, is a handsome building of <num value="3">three</num> storeys, having an Ionic portico and pediment, ornamented by a sculpture of the royal arms, 
   <P>Almost on the summit of Brixton Hill, in <num value="1">one</num> of the most open and salubrious spots in the southern suburbs of London, stands what was till recently <num value="1">one</num> of the <LEMMA id="lemma.320.1">metropolitan houses of correction</LEMMA> for the county of Surrey; the other, Horsemonger Lane Gaol, we have already described.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi> p. <num value="253">253</num>.</NOTE>   Like nearly all the prisons constructed at the close of the last or beginning of the present century, this is planned in the form of a rude crescent, the governor's house being in the common centre. The prison was built in <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>, being calculated for <num value="185">185</num> prisoners, and no more: that is, there are (or were) <num value="149">149</num> separate cells, and <num value="12">twelve</num> double cells, in each of which, however, <num value="3">three</num> bed-racks were <pb id="P.320" n="320"> fitted up, making altogether bed-racks for <num value="185">185</num>. This number of inmates, however, was often considerably more than doubled; and hence it became unhealthy, in spite of its admirable situation, and long enjoyed the reputation of being very disorderly.   Mr. Hepworth Dixon, in his work on the <QUOTE>London Prisons,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>, writes: <QUOTE>Any person who knows aught of the working of a gaol system   will at once understand why the Brixton House of Correction is disorderly, why it is dirty, and why it is unhealthy, when we say that, instead of <num value="185">185</num> piisoners-its full complementthere are within its walls not less than <num value="431">431</num>. The daily average for <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct> was not less than <num value="382">382</num>, more than double the number for which there is any accommodation.</QUOTE> 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.320.2">Skits at Brixton Prison</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>Here the tread-wheel was <num value="1">first</num> employed, about the year <datestruct value="1824"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>; and from that period, down to the time when it ceased to be used as a house of correction, this prison was, <hi rend=italics>par excellence</hi>, <num value="1">one</num> for hard labour; in fact, it was all tread-wheel, except for the females, who were employed in picking oakum and sewing. 
   <P>In former times the external appearance of this prison had anything but a show of security against the escape of prisoners, the boundary-wall being much too low. <QUOTE>More than <num value="1">one</num> person,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Dixon, at the date above mentioned, <QUOTE>has been known to leap from the top without being at all hurt; it is, in fact, so low as to offer a pressing temptation to escape; and attempts are, therefore, not unfrequent, sometimes,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>as in a recent case, with most disastrous consequences.   A   man had got on the wall with the design of regaining his freedom: he was observed, and chased   by the officers and   governor.   A quantity of bricks (loose) are placed on the wall to increase its height, and these furnished the man with defensive weapons, by which he was enabled to keep his pursuers at bay. Seeing no other means of capturing him, <num value="1">one</num> of the officers (not the governor, as was stated in the newspapers at the time) fired at him and seriously wounded him. It was thought at <num value="1">first</num>, and so, reported, that the wretched man was killed, but, fortunately, it proved otherwise.</QUOTE> 
    <P>As may be inferred from what we have stated above, this prison was <num value="1">one</num> of the worst, in point of management, of any in the kingdom, and the, result was that it became a perfect scandal. Access to its precincts was very rarely, if ever, afforded to the outside world; and it is on record that members of Parliament, and even the Duke of Wellington, had been refused admission.   Some idea of its character, however, was afforded to the public in a pamphlet, entitled <QUOTE>A Month at Brixton Treadmill,</QUOTE> which was published a few years ago. But a change was in store, for the old prison was sold in <datestruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></datestruct> to Her Majesty's Government, by whom it has been converted into a convict establishment for females. 
   <P>Westward of the prison, and stretching away to Balham Hill Road, a large tract of land, some <num value="250">250</num> acres in extent, known as Bleak Hill, was, in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, taken by Mr. Thomas Cubitt, the builder of Belgravia, and converted into a series of broad roads and open spaces, planted, and built over with capacious detached villas, and named Clapham Park. This was long the <QUOTE>Belgravia of Clapham;</QUOTE> but a newer and perhaps more attractive quarter has since sprung up in <QUOTE>The Cedars,</QUOTE> which lies on the opposite side of Clapham Common. 
   <P>Clapham is supposed to have received its appellation from <num value="1">one</num> of its ancient proprietors, Osgod Clapa, being the name of the Danish lord at whose daughter's marriage-feast Hardicanute died. Mr. Brayley, in his <QUOTE>History of Surrey,</QUOTE> however, observes that there is an objection to this supposition, inasmuch as in the Chertsey Register the place is named <QUOTE>Clappenham</QUOTE> as far back as the reign of Alfred.   In the Domesday Survey it is entered as <QUOTE>Clopeham.</QUOTE> Hughson, in his <QUOTE>History of London</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>), describes Clapham as a village about <num value="4">four</num> miles from Westminster Bridge, and consisting of <QUOTE>many handsome houses, surrounding a common that commands many pleasing views. This common,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>about the commencement of the present reign, was little better than a morass, and the roads were almost impassable. The latter are now in an excellent state, and the common so beautifully planted with trees, that it has the appearance of a park. These improvements were effected by a subscription of the inhabitants, who, on this occasion, have been much indebted to the taste and exertions of Mr. Christopher Baldwin, for many years an inhabitant, and an active magistrate; and as a proof of the consequent increased value of property on this spot, Mr. Baldwin has sold <num value="14">fourteen</num> acres of land near his own house for <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure>.   . . . A reservoir near the Wandsworth Road supplies the village with water.</QUOTE> The Common, .still about <num value="220">220</num> acres in extent, is bounded on the eastern side by Balham Hill Road, which is a continuation of the road through Newington which we have already described; on the north-west by Battersea Rise; and on the south-west by a roadway, dotted at intervals with private residences standing within their own grounds, and <QUOTE>embosomed high in tufted trees.</QUOTE> Like Peckham Rye, and such other open <pb id="P.321" n="321"> spaces of the kind as are left in the suburbs of London, Clapham   Common in its time has had its fair share of patronage, either of those who delight in the healthful and invigorating game of cricket, or of those who desire a quiet stroll over its velvet-like turf. Pleasure-fairs, too, were held here on Good Friday, Easter and Whit Mondays, and   on <QUOTE>Derby Day;</QUOTE> but these were abolished in <datestruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct>. The Common is ornamented with a few large ponds, which add not a little to the charm of the place. 
   <P>In the year <datestruct value="1874"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct> the Enclosure Commissioners for England and Wales, under the Metropolitan Commons' Act, <datestruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>, and Metropolitan Commons' Amendment Act, <datestruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct>, certified a scheme for placing the Common under the control of the Local Board. The Common was purchased for the sum of <measure value="17000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="17000">17,000</num></measure>, and it was proposed that it should be dedicated to the use and recreation of the public for ever.   By the above-mentioned scheme the Board were to drain, plant, and ornament the Common as necessary, but no houses were to be built thereon, except lodges necessary for its maintenance.   The   Metropolitan   Board   of Works having thus taken the Common under their protection, at once set to work in order to effect an improvement in its appearance, by the planting of an avenue of young trees, and the formation of new footpaths in an ornamental style. The Board also issued its mandate that no more gravel was to be dug, or turf or furze cut off the Common, and that nothing should be done to disturb its rural aspect. To this day, consequently, <QUOTE>the Common</QUOTE> is, perhaps, <num value="1">one</num> of the least changed of all spots round London, that is, so far as encroachment goes. 
    <P>In a house a few doors from   the <QUOTE>Plough</QUOTE> Inn, and facing the Common (now occupied by a fishmonger), Thomas Babington Macaulay spent the greater portion of his childhood, caring less for his toys than for books, which he read well at <num value="3">three</num> years' old!   Here Hannah More visited the Macaulays, and, the parents being absent, was horrified at being offered a glass of spirits by the precocious child, who had learned the existence of spirits from the pages of Robinson Crusoe!  The Common, at that time, had something poetic about it, at all events, to the imaginative mind of the future historian. <QUOTE>That delightful wilderness of gorse-bushes, and poplar-groves and gravel-pits, and ponds great and small, was to little Tom  Macaulay a region of inexhaustible romance and mystery.   He explored all its recesses; he composed, and almost believed, its legends;</QUOTE> and his biographer, Mr. G. O. Trevelyan, records the fact that he would trace out in the hillocks of the  Common an imaginary set of Alps, and an equally fanciful range of Mount Sinai. The house formerly stood back from the road, but of late years it has thrown out a shop-front, and, externally, has lost all traces of having been a private gentleman's residence.   Lady Trevelyan, a sister of Lord  Macaulay, lived for a time at Clapham, after breaking up her <hi rend=italics>menage</hi> in Great George Street. 
    <P>The <QUOTE>Clapham   Sect,</QUOTE> on whose merits a brilliant panegyric was penned by Sir James Stephen, had its head-quarters at this house, and at that of  Lord Teignmouth's, close by. The virtues of the <QUOTE>Claphamites,</QUOTE> as they were sneeringly called, have been acknowledged even by their most strenuous opponents. 
    <P>The old Manor House, which was standing at the corner of Manor Street when Priscilla Wakefield wrote her <QUOTE>Perambulations,</QUOTE> in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, and was then occupied as a ladies' school, was distinguished by a singular tower, octagonal in form. 
    <P>Skirting the Common, particularly on the eastern side, are still standing several of the spacious old red-brick mansions, the abode of wealthy London merchants, which once nearly surrounded its entire area.   Many have fine elms growing in the grounds before them. The place must have been well inhabited, even so far back as John Evelyn's time, for he mentions dining here, at the house of  Sir Dennis Gauden, whom he accompanied thence to Windsor on business with the king.   Perhaps he was a City magnate, willing to lend money to his ever impecunious sovereign. The house, which was a large roomy edifice, with a noble gallery occupying the whole length of the building, was built by Sir Dennis for his brother, Dr. John Gauden,  Bishop of Exeter, the presumed author of <QUOTE>Eikon  Basilike ;</QUOTE> and after his death, in <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, it became the residence of Sir Dennis himself, who sold it to <num value="1">one</num> <QUOTE>Will</QUOTE> Hewer, who rose from being Pepys' clerk to a high position in the civil service, but found his occupation gone at the Revolution. Sir  Dennis still, however, lived here, <QUOTE>very handsomely, and friendly to everybody,</QUOTE> writes Evelyn, who was often a guest at his table; and he died here a few months after the fall of the Stuarts. 
    <P>Pepys used often to visit here his friend Gauden, <QUOTE>Victualler of the Navy, afterwards Sheriff of   London, and a knight.</QUOTE> Under date <datestruct VALUE="1663-07-25"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=25>25</day>, <year reg=1663>1663</year></datestruct>, he writes, in his <QUOTE>Diary:</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>Having intended this day to go to Banstead Downes to see a famous race, I sent Will to get himself ready to go with me; but I hear it is put off, because the Lords do sit in Parliament to-day. After some debate, Creed Iand I resolved to go to Clapham, to Mr. Gauden's. <pb id="P.322" n="322"> When I come there, the <num value="1">first</num> thing was to show me his house, which is almost built. I find it very regular and finely contrived, and the gardens and offices about it as convenient and as full of good variety as ever I saw in my life. It is true he hath been censured for laying out so much money; but he tells me he built it for his brother, who is since dead (the bishop), who, when he should come to be Bishop of Winchester, which he was promised (to which bishopricke, at present, there is no house), he did intend to dwell here. By and by to dinner, and in comes Mr. Creed; I saluted his lady and the young ladies, and his sister, the bishop's widow, who was, it seems, Sir W. Russell's daughter, the Treasurer of the Navy, whom   I find to be very well bred, and a woman of excellent discourse. Towards the evening we bade them   adieu, and took horse, being resolved that, instead of the race which fails us, we would go to Epsom.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Later on, it seems, Pepys took up his residence here with his friend Hewer. John Evelyn writes again in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date <datestruct VALUE="1700-09-23"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=23>23rd</day>, <year reg=1700>1700</year></datestruct>: <QUOTE>I went to visit Mr. Pepys, at Clapham, where he has a very noble and wonderfully well-furnished house, especially with Indian and Chinese curiosities: the offices and gardens well accommodated for pleasure and retirement.</QUOTE> <num value="3">Three</num> years later, namely, on the <datestruct VALUE="1703-05-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct>, Evelyn made the following entry in his <QUOTE>Diary:</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>This day died Mr. Sam. Pepys, a very worthy, industrious, and curious person, none in England exceeding him in knowledge of the Navy, in which he had passed thro&lsquo; all the most considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty, all of which he performed with greate integrity. When K. James II. went out of England, he laid down his office and would serve no more, but withdrawing himselfe from all public affaires, he liv'd at Clapham with his partner, Mr. Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and sweete place, where he enjoy'd the fruite of his labours in greate prosperity.   He was universally belov'd, hospitable, generous, learned in many things, skill'd in music, a very greate cherisher of learned men of whom he had the conversation.   His library and collection of other curiosities were of the most considerable, the models of ships especially.</QUOTE> He was buried, as already stated, in St. Olave's Church, Hart Street.<NOTE>See Vol. II., p. <num value="112">112</num>.</NOTE>

   <P>Lord Braybrooke, in his <title>Memoir of Samuel Pepys</title>, tells us that when he removed to Mr. Hewer's house at Clapham, he left a large portion of his correspondence behind him in York Buildings, in the custody of a friend. This correspondence eventually found its way into the Bodleian Library, at Oxford. It only remains to add that Hewer's house was pulled down about the middle of the last century. 
   <P>In a large house on the east side of the Common, at the corner of what is now known as Cavendish Road, lived Mr. Henry Cavendish, the eccentric chemist, of whom we have already had occasion to speak, in our notice of Gower Street.<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="568">568</num>.</NOTE>   He died in <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, leaving more than a million to be divided among his relatives. <num value="1">One</num> of his eccentricities was his utter disregard of money. The bankers with whom he kept his account finding that his balance had accumulated to upwards of <measure value="80000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="80000">80,000</num></measure>, commissioned <num value="1">one</num> of the partners to wait on him, and to ask him what he wished done with it. On reaching Clapham, and finding Mr. Cavendish's house, he rang the bell, but had the greatest difficulty in obtaining admission. <QUOTE>You must wait,</QUOTE> said the servant, <QUOTE>till my master rings his bell, and then I will let him know that you are here.</QUOTE> In about a quarter of an hour the bell rang, and the fact of the banker's arrival was duly communicated to the abstracted chemist. Mr. Cavendish, in great agitation, desired that the banker might be shown up, and as he entered the room, saluted him with a few words, asking him the object of his visit. <QUOTE>Sir, I thought proper to wait upon you, as we have in hand a very large balance of yours, and we wish for your orders respecting it.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Oh, if it is any trouble to you, I will take it out of your hands. Do not come here to plague me about money.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>It is not the least trouble to us, sir; but we thought you might like some of it turned to account, and invested.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Well, well; what do you want to do?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Perhaps you would like to have <measure value="40000l." type=currency><num value="40000">forty thousand</num> pounds</measure> invested?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Yes; do so, if you like; but don't come here to trouble me any more, or I will remove my balance.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Cavendish lived a very retired existence, and to strangers he was most reserved.   To   such an extent did he carry his solitary habits, that he would never even see or allow himself to be seen by a female servant; and, as Lord Brougham relates, <QUOTE>he used to order his dinner daily by a note, which he left at a certain hour on the hall table, whence the housekeeper was to take it.</QUOTE> 
   <P>His shyness was, not unnaturally, mistaken by strangers for pride.   In Bruhn's <QUOTE>Life of Von Humboldt</QUOTE> it is related that, <QUOTE>While travelling in England, in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, with George Forster, Humboldt obtained permission to make use of the <pb id="P.323" n="323"> library of the eminent chemist and philosopher, Henry Cavendish, <num value="2">second</num> son of the Duke of Devonshire, on condition, however, that he was on no account to presume so far as to speak to or even greet the shy and aristocratic owner, should he happen to encounter him.   Humboldt states this in a letter to Bunsen, adding, sarcastically,  <Q>Cavendish little suspected, at that time, that it was I who, in <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, was to be his successor at the Academy of Sciences.</Q> </QUOTE> 
   <P>Cavendish, who has been styled <QUOTE>the Newton of Chemistry,</QUOTE> was distinguished as the founder of pneumatic chemistry, and for his successful researches on the composition of water, and his famous experiment, made at Clapham, for the determination of the earth's density. <QUOTE>The man who weighed the world,</QUOTE> wrote his cousin, the late Duke of Devonshire, in his <QUOTE>Handbook for  Chatsworth,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>buried his science and his wealth in solitude and insignificance at Clapham.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Almost the whole of his house here was occupied as workshops and laboratory. <QUOTE>It was stuck about with thermometers, rain-gauges, &amp;c. A registering thermometer of Cavendish's own   construction served as a sort of landmark to his house. It is now in Professor Brande's possession.</QUOTE> A small portion only of the villa was set apart for personal comfort. The upper rooms constituted an astronomical observatory. What is now the drawingroom was the laboratory. In an adjoining room a forge was placed. The lawn was invaded by a wooden stage, from which access could be had to a large tree, to the top of which Cavendish, in the course of his astronomical, meteorological, electrical, or other researches, occasionally ascended. His library was immense, and he fixed it at a distance from his house, in order that he might not be disturbed by those who came to consult it. His own particular friends were allowed to borrow books, but neither they nor even Mr. Cavendish himself ever withdrew a book without giving a receipt for it. The mansion of Henry Cavendish, since re-fronted and considerably altered, was in <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct> the residence of Mr. H. S. Bicknell, and is known as Cavendish House. 
   <P>Here and at Balham, towards the close of the last century, were many residents who belonged to the Wesleyan connexion; and it was at a friend's house at Balham that John Wesley dined and slept less than a week before his death, in <datestruct VALUE="1791-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>The famous beauty, Mrs. Baldwin-who, when young, turned the head of the Prince of Wales, had her portrait painted and her bust sculptured far foreign emperors and kings, and was kissed publicly by Dr. Johnson, whom she used to meet at Mrs. Thrale's house at Streatham-lived for many years at Clapham, and died here in <datestruct VALUE="1839-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>The house known as Broomfield, on the south. west side of the Common, was occupied for some years by Mr. William Wilberforce, M.P., the distinguished philanthropist; and there his no less distinguished son, Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop successively of Oxford and of Winchester, was born, on the <datestruct VALUE="1805-09-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>Close by stood the house once occupied by Henry Thornton, the author and prime mover of the agitation for the <QUOTE>reformation of manners and the suppression of slavery,</QUOTE> in which William Wilberforce took such a distinguished part. The conclave, we are told, held their meetings, for the most part, in an oval saloon which William Pitt planned to be added to Thornton's residence. <QUOTE>It arose at his bidding,</QUOTE> writes Sir J. Stephen, in his <QUOTE>Essays,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>and yet remains, perhaps a solitary monument of the architectural skill of that imperial mind. Lofty and symmetrical, it was curiously wainscoted with books on every side, except where it opened on a far extended lawn, reposing beneath the giant arms of aged elms and massive tulip-trees.</QUOTE> <NOTE>Quoted by Mr. J. Thorn in his <QUOTE>Environs of London.</QUOTE> </NOTE>

   <P>In Mr. J. T. Smith's <QUOTE>Book for a Rainy Day,</QUOTE> we are introduced to <num value="1">one</num> of these old-fashioned mansions:-- <QUOTE>On arriving at Mr. Esdaile's gate,</QUOTE> he tells us, <QUOTE>Mr. Smedley remarked that this (Clapham) was <num value="1">one</num> of the few   commons near London which had not been enclosed. The house had <num value="1">one</num> of those plain fronts which indicated little, but upon ascending the steps I was struck with a similar sensation to those of the previous season, when <num value="1">first</num> I entered this hospitable mansion. If I were to suffer myself to utter anything like an ungrateful remark, it would be that the visitor, immediately he enters the hall, is presented with too much at once, for he knows not which to admire <num value="1">first</num>, the choice display of pictures which decorate the hall, or the equally artful and delightful manner in which the park-like grounds so luxuriantly burst upon his sight.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The parish church, built on the north-western corner of the Common, is a dull, heavy building, a sort of cross between the London parish church of Queen Anne's time and the <QUOTE>chapel of ease</QUOTE> of the last century. It dates from the year <datestruct value="1776"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct>. Yet Macaulay was fond of it to the last. He writes, under date Clapham, <datestruct VALUE="1849-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>: <QUOTE>To church this morning. I love the church, for the sake of old times; I love even that absurd painted window, with the dove, the lamb, the urn, the <num value="2">two</num> cornucopias, and the profusion of sun-flowers, <pb id="P.324" n="324"> passionflowers, and peonies.</QUOTE> He adds, <QUOTE>I heard a Puseyite sermon, very different from the oratory which I formerly used to hear from   the same pulpit.</QUOTE> The edifice is an ugly brick structure, with a singular dome-crowned tower at the west end. It contains a mural tablet to the memory of Dr. John Jebb, <QUOTE>the good, great, and pious Bishop of Limerick,</QUOTE> who died in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>; also a monument, by Sir Richard Westmacott, to John Thornton.   The remains of the bishop are depo sited in the tomb of the Thorntons. 
   <P>Priscilla Wakefield, in her <QUOTE>Perambulations of London,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, writes as follows:-- <QUOTE>There are now no remains of the old church, except the south aisle, which does not bear the marks of any remote antiquity. It is now out of use, unless for the funeral service, there being no other burying-ground but that which belongs to it. The new church stands on the north side of the Common; it is a plain modern edifice, without aisles or chancel.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Mr. J. T. Smith, the antiquary, states that the walls of the little old parish church, which was demolished to make way for its successor, were adorned with Scripture texts, painted in accordance 
<FIGURE id="Fig.324" n="2000.14.0119"><HEAD>View   Of Clapham   In <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 with the instructions of Queen Elizabeth. The old church, however, stood at some little distance from the present parish church, on the high ground between Larkhall Lane and Wandsworth Road. St. Paul's Church, which occupies its site, is a plain brick-built structure, and was erected in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>. On the south wall is a monument, with bust, of William Hewer, which was saved on the demolition of the old church. 
   <P>St. John's Church, built in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>, stands on the western side of the Clapham Road, between Stockwell and the Common; it is after the model of a Greek temple, with an Ionic portico and no steeple, but a cross on the top of the pediment. Dr. Bickersteth, Bishop of Ripon, was for some years the officiating minister here. 
   <P>St. Saviour's Church, in Cedars' Road, is a large and handsome cruciform structure, with a central tower in <num value="3">three</num> stages, with pinnacles. It is in the Decorated style of architecture, and was built, in <datestruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct>, from the designs of Mr. J. Knowles, at the cost of the Rev. W. Bowyer.   The windows are filled with painted glass, by Clayton and Bell. This church remained unconsecrated for several years, in consequence of the bishop of the diocese <pb id="P.325" n="325"> objecting to the position of a monument of Mrs. Bowyer, which had been placed under the tower, immediately in front of the altar-rails. The monument--an altar-tomb, with a recumbent effigy of Mrs. Bowyer--was removed, in <datestruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct>, to the north transept. 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.325.1">View from Mr. Akerman's House, Clapham Common</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>By far the finest ecclesiastical-looking structures at Clapham   do not belong to the Established Church. These are the Congregational Chapel, in Grafton Square, built in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, <num value="1">one</num> of the most commodious and elegant edifices of which London Nonconformists can boast; and the Roman Catholic Redemptorist Church of St. Mary, built in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>. These, with their lofty spires, quite dwarf the plain and unpretending parish structures. 
    <P>Mr. G. O. Trevelyan writes thus, in his <QUOTE>Life of Lord Macaulay :</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>At Clapham, as elsewhere, the old order is changing. What was once the home of Zachary stands almost within the swing of the bells of a stately and elegant Roman Catholic chapel; and the pleasant mansion of Lord Teignmouth, the cradle of the Bible Society, is now turned into a convent of monks</QUOTE> --he should have said, of <QUOTE>regular</QUOTE> clergy.   A gentleman who lived close by, in <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>, brought an action

De Weld</QUOTE> must be regarded as settling the question as to the right of any clergyman except <num value="1">one</num> of the Established Church to ring bells to the annoyance of his neighbours. 
   <P>The pulpit of Clapham   Church, in Macaulay's childhood, it is almost needless to add, rang with <QUOTE>Evangelical</QUOTE> doctrines.   Indeed, Clapham has long been regarded as a suburb whose residents are chiefly distinguished by social prosperity and ardent attachment to <QUOTE>Evangelical opinions ;</QUOTE> and hence it is sneeringly spoken of by <QUOTE>Tom Ingoldsby</QUOTE> as <QUOTE>that sanctified ville;</QUOTE> and Thackeray has introduced a picture of the religious life of the place into the opening chapters of <QUOTE>The Newcomes,</QUOTE> though he has, perhaps, overdrawn the Nonconformist element in it, and <QUOTE>Hobson</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>Brian Newcome</QUOTE> are scarcely fair specimens of the outcome of the religious influences of <QUOTE>the Clapham Sect</QUOTE> in its palmy days, when it numbered Wilberforce, and James Stephen, the Thorntons, and Charles and Robert Grant. Still, it was the chosen home of the Low-Church party during its golden age. <pb id="P.326" n="326"> and Churchmen and Nonconformists met there on common ground. 
   <P>The meetings of Henry Drummond, the elder Macaulay, and the little coterie that gathered round them, and who were designated the <QUOTE>Clapham Sect,</QUOTE> <num value="1">first</num> made the ancient home of Osgod Clapa a synonym for devout respectability, and doubtless it will be long before this distinctive description will die out. As Horace writes- 
                       <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L part=f>The cask will long 
          <L>Retain the sweet scents of its earliest days.</QUOTE>
 
   <P>When the <QUOTE>Clapham Sect</QUOTE> <num value="1">first</num> became famous, even along the high road the houses had not crept along in an unbroken line to the Common; the place was literally a village, prim, select, and exclusive. For several generations Nonconformity had had a foothold therein. It is said that between the years <datestruct value="1640--"><year reg=1640>1640</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1650--"><year reg=1650>1650</year></datestruct> Mr. William Bridge, M.A., <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="5">five</num> divines who, under the leadership of Philip Nye, made a stand for liberty of conscience in the Westminster Assembly of Divines, preached at Clapham, and founded therein   an Independent congregation. Be that as it may, it is certain that when Charles II. published, in <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>-<num value="72">72</num>, a declaration of Indulgence, licenses to conduct Nonconformist worship were granted to Dr. Wilkinson, of Clapham, for his own house and school-room, and to Mr. Thomas Lye, of the same place, for his own house.   Mr. Lye had been minister of Allhallows, and <num value="1">one</num> of Cromwell's Triers. He formed a congregation, which continued to assemble in a private house in the time of his successor, Philip Lamb. Subsequently it met in a temporary wooden building, and in <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct> a more substantial edifice was erected, in which for some years laboured Dr. Furneaux, a learned and voluminous writer, with a strong leaning towards Arianism. In this chapel they continued to meet until, in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, was erected Grafton Square Chapel.   The congregation is large and comparatively wealthy. A commodious lecture-hall, used also as a Sundayschool, is erected in the immediate vicinity of the church, and a mission-hall and schools in the Wandsworth Road. 
   <P>The <QUOTE>Clapham   Sect</QUOTE> --which comprised the leaders of the Evangelical party, mostly Churchmen, but with a sprinkling of Nonconformists, and numbered among them such men as Wilberforce, Zachary Macaulay, Thornton, Stephen, &amp;c.-met, as we have stated before, at Lord Teignmouth's house, at the corner of Clapham Common, now the Redemptorists' College and Monastery; and in this house the Bible Society was founded. <num value="1">One</num> of the <QUOTE>sect,</QUOTE> Mr. Henry Thornton, of Clapham, was said to have spent <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure> annually in the distribution of Bibles and other religious books. 
   <P>The practical influence of the <QUOTE>Clapham Sect</QUOTE> was great, though they had no posts or offices with which to bribe followers; they doubtless, also, did much to awaken society to a sense of the great importance of personal religion; but surely Macaulay is guilty of an exaggeration when he writes of them as follows : <QUOTE>The truth is that from that little knot of men emanated all the Bible societies and almost all the missionary societies in the world.   The share which they had,</QUOTE> he continues, <QUOTE>in providing means for the education of the people was great.   They were the real destroyers of the slave-trade and of slavery. Many of those whom   Stephen describes, in his article on the  <Q>Clapham   Sect,</Q>  were public men of the greatest weight. Lord Teignmouth governed India at Calcutta. Grant governed India in Leadenhall Street. Stephen's father was Perceval's right-hand man in the House of Commons. It is needless to speak of Wilberforce. As to Simeon, if you knew what his authority and influence were, you would allow that his real sway in the Church was far greater than that of any primate.</QUOTE> And such was really the case. At the beginning of this century, and for the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="30">thirty</num> years, the men who met at Lord Teignmouth's table here were really the life and soul of the Established Church, and the spring of its active energy. 
   <P>On the western side of the Common, in Nightingale Lane, a thoroughfare leading from Clapham to Wandsworth Common, lives the Rev. C. H. Spurgeon, of whom we have already spoken in our accounts of the Metropolitan Tabernacle and the Surrey Music Hall.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi> pp. <num value="29">29</num>, <num value="260">260</num>, <num value="267">267</num>.</NOTE>     <num value="1">One</num> of Mr. Spurgeon's <num value="1">first</num> undertakings, on settling in London, was the Pastors' College. The work of the college was for many years carried on in the dark subterranean rooms under the Tabernacle; but in <datestruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct> it was transferred to a more convenient, suitable, and commodious building at the rear of the Tabernacle, which had been erected and furnished at a cost of about <measure value="15000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="15000">15,000</num></measure>.   Here there is a fine hall, large class-rooms, a spacious library, and other conveniences. Of the work that has been done at the Pastors' College some idea may be formed from the following quotation of Mr. Spurgeon's account of the college, written in <datestruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct> :-- <QUOTE>There are now <num value="330">330</num> men proclaiming the Gospel in connection with the Baptist denomination who have been trained in the college, of whom <num value="2">two</num> are in India, <num value="1">one</num> in China, <num value="2">two</num> in Spain, <num value="1">one</num> in Rio Janeiro, <num value="1">one</num> in St. Helena, <pb id="P.327" n="327"> <num value="1">one</num> in Turk's Island, <num value="1">one</num> in South Africa, <num value="6">six</num> in Australia, <num value="23">twenty-three</num> in the United States, and <num value="10">ten</num> in the Canadian Dominion.</QUOTE> 
   <P>We now   make our way northward from   the Common   by the   Clapham   Road, leaving   the <QUOTE>Plough</QUOTE> Inn on our left. This sign, we need scarcely remark, leads the mind back to days when the village of Clapham, far removed from the busy hum   of London life, was surrounded by green fields and homesteads. <QUOTE>Among agricultural signs,</QUOTE> Mr. Larwood tells us, in his <QUOTE>History of Signboards,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>the  <Q>Plough</Q>  leads the van, sometimes accompanied by the legend,  <Q>Speed the Plough.</Q> </QUOTE> In some cases the sign bears an inscription in verse, such as-

<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.327.1">Girl's Orphanage, Stockwell, <datestruct value="1882--"><year reg="1882">1882</year></datestruct></LEMMA></NOTE>
 
<P>Stockwell lies to our right as we journey along the Clapham Road on our way back towards the metropolis. <QUOTE>The etymology of the place,</QUOTE> writes Allen, in his <QUOTE>History of Surrey,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>is probably derived from  <Q> stoke</Q>  (the Saxon <hi rend=italics>stoc</hi>, a wood), and  <Q>well,</Q>  from some spring in the neighbourhood.</QUOTE> It is called a <QUOTE>small rural village</QUOTE> by Priscilla Wakefield, in her <QUOTE>Perambulations of London,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>. The place, indeed, retained its characteristics of rustic retirement down to <pb id="P.328" n="328"> a comparatively recent date. In the <QUOTE>Chimney Corner Companion</QUOTE> is an amusing account of a cockney's <QUOTE>outing</QUOTE> with a gun on the <datestruct VALUE="1825-09-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, in which we are told how that he and his friend breakfasted at the <QUOTE>Swan</QUOTE> at Stockwell, and pushed on Kent-wards by way of Brixton to Blackheath, but <QUOTE>without meeting anything beyond yellow-hammers and sparrows!</QUOTE> 
    <P>Like Lee and other places in the immediate vicinity of London which we have visited in our perambulations, Stockwell once boasted of its <QUOTE>green;</QUOTE> but this, excepting in name, has already become a thing of the past, and bricks and mortar are fast usurping what little is left of its once shady lanes and hedgerows. It was a triangular space on the western side of the high road, nearly opposite the <QUOTE>Swan.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, as we learn from Colburn's <QUOTE>Kalendar of Amusements,</QUOTE> the society of Albion archers held their <num value="1">first</num> grand field-day, to contend for the captaincy and lieutenancy for the month, and  Stockwell Park was the place of rendezvous. We are naively told that <QUOTE>shooting commences at <num value="1">one</num>, eating and drinking at <num value="7">seven</num>, and the light fantastic toes are agitating at <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct> this place was alarmed by an apparition, known to this day as <QUOTE>the Stockwell Ghost,</QUOTE> which spread such terror through the then retired village and neighbourhood that it became suddenly invested with almost as much notoriety as Cock Lane<NOTE>See Vol. II., p. <num value="436">436</num>.</NOTE> some years previously. 
   <P>The story is thus told by Charles Mackay, in his <QUOTE>Extraordinary Popular Delusions:</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>Mrs. Golding, an elderly lady, who resided alone with her servant, Anne Robinson, was sorely surprised, on the evening of Twelfth Day, <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, to observe an extraordinary commotion among her crockery.   Cups and saucers rattled down the chimney; pots and pans were whirled downwards or through the windows; and hams, cheeses, and loaves of bread disported themselves upon the floor just as if the devil were in them. This, at least, was the conclusion to which Mrs. Golding came; and, being greatly alarmed, she invited some of her neighbours to stay with her, and protect her from the evil <num value="1">one</num>. Their presence, however, did not put a stop to the insurrection of china, and every room in the house was in a short time strewed with fragments.   The chairs and tables at last joined in the tumult; and things looked altogether so serious and inexplicable that the neighbours, dreading that the house itself would next be seized with a fit of motion and i tumble about their ears, left poor Mrs. Golding to bear the brunt of it by herself. The ghost in this case was solemnly remonstrated with, and urged to take its departure; but the destruction continuing as great as before, Mrs. Golding finally made up her mind to quit the house altogether. With Anne Robinson, she took   refuge in the house of a neighbour; but his glass and crockery being immediately subjected to the   same persecution, he was reluctantly compelled to give her notice to quit. The old lady, thus forced back to her own house, endured the disturbance for some days longer, when   suspecting that Anne Robinson was the cause of all the mischief, she dismissed her from her service. The extraordinary appearances immediately ceased, and were never afterwards renewed     a fact which is of itself sufficient to point out the real disturber. A long time afterwards Anne Robinson   confessed   the whole matter to the Rev. Mr. Brayfield. This gentleman confided the story to Mr. Hone, who published an   explanation   of the mystery.   It appears that Anne was anxious to have a clear house to carry on an intrigue with her lover, and she resorted to this trick in order to effect her purpose. She placed the china on the shelves in such a manner that it fell on the slightest motion; and she attached horse-hair to other articles, so that she could jerk them down from an adjoining room without being perceived by any <num value="1">one</num>. She was exceedingly dexterous at this sort of work, and would have proved a formidable rival to many a juggler by profession. A full explanation of the whole affair may be found in  <Q>Hone's Every-day Book.</Q> </QUOTE> The pranks of the <QUOTE>ghost</QUOTE> are also described so fully by Sir Walter Scott, in his book on <QUOTE>Demonology and Witchcraft,</QUOTE> that there is scarcely any necessity of repeating them more minutely here. 
   <P>The <QUOTE>little fairy green</QUOTE> before the <QUOTE>Swai,</QUOTE> at Stockwell, writes Mr. Thomas Miller, with poetic exaggeration, in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>is now no more.</QUOTE> It was a dead, flat, triangular space, with no fairies. 
   <P> <QUOTE>On the west side of Stockwell Green,</QUOTE> writes Allen, in his work above quoted, <QUOTE>is an old house, now (<datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>) in the occupation of a butcher, in which Mr. Nichols says that Thomas, Lord Cromwell, lived. There is no proof, however,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>that the above individual resided here or at the adjacent manor-house.</QUOTE> 
   <P>At the eastern end of London Road-or what was formerly called Bedford Private Road-and near the triangular space of ground which was once the <QUOTE>Green,</QUOTE> stands St. Andrew's Church. This edifice, originally known as Stockwell Chapel, <pb id="P.329" n="329"> 
<!--illustration on unnumbered page facing page <num value="329">329</num>-->

<FIGURE id="Fig.329" n="2000.14.0121"><HEAD>Front Of The Metropolitan Tabernacle.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 was in <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct> described as <QUOTE>a plain edifice of brick, with a small turret and bell.</QUOTE> The chapel was built about the year <datestruct value="1767"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>, on a piece of ground granted by the Duke of Bedford. In <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, and again in <datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>, it was enlarged and greatly altered, at a cost of <measure value="3400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3400">3,400</num></measure>; and on St. Barnabas Day in that year it was consecrated, under the title of St. Andrew. Soon afterwards a consolidated chapelry district, taken out of the new parishes of St. Mark, Kennington, and St. Matthew, Brixton, was assigned to the church. 
    <P>In the London Road is a small-pox and fever hospital, which was established here in <datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct> by the Metropolitan District Asylums Board. 
    <P>On the east side of Stockwell Road are the  Stockwell Training and Kindergarten Colleges and  Practising Schools, in connection with the British and Foreign School Society, whose head-quarters are in the Borough Road. The schools here, which are for girls, were erected about the year <datestruct value="1864"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct>, and have since been enlarged by the addition of a new wing. Accommodation is afforded here for <num value="135">135</num> girls and <num value="125">125</num> students.   The Kindergarten institution, as we learn from   the Report presented to the Society in <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>, had grown rapidly during the preceding year. <QUOTE>It is meant to be self-supporting, and, judging from present experience, the receipts from students and children will pay all the expenses.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct> died Mr. John Angell, who left <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure> for the purpose of building at Stockwell a college <QUOTE>for <num value="7">seven</num> decayed gentlemen, <num value="2">two</num> clergymen, an organist, <num value="6">six</num> singing-men, <num value="12">twelve</num> choristers, a verger, chapel clerk, and <num value="3">three</num> domestic servants,</QUOTE> which he endowed with rent-charges to the amount of <measure value="800l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="800">800</num></measure>   a year, besides making a provision for the daily food of the members. The good intentions of the testator, however, were for many years frustrated by a suit in Chancery respecting his will. The residence of Mr. Angell, at Stockwell, a large brick mansion, was for some time occupied as a boarding-school. His name is now kept in remembrance by the Angell Town Estate, on the east side of the Brixton Road. Early in the present century a Mr. Bailey, a merchant in St. Paul's  Churchyard, founded here an asylum for <num value="12">twelve</num> aged females. The building, a neat brick edifice, called Trinity Asylum, was erected in Acre Lane in <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>Another charitable institution here, and <num value="1">one</num> with more than a local reputation, is the Stockwell Orphanage for boys, founded under the auspices of Mr. Spurgeon, the pastor of the Metropolitan Tabernacle, of whom   we have already spoken. The institution, which covers a large space of ground on the Bedford estate, and forms a handsome quadrangle, is approached by a broad avenue from   the Clapham   Road.   At the end of this avenue, which is planted on either side with planetrees, is the entrance arch, an ornamental structure, surmounted by a bell-turret. On the piers of the archway are appropriate inscriptions, such as- <QUOTE>A Father of the fatherless and a Judge of the widow is God in his holy habitation;</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like <num value="1">one</num> of these;</QUOTE> and, <QUOTE>Your heavenly Father feedeth them.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The following description of the edifice is from the pen of Mr. Spurgeon himself:-- <QUOTE>On looking from under the arch the visitor is struck with the size and beauty of the buildings, and the delightfully airy and open character of the whole institution. It is a place of sweetness and light, where merry voices ring out, and happy children play. The stranger will be pleased with the dining-hall, hung round with engravings given by Mr. Graves, of Pall Mall; he will be shown into the boardroom, where the trustees transact the business; and he will be specially pleased with the great play-hall, in which our public meetings are held and the boys' sports are carried on. There is the swimming-bath, which enables us to say that nearly every boy can swim. Up at the very top of the buildings, after ascending <num value="2">two</num> flights of stairs, the visitor will find the school-rooms, which from their very position are airy and wholesome. The floors, scrubbed by the boys themselves, the beds made, and the domestic arrangements all kept in order by their own labour, are usually spoken of with approbation.</QUOTE> At the further end of the Orphanage grounds stands the infirmary. It is spacious enough to accommodate a large number of children, should an epidemic break out in the institution. 
   <P>The Orphanage, which was commenced in <datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>, and finished by the end of the following year, contains accommodation for <num value="250">250</num> children, who are here fed, clothed, and taught; and the expenses of the institution are about <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure> per annum. It is largely, if not mainly, dependent on voluntary contributions for its support.   The Orphanage, it should be stated, receives destitute fatherless boys, without respect to the religion of the parents. Children are eligible for entrance between the ages of <num value="6">six</num> and <num value="10">ten</num>, and they are received without putting the mothers to the trouble and expense of canvassing for votes, the trustees themselves selecting the most needy cases. The family system is carried out, the boys living in separate houses, under the care of matrons. 
   <P>Not far from the Orphanage, in Portland Place North, Clapham Road, lived Mr. Alfred Forrester. <pb id="P.330" n="330">

Born in London in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, Alfred Forrester was educated at a private institution at Islington, where he was a schoolfellow of Captain Marryatt.

   <P>On the north side of Stockwell, and hemmed in by Walworth, Newington, and South Lambeth, is the once royal manor of Kennington.   The name of Kennington, it is said by some topographers, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.331" n="2000.14.0123"><HEAD>Kennington, From The Green, <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 was probably derived originally from the Saxon Kyning-tun, <QUOTE>the town or place of the king.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>In the parish of Lambeth,</QUOTE> writes Hughson, in his <QUOTE>History of London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>is the manor of Kennington, which, in the Conqueror's Survey, is called Chenintun.   At that time it was in the possession of Theodoric, a goldsmith, who held it of Edward the Confessor.   There is no record to show how it reverted to the Crown; but during the time of Edward III. it was made part of the Duchy of Cornwall, to which it still continues annexed. Here was a royal palace, which was the residence of the Black Prince: it stood near the spot now called Kennington Cross. This palace was occasionally a residence of royalty down to the reign of Henry VII.   After his time the manor appears to have been let out to various persons. Charles I., however, when Prince of Wales, inhabited a house built on part of the site of the old palace, the stables of which, built of flint and stone, remained 
<hi rend=italics>in situ</hi> until the year <datestruct value="1795"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, when they were known as  <Q>The Long Barn.</Q> </QUOTE> 
   <P>Kennington is described in the <QUOTE>Tour round London,</QUOTE> in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, as <QUOTE>a village near Lambeth, in Surrey? and <num value="1">one</num> of the precincts of that parish.</QUOTE> <pb id="P.332" n="332"> It was formerly a lordship belonging to the ancient Earls of Warren, <num value="1">one</num> of whom, in the reign of Edward II., being childless, gave the manor to the king.   It had been already alienated, however, before the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> year of Edward III., and was part of the estate of Roger d&lsquo;Amory, who was attainted in the same reign for joining with sundry other lords in a seditious movement. Coming once more into the hands of the king, it was made a royal seat, and became shortly afterwards the principal residence of the Black Prince.   The author above quoted states of this once abode of royalty, that <QUOTE>there is nothing now remaining of this ancient seat but a building called The Long Barn, which in the year <datestruct value="1709"><year reg="1709">1709</year></datestruct> was <num value="1">one</num> of the receptacles of the poor persecuted Palatines.</QUOTE> 
    <P>It is generally accepted as a certainty that there was a royal residence near the spot now known as  Kennington Cross as far back as the Saxon times; and here, says tradition, Hardicanute died in the year <datestruct value="1041"><year reg="1041">1041</year></datestruct>. This amiable King of Denmark, <num value="3">third</num> son of Canute, succeeded to the English crown on the death of his brother, Harold Harefoot, whose body, it is related, he caused to be dug up from its tomb at Winchester, and afterwards to be beheaded and thrown into the Thames. <QUOTE>Some good fishermen,</QUOTE> so runs the story, <QUOTE>found the mangled trunk of the dead king, and decently interred it in the church of St. Clement Danes.  The peculiarly clement Dane who ruled over them, however, directly he heard of their pious act, again ordered his brother's body to be flung into the Thames.</QUOTE> <num value="2">Two</num> years afterwards Hardicanute went to Kennington (or, according to another account, to Lambeth), in order to honour the nuptial feast of a Danish lord; and there, within sight of the river on the banks of which Harold's corse had been washed by the stream, he fell dead, amidst the shouting and drinking of the guests assembled at the marriage banquet. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1189--"><year reg="1189">1189</year></datestruct>, Richard of the Lion Heart granted the manor to Sir Robert Percy; and it was afterwards the subject of frequent royal grants. As stated above, it seems to have been rather a favourite residence of Edward the Black Prince; and the road by which he reached the palace from the landing-place at the water-side, nearly corresponding with Upper Kennington Lane, long retained the name of Princes Road.   Here died that powerful vassal of Edward I., John, Earl of Warren and Surrey, in <datestruct VALUE="1304-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1304">1304</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>Again, the kings of Scotland, France, and Cyprus being in England in the year <datestruct value="1363"><year reg="1363">1363</year></datestruct>, on a visit to Edward III., Henry Picard, who had been lord mayor, had the honour of entertaining these <num value="4">four</num> monarchs, with the Prince of Wales and other illustrious persons. At another time, the citizens gave a grand masquerade on horseback for the amusement of the Black Prince's son, Richard (then in his <num value="10">tenth</num> year), and his mother, Joan of Kent.   The procession set out from   Newgate, and proceeded to Kennington, and was composed of stately pageants, in masques, <num value="1">one</num> of which represented the pope and <num value="24">twenty-four</num> cardinals. This <QUOTE>great mummery</QUOTE> consisted of <num value="130">130</num> citizens in fancy dresses, with trumpets, sackbuts, and minstrels; and they danced and <QUOTE>mummed</QUOTE> to their hearts' content in the great hall of the palace; after which, having been right royally feasted, they returned again to the City by way of London Bridge. 
    <P><num value="19">Nineteen</num> years afterwards, when the young king wanted money, and to that end made up his mind to take a <num value="2">second</num> wife, he married Isabel, daughter of Charles VI. of France--the <QUOTE>little queen,</QUOTE> as she was pettingly styled, for she was but a child, under <num value="8">eight</num> years of age. The royal train, on approaching London, was met on Blackheath<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="225">225</num>.</NOTE> by the lord mayor and aldermen, habited in scarlet, who attended the king to Newington  (Surrey), where he dismissed them, as he and his youthful bride were to <QUOTE>rest at Kenyngtoun.</QUOTE> When the poor child was taken from Kennington to her lodgings in the Tower, the press to see her was so great that several persons were crushed to death on London Bridge-among them the Prior of Tiptree, in Essex. 
   <P>At Kennington, John of Gaunt sought refuge from the citizens, after he had quarrelled with the Bishop of London. The proud Lancaster was <num value="1">one</num> of the protectors of Wyclif, who was, of course, particularly unpopular with the prelates, and had bearded the bishop in a very irreverent manner. The good churchmen of London, who had small respect for royalty when royalty chanced to offend them, chased the ducal offender in the very same year in which they danced before his nephew, and he was glad to be quiet for some time in the old palace.   His son, the fiery Bolingbroke, after he became king, sometimes resided here, as did his grandson, the unfortunate Henry VI., and Henry VII., and Katharine of Arragon. James I. settled the manor of Kennington on the Prince of Wales, and it has ever since formed part of the princely possessions. The manor had been purchased in <datestruct VALUE="1604-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1604">1604</year></datestruct>, by Alleyn, the player, and founder of Dulwich College, for <measure value="1065l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1065">1,065</num></measure>, and sold <num value="5">five</num> years afterwards by the astute actor-who <pb id="P.333" n="333"> knew how to turn a penny, and made good use of his savings--for <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>. It was of him, probably, that it was purchased by James I., who rebuilt the manor-house.   The last fragment of the old palace--the <QUOTE>Old Barn,</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>Long Barn</QUOTE> re- mained till near the close of the last century; and the old manor-house itself, having served for some years as a Female Philanthropic School, finally disappeared in <datestruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct>.   From   an account of the building, published at the time of its demolition, we gather the following interesting particulars:-- The <num value="1">first</num> object which struck the visitor was the canopied head to the outer doorway, supported by finely carved trusses. The entrance door was very massive, and the large lock and unwieldy bar were suggestive of the times when every precaution was necessary for the safe custody of property. The rooms were square and lofty, with old-fashioned chimney-openings. The finest specimen of decorative art was, without doubt, the modelled plaster ceiling in the back room. The enrichments were finely undercut and in alto-relief, the mouldings and border being in true character with the other portions. The staircase was of massive oak, and the mouldings cut in the solid.   The doors and the wainscot dado were also solid oak, the latter being a particularly fine specimen of wainscoting. The substantial timbers, door, and window-frames and heads to the last were in an excellent state of preservation.   The estate having been leased to a speculative builder, the old house was demolished in order to make room for modern residences. 
    <P>Here, on a waste piece of land belonging to the  Prince of Wales, as part of the old royal palace and demesne, lay for some years a quantity of the marble statues which had been removed from  Arundel House, in the Strand, and which afterwards decorated <QUOTE>Kuper's Gardens,</QUOTE> the site of which we shall presently visit. Here they were discovered by connoisseurs, and were purchased, some by Lord Burlington for his villa at Chiswick, and others by Mr. Freeman, of Fawley Court, near  Henley-on-Thames, and by Mr. Edmund Waller, of  Beaconsfield.   Others were cut up and used to make mantel-pieces for private houses in Lambeth. 
   <P>It would appear that Kennington is still regarded as an appanage of royalty; at all events, it gave the title of earl to the hero of Culloden, William the <QUOTE>butcher,</QUOTE> Duke of Cumberland, the younger son of George II. The duke's name is kept in remembrance here by Cumberland Row, close by the Vestry Hall, Kennington Green: it forms a low row of cottages, bearing date <datestruct value="1666"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>. Their unfinished carcases had been used as a lazarhouse during the great plague of the previous year. The Prince of Wales, it may be added, is still the ground landlord of several streets in Kennington. 
    <P>The manor of Kennington subsequently reverted to the Crown, and was granted by Charles I., when Prince of Wales, to Sir Noel Caron and Sir Francis Cottington. Sir Noel Caron was Dutch Ambassador to the English Court during the early part of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. He erected here a handsome mansion, with <num value="2">two</num> wings. On the front was the inscription, <QUOTE>Omne solum forti patria.</QUOTE> He built also on the roadside the almshouses near the <num value="3">third</num> mile-stone for <num value="7">seven</num> poor women.   His name is inscribed on their front, with the date, <datestruct value="1618"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct>, and a Latin inscription to the effect that <QUOTE>He that hath pity on the poor lendeth to the Lord.</QUOTE> Caron House, and the gardens attached to it, are memorable as having been granted by Charles II. to Lord Chancellor Clarendon, who sold them to Sir Jeremias Whichcote. The <hi rend=italics>London Gazette</hi> tells us that the prisoners from the Fleet were removed hither after the Fire of London; it was pulled down soon after, and the last remains of the house were removed early in the present century. What remained of it in <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, when Hughson wrote his <QUOTE>History of London and its Suburbs,</QUOTE> was used as an academy, and still retained its former name of Caron House. Not far from it was-and perhaps still is--a spring of clear water called Vauxhall Well, which is said not to freeze in the very coldest winters. 
    <P>A portion of the site of Sir Noel Caron's park is absorbed in the well-known cricket-ground called Kennington Oval, which shares with <QUOTE>Lord's</QUOTE> <NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="260">260</num>.</NOTE>
the honour of being the scene of many of those doughty encounters between the heroes of the bat and ball which have made the <QUOTE>elevens</QUOTE> of the north and south, of Surrey and Nottingham, Kent and Sussex, United and All England, all but immortal. The Oval, which, within the memory of living persons, was a cabbage-garden, covers about <num value="9">nine</num> acres of ground, and is set apart entirely for cricket-matches. It was <num value="1">first</num> opened as a cricket-ground on the <datestruct VALUE="1846-04-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct>, as the speculation of a man named Houghton. The Surrey Club have held it for many years on a lease from the Duchy of Cornwall, to which the land hereabouts still belongs; a fact which is kept in remembrance by the <QUOTE>Duchy Arms</QUOTE> inn, <QUOTE>Cornwall</QUOTE> Cottages, &amp;c. 
   <P>In Meadow Street, which testifies to the once rural character of this locality, stands, in grounds of its own, St. Joseph's Convent belonging to the Little Sisters of the Poor, a community about whom <pb id="P.334" n="334"> we shall have more to say when we pay a visit to their other house at Hammersmith. 
    <P>In South Lambeth, on the south of Fentiman Road, which crosses the Oval Road, is the extensive vinegar distillery of the Messrs. Beaufoy, which was removed here many years ago from Cuper's Gardens. The works, which cover a space of about <num value="5">five</num> acres, occupy the site of Caron House. 
   <P>Nearly adjoining to the distillery, southward, is, or was till a recent date, <LEMMA id="lemma.334.1">the residence of John  Tradescant, the botanist</LEMMA>. The house, a plain brick building, with a court-yard in front and large iron gates, had attached to it the physic-garden of the  Tradescants, <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> established in this country.   Tradescant's   museum   was frequently visited by persons of rank, who became benefactors thereto; among these were Charles I. (to whom he was gardener), Queen Henrietta Maria, Archbishop  Laud, George, Duke of Buckingham, Robert and  William Cecil, Earls of Salisbury, and many other persons of distinction. Among them also appears the philosophic John Evelyn, who, in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date of <datestruct VALUE="1657-09-17"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=17>17</day>, <year reg=1657>1657</year></datestruct>, has the following entry :-- <QUOTE>I went to see Sir Robert Needham, at Lambeth, a relation of mine, and thence to John Tradescant's museum.</QUOTE> Evelyn also speaks of supping at John Tradescant's house, in company with Dr. (subsequently Archbishop) Tenison, the Bishop of St. Asaph, and Lady Clarendon. 
   <P> <QUOTE>I know,</QUOTE> writes Izaak Walton, in his <QUOTE>Complete Angler,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>we islanders are averse to the belief of wonders; but there be so many strange creatures to be now seen, many collected by John Tradescant, and others added by my friend Elias Ashmole, Esq., who now keeps them   carefully and methodically at his house near to Lambeth, near London, as may yet get belief of some of the other wonders I mentioned. I will tell you some of the wonders that you may now see, and not till then believe, unless you think fit. You may see there the hog-fish, the dog-fish, the dolphin, the coney-fish, the parrot-fish, the shark, the poisonfish, the sword-fish; and not only other incredible fish, but you may there see the salamander, several sorts of barnacles, of Solan geese, and the bird of paradise; such sorts of snakes, and such birds'nests, and of so various forms and so wonderfully made, as may beget wonder and amazement in any beholder; and so many hundreds of other rarities in that collection, as will make the other wonders I spake of the less incredible.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The Tradescants were the <num value="1">first</num> well-known collectors of natural curiosities in this kingdom; they were followed by Ashmole and Sir Hans Sloane, from whom their spirit was afterwards transfused into Sir Ashton Lever, whose collection we mentioned in our account of Leicester Square.<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="165">165</num>.</NOTE>   It was a great misfortune that the collection, instead of being sold in lots by auction, was not secured for the British Museum. 
    <P>There are portraits of the Tradescants to be seen in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford.   It is usually said that it was the elder Tradescant who <num value="1">first</num> introduced apricots into England, by entering himself on board of a privateer armed against  Morocco, whence he stole that fruit which it was forbidden to export. 
    <P>In Allen's <QUOTE>History of Surrey</QUOTE> we read:-- <QUOTE>On the death of John Tradescant, Dr. Ducarel says his son sold the curiosities to the celebrated Elias Ashmole; but Mr. Nichols, in a note, observes that the doctor must be in error, for, according to the diary of Ashmole, it appears that on <datestruct VALUE="1659-12-15"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=15>15</day>, <year reg=1659>1659</year></datestruct>, Mr. Tradescant and his wife signed a deed of gift to Ashmole.

Dr. Ducarel's house, once a part of Tradescant's, adjoins.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Kennington   Park, which   stretches for some distance along the Kennington Road, and lies to the east of the Oval, was known as Kennington Common till only a few years ago, when it was a dreary piece of waste land, covered partly with short grass, and frequented only by boys flying their kites or playing at marbles.   It was encircled with some tumble-down wooden rails, which were not sufficient to keep donkeys from straying there. Field   preachers also made it <num value="1">one</num> of the chief scenes of oratorical display.   It consisted of about <num value="20">twenty</num> acres. It was suddenly seized with a fit of respectability, and clothed itself around with elegant iron railings, its area being, at the same time, cut up by gravel walks, and flower-beds, and shrubberies. It also engaged a beadle to look after it. And so it became a park, and--it must be owned-an ornament to the neighbourhood. 
    <P>The Common is described in the <QUOTE>Tour round  London,</QUOTE> in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, as <QUOTE>a small spot of ground on the road to Camberwell, and about a mile and a half from London.   Upon this spot is erected the gallows for the county of Surrey; but few have suffered here of late years.   Such of the (Scottish) rebels as were tried by the Special Commission, in <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct>, and ordered for execution, suffered at this place; amongst whom were those who commanded the regiment raised at Manchester for the use  (service) of the Pretender.</QUOTE> In fact, very many of those who had <QUOTE>been out</QUOTE> in the Scottish rising of <pb id="P.335" n="335"> the previous year here suffered the last penalty of the law. Among them were Sir John Wedderburn, John Hamilton, Andrew   Wood, and Alexander Leith, and also <num value="2">two</num> English gentlemen of good family, named Towneley and Fletcher, who had joined the standard of <QUOTE>Bonny Prince Charlie</QUOTE> at Manchester.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="58">58</num>.</NOTE>   Wood, it is said, bravely drank a glass to the <QUOTE>Pretender's</QUOTE> health on the scaffold. Others engaged in the same cause also suffered here; among them Captain James (or, as he is still called, <QUOTE><hi rend=italics>Jemmy</hi></QUOTE> ) Dawson, over whose body, as soon as the headsman's axe had done its terrible work, a young lady, who was attached to him tenderly, threw herself in a swoon, and died literally of a broken heart. The event forms the subject of <num value="1">one</num> of Shenstone's ballads:-- 
           <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=stanza><LG type=couplet><L>Young Dawson was a gallant boy, 
                <L>A brighter never trod the plain; 
             <L>And well he loved <num value="1">one</num> charming maid, 
                <L>And dearly was he loved again. .

             <L>The maid drew back her languid head, 
                <L>And, sighing forth his name, expired.</QUOTE>

    <P>Dawson   and   <num value="8">eight</num> others were dragged on hurdles from the new gaol in Southwark to Kennington Common, and there hanged. After being suspended for <num value="3">three</num> minutes from the gallows, their bodies were stripped naked and cut down, in order to undergo the operation of beheading and embowelling.   Colonel Towneley was the <num value="1">first</num> that was laid upon the block, but the executioner observing the body to retain some signs of life, he struck it violently on the breast, for the humane purpose of rendering it quite insensible for the remaining portion of the punishment. This not having the desired effect, he cut the unfortunate gentleman's throat.   The shocking ceremony of taking out the heart and throwing the bowels into the fire was then gone through, after which the head was separated from the body with a cleaver, and both were put into a coffin. The rest of the bodies were thus treated in succession; and on throwing the last heart into the fire, which was that of young Dawson, the executioner cried, <QUOTE>God save King George!</QUOTE> and the spectators responded with a shout. Although the rabble had hooted the unhappy gentlemen on the passage to and from their trials, it was remarked that at the execution their fate excited considerable pity, mingled with admiration of their courage. <num value="2">Two</num> circumstances contributed to increase the public sympathy on this occasion, and caused it to be more generally expressed. The <num value="1">first</num> was, the appearance at the place of execution of a youthful brother of <num value="1">one</num> of the culprits, of the name of Deacon, himself a culprit, and under sentence of death for the same crime, but who had been permitted to attend the last scene of his brother's life in a coach along with a guard.   The other was the, fact of a young and beautiful woman, to whom Dawson had been betrothed, actually attending to witness his execution, as stated above. 
    <P>Most of the rebel lords, and of the others who had borne a share in the Scottish rising of <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>, and   who   were found   guilty of treason, were executed on Tower Hill, as already stated.<NOTE>See Vol. I., p. <num value="95">95</num>.</NOTE>  Their, heads, as well as the heads of those executed here, were afterwards set up on poles on the top of Temple Bar,<NOTE>See Vol. I., p. <num value="28">28</num>.</NOTE>   where we have already seen them bleaching in the sun and rain.   Here also was hung the notorious highwayman, <QUOTE>Jerry Abershaw;</QUOTE> his body being afterwards hung in chains on a gibbet on Wimbledon Common. 
    <P>In the spring of <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct>, just after the Revolution which drove Louis Philippe from Paris, Kennington  Common obtained a temporary celebrity as the intended rallying-point of the Chartists of London, who, it was said, were half a million in number; but of this number only about <num value="15000">15,000</num>   actually assembled; had the half a million met, it would have required   nearly <num value="10">ten</num> times the space of  Kennington Common!   On the <datestruct VALUE="-04-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct> the great meeting came off; they were to march thence in procession to Westminster, in order to present a monster petition in favour of the <num value="6">six</num> points of the charter, signed by <num value="6">six</num> millions.   But measures were prudently taken by the Government; the Bank and other public buildings were strictly guarded; the military were called out, and posted in concealed   positions near the bridges; and  <num value="170000">170,000</num> special constables were enrolled, among whom was Louis Napoleon, the future Emperor of  France.   On the eventful day the working men who answered to the call of their leaders-Feargus  O&lsquo;Connor and Ernest Jones--were found to be scarcely <num value="50000">50,000</num>, and these gentlemen shrank from a contest with the soldiery. So the crowd broke up, and the petition was presented peaceably.

 <pb id="P.337" n="337"> British Island, the culminating point of the revolutionary progress which, within a period of little more than <num value="2">two</num> months, had shaken almost every throne of Continental Europe. In England nothing was shaken but the hopes of the disaffected. From <num value="1">one</num> end of Europe to the other, the Ioth of April was looked forward to by the partisans of revolution as the day which was to add London to the list of capitals submitting to the dictation of the mob. The spirit of revolt had run like wildfire from kingdom to kingdom, and capital to capital. Paris, Vienna, Naples, Berlin, Dresden, Milan, Venice, Palermo, Frankfort, and Carlsruhe, had all experienced the revolutionary shock, and none had been able completely to withstand it. Now came the turn of London, the greatest capital of all--the greatest prize that the world could afford to revolutionary adventurethe most magnificent prey to the bands of the plunderers who moved about from <num value="1">one</num> point of Europe to another, committing robberies under the name of revolution. London withstood the shock, and escaped without the slightest injury. Even the wild spirit of revolt, made drunk by the extraordinary success it had achieved throughout 
<FIGURE id="Fig.337" n="2000.14.0125"><HEAD>Tradescant's House, South Lambeth. (From Pennant.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 Continental Europe, was frozen into fear by the calm, complete, and stern preparation which was made to encounter and to crush it. The spirit of <LEMMA id="lemma.338.1">Wellingtton</LEMMA> was equal to the occasion, and seemed to pervade the might and the energy of the vast metropolis of England while that veteran was at the head of the resisting power .         . The Ioth of April seemed, as if by mutual consent, to be the day of trial between the rival forces ot revolution and of authority, and it then plainly appeared, without any actual collision, that the revolutionists had no chance. All their points of attack had been anticipated. Everywhere there was preparation to receive them, and yet nothing was so openly done as to produce a sense of public alarm. London was armed to the teeth: and yet, in outward appearance, it was not changed. The force that had been prepared lay hushed in grim repose, and was kept out of sight. The revolutionary leaders were, however, made aware of the consequences that would ensue if they went <num value="1">one</num> step beyond that which the authorities deemed to be consistent with the public safety. Foolish and trantic though they were in their political talk, they were not so mad as to rush upon certain <pb id="P.338" n="338"> destruction. They gave up the conflict; and from that day the spirit of revolution in England drooped and died away. The political conspirators against existing authority failed utterly, not because they were destitute of the enthusiasm meet for such an occasion, or that there were no real grievances in the condition of the people which called for redress, but because the nation had common sense enough to perceive that the ascendancy of such desperate adventurers would make matters worse than better.   It was not that the Londoners had no taste for political improvement, but it was that they had a very decided distaste for being robbed. Not only was all the intelligence, the organisation, and the resource of the country arrayed in opposition to the mode of political action which the revolutionists of Europe had adopted, but the familiar instincts of the hundreds of thousands who had property to guard and hearths to preserve inviolate arrayed them in determined resistance to mob violence, whatever might be the avowed object to which that violence should be directed.</QUOTE> Thus, in the words of the <hi rend=italics>Times</hi>, <QUOTE>The great demonstration was brought to a ridiculous issue by the unity and resolution of the metropolis, backed by the judicious measures of the Government, and the masterly military precautions of the Duke of Wellington, though no military display was anywhere to be seen.</QUOTE> 
    <P>During the holiday season, Kennington Common in the last century was an epitome of <QUOTE>Bartlemy Fair,</QUOTE> with booths, tents, caravans, and scaffolds, surmounted by flags.   It also had <num value="1">one</num> peculiarity, for, as we learn from <title>In Merrie England in the Olden Time</title>, it was a favourite spot for merryandrews, and other buffooneries in open rivalry, and competition with field-preachers and ranters. It was here that Mr. Maw-worm encountered the brickbats of his congregation, and had his <QUOTE>pious tail</QUOTE> illuminated with the squibs and crackers of the unregenerate. 
   <P>During the year <datestruct value="1739"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>, when the south of London was a pleasant country suburb, George Whitefield preached frequently on this common, his audience being generally reckoned by tens of thousands. In his <QUOTE>Journal,</QUOTE> under date <datestruct VALUE="-05-6"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=6>6th</day></datestruct> in that year, he thus remarks: <QUOTE>Preached this morning in Moorfields to about <num value="20000">20,000</num> people, who were very quiet and attentive, and much affected.   Went to public worship morning and evening, and at <num value="6">six</num> preached at Kennington.   But such a sight never were my eyes blessed with before. I believe there were no less than <num value="50000">50,000</num> people, near fourscore coaches, besides great numbers of horses; and what is most remarkable, there was such an awful silence amongst them, and the word of God came with such power, that all, I believe, were pleasingly surprised. God gave me great enlargement of heart. I continued my discourse for an hour and a half; and when I returned home, I was filled with such love, peace, and joy, that I cannot express it.</QUOTE> On subsequent occasions Mr. Whitefield mentions having addressed audiences of <num value="30000">30,000</num>, <num value="20000">20,000</num>, and <num value="10000">10,000</num> on this same spot. The example thus set by Whitefield was soon afterwards followed by Charles Wesley, with an equal amount of fervour. In <datestruct VALUE="1739-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>, Charles Wesley being summoned before the Archbishop of Canterbury to give an account of his <QUOTE>irregularity,</QUOTE> he was for a time greatly troubled; but Whitefield, whom   he had consulted for advice in this emergency, told him, <QUOTE>Preach in the fields next Sunday; by this step you will break down the bridge, render your retreat difficult, or impossible, and be forced to fight your way forward.</QUOTE> This counsel was followed, for in Charles Wesley's diary, <datestruct VALUE="1739-06-24"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=24>24th</day>, <year reg=1739>1739</year></datestruct>, occurs this passage :-- <QUOTE>I walked to Kennington Common, and cried to multitudes upon multitudes,  <Q>Repent ye, and believe the Gospel.</Q>  The Lord was my strength, and my mouth, and my wisdom.</QUOTE> 
    <P> <QUOTE>Kennington Common,</QUOTE> wrote Thomas Miller, in his <QUOTE>Picturesque Sketches in London,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>is but a name for a small grassless square, surrounded with houses, and poisoned by the stench of vitriol works, and by black, open, sluggish ditches; what it will be when the promised alterations are completed, we have yet to see.</QUOTE> That the place, however, has since become conpletely changed in appearance we need scarcely state, for it was converted into a public pleasureground, under the Act <num value="15">15</num> and <num value="16">16</num> Vict., in June of the above-mentioned year.   It now affords a very pretty promenade.   What was once but a dismal waste, some <num value="20">twenty</num> acres in extent, is now laid out in grass-plats, intersected by broad and well-kept gravelled walks bordered with flower-beds.   A pair of the model farm-cottages of the late Prince Consort were erected in the middle of the western side, near the entrance, about the year <datestruct value="1850"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>. More recently, in addition to the improvements effected by the change of the Common to an ornamental promenade, a church, dedicated to St. Agnes, was built on the site of the vitriol works. 
   <P>On the <num value="1">first</num> formation of the <QUOTE>park,</QUOTE> the sum of <measure value="1800l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1800">1,800</num></measure>       annually was voted by the Government; but this sum   was subsequently reduced, until, in the year <datestruct value="1877"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>, it was only <measure value="1370l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1370">1,370</num></measure>; and these reductions had been made although there had been an increase in the total sum devoted to public parks. <pb id="P.339" n="339"> 
   <P>On the eastern side of the Common, in the middle of the last century, stood a mansion, once the residence of Sir Richard Manley.   Near the site of this mansion, occupying the site of the vitriol works just mentioned, and directly facing the central paths of the ornamental garden, now stands the church of St. Agnes. The edifice, which was erected from the designs of Sir G. Gilbert Scott, is in the English Middle Pointed style of architecture of the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century; and it depends mainly for its effect upon its loftiness, the height being <num value="65">sixty-five</num> feet from the floor to the nave ceiling, and <num value="75">seventy-five</num> feet to the external ridge, and the chancel roof of the same height. The most important feature in the decorative work of the church is the east window of <num value="6">six</num> lights, illustrating the doctrines of the Incarnation and the Atonement, the stained glass of which, costing <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure>, was executed by Mr. C. E. Kempe, and forms a memorial to the lady who was the chief benefactress of the church. The illustration of the Incarnation was <QUOTE>A Tree of Jesse,</QUOTE> or genealogical tree of Christ's progenitors, of which the Virgin Mary, holding the Divine Child in her arms, formed the principal figure, the Virgin's head being crowned.   When, in accordance with customary usage, the building was inspected by the bishop's representative, the archdeacon, the existence of this design was mentioned, and before the ceremony of consecration was performed, the figure of the Blessed   Virgin was removed   by the bishop's desire.

    <P>On the southern portion of the Common, on the upper part of a small triangular plot of ground, separated from the larger portion of the Common by the road to Brixton and the Camberwell New  Road, stands St. Mark's Church, the <num value="2">second</num> of the district churches erected in this parish.   What is now the site of the church was formerly the spot where the gallows were erected for the execution of criminals; and it is rendered more interesting by its being the actual spot where many of the unfortunate adherents to the expatriated family of the  Stuarts fell a sacrifice to their principles, as we have stated above.   In preparing the foundation of the church, the site of a gibbet was discovered; and a curious piece of iron, which it is supposed was the swivel attached to the head of a criminal, was turned up a foot or <num value="2">two</num> below the surface. 
    <P>St. Mark's Church, which was finished in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, from the designs of Mr. D.

The eastern end is brought out, to form a recess for the communion-table, and to the western end is attached the tower, sided by lobbies, containing staircases to the galleries; and the whole is fronted by a portico, formed of <num value="4">four</num> columns, supporting an entablature of the Greek Doric order, finished with a pediment. The tower, which is square and massive, is surmounted by a circular structure, composed of fluted Ionic columns, and finished with a plain spherical cupola, on the apex of which is a stone cross of elegant design. The main portion of the church is constructed of brick, and has stone pilasters attached   to   the piers between the windows, which are singularly plain and uninteresting.   The interior of the church, beyond its elliptically-coved ceiling, ornamented at intervals with groups of foliage, contains nothing to call for special remark. 
   <P>Along the south side of the churchyard once ran a small stream, which was crossed by a bridge, called Merton Bridge, from   its formerly having been repaired by the canons of Merton Abbey, who had lands bequeathed   to   them   for that purpose. 
    <P>Opposite the western gates of the park, and at the entrance to Kennington Road, is the <QUOTE>Horns  Tavern.</QUOTE> It stands at the junction of the roads leading to London and Westminster Bridges; and the assembly-rooms adjoining have for many years been a great place for public meetings. There is nothing, so far as we are aware, to connect this inn with such ceremonies as those formerly enacted at  Highgate<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="413">413</num>.</NOTE> and at Charlton,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="233">233</num>.</NOTE> in which, as we have shown, the <QUOTE>horns</QUOTE> played such a conspicuous part; it may have been that a former landlord was desirous of emulating the reputation enjoyed by his professional brethren at Highgate. 
    <P>Pursuing our course along Kennington Road, we leave on our left the water-works belonging to the South London Company.   In <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct> an Act of  Parliament was passed for establishing the abovementioned company, who were <QUOTE>to form reservoirs near Kennington Green, to be supplied from the  Thames along Vauxhall Creek, or at a creek on the other side of Cumberland Gardens, between that and Marble Hall, all in this parish.</QUOTE> The work was undertaken; a field of <num value="5">five</num> acres, between  Kennington Lane and the Oval, was procured, on which <num value="2">two</num> reservoirs were formed, with steamengines and the requisite offices and buildings.  In <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct> the proprietor celebrated the completion of the undertaking by giving a public breakfast.  The reservoirs were intended to bring the water into a state of purity before it was distributed; but it was found that it did not answer thoroughly, and <pb id="P.340" n="340"> a change of site had to be made for the enginehouse. 
   <P>At the point where the road turns off from Kennington Lane to the Oval, was in former times a noted place of entertainment, known as <QUOTE>Spring Garden.</QUOTE> <NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="77">77</num>.</NOTE>   Bray, in his <title>History of Surrey</title>, says that Moncony mentions a Spring Garden at Lambeth as much frequented in <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct>. The gardens were at <num value="1">one</num> time held by Mrs. Cornelys, of whom we have already had occasion to speak in our account of Soho Square.<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="188">188</num>.</NOTE>   Mrs. Cornelys, we are told, had <QUOTE>a large white house for entertainment ;</QUOTE> but being frequented by loose and dissolute persons, it was suppressed by the magistracy. 
   <P>In Upper Kennington Lane, which runs from Kennington Cross to Vauxhall Bridge, is the <LEMMA id="lemma.340.1">Licensed Victuallers' School</LEMMA>, an establishment more to be regarded for the benevolent views of its patrons than for the architectural beauty of the building which contains the objects of their protection. The society was established in the year <datestruct value="1803"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, and is supported by the respectable body of licensed victuallers of the metropolis as an asylum and school for the orphans and children of the destitute part of their brethren. A portion of the profits of their trade journal, the <hi rend=italics>Morning Advertiser</hi>, is also added to its funds. The building is a series of dwellinghouses, added together at various times, as the funds and objects of the institution increased, and is therefore little else than a substantial commodious edifice, with a spacious playground and gardens, located in an airy situation. Its original design has been somewhat improved by a central tablet of stucco over the pedimented door as a sort of centre.   The building was constructed with the view   of accommodating   <num value="200">two hundred</num> children. Great exertions have been made to realise this design, and by the admission of all the approved candidates for <num value="3">three</num> successive years, it was all but accomplished. 
   <P>At various times, Kennington has been   the residence of many eminent persons, among whom we may mention John, <num value="7">seventh</num> Earl of Warrenne and Surrey, father-in-law of John Balliol, who died here in <datestruct value="1304--"><year reg="1304">1304</year></datestruct>; David   Ricardo, the celebrated political economist; the   Duke of Brunswick; William Hogarth; and Eliza Cook, who lived here for many years.   It has also been the home of many persons connected with the theatres. Here died, in <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>, Mr. E. T. Smith, of Cremorne, the Alhambra, and Drury Lane celebrity. 
    <P>Kennington in its day has seen its deeds of violence; for it appears that in <datestruct value="1323--"><year reg="1323">1323</year></datestruct> Elizabeth, the wife of Sir Richard Talbot, of Goderich Castle, in Herefordshire, was forcibly seized at her house in this parish by Hugh Despencer, Earl of Gloucester, in conjunction with his father, Hugh, Earl of Winchester, and carried off. It is satisfactory to know that for this act the Despencers suffered the extreme penalty of the law; the head of the younger <num value="1">one</num> being set up on London Bridge. Their estate, of course, became confiscated and pounced upon by royalty; and the king very naturally bestowed it on the Prince of Wales, to whom it still belongs. 
   <P>Before closing this chapter, we may remark that the maypole nearest to the metropolis that stood longest within the memory of the editor of the <QUOTE>Beauties of England   and   Wales,</QUOTE> was near Kennington Green, at the back of the houses at the south-west corner of the Workhouse Lane, leading from   the Vauxhall Road to   Elizabeth Place. The site was then nearly vacant, and the maypole stood in the field on the south side of the Workhouse Lane, nearly opposite to the <QUOTE>Black Prince</QUOTE> public-house.   It remained there till about the year <datestruct value="1795"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, and was much frequented, particularly by the milkmaids, on   May-day.   The maypoles in the country were the scenes of much simplicity of rural manners and innocent mirth and enjoyment; but those set up near London, it is to be feared, were provocative of far more boisterous rudeness.   In <datestruct value="1517--"><year reg="1517">1517</year></datestruct> the unfortunate shaft, or maypole, gave rise to the insurrection of that turbulent body, the London apprentices, and the plundering of the foreigners in the City, whence it got the name of Evil May-day. <QUOTE>From that time,</QUOTE> writes the author of <QUOTE>Merrie   England in the Olden Time,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>the offending pole was hung on a range of hooks over the doors of a long row of neighbouring houses. In the <num value="3">third</num> year of Edward VI., an over-zealous fanatic, called Sir Stephen, began to preach against this maypole, which inflamed the audience so greatly that the owner of every house over which it hung sawed off as much as depended over his premises, and committed piecemeal to the flames this terrible idol</QUOTE> Like the morris-dancers, and the hobby-horse, and other much-applauded merriments of Old England, the maypole in the end has become a thing of the past, for they were put down or allowed to pass into oblivion. 
    <P>The old Roman road, or Watling Street, for a short distance, intersected the north-eastern corner of Surrey in its progress from   <hi rend=italics>Vagniacis</hi> (supposed by antiquaries to be near Southfleet in Kent) to  London, skirting the eastern side of Kennington.  This road is presumed to have passed through Old  Croydon or Woodcote, Streathcm, and Newington, <pb id="P.341" n="341"> to Stone Street in Southwark. If, as some writers have supposed, the ancient <hi rend=italics>Noviomagus</hi>   was at Old Croydon, the Ermyn Street must have followed nearly the present line of roads through Streatham, Kennington, and Newington, into Southwark; and thence it was continued in a northward direction by way of Stoke Newington, as we have already mentioned in a former volume.<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="531">531</num>.</NOTE>

 <P>In the above lines, the Brothers Smith, the authors of the <QUOTE>Rejected Addresses,</QUOTE> in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, lamented the decline alike of sports and of rural beauty, which were once the chief characteristics of this locality; but even this description has long ceased to be applicable.   Perhaps the following stanza, though less poetic, quoted from Tallis's <QUOTE>Illustrated  London,</QUOTE> would present the reader of to-day with a more faithful character of St. George's Fields : 
           <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=couplet><L>Thy  <Q> civic villas,</Q>  witty Smith, 
               <L>Have fled, as well as woodland copse; 
             <L>Where erst the water-lily bloomed 
               <L>Are planted rows of brokers' shops.</QUOTE>

    <P>St. George's Fields were named after the adjacent church of St. George the Martyr, and appear once to have been marked by all the floral beauty of meadows, uninvaded by London smoke.   We learn from   Mr. Cunningham   that Gerard came here to collect specimens of his <QUOTE>Herbal.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Of water-violets,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>I have not found such plenty in any <num value="1">one</num> place as the water ditches adjoining St. George his fielde near London.</QUOTE> And yet these <QUOTE>fields,</QUOTE> together with Lambeth Marsh--which lies between them and the Thames --were at <num value="1">one</num> time almost covered with water at every high tide, and across which the Romans threw embanked roads, and on which they reared villas, after the Dutch summer-house fashion, on piles. Indeed, St. George's Fields were certainly occupied by the Romans, for large quantities of Roman remains, coins, tesselated pavements, urns, and bones have been found there. They formed probably <num value="1">one</num> of the <foreign lang=la>aestiva</foreign>, or summer camps; for in the winter a great part of them, now known as Lambeth Marsh and Marsh Gate, were under water. It is not stated when all this ground was <num value="1">first</num> drained, but various ancient commissions are remaining for persons to survey the banks of the river, here and in the adjoining parishes, and to take measures for repairing them, and to impress such workmen as they should find necessary for that employment; notwithstanding which, these periodical overflows continued to do considerable mischief; and Strype, in his edition of Stow's <QUOTE>Survey,</QUOTE> informs us that, so late as <datestruct value="1555"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct>, owing to this cause and some great rains which had then fallen, all St. George's Fields were covered with water.   Inundations, therefore, are no novelty to the lands on the south of the Thames near London. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1016--"><year reg="1016">1016</year></datestruct>, as we have already had occasion to observe,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="132">132</num>.</NOTE> Canute laid siege to London; but finding that the bridge was so strongly fortified by the citizens that he could not come up with his vessels to make any impression on the Thames side of the place, he projected the design   of making a canal through St. George's Fields, then marshes, wide and deep enough to convey his ships to the west of the bridge, and to enable him by that means to invest the town on all sides. The line of this canal, called <QUOTE>Canute's Trench,</QUOTE> ran from the great wet dock, below Rotherhithe, through Newington, to the river Thames again at Chelsea Reach; but its exact course cannot now be traced. 
   <P>Dr. Wallis, in a letter to Samuel Pepys, dated in <datestruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct>, speaks of having walked, <num value="50">fifty</num> years before, from   Stangate, close by Westminster Bridge, to Redriff [Rotherhithe], <QUOTE>across the fields</QUOTE> to Lambeth, meaning there to cross the Thames to Westminster.   On this occasion, he writes, a friend <QUOTE>showed me in the passage diverse remains of the <pb id="P.342" n="342"> old channel which had been heretofore made from Redriff to Lambeth for diverting the Thames whilst London Bridge was a-building, all in a straight line or near it, but with great intervals which had long since been filled up; those remains which then appeared so visible, are now, I suspect, all or most of them   filled up, for . . . people in those marshes would be more fond of so much meadow grounds than to let those lakes remain unfilled.</QUOTE> In the same letter he speaks of the southern shore of the river as <QUOTE>full of flags and reeds.</QUOTE> 
   <P>St. George's Fields have not been unvisited by royalty, for we are told that at the happy Restoration, on the <datestruct VALUE="1660-05-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London met Charles II., in his journey from   Dover to London, in St. George's Fields, where a magnificent tent was erected, and the king was provided with a sumptuous banquet before entering the City. 
   <P>These fields, according to Pepys and Evelyn, were <num value="1">one</num> of the places of refuge to which the poorer citizens retreated with such of their goods and chattels as they could save from the fire of London. 
   <P>We read in Evelyn's <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> in September, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.342" n="2000.14.0126"><HEAD>The <QUOTE>Horns</QUOTE> Tavern, Kennington, In <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, that many of the poor people, who had lost their homes in the City, were dispersed about St. George's Fields; <QUOTE>some under miserable huts and hovels, many without a rag or any necessary utensils, bed or board, who from delicatenesse, riches, and easy accommodation in stately and wellfurnished houses, were now reduced to extreamest misery and poverty.</QUOTE> 
   <P>St. George's Fields, down to the commencement of the present century, comprised broad   open meadows, and stretched from   Blackman Street, Borough, to the Kennington Road.   Dirty ditches intersected it, travelling show-vans and wooden huts on wheels were squatted there, and some rusty boilers and pipes rotted by the roadside. They were places, as we read in Malcolm, much resorted to by field-preachers, who, during the reign of the Stuart sovereigns, were not allowed to hold forth in London. 
   <P>Several of the names of the particular plots of land, during the unbuilt state of St. George's Fields, are transmitted to us in old writings, as well as some amusing notices of certain places here, or in the neighbourhood, in scarce books. Among other documents, the parish records of St, <pb id="P.343" n="343"> Saviour's mention Checquer Mead, Lamb Acre, and an estate denominated the Chimney Sweepers, as situated in these fields and belonging to that parish; as also a large laystall, or common dunghill, used by the parishioners, called St. George's Dunghill. The open part, at the commencement of the last and end of the preceding century, like Moorfields, and some other void places near the metropolis, was appropriated to the practice of archery, as we learn from a scarce tract published near the time, called <QUOTE>An Aim for those that shoot in St. George's Fields.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Here were the <QUOTE>Apollo   Gardens</QUOTE> and   the <QUOTE>Dog and Duck,</QUOTE> both standing till the Regency of George IV. In point of fashion they were a direct contrast to Ranelagh, and even to Vauxhall, to which <QUOTE>the quality</QUOTE> repaired. The former stood opposite the Asylum in the Westminster Road, and they were fitted up on the plan of Vauxhall, though on a smaller scale, by a Mr. Clayett. In the centre of the gardens was an orchestra, very large and beautiful. <QUOTE>A   want of the rural accompaniment of fine trees, their small extent, their situation, and other causes, soon made them the resort ot only low and vicious characters   and 
<FIGURE id="Fig.343" n="2000.14.0127"><HEAD>The Freemasons' Charity School, St. George's Fields.   (From An Engraving By Rawle, In <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 after an ineffectual struggle, lasting through <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> seasons, they were finally closed, and the site was built over.</QUOTE> The old orchestra of the gardens, when taken down, was removed to Sydney Gardens, at Bath, to be re-erected there. 
   <P>The <QUOTE>Dog and Duck</QUOTE> grounds were far more obstinate and also far more unworthy of patronage. At this place there was a long room, with tables and benches, and an organ at the upper end, so that in all probability the place was used for <QUOTE>popular concerts.</QUOTE> The audience was composed of the riff-raff and scum of the town. Becoming a public nuisance, the gardens were at length put down by the magistrates, and Bethlehem Hospital now occupies the spot which once they covered. The spot was a noted place of amusement for the lower middle classes; and as the name indicates, it was <num value="1">one</num> of the chief scenes of the brutal diversion of duck-hunting, which was carried on here, less than <num value="2">two</num> centuries ago, in a pond or ponds in the grounds attached to the house. The fun of the sport consisted in seeing the duck make its escape from   the dog's mouth by diving.   It was much practised in the neighbourhood of London till it wys out of fashion, being suiperseded      by pigeony <pb id="P.344" n="344"> shooting, and other pastimes equally cruel. In the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century the place was celebrated for its springs. The <QUOTE>Dog and Duck,</QUOTE> in its later days, bore but a bad repute as a regular haunt of thieves and of other low characters.   After a long existence, during which it frequently figured in connection with trials for highway robbery and other crimes, it was suppressed by the order of the magistrates.   Garrick thus alludes to the tavern and its tea-gardens in his Prologue to the <hi rend=italics>Maid of the Oaks</hi>, <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct> :--

   <P>It will be remembered that <num value="1">one</num> of the best scenes in Hannah More's <QUOTE>Cheapside Apprentice</QUOTE> is laid in the infamous Dog and Duck Fields. 
   <P>The following interesting extract from a MS. by Hone, the author of the <QUOTE>Year-Book,</QUOTE> is printed 
<foreign lang=la>in extenso</foreign> by Mr. Larwood, in his <title>History of Signboards</title>:-- 
   <P> <QUOTE>It (the  <Q>Dog and Duck</Q> ) was a very small public-house till Hedger's mother took it; she had been a barmaid to a tavern-keeper in London, who at his death left her his house.   Her son Hedger was then a postboy to a yard at Epsom, I believe, and came to be master there.   After making a good deal of money, he left the house to his nephew, <num value="1">one</num> Miles, who, though it still went in Hedger's name, was to allow him   <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> a year out of the profits; and it was he that allowed the house to acquire so bad a character that the licence was taken away. I have this from <num value="1">one</num> William Nelson, who was servant to old Mrs. Hedger, and remembers the house before he had it.   He is now (<datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>) in the employ of the Lamb Street Water- Works Company, and has been for <num value="30">thirty</num> years. In particular, there never was any duck-hunting since he knew the gardens; therefore, if ever, it must have been in a very early time indeed. Hedger, I am told, was the <num value="1">first</num> person who sold the water (whence the St. George's Spa). In <datestruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></datestruct>, when Hedger applied for a renewal of his licence, the magistrates of Surrey refused; and the Lord Mayor came into Southwark and held a court, and granted his licence, in despite of the magistrates, which occasioned a great disturbance and litigation in the law courts.</QUOTE> 
   <P>A fort, with <num value="4">four</num> half-bulwarks, at the <QUOTE>Dog and Duck,</QUOTE> in St. George's Fields, is mentioned among the defences of London, set up by order of the Parliament in <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>. 
  <P>The old stone sign of the <QUOTE>Dog and Duck</QUOTE> tea-gardens is still preserved, embedded   in the 
<FIGURE id="Fig.344" n="2000.14.0128"><HEAD>Old Sign Of The <QUOTE>Dog And Duck.</QUOTE> </HEAD></FIGURE>
 brick wall of the garden of Bethlehem Hospital, visible from   the road, and representing a dog squatting on its haunches with a duck in its mouth, and bearing the date   <datestruct value="1617"><year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>A well of water, celebrated for its purgative qualities, formerly existed near the <QUOTE>Dog and Duck</QUOTE> grounds. Dr. Fothergill tells us that this water had gained a reputation for the cure of most cutaneous disorders, in scrofulous cases, and that it was useful for keeping the body cool, and preventing cancerous diseases; but the exact site of this well is no longer known. 
   <P> <QUOTE>St. George's Fields,</QUOTE> as Malcolm informs us, <QUOTE>abounded with gardens, where the lower classes met to drink and smoke tobacco. But those were not their only amusements. A   Mr. Shanks, near Lambeth Marsh, contrived to assemble his customers in <datestruct value="1711--"><year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct> with a grinning match.   The prize was a gold-laced hat; the competitors were exhilarated by music and dancing; the hour of exhibition was <num value="12">twelve</num> at noon; the admission sixpence.   The same was repeated at <num value="6">six</num> o'clock.</QUOTE> 
   <P>A century ago St. George's Fields became the scene of very fierce gatherings of the <QUOTE>Wilkes and Liberty</QUOTE> mobs; and   the populace were very riotous, clamouring for the release of their dissolute and witty favourite from the King's Bench. During the riot which ensued, a young man named William Allen was killed by <num value="1">one</num> of the soldiers. Allen was pursued to the <QUOTE>Horse-shoe Inn,</QUOTE> Stones End, and shot in the inn-yard. He was buried, as we have seen, in the churchyard at Newington,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="263">263</num>.</NOTE> where a monument was erected to his memory. 
   <P>It is not a little strange that the pains-taking and conscientious antiquary, Pennant, though he wrote <pb id="P.345" n="345"> in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, when their memory must have been still fresh, makes no mention of these fields having been the head-quarters of the rioters under Lord George Gordon, who <num value="10">ten</num> years before had wellnigh set fire to all London. He simply speaks of these fields as <QUOTE>now   the wonder of foreigners approaching   our capital by this road, through avenues of lamps of magnificent breadth and goodness.</QUOTE> Whether the <QUOTE>breadth and the goodness</QUOTE> was predicated by Pennant of the <QUOTE>road</QUOTE> or the <QUOTE>lamps</QUOTE> is a little doubtful, more particularly since he refers, in a foot-note, to some new process of adulteration of the oil, and tells the following story almost in the same breath :-- <QUOTE>I have heard that a foreign ambassador, who happened to make his entry at night, imagined that these illuminations were in honour of his arrival, and, as he modestly expressed himself, more than he could have expected!</QUOTE> 
    <P>In previous volumes of this work we have already spoken of the effects of the Gordon Riots in different parts of the metropolis, particularly in the burning of Newgate<NOTE>See Vol. II., p. <num value="442">442</num>.</NOTE>   and the destruction of Lord  Mansfield's house in Bloomsbury Square ;<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="539">539</num>.</NOTE> but as St. George's Fields formed the rallying-point, whence the excited mob was to be led on the  House of Commons, some further particulars of the proceedings of the rioters may not be out of place here. 
    <P>A   so-called   Protestant Association had been formed in <datestruct value="1779--"><year reg="1779">1779</year></datestruct>, for the purpose of opposing Sir  George Savile's bill for the abolition of Roman  Catholic disabilities; and a fanatical Scotch nobleman, Lord George Gordon, <num value="3">third</num> son of William,  Duke of Gordon, then in his thirtieth year, consented to become president of the association, which was fast gaining an influence over the lower classes. Various meetings to arrange for the presentation of a petition to Parliament against the repeal of these disabilities had been held in April and <datestruct VALUE="1780-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, in the <QUOTE>Crown and Rolls Tavern,</QUOTE> Chancery Lane, and in the Coachmakers' Hall, and the presentation was finally agreed upon at  Coachmakers' Hall, on the <datestruct VALUE="-05-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>.   At this meeting, which was attended by upwards of <num value="2000">2,000</num> excited people, under Lord George Gordon's presidency, a petition was then proposed and carried to the following effect:-- 
    <QUOTE REND=blockquote><p>Whereas no hall in London can contain <num value="40000">40,000</num> persons: resolved, that the Association do meet on Friday next, in   St. George's Fields, at <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock in the morning, to consider the most prudent and respectful manner of attending their petition, which will be presented the same day in the   House of Commons. 
   <p>Resolved, for the sake of good order and regularity, that this Association, in coming to the ground, do separate themselves into <num value="4">four</num> distinct divisions: viz., the London division, the Westminster division, the Southvwark division, and the Scotch division. 
   <p>Resolved, that the London division do take place upon the right of the ground towards Southwark, the Westminster division <num value="2">second</num>, the Southwark division <num value="3">third</num>, and the Scotch division upon the left, all wearing blue cockades, to distinguish themselves from the Papists and those who approve of the late set in favour of Popery. 
   <p>Resolved, that the magistrates of London, Westminster, and Southwark be requested to attend, that their presence may overawe and control any riotous or evil-minded persons who may wish to disturb the legal and peaceable deportment of His Majesty's Protestant subjects. 
                  <p>By order of the Association, 
                           <p>Signed, <name rend=caps>G. Gordon</name>, President. 
   <p>Dated. London, <datestruct VALUE="-05-29"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=29>29</day></datestruct>.</QUOTE>

   <P>The enthusiastic and eccentric president then addressed the billowy meeting, informing   them that the system of different divisions would be useful, as he could then go from <num value="1">one</num> to the other, and learn the general opinion as to the mode of taking up the petition. As it was very easy for <num value="1">one</num> person to sign <num value="400">400</num> or <num value="500">500</num> names to a petition, he thought it was better that every <num value="1">one</num> who signed should appear in person to prove that the names were all genuine.   He begged that they would dress decently and behave orderly, and, to prevent riots and to distinguish themselves, they should wear blue cockades in their hats. Some <num value="1">one</num> had suggested that, meeting so early, people might get drinking; but he held that the Protestant Association were not drunken people, and apprehended no danger on that account.   Some <num value="1">one</num> had also hinted that so great a number of people being assembled might lead to the military being drawn out; but he did not doubt all the association would be peaceable and orderly; and he desired them not to take even sticks in their hands, and begged that if there was any riotous person the rest should give him up. 
     <P> <QUOTE>If any <num value="1">one</num> was struck, he was not to return the blow, but seek for a constable. Even if he himself should be at all riotous, he would wish to be given up, for he thought it a proper spirit for Protestants, remembering the text,  <Q>If they smite you on <num value="1">one</num> cheek, turn the other also.</Q>    He concluded by saying that lie hoped no <num value="1">one</num> who had signed would be afraid or ashamed to show himself in the cause; and he begged leave to decline to present the petition unless he was met in St. George's  Fields by <num value="20000">20,000</num> people, with some mark of distinction on, such as a blue ribbon in their hats, so that he might be able to distinguish their friends from their foes. He would not present the petition of a lukewarm   people.   They must be firm, like <pb id="P.346" n="346"> the Scotch, to carry their point. He himself would be there to meet them, and would be answerable for any that were indicted for meeting there; indeed, he wished so well to the cause that he would go to the gallows for it (deafening cheers).</QUOTE> 
   <P>The <QUOTE>true Protestant</QUOTE> rabble, estimated variously at from <num value="40000">40,000</num> to <num value="100000">100,000</num> men, all wearing blue ribbons, some of which   had   the words <QUOTE>No Popery</QUOTE> upon them, met at the appointed day and hour in St. George's Fields--on the very spot, singularly enough, as tradition says, where the high altar of the present Roman Catholic Cathedral is raised : such is the irony of history. Blue banners were flying; and it is said that in the Scotch division bagpipes were playing.   In each of the <num value="4">four</num> divisions the <QUOTE>true Protestants</QUOTE> marched, singing hymns, <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="9">nine</num> abreast, the enormous tree-trunk of a petition being carried on men's heads in a conspicuous part of the procession. They began to advance towards Westminster soon after <num value="12">twelve</num>, <num value="1">one</num> division marching by Blackfriars Bridge, the others by London Bridge and Westminster Bridge.   The march was orderly and decorous; hitherto the passions of these fanatics had been restrained; it was only when the rabble joined, and a sense of new-felt power came over them, that they turned to wild beasts. When they reached the Houses of Parliament, about half-past <num value="2">two</num>, the <QUOTE>true Protestants</QUOTE> gave such a shout as that before which fell the walls of the fated Jericho. Gibbon, the historian, then a member of the House of Commons, describes the scene <QUOTE>as if <num value="40000">40,000</num> Puritans of the days of Cromwell had started from their graves.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In Boswell's <QUOTE>Life of Johnson</QUOTE> we read that just when the great doctor was engaged in preparing a delightful literary entertainment for the world, <QUOTE>the tranquillity of the metropolis of Great Britain was unexpectedly disturbed by the most horrid series of outrages that ever disgraced a civilised country.   A   relaxation of some of the severe penal provisions against our fellow-subjects of the Catholic communion had been granted by the legislature, with an opposition so inconsiderable, that the genuine mildness of Christianity, united with liberal policy, seemed to have become general in this island. But a dark and malignant spirit of persecution soon showed itself in an unworthy petition for the repeal of the wise and humane statute. That petition was brought forward by a mob, with the evident purpose of intimidation, and was justly rejected.   But the attempt was accompanied and followed by such daring violence as is unexampled in history.</QUOTE> Of this extraordinary tumult, Dr. Johnson has given the following concise, lively, and just account in his <QUOTE>Letters to Mrs. Thrale :</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>On Friday the good Protestants met in Saint George's Fields, at the summons of Lord George Gordon, and, marching to Westminster, insulted the Lords and Commons, who all bore it with great tameness. At night the outrages began by the demolition of the mass-house by Lincoln's Inn.   An   exact journal of a week's defiance of government I cannot give you.   On Monday, Mr. Strahan, who had been insulted, spoke to Lord Mansfield (who had, I think, been insulted too) of the licentiousness of the populace; and his lordship treated it as a very slight irregularity. On Tuesday night they pulled down Fielding's house, and burnt his goods in the street. They had gutted, on Monday, Sir George Savile's house, but the building was saved. On Tuesday evening, leaving Fielding's ruins, they went to Newgate to demand their companions who had been seized demolishing   the chapel. The keeper could not release them   but by the Mayor's permission, which he went to ask; at his return he found all the prisoners released and Newgate in a blaze. They then went to Bloomsbury, and fastened upon Lord Mansfield's house, which they pulled down, and as for his goods they totally burnt them. They have since gone to Caen Wood, but a guard was there before them. They plundered some Papists, and burnt a mass-house in Moorfields the same night.</QUOTE> Boswell speaks of these riots as <QUOTE>a miserable sedition, from which London was delivered by the magnanimity of the sovereign himself.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Miss Priscilla Wakefield, in her <QUOTE>Perambulations in London,</QUOTE> writes as follows concerning these riotous proceedings :-- <QUOTE>The metropolis was thrown into a dreadful consternation, in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, by a lawless mob, which caused the most alarming scenes of riot and confusion.   On the <datestruct VALUE="-06-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct> an immense multitude assembled   in St. George's Fields, in consequence of an advertisement from the Protestant Association, in order to proceed to the House of Commons with a petition for the repeal of the law passed the last session in favour of the Roman Catholics.   Lord George Gordon condescended to be their leader. They preserved tolerable order till they approached the Houses of Parliament, when they showed their hostile disposition by ill-treating many of the members as they passed along. Lord George encouraged these proceedings by haranguing this tumultuous assembly from the lgallery-stairs of the House of Commons, and telling them   that they were not likely to succeed in their request, to which he added the imprudence of naming the members who opposed it. Some of them, ripe for active mischief, filed <pb id="P.347" n="347"> off, and demolished the chapels belonging to the Sardinian and Bavarian ambassadors. The guards being called out, <num value="13">thirteen</num> of the rioters were taken into custody. All remained quiet till Sunday, the <num value="4">4th</num>, when riotous parties collected in the neighbourhood of Moorfields, and satiated their vengeance on the chapels and dwelling-houses of the Catholics. The next day different parts of the town presented a repetition of the same disgraceful scenes; and in the evening an attempt was made to rescue the rioters confined in Newgate, which, from the firmness of Mr. Akerman, the keeper, they were unable to execute, till, by breaking the windows, battering the entrances of the cells with pick-axes and sledge-hammers, and climbing the walls with ladders, they found means to fire Mr. Akerman's house, which communicated to the prison, and liberated <num value="300">three hundred</num> prisoners.   This success increased their fury. They divided into different quarters, with   the   most mischievous designs. Many were great sufferers from their attacks; but none in whose loss the public was so   much interested as Lord Mansfield, in whose house they not only destroyed a great deal of property, and a valuable collection   of pictures, but likewise some very scarce manuscripts, besides his lordship's notes on the constitution of England and on important law cases, which, from his advanced age, could never be replaced.   The occurrences of Wednesday were still more dreadful.   The city was in a state of anarchy; and   the evening presented a most awful scene.   Flames issued on all sides. The insurgents had set fire to the King's Bench and Fleet prisons, New Bridewell, the toilgates on Blackfriars Bridge, and private houses in all directions. The civil magistrate had no longer any power. The military were obliged to act to preserve the metropolis from   destruction.   All parts of the town, particularly those near the Bank and the Court, were guarded by soldiery.   Multitudes perished by intoxication, &amp;c.</QUOTE> It might be added that the Marshalsea was broken open by the mob on this occasion. 
   <P>Mr. H. Angelo, in his <QUOTE>Reminiscences,</QUOTE> thus writes :-- <QUOTE>I soon hurried away, and arrived near the obelisk in St. George's Fields, the space before the King's Bench being then quite open, with no houses.   On seeing the flames and smoke from the windows along the high wall, it appeared to me like the huge hulk of a man-of-war, dismasted, on fire.   Here, with amazement, I stood for some time, gazing on the spot, when, looking behind me, I beheld a number of horse and foot soldiers approach, with a quick step. Off I went, in an instant, in a contrary direction; nor did I look back till I was on Blackfriars Bridge.   That night, if my recollection be correct, must have been the time when the dreadful conflagrations in different parts of the metropolis took place. I recollect it was said that <num value="6">six</num>-and-<num value="30">thirty</num> fires might be seen blazing from London Bridge. When the bridge was assailed by the mob, the latter were repulsed by Alderman Wilkes and his party, and many were thrown clean into the Thames.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Horace Walpole sarcastically calls these riotous proceedings <QUOTE>the <num value="2">second</num> conflagration of London, by Lord George Gordon.</QUOTE> The number of persons who perished in these riots could not be accurately gathered. According to the military returns,  <num value="210">210</num> persons died by shot or sword in the streets, and <num value="75">75</num> in the hospitals; and <num value="173">173</num> were wounded and captured.   How many died of injuries, unknown and unseen, cannot be computed.   Many more perished in the flames, or died from excesses of <num value="1">one</num> kind or other. Justice came in at the close, to demand her due.   At the Old Bailey, eightyfive persons were tried for taking part in the riots, and finally out of these eighteen were executed, <num value="1">one</num> woman, a negress, being of the number.   By a Special Commission for the County of Surrey <num value="45">forty-five</num> prisoners were tried, and <num value="26">twenty-six</num> of them capitally convicted, though <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> were reprieved. 
    <P>But what, it has been asked, did Lord George  Gordon all this while? <QUOTE>Filled with consternation at the riots,</QUOTE> as his counsel on trial said, <QUOTE>he, on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, the terrible Wednesday, sought an audience of the king, professing that it would be of service in checking the riots. No doubt the poor young nobleman would have asked the king to proclaim the intention of repealing the Relief  Bill, as if such a step would have had the slightest effect.   But the king told him <num value="1">first</num> to go and prove his loyalty by checking the riots, if he could.  Lord George did really go into the City; but the   <Q>President of the Protestant Association</Q>  was now powerless, and does not seem even to have spoken to the mobs.</QUOTE> Every reader of <title>Barnaby Rudge</title>
knows the fearful state of London during the continuance of these riots; and <num value="1">one</num> act of Lord  George, in his presumed attempt to quell the tumult, is particularly referred to by the author of that work.   A young man came to the door of his coach, and besought his lordship to sign a paper drawn up for the purpose, which ran thus :-- <QUOTE>All true friends to the Protestants, I hope, will be particular, and do no injury to the property of any true Protestant, as I am well assured the proprietor of this house is a staunch and worthy friend to the cause.</QUOTE> It has been insinuated that Lord <pb id="P.348" n="348"> George Gordon wrote for friends many protectionpapers like this, the language of which certainly implies a knowledge and approval of the intent to attack those who were considered enemies. But the young man proved that it was written by himself, and that Lord George signed it hurriedly in compassion. When shown to the mob, it saved the man's house. 
   <P>Lord George was arrested on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, and conveyed to the Tower under a strong guard. The Government thought it prudent to allow <num value="8">eight</num> months to elapse before trying him, and he was then acquitted; though it seems strange that the ringleader should have been absolved from blame, when a score of his poor dupes were executed for their subordinate share in this bloody work. 
   <P>Some time after this event a person begging alms from him in the street remarked, <QUOTE>God bless you, my lord! you and I have been in all the prisons in   London.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>What do you mean, fellow?</QUOTE> cried Lord George; <QUOTE>I never was in any prison but the Tower.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>That's true, my lord,</QUOTE> replied the sturdy beggar; <QUOTE>and I've been in all the rest.</QUOTE> 
  <P>In <datestruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct> Lord George Gordon coolly wished to offer himself as a candidate for the representation of London, but he withdrew, on finding that the City did not choose to be burnt down once a year for his amusement. 
  <P>The after-life of this nobleman was marked by vagaries which confirmed the probability of his being really afflicted with insanity. In <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct> he openly embraced the Jewish faith, and soon after was convicted of a libel on the Queen of France. He fled to escape the sentence, but was re-taken in a few months and confined in Newgate, where he lived until fever cut short his career on the Ist of <datestruct VALUE="1793-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, at the age of <num value="42">forty-two</num>. He was much beloved by the prisoners, and with good reason, being generous and humane. <num value="2">Two</num> Jewish maid-servants, partly through enthusiasm, waited on him daily up to his death. The last words of Lord George Gordon were characteristic.   The French Revolution had attracted him as a glorious event, and he died crazily chanting its watchword,

    <P>Northouck, writing in <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>, anticipates the early arrival of a day when St. George's Fields will no more resemble fields, but be covered with buildings, as an ultimate consequence of the erection of Westminster and Blackfriars Bridges.   He was right. In the course of the next <num value="2">two</num> decades of years, the hand of the builder had been at work, and streets and terraces were fast rendering the name of St. George's Fields but a meaningless title. 
   <P>The pleasant and open aspect of St. George's Fields, and indeed the whole neighbourhood of the Kent Road, at the above-mentioned date, and it may, perhaps, be added the moderate price of the land, induced the locality to be selected as the site of several charitable institutions. Foremost among them was the Magdalen Hospital, which for just a century stood near the southern end of Blackfriars Road. It was originally opened, under the name of Magdalen House, by the founders, Robert Dingley and Jonas Hanway, in a large building, formerly the London Infirmary, in Prescott Street, Goodman's Fields, in <datestruct value="1758--"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>.   The good founders were readily assisted by others, and the fame of the institution even reached to Calcutta; and Omichund, the rich native merchant, who figures conspicuously in the history of Warren Hastings, left more than <num value="18000">18,000</num> rupees to the funds of the hospital, though, we are sorry to add, his executors contrived to seize and appropriate to themselves the greater portion of the sum. 
   <P>Jonas Hanway's larger schemes of benevolence have connected his name not only with the Marina Society and the Foundling, but also with the Magdalen; and to his courage and perseverance in smaller fields of usefulness (his determined contention with extravagant veils to servants not the least), the men of Goldsmith's day, as we have seen in our account of Hanway Street,<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="471">471</num>.</NOTE> were indebted for liberty to use an umbrella. 
   <P>At home no <num value="1">one</num> was more zealous in support of the Magdalen than Dr. Dodd, the fashionable preacher, who was its chaplain, and whose unlucky exit from this world of trouble at Tyburn we have already mentioned.<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="193">193</num>.</NOTE>   The doctor, we are informed, was unrivalled in his power of extracting tears and loose cash from his fair hearers, and appealed so effectually in <num value="2">two</num> sermons, that the fashionable ladies, sympathising, perhaps, with female frailty, contributed liberally. The charity was incorporated in <datestruct value="1769--"><year reg="1769">1769</year></datestruct>, and <num value="6">six</num> and a half acres in St. George's Fields purchased, on which a new hospital was erected. Accordingly, the hospital is called <QUOTE>The New Magdalen</QUOTE> in the <QUOTE>Ambulator,</QUOTE> in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>The character of this excellent institution is well described in the will of Mr. Charles Wray, who was for many years a governor of the hospital. <QUOTE>I bequeath to the Magdalen Hospital   <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> as a farewell token of my affection, and of my sincere good wishes for the everlasting success and prosperity of that humane and truly Christian institution, which, from   my own knowledge, founded on many years' experience, and beyond my most <pb id="P.349" n="349"> sanguine expectations, hath restored a great number of unfortunate young women to their afflicted parents and friends, to honest industry, to virtue, and to happiness.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Thousands of young women who have strayed from   the paths of virtue have been admitted, restored to their friends, or placed in service; and it is an invariable rule that no female shall be discharged, unless at her own desire or for misconduct, until means have been provided by which she may obtain an honest livelihood. No recom mendation is necessary to entitle the unfortunate to the benefits of this hospital more than that o repentant guilt. 
   <P>The hospital consisted of <num value="4">four</num> brick buildings forming a quadrangle. The chapel belonging t( the institution was an octangular building, erectec at <num value="1">one</num> of the back corners. In the year <datestruct value="1869"><year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct> the institution was removed to Streatham, as we hav( already seen.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="318">318</num>.</NOTE>   The unhappy women, for whose benefit this hospital was erected, are received bj petition; and there is a distinction in the wards according to the education or the behaviour of the

 persons admitted, the inferior wards consisting of meaner persons and of those degraded for their behaviour.   Each person is employed in such kind of work as is suitable to her abilities, and has such part of the benefits arising from her industry as the committee think proper.   Allen, in his <QUOTE>History of Surrey,</QUOTE> in dealing with the Magdalen Hospital (and the description so far is applicable to it in its new situation, as well as when it stood in St. George's Fields), writes :-- <QUOTE>A probationary ward is instituted for the young women on their admission, and a separation of those of different descriptions and qualifications is established. Each class is entrusted to its particular assistant, and the whole is under the inspection of a matron.   This separation, useful on many accounts, is particularly so to a numerous class of women, who are much to be pitied, and to whom   this charity has been very beneficial, namely,  <Q>young women who have been seduced from their friends under promise of marriage, and have been deserted by their seducers.</Q>  Their relations, in the <num value="1">first</num> moments of resentment, refuse to receive, protect, or acknowledge them; they are abandoned by the world, without character, without friends, without money, without resource; <pb id="P.350" n="350"> and wretched indeed is their situation! To such especially this house of refuge opens wide its doors; and instead of being driven by despair to lay violent hands on themselves, and to superadd the crime of self-murder to that guilt which is the cause of their distress, they find a safe and quiet retreat in this abode of peace and reflection.</QUOTE>

    <P>A large block of Peabody Buildings now covers the site of the old Magdalen. The trees which stood in front of the latter are still made to do duty by screening the windows which front the street. 
    <P>Shortly after the foundation of the Magdalen, another valuable institution, the <LEMMA id="lemma.350.3">Asylum for Female Orphans</LEMMA>, was established, principally through the exertions of Sir John Fielding, the active magistrate, and St. George's Fields was chosen for its site.   Like the Magdalen, this institution   has migrated further into the country, having within the last few years taken up its quarters at Bedington --the fine old Elizabethan dwelling-house of the Carews-near Croydon.   While the Foundling Hospital is limited to the reception of infants, the Asylum for Female Orphans has been founded for the reception of destitute children, who are admitted at a more advanced age. The children are educated and industriously employed until sufficiently old to be apprenticed out, when the utmost care is taken that they are provided with suitable situations.   The Asylum   stood originally at the junction of Kennington Road and Westminster Bridge Road, on the spot now covered by Christ Church. The old building formed <num value="3">three</num> sides of a square, but its dimensions appeared contracted, and not of that commanding character expected from the celebrity of this charity. 
   <P><LEMMA id="lemma.350.4">The Royal Freemasons' Charity School for Girls</LEMMA>, in Elizabeth Place, Westminster Bridge Road, of which we give an illustration on page <num value="343">343</num>, was founded about the commencement of the present century, for the maintenance and education of the daughters and orphans of decayed members of the Masonic body. The schools were removed a few years ago, to make room for improvements in the neighbourhood. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct> the Philanthropic Society established an industrial school in St. George's Fields, for the rescue of young children from a career of crime. The <num value="1">first</num> place of reception of the Philanthropic Society was at a small house on Cambridge Heath, but the prosperous encouragement it received induced the directors to contract with the Corporation of London for a piece of ground in the London Road, at the corner of Garden Row, not far from the Obelisk; and on this site it remained till about the year <datestruct value="1850"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>, when the operations of the society were transferred to a more convenient building near the Red Hill station of the Brighton Railway.

   <P>The London Road, which forms a continuation of the Blackfriars Road to the <QUOTE>Elephant and Castle</QUOTE> tavern, may be dismissed with <num value="1">one</num> remark.

   <P>Besides witnessing the events mentioned above as having occurred here, St. George's Fields have borne their share of celebrity in the annals of England.   They were very often the scenes of royal pomp and knightly cavalcades, as well as the rendezvous of rebellion and discord.   It was to this place that Wat Tyler's and Jack Cade's rebels resorted, in order to raise the standard of opposition to the royal authority; and it was hither that the former retired, after the arrest of their leader in Smithfield, and were compelled to yield to the allegiance which they had violated. 
   <P>The <QUOTE>fields</QUOTE> are now   entirely covered with streets and spacious roads.   From   each of the bridges-Westminster, Waterloo, and Blackfriarsbroad thoroughfares converge to a point, about a mile distant from the river, at what is now called

   <P>In the centre of the circus is an <LEMMA id="lemma.351.1">obelisk</LEMMA>, erected in <datestruct value="1771--"><year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct>, during the mayoralty and in honour of Brass Crosby, Esq., who is stated by Allen, in his <QUOTE>History of Surrey,</QUOTE> to have been imprisoned in the Tower <QUOTE>for the conscientious discharge of his <pb id="P.351" n="351"> magisterial duty,</QUOTE> and to commemorate the independent and patriotic spirit with which he released a printer who had been seized, contrary to law, by the House of Commons.

<P>Modern <QUOTE>Bedlam</QUOTE> , to which we now come in our progress over St. George's Fields, is a very different place from the <QUOTE>Hospital of the Star of Bethlehem</QUOTE> to which it claims to have succeeded, and of which we will proceed to give a history. It is vulgarly styled <QUOTE>Bedlam,</QUOTE> by a corruption of <QUOTE>Bethlem,</QUOTE> which again is an abbreviation of <QUOTE>Bethlehem.</QUOTE> 
   <P>It was in the year   <datestruct value="1246"><year reg="1246">1246</year></datestruct>, and therefore in the reign of Henry III., that Simon Fitz-Mary, then Sheriff of London, made a pious determination to establish the <QUOTE>Priory of the Star of Bethlehem ;</QUOTE> and in order to endow it with sufficient maintenance, gave up those lands of his which were in the parish of St. Botolph Without, Bishopsgate, in the spot now known as Liverpool Street; the priory itself standing on the east side of <QUOTE>Morefield,</QUOTE> afterwards called <QUOTE>Old Bethlem.</QUOTE> In the year <datestruct value="1330"><year reg="1330">1330</year></datestruct> the religious house became known as a public hospital; the City of London took it under their protection (an advantage to the establishment which, in those days of disorder, was not the least desirable object to attain), and in <datestruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct> they purchased all the patronage, lands, and tenements belonging to the establishment; upon which Henry VIII., who perhaps happened to be short of money at the time, wished to make them pay for the house itself; but finding that they would not become purchasers of what really belonged to themselves, if to anybody at all, the magnanimous monarch took a liberal alternative, and made them a present of the house. The common story is that the king generously gave it to the <QUOTE>citizens of London,</QUOTE> as a hospital for lunatics, whom he did not like to have so near to him as Charing Cross; just as the conscience of the king led him to build the church of St. Martin's in the Fields, because he did not like to see so many funerals pass on the way to Westminster. 
    <P>The old priory had already been a hospital for lunatics, amongst whom   there were certain outpensioners known as <QUOTE>Tom o&lsquo; Bedlams,</QUOTE> who were relieved and then sent away to beg, being known by a metal badge fastened on the arm: a distinction, of course, often simulated by other mendicants.  In <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct> the building had become so dilapidated <pb id="P.352" n="352"> that it became necessary to erect a new <num value="1">one</num>, and this was done upon a new site on the south side of Moorfields, at a cost of <measure value="1700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1700">1,700</num></measure>, raised by subscription.   Of the appearance of this building at the commencement of the present century, or down to the time of the removal of this institution to St. George's Fields about the year <datestruct value="1815"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, we have spoken in a previous part of this work;<NOTE>See Vol. II., p. <num value="200">200</num>.</NOTE>   it only remains, therefore, to state that the edifice which was erected in Moorfields in <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct> having in its turn fallen into a bad condition, and becoming gradually surrounded by narrow streets, and crowded houses, its site was exchanged for a much larger piece of open ground in St. George's Fields.   In the 
<hi rend=italics>Monthly Register</hi> for <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct> we read that, <QUOTE>according to a new City plan for building on Moorfields, Bethlehem   Hospital is to be pulled down, and reerected on a more convenient site near Islington.</QUOTE> This plan, however, was not carried out. 
   <P><LEMMA id="lemma.352.1">The present edifice</LEMMA> was erected in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, but various additions have since been made.   The building is <num value="3">three</num> storeys high, and has a frontage of about <num value="900">900</num> feet in length. It covers, with the offices and gardens, about <num value="15">fifteen</num> acres of ground. 
   <P>The <QUOTE><num value="1">first</num> stone</QUOTE> of the new building was laid by the Lord Mayor in <datestruct VALUE="1812-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, and it was erected from the designs and under the direction of James Lewis, architect. The hospital was in <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct> sufficiently advanced for the reception of patients. The cupola, or dome, a comparatively recent addition, which crowns the centre of the roof, and serves as the chapel, was designed by the late Mr. Sydney Smirke. 
   <P>The cost of the erection was about <measure value="122500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="122500">122,500</num></measure>, of which <measure value="72819l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="72819">72,819</num></measure> was granted by Parliament at different times, and <num value="10229">10,229</num> subscribed by public bodies and private individuals. The Corporation of the City gave <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure>, and the Bank of England <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> towards this sum. The following anecdote, with reference to the above-mentioned subscription, is told in the <hi rend=italics>Youth's Magazine</hi> for <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct> :-- <QUOTE>When the   collection was making to build Bethlehem Hospital, those who were employed to gather donations for that purpose went to a small house, the door of which being half open, they overheard an old man, the master, scolding his servant-maid for having thrown away a brimstone-match without using both ends. After diverting themselves some time with the dispute, they presented themselves before the old man, and explained the cause of their coming, though, from what had just passed, they entertained very little, if any, hopes of success. The supposed miser, however, no sooner understood the business, than he stepped into a closet, whence he brought a bag, and counted out <num value="400">four hundred</num> guineas, which he gave to them.   No astonishment could exceed that of the collectors at this unexpected reverse of their expectations; they loudly testified their surprise, and scrupled not to inform their benefactor that they had overheard his quarrel with the servant-girl.    <Q>Gentlemen,</Q>  said he,  <Q>your surprise is occasioned by a thing of very little consequence. I keep house, and save and spend money my own way; the <num value="1">first</num> furnishes me with the means of doing the other. With regard to benefactions and donations, you may always expect most from prudent people who keep their own accounts.</Q>    When he had thus spoken he requested them to withdraw without the smallest ceremony, to prevent which he shut the door, not thinking half so much of the <num value="400">four hundred</num> guineas which he had just given away as of the match which had been carelessly thrown in the fire.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The <num value="1">first</num> hospital in Moorfields could accommodate only <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num> patients; and the <num value="2">second</num> only <num value="150">150</num>, the number immured there in Strype's time. The present building was originally constructed for <num value="198">198</num> patients, but this being found too limited for the purposes and resources of the hospital, a new wing was commenced for   <num value="166">166</num> additional patients, of which the <num value="1">first</num> stone was laid in <datestruct VALUE="1838-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>.   Since then other portions of the premises have been considerably enlarged. 
   <P>Light iron railings, together with an entrancegateway and lodge-house, separate the grounds from the main road. Let into a brick wall, which cuts off from observation the private grounds in front of the hospital, is the old sign-stone of the <QUOTE>Dog and Duck</QUOTE> tavern (shown in page <num value="344">344</num>), which, as we have stated in the preceding chapter, formerly occupied this site.   The sign, which is about a yard square, is cut in high relief, and represents a dog with a duck in its mouth. 
   <P>It must be owned that the long line of brick frontage of the hospital is somewhat sombre and gloomy in appearance. It consists of a centre and <num value="2">two</num> wings. The former has a handsome and lofty portico, raised on a flight of steps, and composed of <num value="6">six</num> columns of the Ionic order, surmounted by their entablature and a pediment, in the tympanum of which is a relief of the royal arms, and underneath   the motto:--<QUOTE lang=la><emph rend=caps>Henrico   VIII., Rege fundatum   civium   largitas perfecit</emph></QUOTE>.   (<GLOSS>Founded by King Henry VIII.; completed by the bounty of the people.</GLOSS>)   The remainder of the central portion of the building is occupied by the apartments of the officers of the establishment, the council-chamber, &amp;c. On either <pb id="P.353" n="353"> side of the entrance-hall are the houses assigned to the <num value="2">two</num> resident physicians, who, of course, are men who have studied lunacy in all its bearings, both in theory and in practice. If surgical aid of a special nature is required, a surgeon is summoned from St. Thomas's Hospital or Guy's. The hospital has also accommodation for <num value="2">two</num> medical students who wish to qualify themselves for practice in lunacy; and these <num value="2">two</num> studentships, which give each of their holders free maintenance and instruction for <num value="6">six</num> months, are eagerly sought after. 
   <P>The wings are in <num value="3">three</num> storeys, in addition to a rusticated basement, which show uniformly grated windows. Behind the principal front are <num value="2">two</num> other wings, with the culinary departments between them. In the vestibule were for years preserved the <num value="2">two</num> statues of <QUOTE>Melancholy and Raving Madness,</QUOTE> which were sculptured by the elder Cibber, and formerly surmounted the gates of the old hospital in Moorfields.   They are of Portland stone, and have been long since removed to the Museum at South Kensington.   These statues were repaired by Bacon in <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>. In Lambert's <QUOTE>History of London</QUOTE> there is an engraving of Gibber's <QUOTE>Brainless Brothers,</QUOTE> as these statues have been called: a fine piece of design, though the idea is borrowed from Michael Angelo.   Virtue has preserved an anecdote that <num value="1">one</num> of them was copied from Oliver Cromwell's gigantic porter, who became insane. 
    <P>On entering the grand hall, the eye of the visitor is immediately attracted by the spacious staircase, which ascends from the ground-floor to the councilchamber above.   On either side passages run laterally through the building, the <num value="1">one</num> to the right leading to the male, the other to the female wards.  The basement and <num value="3">three</num> floors are each divided into galleries. The basement gallery is paved with stone, and its ceiling arched with brickwork; the upper galleries are floored with wood, and the ceiling plated with iron. <num value="1">One</num> is struck on entering the female wards, not so much with the exquisite cleanliness of everything as with the air of taste and refinement which may be met with on either hand.   The wards are long galleries, lighted on <num value="1">one</num> side by large windows, in each of which stand globes of fish, fern-cases, or green-house plants; while the spaces between are occupied by pictures, busts, or cages containing birds. The whole air of the place is light and cheerful; and although there is, of course, sad evidence of the purposes of the institution in some of the faces, as they sit brooding over the guarded fires which warm the corridors at intervals of about <num value="50">fifty</num> yards, there is a large per-centage of inmates who look for the most part cheerful, and are either working at some business, reading, writing, or playing with the cats or parrots, which seem wisely to be allowed to them as pets. 
   <P> <QUOTE>I visited Bethlehem   Hospital, or, as   it is called,  <Q>Bedlam,</Q>  which inspired me,</QUOTE> writes the Viscomte D&lsquo;Arlingcourt, in <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>with   melancholy thoughts.   I beheld this noble establishment with mingled admiration and grief. Its galleries, seemingly of interminable extent, are magnificent, but peopled with lunatics, whose sadness or gaiety appear equally fearful. Confined in a double prison, mentally as well as bodily, without light, without hope, and without end, the unfortunate inmates struggle at the same time under a twofold condemnation. It is true that the prisoners in Bedlam have not, like those in Newgate, to endure the tortures of memory and remorse; but even those in Newgate might have, if they would, an advantage over those in Bedlam--namely, the power of fixing their thoughts on heaven. These last would thus have still a hope left; the captive lunatic has none; he is not even on a level with dumb animals, for instinct likewise has forsaken him. He no longer ranks among men, and he is separated by nature from the brute creation. In <num value="1">one</num> of the apartments in Bedlam is a portrait of Henry VIII., painted by Holbein; his disagreeable countenance   consists of a screwed--up mouth, a bushy beard, a short nose, small eyes, and a puffy face.   This Bluebeard of the English throne, this royal slayer of women, appeared   to   me in   his proper place at Bedlam.   But, alas! he himself was not confined there.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Turning again to the unfortunate objects of this institution, their case is thus powerfully depicted, or rather prophesied, by Gray, in   his <title>Ode to  Eton College</title>:--

 <pb id="P.354" n="354"> 
   <P>Threading our way along the corridor which leads to the female wards, and descending a stone staircase, we were led by our guide to the kitchen and culinary offices in the basement, and in the rear of the central portion of the building. The kitchen is a large octagonal building, admirably furnished, and fitted up with huge boilers, a large steam apparatus, and all the requisite appliances for cooking. The water used by the establishment is drawn from an Artesian well, which is bored down into the chalk underlying the clay soil. Hence probably arises the   well-known freedom   from diarrhcea and cholera among the inmates of Bethlehem when those terrible diseases have raged all around the walls of the institution. 
   <P>Near at hand, and in other parts of the grounds, are the workshops, where those patients who, from their previous employment, are qualified for the task, may be seen labouring, with more or less industry, at their respective trades.   Those who can work at any sedentary employment are encouraged to do so: not the slightest restriction, however, is placed upon the inmates on this score; anrd there are but few whose demeanour is violent 
<FIGURE id="Fig.354" n="2000.14.0130"><HEAD>Bethlehem Hospital.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 enough to require more rigid measures. Thanks to Dr. Elliotson,<NOTE>See Vol IV., p. <num value="325">325</num>.</NOTE> the great modern reformer of the system   on which lunatics are treated in this country, all severity-such as the use of chains, manacles, and strait-waistcoats--has now entirely disappeared here; indeed, if a patient on being brought to the hospital should happen to be wearing <num value="1">one</num>, it is stripped off in the hall, and handed back to the patient's friends, often much to their surprise. Kindness is the only charm by which the attendants exert a mastery over the patients, and the influence thus possessed is most remarkable. 
   <P>The ground-floor of the main building receives the patients on their admission, and this and the succeeding storey are appropriated for dangerous cases. Here, too, are the bath-rooms, lavatories, and sundry rooms, padded with cork and indiarubber, for the reception of refractory and violent patients. 
   <P><num value="1">One</num> of the inmates of the <num value="1">first</num> ward which we visited talked as rationally and sensibly as possible on the subject of her former pupils when she kept <pb id="P.355" n="355"> a ladies' school; and nobody could have suspected her of being a <QUOTE>patient</QUOTE> here, had we not known that there was <num value="1">one</num> subject on which it was forbidden to speak.   Another poor woman, though cheerful and even smiling, lived-we were toldunder the constant delusion that she hears the workmen erecting the scaffold for her execution on the morrow. A <num value="3">third</num>, a handsome woman of about <num value="50">fifty</num>, on seeing us enter, came forward to see if we were part of the nuptial party whom she was daily expecting in attendance on her heavenly spouse, the Lord himself, and his companion, the prophet Isaiah! Her disappointment on perceiving her mistake we cannot pretend to describe. <QUOTE>Well, I know he will come before the end of the year. He is very kind and good to me; and I am not worthy of him.</QUOTE> Such were her musings. Poor, good, simple soul! how we felt for the pain which we had unintentionally caused her, as she retired into a corner to sit down and weep; while an aged crone, near her, gave vent to a torrent of abuse of the institution! Another girl was pointed out to us, who sat, and sits day by day, in a dark corner, watching a favourite plant, which she is persuaded will bring her a blessing as soon as it comes into flower. Poor girl! how true, again, are the words of Gray-

<FIGURE id="Fig.355" n="2000.14.0131"><HEAD><title>Melancholy   And   Raving   Madness</title>.   (Sculptured By   Cibber.)        (Formerly Over The Gateway Of Bethlehenm Hospital, Moorfields.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
    <P>Passing up the stone staircases, we made our way through the various rooms on each floor of the southern wing.   Each we found to be furnished with plain couches and lounges, and almost every other comfort which could in any way conduce to the comfort of the wretched inmates. In several of the wards were pianos. At the end of the uppermost floor, in this part of the building, is a ball-room, the sight of which would have gratified Lord Lanesborough;<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="4">4</num>.</NOTE> in it a ball is given every month, and a practice-night also is held fortnightly. The dancers are those of the patients who are fit to be trusted. 
    <P>A writer in the <hi rend=italics>Illustrated Times</hi> most appositely remarks:-- <QUOTE>An empty ball-room, whether at Bethlehem   or elsewhere, can be but a spacious, well-ventilated, well-boarded, and handsome saloon. But the ball! Ah, those periodical balls at Bethlehem   Hospital!-who can describe, who imagine them--their strange, pervading   characteristics; their underlying peculiarities; their effects; the longing anticipations of the relief they must afford by recalling old memories half-submerged in the darker broodings which sometimes flood the recollections of a brighter life? Oh! may they help those poor souls to grope their way back to life and light.</QUOTE> <pb id="P.356" n="356"> 
    <P>In the corresponding wing on the men's side is a billiard-room, to which the most hopeful cases among the male patients have access under certain restrictions. This is a large apartment, which, but for its furniture, would look like an immense and lofty green-house, since it is almost entirely glazed above the height of about <num value="6">six</num> feet--a plan which ensures a capital light upon the table. Around the room   are raised cushioned seats for those who desire to watch the play; while nearer the fire a large study-table is filled with magazines, journals, and general literature, in neat, lettered covers, and all uninjured by the stains which ordinarily mark these adjuncts to a public room. 
    <P>Each of the sleeping-rooms contains a low truckle bedstead, with chair and table, light and air being admitted through a small barred window at the top. Some of them, particularly on the women's side of the hospital, are profusely adorned with pictures and other objects of interest, which may have been   left by friends visiting the patient.  Each door opens to the gallery, affording a promenade <num value="250">250</num> feet in length, where the patients can walk about when the weather proves unfavourable for out-door exercise. To the left of the gallery is the dining-room, capable of accommodating about  <num value="100">100</num> persons. The diet, which is plain, but of the best kind, is served on wooden bowls and platters, and is seldom unaccompanied by a good appetite.  The patients are allowed the use of knives, but these, we remarked, were very blunt. 
   <P>These long corridors or wards are preserved to an equable temperature through every change of season by the introduction of warm-air pipes and stoves beneath the flooring, so constructed that the warmth of every patient's room can be regulated. 
   <P>The wards of the women, as already stated, are much more gay and cheerful than those in the men's wing. Their windows are nearly all decked out with evergreens or other plants and flowers, and the prints on the walls have flowers or needlework hung upon them--the latter the work of the patients. Some of these ply the needle as deftly as their saner sisters. <num value="1">One</num> in particular, a girl of about <num value="17">seventeen</num>, who has the reputation of being an excellent darner, showed us her handy-work with great pride, and was evidently delighted by our praise. 
   <P>Each storey has connected with it <num value="1">one</num> of these galleries, from the last of which a stone staircase conducts to the chapel, a large octagonal apartment covered with a cupola, but of no architectural pretensions, which stands over the central hall. Such of the patients as can be trusted to behave themselves attend service in it twice on a Sunday, the men sitting on <num value="1">one</num> side and the women on the other, each attended by their keepers and attendants. The chaplain generally addresses them in a conversational and homely manner, instead of inflicting on them   a written   sermon; and the patients themselves form a very fair choir. They have a good organ to aid them in their psalmody. 
   <P>Beyond the gallery a door opens into a light, airy, and cheerful room, the beds in which, and the air of calm quiet pervading it, prepare you to hear that it is the infirmary ward. Here, once more, we meet with exquisite cleanliness, but still something beyond cleanliness-comfort, elegance, even luxury. The high and neatly-curtained windows admit the light in <num value="1">one</num> pleasant tone, without either glare or shadow, and show flowers, plants, busts, and even the neat white-draped beds, all as pleasant objects.   Seated here and there are the partially convalescent, accommodated with easy seats, leg-rests, or pillows, by the aid of which they can lounge over the new number of some favourite periodical, with which a large table is liberally supplied, or plunge more deeply into some book selected from the library. 
    <P>Descending the staircase to the <num value="1">first</num> floor, we reach the corridor which passes over the central hall, by the head of the grand staircase.   Here our attention was drawn to a large painting of the parable of the <QUOTE>Good   Samaritan,</QUOTE> which was painted some years ago by <num value="1">one</num> of the unfortunate inmates of the hospital-Dadd, a student of the Royal Academy. The wall at the head of the staircase is covered with the names of benefactors to the institution inscribed in letters of gold; and close by is the board-room. This is a fine apartment, adorned with the arms and bequests of every donor to the hospital, together with an excellent portrait of its founder, King Henry VIII., by Holbein, said to be an original. In the <QUOTE>visitors' book,</QUOTE> which lies upon <num value="1">one</num> of the tables in the room, are inscribed the signatures of many royal and noble personages, such as the Emperor of Brazil, the Empress of Austria, the King of Spain, &amp;c.; but apparently more valued than all these put together is an autograph signature of Queen Victoria, written when she visited the hospital in <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>: this is preserved under a glass, upon a table by   itself in <num value="1">one</num> of the recesses between the windows. 
   <P>Turning to the right after leaving the boardroom, we pass at once to the men's wards.   In plan and general atrangement these rooms are the same as on the women's side of the hospital; but, although the male patients are provided with musical instruments, books, and writing materials, <pb id="P.357" n="357"> there is an absence of that neatness and taste in the decoration of the wards and galleries which is such a striking feature in that portion of the hospital set apart for females. 
   <P>A ward on the ground floor, on the men's side, contains a small plunging bath, which is constantly in use in the summer months.   It was formerly the custom to plunge patients unawares into this bath, by letting them fall into it suddenly through a trap-door, in the hope that the shock to their nervous system might help to work a cure.   But such forcible remedies as these have long since been given up, along with strait-waistcoats and other restraints.      Mild and gentle treatment, coupled with firmness, is now   found to be the best of remedies.   The history of the treatment of the patients in Bethlehem, even to a date so late as the beginning of the present century, would be a terrible and sickening recital. In early days the only system adopted in providing for lunatics was <num value="1">one</num> of constant repression and severity, while the common comforts and   necessities of life were almost entirely denied to the poor creatures, who, hopeless, chained, and neglected, wore out their fevered lives in the filthy pesthouse, which, in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, was reported to be <QUOTE>loathsome.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, when <num value="2">two</num> wings appropriated to incurables had been added to the main building in Moorfields, the public were admitted to the hospital as <num value="1">one</num> of the regular London sights; and it may readily be imagined that the promiscuous crowd, who were admitted at a penny each, produced a degree of excitement and confusion which caused incalculable mischief.   This state of things lasted, with only partial improvements, till <datestruct value="1815"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, when the present edifice (or at least the main building) was completed. 
    <P>Now, instead of chains and loathsome cells, we find light and handsomely-furnished apartments, as shown above, in which the exquisite cleanliness of everything is mingled with an air of taste and refinement, which goes far to diminish the horrors even of lunacy.   <num value="1">One</num> room   upon the uppermost floor on the men's side of the building is fitted up as a library, magazines and periodicals lying upon the table, for the use of the patients in their saner moments.   This apartment is in every respect as quiet, as comfortable, as orderly, and as much adapted to the comfort of the readers as that of most clubs, and more than that of many private houses. 
    <P>Amongst the men there seems but little conversation, and not much fellowship.   Smoking is indulged in by such as care for it, and the general aspect of the patients is that of contentment; excepting, of course, those labouring under particular delusions.   Kindness, as we have stated, is the only charm by which the attendants exert a mastery over the patients, and the influence thus possessed is most remarkable.   Whilst the impression left on the mind of the visitor is that of a mournful gratification, it is yet blended with a feeling of intense satisfaction, arising from a knowledge that the comforts of his afflicted fellow-creatures are so industriously sought after and so assiduously promoted. 
   <P>The system of employment carried out seems to be that of providing means for such occupation as can consistently be given to the patients according to their several tastes. The decoration, painting, graining, and so on, for the institution, was mostly executed, a few years ago, by <num value="2">two</num> patients, who, having plenty of time before them, and not being hurried (for no work is <hi rend=italics>exacted</hi>, and no profit by sale is ever made of work done in the hospital), the graining, bird's-eye mapling, and general ornamentation in wood-work, is a sight to see. 
   <P>In the rear of the building is the <QUOTE>play-ground,</QUOTE> a large open space, set apart for the recreation and exercise of the patients, where they may be seen pursuing, with considerable eagerness, the different pastimes in which their fancy leads them to indulge. There are <num value="4">four</num> of these open spaces appropriated to recreation-<num value="2">two</num> for the men, and <num value="2">two</num> for the women-and there is evidence constantly afforded that this exercise not only conduces to the immediate health of the inmates, but also to their ultimate recovery.   Mowing and gardening, and gathering vegetables during fine weather, and haymaking in the summer, are a source of employment and of enjoyment to the men. 
    <P>We have spoken above of the balls and dancingparties that are held in the women's ward. These are occasionally varied by other entertainments for the amusement of the unfortunate inmates.   The beneficial effect of these entertainments on the minds of the patients has at times shown itself.  The case of a tailor, who was, a few years ago, an inmate here, may be taken as an instance in point.  It was mentioned in <num value="1">one</num> of the general reports at the time.   It seems he had been for nearly <num value="4">four</num> years in a state of morbid insanity, with eyes fixed moodily on the ground, neither noticing nor speaking to any <num value="1">one</num>, except an occasional mutter of dissatisfaction if his wishes were disregarded.  On the occasion of <num value="1">one</num> of the monthly parties above referred to, an officer of the institution had undertaken to exhibit some feats of legerdemain, and for that purpose had disguised himself in a black wig and a pair of moustaches.   It was at <pb id="P.358" n="358"> <num value="1">first</num> doubted whether it would be worth while to introduce the gloomy patient amongst the company; but Dr. Hood, at that time the principal medical officer of the institution, had directed him to be brought to sit next to himself, and he was induced to favour them with his company. What strange lucidity passed upon the man's perceptions can never be explained, perhaps; but, almost before he sat down, he had looked half-heedlessly round the room, and, recognising the conjuror through his disguise, said, <QUOTE>A good make--up for--!</QUOTE> His attention had been arrested at last; he followed the tricks, discovered the way in which many of them were performed, and finally drank the Queen's health in a glass of something from the <QUOTE>inexhaustible   bottle.</QUOTE> It is scarcely necessary to remark that from that time there was no relapse into his former state, and that he gradually and steadily improved. 
   <P>A   proof of the general health and longevity enjoyed by the inmates may be found in the fact that Margaret Nicholson, who tried to assassinate George III. at the gate of St. James's Palace, died here in <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, at the age of <num value="98">ninety-eight</num>, after an imprisonment of <num value="42">forty-two</num> years. James Hatfield, who was confined for a similar offence in <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>, died here in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>.   The following account of Hatfield's   crime   was written   by   Sir Herbert Croft :-- 
    <P> <QUOTE>On the <datestruct VALUE="1800-05-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>, during a field day of the Grenadier battalion of Foot-guards in Hyde Park, while the king was present, a ball from <num value="1">one</num> of the soldiers shot a spectator of the name of Ongley in the thigh, at no great distance from his Majesty.   The king showed every attention to the wounded gentleman, but ascribed it wholly to some accident.   In the evening the royal family repaired to the play, which had been ordered by them   at Drury Lane Theatre, as if nothing had happened.   When his Majesty entered the house, followed by the queen and princesses, while he was bowing to the audience, a large horse-pistol was fired at him by Hatfield from the pit.   But the king betrayed no alarm, . . . nor discovered any suspicion of his soldiers: though, in dragging the assassin over the orchestra, a military waistcoat became visible under his great coat. His Majesty only stepped to the back of the box, and prevented the queen from entering, saying, <Q> It was merely a squib, with which they were foolishly diverting themselves; perhaps there might be   another.</Q>  He then, according to the account of a gentleman who was present, returned to the box, advanced to the front, and with folded arms and a look of great dignity, said,  <Q> Now fire!</Q>  Silent but intense admiration burst into acclamations which shook the theatre. Hatfield had served his time as a working silversmith, but afterwards enlisted in the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> Light Dragoons.   He served under the Duke of York, and had a deep cut over his eye, and another long scar on his cheek.   At Lincelles he was left <num value="3">three</num> hours among the dead in a ditch, and was taken prisoner by the French; he had his arm broken by a shot, and received <num value="8">eight</num> sabre wounds in his head. On being asked what had induced him to attempt the life of the king, he said,  <Q>I did not attempt to kill the king--I fired the pistol over the royal box; I am as good a shot as any man in England; but I am weary of life and wish for death, though not to die by   my own hands.   I was desirous of raising an alarm, and hoped the spectators would fall upon me; but they did not.   Still, I trust my life is forfeited!</Q>    Hatfield was subsequently indicted for high treason, but the jury, being satisfied that he was of unsound mind, committed him to Bethlehem Hospital, where he died.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Among the criminal lunatics of more recent years was Oxford, who shot at the Queen soon after her marriage (<datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>). He was released many years ago, and sent abroad under proper surveillance, whence he corresponded, from time to time, with his old friends in the asylum. 
    <P>The criminal ward possessed its aviary, plants, and flowers, and to all appearance was as cheerful as the other portions of the hospital; but the criminal lunatics were removed to Broadmoor, near Aldershot, during the years <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg=1863>1863</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1864--"><year reg=1864>1864</year></datestruct>, and their ward has since been converted to other purposes. 
    <P><num value="1">One</num> of the most recent changes in connection with Bethlehem   has been the erection of a fine convalescent hospital at Witley, near Godalming.  This was established by Act of Parliament, and was brought into working order about the year  <datestruct value="1870"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>. To it are sent such of the patients as are the most hopeful of recovery, to receive the finishing touch, preparatory to their restoration to freedom.  The statute states that it is of great advantage to the persons received here, <QUOTE>that the governors should be able to send away from the hospital, for the benefit of their health, but without relinquishing the care and charge of them as lunatics, such of the same persons as are convalescent, and such others of them as the governors may think fit to send away.</QUOTE> The convalescent establishment at  Witley has been established <QUOTE>for the reception of convalescent and other patients.</QUOTE> Regulations have been made for the new   establishment, and the Commissioners of Lunacy visit the place as if it were duly registered as an hospital. 
    <P>The average number of patients in the hospital <pb id="P.359" n="359"> is about <num value="300">300</num>, of whom   about <num value="2">two</num>-thirds are females. The total number of curable patients admitted during <num value="100">one hundred</num> years, ending the <datestruct VALUE="1876-12-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct>, was <num value="19844">19,844</num>; and out of these the number discharged cured was <num value="9081">9,081</num>, or <num value="45">45</num>.<num value="76">76</num> per cent.   The deaths during the same period amounted to <num value="1334">1,334</num>, or <num value="6">6</num>.<num value="74">74</num> per cent. 
   <P>Bethlehem   Hospital is intended for curable cases only; but unless the patient is of the wellto-do or pauper class, and unless the symptoms of mental disease have existed more than <num value="12">twelve</num> months, it is very rarely that a case is rejected. The number of patients received during the year <datestruct value="1876"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct> was <num value="253">253</num>; and <num value="243">243</num> were discharged within the same period.   Of these <num value="112">112</num> patients were sent out <QUOTE>not recovered;</QUOTE> but of this number <num value="23">twenty-three</num> did not remain in the hospital the full period of <num value="12">twelve</num> months. In every doubtful case the practice of the committee is to give the patient the benefit of the doubt, and allow him or her to remain under treatment at least <num value="3">three</num> months.   A glance at the Annual Report for <datestruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct> shows that the inmates admitted during the year were members of almost every denomination, the Established Church furnishing by far the largest proportion, and the Unitarians the fewest; and that during the same period the male patients comprised among them   no less than <num value="32">thirty-two</num> clerks, the highest number of any other profession or occupation being <num value="9">nine</num>; whilst on the female side <num value="30">thirty</num> were governesses, and <num value="35">thirty-five</num> the wives, widows, or daughters of clerks or tradesmen. Of the apparent or assigned causes of lunacy, mental anxiety is set down as that of <num value="22">twenty-two</num> patients, and mental work as that of <num value="24">twenty-four</num>; religious excitement was the cause of bringing <num value="9">nine</num> inmates to <QUOTE>Bedlam</QUOTE> --of these <num value="5">five</num> were males, and <num value="4">four</num> females; <num value="17">seventeen</num> were brought here through pecuniary embarrassment ; and <QUOTE>love affairs</QUOTE> are set down as the cause of upsetting the mental equilibrium of <num value="5">five</num> persons, <num value="1">one</num> male and <num value="4">four</num> females. 
   <P>A sad love-story, ending in madness in Bedlam, is on record, and may not be out of place here:-- <QUOTE>About the year <datestruct value="1780"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, a young East Indian, whose name was Dupree, left his fatherland to visit a distant relation, a merchant, on Fish Street Hill. During the young man's stay, he was waited on by the servant of the house, a country girl, Rebecca Griffiths, chiefly remarkable for the plainness of her person, and the quiet meekness of her manners. The circuit of pleasure run, and yearning again for home, the visitor at length prepared for his departure; the chaise came to the door, and shaking of hands, with tenderer salutations, I adieus, and farewells, followed in the usual abundance.   Rebecca, in whom an extraordinary depression had for some days previously been perceived, was in attendance, to help to pack the luggage. The leave-taking of friends and relations at length completed, with, a guinea squeezed into his humble attendant's hand, and a brief  <Q>God bless you, Rebecca!</Q>  the young man sprang into the chaise, the driver smacked his whip, and the vehicle was rolling rapidly out of sight, when a piercing shriek from Rebecca, who had stood to all appearance vacantly gazing on what had passed, alarmed the family, then retiring into the house. They hastily turned round: to their infinite surprise, Rebecca was seen wildly following the chaise.   She was rushing with the velocity of lightning along the middle of the road, her hair streaming in the wind, and her whole appearance that of a desperate maniac! Proper persons were immediately dispatched after her, but she was not secured till she had gained the Borough; when she was taken in a state of incurable madness to Bethlehem Hospital, where she died some years after. The guinea he had given her-her richest treasureher only wealth-she never suffered, during life, to quit her hand; she grasped it still more firmly in her dying moments, and at her request, in the last gleam   of returning   reason--the   lightning before death--it was buried with her. There was a tradition in Bedlam that, through the heartless cupidity   of the   keeper, it was sacrilegiously wrenched from her, and that her ghost might be seen every night gliding through the dreary cells of that melancholy building, in search of her lover's gift, and mournfully asking the glaring maniacs for her lost guinea.   It was Mr. Dupree's only consolation, after her death, that the excessive homeliness of her person, and her retiring air and manners, had never even suffered him to indulge in the most trifling freedom with her. She had loved hopelessly, and paid the forfeiture with sense and life.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Dr. Rhys Williams, the resident physician, in the report to which we have referred above, observes that in an asylum constructed like Bethlehem, on the single room system, there are many difficulties in organising careful supervision during the night without disturbing   the patients, and that the feeling of security may be obtained to the detriment of the inmates. The staff of attendants, as we learn from the Report of the Commissioners in Lunacy, is well selected; they consist of <num value="15">fifteen</num> men, including the head attendant, and <num value="32">thirty-two</num> nurses, <num value="6">six</num> of whom   are chiefs of wards.   The night-watch consists of <num value="1">one</num> man in the male <pb id="P.360" n="360"> division, and <num value="2">two</num> nurses on the other side. The watchers make their rounds of the wards at certain intervals throughout the night; and in order to ascertain that these duties are regularly performed, an instrument has been devised, in the shape of a check or <QUOTE>tell-tale</QUOTE> clock, affixed in the wall of each ward.   The warder, in going his rounds, on arriving at each of these clocks, presses upon them a duplicate paper clock-face, properly lined for the various rounds, and by this means receives upon it the impress of a metal letter at the time indicated. Each of the <num value="6">six</num> wards has a different letter, thus-R. E. F. O. R. M. 
   <P>A few words for the guidance of persons applying for the admission of patients may not be out of place here. All poor lunatics presumed to be curable are eligible for admission into this hospital for maintenance and medical treatment: except those who have sufficient means for their suitable maintenance in a private asylum; those who have been insane more than <num value="12">twelve</num> months, and are considered by the resident physician to be incurable; and also those who are in a state of idiotcy, or are subject to epileptic fits, or whose condition threatens the speedy dissolution of life, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.360" n="2000.14.0132"><HEAD>A Ward In Bethlehem Hospital.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 or require the permanent and exclusive attendance of a nurse.   A   preference is always given to patients of the educated classes, to secure accommodation for whom, no patient is received who is a proper object for admission into a pauper county asylum. A printed form, to be filled up by the friend or guardian of the lunatic, can be obtained from the authorities at the hospital. In this form is a certificate, to be signed by the minister, churchwarden, or overseer of the parish in which the lunatic has resided, setting forth that he (or she) is a proper object for admission into Bethlehem Hospital.   A list of the several articles of clothing required to be brought for the use of the patient is also appended to the form; and it is also particularly set forth that during the abode of the patient in the hospital the friends are not to furnish any other articles of clothing than those mentioned, unless by the written request or permission of the steward or matron.   The friends of the patient are likewise strictly prohibited from giving money to the servants to purchase any articles of clothing for the patients; and they are not allowed to offer or give any fee, gratuity, or present, to any of the servants, under any pretence whatever.   The <pb id="P.361" n="361"> infringement of these regulations will involve not only the dismissal of the servant, but also the discharge of the patient from the hospital. 
   <P>We may also add that patients, when sufficiently convalescent, are allowed to be seen by their friends at certain fixed periods; and that, by an order from <num value="1">one</num> of the governors, visitors can be admitted to the hospital on Tuesdays and the <num value="3">three</num> following days in each week. 
   <P>Readers of Charles Dickens will not have forgotten how he makes his <QUOTE>Uncommercial Traveller</QUOTE> wander by Bethlehem Hospital on his way to Westminster, pondering on the problem whether the sane and the insane are not equal: at all events, at night, when the sane lie a-dreaming. <QUOTE>Are not all of us outside of this hospital who dream more or less in the condition of those inside it every night of our lives?</QUOTE> A very pertinent remark for those who really have entered into the philosophy of dreams and dreamland. 
   <P>In Boswell's <QUOTE>Life of Johnson</QUOTE> we read how that Mrs. Burney wondered that some very beautiful new buildings should be erected in Moorfields, in so shocking a situation as between Bedlam and St. Luke's Hospital, and said she could not live 
<FIGURE id="Fig.361" n="2000.14.0133"><HEAD>King Edward's School.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 there; to which Johnson replies, <QUOTE>Nay, madam, you see nothing there to hurt you. You no more think of madness by having windows that look to Bedlam than you think of death by having windows that look to a churchyard.</QUOTE> <hi rend=italics>Mrs. Burney</hi>. <QUOTE>We may look to a churchyard, sir; for it is right that we should be kept in mind of death.</QUOTE> <hi rend=italics>Johnson:</hi>
 <QUOTE>Nay, madam; if you go to that, it is right that we should be kept in mind of madness, which is occasioned by too much indulgence of imagination. I think a very moral use may be made of these new buildings--I would have those who have heated imaginations live there, and take warning.</QUOTE> <hi rend=italics>Mrs. Buriney</hi>. <QUOTE>But, sir, many of the poor people that are mad have become so from disease or from distressing events.   It is, therefore, not their fault, but their misfortune; and, therefore, to think of them is a melancholy consideration.</QUOTE> These remarks, we need scarcely add, are as applicable to the present situation of <QUOTE>Bedlam</QUOTE> as they were to its old site in Moorfields. 
   <p>From   the interior of Bethlehem   the change is pleasant to a building which adjoins it on the eastern side, and is under the same management, namely, King Edward's School, which was <pb id="P.362" n="362"> established here early in the present century. It was formerly known as <QUOTE>King Edward's School, or the House of Occupation,</QUOTE> and was constructed for the accommodation of <num value="150">150</num> girls, and about the same number of boys; but the latter have, within the last few years, been removed to Witley, near Godalming, and lodged in some school buildings contiguous to Bethlehem   Convalescent Hospital. The ground-plan of the building here is in the form of the letter H, the domestic offices, with the chapel above, occupying the central portion.   On the ground-floor of the principal front are <num value="2">two</num> large school-rooms and class-rooms, and also some of the rooms in which the girls are taught domestic duties, such as washing and ironing, &amp;c. The rooms for needlework are in the rear part of the building. The dormitories are large, well-ventilated apartments, and scrupulously clean and tidy in their appearance. The play-ground is divided from the recreation-ground and garden of Bethlehem   by only a wall and a path; and yet, what a contrast between the inmates of the <num value="2">two</num> institutions! The bright faces of the girls are of themselves a comment on the lines of the cavalier, Lovelace- 
             <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=couplet><L>Stone walls do not a prison make,

                  <L>That for a hermitage.</QUOTE>

   <p>The boys' school at Witley was in <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>-<num value="8">8</num> in process of enlargement, by the erection of <num value="2">two</num> new dormitories, planned to accommodate about <num value="50">fifty</num> additional children. Similarly the girls' school has been judiciously re-arranged for the same additional number.   The children are orphans, or such as have lost their fathers' aid through illness or other affliction; they are admitted at the age of <num value="12">twelve</num>, and stay in the school for <num value="4">four</num> years, when situations are obtained for them. The excellent teaching and training which the girls receive here render them highly qualified for situations as domestic servants; and the characters of such as have left the school, received from   time to time by the matron, are almost invariably good. About <num value="70">seventy</num> girls are annually placed out in situations by the institution; whilst the applications for servants which reach the matron are, generally speaking, far more numerous than can be met by the supply. 
    <p>At a short distance from Bethlehem   Hospital, on the site formerly occupied by the Asylum for  Female Orphans, at the junction of Kennington  Road with Westminster Bridge Road, of which we have spoken in the preceding chapter, stands  Christ Church, a new non-denominational church, which has been erected to perpetuate the work inaugurated by Rowland Hill at Surrey Chapel. It was opened on the <datestruct VALUE="1876-07-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct>, the centenary of American independence. The church, a fine specimen of Gothic architecture, is <num value="1">one</num> of the hand. somest ecclesiastical edifices in the metropolis. The cost, including lecture-hall, tower, &amp;c., was <measure value="60000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="60000">60,000</num></measure>.  The organ, a very powerful instrument by Messrs.

Towards the cost of these building upwards of <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure> have been contributed by friends outside the congregation, the greater part of which has been collected by the Rev.

There is ample sitting accommodation for <num value="2500">2,500</num> persons.   The interior, which boasts of several stained-glass windows, and an ornamental oak roof, has an appearance approaching that of a cathedral, to which the service closely corresponds. At <num value="1">one</num> corner of the church is a tower, surmounted by a lofty spire. This structure, called the <QUOTE>Lincoln  Tower,</QUOTE> owes its origin to the suggestion of some  American citizens, at the close of the civil war, that it should be built at the cost of Americans, as a testimony to the sympathy expressed for the  Union by the Rev. Newman Hall and his congregation. The tower, the cost of which was <measure value="7000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="7000">7,000</num></measure>, contributed in England and America, is upwards of  <num value="200">200</num> feet in height.

In the tower are <num value="2">two</num> spacious chambers, designated the <QUOTE>Washington</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>Wilberforce</QUOTE> Rooms; these are used as class-rooms for educational and other benevolent purposes. The architects were Messrs. Paull and Bickerdike. 
   <P>Adjoining Christ Church, and in an architectural sense forming a part of it, is another building, devoted to religious and philanthropic purposes, called <QUOTE>Hawkstone Hall,</QUOTE> after the seat of the head of Rowland Hill's family (Lord Hill), in Shropshire. It is <num value="63">sixty-three</num> feet long by <num value="50">fifty</num> feet wide, with a square gallery, and has sitting accommodation for about <num value="700">700</num>, the woodwork being a stained pitch pine. In the basement beneath the lecture-hall are <num value="5">five</num> class-rooms, <num value="1">one</num> of which will hold <num value="150">150</num> infants, besides another large room, in which meetings are occasionally held. 
    <P>In the last century, as we have seen, St. George's Fields-now the site of numerous palaces of philanthropy--was the scene of low dissipation; and here, on the very focus of the <QUOTE>No Popery</QUOTE> riots of <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, has arisen the Roman Catholic Cathedral dedicated to St. George. This singular evidence of the mutations to which localities are subject, and striking proof of our advance in liberality of <pb id="P.363" n="363"> opinion, occupies a large plot of ground at the junction of the Lambeth, Westminster, and St. George's Roads, and nearly facing Bethlehem Hospital. 
   <P>For many years previously to the erection of the Pro-Cathedral at Kensington, St. George's Cathedral had quite eclipsed St. Mary's, Moorfields, as the chief church of the Roman Catholic body, especially during the years <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>-<num value="52">52</num>, whilst Cardinal Wiseman administered the diocese of Southwark as well as that of Westminster. It was built between the years <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg=1840>1840</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg=1848>1848</year></datestruct>: the Kings of Bavaria and Sardinia, and nearly the whole of the English Roman Catholic aristocracy, were large contributors to its erection; whilst the Irish poor, including the waifs and strays of St. Patrick's Schools in Soho, and other very poor districts, sent their pence. 
   <P> <QUOTE>This cathedral,</QUOTE> writes Mr. R. Chambers, in his <QUOTE>Book of Days,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>by a happy retribution, is bouilt on the very spot where Lord George Gordon's riots were inaugurated by a Protestant mob meeting,</QUOTE> a fact to which we have already drawn the attention of our readers in the previous chapter.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="346">346</num>.</NOTE>
It is said that the high altar stands as nearly as possible on the very spot on which the mad-cap Leader, Lord   George   Gordon, rallied   his <QUOTE>No Popery</QUOTE> rioters in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, previous to marching to Westminster--a curious retribution, if true; but, after all, this may be only a tradition. 
   <P>The cathedral was designed by Mr. Augustus W. Pugin, who, however, always complained that he had been cramped and crippled in the carrying out of his plans, as he was originally called upon to design a parish church, and not a cathedral. Unfortunately, the position of the church is reversed --the high altar, in contrast to that of most Gothic churches, being at the west instead of the east end. It has no galleries, save <num value="1">one</num> small <num value="1">one</num> at the end of the nave for the organ, and will accommodate <num value="3000">3,000</num> worshippers on the floor alone. 
   <P>There was a Roman Catholic <QUOTE>mission</QUOTE> in this neighbourhood as far back as the year   <datestruct value="1788"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>, <num value="8">eight</num> years after Lord George Gordon's riots: mass having been formerly said secretly in a modest and humble room   in Bandyleg Walk, near Guildford Street (now   New   Park Street<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="44">44</num>.</NOTE>).   A   site for a chapel was procured in that year in the London Road, and a chapel was erected in <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>-<num value="93">93</num>, at the cost of about <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>.   It was opened on St. Patrick's Day, <datestruct VALUE="1793-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, the sermon being preached   by <QUOTE>Father</QUOTE> O&lsquo;Leary.   This   chapel served for <num value="50">fifty</num> years as the centre of ministrations for the Roman Catholic clergy in Southwark; but eventually it was found too small, and it was resolved to supersede it by a larger and handsomer edifice. This chapel became subsequently a musichall, and is now called the South London Palace.  The site of the new   cathedral was purchased, in the year <datestruct value="1839"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>, from the Bridge House Estate, for <measure value="3200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3200">3,200</num></measure>. The foundations were commenced in <datestruct VALUE="1840-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, and the foundation-stone was laid on the Feast of St. Augustine, the apostle of  England, in the following May. It was <QUOTE>solemnly dedicated</QUOTE> on the Festival of St. Alban, <num value="1">first</num> martyr of England, <datestruct VALUE="1848-07-4"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=4>4th</day>, <year reg=1848>1848</year></datestruct>, the ceremony being   attended   by bishops from   all the <QUOTE><num value="5">five</num> quarters</QUOTE> of the world; the high mass being sung, and the sermon preached by Dr. Wiseman, who, <num value="2">two</num> years afterwards, was here formally installed as  Archbishop of Westminster, in <datestruct VALUE="1850-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>, a few weeks after receiving his cardinal's hat. Here also the new-made cardinal preached his celebrated series of sermons, explanatory of the step taken by the Pope in restoring the Roman Catholic hierarchy in England. 
    <P>The church, which is built in the Decorated or  Edwardian style of Pointed architecture, consists of a nave, chancel, and side aisles, without transepts; it has also no clerestory--a want which sadly detracts from its elevation and dignity. It measures internally <num value="240">240</num> feet by <num value="70">70</num>.   The material employed in its construction is yellow brick, instead of stone, which by no means adds to its beauty. The total cost of the building, including the residence for the bishop and his clergy adjoining, was a little over  <measure value="35000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="35000">35,000</num></measure>.   A chantry at the end of the north aisle was built by the family of the late Hon. Edward  Petre, M.P., in order that masses might be said there daily for the repose of his soul. This was probably the <num value="1">first</num> chantry so built in modern times.  There is a <num value="2">second</num> chantry, founded by the family of the late Mr. John Knill, of Blackheath.   Attached to the church is a staff of clergy, who attend also the workhouses of Lambeth, St. George's, St.  Saviour's, and Newington, together with Bethlehem and St. Thomas's Hospitals, and Horsemonger Lane  Prison.   Among the former clergy of St. George's was the Honourable and Rev. George Talbot, formerly a clergyman of the Established Church, afterwards chamberlain to Pope Pius IX. The tower still remains   incomplete; but when surmounted with a spire it will be upwards of <num value="300">300</num> feet high. The chancel is deep, and enclosed with an ornamental screen. On either side of the high altar are chapels of the Blessed Sacrament and Our  Lady. The font, which stands in the southern aisle, is of stone, octagonal in shape, and highly decorated with images of angels, the <num value="4">Four</num> Evangelists, and the Doctors of the Church. The organ, which <pb id="P.364" n="364">                                                   . stands in the tower, under a pointed arch <num value="40">forty</num> feet in height, is a powerful instrument. The pulpit, which stands in the nave, attached to the <num value="3">third</num> pillar from the chancel on the northern side, is hexagonal.   It is supported by marble shafts; on <num value="4">four</num> sides of the pulpit are <hi rend=italics>bassi relievi</hi> elaborately carved, representing our Lord delivering the sermon on the mount, St. John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness, and the preaching of the religious Orders of St. Francis and St. Dominic.   These sculptures are executed with all the severity of the early Florentine school, and many of the figures are studies from   nature and real drapery.   The ascent to the pulpit is by a series of detached steps, each supported by a marble shaft, with carved capitals, to which is attached an iron railing. The work is executed in Caen stone, except the shafts, which are of British marble.   The large window in the tower contains figures of St. George the Martyr (to whom the church is dedicated), St. Richard, St. Ethelbert, St. Oswald, St. Edmund, and St. Edward the Confessor, with angels bearing scrolls and musical instruments. The rood-screen, of stone, consists of <num value="3">three</num> open arches, resting on marble shafts, with richly carved foliated capitals; above it stands the cross, bearing the figure of the Redeemer of the world, and on either side stand the Virgin Mary and the beloved disciple.   The cross itself is an original work of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century; the figure of our Lord is from the chisel of the celebrated M. Durlet, of Antwerp; the <num value="2">two</num> other images were carved in England. 
   <P>In spite of the profuse decoration of the chancel and its side chapels, it must be owned that the nave of St. George's has a singularly bare and naked appearance, which is increased by the starved proportions of the pillars that mark it off from the side aisles. At the lower end of the church, near the chief entrance, is a huge crucifix, at the foot of which, at almost every hour of the day, may be seen many devout worshippers. 
   <P>The great window, over the high altar, is of <num value="9">nine</num> lights; it is filled with stained glass, representing the Root of Jesse, or the genealogy of our Lord, the gift of John, Earl of Shrewsbury.   The side windows contain figures of St. George, St. Lawrence, St. Stephen, &amp;c. The high altar and the tabernacle are carved exquisitely in Caen stone; and the reredos, also of stone, contains <num value="12">twelve</num> niches filled with saints and angels. The <num value="2">two</num> side chapels are very elaborately carved and ornamented; and the Petre Chantry is Perpendicular, and not Decorated, in style.   The tomb of Mr. Edward Petre is covered with a slab, the legend on which requests the prayers of the faithful for the soul of the founder, who died in <datestruct VALUE="1848-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct>.   The church is opened from <num value="6">six</num> in the morning till nightfall, and contains a large number of religious confraternities. 
   <P>The bishop's house, where the clergy of this cathedral live in common, is very plain and simple in its outward appearance, and also in its internal arrangements, being arranged on the ordinary plan of a college.   The house of the bishop, it must be owned, is anything but a modern <QUOTE>palace;</QUOTE> it looks and is a mass of conventual buildings; and, to use the words of Charles Knight's <QUOTE>Cyclopsedia of London,</QUOTE> it exhibits more of studied irregularity and quaint homeliness than of pretension as regards design, or even severity of character. <QUOTE>Although these buildings,</QUOTE> the writer adds, <QUOTE>are not altogether deficient in character, yet, were not their real purpose known, they might easily pass for an almshouse or a hospital.</QUOTE> 
   <P>At a short distance eastward, covering, with its gardens, a large triangular plot of ground, stands the School for the Indigent Blind. This institution was originally established in <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, at the <QUOTE>Dog and Duck,</QUOTE> in St. George's Fields, and for some time received only <num value="15">fifteen</num> persons as inmates. <QUOTE>The site being required for the building of Bethlehem Hospital,</QUOTE> writes John Timbs, in his <QUOTE>Curiosities of London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>about <num value="2">two</num> acres of ground were allotted opposite the Obelisk at the end of Blackfriars Road, and there a plain school-house for the blind was built. In <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct> the school was incorporated; and in the <num value="2">two</num> following years <num value="3">three</num> legacies of <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> each, and <num value="1">one</num> of <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>, were bequeathed to the establishment. In <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct> additional ground was purchased and the school-house remodelled, so as to form a portion of a more extensive edifice in the Tudor or domestic Gothic style. designed by Mr. John Newman, F.S.A.   The tower and gateway in the north front are very picturesque. The school will accommodate about <num value="220">220</num> inmates. The pupils are clothed, lodged, and boarded, and receive a religious and industrial education, so that many of them have been returned to their families able to earn from <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>s.</measure> to <measure value="8s." type=currency><num value="8">8</num>s.</measure> per week. Applicants are not received under <num value="12">twelve</num>, nor above <num value="30">thirty</num>, years of age, nor if they have a greater degree of sight than will enable them to distinguish light from darkness. The admission is by votes of the subscribers; and persons between the ages of <num value="12">twelve</num> and eighteen have been found to receive the greatest benefit from the institution.</QUOTE> The women and girls are employed in knitting stockings, needlework, and embroidery; in spinning, and making household and body-linen, netting silk, and in fine basket-making; besides working hoods for babies, work-bags, purses, slippers, &amp;c. <pb id="P.365" n="365"> Many of these are of very tasteful design, in colour as well as in form.   The men and boys make wicker baskets, cradles, and hampers; rope doormats and worsted rugs; brushes of various kinds; and they make all the shoes for the inmates of the school.   Reading is mostly taught by Alston's raised or embossed letters, in which the Old and New Testaments and the Liturgy have been printed. Both males and females are remarkably cheerful in their employment; they have great taste and aptness for music, and they are instructed in it, not as a mere amusement, but with a view to engagements as organists or teachers of psalmody. In fact, here, and here only in London, a blind choir, led by a blind organist, may be heard performing the compositions of Handel, Mozart, and Mendelssohn with great accuracy and effect. Once a year a concert of sacred music is given in the chapel or music-room, to which the public are admitted by tickets, the proceeds from the sale of such tickets being added to the funds of the institution. An organ and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> pianofortes are provided for teaching; fiddles in plenty, too, may be seen in the work-rooms on the men's side. The inmates receive, as pocket-money, part of their earnings; and on leaving the school a sum of money and a set of tools for their respective trades are given to each of them. 
   <P>A touching picture of a visit to the Blind School was given by a writer in the <hi rend=italics>Echo</hi> newspaper, from which we quote the following. The writer, after describing his visit to the basket-making room, proceeds: <QUOTE>I knelt on the floor to watch <num value="1">one</num> little boy's fingers, as he was making what might be a waste-paper basket; my face was almost against his, but he was utterly unconscious of my presence, so that I could see the little hands as they groped about for materials, and the little fingers as they wove so diligently and so nimbly.   Suddenly, whilst I was almost touching him, the boy startled me by saying to himself, aloud,  <Q>That must be a lie about there being a hall in the West which holds <num value="8000">eight thousand</num> people and has <num value="50">fifty</num> stops in the organ.</Q>  <num value="15">Fifteen</num> of the inmates had been taken to an oratorio the night before, and he had heard them talking of it and of the Albert Hall; now he was talking to himself about it as he wove, quite unconscious that my face was against his.   I touched his hand, and the busy weaving stopped, the hands fell on the lap, and the sightless eyes looked round for that light which only can break on them on the morn of the resurrection   . . . The girls' room is singularly light and airy. The light is of no use, but the air is. I was bending down, with my fingers before the eyes of a child of <num value="6">six</num>, whom I could hardly believe to be blind, when I felt a touch upon my head, and, looking back, I saw <num value="3">three</num> blind girls, with their arms entwined, <num value="1">one</num> of whom, feeling in the darkness for the very little girl I was looking at, had touched my hair; they drew back respectfully, and waited until the stranger was gone. Up and down this long girls' workroom, at the hour of recreation, they walk in twos and threes, apparently quite happy, talking incessantly. When I left that room I thought that there was more real light in it than in most of the ballrooms I had ever entered.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The number of pupils in the school is about <num value="150">150</num>, and the articles manufactured entirely by them realise a profit of about .<measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> per annum. The school is maintained at an annual cost of about <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> which is covered by the receipts derived from voluntary contributions and from dividends of nearly <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure>. 
   <P>In the Borough Road, within about <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> minutes' walk of the Blind School, are the headquarters of the British and Foreign School Society. The British, or, as they were originally called, Lancasterian Schools, had great influence during the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="70">seventy</num> years of the present century in raising the state of education in the country among the poorer classes. Without entering into the disputed claims of Dr. Bell and Joseph Lancaster, as to who was the <num value="1">first</num> to originate the peculiar system pursued at these schools, there can be no doubt but that, by the energy of the latter, a practical step of great importance was made towards developing a regular, efficient, and economical plan of teaching. Dr. Bell did much the same kind of work at Madras, but not till Lancaster had already commenced his labours here. Joseph Lancaster was born in Kent Street, Southwark, on the <datestruct VALUE="1778-11-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct>. When only <num value="14">fourteen</num> years old, he read Clarkson's <QUOTE>Essay on the Slave Trade,</QUOTE> and, it is said, was so much moved by its statements that he started from   home, without the knowledge of his parents, on his way to Jamaica, to teach the <QUOTE>poor blacks</QUOTE> to read the Word of God. While still young, he became a member of the Society of Friends, and soon after this his attention was directed to the educational wants of the poor.   The lamentable condition and useless character of the then existing schools for poor children filled his mind with pity and a desire to provide a remedy, and in <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct> he made his <num value="1">first</num> public efforts in education. Before this time, however, he had gathered a number of children together, and his father had provided the schoolroom rent free. When not yet eighteen, he had nearly <num value="90">ninety</num> children under instruction, many of <pb id="P.366" n="366"> whom paid no school fee.   When only in his <num value="21">twenty-first</num> year, he had nearly a <num value="1000">thousand</num> children assembled around him in his new premises in the Borough Road.   Mr. Lancaster had not proceeded far in his attempts before he was confronted by a great difficulty.   Possessed of small means, and surrounded by pupils with no means at all, he must either relinquish his benevolent work, or discover some method of conducting his school without paid teachers and without books. In this dilemma he hit upon the plan of training the elder and more advanced children to teach and govern the young and less advanced scholars; and he denominated this method of conducting a school the <QUOTE>monitorial system.</QUOTE> To overcome the difficulty about books, he caused large sheets to be printed over with the necessary lessons, had them pasted on boards, and hung up on the school walls; round each lesson some <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> children were placed, under the care of a trained monitor. This system quickly attracted considerable notice; and in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct> Mr. Lancaster had an interview with George III., on which occasion his Majesty uttered the memorable words, <QUOTE>It is my wish that every poor child in my kingdom may be taught to read the Bible.</QUOTE> The Duke of Bedford gave Lancaster early and cordial assistance; and the most flattering overtures were made to him in connection with the proposition that he should join the Established Church: all which, as a Dissenter, he respectfully but firmly declined. About this time Lancaster's affairs were so embarrassed, through the rapid extension of his plans of teaching, that in <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct> he placed them in the hands of trustees, and a voluntary society was formed to continue the good work which he had begun.   Hence the society which, in <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, designated itself the <QUOTE>Institution for Promoting the British (or Lancasterian) System for the Education of the Labouring and Manufacturing Classes of Society of every religious persuasion,</QUOTE> but now known simply as the <QUOTE>British and Foreign School Society.</QUOTE> The work was subsequently taken up and put on a sound foundation by Mr. William Allen, of Plough Court, a man of means, and a Quaker, who became treasurer of the institution, and whose portrait now adorns the committee's board-room.   In the meantime, namely, in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, the <QUOTE>National Society</QUOTE> had been started by the Church of England, in opposition to Lancaster's <QUOTE>monitorial system.</QUOTE> 
    <P>From   the great encouragement given to Lancaster by many persons of the highest rank, he was enabled to travel over the kingdom, for the purpose of delivering lectures, giving instructions, and establishing schools, <QUOTE>Flattered by splendid patronage,</QUOTE> says his biographer in the <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's  Magazine</hi>, <QUOTE>and by unrealised promises of support, he was induced to embark in an extensive school establishment at Tooting, to which his own resources proving unequal, he was thrown upon the mercy of cold calculators, who consider unpaid debts as unpardonable crimes.   Concessions were, however, made to his merit, which not considering as sufficient, he abandoned his old establishment, and left England in disgust, and, about the year  <datestruct value="1820"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>, went to America, where his fame procured him friends and his industry rendered him useful.</QUOTE> He died at New York, in <datestruct VALUE="1838-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="69">sixty-ninth</num> year of his age. His memory is now perpetuated in this neighbourhood by Lancaster  Street, a name which has within the last few years been bestowed upon Union Street, a thoroughfare crossing the Borough Road in a slanting direction, connecting the southern end of Blackfriars Road with Newington Causeway, and skirting the east side of the school-buildings. Mr. Lancaster for some years had his school-room   in this street, almost within a stone's throw of the present noble building in the Borough Road; and as lately as the commencement of the present century, the little children who attended the schools were often unable to reach the school-room, because <QUOTE>the waters were out.</QUOTE> There was a large ditch, or rather a small rivulet, which ran northwards down from Newington Butts, and found its way into the Thames near Paris Garden. 
   <P><LEMMA id="lemma.366.1">The institution in the Borough Road</LEMMA> may be looked upon in a threefold aspect. <num value="1">First</num>, it is the Society's seat of government; secondly, here are held the model schools, wherein are taught <num value="350">350</num> boys, and in which the Society desires to have at all times examples at hand for imitation by the branch schools, and into which, accordingly, improved methods of tuition are from time to time introduced. Thirdly, there are here some normal seminaries for the instruction of future masters, who, whilst teaching in the model class-schools, are students themselves in the art of tuition, the most practically important branch of their studies. Of the female training college in connection with the British and Foreign School Society we have spoken in our account of Stockwell.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="329">329</num>.</NOTE>

   <P>These schools, though they profess to stand on a Nonconformist basis, are so liberal and unsectarian in their teaching that they number among their patrons many lay members of the Established Church, and even <num value="2">two</num> of its dignitaries, Dr, Temple, the Bishop of Exeter, and Dr. Stanley, the Dean <pb id="P.367" n="367">

   <P>The <QUOTE>pupil-teacher system</QUOTE> may be said tc have grown out of the monitorial plan of Bell and Lancaster. It was originated about <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>, but has gradually come to be adopted in nearly all the British schools, which really, from an educational point of view, are identical in plan with the National, Wesleyan, and other schools in connection with the Education Department.

<P>This great thoroughfare-which, starting at Blackfriars Bridge, meets at the Obelisk <num value="5">five</num> other roads in St. George's Circus-assumed something like its present shape and appearance in the last half of the last century. It seems at <num value="1">one</num> time to have been called St. George's Road, but was long known as Great Surrey Street.   The road is perfectly straight, and is about <num value="2">two</num>-thirds of a mile in length. Pennant, as we have already remarked, describes the roads crossing St. George's Fields as being <QUOTE>the wonder of foreigners approaching by this road to our capital, through avenues of lamps, of magnificent breadth and goodness.</QUOTE> <num value="1">One</num> foreign ambassador, indeed, thought London was illuminated in honour of his arrival; but, adds Pennant, <QUOTE>this was written before the shameful adulteration of the oil,</QUOTE> which dimmed the <QUOTE>glorious splendour!</QUOTE> Pennant, doubtless, was a knowing man; but he lived before the age of gas, and was easily satisfied. 
   <P><num value="1">One</num> of the earliest buildings of any note which were erected in this road was Christ Church, near the bridge on the west side, occupying part of the site of old Paris Garden; then came Rowland Hill's Chapel, or, as it is now generally called, <QUOTE>Surrey Chapel,</QUOTE> of both of which we shall speak more fully presently.   Next came the Magdalen Hospital, which we have already described; and finally, the Surrey Theatre. The early history of this theatre, if Mr. E. L. Blanchard states correctly the facts in his sketch of it, the <QUOTE>Playgoer's Portfolio,</QUOTE> affords an illustration of the difficulties under which the minor theatres laboured in their struggle against the patented monopoly of Drury Lane and Covent Garden.   The place was <num value="1">first</num> opened under the title of the <QUOTE>Royal Circus and Equestrian Philharmonic Academy,</QUOTE> in the year <datestruct value="1782"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, by the famous composer and song-writer, Charles Dibdin, aided by Charles Hughes, a clever equestrian performer.   It was originally planned for the display of equestrian and dramatic entertainments, on a plan similar to that pursued with so much success at Astley's. The entertainments were at <num value="1">first</num> performed by children, the design being to render the circus a nursery for actors. The play-bills of the <num value="1">first</num> few months' performances end with a notice to the effect that a <QUOTE>Horse-patrol is provided from Bridge to Bridge.</QUOTE> The theatre, however, having been opened without a licence, was closed by order of the Surrey magistrates, but this was not done without a disturbance, and until the Riot Act had been read on the very stage itself. In the following year a licence was obtained, and the theatre being re-opened, a successful harvest appeared now in prospect, when differences arose <pb id="P.369" n="369"> among the proprietors which seriously threatened its ruin. Delphini, a celebrated buffo, was appointed manager in <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>, in succession to Grimaldi, the grandfather of the celebrated clown of Covent Garden and Sadler's Wells Theatres; he produced a splendid spectacle, with a real stag-hunt, &amp;c. Then there were several <QUOTE>dog-pieces,</QUOTE> so called because they were put together in order to introduce upon the stage as actors <num value="2">two</num> knowing dogs, <QUOTE>Gelert</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>Victor,</QUOTE> whose popularity was such that they had an hour every day set apart for them   to receive visitors.   Afterwards a series of <QUOTE>Lectures on Heads</QUOTE> were given here by a Mr. Stevens,<NOTE>See Vol. II., p. <num value="539">539</num>.</NOTE> and many pantomimic and local pieces were performed with indifferent success; among the latter were the <QUOTE>Destruction of the Bastile,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Death of General Wolfe,</QUOTE> &amp;c. The popularity of the theatre was largely increased by the skill of a new stage manager, John Palmer, a gay-hearted comedian, who rather enjoyed than otherwise a life <QUOTE>within the Rules of the King's Bench ;</QUOTE> but this gleam of sunshine came to an end, in <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>, by the arbitrary and (it would seem) illegal committal of Palmer to the Surrey Gaol as a <QUOTE>rogue and a vagabond,</QUOTE> a clause being, at the same time, inserted in the Debtor's Act making all such places of amusement <QUOTE>out of the Rules.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Having been conducted for several years by a  Mr. James Jones and his son-in-law, John Cross, as lessees, with average success, the Circus was destroyed by fire in <datestruct VALUE="1805-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>; it was, however, rebuilt and re-opened at Easter, <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>.   In <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct> the lesseeship was taken in hand by Elliston, who introduced several of Shakespeare's plays, and otherwise endeavoured to raise the character of the house.   His success was such that he now resolved to attempt an enlargement of the privileges of his licence, a step which is thus recorded by Mr. E. L.  Blanchard : <QUOTE>Hitherto the performances authorised did not permit the introduction of a dialogue, except it was accompanied by music throughout.  On the <datestruct VALUE="1810-03-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, Sir Thomas Turton presented to the House of Commons a petition for enabling Mr. Elliston and his colleagues to exhibit   <Q>all such entertainments of music and action as are commonly called   pantomimes and   ballets, together with operatic or musical pieces, accompanied with dialogue.</Q>  The petition, however, was rejected, on the ground that it would  <Q>go far to alter the whole principle upon which theatrical entertainments are at present regulated within the metropolis and <num value="20">twenty</num> miles round.</Q>  The expenses of this fruitless appeal were <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> for the petition, and <measure value="30l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30">30</num></measure> more for a <num value="2">second</num> application to the Privy Council.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The amphitheatre, which had previously been the arena for occasional equestrian exercises, was now converted into a commodious pit for the spectators, and the stables into saloons.   Melo-dramas now became the order of the day; and here Miss Sally Brook made her <num value="1">first</num> appearance in London. All sorts of varieties followed.   <num value="1">One</num> piece was brought out specially to exhibit <num value="2">two</num> magnificent suits of armour of the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century, which afterwards appeared in the Lord Mayor's show. <NOTE>See Vol. I., p. <num value="329">329</num>.</NOTE>

   <P>Tom Dibdin, in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, having offered his services as stage-manager under Elliston, the Circus was extensively altered and re-opened as <QUOTE>The Surrey,</QUOTE> and he held sway here till <datestruct value="1822"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>. After that time the theatre had a somewhat chequered existence, and on the whole may be said to have been <num value="1">one</num> of the chief homes of the English sensational melo-drama. At <num value="1">one</num> time the gig in which Thurtell drove, and the table on which he supped, when he murdered Mr. Weare, were exhibited; and at another, the chief attraction was a man-ape, Mons. Gouffle.   In <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct> Elliston became lessee a <num value="2">second</num> time, and made several good hits, being seconded by such actors as T. P. Cooke, Mrs. Fitzwilliam, &amp;c. 
    <P>It was perhaps during the lesseeship of Elliston that the greatest <QUOTE>hit</QUOTE> was made at <QUOTE>The Surrey.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Elliston,</QUOTE> as a writer in the <title>Monthly Magazine</title> tells us, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>was, in his day, the Napoleon of Drury Lane, but, like the conqueror of Austerlitz, he suffered his declensions, and the Surrey became to him a St. Helena. However, once an eagle always an eagle; and Robert William was no less aquiline in the day of adversity than in his palmy time of patent prosperity.   He was born to carry things with a high hand, and he but fulfilled his destiny. The anecdote we are about to relate is <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> instances of his lordly bearing. When, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, <Q>no effects</Q> was written over the treasury-door of Covent Garden Theatre, it will be remembered that several actors proffered their services <hi rend=italics>gratis,</hi>
in aid of the then humble but now arrogant and persecuting establishment; among these patriots was Mr. T. P. Cooke.   The   Covent Garden managers jumped at the offer of the actor, who was in due time announced as having, in the true play-bill style,  <Q>most generously volunteered his services for <num value="6">six</num> nights!</Q>  Cooke was advertised for  <Q>William,</Q>  Elliston having  <Q>most generously lent [N.B., this was <hi rend=italics>not</hi> put in the bill] the musical score of <title>Black-Eyed Susan</title>, together with the identical captains' coats worn at a <num value="150">hundred and fifty</num> <pb id="P.370" n="370"> courtmartials at the Surrey Theatre.</Q>  Cooke--the score --the coats, were all accepted, and made the most of by the now prosecuting managers of Covent   Garden, who cleared out of the said Cooke, score, and coats <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">one thousand</num> pounds</measure> at half-price on the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="6">six</num> nights of their exhibition. This is a fact; nay, we have lately heard it stated that all the sum was specially banked, to be used in a future war against the minors. Cooke was then engaged for <num value="12">twelve</num> more nights, at <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> per night-a hackney-coach bringing him each night, hot from the Surrey stage, where he had previously made bargemen weep and thrown nursery-maids into convulsions. Well, time drove on, and Cooke drove into the country. Elliston, who was always classical, having a due veneration for that divine  <Q>creature,</Q>    Shakespeare, announced, on the anniversary of the poet's birthday, a representation of the Stratford   Jubilee. The wardrobe was ransacked, the propertyman was on the alert, and, after much preparation, everything was in readiness for the imposing spectacle. No! There was <num value="1">one</num> thing forgottenone important  <Q>property!</Q>   <Q>Bottom</Q>  must be a    <Q>feature</Q>  in the procession; and there was no ass's head! It would not do for the acting manager to apologise for the absence of the head-no, <hi rend=italics>he</hi>
could not have the face to do it. A head must be procured.   Every <num value="1">one</num> was in doubt and trepidation, when hope sounded in the clarion-like voice of   Robert William.  <Q> Ben!</Q>  exclaimed Elliston,  <Q>take pen, ink, and paper, and write as follows.</Q>  Ben   (Mr. Benjamin Fairbrother, the late manager's most trusted secretary) sat  <Q>all ear,</Q>  and Elliston, with finger on nether lip, proceeded-- <Q><emph rend=caps>My Dear   Charles</emph>,--I am about to represent, <Q>with entirely new dresses, scenery, and decorations</Q>, the Stratford Jubilee, in honour of the sweet swan of Avon.   My scene-painter is the finest artist (except your   Grieve) in Europe; my tailor is no less a genius; and I lately raised the salary of my property-man.   This will give you some idea of the capabilities of the Surrey Theatre.   However, in the hurry of 
  <Q>getting up</Q> we have forgotten <num value="1">one</num> propertyeverything is well with us but our <Q>Bottom</Q>, and he wants a head. As it is too late to manufacturenot but that my property-man is the cleverest in the world (except the property-man of Covent Garden) --can <hi rend=italics>you</hi>   lend me an ass's head; and believe me, my dear Charles, yours ever truly, <name rend=caps>Robert William Elliston</name>.   P.S.-I had forgotten to acknowledge the return of the <hi rend=italics>Black-Eyed Susan</hi> score and coats. You were most welcome to them.</Q>  
    <P>The letter was dispatched to Covent Garden Theatre, and in a brief time the bearer returned with the following answer:-- <Q> <emph rend=caps>My Dear Robert</emph>,-- It is with the most acute pain that I am compelled to refuse your trifling request. You are aware, my dear sir, of the unfortunate situation of Covent Garden Theatre; it being at the present moment, with all the <Q>dresses, scenery, and decorations,</Q>
in the Court of Chancery, I cannot exercise that power which my friendship would dictate. I have spoken to Bartley, and he agrees with me (indeed, he always does) that I cannot lend you an ass's head-he is an authority on such a subject-without risking a reprimand from the Lord High Chancellor. Trusting to your generosity and to your liberal construction of my refusal, and hoping that it will in no way interrupt that mutually cordial friendship that has ever subsisted between us, believe me, ever yours, <name rend=caps>Charles Kemble</name>. P.S.-When I next see you advertised for <Q>Rover,</Q> I intend to leave myself out of the bill, and come and see it.</Q>  
    <P>Of course this letter did not remain long unanswered.   Ben was again in requisition, and the following was the result of his labours : 
    <P> <Q><name rend=caps>Dear Charles</name>,--I regret the situation of  Covent Garden Theatre; I also, for your sake, deeply regret that the law does not permit you to send me the <Q>property</Q> in question. I knew that law alone could prevent you; for were it not for the vigilance of equity, such is my opinion of the management of Covent Garden, that I am convinced, if left to the dictates of its own judgment, it would be enabled to spare asses' heads, not to the Surrey alone, but to every theatre in  Christendom.   Yours ever truly, <name rend=caps>Robert William  Elliston</name>.   P.S.-My wardrobe-keeper informs me that there are no less than <num value="7">seven</num> buttons missing from the captains' coats. However, I have ordered their places to be instantaneously filled by others.</Q>  
    <P>We entreat our readers not to receive the above as a squib of invention. We will not pledge ourselves that the letters are <foreign lang=la>verbatim</foreign> from   the originals; but the loan of the Surrey music and coats to Covent Garden, with the refusal of Covent  Garden's ass's head to the Surrey, is  <Q>true as holy writ.</Q> </QUOTE>

   <P>At the time when Elliston was lessee of the Surrey and the Olympic Theatres, about <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, the actors, who were common to both houses, had to hurry from St. George's Fields over Blackfriars Bridge to Wych Street, and occasionally back again also, the same evening.   Sometimes the <QUOTE>legitimate drama</QUOTE> was performed here in a curious fashion.   The law allowed only musical performances at the minor theatres: so a pianoforte tinkled, or a clarionet moaned, a dismal accompaniment to the speeches of <title>Macbeth</title> or <title>Othello</title>.   The fact is that, as Dr. Doran tells us in the epilogue to <title>His Majesty's <pb id="P.371" n="371"> Servants</title>, <QUOTE>the powers of the licenser (the Lord Chamberlain) did not extend to St. George's Fields, where political plays, forbidden on the Middlesex side of the river, were attractive merely because they were forbidden.</QUOTE> Considerable excellence has generally been shown in the scenery at this theatre, which appeals through the eye to the <QUOTE>sensations</QUOTE> of the lower classes; and M. Esquiros, in his <QUOTE>English at Home,</QUOTE> tells us that Danby, as scene-painter, produced at the Surrey some of the chastest effects ever witnessed   on an English stage. 
   <P>After the death of Elliston, the lesseeship was held in succession by Davidge, Osbaldiston, Creswick, and other individuals of dramatic note; but it never rose far above mediocrity. The fabric was burnt down a <num value="2">second</num> time in <datestruct VALUE="1865-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>, but rebuilt and re-opened in the course of the same year, great additions and improvements having been made in its interior arrangements. 
   <P>The change in the name of this theatre, after it ceased to be used for equestrian performances, is thus mentioned in the <QUOTE>Rejected Addresses:</QUOTE> -- 
   <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>And burnt the Royal Circus in a hurry: 
     <L>&lsquo;Twas called the Circus then, but now the Surrey.</QUOTE>
 
   <P>James Smith, in a note in the <title>Rejected Addresses</title>, writes :-- <QUOTE>The authors happened to be at the Royal Circus when  <Q>God save the King</Q>  was called for, accompanied by a cry of  <Q> Stand up!</Q>  and  <Q>Hats off!</Q>  An inebriated naval lieutenant perceiving a gentleman in an adjoining box slow to obey the call, struck his hat off with his stick, exclaiming,  <Q>Take off your hat, sir.</Q>  The other thus assailed proved to be, unluckily for the lieutenant, Lord Camelford, the celebrated bruiser and duellist. A set--to in the lobby was the consequence, where his lordship quickly proved victorious.</QUOTE> 
   <P><LEMMA id="lemma.371.1">The exterior of the old theatre</LEMMA> was plain but neat, and the approaches very convenient.   The auditorium, which was nearly square in form, was exceedingly spacious. The upper part of the proscenium was supported by <num value="2">two</num> gilt, fluted composite columns on each side, with intervening stage-doors and boxes. The pit would seat about <num value="900">900</num> persons. The general ornamentation of the boxes, &amp;c., was white and gold. The gallery, as customary in the minor theatres, was remarkably spacious, and would hold above <num value="1000">1,000</num> persons. It descended to a level with the side boxes in the centre, but from its principal elevation it was continued along both sides over them.   The ceiling sprang from the <num value="4">four</num> extremities of the front and of the side galleries. The centre was painted in imitation of a sky, with genii on the verge and in the angles. A handsome chandelier depended from the centre, besides smaller ones suspended from brackets over the stage-doors, which were continued round the boxes. 
   <P>The present theatre, which, as we have stated above, was built in <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>, is a great improvement upon the old building in every respect. It is considerably larger, and its construction cost <measure value="38000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="38000">38,000</num></measure>; the machinery, with the new appliances insisted on by the Lord Chamberlain for the security of life from fire, cost nearly <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>.   Like most of the minor theatres in London, the Surrey has of late years been occasionally used on Sundays for religious <QUOTE>revival</QUOTE> services, thereby reconciling to some extent the old enmities between the pulpit and the stage. 
   <P>The fact of the Surrey Theatre having been at <num value="1">one</num> time used for the exhibition of feats of horsemanship is kept in remembrance by the sign of a tavern which adjoins it, called <QUOTE>The Equestrian.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The actors of the transpontine theatres of half a century ago very naturally had their habitations almost invariably on the south side of the Thames. Elliston himself lived in Great Surrey Street (now Blackfriars Road); Osbaldiston in Gray's Walk, Lambeth; Davidge, of the Coburg, afterwards manager of the Surrey, lived in Charlotte Terrace, near the New Cut. St. George's Circus, at the south end of Blackfriars Road, was so thickly peopled by <num value="2">second</num>-rate actors belonging to the Surrey and the Coburg, that it was called the Theatrical Barracks. Hercules Buildings, in   the Westminster Bridge Road, had then, and for <num value="20">twenty</num> years afterwards, a theatrical or musical family residing in every house.   Stangate, at the back of <QUOTE>Astley's,</QUOTE> was another favourite resort for the sons and daughters of Thespis; and the <hi rend=italics>cul de sac</hi> of Mount's Place, Lambeth, where Ellar, the famous harlequin, lived and died, was also in great repute as a residence for the pantomimic and equestrian fraternity. 
   <P>A house <QUOTE>somewhere beyond the obelisk,</QUOTE> but not capable of identification now, was the scene of a trifling event in the early life of Charles Dickens, which he records with some minuteness in the autobiographical reminiscences preserved by Mr. J. Forster in his published <QUOTE>Life!</QUOTE> When his father had to pass through the insolvent Court of the Marshalsea, it was necessary to prove that the apparel and personal matters retained were not above <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> in value.   Charles, we suppose, must have been regarded by the law as part and parcel of his father, for he had to appear before an official at this house in his best holiday clothes. <QUOTE>I recollect his coming out to view me with his mouth full and a strong smell of beer upon him, <pb id="P.372" n="372">

But I had in my pocket an old silver watch, given me by my grandmother before the blacking days, and I had entertained my doubts, as I went along, whether that valuable possession might not bring me above the <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pounds'</measure> standard. So I was greatly relieved, and made him   a low bow of acknowledgment as I went out.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Between the Surrey Theatre and the Peabody Buildings, which, as we have already stated, stand on the site formerly occupied by the Magdalen Hospital, is the Temperance Hall, a neat brickbuilt Gothic structure, <num value="1">one</num> of several others erected by the London Temperance Halls' Company. It was built in <datestruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct>, and is used for concerts, lectures, temperance meetings, and so forth. 
    <P>Further northwards, between Webber Street and  Great Charlotte Street, is a house, No. <num value="91">91</num>, used as the Working Men's College. It was opened in <datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>, for the purpose of giving to the working men of South London, and their families, the

 means of a thorough education. Professor Huxley has long acted as principal of the college. Among the work carried on here are technical classes for carpenters and bricklayers, elementary classes in chemistry and in mathematics, and a Civil Service class. 
   <P>A few doors further northward are the offices of the South London Tramway Company, which was founded in <datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>, in order to supply cheap and rapid communication by street cars, on the American principle.   The company have laid down no less than <num value="20.50">20 1/2</num>   miles of street-rails along the high roads connecting Vauxhall, Westminster, Blackfriars, and London Bridges with Greenwich, Deptford, Camberwell, Brixton, Kennington, and Clapham. The cars constantly in use are go in number, employing about <num value="1000">1,000</num> horses and <num value="350">350</num> men. They carry in the course of a year about <num value="15000000">15,000,000</num> passengers. 
   <P>Nearly opposite the above-mentioned offices is the modern Mission College of St. Alphege, named after the saint with whose murder by the Danes the reader has been already made acquainted in our account of Greenwich.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p.</NOTE>
 <pb id="P.374" n="374"> 
    <P>Nelson Square, close by, on the east side of  Blackfriars Road, was doubtless built at the commencement of the century, when the great naval hero was in the height of his glory, and named in honour of him. Beyond a tavern, bearing the sign of the <QUOTE>Lord Nelson,</QUOTE> the square is merely occupied by small tradesmen and as lodginghouses, and therefore is <num value="1">one</num> of those fortunate places which has little or no history attached to it. 
    <P>The <QUOTE>Dog's Head in the Pot</QUOTE> is mentioned as an old London sign in a curious tract, printed by Wynkyn de Worde, called <QUOTE>Cocke Lorelle's Bote.</QUOTE> A sign of this description is still to be seen in the Blackfriars Road, over the door of a furnishing ironmonger's shop, at the corner of Little Charlotte Street, close by Nelson Square. 
    <P>Surrey Chapel, which stands on the eastern side of the road, at the opposite corner of Little Charlotte Street, about <num value="500">500</num> yards from   Blackfriars Bridge, is an ugly octagonal building, with no pretensions to any definite style of architecture. It is still often called <QUOTE>Rowland Hill's Chapel,</QUOTE> after its former minister, the Rev. Rowland Hill, who, though the son of a Shropshire baronet and a deacon   of the Established Church, became a Dissenter from   conviction, and was for half a century the able and eloquent minister of a congregation of Calvinistic Methodists who worshipped here.   He was eloquent, witty, and warm-hearted, and was for many years a power in the religious world, being on the best of terms with the more <QUOTE>Evangelical</QUOTE> portion of the national clergy. His wit was almost as ready as that of Douglas Jerrold or Theodore Hook. Once when preaching near the docks at Wapping, he said, <QUOTE>I am come to preach to great, to notorious, yes, to Wapping sinners!</QUOTE> Another day, observing a number of persons coming into his chapel, not so much to hear his sermon as to escape the rain, he declared that though he had known of persons making religion a <hi rend=italics>cloak</hi>, he had never heard of it being made an <hi rend=italics>umbrella</hi> before! His congregation were much attached to him personally, and always subscribed liberally in answer to his appeals to their purses; and he, therefore, compared them   to a good cow, which gives the more the more that she is milked! His wife was too fond of dress for a minister's wife; and it is said that within these walls he would often preach at her by name, saying, <QUOTE>Here comes my wife, with a whole wardrobe on her head and back;</QUOTE> but this story is apocryphal. At all events, he always denied its truth, declaring that though he was always outspoken in denouncing vanity and frivolity, he was not a bear, but a Christian and a gentleman! 
    <P>In his youth Rowland was noted for that redundant flow of spirits which never failed him even to his latest years.   He was, likewise, even in his younger days, celebrated for wit and humour, an instance of which occurred at Eton, on the occasion of a discussion among the scholars as to the power of the letter H. Some contended that it had the full power of a letter, while others thought it a mere aspirate, and that it might be omitted altogether without any disadvantage to our language.  Rowland earnestly contended for its continuance, adding, <QUOTE>To me the letter H is a most invaluable <num value="1">one</num>, for if it be taken away, I shall be <hi rend=italics>ill</hi> all the days of my life.</QUOTE> With the intention of qualifying himself for <num value="1">one</num> of the livings in the gift of his family, he entered St. John's College, Cambridge, where, from his serious behaviour and somewhat unusual zeal in visiting the sick and engaging in out-door preaching, he became the subject of much obloquy.   When the time came for taking orders, he found that his former <QUOTE>irregular</QUOTE> conduct proved an insuperable   difficulty.   His brother  Richard was the only member of his family who approved of his eccentric conduct at this period.  For several years after leaving college he had been extensively occupied in out-door preaching, both in the country and in the metropolis. The Church of England pulpits were, of course, not then open to him; but among the Dissenters no such obstacle existed.   It was at <num value="1">one</num> time generally believed that he would be the successor of Whitefield at  Tottenham   Court Road   Chapel.   During <num value="4">four</num> years he experienced <num value="6">six</num> refusals from   several prelates; but in <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct> the Bishop of Bath and  Wells consented to admit him to deacon's orders.  His <num value="1">first</num> curacy was Kingston, near Taunton. The  Bishop of Carlisle had promised to ordain him a priest, but was commanded by the Archbishop of  York not to admit him to a higher grade in the  Church, on account of his irregularity. This refusal caused Rowland to remark that he <QUOTE>ran off with only <num value="1">one</num> ecclesiastical boot on.</QUOTE> After leaving his curacy, he returned to his former course of fieldpreaching, and during the next <num value="10">ten</num> years he visited various parts of England, Wales, and Ireland,  London not excepted. <QUOTE>As we are commanded,</QUOTE> he once remarked, <QUOTE>to preach the Gospel to every creature, even to the ends of the world, I always conceived that in   preaching   through England,  Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, <hi rend=italics>I stuck close to my parish</hi>.</QUOTE> In later life nothing gave him greater pleasure than the occasional offer of a Church of England pulpit, for to the close of his life, although fraternising extensively with the Dissenters, he considered himself a clergyman of the Established <pb id="P.375" n="375"> Church.      The time at length came when his somewhat erratic career was to end in a more settled ministry in the metropolis, and where his former popularity would be still further extended. 
   <P>Being in London during the riots of <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, Rowland Hill took advantage of the opportunity afforded him of addressing the large multitudes then assembled in St. George's Fields, sometimes preaching to as many as <num value="20000">20,000</num> persons.   Up to this period of his life, he had exercised his ministry irregularly, preaching in Church of England pulpits when practicable, but more frequently in Dissenting chapels or in the open air. He had, it is said, for some time felt the desirability of a settled ministry, and his wish was soon afterwards carried into effect by some liberal-minded persons coming forward with subscriptions towards the erection of a large chapel in the south of London. The spot selected was in the new road then recently opened from Blackfriars Bridge to the Obelisk.   Among the contributors to the proposed chapel were Lord George Gordon, who gave a donation of <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure>, Lady Huntingdon, and others.   The <num value="1">first</num> stone was laid early in <datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, and the building, which cost about <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure>, was opened in <datestruct VALUE="1783-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>.   From that time till his death, in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, Mr. Hill was the minister of the chapel, residing in the adjoining parsonage-house for the long period of <num value="50">fifty</num> years. 
   <P>When <num value="1">first</num> erected, the chapel stood almost among fields, but in the course of a few years the locality on every side became thickly populated. With regard to the shape of the chapel, Mr. Hill is stated to have once remarked that he liked a round building, for it prevented the devil hiding in any of the corners.   Its close proximity to the public road, and the excellence of the singing, for which it was long celebrated, induced many passersby to enter the chapel.   Many wealthy persons were regular attendants; and among the occasional visitors were Dean Milner, William Wilberforce, Ambrose Serle, and the Duke of Kent.   Sheridan once said, <QUOTE>I go to hear Rowland Hill, because his ideas come red-hot from   the heart.</QUOTE> Dean Milner once told him, <QUOTE>Mr. Hill, Mr. Hill! I felt to-day-&lsquo;tis this slap-dash preaching, say what they will, that does all the good;</QUOTE> and the Duke of Kent, in Mr. Hill's parlour, mentioned how much he was struck by the service, especially the singing. 
    <P>Sir Richard Hill, the brother of Rowland, was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> trustees, and a frequent attendant. Although in every particular it was essentially a Dissenting chapel, the liturgical service of the Church of England was regularly used, while the most celebrated preachers of all denominations have occupied the pulpit. For the <num value="1">first</num> few years after the erection of the chapel, Mr. Hill availed himself of the occasional services of clergymen of the Establishment, among whom were the Revs. John Venn and Thomas Scott, and also some eminent Dissenting ministers. But, in <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, the publication of a satirical pamphlet directed against the Established clergy, entitled <QUOTE>Spiritual Characteristics,</QUOTE> having special reference to an Act then recently passed in Parliament, with the object of enforcing the residence of some of the beneficed clergy, and generally believed to have been written by Mr. Hill, resulted in the withdrawal of the services of his clerical friends.   It was his usual custom to spend the summer of each year in itinerant preaching in various parts of England and Wales, and during these absences from London his pulpit was regularly supplied by eminent Dissenting ministers.   He found   time to visit Scotland   more than once.   The popularity of several of his substitutes was so great that the spacious chapel, which had sittings for about <num value="2000">2,000</num> persons, was sometimes more crowded than when Rowland Hill was the officiating minister.   Very large sums have been annually raised for the various charitable institutions and religious societies connected with Surrey Chapel. The organ, which in its day was considered a powerful instrument, was for many years played by Mr. Jacobs, whose musical ear was so fine that he'was selected by <LEMMA id="lemma.375.1">Haydn</LEMMA> to tune his pianoforte.   The singing at Surrey Chapel was long a special feature; and Mr. Hill is said to have once remarked that he <QUOTE>did not see why the devil should have all the good tunes,</QUOTE> for in his lifetime and some years afterwards it was a common occurrence to hear certain hymns, composed by Rowland Hill, sung to the tunes of <QUOTE>Rule, Britannia,</QUOTE> or the <QUOTE>National Anthem.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The poet Southey, who paid a visit to Surrey Chapel in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, when Rowland Hill was in his <num value="79">seventy-ninth</num> year, gives in <num value="1">one</num> of his letters the following particulars : 
   <P> <QUOTE>Rowland Hill's pulpit is raised very high; and before it, at about half the height, is the reader's desk on his right, and the clerk's on his left--the clerk being a very grand personage, with a sonorous voice. The singing was so general and so good, that I joined in it. During the singing, after Rowland had made his prayer before the sermon, we were beckoned   from   our humble places by a gentleman in <num value="1">one</num> of the pews.   He was very civil; and by finding out the hymns for me, and presenting me with the book, enabled me to sing, which I did to admiration. Rowland, a fine, tall old man, with strong features, very like his portrait, began by reading <num value="3">three</num> verses for his <pb id="P.376" n="376"> text, stooping to the book in a very peculiar manner. Having done this, he stood up erect, and said,  <Q>Why, the text is a sermon, and a very weighty <num value="1">one</num> too.</Q>  I could not always follow his delivery, the loss of his teeth rendering his words sometimes indistinct, and the more so because his pronunciation is peculiar, generally giving <hi rend=italics>e</hi> the sound of 
<hi rend=italics>ai</hi>, like the French. His manner was animated and striking, sometimes impressive and dignified, always remarkable; and so powerful a voice I have rarely or ever heard. Sometimes he took off his spectacles, frequently stooped down to read a text, and on these occasions he seemed to double his body, so high did he stand. He told <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> familiar stories, and used some odd expressions, such as,  <Q>A murrain on those who preach that when we are sanctified we do not grow in grace   </Q>  And again,  <Q>I had almost said I had rather see the devil in the pulpit than an Antinomian!</Q>  The purport of his sermon was good; nothing fanatical, nothing enthusiastic; and the Calvinism it expressed was so qualified as to be harmless. The manner, that of a performer, as great in his line as Kean or Kemble: and the manner it is which has attracted so large a congregation about him, all of the better order of persons in business.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Mr. Hill sometimes caused his chapel to take a prominent part on public occasions, even in politics. For instance, when the peace of Amiens took place in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, he exhibited in front of his chapel an appropriate transparency, with the quaint motto, <QUOTE>May the new-born peace be as old as Methuselah!</QUOTE> When, a few months later, the peace was at an end, and the invasion of this country was threatened by Napoleon, volunteer companies were raised in every district. Mr. Hill at once invited the volunteers in and around the metropolis to come to his chapel to hear a sermon, on the afternoon of the <datestruct VALUE="1803-12-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, on which occasion the building was thronged in every part. Of this service he afterwards remarked, speaking of the volunteers, <QUOTE>I acknowledge that your very respectacle appearance, your becoming deportment while in the house of God, and especially the truly serious and animated manner in which you all stood up to sing the high praises of our God, filled me with solemn surprise, and exhibited before me <num value="1">one</num> of the most affecting scenes I ever beheld.</QUOTE> Mr. Hill composed a hymn specially for the occasion, which was sung to the tune of the <QUOTE>National Anthem;</QUOTE> and another commencing thus- 
           <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>When Jesus <num value="1">first</num>, at Heaven's command, 
             <L>Descended from his azure throne,</QUOTE>
which was sung to the air of <QUOTE>Rule, Britannia.</QUOTE> After the battle of Waterloo, in which <num value="5">five</num> of his nephews were engaged, a neat transparency, which attracted some attention, was placed in front of the chapel.   At the head of it <num value="2">two</num> hands held, on a scroll, the words, <QUOTE>The tyrant is fallen!</QUOTE> Under this came a quotation from Obadiah <num value="3">3</num>, <num value="4">4</num>; to which was added, <QUOTE>Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</QUOTE> The subject of the painting was the sun setting on the sea, exhibiting on the shore, to the left, a lion crouching at the foot of a fortress near the trophies of war; and to the right, a lamb lying by the implements of agriculture, with a village church and a cottage before it. 
   <P>Rowland Hill's labours as a philanthropist are not so generally known as his fame as a preacher. During <num value="1">one</num> of his summer visits to Wotton-under- Edge, Gloucestershire, where he had erected a small chapel, he became   acquainted with Dr. Jenner, who lived in the vicinity of that village. He soon saw the advantages resulting from vaccination, and henceforward very earnestly recommended the practice of inoculation, publishing, in <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, a pamphlet on the subject, in which he defended the new proposal from the aspersions of some of its opponents. <QUOTE>This,</QUOTE> said he, <QUOTE>is the very thing for me;</QUOTE> and wherever he went to preach on his country excursions, he frequently announced after his sermon, <QUOTE>I am   ready to vaccinate to-morrow   morning as many children as you choose; and if you wish them to escape that horrid disease, the small-pox, you will bring them.</QUOTE> <num value="1">One</num> of the most effective vaccine boards in London was established at Surrey Chapel. At different places he instructed suitable persons in the use of the lancet for this purpose. It has been stated that in a few years the numbers inoculated by him amounted to more than <num value="10000">10,000</num>.   It may be further added that the <num value="1">first</num> Sunday School in London was established in Mr. Hill's chapel.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="71">71</num>.</NOTE>

    <P>His untiring exertions on behalf of religious liberty ought not to be forgotten.   In the earlier part of the present century a most determined effort was made to subject Dissenting chapels to parochial assessments, or the payment of poor's rates, and the experiment was <num value="1">first</num> tried with Surrey Chapel, on account of its nondescript character. Mr. Hill resisted the attempt, because he regarded it as an invasion of the Toleration Act, which George III., in his <num value="1">first</num> speech from the throne, had pledged himself to maintain inviolable.   Mr. Hill and his friends were summoned to attend at the Guildford sessions, and although they gained a temporary success, they were compelled to appear on <num value="5">five</num> <pb id="P.377" n="377"> subsequent occasions, on   each   of which   the parochial authorities   were   unsuccessful.   The subject was then taken up by the Dissenters generally, Mr. Hill meanwhile publishing a pamphlet on the subject, which soon passed through <num value="3">three</num> editions. His exertions were at last crowned with success by the passing of the Religious Worship Act, which repealed certain Acts relating to religious worship and assemblies, and henceforward set the question for ever at rest. During these inquiries concerning the taxation of Surrey Chapel, it was elicited in evidence that instead of the revenues of the chapel going to Rowland Hill, as was by some persons believed, it turned out that the chapel was vested in the hands of trustees, and after the payment of all expenses incident to public worship, only a small surplus remained. Some person once said of him, <QUOTE>Rowland Hill must get a good annual sum by his chapels and his travelling;</QUOTE> and on this coming to his ears, he remarked, <QUOTE>Well, let any <num value="1">one</num> pay my travelling expenses for <num value="1">one</num> year, and he shall have all my gains, I promise him.</QUOTE> He did not relax his labours even in old age, for in <num value="1">one</num> week, when past <num value="71">seventy-one</num>, he travelled a <num value="100">hundred</num> miles in a mountainous part of Wales, and preached twentyone sermons. During his long ministry of <num value="66">sixty-six</num> years he preached at least <num value="23000">23,000</num> sermons, many of which were delivered in the open air, being an average of <num value="350">350</num> every year. 
   <P>In the <QUOTE>Picture of London</QUOTE> for <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct> the name of Mr. Rowland Hill is placed at the head of the popular preachers among the <QUOTE>Calvinistic Methodists.</QUOTE> He is described as <QUOTE>remarkable for a very vehement kind of eloquence, and on all subjects having the gift of a ready utterance; he is followed,</QUOTE> adds the writer, <QUOTE>by the most crowded audiences, chiefly composed of the lower classes of society. ....          Many of the most popular preachers among the   Methodists are ordained ministers of the Established Church, and have no objection to administer the ordinances of religion either in the church, the chapel, the meeting-house, or the open air.</QUOTE> As a preacher, he long held a position in the religious world which has never been paralleled, except, perhaps, by Robert Hall. Even Bishop Blomfield declared that Mr. Hill was the best preacher that he had ever heard. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion Bishop Maltby accompanied Dr. Blomfield to the Surrey Chapel. The <num value="2">two</num> bishops were great Greek scholars, and as the preacher floundered in some allusion to the original Greek of his text, the <num value="2">two</num> prelates sat and winked at each other, enjoying the fun. 
   <P>Mr. J. T. Smith, in his <QUOTE>Book for a Rainy Day,</QUOTE> tells an amusing anecdote concerning Rowland Hill, which we may be pardoned for quoting. Mr. Smith narrates how that <num value="1">one</num> Sunday morning, in his younger days, he was passing Surrey Chapel on his way to Camberwell, when the <QUOTE>swelling pipes</QUOTE> of the organ had such an attraction that he was induced to go inside. He then proceeds :-- <QUOTE>No sooner was the sermon over and the blessing bestowed, than   Rowland   electrified his hearers by vociferating,  <Q>Door-keepers, shut the doors!</Q>  Slam went <num value="1">one</num> door; bounce went another; bang went a <num value="3">third</num>; at last, all being anxiously silent as the most importantly unexpected scenes of Sir Walter Scott could make them, the pastor, with a slow and dulcet emphasis, thus addressed his congregation:-- <Q> My dearly beloved, I speak it to my shame, that this sermon was to have been a charity sermon, and if you will only look down into the green pew at those-let me see-<num value="3">three</num> and <num value="3">three</num> are <num value="6">six</num>, and <num value="1">one</num> makes <num value="7">seven</num>, young men with red morocco prayer-books in their hands, poor souls! they were backsliders, for they went on the Serpentine River, and other far distant waters, on a Sabbath; they were, however, as you see, all saved from a watery grave. I need not tell ye that my exertions were to have been for the benefit of that benevolent institution, the Humane Society. What! I see some of ye already up to be gone; fie! fie! fie!-never heed your dinners; don't be Calibans, nor mind your pockets.   I know that some of ye are now attending to the devil's whispers. I say, listen to me! take my advice, give shillings instead of sixpences; and those who intended to give shillings, display half-crowns, in order not only to thwart the foul fiend's mischievousness, but to get your pastor out of this scrape; and if you do, I trust Satan will never put his foot within this circle again. Hark ye! I have hit upon it; ye shall leave us directly. The Bank Directors, you must know, have called in the dollars; now, if any of you happen to be encumbered with a stale dollar or <num value="2">two</num>, jingle the Spanish in our dishes; we'll take them, they'll pass current here. Stay, my friends, a moment more. I am to dine with the Humane Society on Tuesday next, and it would shock me beyond expression to see the strings of the Surrey Chapel bag dangle down its sides like the tags upon Lady Huntingdon's servants' shoulders. Now, mind what I say, upon this occasion I wish for a bumper as strenuously as Master Hugh Peters did when he recommended his congregation in Broadway Chapel to take a <num value="2">second</num> glass.</Q> </QUOTE> Mr. Smith adds, as a foot-note, that it is recorded of Hugh Peters, a celebrated preacher during the usurpation of Oliver Cromwell, <pb id="P.378" n="378"> that when he found the sand of his hour-glass had descended, he turned it, saying, <QUOTE>Come, I know you to be jolly dogs, we'll take t'other glass.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Mr. Sidney, <num value="1">one</num> of Rowland Hill's biographers, relates an amusing instance of his ready wit. It seems he was accustomed, when in the desk, to read any request for prayer that might be sent in. <num value="1">One</num> day he thus commenced- <QUOTE> <Q>The prayers or this congregation are desired for </Q> --well, I suppose I must finish what I have begun- <Q> the Rev. Rowland Hill, that he will not go riding about in his carriage on Sundays.</Q> </QUOTE> Not in the least disconcerted, Mr. Hill looked up, and gravely said, <QUOTE>If the writer of this piece of folly and impertinence is in the congregation, and will go into the vestry after service, and let me put a saddle on his back, I will ride him   home, instead of going in my carriage.</QUOTE> He then went on with the service as if nothing unusual had happened. Being reminded of this circumstance many years afterwards by Mr. Sidney, he said it was quite true. <QUOTE>You know I could not call him a donkey in plain terms.</QUOTE> 
   <P>From the Rev. T. W. Aveling's <QUOTE>Memoirs of the Clayton Family</QUOTE> we quote <num value="2">two</num> anecdotes of 
<!>there's a figure of a man here, but the caption is a facsimilie of his signature, not typed.</!>
 Rowland Hill:--As he was entering Surrey Chapel, <num value="1">one</num> Sunday morning, Mr. Hill passed <num value="2">two</num> lads, <num value="1">one</num> of whom   said to his companion, <QUOTE>Let's go and hear Rowland Hill, and have some fun.</QUOTE> The old gentleman went inside the porch, just before the boys, and gave directions to the verger to put them in a certain pew, in front of the pulpit, and fasten the door.   This was done. After the prayers were finished, Mr. Hill rose and gave out his text -- <QUOTE>The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God</QUOTE> (Ps. ix. <num value="17">17</num>); and looking full into the faces of the <num value="2">two</num> youths, who sat immediately before him, he said, significantly, <QUOTE>And there's fun for you.</QUOTE> The congregation, somewhat familiar with the old man's oddities, felt sure that he had a special reason for this strange remark; and when, each time he repeated the text, this singular commentary immediately followed, all looked to see in what direction his glance was turned, and the <num value="2">two</num> lads soon found themselves <QUOTE>the observed of all observers.</QUOTE> The tremor and alarm with which they heard the words that reminded them   of their design   on   coming that morning to Surrey Chapel were not diminished <pb id="P.379" n="379"> when they saw every eye fixed upon them, whichever way they looked; and conscience, <QUOTE>which doth make cowards of us all,</QUOTE> wrought so powerfully--in conjunction with Mr. Hill's illustrations of his text--that <num value="1">one</num> of them fainted away, and had to be carried out by his companion. The latter remained comparatively unaffected, except with a temporary feeling of shame.   The youth who fainted returned the next Sunday to the chapel; in the course of time he became an Independent minister; and before he died was chairman of the Congregational Union. The other grew up careless and abandoned, and became an outcast from country and friends. 
   <P>Another anecdote has been related of Mr. Hill, which shows the readiness and wit with which London working men can sometimes retort an 
<FIGURE id="Fig.379" n="2000.14.0139"><HEAD>Interior Of The Rotunda, Blackfriars Road, In <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 unwelcome reproof.   <num value="1">One</num> day, going down the New Cut, opposite his chapel, he heard a brewer's drayman, who was lowering some barrels, swearing most fearfully. Rowland Hill rebuked him very solemnly, and said, <QUOTE>Ah, my man! I shall appear <num value="1">one</num> day as a witness against you.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Very likely,</QUOTE> rejoined the offender; <QUOTE>the biggest rogues always turn king's evidence!</QUOTE> This unwelcome retort made Mr. Hill resolve to be cautious in future, when he reproved such men again, <hi rend=italics>how</hi> he reproved them. 
   <P>Rowland Hill's biographers inform us that a generous benevolence was a distinguishing trait of his character, and that he seemed to possess the power of inspiring his flock with a similar spirit. On <num value="2">two</num> occasions on which collections were made in the churches and chapels throughout the <pb id="P.380" n="380"> kingdom (the Patriotic Fund at Lloyd's, and the subscription for the relief of the German sufferers), the collections at Surrey Chapel are recorded to have been the largest raised at any <num value="1">one</num> place. The sum annually raised for charitable and religious institutions at Surrey Chapel has varied from <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure> to <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure>. 
   <P>Rowland Hill's death took place in <datestruct VALUE="1833-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="89">eighty-ninth</num> year of his age.   Up to the last fortnight of his life he was able to preach a sermon of nearly an hour's duration once every Sunday. He was buried, at his own request, beneath the pulpit of Surrey Chapel. The funeral service was attended by a very large congregation; his nephew, the head of his family, Lord Hill, then Commanderin-Chief of the army, being the chief mourner. A tablet and bust in his memory were placed soon afterwards in the gallery behind the pulpit.   His successor in the ministry of Surrey Chapel was the Rev. James Sherman, on whose resignation, in the year <datestruct value="1854"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>, the pulpit became occupied by the Rev. Newman Hall. 
    <P>Rowland Hill, when advanced in life, became possessed of some fortune; and accordingly, at his decease, he left the large sum of <measure value="11000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="11000">11,000</num></measure> to the Village Itinerancy, together with sundry donations to different religious institutions. Besides these bequests, he left a sum of money for the perpetuation of Surrey Chapel at the expiration of the lease; but this gift having subsequently been declared informal, as coming under the Statute of Mortmain, the bequest reverted to Hackney College, and in <datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct> the congregation set themselves zealously to work to subscribe a sum equal to that which they had lost (<measure value="8000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="8000">8,000</num></measure>). As they were unable to obtain a renewal of the lease, a new church was erected in the Westminster Bridge Road, on the site formerly occupied by the Female Orphan Asylum, as we have already stated;<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, pp. <num value="350">350</num>, <num value="362">362</num>.</NOTE>      and to this new building the congregation migrated in <datestruct VALUE="1876-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct>.   Since that date Surrey Chapel has been occupied by the Primitive Methodists. 
    <P>Surrey Chapel became <QUOTE>the centre of a system of benevolent societies designed to   reach   the various classes of the community;</QUOTE> and in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>  Rowland Hill established some almshouses in the adjacent Gravel Lane, in a thoroughfare now known as Hill Street, on a spot ominously enough named Hangman's Acre, where <num value="24">twenty-four</num> poor widows found a home.   Mr. Charlesworth, in his recently published <QUOTE>Life of Rowland Hill,</QUOTE> thus records the eccentric preacher's mode of dealing with   applicants:-- <QUOTE>An   aged female wished to qualify herself for admission to an almshouse by becoming a member of the church.    <Q>So you wish to join the church? </Q> -- <Q> If you please, sir.</Q>   <Q>Where have you been accustomed to hear the Gospel?</Q> --  <Q>At your <hi rend=italics>blessed</hi> chapel, sir.</Q>   <Q> Oh! indeed; at my 
<hi rend=italics>blessed</hi> chapel; dear me! And how long have you attended with us? </Q> -- <Q> For several years.</Q>   <Q> Do you think you have got any good by attending the chapel? </Q>  <Q> Oh! yes, sir.   I have had many <hi rend=italics>blessed</hi>
seasons.</Q>     <Q>Indeed!   Under whose ministry do you think you were led to feel yourself to be a sinner? </Q> -- <Q> Under your blessedministry.</Q>   <Q> Indeed! And do you think your heart is pretty good?</Q> --  <Q>Oh, no! sir; it is a very bad <num value="1">one</num>.</Q>   <Q>What! and do you come here with your bad heart, and wish to join the church?</Q> -- <Q> Oh, sir! I mean that my heart is not worse than others; it is pretty good on the whole!</Q>   <Q> Indeed! that's more than I can say; I'm   sure mine's bad enough. Well, have you heard that we are going to build some <hi rend=italics>blessed</hi>
almshouses? </Q> -- <Q> Yes, sir, I have.</Q>     <Q>Should you like to have <num value="1">one</num> of them?</Q>  Dropping a very low curtsey, she replied,  <Q>Yes, sir, if you please.</Q>   <Q>I thought so.

    <P>On the west side of Blackfriars Road, about midway between Great Charlotte Street and the bridge, is <LEMMA id="lemma.381.1">Christ Church</LEMMA>, which dates its erection from the middle of the last century. The parish of Christ Church was taken out of that of St.  Saviour, Southwark, and was originally part of the district called the Liberty of Paris Garden. This spot, as we have shown in a previous chapter,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="53">53</num>.</NOTE> was <num value="1">one</num> of the ancient places of amusement of the metropolis; and it seems to have been much frequented on Sundays for bear-baiting, a favourite sport in the time of Queen   Elizabeth.   Paris  Garden, according to the ancient maps, extended from the west end of Bankside and the Liberty of the Clink towards what is now the southern extremity of Blackfriars Bridge. On the east it appears bounded by a mill-stream and mill-pond, and a road marked as leading to Copt Hall; there was also a mill, with gates, between the pond and the Thames.   There is, or used to be, a ditch or dyke running across Great Surrey Street; but for some years it has been covered or built upon. All buildings thereon are subject to a ground-rent, payable to <QUOTE>the steward of the manor of Old Paris  Garden, and are collected half-yearly.</QUOTE> <NOTE><hi rend=italics>Notes, and Queries</hi>, <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>.</NOTE>      In the <pb id="P.381" n="381"> centre of the Liberty stood a cross, from which a narrow thoroughfare, marked <QUOTE>Olde Parris Lane,</QUOTE> leads down to the river. On the south-east, a winding thoroughfare, with water on both sides, leads to St. George's Fields; and on the south-west another to the <QUOTE>Manner <hi rend=italics>(sic</hi>) House.</QUOTE> There are small rows of cottages along parts of these roads. 
    <P>In early times very few houses stood on this marshy ground; but we have an account of a mansion or manor-house built upon a somewhat elevated part of the marsh, near the river, by <num value="1">one</num>  Robert of Paris, in the reign of Richard II.; the locality is still indicated by the name of Upper  Ground Street. <QUOTE>It is said,</QUOTE> writes the author of <QUOTE>London in the Olden Time,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>that the king commanded the butchers of London to purchase this estate by the river-side for the purpose of making it a receptacle for garbage discharged from the city slaughter-houses, so that the inhabitants might not be annoyed therewith.  This plot of ground, called Paris Garden--for so it has always been designated-is, or was, surrounded by the Thames and its waters which flow through ditches at high tides.</QUOTE> 
    <P>It appears that subsequently this estate of Robert of Paris came into the possession of the prior and monks of Bermondsey Abbey; but on the dissolution of the monasteries it was sold, and fell into lay hands.   About <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> years afterwards, in the reign of William and Mary, we find Paris Garden an inhabited locality, the property of a gentleman named Marshall, who founded and endowed here a church, which he named Christ Church, having obtained an Act of Parliament converting the ancient manor of Paris Garden into a parish under that name. 
   <P>The <num value="1">first</num> church was erected at the expense of Mr. Marshall, and finished in <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>.   The steeple and spire, which were <num value="125">125</num> feet high, were not completed till <datestruct value="1695"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>. This edifice, in consequence of the badness of the foundations, soon became so dilapidated, that in <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct> Mr. Marshall's trustees applied to Parliament for power to rebuild it, with the sum   of <measure value="2500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2500">2,500</num></measure>, which had accumulated in their hands from the trust, and obtained an Act for that purpose. The present structure was accordingly erected. This is situated in a spacious burialground. The plan of the fabric is nearly square; and at the west end is a square tower, flanked by lobbies.   The walls are of brick, with stone dressings. The tower is built partly within and partly without the wall of the church; it is in <num value="3">three</num> storeys: the lower has an arched doorway, with a circular window over it, and the <num value="2">second</num> and <num value="3">third</num> storeys each have arched windows.   An octagon turret of wood rises above the parapet in <num value="2">two</num> stages, the lower forming the plinth to the other; in <num value="4">four</num> of the faces are dials, and the whole is finished with a cupola and vane.   The general appearance of the body of the church is plain and uninteresting, both externally and internally. The great east window   contains   some   ornamented stained glass and a painting of the descending dove; in the side lights are the arms of the see of Winchester, impaled with those of Izaak Walton's <QUOTE><hi rend=italics>good</hi> Bishop Morley,</QUOTE> who was bishop of that diocese at the time of the consecration of the church. 
     <P>In Church Street, about the year <datestruct value="1730"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, Mr.  Charles Hopton founded a row of almshouses for <num value="26">twenty-six</num> <QUOTE>decayed housekeepers,</QUOTE> each of whom received <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> per annum and a chaldron of coals. 
    <P>At a short distance northward of Christ Church,  Stamford Street branches off westwards from Blackfriars Road, and thus forms a connecting link with that thoroughfare and Waterloo Bridge Road. It is a good broad street, dating from the beginning of this century; and, with York Road westward of it and Southwark Street to the east, serves as a direct communication, almost parallel with the river, from the High Street, Borough, to Westminster Bridge and Lambeth.   On the south side of Stamford Street is a <LEMMA id="lemma.381.2">chapel, built about. the year  <datestruct value="1824"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, for the Unitarians</LEMMA>. The building, from an architectural point of view, forms a striking contrast with the generality of chapels and meetinghouses. A portico, of the Grecian Doric order, occupies the whole front of the edifice, and imparts to it a commanding and temple-like aspect.  The wall within this portico is unbroken by any other aperture than a single door, forming the entrance to the building. The interior corresponds with the exterior in simplicity of taste and in the style of its decoration, which is of that plainness that it might even   satisfy a congregation   of  Quakers. 
   <P>Nearly opposite the above-mentioned chapel, at the corner of Hatfield Street, is the Hospital for Diseases of the Skin, an institution which since its establishment, in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, has done a deal of good in the gratuitous medical treatment of the poor afflicted with cutaneous diseases. This institution was originally established in New Bridge Street, Blackfriars, and from <num value="800">800</num> to <num value="1000">1,000</num> of the suffering poor are every week relieved here. 
   <P>In Duke Street, close by, are the extensive printing works of the Messrs. Clowes and Sons. This is <num value="1">one</num> of the largest establishments of the kind in the kingdom, and from   its presses have issued many of the works of Charles Dickens, <pb id="P.382" n="382"> Charles Knight, and other eminent men of letters, as well as the publications of the <QUOTE>Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for England and Wales,</QUOTE> numerous military works, and statistical reports for various Government offices. The firm, in <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, undertook the contract for supplying the famous Mulready envelope.   The <hi rend=italics>Mirror</hi> stated that they arranged to supply the public with half a million a day; but the design was distasteful to the public, and the envelope was speedily recalled. 
   <P>At the corner of Stamford Street and Blackfriars Road, on the spot now occupied by the Central Bank of London and <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> large houses adjoining it, stood, till <datestruct value="1874"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>, a row of tenements, which for many years previously, owing to the eccentricity of their owner, a Miss Angelina Read, had been allowed to remain unoccupied.   They had long been windowless, and the dingy rooms encumbered with dirt and rubbish   and overrun with rats; indeed, such a forlorn and desolate aspect had they assumed that they became generally known as <QUOTE>the haunted houses.</QUOTE> In the above year, Miss Read having bequeathed them to the Consumption Hospital at Brompton, they were demolished, and some fine buildings have been erected in their place. 
   <P>A few doors northwards of Stamford Street, on the west side of Blackfriars Road, is the building once occupied by the museum   collected by Sir Ashton Lever, and removed hither from Leicester Square,<NOTE> See Vol. III., p. <num value="165">165</num>.</NOTE> when it became the property of a Mr. Parkinson.

   <P>This curious, extensive, and valuable collection here experienced the most mortifying neglect, till, in <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, it was finally dispersed by public auction, in a sale which lasted <num value="40">forty</num> days. The premises were subsequently occupied by the Surrey Institution, which was established in the following year.  Here some gentlemen proposed to form an institution on the Surrey side of the river, on a plan similar to that of the Royal Institution in Albemarle Street. It was intended to have a series of lectures, an extensive library and reading-rooms, a chemical laboratory and philosophical apparatus,  &amp;c. In <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct> this valuable institution was dissolved, the library, &amp;c., being sold by auction.   After that, the building, which was called the Rotunda, was occupied for some years as a wine and concertroom.   In <datestruct VALUE="1833-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, it was opened as the  Globe Theatre.   <num value="2">Two</num> years previously it had been appropriated to all kinds of purposes, including the dissemination of the worst religious and political opinions, and penny exhibitions of wax-work and wild beast shows.   In <datestruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct> the Rotunda was again opened as a concert-room; but the concern never prospered, and its vicissitudes afterwards are not worth noting. It was finally closed as a place of amusement about the year <datestruct value="1855"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>, and the building is now used for business purposes, being known as the Rotunda Auction and Sale Rooms. 
   <P>At the foot of Blackfriars Bridge formerly stood a range of buildings, which at <num value="1">one</num> time constituted part of the <LEMMA id="lemma.382.1">Albion Mills</LEMMA>.   This extensive concern was set on foot by a company of spirited and opulent individuals, with the view of counteracting the impositions but too frequently practised in the grinding of corn.   On the <datestruct VALUE="1791-03-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>, the whole building, with the exception of the corner wing, occupied as the house and offices of the superintendent, was destroyed by fire, together with <num value="4000">four thousand</num> sacks of flour which it contained. When these mills were burnt down, Horace Walpole was not ashamed to own that he had literally never seen or heard of them, though the flakes and the dust of burning grain were carried as far as Westminster, Palace Yard, and even to St. James's. <QUOTE><num value="1">One</num> may live,</QUOTE> writes Walpole, <QUOTE>in a vast capital and know no more of <num value="3">three</num>-parts of it than of Carthage.   When I was in Florence I have surprised some   Florentines   by telling   them   that London is built (like their city, where you often cross the bridges several times in a day) on each side of the river, and yet that I had never been but on <num value="1">one</num> side; for then I had never been in Southwark.</QUOTE> What would Horace Walpole had said of London, had he lived in the reign of Victoria? 
   <P>The front of the mill remained for many years <pb id="P.383" n="383"> unrepaired, but was subsequently formed into a row of handsome private habitations. These, in turn, were demolished a few years ago, to make room for the Blackfriars station and goods depot on the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway. 
   <P>Somewhere near this spot, at no great distance from the southern end of Blackfriars Bridge, stood the most westerly of the play-houses on Bankside --the Swan Theatre.   It was a large house, and flourished only a few years, being suppressed at the commencement of the civil wars, and soon afterwards demolished. 
   <P>Before the building of Blackfriars Bridge, in <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct>, there was a ferry at this spot for the conveyance of traffic across the river. An idea of the value of some of the ferries on the Thames may be formed from   the circumstance that on the construction of this bridge the committee of management agreed to invest the Waterman's Company with <measure value="13650l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="13650">13,650</num></measure> Consolidated <num value="3">Three</num> per Cent. Annuities, to satisfy them for the loss of the Sunday ferry at Blackfriars, which was proved to have produced, upon an average for <num value="14">fourteen</num> years, the sum of <measure value="409000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="409000">409,000</num></measure>.

<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.383.1">Views in Lambeth</LEMMA></NOTE>

<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.383.2">Thames Tidal Flood Entrance to Prince's Square, Lambeth</LEMMA></NOTE>
 
<P>The parish of Lambeth, upon   which we now enter at its north-eastern angle, previously to its sub-division, was no less than <num value="16">sixteen</num> miles in circumference; being   bounded   by   Newington, Camberwell, Streatham, Croydon, by the river Thames, and by the parishes of St. George's and Christ Church, Southwark. It is divided into <num value="4">four</num> liberties, and again sub-divided into the following <num value="8">eight</num> wards or precincts: the Bishop's, the Prince's, Vauxhall, Kennington, Marsh, Wall, Stockwell, and Dean's. The parish, and especially its palace, is connected with English history; for, as we have already observed, Hardicanute is said to have died suddenly here at a wedding feast--a clear proof that even in the Saxon times there was a palace here, or the residence of some Saxon thane. 
   <P>The early history of the parish is thus told by Pennant:-- <QUOTE>In early times it was a manor, possibly a royal <num value="1">one</num>, for the great Hardiknut died here in <datestruct value="1042--"><year reg="1042">1042</year></datestruct>, in the midst of the jollity of a wedding dinner; and here, without any formality, the usurper Harold is said to have snatched the crown, and to have placed it on his own head. It was then part of the estate of Goda, wife successively to Walter, Earl of Mantes, and Eustace, Earl of Boulogne, who presented it to the Church of Rochester, but reserved to herself the patronage of the church. It became, in <datestruct value="1197--"><year reg="1197">1197</year></datestruct>, the property of the see of Canterbury, by an exchange transacted between Glanville, Bishop of Rochester, and the archbishop, Hubert Walter.   Glanville received out of the exchange a small piece of land, on which he built a house, called Rochester Place, for the reception of the Bishops of Rochester whenever they came to London to attend Parliament. In <datestruct value="1357--"><year reg="1357">1357</year></datestruct> the then bishop, John de Sheppey, built Stangate Stairs, for the convenience of himself and his retinue to cross over into Westminster. Fisher and Hilsley were the last bishops who inhabited this palace; after their deaths it fell into the hands of Henry VIII., who exchanged with Aldridge, Bishop of Carlisle, for certain houses in the Strand, and its name was changed to that of Carlisle House.   The small houses built on its site,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>still (<datestruct value="1790"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>) belong to that see.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In the book of Domesday we find the Manor of Lambeth belonging to this Countess Goda.   <num value="1">One</num> of the holders of the see of Rochester, in the reign of Henry II., exchanged it for other lands with Baldwin, Archbishop of Canterbury; and we know that Hubert Walter, <num value="1">one</num> of his successors in the archiepiscopate and Lord High Chancellor in the reign of Richard I., resided here. 
   <P>If the old manor of Lambeth was co-extensive with the subsequent parish, it must have extended along the Thames from Battersea to Southwark, <pb id="P.384" n="384"> and from the river-side to the limits of Norwood, Kennington, and Streatham, and even to those of the parish of Croydon; but this is not quite certain. 
   <P> <QUOTE>Lambeth, anciently Lamb-hythe,</QUOTE> Northouck thus writes, <QUOTE>is a village   situated   along   the Thames between Southwark and Battersea, extending southward from the east end of Waterloo Bridge, and   chiefly inhabited by glass-blowers, potters, fishermen, and watermen.</QUOTE> The name of the place has been spelled variously as Lambeth, Lambyth, Lamedh, Lamhees, &amp;c.; and so far back as the time of the Danish occupation it was a village adjacent to the capital. 
   <P>Pennant, the antiquary, considers that in the time of the Roman occupation, if not at a later date, the Surrey side of the Thames near the metropolis was in all probability a great expanse of water--a <QUOTE>Llyn,</QUOTE> as the Welsh call it; and he thought that possibly the name of London is but a corruption or variation of <QUOTE>Llyn Din</QUOTE> --the city on the lake. <QUOTE>The expanse of water,</QUOTE> he continues, <QUOTE>might have flled the space between the rising grounds at (near) Deptford and those at 
<FIGURE id="Fig.384" n="2000.14.0140"><HEAD>The South Side Of The Thames, Taken From Adelphi Terrace.                      (From An Etching By Nugent, In <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 Clapham, and have been bounded to the south by the beautiful Surrey hills. Lambeth Marsh and the Bank-side evidently were recovered from the water. Along Lambeth are the names of <Q> Narrow Walls,</Q>  or mounds, which served for that purpose; and in Southwark, again,  <Q>Bankside</Q>  shows the means of converting the ancient lake into useful land. Even to this day the tract beyond Southwark, and in particular that beyond Bermondsey Street, is so very low, and beneath the level of common (spring) tides, that the proprietors are obliged to secure it by embankments.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Pennant tells us also that in <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct> there was not a single house standing between Lambeth Palace and Southwark! Indeed, the place was all open country even in the time of Charles II. Thus Pepys writes in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> in <datestruct VALUE="1663-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>Went across the water to Lambeth, and so over the fields to Southwark.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In Ralph Aggas' map of London, to which we have often referred, in the foreground on the left are the Palace of the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lambeth Church, with only <num value="1">one</num> house at a small distance off; a little to the northward is a <pb id="P.385" n="385"> road leading to the river opposite the landing-place in Palace Yard. The principal ditch of Lambeth Marsh, if we may trust the map, falls into the Thames opposite the Temple Gardens, the ground being occupied by only a single dwelling. On the river-bank opposite Whitefriars commences a line of houses, with gardens and groves behind them, and continued, with little intermission, to the stairs and palace of the Bishop of Winchester on the Bankside.   <num value="1">One</num> of the most noted places along this line is Paris Garden, the site of which, as we have stated in the preceding chapter, is now covered by Christ Church in Blackfriars Road. Further eastward, but behind the houses, we see certain circular buildings for bull and bear baiting-amusements to which the <QUOTE>virgin</QUOTE> Queen Elizabeth was partial. Near the bear-baiting place, or <QUOTE>Bear-garden,</QUOTE> as it was styled, was a dog-kennel, from which several savage dogs are seen issuing forth. From   Winchester Palace to the Borough High Street, and along Tooley (St. Olave's) Street to Battle Bridge, the houses stand somewhat thickly; but towards Horselydown the ground is open, and the buildings are surrounded with gardens. We here see London Bridge crowded with buildings, among which the 
<FIGURE id="Fig.385" n="2000.14.0141"><HEAD>Searle's Boat-Yard In <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 famous Nonsuch House is conspicuous.   Another striking object in the foreground is the noble cruciform church of St. Mary Overie, of which we have already spoken, in magnitude and architectural character the <num value="3">third</num> church in the metropolis, with its pinnacled tower a <num value="150">hundred and fifty</num> feet in height.   The park of the Bishop of Winchester appears also walled in on all sides; hence comes the name of Park Street in this locality. On the right stands St. Olave's Church, built before the Norman Conquest. 
    <P>The history of Lambeth for several centuries was mainly confined to the Palace, and consequently little remains to be said here till we come down to the beginning of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. No doubt, every district of this great metropolis has a character, moral if not physical, of its own; but the American writer who remarked that <QUOTE>there is scarcely a greater difference between Americans and Russians than between the inhabitants of Lambeth and of Central London,</QUOTE> was guilty of at least a rhetorical exaggeration, if not of something worse. 
   <P>A curious old etching by Thomas Nugent, of about the date <datestruct value="1770"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, which we reproduce on page <num value="384">384</num>, shows the south side of the Thames, as seen <pb id="P.386" n="386"> from the top of the Adelphi Terrace.   In the foreground is the <QUOTE>Shot Tower,</QUOTE> still standing, near the southern end of Waterloo Bridge; near it, a little to the west, are Cuper's Gardens, a mass of trees and foliage; to the south is the Windmill, in Lambeth Marsh; and lastly, St. George's Fields.   In the distance are houses, high out of all proportion, and of foreign appearance; while the Surrey hills rise to absurd heights in the background, somewhat like the chain of the Apennines. 
   <P>A   poem   on this rural spot, published in the 
<hi rend=italics>Mirror</hi> in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, mentions-we know not whether with a poet's lawful exaggeration or not- <QUOTE>tall oaks</QUOTE> as still <QUOTE>waving their ancient branches overhead;</QUOTE> and in it are recounted many of the historical recollections of the place: how Hardicanute died suddenly here, while feasting his subjects.

And then the writer proceeds to record the persecutions of which the Lollards' Tower was too often the scene; the shelter afforded by the church porch to Mary of Modena, when she fled from Whitehall with her little son, as we have already said; the burial of the <num value="2">two</num> Tradescants, father and son. But we must descend from the lofty region of poetry and imagination to sober prose and dry facts. 
    <P>Lambeth, however, is not quite without its historical romance, for to this place Lord Percy and the Duke of Lancaster, John of Gaunt, were glad to be able to effect their escape from the Savoy when that palace was assailed and sacked by the mob in <datestruct value="1377--"><year reg="1377">1377</year></datestruct>.<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="95">95</num>.</NOTE>

    <P>Here, in <datestruct value="1609--"><year reg="1609">1609</year></datestruct> or <datestruct value="1610--"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct>, the Lady Arabella Stuart, cousin of James I., having contracted a private marriage with William   Seymour, a son of Lord  Beauchamp, was kept a prisoner in the house of  Sir Thomas Parry. She contrived, however, whilst here to correspond with her husband, and the wedded pair managed to effect her removal to  Highgate,<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="402">402</num>.</NOTE> where she remained, under surveillance, in the house of a Mr. Conyers, from whom   she endeavoured to escape to France; but she was caught in the Channel on board ship, and brought back to the Tower to end her days a prisoner.  Her misfortunes--which read like a chapter in a romance-seem to have arisen simply and solely from her nearness to the Crown. Her husband, surviving her by many years, was invested by Charles II. with the Dukedom of Somerset, which had been forfeited by his ancestor, the Protector. 
   <P>Lambeth, as we have already seen in passing through those parts lying about Kennington, has numbered in its time many residents of note. Besides those whose names we have mentioned, there was living here, in the middle of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, <num value="1">one</num> Mr. Morland (afterwards Sir Samuel Morland), a famous mechanist, not unknown as a statesman, and at whose house Charles II. passed the <num value="1">first</num> night of his restoration. It was this person who, while employed as a clerk at Thurloe's chambers in Lincoln's Inn,+ overheard the conversation between the Protector (Cromwell) and Thurloe, in which it was designed to inveigle the king, then an exile at Bruges, and his younger brothers, the Dukes of York and Gloucester, into the Protector's power. Morland, it seems, was asleep at his desk, or was thought to be so; and Cromwell, apprehensive that his conversation had been overheard, drew his dagger, and would have dispatched the slumberer on the spot, had not Thurloe, with some difficulty, prevented him, assuring him that his intended victim was unquestionably asleep, since, to his own knowledge, he had been sitting up <num value="2">two</num> nights together. It had been treacherously intimated to the king and his brothers, through the agency of Sir Richard Willis, that if, on a stated day, they would land on the coast of Sussex, they would be received by a body of <num value="500">five hundred</num> men, which would be augmented the following morning by <num value="2000">two thousand</num> horse. Had they fallen into the snare, it seems that all <num value="3">three</num> would have been shot immediately on reaching the shore. Morland, however, had not been asleep, as was supposed by Thurloe and Cromwell; and through his means the king and his brothers were made acquainted with the design against their lives. We shall have more to say about Sir Samuel Morland when we reach Vauxhall Gardens. 
    <P>In spite of the vicinity of the archbishop's palace,  Lambeth, in the latter half of the last century, could reckon among its residents some of the most zealous members of the Wesleyan body; and John  Wesley preached in Lambeth Chapel, opposite  Bethlehem Hospital, on <datestruct VALUE="1791-02-17"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=17>17th</day>, <year reg=1791>1791</year></datestruct>, only <num value="1">one</num> brief fortnight before his death.<NOTE>See Vol III., p. <num value="53">53</num>.</NOTE>

    <P>Apparently, <num value="2">two</num> centuries ago, when there was only <num value="1">one</num> bridge across the Thames, Lambeth was the place from which the Portsmouth coach, and <pb id="P.387" n="387"> probably most of the other conveyances to Hampshire and   Dorsetshire, started. At all events, Pepys writes in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date <datestruct value="1660"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>We took water for Lambeth, and there coach for Portsmouth.</QUOTE> On another occasion he tells us that he crossed the water to Lambeth in order to make a journey by land to Woolwich. 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.387.1">Statue of Thames</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>Lambeth was a great place for boat-building as far back, certainly, as the reign of Charles II. At all events, Samuel Pepys tells us in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date <datestruct VALUE="1662-08-13"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=13>13th</day>, <year reg=1662>1662</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>To Lambeth, and there saw the little pleasure-boat in building by the king, my Lord Brouncker, and the <hi rend=italics>virtuosos</hi> of the town, according to new lines, which Mr. Pett cries up mightily; but how it will prove we shall soon see.</QUOTE> We have already met with Mr. Commissioner Pett in our saunterings through Deptford.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="148">148</num>.</NOTE>

   <P>Apart from its boat-building, which was carried on here to a large extent until the formation of the southern   or Albert Embankment, Lambeth has long been <num value="1">one</num> of the principal points on the Thames, above bridge, for the traffic both of watermen and the more modern steamboat conveyance.   Searle's boat-yard, just above Westminster Bridge, on the spot now covered by the Albert Embankment, in front of St. Thomas's Hospital, was a place as familiar to the boating men of Oxford in the last generation as the <QUOTE>Ship</QUOTE> at Mortlake, or the <QUOTE>Star and Garter</QUOTE> at Putney are now. Messrs. Searle's boat-yard has of late years been removed to another site higher up the river, at Stangate, close to Lambeth Bridge. 
   <P>We have described the marshy nature of the land lying between the river and St. George's Fields in former times. Lambeth Marsh--for by such name the locality was known--was protected from the incursion of the river by embankments. At a very early date banks of earth were erected along the south side of the Thames, in order to keep out the tidal waters, and to hold them in check. Our readers will not have forgotten that <num value="1">one</num> locality in Southwark still retains the name of Bankside.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="45">45</num>.</NOTE>
Other embankments, too, were raised, in order to assist in keeping the inland district from inundation, and to form causeways for passengers travelling from Lambeth to London Bridge and the several landing-places along the river-side. Of these embankments, <num value="1">one</num> running nearly parallel with the river was called Narrow Wall; another, bounding the marsh on the east, Broad Wall; and an ancient raised road, probably as old as the time of the Roman occupation, followed the line of the street now known as Lambeth, or Lower Marsh. 
    <P>Lambert, in his <QUOTE>History of Surrey</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>), tells us that on <QUOTE>Narrow Wall</QUOTE> is a manufactory of artificial stone, established in <datestruct value="1769--"><year reg="1769">1769</year></datestruct> by Mr. Coade. <QUOTE>The preparation,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>is cast in moulds and burnt, and is intended to answer every purpose of carved stone.   It is possessed of the peculiar property of resisting frost, and consequently it retains its sharpness, in which it excels every species of stone, and even equals marble.</QUOTE> 
   <P>About <datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct> a sculptured bas-relief (<num value="2">2</num> feet by <num value="2">2</num> feet, and <num value="4">4</num> inches thick) was found in the course of excavations for deep foundation at Broad Wall. It represented the figure of a chief, attired and armed as if for the chase, with certain attributes of costume of a non-European (perhaps American) character, such as a deep fringe round the loins, and strings of beads on the neck, arms, and legs. The spot where it was found was formerly a bog; and it is supposed by the Archaeological Institute to be part of the cargo of a vessel broken upon the spot many ages ago. 
   <P>There were, even as late as the beginning of the present century, open fields, with <LEMMA id="lemma.388.1">a windmill</LEMMA>, where now the renowned <QUOTE>New Cut</QUOTE> connects the Blackfriars and Waterloo Roads. Mill Street, which was pulled down on the formation of the South-Western Railway, marked the site whereon stood a group of picturesque old wooden mills. The spot between the Belvedere Road and the river, between Waterloo and Westminster Bridgestill recently known as Pedlar's Acre--was called, in the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> and <num value="16">sixteenth</num> centuries, Church Osiers, from a large osier-bed which occupied the spot. This is a plot of ground of some historical notoriety, though of no great importance. It was originally a small strip of land, <num value="1">one</num> acre and <num value="9">nine</num> poles in extent, situate alongside of the Narrow Wall, and has belonged to the parish of Lambeth from   time immemorial.   It is said to have been given by a grateful pedlar, on condition that his portrait and that of his dog should be preserved for ever, in painted glass, in <num value="1">one</num> of the windows of the parish church.   This request has been duly observed down to our own day, for the picture was, till lately, to be seen in <num value="1">one</num> of the windows of the church, and some amusing legendary tales are still told about the pedlar of Lambeth and his dog.   Whatever truth there may be in the tradition that the ground in question was bequeathed to the parish by <LEMMA id="lemma.388.2">a pedlar, on condition that the picture of himself and his dog be preserved in the window of the church</LEMMA>, we will not pretend to determine.   Astute antiquaries, how, ever, have searched the parish registers, and there find that the land was bequeathed by some person <pb id="P.388" n="388"> unknown.<NOTE>There is a similar tradition of a pedlar being a benefactor to the parish of Swaffham, in Norfolk.</NOTE>
   On Pedlar's Acre was at <num value="1">one</num> time a public-house, with the sign of a pedlar and his dog; and on a pane of glass in <num value="1">one</num> of the windows in the tap-room the following lines were written with a diamond:-- 
    <QUOTE REND=blockquote>Happy the pedlar whose portrait we view,       Since his dog was so faithful and fortunate too;       He at once made him wealthy, and guarded his door,       Secured him from robbers, relieved him when poor.       Then drink to his memory, and wish fate may send       Such a dog to protect you, enrich, and befriend.</QUOTE>
 <num value="1">One</num> of the windows of Lambeth Church also used to contain a figure of the pedlar. 
     <P>Hereabouts lived and died an eccentric character,  Henry Paulet, commonly known as <QUOTE>Duke of  Bolton,   King of Vine Street, and Governor of  Lambeth Marsh.</QUOTE> He had in early life performed services to the Government in America, and subsequently had assisted Admiral Hawke in defeating a French fleet off Brest; but he chose to take up his abode here in retirement and in the practice of charity towards his poorer neighbours. <QUOTE>As to the good which he did with his income,</QUOTE> writes the author of <QUOTE>The Eccentric,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>there is not a poor man or woman in the neighbourhood of the   Pedlar's Acre who does not testify with gratitude to some act of benevolence performed for the alleviation of his or her poverty by the hand of this humane and heroic Englishman.</QUOTE> 
     <P>Belvedere Road probably takes its name from the Belvedere House and Gardens, a well-known place of amusement, dating from Queen Anne's time, but of which few records remain. These gardens are not mentioned by Malcolm, nor by   John Tinibs, in his <QUOTE>Curiosities of London,</QUOTE> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.388" n="2000.14.0142"><HEAD> The Pedlar And His Dog, Formerly In Lambeth Church.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 who simply tells us that Lambeth in former days <QUOTE>abounded in gardens.</QUOTE> The Belvedere Gardens, we may add, are likewise passed over without a word by Pennant, Northouck, and Lambert. 
   <P>Adjoining Belvedere Gardens, not far from the southern end of Waterloo Bridge, on the site now occupied by the timber-wharves of Belvedere Road, and close by the Lion Brewery, which abuts upon the river, stood formerly a noted place of public resort, known as Cuper's Gardens, and constantly alluded to by writers in the eighteenth century. As far back as the beginning of the eighteenth century, if not earlier; it was famous for its displays of fireworks. <QUOTE>It was not, however,</QUOTE> says Dr. C. Mackay, in his <QUOTE>Thames and its Tributaries,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>the resort of respectable company, but of the abandoned of either sex.</QUOTE> It is frequently mentioned in the comedies and satires of the day as bearing a very indifferent character.   Dr. Mackay lets us into a little of the antiquarianism of the place, for he tells us that it took its name from Boydell Cuper, who had been gardener to Lord Arundel on the other side of the river, and who rented the ground from his lordship.   In our account of Arundel House<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="71">71</num>.</NOTE>
we mentioned that it was adorned with a variety of busts and statues; and it appears that when that house was. pulled down in order to build new streets, a number of these statues, in a more or less mutilated state, came into Cuper's possession, and were set up in different parts of his gardens. This place of entertainment was suppressed by the authority of the magistrates in <datestruct value="1753--"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct>.   It is described by Mr. J. H. Jesse as <QUOTE>a favourite place of resort for the gay and profligate from the end of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> to the middle of the eighteenth century.</QUOTE> It must have somewhat resembled the <QUOTE>Spring Garden</QUOTE> at Charing Cross, if it be true, as stated by Mr. Jesse, that <QUOTE>the principal attractions of the gardens were their retired arbours, their shady walks ornamented with statues and ancient marbles, and   especially the fireworks.</QUOTE> The trees which threw   their shade upon these walks were standing, at all events, as late as <datestruct value="1770"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, for they are shown in the etching which we reproduce on page <num value="384">384</num>, the view of which is taken from the top of the newly-built Adelphi Terrace. The banks of the river, as shown in our illustration, were at that time steep and irregular, and the houses few and far between where now is all the bustle of the Waterloo Railway Station. A print of Cuper's Gardens is in existence, showing the groves, alcoves, and statues with which it was adorned.   Some of the plane-trees belonging to <pb id="P.389" n="389"> these gardens are still green and flourishing in the grounds behind St. John's Church, Waterloo Road; and the name of the place is still preserved in Cuper's Stairs, nearly opposite the Adelphi. Part of the site of Cuper's Gardens was afterwards occupied by Beaufoy's vinegar works and manufactory of British wines,<NOTE>See Pennant's <QUOTE>London.</QUOTE> </NOTE> till the formation of Waterloo Bridge and its approaches cleared the spot, and forced Beaufoy to retreat further south. 
    <P>Besides the gardens above mentioned, several other places for open-air entertainment were established in Lambeth in the latter part of the last century. The Duke of Cumberland, the <QUOTE>butcher</QUOTE> hero of Culloden, gave name to some gardens by the river-side, not far from <num value="9">Nine</num> Elms, which existed till <datestruct value="1813"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, when they were destroyed on the formation of Vauxhall Bridge Road. The  Hercules Inn and Gardens were at the junction of the Kennington and Westminster Roads, on the spot afterwards occupied by the Female Orphan  Asylum, and now by Christ Church. The gardens were opened as a place of public resort in the year <datestruct value="1758"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>; their memory is still perpetuated by  Hercules Buildings, in Westminster Bridge Road.  Nearly opposite, close to where Messrs. Maudslay's engineering works now stand, as we have already had occasion to state, early in the present century, built upon piles in a swamp, were the Apollo  Gardens, opened in <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct> by Mr. Cloggett, proprietor of the fashionable Pantheon in Oxford  Street. Here there was a central orchestra, and alcoves with snug wooden boxes all around, containing grotesque and amusing pictures and sculptures. In the same year the Flora Gardens were opened in Mount Street; but in <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> years these places had acquired such an evil repute that the magistrates repressed them. 
   <P>The Lambeth Fields were for <num value="2">two</num> centuries a favourite resort of Londoners, and celebrated for the variety of sweet-smelling flowers and medicinal herbs growing there. Near the Upper Marsh was Curtis's great botanical garden, on the spot where in. the old times had stood a lazar-house. 
   <P>In the reign of William III. there was another place of amusement, known as <QUOTE>Lambeth Wells,</QUOTE> in what is now   Lambeth Walk, but was then termed <num value="3">Three</num> Coney Walk; they were held for a time in high repute, on account of their mineral waters, which were advertised as to be sold, according to John Timbs, at <QUOTE>a penny a quart, the same price paid by St. Thomas's Hospital.</QUOTE> About <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>, we learn from the same authority, there was a musical society held here, and lectures, with experiments in natural philosophy, were delivered by Dr. Erasmus King and others.   Malcolm tells us that the Wells opened for the season regularly on Easter Monday, being closed during the winter.  They had <QUOTE>public days</QUOTE> on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, with <QUOTE>music from   <num value="7">seven</num> in the morning till sunset; on other days till <num value="2">two</num>!</QUOTE> The price of admission was threepence. The water was sold at a penny a quart to the <QUOTE>quality</QUOTE> and to those who could pay for it; being given <hi rend=italics>gratis</hi>
to the poor. We incidentally learn that there were grand gala and dancing days here in <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1752--"><year reg="1752">1752</year></datestruct>, when <QUOTE>a penny wedding, in the Scotch manner, was celebrated for the benefit of a young couple.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The following notice was issued in some of the public papers in <datestruct VALUE="1710-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct>   :-- <QUOTE>A gold ring is to be danced for on the <num value="31">31st</num> instant, and a hat to be played for at skittles the next day following, at the  <Q> Green Gate,</Q> ,in Gray's Walks, near Lambeth Wells.</QUOTE> About this time, Lambeth Marsh, close by, and the fields round about, were the scene of out-door diversion and merry-making during the summer months, running matches and <QUOTE>grinning</QUOTE> matches being of frequent occurrence. 
   <P><hi rend=italics>Apropos</hi> of these gatherings for social enjoyment, the following quotation from Fielding's <QUOTE>Proverbs</QUOTE> may not be out of place here, as Lambeth was <num value="1">one</num> of the head-quarters of amusement for the citizens of London:-- <QUOTE>In addition to the May games, morris-dancing, pageants, and processions, which were common throughout the kingdom, the Iondoners,</QUOTE> he tells us, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>had peculiar privileges of hunting, hawking, and fishing; they had also large portions of ground allotted to them in the vicinity of the City for the practice of such pastimes as were not prohibited, and for those, especially, that were conducive to health. On the holidays, during the summer season, the young men exercised themselves in the fields with leaping, archery, wrestling, playing with balls, and practising with their wasters and bucklers. The City damsels had also their recreations, playing upon their timbrels and dancing to the music, which they Often practised by moonlight.   <num value="1">One</num> writer says it was customary for the maidens to dance in presence of their masters and mistresses, while <num value="1">one</num> of their companions played the music on a timbrel; and to stimulate them, the best dancers were rewarded with a garland, the prize being exposed to public view during the performance. To this custom Spenser alludes- 
               <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L part=f>The damsels they delight, 
            <L>When they their timbrels smite, 
            <L>And thereunto dance and carol sweet.</QUOTE>
 <pb id="P.390" n="390"> The London apprentices often amused themselves with their wasters and bucklers before the doors of their masters. Hunting with the Lord Mayor's pack of hounds was a diversion of the metropolis, as well as sailing, rowing, and fishing on the Thames.   Duck-hunting was a favourite recreation in the summer, as we learn from Strype.</QUOTE>

   <P>Among the other sports which   prevailed   in Lambeth, in the days of <QUOTE>Merrye Englande,</QUOTE> was that of <QUOTE>hocking,</QUOTE> or catching and binding with ropes the passers-by in the street. The men <QUOTE>hocked</QUOTE> the women, and the women the men; and each had to pay a small fine on being released. Strutt tells us, in his <QUOTE>Sports and Pastimes,</QUOTE> that <QUOTE>Hock-Day</QUOTE> was celebrated probably in remembrance of the death   of Hardicanute, already mentioned, which delivered England from   the tyranny of the Danes.   In the churchwardens' accounts of Lambeth for <datestruct value="1515--"><year reg="1515">1515</year></datestruct> and the following year are several entries of <QUOTE>hock-monies</QUOTE> received from   the men and the women for the church service. <QUOTE>And   here we may observe,</QUOTE> adds Strutt, with a stroke of dry humour, <QUOTE>the contributions collected by the fair sex exceeded those made by the men,</QUOTE>

   <P>Since the <num value="1">first</num> formation of streets in the place of the fields and marshy ground hereabouts, Lam. beth, like most other water-side places, has not been behind-hand in the number of its publichouses, some of which have acquired more than a local reputation. From a manuscript list, written about the year <datestruct value="1810"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, we glean the following particulars of its tavern signs :--In Westminster Bridge Road, the <QUOTE>Army and Navy,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>King's Head,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Rose,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Crown,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Red Lion,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Dover Castle,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Canterbury Arms,</QUOTE> and the <QUOTE>New Crown and Cushion.</QUOTE> In Coburg Road, the <QUOTE><num value="3">Three</num> Compasses</QUOTE> and the <QUOTE>Olive Branch.</QUOTE> In Coburg Place, the <QUOTE>Queen's Arms</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>The Pilgrim.</QUOTE> In Broad Wall, the <QUOTE>Mitre</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>The Bull in the Pound</QUOTE> --the latter of which points to the time when a bull was liable to be punished for trespass, and put into the pound or pinfold.

Alien tells us, in his <QUOTE>History of Lambeth,</QUOTE> that when this inn underwent repairs in <datestruct value="1752--"><year reg="1752">1752</year></datestruct>, there was found in it a remarkable arm-chair, with high elbows, covered with purple cloth, and ornamented with gilt nails. <QUOTE>An old fisherman,</QUOTE> adds Mr. Allen, <QUOTE>told Mr. Buckmaster that he had heard his grandfather say that Charles II. used to frequent this tavern in disguise, on his water-tours along with his ladies, in order to play chess, &amp;c., and that the chair found was the same in which the king sat. The royal chair was repaired, and kept as a curiosity by the late Mr. John Dawson, but was destroyed at the pulling down of his old dwelling in Vauxhall. Mr. Buckmaster sat in the chair many times; but his feet would not touch the ground.</QUOTE> King Charles, it will be remembered, was very tall in stature: a fact which strongly corroborates the idea that the chair was not only sat upon by his Majesty, but also designed and made for his special use. 
   <P> <QUOTE>The <num value="3">Three</num> Squirrels</QUOTE> was the sign of an inn here, mentioned by Taylor, the water-poet, in <datestruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></datestruct>, but its exact locality is not known.   The same sign is still to be seen over Messrs. Goslings', the bankers, in Fleet Street. 
   <P>In Calcot's Alley was formerly an inn which bore the sign of the <QUOTE>Chequers.</QUOTE> It is worthy of note here, on account of a fact connected with it, mentioned by Allen, in his <QUOTE>History of Lambeth,</QUOTE> viz., that in <datestruct value="1454--"><year reg="1454">1454</year></datestruct> its owner, <num value="1">one</num> John Calcot, had granted to him a licence to have an oratory in his house, and a chaplain for the use of his family and guests, and adapted to the celebration of divine service as long as his house should continue to be orderly and respectable.

 Lambeth, we may add, could boast of its Halfpenny Hatch as late as the commencement of the present century. It led from Christ Church, in the Blackfriars Road, to the Marsh Gate, near  Westminster Bridge, over some fields where now stands St. John's Church, Waterloo Road. 
    <P>Here Astley <num value="1">first</num> exhibited his horses, before taking the ground near Westminster Bridge which has since been associated with his name.   The  Hatch House was at the back of St. John's Church, at the end of Neptune Place, and its forlorn and ramshackle condition is graphically described by  Mr. John   T.

<P>Unlike Covent Garden, the Haymarket, and other <QUOTE>West-end</QUOTE> houses, the <QUOTE>Transpontine</QUOTE> theatres have always been chiefly remarkable for spectacular or <QUOTE>sensational</QUOTE> performances : in a word, for such entertainments as appeal more to the eye than to the understanding; for, as may be easily imagined, their managers--in some of them, at least--have to cater altogether for a different constituency from that which forms the support of the old patent theatres, and generally those of the West-end. With reference   to   the   morality of the transpontine theatres, Charles Knight wrote, in his <hi rend=italics>Penny Magazine</hi>, in <datestruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct>: <QUOTE>Look at our theatres; look at the houses all around them.   Have they not given a taint to the very districts they belong to? The Coburg Theatre, now called the Victoria, and the Surrey, what are they? At Christmas time, at each of these minor theatres, may be seen such   an appalling amount of loathsome vice and depravity as goes beyond Eugene Sue, and justifies the most astounding   revelations   of Smollett.</QUOTE> Happily, matters have mended considerably since he wrote, and the vicinity of even a minor theatre is now by no means so absolutely and hopelessly depraved. Allusions to the transpontine places of entertainment are common enough in the writings of the last generation; and the authors of the <QUOTE>Rejected Addresses,</QUOTE> published in the year <datestruct value="1812"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, in mockheroic style, attribute, of course in jest, the burning of so many of our places of amusement to the archenemy, Napoleon Bonaparte! 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Base Bonaparte, fill'd with deadly ire,

   <P>Of the <QUOTE>Surrey</QUOTE> we have already written at length in a previous chapter <NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="368">368</num>.</NOTE>   it now remains for us to deal with the <QUOTE>Victoria</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>Astley's.</QUOTE> The Victoria Theatre, formerly called the Coburg, and in more recent times the Royal Victoria Palace Theatre, is situated in the Waterloo Road, at the corner of the New Cut, and not far from the South- Western Railway Station. 
   <P>The building of Waterloo Bridge, which was commenced in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, and was completed <num value="6">six</num> years afterwards, led to the erection of this theatre, which was originally called the <QUOTE><LEMMA id="lemma.393.3">Coburg</LEMMA>,</QUOTE> in compliment to Prince Leopold of Saxe Coburg (afterwards King of the Belgians), the husband of the Princess Charlotte. The <num value="1">first</num> stone was laid by the prince, by proxy, in <datestruct VALUE="1817-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>, and the theatre was opened on Whit-Monday in the following May. No doubt, a desire on the part of dramatists and performers to escape from the vexatious restrictions then (and still) imposed by the Lord Chamberlain on theatres within his jurisdiction was largely instrumental in procuring the erection of this and of the Surrey Theatre. The builder of the structure was an ingenious carpenter, a Frenchman, named Cabanelle,<NOTE>This foreigner had constructed the stage of Drury Lane Theatre, and had also invented a peculiar kind of roof for large buildings, which was called by his name.</NOTE> who arranged it after the fashion of a minor French theatre, nearly circular in shape, decorating the interior with strong contrasts of colour.   Few persons, in all probability, are aware that the foundations of the theatre are extensively composed of the stones of the old Savoy Palace in the Strand, which were cleared away in order to form Lancaster Place.<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="286">286</num>.</NOTE>

    <P>The <QUOTE>Coburg</QUOTE> was built with a due regard to the character of the population by which it was surrounded, and was therefore designed for melodramas and pantomimes; and, on the whole, it has adhered pretty closely to its original purpose, under a variety of lessees and managers.   Among the pieces performed on the opening night was <hi rend=italics>Trial</hi>
 <pb id="P.394" n="394"> 
<hi rend=italics>by Battle; ; or, Heaven Defend the Right</hi>, based on the memorable appeal made by the brothers of Mary Ashford against her murderer, Abraham Thornton, the applicants' right to a <QUOTE>trial by wager of battle</QUOTE> having been acknowledged by the Court of King's Bench only a month previously. At the end of the <num value="1">first</num> season the public were told by the proprietor that it was his intention <QUOTE>to have all the avenues (roads) to the theatre well lighted, while the appointed additional patrols on the bridge road --and keeping them in their own pay--will afford ample security to the patrons of the theatre.</QUOTE> The public were also informed that the theatre was financially successful, though Tom Dibdin states that its opening was a <QUOTE>lamentable circumstance</QUOTE> to both its owners and the lessee of the Surrey; for that each speculation showed a loss of several thousands, whilst <num value="1">one</num> theatre in that neighbourhood might have reaped a large profit. Be this, however, as it may, it is worthy of record that amongst those personages who have appeared on the boards of the Coburg are to be reckoned Edmund Kean (who received <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> for performing here <num value="2">two</num> nights in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>), Booth, T. P. Cooke, Buckstone, Benjamin Webster, Liston, Joe Grimaldi, and G. V. Brooke, the <QUOTE>Hibernian Roscius.</QUOTE> In <datestruct VALUE="1833-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>-with a keen foresight of the future successor to the Crown--the name of the Coburg was changed to that of the <QUOTE>Victoria,</QUOTE> in compliment to the young princess who then stood as heir presumptive to the throne, and the whole of the interior was altered and embellished afresh. In the June of the following year the great violinist, Paganini, performed here for a single night-his last public appearance in this country. A special feature of this theatre, for some years, was its <QUOTE>act drop,</QUOTE> which was neither more nor less than a huge looking-glass. It was lifted up bodily into the roof, where a large box-shaped contrivance was fitted up to receive it. Notwithstanding that the old <QUOTE>Vic</QUOTE> --for so this theatre was popularly called--has in former times numbered among its scene-painters such men as Clarkson Stanfield, the great marine painter, the place does not appear to have been a very fortunate speculation for its managers or lessees, several being ruined by it. 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.394.1">Play Bill of Royal Victoria Theatre, <datestruct VALUE="1833-07--"><month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct></LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>When this theatre <num value="1">first</num> opened its doors, upwards of half a century ago, it was in the presence of a <QUOTE>large and fashionable audience,</QUOTE> if we may believe the newspapers of the day. The piece performed on that occasion, which we have mentioned above, entitled <hi rend=italics>Trial by Battle; or, Heaven Defend the Right</hi>, was described in the play-bills as an entirely new melo-dramatic spectacle, in which was to be portrayed the ancient mode of decision by Kemp fight, or single combat. There followed it a grand Asiatic ballet, and a new and splendid harlequinade (partly from Milton's <hi rend=italics>Masque of Comus</hi>), <QUOTE>with new and extensive machinery, mechanical changes, tricks, and metamorphoses :</QUOTE> and the play-bills concluded with the comfortable assurance, <QUOTE>extra patroles are engaged for the bridge and roads leading to the theatre, and particular attention will be paid to the lighting of the same.</QUOTE> But the <QUOTE>fashionable</QUOTE> audience did not long continue; and the street lamps, the costermongers' lamps of the New Cut, and the vigilance of the metropolitan police, soon rendered unnecessary the <QUOTE>extra patroles</QUOTE> or the manager's <QUOTE>particular attention</QUOTE> being paid to the lighting of the surrounding thoroughfares.   The old <QUOTE>Vic</QUOTE> for many years enjoyed a very doubtful reputation. It was the place of which Charles Mathews once wrote: <QUOTE>The lower orders rush there in mobs, and in shirt-sleeves applaud frantically, drink gingerbeer, munch apples, crack nuts, call the actors by their Christian names, and throw them orangepeel and apples by way of bouquets.</QUOTE> For many years it bore a terribly bad character for fatal accidents from crushing; and a false alarm of fire here caused the deaths of some <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="16">sixteen</num> persons in <datestruct VALUE="1858-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct>. In a few years more, however, a change came, and on the night of the <datestruct VALUE="1871-09-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>, a crowded audience beheld the last of the old Victoria. <QUOTE>It could be seen at a glance,</QUOTE> observes a writer in the <hi rend=italics>Daily News,</hi>
 <QUOTE>that the evening was <num value="1">one</num> to be held in special fashion by the humble dwellers in the New Cut. A cherished institution, dear to them and their children, was doomed, and they had come to take a last fond look, and earn the right of narrating by the winter fire how they had seen the  <Q>Vic</Q>  proud in its glory and triumphant in its expiring moments.   The increase of prices to the extent of threepence in every part of the house had no effect upon the gallery or the pit, so that the precautions taken by the management to open the doors at half-past <num value="5">five</num> were quite necessary   . . . A very laudable desire was felt to do all that could be done that the Victoria Theatre might end its days in peace, and pass to its rest with no fresh disaster on its conscience.   The audience, overawed maybe by the thoughts which seized them, assisted to secure this result.   There, ascending from gallery front into the dim roof, were the lusty roughs, short-sleeved, slop-clothed, and cropped as of yore; but no missiles came from   their hands; no internecine warfare was carried   on, to the mingled delight and terror of the beholders; no oaths resounded from side to side; no Bedlam was <pb id="P.395" n="395"> let loose, as in the olden times when respectable West-enders would not have dared to enter the house without an unquestioned life assurance. The audience at the  <Q>Vic</Q>  has been made to answer the purpose of  <Q>awful warning</Q>  for many a long year, and we will do that of the closing night the justice to say that, composed undoubtedly as it was of persons living in the Lambeth highways and bye-ways, it was, on the whole, as decorous as that of any other house in the metropolis. The few cat-calls that some hardy and unfeeling youths at an early hour indulged in found no response; whistling even was at a discount; and the very children in arms stared wondrously at the dropscene, and rubbed their sticky little knuckles into their sleepy little eyes.</QUOTE> The   theatre on this occasion was roused into a faint semblance of its former self when the foreboding strains of the overture heralded in <QUOTE>a Romantic Drama, entitled the <hi rend=italics>Trial by Battle</hi>,</QUOTE> the chief merit of which was, as we have before stated, that it commenced the entertainment when the theatre was <num value="1">first</num> opened, on the <datestruct VALUE="1818-05-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>.   It was not likely there could have been a single person present on the closing night who was also present when the curtain rose for the <num value="1">first</num> time at the Coburg Theatre, albeit there were several who had seen themselves reflected in the famous mirror curtain, and who could remember the visit of the Princess Victoria and the house's subsequent change of name. The manager, Mr. Cave, offered a chastened, but still appropriate, play-bill for the last night, and engaged some well-known actors to grace the closing scenes. <QUOTE><title>Rob Roy</title>,</QUOTE> observes the writer quoted above, <QUOTE>though not of the bloody and ghostly type of play of which the  <Q> Vic </Q>  was the natural exponent, is so bold in its situations, so full of <Q> Auld-Lang- Syne</Q>  sentiments, and so well seasoned with fighting material, that it could not fail to touch the heart of any genuine frequenter of the  <Q>Vic.</Q>  It is just a little naughty, too: at least, to the extent of a considerable amount of dram-drinking, a fair allowance of cursing and swearing, and a sly approval of lawlessness and contempt for the powers that be.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Rob Roy,</QUOTE> of course, found a host of sympathisers; and what with the capitally-sung songs, the sanguinary conflicts, the sentiment, and the final punishment of the villain <QUOTE>Rashleigh</QUOTE> --enacted, by the way, by <num value="1">one</num> of the <QUOTE>Vic's</QUOTE> regular performers, <QUOTE>a painstaking artist, with fine rolling eye, trembling hand oft raised aloft, strongly heaving bosom, and r's well rolled out from   the inner depths</QUOTE> --the curtain fell to a thunder of applause that seemed to come from <num value="1">one</num> capacious and enthusiastic throat.   The actors were summoned: they departed; and still the applause continued, until the appearance of Mr. Cave sealed the vociferous tongues. The managerial speech was short, unpretentious, and to the point. <num value="1">First</num>, thanks for the patronage he had enjoyed during his <num value="4">four</num> years of management, and then the pathetic statement -- <QUOTE>This evening the curtain will drop for ever upon the Victoria Theatre.</QUOTE> In the next breath Mr. Cave was on with the new love before he was off with the old, inasmuch as he announced that in place of the <QUOTE>Vic</QUOTE> would arise a place of entertainment that would surpass <QUOTE>for magnitude and grandeur</QUOTE> anything the kingdom of Great Britain and   Ireland   ever saw. The godlings shouted <QUOTE>hear, hear!</QUOTE> as knowingly as members of Parliament, on being informed that the best dramas of the period would there be exhibited before the audiences of the future, and broke out into a perfect whirlwind of applause when it was added that the new proprietors did not intend to destroy the speciality of the theatre. The Victoria was henceforth to be half melo-drama and half musichall. Mr. Cave then retired, full of honours; and, as the curtain fell, a mournful-voiced, bare-armed young man in the front row of the gallery audibly summed up the case thus:-- <QUOTE>Ah! the poor old Wic! Pass the arf-an&lsquo;--arf, &lsquo;Arry.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The following description of the closing scenes of the <QUOTE>poor old Wic,</QUOTE> from the pen of an eyewitness, may be read with interest :-- <QUOTE>The audience required but little explanation beforehand as to the last dish of the farewell feast. The bridge over the rocks, the greasy moon overhead, and the smugglers in the foreground, told the entire story the moment the curtain was fairly up. In the <num value="1">first</num> few sentences our dear old friend  <Q>Ongree</Q>  was introduced, closely followed by the equally familiar swarthy ruffian in sea-boots, with enough pistols about him to furnish a troop. Enter, also, a tall baron; next a tottering old man--the feeble father, upon whose only child the bold wicked noble has the worst of designs. In these smuggler bands there is always <num value="1">one</num> buccaneer who plays the part of the repentant sinner, through whose honest treachery by-and-by vice--which is, of course, clothed in velvet and gold --is punished, and virtue-which, equally of course, goes in hunger and rags--is rewarded.   The actor who undertook this character, an old stager in these parts, probably, was mildly requested to open his mouth by <num value="1">one</num> section, and consoled by cries of  <Q> Brayvo Bradshaw-er!</Q>  by another.   He was a weak brother from the smuggler's point of view, and soon got himself into trouble by such heresies as, <Q> Never will I give my consent to bring a virtuous girl to infamy!</Q> --a bit of oratory that drew <pb id="P.396" n="396"> loud expressions of approval from the only drunken man to be seen among the <num value="1500">1,500</num> persons crammed into the upper regions. The  <Q> Vic</Q>  by this time was itself again. Shouts were answered by shrill whistlings, and the voices that <num value="1">one</num> moment yelled  <Q>Go it, my pippin!</Q>  were the readiest, the next, to howl,  <Q>Turn him out!</Q>  Sentiment was thrown to the winds. The repentant smuggler's glib boast,  <Q>Though I am a poor smuggler, I am yet a man!</Q>  was decidedly gibed at, all approval being reserved for the unscrupulous villain--the tool of the baron --who, without any hesitation, swore he cared for nothing in the world so long as he got  <Q> the rhino.</Q>  The plotting of the village girl's abduction by the smugglers was a sore test of patience. The pit and other parts of the house admonished the occupants of the gallery to be quiet, but to no purpose. There was an under-tone of discontent which would not be allayed. The troubled waters were calmed by the sudden change of the music from the dirgeful to the thunder-and-lightning order of melody, such as precedes the opening of the trapdoor on Boxing-night, and the advent of a herd of demons.   The expected tragedy not happening on the instant, the discontent waxed louder, yet not

 boisterous by any means. Mr. Cave seemed to think differently, for he shot like an arrow from the right wing, and rebuked the noisy portion of his patrons, hinting to them that the melo-drama had not been produced for larksome purposes, but to give them a taste of the ancient quality. A decentlooking man in the pit here made a remark, showing that he resented the extra prices which had been imposed; and Mr. Cave quietly reminded the grievance-monger that if he had been there when the play was <num value="1">first</num> produced, he would have had to pay <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings</measure> for his seat.</QUOTE> The piece hereafter proceeded with moderate interruptions only; but when the curtain fell and the theatre was cleared, there was a desolate look on the faces of the vast crowd that lingered outside--it might have been caused by the paltry number of <num value="4">four</num> deaths during the melo-drama; or by the fact that the publichouses were closed; or, peradventure, because the people had seen the last of the <QUOTE>Vic.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The old theatre, a few days later, was again opened; but the principal actor on this occasion was the auctioneer, whose rostrum was erected on the stage, amidst heaps of <QUOTE>properties</QUOTE> and other articles.   The stage, with all its traps, fittings, <pb id="P.397" n="397">

The building, however, was re-opened at the Christmas of the same year, under the altered and enlarged designation of the <QUOTE>Royal Victoria Palace Theatre,</QUOTE> its interior having been entirely re-constructed and handsomely decorated by a new proprietary; but its success was very transient, for in <datestruct VALUE="1874-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>, it was again offered for sale by auction. The following description of the building we quote from the announcement of the sale :-- <QUOTE>The approaches to the theatre are <num value="6">six</num> in number, and afford ample and safe means by stone staircases for the rapid entrance and exit of crowded audiences, while the water supply is from <num value="5">five</num> hydrants, attached to the high pressure main service, and <num value="3">three</num> large cisterns. The interior arrangements are complete, and include the noble, lofty, and well-ventilated auditorium, of unique design, rising to a height of <num value="50">50</num> feet, decorated in the Italian style, the walls being effectively lined with brilliant silvered plate-glass, and consisting of <num value="12">twelve</num> large private boxes,   <num value="117">117</num> stalls, <num value="119">119</num> balcony seats, with promenade to hold <num value="250">250</num> more, <num value="560">560</num> in pit, with promenade affording space for <num value="400">400</num> more, and accommodation for <num value="800">800</num> to <num value="850">850</num> in gallery, thus affording, at present, accommodation for <num value="2300">2,300</num> persons, but with a judicious outlay it is calculated that additional sitting room may be obtained for <num value="500">500</num> more visitors, thus giving a total audience of <num value="2800">2,800</num> persons.   There are lofty, spacious, and appropriately-decorated refreshment-rooms adjoining the stalls, balcony, pit, and gallery, the whole being lighted by <num value="500">500</num> jet burners, fixed to the roof, in a ring <num value="96">96</num> feet in circumference.   The proscenium is an elliptic arch, of handsome character, <num value="38">38</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches wide and <num value="34">34</num> feet high.

   <P>The <QUOTE>Vic</QUOTE> --or by whatever other name this theatre has been   known      has indeed had   a chequered existence, and <num value="1">one</num> sad romantic tale at least is connected with it.   A Miss Vincent, <num value="1">one</num> of its managers, married a poor actor; but his head was so turned by his good fortune, that he was taken straight from the bridal party at the church doors to a lunatic asylum; and Miss Vincent died not long afterwards.

Alphonse Esquiros, in his <QUOTE>English at Home,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>it was only a circus, started by Philip Astley, who had been a light horseman in General Elliott's regiment. . . . Astley's Amphitheatre, as it is called, though it has undergone various transformations since the death of its founder, is still (<datestruct value="1862"><year reg="1862">1862</year></datestruct>) a celebrated place for equestrian performances, exhibitions of trained ponies, elephants, dancing the tight rope, and even wild beasts, more or less tamed.   I saw performed there a grand spectacle, in which appeared a lion that had killed a man on the night before.   This painful circumstance, as may be believed, added a feeling of sadness and a species of tragic interest to the performance.   The principal actor--I mean the lion-expressed no remorse for what he had done on the previous night; his face was calm   and even benignant; he performed   his part as if nothing had happened, and he followed the lionconqueror (Van Amburgh) through the various situations of the piece.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Mr. Frost, in his <title>Old Showmen</title>, gives the following account of the   amphitheatre and its founder:--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Down to the end of the last century there are no records of a circus having appeared at the London fairs.   Astley is said to have taken his stud and company to Bartholomew   Fair at <num value="1">one</num> time, but I have not succeeded in finding any bill or advertisement of the great equestrian in connection with fairs.   The amphitheatre which has always borne his name (except during the lesseeship of Mr. Boucicault, who chose to call it the Westminster Theatre, a title about as appropriate as the Marylebone would be in Shoreditch) was opened in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, and he had previously given open-air performances on the same site, only the seats being roofed over. The enterprising character of Astley renders it not improbable that he may have tried his fortune at the fairs when the circus was closed, as it has usually been during the summer; and he may not have commenced his season at the amphitheatre until after Bartholomew Fair, or have given there a performance which he was accustomed to give in the afternoon at a large <pb id="P.399" n="399"> room   in Piccadilly, where the tricks of a performing horse were varied with conjuring and 
<hi rend=italics>Ombres Chinoises</hi>, a kind of shadow-pantomime. But, though Astley's was the <num value="1">first</num> circus erected in England, equestrian performances in the open air had been given before his time by Price and Sampson. The site of Dobney's Place, at the back of Penton Street, Islington, was, in the middle of the last century, a tea-garden and bowling-green, to which Johnstown, who leased the premises in <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>, added the attraction of tumbling and ropedancing   performances, which had become so popular at Sadler's Wells. Price commenced his equestrian performances at this place in <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, and soon had a rival in Sampson, who performed singular feats in a field behind the <Q>Old Hats</Q>
public-house. It was not until later, according to the historians of Lambeth, that Philip Astley exhibited his feats of horsemanship in a field near the Halfpenny Hatch, forming his <num value="1">first</num> ring with a rope and stakes, after the manner of the mountebanks of a later day, and going round with his hat after each performance to collect the largesses of the spectators: a part of the business which, in the slang of strolling acrobats and other entertainers of the public in bye-streets and market-places and on village greens, is called  <Q>doing a mob.</Q>  
    <P>This remarkable man was born in <datestruct value="1742--"><year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct>, at Newcastle-under-Lyme, where his father carried on the business of a cabinet-maker.   He received little or no education--no uncommon thing at that time --and, having worked a few years with his father, enlisted in a cavalry regiment. His imposing appearance, being over <num value="6">six</num> feet in height, with the proportions of a Hercules and the voice of a Stentor, attracted attention to him; his capture of a standard at the battle of Ensdorff made him <num value="1">one</num> of the celebrities of his regiment. While serving in the army, he learnt many feats of horsemanship from an itinerant equestrian named Johnson, and often exhibited them for the amusement of his comrades.   On his discharge from the army, being presented by General Eliott with a horse, he bought another in Smithfield, and with these <num value="2">two</num> animals gave the open-air performances in Lambeth which have been mentioned.</QUOTE>

   <P>Next to Lord Granby and the Duke of Wellington, the most popular hero, if we may judge from his occurrence on sign-boards, was General Eliott, Lord Heathfield. Larwood ascribes this popularity in London to a curious cause--the gift of his white charger <QUOTE>Gibraltar</QUOTE> to Mr. Astley. This horse, he remarks, performing every night in the ring, and shining forth in the circus bills, would certainly act as an excellent <QUOTE>puff</QUOTE> for the general's glory. 
    <P>Philip Astley received his discharge from the army in <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct>, and exhibited in the country for about <num value="2">two</num> years, till he considered himself capable of appearing before a London assemblage of spectators. He then set up what he termed a Riding  School-merely a piece of ground enclosed by a slight paling-near a pathway that led through the fields from Blackfriars to Westminster Bridge. The terminus of the South-Western Railway now nearly, if not exactly, covers the spot. The <num value="1">first</num> bill of performance that he issued here is as follows:-- <QUOTE>ACTIVITY on horseback of Mr. Astley, Serjeant-  Major in His Majesty's Royal Regiment of Light  Dragoons.   Nearly <num value="20">twenty</num> different attitudes will be performed on <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="2">two</num>, and <num value="3">three</num> horses, every evening during the summer, at his riding school.  Doors to be open at <num value="4">four</num>, and he will mount at <num value="5">five</num>.   Seats, <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure>; standing places, sixpence.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Early every evening Mr. Astley, dressed in full military uniform, and mounted on his white charger, took up a position at the south end of Westminster  Bridge, to distribute bills and point out with his sword the pathway through the fields that led to his riding school. That it was a <QUOTE>school</QUOTE> in reality as well as name, we learn from the following advertisement:-- <QUOTE><EMPH rend=caps>The True and Perfect Seat on  Horseback</emph>.-There is no creature yields so much profit as the horse; and if he is made obedient to the hand and spur, it is the chief thing that is aimed at. Mr. Astley undertakes to break in the most vicious horse in the kingdom, for the road or field, to stand fire, drums, &amp;c.; and those intended for ladies to canter easy. His method, between the jockey and the <hi rend=italics>menage</hi>, is peculiar to himself; no gentleman need despair of being a complete horseman that follows his directions, having <num value="8">eight</num> years' experience in General Eliott's regiment. For half-a-guinea he makes known his method of learning (teaching) any horse to lay <hi rend=italics>(sic)</hi>
down at the word of command, and defies any <num value="1">one</num> to equal it for safety and ease.</QUOTE> 
   <P>An information was soon lodged against Mr. Astley for receiving money from persons witnessing his feats of horsemanship, when, fortunately for him, George III. was riding over Westminster Bridge on a spirited horse, which proved restive and unmanageable even by the king, who was an excellent horseman. Astley happening to see him, came up, and soon convinced his Majesty of his skill in the managing of horses: the result was that he got rid of the information, and in a few days obtained a licence. 
   <P>From   the <num value="1">first</num> Astley saw that his performances were deficient in variety; so by energetic teaching <pb id="P.400" n="400"> he soon made <num value="2">two</num> other excellent performers: his wife and the white charger. To make the most of the horse's performance, he interlarded it with some verses of his own composition. Introducing the animal, and ordering it to lie down, he would thus address the audience :-- 
   <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>My horse lies dead apparent in your sight,

   <P>The riding school being uncovered, there were but few   spectators on wet evenings; but, as a partial remedy for this drawback, Mr. Astley ran up a shed, for admission to which he charged <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure>.   He was soon enabled to invest <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure>, as mortgage, on a piece of ground near Westminster Bridge.   Good fortune followed.   The mortgagor went abroad, leaving a quantity of timber on the ground, and, so far as is known, was never heard of afterwards. About the same time, too, Astley found on Westminster Bridge a diamond ring, worth <num value="70">seventy</num> guineas, that was never claimed by the loser.   With this assistance he erected a new riding school on the piece of mortgaged ground ever since associated with his name. This place was open at the top; but next the road there was a wooden edifice, the lower part of which formed stables, the upper, termed <QUOTE>the long room,</QUOTE> holding reserved seats for the gentry. A pent-house partly covered the seats round the ride; and the principal spectators being thus under cover, Astley now advertised to perform <QUOTE>every evening, wet or dry.</QUOTE> We give on page <num value="397">397</num> <num value="2">two</num> views of this structure from Mr. J. T. Smith's <QUOTE>Historical and Literary Curiosities.</QUOTE> The entrance was reached by steps from the road, and a green curtain covered the door, where Mrs. Astley stood to take the money. To the whitewashed walls were affixed some pictorial representations of the performances; and along the top of the building were figures of horses, with riders in various attitudes: these were made of wood and painted.   This new house was opened about the year <datestruct value="1770"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, and <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> bills relating to it states that <QUOTE>Mr. Astley exhibits, at full speed, the different cuts and guards made use of by Eliott's, the Prussian, and the Hessian Hussars. Also the manner of Eliott's charging the French troops in Germany, in the year <datestruct value="1761"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>, when it was said the regiment were all tailors.</QUOTE> 
   <P>About the same time, increasing his company, he was enabled to give more diversity to his entertainment; and <num value="1">one</num> of the most successful sketches which he introduced was that timehonoured delight of rustics and children, <hi rend=italics>Billy Button's Ride to Brentford</hi>.   Master Astley, then but <num value="5">five</num> years old, made his <num value="1">first</num> appearance, riding on <num value="2">two</num> horses. At this period Mr. Astley used to parade the West-end streets on the days of performance.   He led the procession, in military uniform, on his white charger, followed by <num value="2">two</num> trumpeters; to these succeeded <num value="2">two</num> riders in full costume, the rear being brought up by a coach, in which the clown and a <QUOTE>learned pony</QUOTE> sat and distributed handbills. This, however, did not long continue, for Mr. Astley soon announced that he had given up parading, <QUOTE>and never more intends that abominable practice.</QUOTE> 
   <P> <QUOTE>Whitefield never drew as much attention as a mountebank does,</QUOTE> writes Boswell, in his <QUOTE>Life of Johnson;</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>he did not draw attention by doing better than others, but by doing what was strange. Were Astley to preach a sermon, standing upon his head on a horse's back, he would collect a multitude to hear him; but no wise man would say he had made a better sermon for that.</QUOTE> Again, Horace Walpole, in a letter to Lord Strafford, dated <datestruct VALUE="1783-09-12"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=12>12th</day>, <year reg=1783>1783</year></datestruct>, writes:-- <QUOTE>London, at this time of year (September), is as nauseous a drug as any in an apothecary's shop. I could find nothing at all to do, and so went to Astley's, which, indeed, was much beyond my expectation. I did not wonder any longer that Darius was chosen king by the instructions he gave to his horse, nor that Caligula made his horse consul. Astley can make his dance minuets and hornpipes. But I shall not have even Astley now; Her Majesty the Queen of France, who has as much taste as Caligula, has sent for the whole of the <hi rend=italics>dramatis personae</hi> to Paris.</QUOTE> 
   <P>When the London season was over, Astley removed his <hi rend=italics>troupe</hi> to Paris, a practice which he continued regularly for many years with great success. He next brought out a new entertainment, styled in the bills <QUOTE>Egyptian Pyramids; or, La Force d&lsquo;Hercule.</QUOTE> It consisted in the now well-known feat of <num value="4">four</num> men supporting <num value="3">three</num> others on their shoulders, these again supporting <num value="2">two</num> more, the last, in their turn, supporting <num value="1">one</num>. This was long a very favourite and attractive <pb id="P.401" n="401"> spectacle, and Astley erected a large representation of it on the south end of the riding school. He also named his private residence Hercules House, after this <hi rend=italics>tour de force</hi>. The <QUOTE>Hercules</QUOTE> tavern and gardens, of which we have already spoken, were so called after this building; and the street in Lambeth, now called Hercules Buildings, derives its name from the same source. 
    <P>The centre of the riding school being still uncovered caused many inconveniences; and Astley, as early as the year <datestruct value="1772"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, with a keen eye to the future, purchased, at a cheap rate, a quantity of timber that had been used as scaffolding at the funeral of Augusta, Princess Dowager of Wales.  Later on, in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, a further supply of timber was cheaply obtained by a clever <hi rend=italics>ruse</hi> on the part of  Mr. Astley. It had long been the custom at the close of elections for the mob to destroy and make bonfires of the hustings; but Astley, mingling in the crowd, represented that as he would give beer for the timber, if it were carried to his establishment, it would be a more eligible way of disposing of it than by burning. The hint was taken, and with the timber thus obtained Astley covered in and completely remodelled   the riding school, adding a stage, <num value="2">two</num> tiers of boxes, a pit, and a gallery.   But as this was the <num value="1">first</num> attempt to exhibit horsemanship in a covered building, and the bare idea   of doing so was at the time considered preposterously absurd, as a sort of compromise with public opinion, he caused the dome-shaped roof to be painted with representations of branches and leaves of trees, and gave the new edifice the airy appellation of <QUOTE>The Royal  Grove.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Mr. Astley was now enabled to give his entertainments by candle-light; and <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> pieces that he produced, however successful it may have been to the treasury, had a curious-sounding title, from an equestrian point of view; it figured in the bills as <title>A Grand Equestrian Dramatic Spectacle, entitled <QUOTE>The Death of Captain Cook</QUOTE></title>. The sensation caused by the discoveries and death of Captain Cook was then fresh in the minds of the people; and Astley, seizing upon the principal events connected with that tragic affair, placed them on the stage in such a manner that the piece was most successful, and formed a very important step in the ladder by which the quondam sergeantmajor was enabled to rise to fame and fortune. 
   <P>It would appear, however, that Astley soon had a rival in the field; for Pennant writes in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>In this neighbourhood are <num value="2">two</num> theatres of innocent recreation, . . . of a nature unknown to every other part of Europe--the British hippodromes belonging to Messrs. Astley and Hugheswhere the wonderful sagacity of that most useful animal, the horse, is fully evinced. While we admire its admirable docility and apprehension, we cannot less admire the powers of the riders, and the graceful attitudes which the human frame is capable of receiving.</QUOTE> He goes on, in most prosy commonplace, to praise not only equestrian skill, but also the <QUOTE>art of tumbling</QUOTE> practised here, as <QUOTE>showing us how fearfully and wonderfully we are made ;</QUOTE> and very sensibly recommending every Government to indulge its subjects in such scenes as <QUOTE>preservations from   worse employs, and as relaxations from   the cares of life.</QUOTE> We have already spoken of Hughes's Circus, afterwards the Surrey Theatre, in our account of the Blackfriars Road.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="368">368</num>.</NOTE>

    <P>Up to this time Astley had performed annually in Paris during the winter months; and it was partly with the view of giving up these visits to the  French capital that he constructed the <QUOTE>Royal  Grove;</QUOTE> but as the proprietors of the patent theatres raised formidable objections to Astley's winter entertainments and dramatic representations in Lambeth, he was forced to continue his journeys to Paris. The breaking out of the French Revolution, however, put an end to Astley's Parisian performances; so, building a circus in Dublin, he carried on his winter campaigns in Ireland; and in <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct> he gave up the principal cares and management of the business to his son, whose <num value="1">first</num> appearance we have noticed above, and who had by this time become a handsome young man, as agile and graceful as Vestris. 
    <P>In the following year, war having broken out with France, the Duke of York was sent on the Continent in command of the British army; and Astley, who had made himself very useful in superintending the embarkation of the cavalry and artillery horses, went with his royal highness. His old regiment, the Fifteenth, was in the same army; and Astley, knowing by experience the wants of actual service, presented the men with a large supply of needles, thread, buttons, bristles, twine, leather-everything, in short, requisite in mending clothes and shoes. He also purchased a large quantity of flannel, and setting all the females employed at the <QUOTE>Royal Grove</QUOTE> to work, they soon made a warm waistcoat for every man of the regiment; and in a corner of each garment there was sewn what Astley termed <QUOTE>a friend in need:</QUOTE> in other words, a splendid shilling.   This patriotic generosity being duly chronicled in the newspapers <pb id="P.402" n="402"> of the period, did not, as may readily be imagined, lessen the popularity of the <QUOTE>Royal Grove,</QUOTE> or the nightly receipts of cash taken at the doors of that place of entertainment. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct> Astley was suddenly recalled from the Continent by the total destruction of the <QUOTE>Royal Grove</QUOTE> and <num value="19">nineteen</num> adjoining houses by fire. Nothing daunted, he immediately commenced to rebuild it on a more elegant and extended scale, and at the following Easter opened the <LEMMA id="lemma.402.1">new house</LEMMA>, re-naming it the <QUOTE>Amphitheatre of Arts.</QUOTE> At the peace of Amiens, in <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, Astley went to Paris, and finding that the circus he had erected in the Faubourg du Temple had been used as a barrack by the Revolutionary Government, he petitioned 
<FIGURE id="Fig.402" n="2000.14.0147"><HEAD>Entrance To Astley's Theatre In <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 Bonaparte, then <num value="1">First</num> Consul, for compensation; and, greatly to the surprise of every <num value="1">one</num>, the petition was favourably received, and compensation granted. But scarcely had the money been received when hostilities again broke out, and all Englishmen in France were subjected to a long and painful deten. tion as prisoners of war. Astley, however, by a rare combination of cunning and courage, effected his escape to the frontier, disguised as an invalid French officer. But, though favoured by fortune in this bold escape, dismal intelligence awaited his arrival in England. His faithful wife was dead, and his theatre a smoking ruin, having been a <num value="2">second</num> time burned to the ground.   The conflagration on this occasion extended to <num value="40">forty</num> other <pb id="P.403" n="403"> houses, and caused the death of young Mr. Astley's mother-in-law, Mrs. Woodham, and a loss to the proprietor of <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure>.   Nevertheless, the gallant old sergeant-major again set to work to repair the losses he had sustained, and on the following Easter Monday another theatre was opened, this time as the <QUOTE>Royal Amphitheatre.</QUOTE> 
   <P>This amphitheatre is described by Sir Richard Phillips at some length, in his <QUOTE>Modern London,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct>. <QUOTE>Being rebuilt after being lately burnt down,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE>it stands on the very ground on which Mr. Astley, senior, formerly exhibited feats of horsemanship and other amusements in the open air, the success and profits of which enabled him afterwards to extend his plan and to erect a building which, from the rural cast of the internal decorations, he called the  <Q>Royal Grove.</Q>  In this theatric structure stage exhibitions were given, while in a circular area, similar to that in the late theatre, horsemanship and other feats of strength and agility were continued.</QUOTE> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.403" n="2000.14.0148"><HEAD>Interior Of Astley's Amphitheatre In <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
   <P>Astley, when he <num value="1">first</num> started his riding school, had no other music than a common drum, which was beaten by his wife. To this he subsequently added a fife, the players standing on a kind of small platform, placed in the centre of the ring; and it was not till he opened the Royal Grove that he employed a regular orchestra.   Although an excellent rider, and a great favourite of George III., old Astley was an excessively ignorant man. <num value="1">One</num> day, during a rehearsal a performer suddenly ceased playing. <QUOTE>Hallo!</QUOTE> cried Astley, addressing the delinquent; <QUOTE>what's the matter now?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>There's a rest,</QUOTE> answered the other. <QUOTE>A   rest!</QUOTE> Astley repeated, angrily; <QUOTE>I don't pay you to rest, but to play!</QUOTE> Upon another occasion, hearing a manager complain of the conduct of his actors, Astley said to him, <QUOTE>Why don't you treat them as I do <hi rend=italics>mine</hi>?</QUOTE> --alluding, of course, to his horses- <QUOTE>I never give them anything to eat till after their performance is done.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Astley always kept a sharp eye on his <pb id="P.404" n="404"> instrumental performers.   <num value="1">One</num> evening he entered the orchestra in a rage, and asked of the leader why the trumpets did not play. <QUOTE>This is a <hi rend=italics>pizzicato</hi>
passage, sir,</QUOTE> was the reply. <QUOTE>A pizzy-what?</QUOTE> said Astley. <QUOTE>A   <hi rend=italics>pizzicato</hi>, sir.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Well, I can't afford to let them   be idle; so let the trumpets 
<hi rend=italics>pizzicato</hi> too!</QUOTE> Indeed, as an accompaniment to equestrian exercises, Astley always considered that loudness was the most desirable quality in music. And though he ever took care to have an excellent band, with a well-qualified leader, he, nevertheless, considered them   more as an indispensable drain on the treasury than a useful auxiliary to the performance. <QUOTE>Any fool,</QUOTE> he used invariably to say, <QUOTE>can handle a fiddle, but it takes a man to manage a horse; and yet I have to pay a fellow that plays upon <num value="1">one</num> fiddle as much salary as a man that rides upon <num value="3">three</num> horses.</QUOTE> Such opinions, freely expressed, not unfrequently led to angry scenes, of which amusing anecdotes have been related. 
    <P>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, on the <num value="1">first</num> night of a new piece, as the curtain rose to slow and solemn music, Astley, who was in the front observing the effect, overheard a carpenter sawing a board behind the scenes. <QUOTE>Go,</QUOTE> said the manager to Smith, his rough-rider and aide-de-camp in ordinary, <QUOTE>go and tell that stupid fellow not to saw so infernally loud.</QUOTE> Smith, fancying that Astley alluded to the music, went at once to the orchestra, and whispered in the leader's ear, <QUOTE>Mr. Astley has desired me to tell you not to saw so infernally loud.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Saw!</QUOTE> retorted the enraged musician; <QUOTE>go back and tell him this is the very last night I shall saw in his infernal stables!</QUOTE> Of course, when the curtain fell, the musician's wrath was appeased by the mistake being explained. 
   <P>At another time, Astley requested his leader to arrange a few bars of music for a broad-sword combat- <QUOTE>a rang, tang, bang; <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="2">two</num>, <num value="3">three</num>; and a cut sort of thing, you know!</QUOTE> for thus he curtly expressed his ideas of what he required. At the subsequent rehearsal Astley shouted out to his stage-manager, <QUOTE>Stop I stop I This will never do.   It's not half noisy enough; we must get shields!</QUOTE> simply meaning   that the mimic combatants should be supplied with shields to clash against the broad-swords, causing the noise so excitingly provocative of applause from the audience. But the too sensitive leader, thinking it was his music that was <QUOTE>not half noisy enough,</QUOTE> and it was Shields, the composer, to whom Astley alluded, jumped out of the orchestra, and, tearing the score to pieces, indignantly exclaimed, <QUOTE>Get Shields, then, as soon as you please, for I am heartily sick and tired of you!</QUOTE> 
   <P>Although uneducated, old Philip Astley was an enterprising man, with a strong mind and acute understanding; he was remarkable for his eccentric habits and sundry peculiarities of manner; and he is said to have built, at different periods of his life, at his own cost and for his own purpose, no less than <num value="19">nineteen</num> theatres. He was the founder of, or, at all events, <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest performers at the Olympic; and there is extant a print of Astley's trained horses, &amp;c., performing there.   He was particularly skilful in the training of horses.   His method was to give each horse his preparatory lesson alone, and when there was no noise or anything to distract his attention from his instructor. If the horse was interrupted during the lesson, or his attention withdrawn, he was dismissed for that day, and the lesson was repeated on the next. When he was perfect in certain lessons by himself, he was associated with other horses whose education was further advanced; and it was the practice of that great <QUOTE>tamer of horses</QUOTE> to reward the animals with slices of carrot or apple when they performed well. In the same manner M. Franconi treated his horses in Paris. 
   <P>Like Tom   Dogget before him, the gallant old sergeant-major seems to have taken an interest in aquatic matters; at all events, we read in Strutt's <QUOTE>Sports and Pastimes,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>: <QUOTE>Of late years the proprietor of Vauxhall Gardens and Astley, the rider, give each of them in the course of the summer a new wherry, to be rowed for by a certain number of watermen, <num value="2">two</num> in each boat.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Astley lived to see another peace with France and to recover his property in Paris; for he died on the <datestruct VALUE="1814-10-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="73">seventy-third</num> year of his age, at his own residence in the Faubourg du Temple, and was buried in the well-known cemetery of Pere la Chaise.   His son, who was always termed <QUOTE>Young Astley,</QUOTE> died in <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>, in the same bed, in the same house, and was buried in the same grave as his father. 
   <P>After the decease of young Astley the theatre was carried on by Mr. W. Davis, and appears to have been called for a time <QUOTE>Davis's Amphitheatre</QUOTE> on the play-bills, though with the people at large it never ceased to be <QUOTE>Astley's.</QUOTE> A melodrama, founded on the battle of Waterloo, was then among its chief attractions. Bonaparte was brought upon the stage face to face with Wellington, and made to utter very generous sentiments, and to do all sorts of generous things, which were loudly applauded by the galleries. But the public could not bear to have the old associations of the place disturbed even upon its play-bills, and the ancient name prevailed. <pb id="P.405" n="405">

But feats of strength and agility always shared the popular favour with horsemanship at Astley's; and among the most renowned performers in old Philip's days was Belzoni, who afterwards quitted the circus for the tombs of the Pharaohs and the Pyramids, and has left a foremost renown as an Egyptian explorer, as we have shown in our account of the British Museum.<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="531">531</num>.</NOTE>   There was another strong man, the <QUOTE>Flemish Hercules,</QUOTE> whose real name was Petre Ducrow; he was the father of Andrew, destined in after years to become the proprietor of the theatre, and the most daring and graceful performing horseman the world has ever seen. 
    <P>On the secession of Mr. Davis, the theatre was taken jointly by Messrs.

    <P>Ducrow had been <num value="1">one</num> of Astley's most famous riders.   Mr. Disraeli, in a speech delivered at High  Wycombe in <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>, compared the then Reform  Ministry of Lord Melbourne to this great horseman.  He said, addressing his audience, <QUOTE>I dare say, now, some of you have heard of M. Ducrow, that celebrated gentleman who rides on <num value="6">six</num> horses.   What a prodigious achievement! It seems impossible; but you have confidence in Ducrow.   You fly to witness it; unfortunately, <num value="1">one</num> of the horses is ill, and a donkey is substituted in its place.   But Ducrow is still admirable: there he is bounding along in spangled jacket and cork slippers I The whole town is mad to see Ducrow riding at the same time on <num value="6">six</num> horses; but now <num value="2">two</num> more of the steeds are seized with the staggers, and lo! <num value="3">three</num> jackasses in their stead! Still Ducrow persists, and still announces to the public that he will ride round his circus every night on his <num value="6">six</num> steeds. At last, all the horses are knocked up, and now there are half-a-dozen donkeys. What a change! Behold the hero in the amphitheatre, the spangled jacket thrown on <num value="1">one</num> side, the cork slippers on the other.   Puffing, panting, and perspiring, he pokes <num value="1">one</num> sullen brute, thwacks another, cuffs a <num value="3">third</num>, and curses a <num value="4">fourth</num>, while <num value="1">one</num> brays to the audience, and another rolls in the sawdust.   Behold the late Prime Minister and the Reform   Ministry! The spirited and snow-white   steeds have gradually changed into an equal number of sullen and obstinate donkeys; while Mr. Merryman, who, like the Lord Chancellor, was once the very life of the ring, now lies his despairing length in the middle of the stage, with his jokes exhausted, and his bottle empty.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Grimaldi, whose father lived close by Astley's, in Stangate, was often engaged here as a clown.  On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, Ducrow, while teaching a boy to go through a difficult act of horsemanship, applied the whip to him, and observed to Grimaldi, who was standing by, that it was necessary to make an impression on the boy. <QUOTE>Yes,</QUOTE> said Joe; <QUOTE>but you need not make the whacks (wax) so hard.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The amphitheatre, as it stood in Ducrow's time, is thus described in Allen's <QUOTE>History of Surrey,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>The front of the theatre, which is plain and of brick, stuccoed, stands laterally with the houses in Bridge Road, the access to the back part of the premises being in Stangate Street.  There is a plain wooden portico, the depth of which corresponds with the width of the pavement.  In front of this portico is the royal arms. Within the pediment in front of the building is  <Q>Astley's</Q>  in raised letters, and in the front of the portico, in a similar style,  <Q>Royal Amphitheatre.</Q>  Beneath this portico are the entrances to the boxes and pit; the gallery entrance is lower down the road, and separated from the front of the theatre by several houses.   The boxes are approached by a plain staircase, at the head of which is a handsome lobby.   The form of the auditory is elliptical, and is lighted by a very large cut-glass lustre and chandeliers with bell-lamps; gas is the medium of <pb id="P.406" n="406"> illumination used all over the premises. There is <num value="1">one</num> continued row or tier of boxes round the auditory, above the central part of which is the gallery; and there is a half tier of upper boxes on each side, with slips over them. The floor of the ride within the auditory is earth and sawdust, where a ring or circle, <num value="44">forty-four</num> feet in diameter, is bounded by a boarded enclosure about <num value="4">four</num> feet in height, the curve of which next the stage forms the outline of the orchestra, and the remainder that of the pit, behind which is an extensive lobby and a box for refreshments.   The proscenium is large and movable--for the convenience of widening and heightening the stage, which is, perhaps, the largest and most convenient in London-and is terminated by immense platforms, or floors, rising above each other, and extending the whole width of the stage. These are exceedingly massive and strong. The horsemen gallop and skirmish over them, and they will admit a carriage, equal in size and weight to a mail coach, to be driven across them. They are, notwithstanding, so constructed as to be placed and removed in a short space of time by manual labour and mechanism.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Our readers will not forget that <QUOTE>Astley's,</QUOTE> as it was some half a century ago, forms <num value="1">one</num> of the <QUOTE>Sketches by Boz,</QUOTE> which made the fame, though not the name, of Charles Dickens as a young man known to the world. <QUOTE>It was not a  <Q>Royal Amphitheatre</Q>  in those days,</QUOTE> he wrote, <QUOTE>nor had Ducrow arisen to shed the light of classic taste and portable gas over the sawdust of the circus; but the whole character of the place was the same: the pieces were the same, the clown's jokes were the same, the riding-masters were equally grand, the comic performers equally witty, the tragedians equally hoarse, and the <Q>high-trained chargers</Q> equally spirited. Astley's has altered for the better-we have changed for the worse.</QUOTE> And then he proceeds to give a sketch of the interior during a performance in the Easter or Midsummer holidays, and the happy faces of <QUOTE>the children,</QUOTE> whom <QUOTE>pa</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>ma</QUOTE> have taken to witness the scene, including <QUOTE>Miss Woolford</QUOTE> and the other 
<foreign lang=fr>equestriennes</foreign>. 
   <P>Thackeray, too, mentions this place in <QUOTE>The Newcomes.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Who was it,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE>that took the children to Astley's but Uncle Newcome? I saw him there in the midst of a cluster of these little people, all children together. He laughed, delighted at Mr. Merriman's jokes in the ring. He beheld the <hi rend=italics>Battle of Waterloo</hi> with breathless interest, and was amazed-yes, amazed, by Jove, sir!-at the prodigious likeness of the principal actor to the Emperor Napoleon. . . . The little girls, Sir Brian's daughters, holding each by a finger of his hands, and younger Masters Alfred and Edward clapping and hurraing by his side; while Mr. Clive and Miss Ethel sat in the back of the box enjoying the scene. . . . It did <num value="1">one</num> good to hear the colonel's honest laugh at the clown's jokes, and to see the tenderness and simplicity with which he watched over this happy brood of young ones.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The <num value="3">third</num> theatre on this spot was burnt down in <datestruct VALUE="1841-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, when under the management of Ducrow, who died insane shortly after the fire, on account of the losses he sustained.   He was buried, as we have already seen, at Kensal Green Cemetery,<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="220">220</num>.</NOTE> where a handsome monument is erected to his memory. 
    <P>In October of the same year, the vacant site was taken on a long lease by Mr. William Batty, who, in the following year, erected at his own expense the present amphitheatre, which is much larger and more substantially built than any of its predecessors. 
   <P>Very naturally, as we have observed at the commencement of this chapter, the transpontine theatres have always been the chief homes of the sensational drama and of eccentric exhibitions: and this is as true of Astley's as of the rest. Here, for instance, in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, were exhibited Mynheer Wybrand Lolkes, the dwarf watchmaker of Holland, and his wife, who was just <num value="3">three</num> times his height; but as time has worn on <QUOTE>sensationalism</QUOTE> seems to have been triumphant.   At all events, in the autumn of <datestruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct>, Miss Ada Menkens here played 
<hi rend=italics>Mazeppa</hi> to crowded houses; while other theatres, although possessing very good   actors, were all but deserted. In <datestruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct> the theatre was taken by Mr. Sanger, who had for a short time previously occupied the Agricultural Hall at Islington for equestrian performances. Under this gentleman's rule the title of <QUOTE>Astley's</QUOTE> has disappeared from the bills as the name of the establishment, and in its place we have <QUOTE>Sanger's Grand National Amphitheatre.</QUOTE> But Astley's is Astley's still with the people, and the old associations of the place still remain, at all events in part, for elephants, camels, dromedaries, as well as horses, are still made to appear upon the stage in order to heighten the spectacular effect. Although the present theatre was constructed with both stage and circle for horsemanship, the latter has been discontinued since <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct>, when the theatre was remodelled by Mr. Dion Boucicault. 
   <P>M. Esquiros observes pertinently, with reference to Astley's: <QUOTE>If asked what relation such a theatre <pb id="P.407" n="407"> can have to the poetic drama, I reply, that it is the peculiar privilege of the great works of the human mind that they adapt themselves to circumstances. Mr. Cooke, <num value="1">one</num> of the latest managers of Astley's Amphitheatre, had the idea of applying the resources and pomps peculiar to this theatre to Shakespeare's historical plays.   He accordingly brought out here <hi rend=italics>Richard III</hi>., and, for the <num value="1">first</num> time, the hump-backed Richard was seen on the stage, surrounded by his staff on horseback, and himself mounted on that famous steed,  <Q>White Surrey,</Q>  whose name Shakespeare has immortalised. The noble animal marched bravely through the battle, and died with an air of truth that quite affected the spectators. Encouraged by this success, Astley's company next appeared in <hi rend=italics>Henry IV</hi>. and 
<hi rend=italics>Macbeth</hi>.   I will not assert that Shakespeare's plays thus converted into equestrian pieces satisfled all artistic conditions; but when I look at the moral effect, I cannot but applaud the experiment. Astley's is the theatre   of the people; here the East-end</QUOTE> [Transpontine?] <QUOTE>workmen, costermongers, and orange-women, come to seek a few hours of recreation after the fatigues and struggles of a rough day's toil.   Shakespeare's plays-decorated rather than well performed, and hidden by processions and   cavalcades, which, perhaps, denaturalised their character, but which, after all, were adapted to the instincts of a class of the population which lives specially on what strikes its eyes-at any rate allowed some portion of the poetical horizon to be brought within their view. In any case, and to say the least, they happily occupied the place of those dangerous performances which arouse in man nothing beyond the feeling of savage strength.</QUOTE>

<P>By an order of council, made in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, the parish of Lambeth was divided into <num value="5">five</num> districts-called respectively St. Mary's, or the old church district; Waterloo, or St. John's district; Kennington, or St. Mark's; Brixton, or St. Matthew's; and Norwood, or St. Luke's. Of the <num value="3">three</num> last-named districts we have already treated in the course of our perambulations. Of St. John's district we will now proceed to speak. 
   <P>The formation of Waterloo Bridge--which was completed and opened on the <datestruct VALUE="1817-06-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>-as may be expected, soon made a great alteration in the appearance of Southern London, especially in those parts lying between Blackfriars and Westminster Bridge Roads.   Towards the close of the last century, water-works for Lambeth were established in the Belvidere Road, on part of Belvidere Wharf, and what was formerly a garden on the Narrow   Wall.   A   company-called the Lambeth Water-works Company--was established for supplying the parish of Lambeth and parts adjacent with water taken from the Thames. They commenced their operations with a small capital, but by careful management, and avoiding a large expenditure at the commencement, their enterprise was attended with success. 
    <P>Previous to the formation of the above-mentioned company, the portion of the metropolis lying south of the river Thames was <num value="1">first</num> supplied with water by <num value="2">two</num> wheels erected at London Bridge, near the Surrey shore, and also by separate works at St. Mary Overies.   These <num value="2">two</num> establishments, both of considerable antiquity, were combined, under the name of the Southwark Water-works, in <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, a <num value="3">third</num> company, the Vauxhall Water-works Company, was established for supplying the Surrey side of London. They took their water at <num value="1">first</num> from the river Effra, and subsequently from the Thames, near Vauxhall Bridge. 
   <P>All the above-mentioned companies, in the <num value="1">first</num> instance, supplied water just as it came to hand, without being over-particular as to its condition. Between the years <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg=1820>1820</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg=1830>1830</year></datestruct>, however, the attention of the public was attracted to the quality of the water they were then receiving, and since it appeared that improvement was needed, the companies, urged by the pressure from without, took steps to improve it accordingly. The Lambeth <pb id="P.408" n="408"> Water-works Company, shortly after <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, formed elevated reservoirs at Brixton Hill and Streatham, for the purpose of the service generally, and maintaining a constant supply of water in case of fire. Of late years, however, they have made a great improvement in the old condition of things; for, considering the state of the river in the tide-way objectionable as a source of supply (owing principally to the constant agitation now kept up by the steamboats plying between the bridges, and the increased quantity of sewage poured into the Thames in the London district), they obtained, in <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct>, an Act to enable them   to abandon their former source near the Belvidere Road, and to take water from the pure stream of the river at Ditton, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.408" n="2000.14.0149"><HEAD>The House   In Waterloo Bridge Road.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <num value="23">twenty-three</num> miles above London Bridge, and far beyond the reach of the tide. 
   <P>About the same time that the water-works were established here, a large shot factory was built close by, together with a fine wet-dock for the loading and warehousing of goods.   Near Waterloo Bridge, and close to the site of Cuper's Gardens, of which we have already spoken,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="383">383</num>.</NOTE> another shot manufactory was erected about the year <datestruct value="1789"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct> by Messrs. Watts. The height of the tower of this manufactory is <num value="140">140</num> feet, and the shot falls upwards of <num value="120">120</num> feet. These shot towers are conspicuous objects on the southern side of the Thames near Waterloo Bridge. <pb id="P.409" n="409"> 
   <P>The Belvidere Road, or Narrow Wall, is an ancient way, as it is depicted in views of London dated <datestruct value="1588--"><year reg="1588">1588</year></datestruct>; as are Vine Street and the Cornwall Road; but no houses seem to have been in either of them, with the exception of a few in and about Vine Street. From the Belvidere Road, in the present day, an excellent opportunity is afforded of noticing the extent of the artificial elevation given to the road when the approaches to Waterloo Bridge were made. Indeed, it hardly needs the occasional incursions of the river to remind the water-side inhabitants that this now dense and widely-spreading region was once a marsh, and even a flat swampy level, scarcely raised above the surface of the Thames. 
   <P><num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> institutions which attracts our attention as we pass down the Waterloo Road is the Royal Infirmary for Children and Women, which has stood here for upwards of half a century. It was originally established at St. Andrew's Hill, in the City, in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, but was removed to Lambeth in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>. The Duke of Kent assisted in founding the infirmary, and the Queen has long been an annual subscriber; and the Prince of Wales, on whose estate as Duke of Cornwall the hospital          <num value="275">275</num> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.409" n="2000.14.0150"><HEAD>View In The New Cut.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 stands, has allowed the committee to purchase the freehold on advantageous terms.   In <datestruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct> the building was enlarged and considerably improved. The institution, which is supported by donations and subscriptions, at <num value="1">first</num> received children only, to whom it afforded relief for diseases of all kinds, from the time of birth till <datestruct value="14"><year reg="14">fourteen</year></datestruct> years of age, being open, in cases of emergency, to all <num value="1">first</num> applications for admission without any recommendation. There were in <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct> <num value="50">fifty</num> beds and cots in the hospital, and an asphalte playground on the roof for convalescent patients.   During the preceding year <datestruct value="232"><year reg="232">232</year></datestruct> in-patients (children) were received, and <num value="6550">6,550</num> out-patients (women and children) visited. There were, during the same period, <num value="1430">1,430</num> visits paid by the resident medical officer to sick children at home. In <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct> the Princess Louise (Marchioness of Lorne) formally re-opened the infirmary on the completion of the enlargement mentioned above, when <num value="1">one</num> of the wards-hitherto known as the <QUOTE>Hamilton Ward,</QUOTE> from having been founded at the expense of Mr. Francis Hamilton, <num value="1">one</num> of the vice-presidents--was, at the request of that gentleman, re-named the <QUOTE>Louise Ward.</QUOTE> There are now <num value="6">six</num> wards in all. The patients all pay <pb id="P.410" n="410"> something towards their treatment.     The out-patients pay <measure value="1d." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>d.</measure> for each visit, and the parents of the in-patients give <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> a week. In some cases these sums are provided by friends connected with the hospital.   This hospital, we need scarcely add, is situated in the midst of <num value="1">one</num> of the poorest districts of London, and provides comfortable beds, good food, kind nursing, and medicine for sick children and women, who cannot get these things at home, and that, therefore, it is an institution deserving of the heartiest support. 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.410.1">New Church</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>Another invaluable institution in this neighbourhood--a sister hospital to the Magdalen--is the General Lying--in Hospital in York Road.   It was instituted in <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, mainly through the exertions of Dr. John Leake, an eminent writer on the diseases of women, and was incorporated in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>.   The hospital was formerly in the Westminster Bridge Road, near Marsh Gate, from which, in <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, it was removed to its present situation, where a neat square building of white brick, ornamented with stone, with a handsome receding portico of the Ionic order, has been erected. The hospital was principally intended as an asylum <QUOTE>for the wives of poor industrious tradesmen and distressed housekeepers, who, either from unavoidable misfortunes, or from the burden of large families, are reduced to want, and rendered incapable of bearing the expenses incident to the lying--in state, and also for the wives of indigent soldiers and seamen; but the governors, in the spirit of true philanthropy, have extended the benefits of the institution to unmarried females, restricting this indulgence, however, to the <num value="1">first</num> instance of misconduct.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Pennant enumerates the Lying--in Hospital, the Asylum, or House of Refuge, and the Magdalen, as admirable institutions within a short distance of each other, and together helping to relieve the sufferings of the weaker sex. 
    <P>Lower down the Waterloo Road, on the east side, and nearly facing the terminus of the South- Western Railway, stands <LEMMA id="lemma.410.2">St. John's Church</LEMMA>, which was built in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>--<num value="4">4</num>.   The site of this church having been a swamp and horse-pond, an artificial foundation of piles had to be formed before any portion of the superstructure   could be raised. The edifice, which is anything but ecclesiastical in character, is built of brick, with stone dressings; the plan of the basement comprehends not only the church, but a terrace in front of it--the former is a parallelogram, the latter forms a transept at the west end, the whole of the area being laid out in catacombs.   The terrace was rendered necessary to fill up the space between the church and the road, which is considerably raised to meet the level of Waterloo Bridge.   The western front of the building is occupied with a Grecian portico of the Doric order, sustaining an entablature, cornice, and pediment, the frieze being ornamented with chaplets of myrtle. The steeple is situated above the centre of the front: it consists of a tower and spire, both of which are square in their plan; the storey above the clock-dial is of the Ionic order. The obelisk on the summit is crowned by a stone ball and cross. The interior of the church is not divided into nave and aisles, according to the usual plan; the piers between the windows are ornamented with pilasters, and the ceiling is horizontal and panelled. 
   <P>The sides and west end of the church is occupied by a gallery, sustained on Doric columns. The organ was the gift of Mr. Lett, an inhabitant of the district, who was also the donor of the site of the church.   In the centre aisle is a font of white marble, brought from Italy, and presented to the church by the Rev. Dr. Barrett, the <num value="1">first</num> incumbent. The east end is ornamented with a handsome stained-glass window, and the reredos is richly gilt and painted in arabesque. 
    <P>St. John's Church   contains <num value="1">one</num> memorable tomb, that of Elliston, the comedian, whose name is so intimately connected, as we have seen, with transpontine performances. Those who have read Charles Lamb's reminiscences of Elliston, in his <QUOTE>Ellistoniana,</QUOTE> and his address <QUOTE>to the shade of Elliston,</QUOTE> will not need to be reminded how great an actor he was, though in the main a comedian. He was well educated, and never forgot the knowledge of Latin that he acquired during his youth. <QUOTE>Great wert thou,</QUOTE> writes Charles Lamb, <QUOTE>in thy life, Robert William Elliston, and not lessened in thy death, if report speaks truly, which says thou didst direct that thy mortal remains should repose under no inscription but <num value="1">one</num> of pure Latinity.</QUOTE> He was born in Bloomsbury in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, and was educated at St. Paul's School, being originally intended for the University.   In his boyhood, however, he was brought into contact with the late Mr. Charles Mathews, and both being smitten with a love of the drama, made their <num value="1">first</num> effort on private boards, on the <num value="1">first</num> floor of a pastry-cook's shop in Bedford Street, Covent Garden, along with a daughter of Flaxman, the sculptor.   Having played in public at Bath, York, and other towns in the provinces, Elliston made his <num value="1">first</num> appearance in London at the Haymarket in <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>.   He was a most joyous and light-hearted man, excellent alike in tragedy and comedy, and unrivalled in farce; and he enjoyed a long lease of popular favour. We have already mentioned his connection with the Olympic <pb id="P.411" n="411"> and the Surrey Theatres.<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="35">35</num>; and <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="370">370</num>.</NOTE>       In his capacity as manager he would often favour the audience with a rich specimen of the grandiloquent style-a style immortalised by Charles Lamb in <num value="1">one</num> of his delightful Essays.   He died in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>The churchyard contains some fine plane-trees; and steps were, in <datestruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct>, being taken to lay it out as a garden, and make it available for the purposes of recreation. 
   <P>Nearly opposite St. John's Church is the London terminus of the South-Western Railway, together with the Waterloo Junction station of the South- Eastern Railway.   The South-Western terminus in itself is spacious, but makes no pretence to architectural effect. <LEMMA id="lemma.411.1">The South-Western Railway was originally called the London and Southampton Railway, and had its terminus for several years at <num value="9">Nine</num> Elms</LEMMA>, Vauxhall. About <num value="30">thirty</num> miles were open- for traffic in <datestruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>, the line being extended in the following year to Basingstoke, and in <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct> to Southampton.   The extension from Vauxhall to the Waterloo Road was effected in <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct>, and although only a trifle over <num value="2">two</num> miles in length, cost <measure value="800000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="800000">800,000</num></measure>.   From Waterloo Road to <num value="9">Nine</num> Elms the line is carried through what is-or, at all events, was at <num value="1">one</num> time-<num value="1">one</num> of the dirtiest parts of London, upon a series of brick arches, which were considered marvels of construction when they were built. From   the Waterloo Road, the approaches to the booking-offices are by inclined roads.   Of the station itself little or nothing need be said, further than that it has been so much enlarged and altered at different times since its <num value="1">first</num> erection, that it now covers a very large space of ground. It is connected with the South-Eastern Railway by a bridge for trains and passengers. From this station trains run at frequent intervals to Richmond, Hampton Court, Windsor, &amp;c.; also to Winchester, Portsmouth, Southampton, Weymouth, Salisbury, Exeter, Plymouth, and other large towns in the south-west and west of England. <QUOTE>The advantages of this metropolitan station,</QUOTE> writes Bradshaw, in his <QUOTE>London Guide,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>have been very great, both to mere pleasure-seekers and men of business; and when about to undertake a journey on this most tempting and trustworthy of all the railways, it is felt to be something akin to magic to be wafted from the very heart of London to the verge of Southampton Water in less time than <num value="1">one</num> could walk from here to Hampstead; or enabled to enjoy the enchanting scenery of Richmond and Hampton Court for an expenditure of the same sum that would be absorbed in the most moderate indulgence at a gloomy tavern in town.</QUOTE> A few minutes' ride on this railway will show the traveller as much as he will care to see of this crowded and rather squalid neighbourhood, and speedily carry him into the fields, out of the smoke of London. 
   <P>The New Cut, which runs from the Waterloo to the Blackfriars Road, at a short distance southward of the railway terminus, is chiefly remarkable for the number of its brokers' shops, which line both sides of the way. The thoroughfare, on Sunday mornings, has somewhat the character of its rival near Aldgate, formerly called Petticoat Lane ;<NOTE>See Vol. II., p. <num value="164">164</num>.</NOTE>   and it has furnished plenty of materials to Henry Mayhew for his sketches of <QUOTE>London Labour and the London Poor.</QUOTE> The following sketch of the New Cut on a Sunday morning is taken from a pamphlet, entitled <QUOTE>Sabbath Life in London,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>. The writer, a Scotchman, after narrating what met his gaze in his rambles through Petticoat Lane, Leather Lane, and <num value="7">Seven</num> Dials, proceeds : <QUOTE>Crossing <num value="1">one</num> of the bridges, the same disregard of the day of rest is exhibited on the Surrey side of the Thames; and from London Bridge to Vauxhall Bridge, a distance of <num value="3">three</num> miles, there is an almost continuous line of streets in which business is conducted as on other days. In this respect the New Cut takes a prominent part. and the thoroughfare is thronged with women having their aprons full of provisions.   The manner in which these untidy dames patronise the ginger-beer stalls indicates pretty plainly the dealings they had with the publican on the previous evening; and if that is not enough, a glance at the many bruised and blackened faces will show, certainly not the joys, but the buffetings of matrimonial life. Were such characters to show their figures in any town in Scotland on a  <Q>Sabbath</Q>  morning, loaded with articles for the dinner-table, they would cause as much consternation as if a legion of Satanic forces were let loose, and the people, in their deep-rooted regard for the day, would compel these wanton Sunday desecrators to beat a speedy retreat from public indignation. There is something noble in accounts given of the women in America besieging the public-houses, emptying the destroying liquors into the sewers, and turning the barrel-bellied landlords into the streets. Should ever a civil war befall this country, may it be a rising of Good Templar Amazons against brewers, distillers, and   their satellites the publicans. Would that the American spirit could be infused into the mass of London wives and mothers, not by an exhibition of their <pb id="P.412" n="412"> physical determination, but by a display of their moral power and example, by absenting themselves altogether from the dram-shop, leaving the publican to find a better and more certain field of investment. On my way to Lambeth I passed the door of the Bower Theatre, and my attention was attracted by the play-bill, which announced these pieces:-- <Q> Innocent or Guilty,</Q>   <Q>Charley Wagg, or the Mysteries of London,</Q>  and the  <Q>Hand of Death.</Q>    This theatre is nightly crowded with boys, the children of the Sunday-trading women I have alluded to.   There can be no doubt that such <Q>penny gaffs</Q> have a tendency to vitiate the minds of the rising generation, as has also much of the cheap literature which is issued from the press. There are parties in the literary and dramatic world who live upon vice and corruption; and many of the penny publications, ostensibly got up for boys, and profusely illustrated, are little better than guides to the prison and the penitentiary. Whilst musing on the base purposes to which the drama is too often devoted in this money-grasping age, I was surprised to notice, in large letters, the title of a piece now being performed at the Adelphi,  <Q>The Prayer in the Storm, or the Thirst for Gold.</Q>  Just as well might the publican designate his premises  <Q>The House of Prayer,</Q>   <Q>The Gate of Heaven,</Q>  or <Q> The Celestial Abode.</Q>  The legitimate drama has many beauties, and serves many useful purposes ; but when it goes beyond the teachings of morality, and encroaches on the domains of religion, it deserves to be treated with reprobation and contempt.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The Sunday trading in the <QUOTE>Cut</QUOTE> is continued westward through Lambeth Lower Marsh towards the Westminster Bridge Road, so that the whole distance from the last-named road to Surrey Chapel presents what Dr. Johnson would have called <QUOTE>an animated appearance.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The regular <foreign lang=fr>habitues</foreign> of the place may be divided into <num value="2">two</num> classes--the various dealers and vendors, mostly of <QUOTE>perishable articles,</QUOTE> with their regular customers, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand; and on the other the dealers in miscellaneous goods, and the hundreds of men and boys of the working, and what some people call the <QUOTE>dangerous</QUOTE> classes--irregular customers-among whom   may be seen the real British <QUOTE>navvy,</QUOTE> as good a specimen of humanity after his kind as <num value="1">one</num> need wish to look upon, whose Sunday morning costume differs only from his week-day in having his boots unlaced. To such as these the New Cut is a Sunday morning rendezvous and promenade, and they amuse themselves by sauntering up and down the half-mile of roadway, pipe in mouth, and listening to the oratorical displays of the vendors of every imaginable kind of wares, useful and ornamental, on either side of the road. 
   <P>A writer in the <hi rend=italics>Daily News</hi>, in <datestruct VALUE="1872-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1872">1872</year></datestruct>, gives us the following sketch of a Sunday morning in the New Cut:-- <QUOTE>On entering the Lower Marsh from the Westminster Road, on the righthand side are the Lambeth Baths, in which a temperance meeting is held every Sunday morning. A platform   at <num value="1">one</num> end holds the speakers and singers, for, to enliven the proceedings, between each speech some <num value="1">one</num> sings a song to a lively tune, accompanied by a piano, and the audience---part of which is seated in the spacious bath, from which the water has been drawn off-join in the chorus. There is a continual flow of in-comers and out-goers, and it may be hoped that the zealous preachers of temperance now and then really capture and reform some wretched drunkard, who perhaps  <Q>came in to scof,</Q>  but remained to listen to and profit by the retailed experiences of the speakers, many of whom are by no means ashamed to compare their present good health and comparatively full pockets to their former broken-down state and poverty, which was the result of drink. The shops in the Cut may be stated in round numbers to be about <num value="220">220</num>, of which about <num value="1">one</num>-half were open for business, the other half closed, on Sunday morning; while the stalls and barrows of the costermongers proper, that is, dealers in <Q>perishable articles</Q> (and perhaps including the vendors of the poor man's luxuries--nuts and oranges--which keep to the line of the gutters), might be reckoned at about <num value="120">120</num>; while those of the vendors of non-perishable articles and the itinerant sellers of all kinds of commodities might be stated at a somewhat less figure. Among the latter class may be found the familiar figure of the old razor-paste man; he is to be met with in almost every part of the metropolis during the week, but he is part of the Cut on Sunday. Then there is the seller of knives at half-price; of slippers, braces, boots and shoes, and all kinds of wearing apparel, after <hi rend=italics>its</hi> kind.   In front of a chemist's shop a hearty-looking man is retailing sarsaparilla from a huge bottle, which he holds under the stump of his left arm (in fact, all that is left), at id. per glass. It will  <Q>cure more disorders than Holloway's pills and ointment, chase away headaches and nervous debility, purify the blood, and bring flesh on the bones.</Q>  From   the numbers who in the course of a few minutes paid for their draught and drank it like men, we can quite believe the statement made by the vendor that lie sold more than a <num value="1000">thousand</num> glasses every Sunday morning   . ... Sufferers from  <Q> the ills the flesh is heir to</Q>  are well <pb id="p.413" n="413"> cared for in the New Cut.   A penny stick of some green substance, like sealing-wax, will make many scores of plasters on brown paper, warranted to cure warts, bunions, and corns.   <num value="3">Three</num> plasters applied for <num value="3">three</num> successive days will eradicate the worst of corns, but the pain will vanish in <num value="5">five</num> minutes after the <num value="1">first</num> application. Blisters, already spread, can be bought by the yard; and those suffering from toothache can have the offending ivory extracted then and there.   The dental professor wears a velvet cap, ornamented with about a <num value="100">hundred</num> long-fanged double-teeth, set in rows, and stands behind a tray, on which are displayed some half-dozen villanous-looking   instruments of extraction, <num value="1">one</num> of which, eminently terrible, seemed a cross between a pair of lumpsugar nippers and a pair of tongs. In front were penny bottles of tincture, warranted to cure earache, rheumatism, chilblains, and   all kinds of  <Q>rualgias.</Q>  The volubility of this professor was extraordinary in his endeavours to dispose of his tinctures, but he was far surpassed by the torrents of eloquence which rushed continuously from the  <Q>doctor</Q>  a little higher up, who sold a large box of pills and a half-pint bottle of sarsaparilla for the modest sum of threepence.   The  <Q> doctor </Q> --really a clever fellow-did an enormous trade, amply compensating him for his unsparing expenditure of eloquence and breath. The result of his medicine on the scores who purchased it will be much better felt than described; but it is certain that his patients have unlimited faith in him   and   his therapeutics, which he illustrated occasionally with a human skull, alleged to be that of an illustrious murderer, cut into sections, and parts of which seemed to work on hinges.</QUOTE> The writer then proceeds to describe the bird-dealers, and the sellers of groundsel and chickweed; the dogfanciers, with their true <QUOTE>doormats</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>mopheads</QUOTE> under their arms; the purveyors of cheap pictures, ornaments, and toys, &amp;c.; the piled heaps of dirty women's clothing, upper and under, which female auctioneers are selling by a process known as a <QUOTE>Dutch auction.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Sunday morning,</QUOTE> continues the writer, <QUOTE>is the weekly harvest time of many of the local shops, notably that of a baker, who displays on a slab outside most tempting jam tarts and puffs, purchased eagerly by juveniles who are the fortunate possessors of a halfpenny. A hot plum   composition, a kind of compromise between cake and pudding, sold in large blocks,  <Q>meets with a ready demand at fair prices,</Q>  and at its current value must be  <Q> very filling.</Q>  <num value="2">Two</num> rival vendors of this compost at opposite sides of the street created much amusement by chaffing <num value="1">one</num> another across the highway, and assuring intending purchasers that  <Q> this is the right shop; </Q>  however, the owner of a most stentorian voice, for which natural gift he ought to be thankful, gets the most custom, according to the rule which seems to obtain in this transpontine market, that the most demonstrative and vociferous merchants do the best trade.   There is much good humour, a little rough horse-play, and some bad language in this unwashed crowd of buyers, sellers, and idlers; more of the former and less of the latter than might be expected, which may possibly be attributed to the fact that the public-houses do not open till <num value="1">one</num> o'clock. A few minutes before that hour the police nod the word, and with almost the quickness of a transformation scene at the theatre, the costermongers and their barrows, the itinerant traders and their wares, disappear down the many side streets, and this mercantile Pandemonium   is then hushed.   Idlers gradually disperse, and hot dinners --baked meat and potatoes, the usual wasteful dish of the English poor-issue from various bakers' and other shops, reminding even those who unhappily will not profit by it that this is the poor man's dinner hour. By half-past <num value="1">one</num> the Cut has resumed its ordinary aspect, and has become as dull and quiet, and perhaps as  <Q> respectable,</Q>  as Bedford or Tavistock Squares.</QUOTE> 
    <P>At the corner of the New   Cut and Waterloo  Road stands the Victoria Palace Theatre, which we have described in the preceding chapter. <num value="1">One</num> of the few subscribers that came forward to back the scheme for building the Victoria (or, as it was at <num value="1">first</num> called, the Coburg) Theatre, was <num value="1">one</num> Serres, a marine painter, whose name became known to the world through a little piece of Court scandal.   He made interest with Prince Leopold of Saxe Coburg, and the Princess Charlotte, in order to procure a licence for its establishment. <QUOTE>Dominic Serres and his <num value="2">two</num> daughters,</QUOTE> observes a writer in a newspaper, in <datestruct VALUE="1837-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1837">1837</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>lived in a <num value="1">first</num> floor, next to the fire-engine station, opposite to the stage-door of the Victoria Theatre.   <num value="1">One</num> died there: she was a short, dumpy woman; the younger was horribly deaf.   Their niece, Johanna, daughter of J. T.  Serres, and Olivia, Duchess of Lancaster, married, and has children living at the <num value="2">second</num> or <num value="3">third</num> house in Gibson Street. The surviving aunt has since gone to live with her.</QUOTE> The attempt of the  Serres family to obtain recognition of the title of  Duchess of Lancaster was brought before a court of law, and finally exposed in <datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>, as our readers will remember.<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="567">567</num>.</NOTE>

   <P>On the west side of the Waterloo Road, facing the Victoria Theatre, is St. Thomas's National and Infant Schools, where upwards of <num value="300">300</num> of the rising generation are educated.   A special service for policemen has been held here, on stated days, for some time. This building was for some years used as a temporary church before the erection of St Thomas's Church, in the Westminster Road, nearly facing St. George's Cathedral. St. Thomas's Church was built from the design of Mr. S. S. Teulon, and, as originally designed, exhibited a modification of the fine Dominican church at Ghent; but the estimates having been cut down, it has now merely the appearance of a long and broad parallelogram, with side aisles of <num value="2">two</num> bays towards the east, for galleries,

   <P>In the map of Ralph Aggas, published in the <num value="2">second</num> year of Elizabeth's reign, Lambeth Marsh is open country, and a little dog running at full pace up and down its open space seems to be its only inhabitant, and <QUOTE>monarch of all he surveys.</QUOTE> Even in the <QUOTE>new plan</QUOTE> engraved for Northouck's

Parsons, the actor, lived at a small cottage in the Vauxhall Road, which he called Frog Hall, in allusion to the <QUOTE>Marsh,</QUOTE> near which it stood. 
   <P>In Queen Elizabeth's time this marsh does not seem to have been a desirable place to live in, for it is coupled by Ben Jonson with <QUOTE>Whitefriars</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>Pickt Hatch,</QUOTE> as a residence of dissolute characters. In Hone's <QUOTE>Year-Book</QUOTE> we read that <QUOTE>in Lambeth Marsh Mr. W.

   <P>In Lambeth Marsh, too, was the Lyceum   of Erasmus King, the eccentric coachman, and of Cards, the rival of the eminent natural philosopher, Dr. Desaguliers. From the force of his master's example, though he had received only the poorest education, he came to read lectures and to exhibit experiments in physics publicly.

This is traditionally said to have been part of a residence of Bishop Bonner, which formerly extended a considerable way further in front. <QUOTE>There is nothing in the history of this place,</QUOTE> adds Allen, <QUOTE>to prove that it belonged to any of the Bishops of London, except an entry of an ordination in Strype's  <Q>Memorials of Cranmer,</Q>  which mentions the same to have taken place  <Q>in the chapel of my lord the Bishop of London in the Lower Marsh, Lambeth.</Q> </QUOTE> In this instance Strype was in error, and, as he subsequently acknowledged, had inadvertently written London instead of Rochester. <QUOTE>The ordination,</QUOTE> says Mr. Tanswell, in his <QUOTE>History of Lambeth,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>really took place at La Place, the house of John Hilsey, Bishop of Rochester.

   <P>In Lower Marsh is the <QUOTE>Spanish Patriot,</QUOTE> an inn which owes its sign to the temporary excitement which arose in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, at the time of our proposed intervention in the question of the Spanish succession. <pb id="P.416" n="416"> 
    <P>At the corner of York Street, with its principal entrance in the Lower Marsh, stands All Saints'  Church, which was erected in <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>-<num value="45">45</num>, from the designs of Mr. William Rogers, at a cost of about  <measure value="6400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6400">6,400</num></measure>.   It is in the Anglo-Norman style of architecture.   The principal entrance opens into a long corridor from a recessed arch, decorated with zigzag and other mouldings, wrought in the basement storey of a well-proportioned campanile tower of <num value="3">three</num> storeys, surmounted by a slender spire. The interior consists of a nave and aisles, terminated by a recessed angular chancel, which is lit in a subdued manner by a semi-dome skylight filled with stained glass. Attached to the church, in York Street, are All Saints' National and Infant  Schools, which were opened for the reception of children in <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>Crossing Westminster Bridge Road, we enter the narrow winding thoroughfare called Lambeth  Upper Marsh.   Here, on the left side, between the Westminster Bridge Road and Stangate Street, stands the Canterbury Hall, the <num value="1">first</num> music-hall established in the metropolis, which was opened by Mr. Charles Morton in the year <datestruct value="1849"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>. <QUOTE>The  Upper Marsh, Westminster Road,</QUOTE> writes Mr. J.  E. Ritchie, in the <QUOTE>Night-side of London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>is what may be called a low neighbourhood.   It is not far from Astley's Theatre. Right through it runs the South-Western Railway, and everywhere about it are planted pawnbrokers' shops, with an indescribable amount of dirty <num value="2">second</num>-hand clothes, and monster gin-palaces, with unlimited plate-glass and gas-lights. Go along there at what hour you will, these gin-palaces are full of ragged children, hideous old women, and drunken men.  The bane and the antidote are thus side by side.     ...   Let us pass on. A well-lighted entrance attached to a public-house indicates that we have reached our destination. We proceed up a few stairs, along a passage, lined with handsome engravings, to a bar, where we pay sixpence if we take a seat in the body of the hall, and ninepence if we ascend into the gallery. We make our way leisurely along the floor of the building, which is really a handsome hall, well lighted, and capable of holding <num value="1500">1,500</num> persons; the balcony extends round the room in the form of a horse-shoe. At the opposite end to that which we enter is the platform, on which are placed a grand piano and a harmonium, on which the performers play in the intervals when the professional singers have left the stage. The chairman sits just beneath them. It is dull work to him; but there he must sit, drinking, and smoking cigars, from <num value="7">seven</num> till <datestruct value="12"><year reg="12">twelve</year></datestruct> o'clock.      . .     . The room   is crowded, and almost every gentleman present has a pipe or a cigar in his mouth.   Let us look around us.   Evidently the majority present are respectable mechanics or small tradesmen, with their wives and daughters and sweethearts.   Now and then you see a midshipman, or a few fast clerks and warehousemen.    ...   Every <num value="1">one</num> is smoking, and every <num value="1">one</num> has a glass before him; but the class that come here are economical, and chiefly confine themselves to pipes and porter. The presence of ladies has also a beneficial effect: I see no signs of intoxication. I may question the worth of some of the stanzas sung, and I think I may have heard sublimer compositions, but, compared with many of the places frequented by both sexes in London, Canterbury Hall is, in my opinion, a respectable place; though, to speak seriously, I have my doubts whether all go home quite sober.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The <QUOTE>Canterbury Arms,</QUOTE> a public-house still existing in <QUOTE>the Marsh,</QUOTE> was the foundation of the  Canterbury Hall.   Here, at the time when Mr.  Morton took possession of it, was held a <QUOTE>singsong,</QUOTE> or harmonic meeting, in a room above the bar. Mr. Morton gradually expanded this style of conviviality into a musical entertainment, which, composed of <QUOTE>operatic selections,</QUOTE> together with sentimental and comic singing by some competent 
 <hi rend=italics>artistes</hi>, soon became a great success. Mr. John  Caulfield was the chairman of the concerts, and  Mr. Ferdinand Jonghmans the musical director, and the talent was the best that could be procured; some of the salaries reaching <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure> a week.   From time to time enlargements have been made in the building, and these successive enlargements have always been carried out without a suspension of the entertainments.

He often wandered over the then dreary region of St. George's Fields with an old bibliopolist, detailing and discussing all the superstitious legends of Germany and Great Britain.   A very jolly party used then to assemble at a tavern in St. James's Market, and, to dispel Grimaldi's gloom, a friend took him thither. He soon left the room, saying, <QUOTE>They laughed so much it made him more melancholy than ever.</QUOTE> His bookselling friend lent him a book called <QUOTE>The Uncertainty of the Signs of Death,</QUOTE> which so excited his mind with a fear of being buried alive, that in his will he directed that his daughter should, previous to his interment, sever his head from his body. The operation was actually performed in the presence of the daughter, though not by her hand.   As a proof of the morbidity of the signor's mind upon the subject of interment, he was wont to wander to different churchyards, as Charles Bannister said, to pick out a dry spot to lie snug in. He originally invented the celebrated skeleton scene, since so common in pantomimes; and <num value="1">first</num> represented   the <QUOTE>Cave of Petrifaction,</QUOTE> in which, when any <num value="1">one</num> entered, he was supposed to be struck at once and for ever into the position in which he stood when his unhallowed foot <num value="1">first</num> profaned the mysterious locality.

   <P>Carlisle   Lane, which runs from   Westminster Bridge Road to the eastern wall of Lambeth Palace, keeps in remembrance Carlisle House, which stood here between the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> and <num value="16">sixteenth</num> centuries. It was originally the palace of the Bishops of Rochester, and was then called La Place; but afterwards becoming the property of the bishopric of Carlisle, it was called Carlisle House. Down to the year <datestruct value="1827"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, the site of the mansion was occupied by Carlisle House Boarding School. Early in the <num value="12">twelfth</num> century, Baldwin, Archbishop of Canterbury, attempted to found a college or monastery for secular canons on this spot; but this attempt appears to have been unsuccessful: only a chapel, which was dedicated to St. Stephen and St. Thomas, having been erected. Baldwin's successor, Hubert Walter, entered into a treaty with the Prior of Rochester (the then owner of the land) for the whole manor of Lambeth, which was exchanged to him, he granting to the bishops of that see, out of it, a piece of ground next to the above-mentioned chapel, in order to erect an occasional residence as their town-house. On this ground Gilbert de Glanville, Bishop of Rochester, erected a house for himself and his successors, who occasionally resided there till the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century. Haymo de Hethe, who was promoted to the see of Rochester in <datestruct value="1316--"><year reg="1316">1316</year></datestruct>, rebuilt the house, which was subsequently called La Place, till the year <datestruct value="1500"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct>, after which the bishops dated from their <QUOTE>house in Lambeth Marsh.</QUOTE> The last Bishop of Rochester who dwelt in this mansion was Dr. John Fisher. He was nearly poisoned by Richard Roose, his cook, who infused a deadly poison into some soup which he was making, and which, as a matter of fact, caused the deaths of <num value="17">seventeen</num> members of the household, and of <num value="2">two</num> poor people who had gone to the house for charity. An appropriate punishment was devised for this murderous cook, for he was <QUOTE>attainted of high treason, and boiled to death in Smithfield.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1540--"><year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct> Bishop Heath conveyed this house to the Crown, in exchange for a house in Southwark. Henry VIII. granted it to Robert Aldrich, Bishop of Carlisle, and his successors, in exchange for certain premises in the Strand, on the site now occupied by Beaufort Buildings. In <datestruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct> it was sold by the Parliament to Matthew Hardyng; but on the Restoration it reverted to the see of Carlisle. <QUOTE>From this date,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Tanswell, in his <QUOTE>History of Lambeth,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>its history exhibits some remarkable vicissitudes. On part of the premises a pottery was established, which   existed in George II.'s time; but going to decay, the kilns and a curious Gothic arch were taken down, and the bricks used for filling the space and other defects in the wall. It was subsequently opened by <num value="1">one</num> Castledine as a tavern, and became a common stew; and on his demise it was occupied by Monsieur Froment, a dancing master, who endeavoured to get it licensed by the sessions as a public place of entertainment, but ineffectually, in consequence of the opposition of Archbishop Secker. It was next tenanted as a private dwelling; and was afterwards converted into an academy and boarding-school for young <pb id="P.418" n="418"> gentlemen. In the year <datestruct value="1827"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct> it was pulled down, and the site and grounds covered with about <num value="80">eighty</num> small houses, including Allen and Homer Streets and parts of Carlisle Lane and Hercules Buildings. Before it was built over, the grounds attached to this house were encompassed by a high and strong brick wall, which had in it a gate of ancient form, opening towards Stangate. A smaller back gate in the south wall had over it <num value="2">two</num> keys in saltire, and something resembling a mitre for a crest. <num value="2">Two</num> bricks, <num value="1">one</num> upon the other, served for a shield, and the workmanship of the arms was of as low a taste as the materials.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In a garden at Carlisle House was standing, in the middle of the last century, a mulberry-tree, which bore an excellent crop during the summer of <datestruct value="1753--"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct>. Its shade was nearly <num value="50">fifty</num> yards in circumference, and between <num value="4">four</num> and <num value="500">five hundred</num> pottles of fruit were gathered off it in <num value="1">one</num> summer, whilst the ground all under and around the tree looked as if soaked with blood, owing to people treading upon the fallen fruit. 
   <P>Another mansion of note here, in   former times, was Norfolk House, the residence of the old Earls and Dukes of Norfolk. It stood in Church Street, on the site now occupied by Messrs. Hodges' distillery and a range of buildings called Norfolk Row. The mansion remained in the possession of the Dukes of Norfolk till the commencement of Elizabeth's reign. The old duke, whose life was saved the night before his intended execution by the death of Henry VIII., and his son, the Earl of Surrey, the courtly poet and lover of the fair Geraldine, both resided here; and the latter studied here, under John Leland, the antiquary. On the attainder of Thomas Howard, the <num value="3">third</num> Duke of Norfolk of this family, the house was seized by the Crown, and granted by Edward VI. in fee to William Parr, Marquis of Northampton, by the title of <QUOTE>a capital mansion or house in Lambehith, late parcel of the possessions of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, and <num value="20">twenty</num> and a half acres of land in Cotman's Field; <num value="1">one</num> acre in St. George's Field upon Sandhill; <num value="6">six</num> acres of meadow and marsh in Lambehithe Marsh, whereof <num value="3">three</num> acres were within the wall of the marsh, and <num value="3">three</num> acres without; <num value="1">one</num> close, called Bell Close, abutting upon Cotman's Field towards the east, containing <num value="1">one</num> and a half

   <P>In Walcot Place, near Lambeth Walk, the notorious Mrs. George Anne Bellamy, after a life of profligacy and splendour, spent her declining years in poverty.

The mill, which stood here long before the introduction   of steam   into   the working of machinery, was a picturesque structure, built chiefly of wood, and with its <QUOTE>sails</QUOTE> had something of the appearance of an old-fashioned flour-mill.

<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.419.1">Queen Victoria laying Corner Stone of New St. Thomas' Hospital</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>At a house called the <QUOTE>Crown,</QUOTE> on the Surrey side of Westminster Bridge, was born, in <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, Dr. Martin Van Butchell, the eccentric physician, whom we have mentioned in our account of Mount Street.<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="335">335</num>.</NOTE>   Another eccentric resident in the Westminster Bridge Road, in former times, was the Chevalier D&lsquo;Eon, concerning whom there was so much doubt raised as to whether he was a man or a woman.   Angelo, in his <QUOTE>Reminiscences,</QUOTE> tells us that he used to see the Chevalier D&lsquo;Eon here. <QUOTE>He lived a few doors beyond Astley's Theatre. He always dressed in black silk, and looked like a woman worn out with age and care.</QUOTE> 
   <P>At the foot of Westminster Bridge, and extending along the bank of the river towards Lambeth Palace, is the new St. Thomas's Hospital, of the foundation of which, close by London Bridge, and its recent migration to the Surrey Gardens, we have already spoken.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, pp. <num value="89">89</num> and <num value="268">268</num>.</NOTE> The institution was removed hither in <datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>-<num value="71">71</num>. The ground on which the hospital stands-between <num value="8">eight</num> and <num value="9">nine</num> acres in extent--was purchased from the Board of Works, at a cost of about <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure>.   That part of the Thames known as Stangate Bank, where the hospital now stands, had long borne an ill reputeill- looking, ill-smelling, and of evil associations. Even the construction of the Houses of Parliament on the opposite shore-even the building of the handsomest bridge in Europe, that of Westminsterfailed to redeem the hideous aspect of its fore-shore, overladen as it was with dank tenements, rotten wharves, and dirty boat-houses. But the time came when it was decided to construct the Southern Thames Embankment, and the necessities of its formation compelled a large <QUOTE>reclamation</QUOTE> from the slimy fore-shores.   Of the whole site of the present St. Thomas's Hospital, nearly half of it, therefore, has been reclaimed from the mud of the river.   The buildings have a frontage of about <num value="1700">1,700</num> feet in length, and are about <num value="250">250</num> feet in depth. The hospital consists of no less than <num value="8">eight</num> distinct buildings, or pavilions. <num value="6">Six</num> in the centre are for patients; that at the north end, next to Westminster Bridge, is for the officers of the hospital, board-room, &amp;c.; that at the south for a museum, lecture-room, and school of medicine. The style of the buildings may be called Palladian, with rich facings of coloured bricks and Portland stone. There was some difficulty in getting a good foundation for the buildings, as there always is at Westminster or its neighbourhood; and towards the river front a depth of <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> feet had to be. excavated before the firm clay was reached. On this a solid basis of concrete was laid, and on this again, on massive brick piers, the structure was begun.   The blocks are built at a distance of <num value="125">125</num> feet from each other.   Though the blocks are each distinct buildings, they are all, in fact, coupled together by a double corridor, <num value="1">one</num> of which runs along the river front to the west, and <num value="1">one</num> along the eastern face, near the gardens of Lambeth Palace. This latter corridor is entirely glazed in, and has a solid roof, with a balcony, which can be used either as a promenade in fine weather for patients, or, what it is really built for, an easy means of access to the <num value="2">second</num> floors of the hospital, with all of which it communicates.   The front corridor is a very handsome   stone arcade, but open on its western side towards the Thames.   This is used as a promenade for the patients who are recovering, and a most pleasant walk it is; for the front of the hospital, towards the river-and, indeed, the back as well--is laid out in gardens and planted with trees. 
   <P>Each pavilion has <num value="3">three</num> tiers of wards above the ground floor, and in the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="5">five</num> pavilions the main wards occupy the whole building on the river side of the corridor. They are <num value="28">28</num> feet in width, <num value="120">120</num> feet in length, and   <num value="15">15</num>   feet in height, with flat ceilings throughout, and each have accommodation for <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> beds, with a cubic capacity of <num value="1800">1,800</num> feet for each patient. This capacity is largely due to the ample floor space, which affords abundant room for the attendance of students and for the requirements of clinical teaching. The beds are placed <num value="8">eight</num> feet apart from   centre to centre, and the windows are arranged alternately with the beds, at a level to enable the patients to look out of them. There are also large end   lights communicating with sheltered balconies towards the river, in which patients may be placed on couches or chairs in fine weather.   On the ground floor there are smaller wards, which are used chiefly for the reception of accidents, and which make up the total number of beds in each pavilion to about <num value="100">100</num>. At the corridor end of each large ward the entrance passage is carried between smaller rooms, a ward kitchen, a sisters'-room, a consultation-room, and a small ward.   These small wards are for the reception of patients who have undergone severe operations, or who for any reason require unusual quietude or exceptional treatment. At the river end there is a lateral projection at each angle of the pavilion; and these projections contain on <num value="1">one</num> side a bath-room and lavatory, on the other <pb id="P.420" n="420"> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.420" n="2000.14.0154"><HEAD>St. Thomas's Hospital.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="P.421" n="421"> side a scullery and offices, all cut off from the wards themselves by intercepting lobbies. Natural ventilation has been as much as possible depended on, with simple auxiliary arrangements for cold and boisterous nights. The warming is effected mostly by open fire-places, as the most healthy mode, with the addition of a warm-water system for use in very cold weather. It is, perhaps, almost needless to say that the whole structure is fire-proof. The floors of each storey are laid on iron girders covered with concrete, the actual upper floor of each ward being made of thin, broad planks of oak.   The walls of each ward, too, are coated with Parian cement, which, while not so cold, is almost as hard and non-absorbent of noxious gases, and quite as smooth, as marble itself. 
  <P><num value="4">Four</num> of these great hospital blocks which we have described, each go feet high by about <num value="250">250</num> feet deep, are set apart for the reception of male patients.   These are on the north side of the central hall; the <num value="2">two</num> on the southern side are for women only.   On each   side there is a large operating theatre for men and women, capable of containing <num value="600">600</num> students with ease whenever an important operation draws such a number together. 
<FIGURE id="Fig.421" n="2000.14.0155"><HEAD>The Entrance-Hall, St. Thomas's Hospital.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 With these theatres the covered corridors communicate directly from the wards. There is a special wing, if we may so term it, set apart in <num value="1">one</num> of the northern blocks, and adjoining the matron's residence, which is used for the training of skilled nurses, whose services, as they become thoroughly proficient in their duties, are made available as matrons in hospitals all over the kingdom, through the agency of the Council of the Nightingale Fund. The <QUOTE>pupil nurses,</QUOTE> who must be well-educated, intelligent young women, from   <num value="23">twenty-three</num> to <num value="35">thirty-five</num> years of age, are trained here for <num value="1">one</num> year in the practice of hospital nursing, and are provided during that time with comfortable home, board, uniform clothing, and small salary. At the end of the year, if qualified, they may expect good situations as hospital nurses, with liberal wages, usually commencing at <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>. 
   <P>The low building at the end nearest Lambeth Palace is the medical school. The admission fees for medical students, for unlimited attendance at practice and lectures, is <num value="100">100</num> guineas; for dental students (for <num value="2">two</num> years), <measure value="45l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="45">45</num></measure>.   Special entries may be made to any lectures or to hospital practice, and a modified scale of fees is arranged for students <pb id="P.422" n="422"> entering in <num value="2">second</num> or subsequent years.   There are special classes for the <num value="1">first</num> M.B. and preliminary scientific examinations of the University of London, and private classes for matriculation and other examinations.   Gentlemen can attend the above classes without becoming students to the hospital.   Qualified practitioners are admitted to the hospital practice, lectures, and library, on payment of <num value="10">ten</num> guineas for unlimited   attendance. <num value="2">Two</num>   scholarships founded   here perpetuate the names of Alderman Sir John Musgrove and Sir William Tite; there are also several college prizes, ranging from <measure value="5l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5">5</num></measure> to <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>, and also awards of silver and gold medals.   <num value="2">Two</num> house physicians and <num value="2">two</num> assistant house physicians, <num value="2">two</num> house surgeons and <num value="2">two</num> assistant house surgeons, and the resident accoucheur, are selected from students holding qualifications; an ophthalmic assistant, with a salary of <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure>, is appointed; clinical clerks and dressers to in and out patients are selected from gentlemen attending the hospital; <num value="2">two</num> registrars, at an honorarium   of   <measure value="40l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40">40</num></measure> each, are chosen from <num value="3">third</num> or <num value="4">fourth</num> year's students. There are also numerous minor appointments of anatomical assistants, prosestors, obstetric clerks, &amp;c., open to the students without charge. 
    <P>The   entrance-hall, facing   the new   Lambeth  Palace Road, is a large and spacious apartment.  In it is a statue of the Queen, by whom the foundation-stone of the hospital was laid in <datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>, and the building opened in <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>.   The statue, which was executed by Mr. Noble, is sculptured out of a block of pure white Carrara marble, and weighs <num value="5">five</num> tons.  The Queen is represented seated on a state chair, in her full robes of state, holding the sceptre in her right hand and the orb in the left hand. The left arm rests upon an arm of the chair, the right hand being brought forward and resting in the lap.  The feet rest upon a footstool, and are, to some extent, hidden by drapery. The likeness of Her  Majesty is admitted to be excellent.   The pedestal upon which the statue stands is of Sicilian marble, beautifully moulded and carved, with panels in the centre on each side.   The front portion of the pedestal has a circular projection, and within the panel immediately under the statue is the following inscription :-- <QUOTE>Her Majesty Queen Victoria. The gift of Sir John Musgrove, Bart., President, <datestruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> 
   <P>There is a chapel which affords sittings for more than <num value="300">300</num> persons; there are large and spacious surgeries and dispensers' offices, with ample house accommodation for chaplains, resident surgeons, dressers, &amp;c. Altogether, the hospital can make up <num value="650">650</num> beds for patients; and contains, from <num value="1">first</num> to last, in all its wards, houses, out-offices, kitchens, sculleries, stores, and cellars, nearly <num value="1000">1,000</num> distinct compartments.   The mortuary-house and museum are close by the medical school, at the extreme southern end.   The extreme northern end abuts close upon the Surrey side of Westminster Bridge; in fact, there is an opening by a flight of steps which gives direct access from the abutment to the north end of the hospital buildings which rise above it. All the structures occupy together about <num value="4">four</num> acres, leaving <num value="4">four</num> and a half acres laid out as garden ground, in <hi rend=italics>parterres</hi> and thick plantations, for the use and recreation of the patients. The out-patients do not enter the hospital proper at --all, but come by the new Palace Road, at the east end of the buildings, and pass at once into the men's or women's waiting-rooms; and these again are sub-divided into medical and surgical departments. 
    <P>Altogether, the plan of St. Thomas's Hospital may be considered perfect; and though it cost in all at least half a million of money, it is a cheap outlay for the good it is certain to effect for ages to come.   As an addition to the great public edifices of the metropolis, it certainly will not be surpassed in appearance by any of the splendid structures which of late years have done so much to enrich and improve London. 
    <P>As stated above, the space between the grounds of St. Thomas's Hospital and the river, extending from Westminster to Lambeth Bridges, a distance of <num value="2200">2,200</num> feet, is filled in by a good solid embankment, which was commenced in <datestruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>, and opened for pedestrians in the space of about <num value="2">two</num> years.  The work, called the Albert Embankment, which is continued beyond Lambeth Bridge, as far as the site of the London Gas Works, <num value="2100">2,100</num> feet higher up the river, was carried out by the Metropolitan  Board of Works, under the direction of Sir Joseph  Bazalgette, their engineer-in-chief; and it forms part of the great design of embanking the Thames in its course through London, which we have described in a previous part of this work.<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="322">322</num>, <hi rend=italics>et sec.</hi></NOTE> Although open only for foot-passengers, the Albert Embankment is precisely similar in its construction, as seen from the river, to the Victoria and Chelsea Embankments on the Middlesex side of the river. Turning down the embankment stairs, at the foot of the northern end of St. Thomas's Hospital, the pedestrian has before him   the finest footway in London, but a footway only.   When he has walked along this for rather more than a quarter of a mile, let him stop and look back.   If it be a fairly clear day, clear enough for him to see across the river and as far <pb id="P.423" n="423"> as the bridge, he may admire <num value="1">one</num> of the finest architectural views in London: all the finer if a flood-tide and a fleet of barges and steamers fill the river with life. The scene at this point has been thus described by a writer in the <hi rend=italics>Times.</hi>
Having, in imagination, conducted the pedestrian to this spot, he proceeds :-- <QUOTE>The Thames,  <Q>without o&lsquo;erflowing, full,</Q> <NOTE>This application of Denham's well-known lines was made before the river had begun periodically to <Q>overflow</Q> the lower parts of Lambeth and Southwark, as we shall see presently.</NOTE> spreads at his feet, fenced in and spanned by <num value="3">three</num> great public works, the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Bridge, and St. Thomas's Hospital, forming, as it were, <num value="3">three</num> sides of a hollow   square.   Of the long and stately front of the Houses of Parliament, surmounted by the great clock and flag towers and graceful intermediate pinnacles; of the symmetrical lines of the arches and piers of the bridge rising out of the water, with their massive and eternal look, he has, of course, a full view.   The colonnaded blocks of the great hospital, which towered above him as he walked, and seemed so much vaster than he had any idea they were till he came close under them, will be seen-and perhaps it is as well-rather <hi rend=italics>en profile.</hi>
He will acknowledge that, all stained as it is, the river has something to thank the City for. When Spenser could sing to it and call it  <Q>silver streaming,</Q>  its banks hereabouts and lower down   had little to grace them besides

The fish have died out of it, and, higher up, the swans   cannot keep   themselves white; but in Spenser's day the Thames did not wear such a tiara as that bridge, it did not roll its waters smoothly between granite walls, and Westminster and Lambeth did not look down on it so proudly as they do now with their Houses of Parliament and hospital. These are great and costly works, and a little farther on the picturesque battlements of the Archbishop of Canterbury's half-house, halfcastle, with the dreary, heavy-capped turrets of Millbank, will give him   an opportunity of quoting Byron's incorrect line- 
           <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>A palace and a prison on each hand.</QUOTE></QUOTE>

   <P>Attempts at gardening have been made on the Albert Embankment, in the vicinity of Lambeth Palace, but not with the success attending that carried out on the northern side of the river. Trees, too, have been planted; but in the course of a few years the whole of those from Lambeth Bridge<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="5">5</num>.</NOTE>
westwards had to be removed, the reason assigned being that the exhalations from the adjacent potteries had destroyed their vitality. 
   <P>The Southern Embankment of the Thames is not, as we have shown in a previous chapter,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="387">387</num>.</NOTE> a new   scheme.   In the <QUOTE>History of London,</QUOTE> by Fearnside and Harral, published in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>, it is stated that <QUOTE>a proposition has received the City's approval for a splendid quay from   London to Vauxhall. This, if carried into effect, will render the banks of old Father Thames unrivalled for beauty and   convenience, and approach a little towards the Parisian method of managing these matters.</QUOTE> The primaly object in embanking the Thames, particularly on the southern side, was to prevent the recurrence of floods, in consequence of a great part of Lambeth and Southwark lying much below the level of the river at hig-hwater mark; but this having been carried out no farther eastward than Westminster Bridge, has left matters much in the same condition as they were before, or possibly worse: for since the construction of the Victoria Embankment it is asserted that considerably more damage has been done in the lowlying districts than was the case before by the river overflowing its banks so much more frequently. A Select Committee of the House of Commons in <datestruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct> reported that the Embankment of the southern side of the Thames was a matter, not of local but of metropolitan importance, and that, as such, it ought to be taken in hand by the Metropolitan Board of Works.   This task, however, the Board declined, and consequently the local authorities became naturally embarrassed. Some private owners of property abutting upon the river have at times executed works for the purpose of preventing any expected overflow; but these have been only of a temporary character.   In a memorial of the inhabitants of Lambeth, presented to the Home Secretary since the above refusal on the part of the Board of Works, the memorialists held that, irrespective of any pecuniary question, <QUOTE>not only what is necessary in the present, but what may be necessary and desirable in the future, renders it expedient that the whole bank of the river should be under the control of a metropolitan authority, so that uniformity and completeness may be secured, and the metropolis may derive the fullest advantage from any public expenditure. The prevention of tidal overflows being declared to be a matter of metropolitan concern, can be dealt with only by an authority representing the metropolis ; and, as the Metropolitan Board declines to accept the resolution of the Select Committee, your memorialists <pb id="P.424" n="424"> have no alternative but to approach the Government, and to pray for relief from the present deadlock by the prompt passing of a Bill, framed in accordance with the resolution of the Select Committee.</QUOTE> It is to be hoped, in the interests of common humanity, that Parliament will enforce its decision on this head without delay. 
    <P>Among the causes which have contributed to the growth of Lambeth, we must mention the manufactories which have been founded here at various times, forming centres of active industry, and consequently of population.   More than <num value="200">200</num> years ago, <num value="2">two</num> Dutchmen established a pottery, and about the middle of the last century <num value="2">two</num> other potteries were opened here.   The chief work in this line now carried on in Lambeth is at <LEMMA id="lemma.424.1">the pottery of the  Messrs. Doulton</LEMMA>, the producers of the celebrated  Lambeth <hi rend=italics>faience</hi>, and whose name is worthy of record as the revivers, in the last few years, of the manufacture of Flemish and German stoneware, which promise to make the name of Lambeth celebrated once more in the annals of art. They are also the revivers of the white cream-coloured ware, known as Queen's Ware, from the fact that Queen  Charlotte admired it so much when manufactured by Wedgwood. <QUOTE>It is not many years ago,</QUOTE> observes a writer in the <hi rend=italics>Queen</hi> newspaper (<datestruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE>since Messrs. Doulton, of Lambeth, began their career as art potters, having until then only been celebrated for chimney-pots, drain-pipes, ink and blacking bottles. And a marvellous success they have achieved in this short space of time. Everybody knows their admirable imitation of Gris de  Flandres, surface-etched and embossed, tinted in colours which equal those on the ancient ware.  Their terra-cotta ornaments are the delight of architects, not only for their lasting properties, which will stand even an   English   climate for centuries, but equally so for their decorative merits.                 The great artistic feature of Lambeth 
<hi rend=italics>faience</hi> seems to lie in the direction of landscape and figure painting; and the success which has been achieved in this direction, it may be added, is mainly due to the Lambeth School of Art, which has long been carried on under the fostering care of the great river-side potters.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Established in the year <datestruct value="1854"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct> by the Rev. William  Gregory, then vicar of St. Mary's, Lambeth, as a branch of the Central School of Design at Marlborough House, this was really the <num value="1">first</num> Art School of Design in the kingdom: as, indeed, it should be.  The Lambeth school went on steadily increasing until <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, when the <LEMMA id="lemma.424.2">Prince of Wales laid the foundation-stone</LEMMA> of the present building.   Since that time, the exertions of its director, Mr. John Sparks, have been unremitting in educating painters and modellers for Messrs. Doulton's works. With sound   psychological judgment, he selected his pupils from the fair sex, well knowing the natural artistic feeling of women and girls would lighten his arduous task of reviving an art-industry once before flourishing in the very same locality, but long forgotten.   Besides, by excluding foreigners from his school, he wanted to prove that there is exquisite taste and endless inventive power latent in Englishmen and   Englishwomen, which only want bringing out by proper teaching and training. <QUOTE>Our English hands,</QUOTE> he says, in <num value="1">one</num> of his lectures, <QUOTE>are as skilful, our heads as clear, our thoughts as poetical, our lives as high, as any other people's; and still we find French modellers giving the work of the largest Staffordshire potters an European fame; French modellers making the works of our great silversmiths and electrotypists; Belgian stonecarvers cutting Romanism into Protestant reredos; and Germans, whose name is Legion, and whose motto is <Q lang=la>Ubique,</Q> filling our drawing-offices all over the country.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>These things should not be,</QUOTE> concludes Mr. Sparks; and that they need not be he has proved through his pupils' achievements in Lambeth <hi rend=italics>faience.</hi>

    <P>Besides the potteries, the principal manufactures of this parish are white lead, shot, glass, &amp;c.; but none have been so celebrated as the Vauxhall plate-glass. In the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century the Venetians were the only people who had the secret of making looking-glasses.; but about the year <datestruct value="1670"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct> a number of Venetian artists having arrived in England, headed by <num value="1">one</num> Rosetti, and under the patronage of the Duke of Buckingham, a manufactory was established at Vauxhall, and carried on with such success, by the firm of Dawson, Bowles, and Co., as to excel the Venetians or any other nation in blown plate-glass. Evelyn, in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> records a visit which he paid to this establishment. Under date of <datestruct VALUE="1676-09-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>, he writes:-- <QUOTE>To  Lambeth, to that rare magazine of marble, to take order for chimney-pieces for Mr. Godolphin's house.  The owner of the works had built for himself a pretty dwelling-house; this Dutchman, had contracted with the Genoese for all their marble. We also saw the Duke of Buckingham's glass works, where they make huge vases of mettal as cleare, ponderous, and thick as chrystal; also lookingglasses far larger than any that come from Venice.</QUOTE> The emoluments acquired by the proprietors of the above-mentioned establishment are stated to have been very large; but in the year <datestruct value="1780"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, in consequence of a difference between them   and the workmen, a total stop was put to this great <pb id="P.425" n="425"> manufactory, and a descendant of Rosetti ungratefully left in poverty.   The site of this celebrated factory is now covered by Vauxhall Square. 
    <P>Pennant records, in terms of high approval, Mr.  Coade's manufacture of artificial stone, carried on in the street called Narrow Wall, of which we have already made mention.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="387">387</num>.</NOTE>   He likewise describes  Lambeth as remarkable for another and altogether different branch of industry, namely, the manufacture of English wines, and also for the growth of the vines from which they were made. He writes: <QUOTE>The genial banks of the Thames opposite to our capital yield almost every species of white wine; and by a wondrous magic, Messrs. Beaufoy here pour forth the materials for the rich Frontiniac, destined to the more elegant tables, the Madeira, the Caleavella, and the Lisbon, into every part of the kingdom     . . . The foreign wines are most admirably mimicked.</QUOTE> We have already spoken of the growth of vines and the manufacture of wine in London, in our account of Vine Street,  Piccadilly.<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="253">253</num>.</NOTE>   From an entry in Pepys' <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> in <datestruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>, this place seems at <num value="1">one</num> time to have been equally famous for its ale; at all events, we here read how that the genial Secretary of the Admiralty went <QUOTE>out with Mr. Shepley and Alderman  Backwell to drink Lambeth ale.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Another thriving branch of industry connected with Lambeth, in which employment is given to a large number of hands, is the doll manufactory of  Messrs. Edwards, in Waterloo Road. Then, again, various chemical, soap, and bone-crushing works have also been established; and Maudslay's engineering works in the Westminster Bridge Road, on the site of the old Apollo Gardens,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="389">389</num>.</NOTE>   have become a centre of industry. 
    <P>Among the <QUOTE>noted residents</QUOTE> in Lambeth, not already mentioned by us, were Mr. and Mrs. Zachary Macaulay, the parents of Lord Macaulay, who occupied a small house here for the <num value="1">first</num> year of their married life; their illustrious son, however, was born, not in Lambeth, but in Leicestershire. 
   <P>Here, too, at <num value="1">one</num> time lived, in Lambeth Road, the eccentric artist, George Morland, whom we have already introduced to our readers at Paddington.<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="222">222</num>.</NOTE>
He was most clever in his delineation of cottage interiors and low hostelries, with their accessories of donkeys, pigs, &amp;c.; and it is recorded of him that at Lambeth he had several <num value="4">four</num>-footed lodgers, including <num value="1">one</num> of the long-eared tribe. 
   <P>John Timbs, in his <QUOTE>Clubs and Club Life,</QUOTE> says that the Stanleys at <num value="1">one</num> time had a house here, and that the <QUOTE>Eagle and Child,</QUOTE> the sign of an adjoining inn, is really taken from the crest of the family. 
    <P>Guy Fawkes, too, it is said, had a house in  Lambeth, where he and his fellows in the <QUOTE>Gunpowder Plot</QUOTE> stored their ammunition.   If this really was ever the case, its site is forgotten. 
    <P>It is to be feared that the accommodation for the poor in parts of this parish is, or was in <datestruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>, most disgracefully inadequate; for, if we may trust  Dr. Stallard's work on <QUOTE>London Pauperism,</QUOTE> a man, his wife, and <num value="3">three</num> children were found occupying a front room, only <num value="12">twelve</num> feet square, within a few yards of Westminster Bridge Road. 
    <P>In a previous chapter we have enumerated the wards or districts into which the parish of Lambeth is divided;<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="383">383</num>.</NOTE> we may here add that, in conformity with the provisions of the Reform Bill, passed in <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>, Lambeth was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="4">four</num> metropolitan parishes which was erected into a Parliamentary borough, since which period it has regularly returned <num value="2">two</num> members to St. Stephen's.   At that time the number of the inhabitants was <num value="87856">87,856</num>.  In the course of the next <num value="20">twenty</num> years this had expanded to <num value="161072">161,072</num>; and at the time of taking the census in <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct> the population numbered no less than <num value="380000">380,000</num>. Lambeth has returned, at all events, <num value="2">two</num> distinguished members to St. Stephen's --the Right Hon. Charles Tennyson D&lsquo;Eyncourt, and Sir Benjamin Hawes, the son of a great soapboiler, who was <num value="1">one</num> of its <num value="1">first</num> representatives, and retained his seat for the borough for <num value="15">fifteen</num> years.   Another of its members, Mr. William  Roupell, who was elected in the year <datestruct value="1857"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>, subsequently acquired some celebrity-but not of a very enviable kind; for having been convicted of forgery, he was transferred to a convict prison. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>, under an Act of Parliament and an  Order in Council, Lambeth, as well as its neighbour  Southwark, was made to form part of the diocese of Rochester. 
    <P>From these dry prosaic matters to the realms of fancy the change is refreshing. We will, therefore, conclude this chapter by reminding the reader of the dream   of Charles Lamb, in   his essay on <QUOTE>Witches and other Night Fears.</QUOTE> He dreams that, having been riding <QUOTE>upon the ocean billows at some sea-nuptials,</QUOTE> he found the waves gradually subsiding into what he calls <QUOTE>a river motion,</QUOTE> and that the river was <QUOTE>no other than the gentle Thames, which landed him, in the wafture of a placid wave or <num value="2">two</num>, alone, safe, and inglorious, somewhere at the foot of Lambeth Palace.</QUOTE> Thither we will now proceed. <pb id="P.426" n="426">

<P> <QUOTE>Immediately opposite to the Abbey and Palace of Westminster,</QUOTE> writes Dr. R. Paulli, in his <QUOTE>Pictures of Old England,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>rose the castellated walls and towers and chapel of the princely residence which the Archbishops of Canterbury had chosen, before the close of the <num value="12">twelfth</num> century, as their town residence, in the immediate neighbourhood of the offices of state and the tribunals of justice.</QUOTE> And there, he might have added, it rises still, and frowns down with mediaeval and almost feudal grandeur upon the waters of the river as they flow calmly on towards the sea, just as they did in the days of our Norman sovereigns.   The palace, it must be owned, wears a very solemn and even gloomy appearance, resembling a fortress rather than an episcopal palace; and there was a time when it rose still more conspicuous before the eyes of the citizens of London than now-we mean when the river was the <QUOTE>silent way</QUOTE> along which nearly all the traffic and the travellers passed. The reader will not forget Pope's reference to this palace in his description of the Thames, in emulation of Spenser, which we have quoted above, as a motto to this chapter. <pb id="P.427" n="427">

   <P>The quiet gardens and venerable towers might almost be taken as a symbol of the archbishopric itself. <QUOTE>Its dingy brick, and solemn little windows, with the reverend ivy spreading everywhere about its walls,</QUOTE> writes Mr. A. C. Coxe, in his <QUOTE>Impressions of England,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>seemed to house the decent and comely spirit of religion itself: and <num value="1">one</num> could almost gather the true character of the Church of England from a single glance at this old ecclesiastical palace, amid the stirring and splendid objects with which   it is surrounded. Old, and yet not too old; retired, and yet not estranged from men; learned, and yet domestic; religious, yet nothing ascetic; and dignified, without pride or ostentation: such is the ideal of the Metropolitical palace on the margin of the Thames.   I thought, as I glided by, of the time when Henry stopped his barge just here to take in Archbishop Cranmer, and give him a taste of his royal displeasure; and of the time when Laud entered his barge at th.e same place to go by water to the Tower,  <Q>his poor neighbours of Lambeth following him with their blessings and prayers for his safe return.</Q>  They knew his better part.</QUOTE> 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.428.1">Archbishop Longley, <datestruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></datestruct></LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>As we have already seen, the manor of Lambeth was given by Goda, sister of Edward the Confessor, to the see of Rochester, in the <num value="11">eleventh</num> century. The manor was afterwards seized by William the Conqueror, who gave part of the lands to his halfbrother, Odo, Bishop of Bayeux. It was, however, ultimately restored to its former owners, the see of Rochester, <num value="1">one</num> of whose bishops, Glanville, erected here, at the close of the <num value="12">twelfth</num> century, a residence for himself and his successors whenever they visited the metropolis. The ancient possession of Lambeth by the see of Rochester is still commemorated by the payment to the latter, in <num value="2">two</num> half-yearly sums, of <measure value="5bmark" type=currency><num value="5">five</num> marks</measure> of silver, in consideration of the lodging, fire-wood, forage, and other accommodations which   the   Bishops   of Rochester had been accustomed to receive here whenever they visited London. This house being afterwards exchanged for other lands with Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, became the episcopal residence. Pennant tells us that it was the original intention of Archbishop Walter to have erected here a <QUOTE>College of Secular Monks</QUOTE> --he meant, of course, of <QUOTE>monks,</QUOTE> <hi rend=italics>not</hi> of <QUOTE>seculars</QUOTE> independent of those of Canterbury, but that circumstances obliged him to abandon his purpose. 
   <P>Archbishops Hubert Walter and Langton successively lived at the Episcopal Manor House at Lambeth.   The latter repaired it, as well as the palace at Canterbury.      His residence   here is proved by some public acts in <datestruct value="1209--"><year reg="1209">1209</year></datestruct>.   Of this house there is no account or description, and it seems it was afterwards neglected and became ruinous.   Archbishop Boniface, in <datestruct value="1216--"><year reg="1216">1216</year></datestruct>, as an expiation, it is said, for his outrageous behaviour to the prior of St. Bartholomew's in Smithfield, obtained a bull from   Pope Urban IV., among other things, to rebuild his houses at <QUOTE>Lamhie,</QUOTE> or to build a new <num value="1">one</num> on a different site, from which circumstance he is generally supposed to have been the <num value="1">first</num> founder of the present palace. It was gradually enlarged and improved by his successors, particularly by Chicheley, who enjoyed the primacy from   <datestruct value="1414--"><year reg="1414">1414</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1443--"><year reg="1443">1443</year></datestruct>. He was the builder of that portion of the palace known as the Lollards' Tower. <QUOTE>Neither Protestants nor Catholics,</QUOTE> says Pennant, <QUOTE>should omit visiting this tower, the cruel prison of the unhappy followers of Wickliffe. The vast staples and rings to which they were chained before they were brought to the stake ought to make Protestants bless the hour which freed them   from   so bloody a period. Catholics may glory that time has softened their zeal into charity for all sects, and made them blush at these memorials of the misguided zeal of our ancestors.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Cardinal Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury, who died in <datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct>, made many additions and improvements to the present palace.   He was the builder of the magnificent brick gateway or principal entrance at the north-west. 
   <P><LEMMA id="lemma.429.1">Warham</LEMMA> having acted as ambassador for King Henry VII. to the Duke of Burgundy, was, on his return in <datestruct value="1493--"><year reg="1493">1493</year></datestruct>, appointed Chancellor of Wells, and soon afterwards Master of the Rolls.   He was subsequently made Keeper of the Great Seal, then Chancellor; in <datestruct value="1503--"><year reg="1503">1503</year></datestruct> he was raised to the see of London, and in the year following was enthroned Archbishop of Canterbury.   In <datestruct value="1515--"><year reg="1515">1515</year></datestruct> Warham resigned the Chancellorship, which was bestowed on Cardinal Wolsey, and retired to his palace. He was succeeded, in <datestruct value="1533--"><year reg="1533">1533</year></datestruct>, by Thomas Cranmer, who, writes the author of <QUOTE>Lambeth and the Vatican,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>may be considered <num value="1">one</num> of the most distinguished men that Cambridge ever produced, and the most eminent prelate that ever filled the see of Canterbury.</QUOTE> The part which he took in favour of the divorce between Katharine of Aragon and Henry VIII. induced the king to nominate him archbishop; he was, therefore, eventually raised to the see of Canterbury, in which capacity he pronounced the divorce between Queen Katharine and Henry, and ratified his marriage with Anne Boleyn--a step which so ingratiated him into the favour of the king. Cranmer's zeal in the cause of the Reformed religion frequently led him into <pb id="P.429" n="429"> acts of severity towards those whose opinions differed from his own, from which even the spirit of the times and the barbarous inhumanity exercised by the Protestants abroad is neither an excuse nor an apology. On the death of Edward VI., Cranmer espoused the cause of Lady Jane Grey; Mary triumphed, and the ruin and martyrdom   of the archbishop speedily followed. 
   <P>To Cardinal Pole, who succeeded to the archbishopric, is attributed the foundation of the long gallery in Lambeth Palace. He was appointed to the deanery of Exeter by Henry VIII.; but was abroad when the king abolished the Papal authority in England, and, not attending when summoned to return, was proclaimed a traitor and divested of his deanery.   In <datestruct value="1536--"><year reg="1536">1536</year></datestruct> he was made cardinal; and when Mary ascended the throne he returned to England as legate from Pope Julius III., and had his attainder reversed by special Act of Parliament. <QUOTE>Few churchmen have borne so unblemished a reputation as this eminent prelate, and few have carried themselves with such moderation and meekness. He died <datestruct VALUE="1558-11-17"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=17>17</day>, <year reg=1558>1558</year></datestruct>, being the very day on which Queen Mary herself died.</QUOTE> 
   <P><LEMMA id="lemma.429.2">Matthew Parker</LEMMA> died here in <datestruct value="1575--"><year reg="1575">1575</year></datestruct>, and was buried in the chapel. After the Civil Wars, and in the time of the Commonwealth, when fanatical and political fury went hand in hand, it was found that every building devoted to piety had suffered more than they had done in all the rage of family contest. The fine works of art and the sacred memorials of the dead were, except in a few instances, sacrificed to Puritanical barbarism, or to sacrilegious plunder. Lambeth House--for by that name, and the Manor of Lambeth, the archbishops at that time distinguished their residence, and not by the modern title of palace-fell to the share of the miscreant regicides Scott and Hardynge, who pulled down the noble hall, the work of Chicheley, and sold the materials for their own profit. The chapel they turned into a dancing-room; and because the tomb of the venerable Archbishop Parker <QUOTE>stared them in the face and checked their mirth, it was broken to pieces, his bones dug up by Hardynge, to whose share this part of the palace fell; and opening the leaden coffin, and cutting away the cerecloths, of which there were many folds, the flesh seemed very fresh. The corpse thus stripped was conveyed into the outhouse for poultry and dung, and buried among the offal; but upon the restoration of King Charles, that wretch Hardynge was forced to discover where it was; whereupon the archbishop had him honourably re-interred in the same chapel near the steps of the altar.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The palace had for some time previous to this been used as a prison for the Royalists; Guy Carleton, Dean of Carlisle, was <num value="1">one</num> of the persons committed to it, but he fortunately escaped and quitted England.   Bishop Kennett says, that of near <num value="100">one hundred</num> ministers from   the west of England who were imprisoned at Lambeth almost all died of a pestilential fever. 
   <P>Passing by Grindall and Whitgift, we come to Archbishop Bancroft, who, as we shall presently have occasion to state more fully, began the fine library in this palace, and left his books to his successors for ever.   He died in <datestruct value="1610--"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct>, and was buried in Lambeth Church.   Of the other improvements in this venerable pile we shall speak in describing the buildings themselves. 
   <P> <QUOTE>With the exception of a Becket,</QUOTE> writes the author of <QUOTE>Select Views of London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>there are, it is supposed, traces of some public act done in this house by every archbishop, from the time when the monks of Rochester became possessed of it till its alienation; for though in some cases the name only of Lambeth is mentioned, yet it is so explicitly averred in others that the archbishops were at the manor house, that it may be presumed this was their regular inn.</QUOTE> 
   <P>With the exception of the chapel, the whole of the present structure has certainly been erected since the above-mentioned period. The palace, as it now appears, is an irregular but very extensive pile, exhibiting specimens of almost every style of architecture that has prevailed during the last <num value="700">seven hundred</num> years. The walls are chiefly built of a fine red brick, and are supported by stone buttresses, edged and coped with stone.   The <QUOTE><LEMMA id="lemma.429.3">great gate</LEMMA></QUOTE> is enumerated among the buildings of the palace in the stewards' accounts in the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> year of Edward II.   Cardinal Morton rebuilt it about the year <datestruct value="1490"><year reg="1490">1490</year></datestruct> in the manner we at present see it. The building, which is chiefly remarkable for its vast size, consists of <num value="2">two</num> immense square towers, with a spacious gateway and postern in the centre; it is built of red brick, with stone dressings, and is embattled.   The arch of the gateway is pointed, and the roof beautifully groined. Above, is a noble apartment, called the <QUOTE>Record Tower,</QUOTE> where, until lately, the archives of the see of Canterbury were deposited.   Access to the different storeys, now used chiefly as lumber-rooms, is obtained by spiral stairs in the towers. 
   <P>Passing through the gateway, we enter the outer court.   On the left is a low wall, partly covered with ivy, separating the palace demesnes from the Thames and what was once the favourite promenade known as Bishops' Walk, but now the Albert Embankment. In front appears the Water Tower, <pb id="P.430" n="430"> 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.430.1">Architectural Details of Library</LEMMA></NOTE>
 with the Lollards' Tower beyond ; and on the right 
<LEMMA id="lemma.430.2">the Great Hall</LEMMA>, now the library and manuscriptroom.   It is a lofty structure of brick, strengthened with buttresses, and ornamented with cornices and quoins of stone. It is nearly <num value="100">one hundred</num> feet in length, <num value="40">forty</num> in breadth, and <num value="50">fifty</num> in height. The roof is composed principally of oak, elaborately carved, and has in the centre a lofty and elegant lantern, at the top of which are the arms of the see of Canterbury impaling those of Juxon, and surmounted   by the archiepiscopal mitre.   The interior is lighted, in addition to the lantern, by ranges of high windows on either side, in some of which are heraldic devices in stained glass. Over the hall door appear the same arms as those above mentioned, together with the date MDCLXIII; and at the lower end is a screen of the Ionic order, on the top of which is the founder's crest, a negro's head crowned.   The whole hall is wainscoted to a considerable height, and the floor is handsomely paved. 
   <P>This hall was probably built originally by Archbishop Boniface in the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century.   In the stewards' account, above quoted, the <QUOTE>Great Hall</QUOTE> is mentioned.   It was <QUOTE>re-edified</QUOTE> by Archbishop Chicheley; and in <datestruct value="1570--"><year reg="1570">1570</year></datestruct> the roofing was <QUOTE>covered with shingles</QUOTE> by Archbishop Parker. During the Commonwealth the hall is said to have been pulled down, and the materials sold by Colonel Scott and Matthew Hardyng, to whom the manor of Lambeth had been granted.   The present hall was commenced after the Restoration by Archbishop Juxon, precisely on the site of its predecessor, and as nearly as possible after the ancient model; but it was not finished at his death. Juxon appears to have been so anxious concerning its erection, that he left the following direction in his will:-- <QUOTE>If I happen to die before the hall at Lambeth be finished, my executors to be at the charge of finishing it, according to the model made of it, if my successor shall give leave.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The reason why such large halls were built in the houses of ancient nobility and gentry was that there might be room to exercise the generous hospitality which prevailed among our ancestors, and which was, without doubt, duly exercised by most of the possessors of this mansion, though not particularly recorded. What great hospitality Cranmer maintained, we may judge by the following authentic list of his household-viz., <QUOTE>steward, treasurer, comptroller, gamators, clerk of the kitchen, caterer, clerk of the spicery, yeoman of ewry, bakers, pantlers, yeomen of the horse, ushers, butlers of wine and ale, larderers, squilleries, ushers of the hall, porter, ushers of the chamber, daily waiters in the great chamber, gentlemen ushers, yeomen of the chamber, carver, sewer, cup-bearer, grooms of the chamber, marshal, groom-ushers, almoner, cooks, chandler, butchers, master of the horse, yeomen of the wardrobe, and harbingers.</QUOTE> Cardinal Pole, his successor, had a patent from Philip and Mary to retain <num value="100">one hundred</num> servants, a fact which affords some idea of his hospitality and grandeur. 
    <P>Of the hospitality of Archbishop Parker, Strype gives us the following account :-- <QUOTE>In the daily eating this was the custom: the steward, with the servants that were gentlemen of the better rank, sat down at the tables in the hall at the right hand; and the almoner, with the clergy and the other servants, sat on the other side, where there was plenty of all sorts of provision, both for eating and drinking.   The daily fragment, thereof did suffice to fill the bellies of a great number of poor hungry people that waited at the gate; and so constant and unfailing was this provision at my lord's table, that whosoever came in, either at dinner or supper, being not above the degree of a knight, might there be entertained worthy of his quality, either at the steward's or at the almoner's table.   And, moreover, it was the archbishop's command to his servants that all strangers should be received and treated with all manner of civility and respect, and that places at the table should be assigned them according to their dignity and quality, which redounded much to the praise and commendation of the archbishop.   The discourse and conversation at meals was void of all brawls and loud talking, and for the most part consisted in framing men's manners to religion, or to some other honest and beseeming subject. There was a monitor in the hall; and if it happened that any spoke too loud, or concerning things less decent, it was presently hushed by <num value="1">one</num> that cried  <Q>Silence.</Q>   The archbishop loved hospitality, and no man showed it so much or with better order, though he himself was very abstemious.</QUOTE> 
   <P><LEMMA id="lemma.431.1">The great hall</LEMMA> is now used as a library. Ranged on each side along the walls are projecting bookcases, containing nearly <num value="30000">30,000</num> volumes, chiefly valuable for works relating to theology and ecclesiastical history and antiquities; these, however, are varied with old English poetry and romances, and topographical, heraldic, and genealogical works. A collection of books existed at an early period as an appendage to the archbishop's household; but the <num value="1">first</num> reliable date of the foundation of the present library is <datestruct value="1610--"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct>, in which year Archbishop Bancroft left by will <QUOTE>to his successors the Archbishops of Canterbury, for ever, a greate and famous <pb id="P.431" n="431"> library of bookes of divinity, and of many other sorts of learning,</QUOTE> provided they bound themselves to the necessary assurances for the continuance of such books to the archbishops successively; otherwise, they were to be bequeathed to the <QUOTE>publique library of the University of Cambridge.</QUOTE> Bancroft's successor-Archbishop Abbot (<datestruct value="1611--"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>-<num value="33">33</num>)-carried out these injunctions, and left his own books to the Lambeth library. But the civil war marked the crisis in the history of the collection, for when the Parliamentarians were about to seize on Lambeth Palace, the learned Selden, fearing the danger of total dispersion, suggested to the University of Cambridge their right to the books, in accordance with Bancroft's will, as above mentioned.   Very few of Archbishop Laud's books are here, nearly all of them having been presented to the library of St. John's College, Oxford. To Cambridge the Lambeth books were transferred and preserved, until, at the Restoration, they were recalled by Archbishop Juxon (<datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>-<num value="3">3</num>). That primate's death occurring before the books could be restored, it was left to his successor, Archbishop Sheldon, to see them replaced at Lambeth. This primate presented many books to the library; but not so his successor, Archbishop Sancroft, who, although he had many of the MSS. re-bound and preserved, yet on his resignation presented his collection to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, of which he had been master. From Archbishop Tillotson (<datestruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>-<num value="5">5</num>) we hear of no bequests; but his successor, Archbishop Tenison, bequeathed a portion of his library to Lambeth, a part to St. Paul's Cathedral, and the remainder to the library which he had founded in St. Martin's-in-the-Fields.<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="158">158</num>.</NOTE>   From <datestruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1757--"><year reg="1757">1757</year></datestruct>, when the see of Canterbury was filled by the primates Wake, Potter, Herring, and Hutton, few additions were made; but Archbishop Secker, who I followed next in order, will be gratefully remembered in the library annals as having given all the books in his own library, which included also many interesting pamphlets, to the archiepiscopal collection. To Archbishop Cornwallis we are indebted for presenting and causing the extensive collection of tracts to be bound and arranged. The names of Archbishops Manners-Sutton (<datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>-<num value="28">28</num>) and Howley (<datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>-<num value="48">48</num>) are associated with large bequests of theological lore to the library. 
   <P>The great hall was converted to its present use by Archbishop Howley in <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, previously to which time the books were arranged in some galleries over the cloisters which were then standing. The bequests of successive primates are generally distinguished by their arms or initials on the outside cover of the books, while autographs and memoranda on the title-pages record noted names, and supply links of ownership.   Among those autographs may be found the names of Cranmer; Foxe, the <QUOTE>martyrologist;</QUOTE> Tillotson; Tenison; Henry Wotton, the well-known writer on architecture; the more famous <num value="1">one</num> of Charles I., attached to a <QUOTE>Life of  Archbishop Laud;</QUOTE> and several of less note. It is in this way that the interest of the books is identified with much that is historical.   An exhaustive catalogue of the library and art treasures in the palace, with a full description of its illuminated manuscripts and ancient chronicles, was published in <datestruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct> by the Archbishop's librarian, Mr. S. W.  Kershaw.   Space does not admit of our entering at any great length into a description of the varied contents of this library; but we may state that among the ancient printed books is <num value="1">one</num> of great rarity: this is <QUOTE>The Chronicles of Great Britain,</QUOTE> and was printed by Caxton at Westminster in <datestruct value="1480--"><year reg="1480">1480</year></datestruct>.  There are about <num value="5">five</num> other works printed by Caxton in the library, although imperfect.   The <QUOTE>Golden  Legend,</QUOTE> printed by the celebrated Wynkyn de  Worde, also finds a place here; as also does the <QUOTE>Nuremberg Chronicle</QUOTE> (the   library had   <num value="2">two</num> copies), and the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century MSS., known as the <QUOTE>St. Alban's Chronicle.</QUOTE> Of illuminated MSS., there are about <num value="30">thirty</num> examples of the various styles of art in this library; <num value="1">one</num> of the most rare being the little MS. known as the <QUOTE>Gospels of  Mac Durnan,</QUOTE> written about the year <datestruct value="900"><year reg="900">900</year></datestruct>, and presented by King Athelstan to the City of Canterbury. The school of English art is represented most notably in the copy of the New Testament, printed   on vellum, known   as the <QUOTE>Mazarine,</QUOTE> from the fact of the <num value="1">first</num> copy having been discovered in the library of that cardinal. 
   <P>This Mazarine Bible, when complete, is of great rarity and value, and only <num value="4">four</num> <hi rend=italics>perfect vellum</hi>
copies are known. Another interesting example of English art is a MS. known as the <QUOTE>Dictyes and Sayings of the Philosophers;</QUOTE> and in this illumination the author is represented as introducing a tonsured personage, who presents a copy of the work to King Edward IV., accompanied by his queen and their son, afterwards Edward V. Walpole, in his <QUOTE>Royal and Noble Authors,</QUOTE> has given an engraving of this miniature, and it has also been engraved by Strutt. 
   <P>There is in the library only <num value="1">one</num> book which is known for certain to have belonged to Archbishop Parker, and that is a treatise entitled <QUOTE>De Antiquitate et Privilegiis Ecclesiae Cantuarensis.</QUOTE> The library contains, <hi rend=italics>inter alia</hi>, an original impression <pb id="P.432" n="432"> of the scarce plan of London by Aggas, together with a series of prints of the archbishops of the see from the Reformation downwards, collected by Archbishop Cornwallis. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct> a donation was made of theological books from the collection of the late Professor Selwyn, of Cambridge, <num value="1">one</num> of the honorary curators of this library. This gift supplied many deficiencies in modern works. 
   <P>Dr. Ducarel, who was the Archbishop's librarian, is recorded in <QUOTE>Walpoliana</QUOTE> as a <QUOTE>poor creature,</QUOTE> and not very anxious to oblige those who wanted to consult the library.   From some incidental hints given by Horace Walpole, it may be inferred that a century ago the Archiepiscopal Library was not very easily available to scholars and literary men. 
   <P><num value="1">One</num> late librarian, Dr. Samuel Maitland, who died in <datestruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>, deserves mention in these pages. Born about the year <datestruct value="1790"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, he graduated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was for some time a barrister of the Inner Temple.   He, however, applied himself to the study of church history, and 
<FIGURE id="Fig.432" n="2000.14.0158"><HEAD>The Lollards' Tower, Lambeth Palace.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 entering into orders, became librarian and keeper of manuscripts here, under Archbishop Howley, who conferred on him the Lambeth degree of D.D., in recognition of his learning and long and able services, and on whose death, in <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct>, he resigned his appointment. He was the author of many learned   works,   amongst which we may specify- 
<title><num value="2">Two</num> Inquiries into the Grounds   on   which   the Prophetic Period of Daniel and St. John has been supposed to consist of <num value="1260">1,260</num> years</title>; <title>The Dark   Ages: being a series of Essays, intended to illustrate   the State of Religion and Literature in the <num value="9">Ninth</num>, Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Centuries</title>; <title>Essays on Subjects connected with   the   Reformation in England</title>; <title>Eruvin, or Miscellaneous Essays on subjects connected with the Nature, History, and Destiny of Man</title>, &amp;c.   He was also the compiler of an <title>Index to such English books printed before the year <datestruct value="1600"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>, as are in the Archiepiscopal Library at Lambeth</title>. 
   <P>The <num value="1">first</num> complete catalogue of printed books which was formed on the plan of the Bodleian Catalogue, was drawn up by Dr. Gibson (afterwards <pb id="P.433" n="433"> Bishop   of Lincoln), the editor of <QUOTE>Camden's Britannia,</QUOTE> who was some time vicar of Lambeth, and also librarian here. This catalogue is deposited in the manuscript library. In <datestruct value="1718--"><year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct> it was fairly copied by Dr. Wilkins, in <num value="3">three</num> folio volumes, and has been continued by his successors to the present time.   In <datestruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct>--<num value="4">4</num> the whole of the books and manuscripts underwent a complete repair, by a special grant from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. It may be added that the archbishop allows the library to be open to students, and, indeed, to all respectable persons, on application, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday during the year, vacations excepted. 
   <P>Before quitting the hall, we may remark that a stone on the building gives the date of the erection <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>; but a leaden pipe attached to the walls, running from the roof to the ground, to carry off rain-water, bears the date <datestruct value="1663"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct>. The pipe appears to be in a very good state of preservation; and a coat-of-arms, supposed to be that of Bishop Juxon, can be plainly observed on it. To account for the difference in date, it is supposed that the pipe belonged to an old building which stood on the site of the present structure. 
<FIGURE id="Fig.433" n="2000.14.0159"><HEAD>The Chamber In Lambeth   Palace In Which   The Lollards Were Confined.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
   <P>A   building of modern date, adjacent to the library, serves as the manuscript-room; it was put into thorough repair a few years ago, and rendered fire-proof.   Here are preserved some <num value="1300">1,300</num> manuscripts of the highest interest, together with the records of the palace, which are kept in patent <QUOTE>Reliance</QUOTE> safes.   Some of the documents date from   a very early time, and <num value="1">one</num> of them, it is alleged, bears the signature of Canute. 
   <P>Among the <QUOTE>curiosities</QUOTE> of Lambeth Palace preserved in the manuscript-room is the habit of a priest, consisting of a stole, manuple, chasuble, cord, <num value="2">two</num> bands marked P, and the corporal; also a crucifix of base metal, a string of beads, and a box of relics. Here also is kept the shell of a tortoise, believed to have lived in the palace gardens from   the time of Laud (<datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>) to <datestruct value="1753--"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct>, when it perished by the negligence of the gardener; the shell is <num value="10">ten</num> inches in length, and <num value="6">six</num> and a half inches in breadth. 
   <P>From the south-east corner of the hall a flight of stairs leads up to the Guard-chamber; it is a large state room, <num value="56">fifty-six</num> feet long by <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> feet wide, and is so called from having formerly contained the armour and arms appropriated to <pb id="P.434" n="434"> the defence of the palace. By whom   the arms kept for this purpose were originally purchased does not appear, but they seem to have regularly passed from   <num value="1">one</num> archbishop to another.   The author of <QUOTE>Select Views of London</QUOTE> says: <QUOTE>Archbishop Parker gave them to his successors, provided they were accepted in lieu of dilapidations. They were undoubtedly purchased by his successor, and so on; for Archbishop Laud says that he bought the arms at Lambeth of his predecessor's executors.   In the plundering of Lambeth House, in <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>, the arms--the quantity of which had been extremely exaggerated in order to increase the popular odium against Laud--were removed. They were, however, restored afterwards, or replaced with others; for some of the old muskets and bandoleers of an ancient make remained during Archbishop Potter's time in the burying-ground, the wall of which was pulled down by Archbishop Herring, and the arms disposed of elsewhere.</QUOTE> 
    <P><LEMMA id="lemma.434.1">The guard-chamber</LEMMA> is now used as a state diningroom. The principal feature which distinguishes the apartment at present is its venerable timber roof, which somewhat resembles that of the great hall, but is much less ornamented; the windows likewise are pointed, and of an ancient make.  Over the door of this chamber is the date <datestruct value="1681"><year reg="1681">1681</year></datestruct>, which shows that there were some reparations made to it in Archbishop Sancroft's time.   The lower part of the walls of the apartment is covered with oak wainscoting, above which are hung half-length portraits of many of the archbishops, the most interesting of which, perhaps, are those of Laud,  Cardinal Pole, Chicheley, Warham, and Arundel.  To the list of archiepiscopal portraits have been lately added those of Archbishops Sumner and  Longley; the latter, by Richmond, is hung in the drawing-room. A   portrait of Archbishop Laud, and also an etching of his trial in Westminster Hall, are to be found among the etchings of Hollar. 
   <P>Leaving this chamber, we pass on to the <LEMMA id="lemma.434.2">chapel</LEMMA>
through a narrow gallery, which contains numerous portraits of ecclesiastical dignitaries, a small portrait of Martin Luther on panel, and also a splendid engraving of Old London. Descending the stairs at the end of this gallery, we enter the vestibule of the chapel. This apartment is sometimes called the <QUOTE>post-room,</QUOTE> probably from   the fact of the ceiling being supported in the centre by a stout pillar. It is on record that the builder of this tower, Archbishop Chicheley, <QUOTE>found during his time the impossibility of punishing all heretics with death, therefore whipping and other severe and degrading punishments were consequently resorted to,</QUOTE> This so-called post-room has been by some considered as expressly set apart for that purpose; the pillar serving for the purpose of securing the unfortunate heretics, confined in the room above, while undergoing the degrading punishment of the lash. 
    <P>The chapel is considered by far the most ancient part of the palace, being probably part of Archbishop Boniface's original erection. It is in the earliest style of English pointed architecture, being lighted on the sides by triple lancet-shaped windows, and on the east by a window of <num value="5">five</num> lights, set between massive and deep masonry.   It consists of a body only, measuring <num value="72">seventy-two</num> feet in length, <num value="25">twenty-five</num> feet in breadth, and <num value="30">thirty</num> feet in height; but it is divided into <num value="2">two</num> parts by a handsome carved screen, which, curiously enough, is painted. Previous to the Civil Wars the windows were adorned with painted glass, put up by Archbishop Morton, representing the whole history of man from the creation to the day of judgment.  The windows being divided into <num value="3">three</num> parts, <QUOTE>the <num value="2">two</num> side lights contained the types of the Old  Testament, and the middle light the anti-type and verity of the New Testament.</QUOTE> Archbishop Laud, on taking possession of the palace--to use his own words-found these windows <QUOTE>shameful to look on, all diversly patched like a poor beggar's coat,</QUOTE> and he repaired them. <QUOTE>This laudable action of the prelate,</QUOTE> writes Dr. Ducarel, in his <QUOTE>History of  Lambeth,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>which would now be justly esteemed a mark of good taste and liberality, formed in that narrow age of Puritanical bigotry the subject of a criminal charge, it being alleged against him on his trial,  <Q>that he did repair the story of those windows by their like in the Mass Book;</Q>  but this he utterly denied, and affirmed that he and his secretary made out the story as well as they could by the remains that were unbroken.      These beautiful windows were all defaced by our outrageous reformers in the last century, who, under pretence of abhorring idols, made no scruple of committing sacrilege.</QUOTE> The roof of the chapel, which is flat and divided into compartments, is embellished with the arms of Archbishop Laud. 
   <P>The interior of the chapel is fitted up with a range of pews or stalls on each side for the officers of the archbishop's household, with seats beneath for the inferior domestics.   The altar-piece is of the Corinthian order, painted and gilded; and the floor is paved with black and white marble in lozenge-shaped slabs. 
   <P>The only interment that appears to have taken place here is that of Archbishop Parker, who died in <datestruct value="1575--"><year reg="1575">1575</year></datestruct>.   His body, by his request, was buried at the upper end of this chapel, against the <pb id="P.435" n="435"> communiontable, on the south side, under a monument of his own erecting, bearing a Latin inscription by his old friend, Dr. Walter Haddon.   The   spot where Parker's body now rests is marked by the following words cut in the pavement immediately before the communion rails:-- 
    <QUOTE REND=center lang=la><emph rend=caps>Corpus Matthaei Archiepiscopi Tandem Hic 
                          <LB>Quiescit.</emph></QUOTE>
In the western part of the chapel is a monument, with a long inscription to his memory, placed there by Archbishop Sancroft. 
   <P>During the Civil Wars, in <datestruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct>, when Lambeth Palace was possessed by Colonel Scott, the chapel was turned into a hall or dancing-room, and the ancient monument of Parker's was destroyed. Nor was this all. We are further told that his body, by order of Matthew Harding, a Puritan, was dug up, stripped of its leaden covering (which was sold), and buried in a dunghill, where it remained till after the Restoration, when Sir William Dugdale, hearing of the matter accidentally, immediately repaired to Archbishop Sancroft, by whose diligence, aided by the House of Lords, the bones were found, and again buried in the chapel, in the spot above indicated. 
   <P>Underneath the chapel is a spacious crypt, which probably dates from the middle of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century. It consists of a series of substantial stone arches, supported by short massive columns. The roof, which is about <num value="10">ten</num> feet from the ground, is finely groined. 
   <P>Retracing our steps through the <QUOTE>post-room,</QUOTE> we come to <num value="1">one</num> of the most interesting portions of Lambeth Palace, namely, the building called the 
<LEMMA id="lemma.435.1">Lollards' Tower</LEMMA>.   It was erected by Archbishop Chicheley, in the early part of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century, as a place of confinement for the unhappy heretics from whom it derives its name. The building is constructed chiefly of brick, and is embattled. Chicheley's arms are sculptured on the outer wall, on the Thames side; and beneath them is a Gothic niche, wherein at <num value="1">one</num> time stood the image of St. Thomas a Becket.   The prison in which the Lollards were confined is at the top of the tower, and is reached by a very narrow winding staircase. Its single doorway, which is so narrow as only to admit <num value="1">one</num> person at a time, is strongly barricaded by both <LEMMA id="lemma.435.2">an outer and an inner door of oak</LEMMA>, each <num value="3">three</num> inches and a half thick, and thickly studded with iron. The dimensions of <LEMMA id="lemma.435.3">the apartment within</LEMMA>
are <num value="12">twelve</num> feet in length by <num value="9">nine</num> in width, and <num value="8">eight</num> in height; and it is lighted by <num value="2">two</num> windows, which are only <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> inches high by <num value="14">fourteen</num> inches wide on the inside, and about half as high and half as wide on the outside. Both the walls and roof of the chamber are lined with oaken planks an inch and a half thick; and <num value="8">eight</num> large iron rings still remain fastened to the wood, the melancholy memorials of the victims who formerly pined in this dismal prison-house.   Many names and fragments of sentences are rudely cut out on various parts of the walls. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct> the Lollards' Tower, having fallen into a very dilapidated condition, was thoroughly repaired. The old roof was removed, the flooring renewed, the old side walls re-faced with new stone, every stone and brick ascertained to be faulty taken out and replaced with sound materials, and the whole structure restored.   The tower for many years was used as a lumber-room, but since its restoration it has been occupied by the Bishop of Lichfield as a town house. 
    <P>In addition to the apartments already mentioned, there are the <QUOTE>Presence Chamber,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Steward's  Parlour,</QUOTE> and the rooms in the new buildings which now serve as the residence of the archbishop. The  Presence Chamber is a fine ancient room, <num value="30">thirty</num> feet by <num value="19">nineteen</num>.   The precise time of the erection of this part of the palace is not known.

   <P>In this room   many causes relating to Merton and   All Souls' Colleges   at Oxford have been decided in presence of the Archbishops as Visitors. 
   <P>The present buildings, used as the archiepiscopal residence, owe much of their unity and stateliness to <LEMMA id="lemma.435.4">Archbishop Howley</LEMMA> (<datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>-<num value="48">48</num>), who not only rebuilt the principal palace front on the south, but restored much of the older portions.   The work was carried out under the direction of Mr. Blore; they were several years in progress, and the entire expense was little short of <measure value="60000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="60000">60,000</num></measure>.   The gardenfront of the palace is of Tudor character, and with its bays and enriched windows, battlements, gables, towers, and clustered chimney-shafts, is very picturesque. 
   <P>The gardens and grounds, together with the palace, cover about <num value="16">sixteen</num> acres of ground. <QUOTE>Here <pb id="P.436" n="436"> were formerly,</QUOTE> as John Timbs informs us in his <QUOTE>Curiosities of London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE><num value="2">two</num> fine white Marseilles fig-trees, traditionally planted by Cardinal Pole against that part of the palace which he founded: these trees,</QUOTE> he continues, <QUOTE>were more than <num value="50">fifty</num> feet in height and <num value="40">forty</num> in breadth, their circumference <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> and <num value="21">twenty-one</num> inches. They were removed during the late rebuilding, but some cuttings from the trees are growing between the buttresses of the library.</QUOTE> The terrace is named Clarendon Walk, from having been the scene of the conference between the great and wise Earl of Clarendon and the ill-fated Laud. It is with regret we add, that <QUOTE><LEMMA id="lemma.436.1">Bishops' Walk</LEMMA>,</QUOTE> with its pleasant elm-trees, trodden by the feet of so many visitors, both lay and clerical, was swept away to make room   for the Embankment in front of new St. Thomas's Hospital. 
    <P>There is extant <LEMMA id="lemma.436.2">a curious etching, by Hollar</LEMMA>, of the river-side at Lambeth, including Lambeth  Palace, or Lambeth <QUOTE>House,</QUOTE> as it was called.  In other respects it was in his time much the same as now, except that a grove of trees stands where now rises St. Thomas's Hospital. 
    <P>Of the <QUOTE>remarkable occurrences</QUOTE> which have taken place at the palace, space will only allow us to speak briefly. Archbishop Anselm ordained  Sampson, Bishop-elect of Worcester, both deacon and priest, together with the Bishop of Hereford, in <datestruct value="1096--"><year reg="1096">1096</year></datestruct>, at Lambeth. In <datestruct value="1097--"><year reg="1097">1097</year></datestruct>, he ordained Hugh,  Abbot of St. Austin, at Lambeth, in the chapel of the church of Rochester, where the archbishop then lodged.   He likewise presided in <datestruct value="1100--"><year reg="1100">1100</year></datestruct> at the council held at Lambeth which announced the legality of the intended marriage of Henry I. with  Matilda, the daughter of Malcolm, King of Scotland. 
   <P>Archbishops Ralph, Corboyl, Theobald, Richard, and Baldwin, were all consecrated at Lambeth; and though, as we have said, we have no account of Becket's being there, yet on the vacancy of the see of Canterbury by his death, the suffragan bishops, in pursuance of the order of Richard de Luci, assembled at that place, and, if not unanimously, they at least with <num value="1">one</num> voice, made choice of Roger, Abbot of Bec, to be his successor; but he would not accept the trust. 
   <P>From <QUOTE>Collins's Peerage</QUOTE> we learn how that, in <datestruct value="1345--"><year reg="1345">1345</year></datestruct>, the <num value="19">nineteenth</num> year of Edward III., John de Montfort, Duke of Brittany, did homage to the king in Lambeth Palace. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1367--"><year reg="1367">1367</year></datestruct> the consecration feast of <LEMMA id="lemma.436.3">William of Wykeham</LEMMA>, Bishop of Winchester, was kept here with great magnificence by Archbishop Langham. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1381--"><year reg="1381">1381</year></datestruct>, during the insurrection of Wat Tyler, the rebels not only beheaded Archbishop Sudbury, then Lord High Chancellor, but plundered this palace, and burnt most of the goods, books, and remembrances of Chancery.   Sudbury's Register  Book fortunately escaped destruction, and is still at Lambeth. The damages done by this lawless banditti were repaired in a great measure by  Arundel and Chicheley; but much was left for their successors to do, as may be reasonably concluded from   the sums of money expended by  Morton and Warham. 
    <P>In the account given of the convocation assembled by Archbishop Arundel in St. Paul's Cathedral, in June and <datestruct VALUE="1408-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1408">1408</year></datestruct>, it is related that after the session of <datestruct VALUE="-07-26"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=26>26</day></datestruct>, the bishops, abbots, priors, chancellors of the <num value="2">two</num> universities, doctors of divinity and laws, deans, archdeacons, <QUOTE>and other venerable persons eminent in every branch   of literature, to a number not easily to be computed,</QUOTE> were entertained with elegance, and with great profusion of viands, by the archbishop in his manor of Lambeth. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1446--"><year reg="1446">1446</year></datestruct> Archbishop Stafford held at Lambeth a convocation of all the prelates resident in London, to deliberate about the payment of a <num value="10">tenth</num> imposed by the Pope. The king's prohibition was offered as a plea for not agreeing to this demand. In <datestruct value="1481--"><year reg="1481">1481</year></datestruct> the bull of Pope Innocent IV. against the rebellious subjects of Henry VII. was exhibited to Archbishop  Morton <QUOTE>in a certain inner chamber within the 
 <hi rend=italics>manor</hi> of Lambeth.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In the year <datestruct value="1501"><year reg="1501">1501</year></datestruct>, Katharine of Arragon, afterwards Queen of Henry VIII., on her <num value="1">first</num> arrival in England, <QUOTE>was lodged with her ladies for some days at the archbishop's inne at Lambeth.</QUOTE> It was afterwards honoured with the frequent presence of royalty. In <datestruct value="1513--"><year reg="1513">1513</year></datestruct>, during a visit, it is presumed, from   Henry VIII. to Archbishop Warham at this palace, Charles Somerset was created   Earl of Worcester. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1533--"><year reg="1533">1533</year></datestruct>, Archbishop   Cranmer confirmed at Lambeth the marriage of Henry VIII. with Anne Boleyn; and <num value="3">three</num> years afterwards the same prelate, <QUOTE>being judicially seated in a certain low chapel within his house at Lambeth,</QUOTE> by a definitive sentence annulled the marriage between the sanme parties; the queen, in order to avoid the sentence of burning, having confessed to the archbishop some just and lawful impediments to her marriage with the king, A little before the latter eventnamely, on the <datestruct VALUE="1534-04-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct>-the commissioners sat at Lambeth to administer the oath of succession to the Crown, upon the heirs of the same Queen Anne, to the clergy, and chiefly those of London that had not yet sworn. On the same <pb id="P.437" n="437"> day were conveyed thither from the Tower Bishop Fisher and Sir Thomas More, the only layman at this meeting, to tender their oath to them; but both of them, as readers of history know, refused. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1537--"><year reg="1537">1537</year></datestruct>, the archbishops and bishops, by virtue of the royal commission, held various meetings at  Lambeth Palace, to devise the <QUOTE>Godly and Pious  Disposition of a Christian Man,</QUOTE> usually styled, from the composers of it, <QUOTE>The Bishops' Book,</QUOTE> but were obliged to separate on account of the plague then raging at Lambeth, and persons dying even at the palace gate. 
    <P>In the rout of the Scots army, in <datestruct value="1542--"><year reg="1542">1542</year></datestruct>, the Earl of Cassilis, who was <num value="1">one</num> of the many persons taken prisoners, was sent to Lambeth Palace, and was kept there on his parole. 
    <P>Several circumstances respecting Cardinal Pole are noticed as having happened here by Strype,  Burnet, and other authors. Queen Mary is said to have completely furnished Lambeth Palace for his reception at her own cost, and to have frequently honoured him with her company. <QUOTE>In <datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct>, on his arrival from the Continent, having presented himself at court, he went from thence in his barge to his palace at Lambeth; and here he soon afterwards summoned the bishops and inferior clergy, then assembled in convocation, to come to him to be absolved from all their prejudices, schisms, and heresies. The following month all the bishops went to Lambeth to receive the cardinal's blessing and directions.</QUOTE> 
    <P> <QUOTE>On the <datestruct VALUE="1556-07-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1556">1556</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> says Strype, <QUOTE>the queen removed from St. James's in the Fields into  Eltham, passing through the park to Whitehall, and took her barge, crossing over to Lambeth unto my lord cardinal's palace; and there she took her chariot, and so rid through St. George's Fields to  Newington, and so over the fields to Eltham, at <num value="5">five</num> o'clock in the afternoon. She was attended on horseback by the cardinal, &amp;c., and by a conflux of people to see her grace, above <num value="10000">ten thousand</num>.</QUOTE> In the winter of the same year the queen removed from St. James's through the park, and took her barge to Lambeth, where she visited Cardinal Pole.  After dinner she resumed her journey to Greenwich, where she kept her Christmas. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1558--"><year reg="1558">1558</year></datestruct> Cardinal Pole died at Lambeth Palace. His body lay in state <num value="40">forty</num> days, when it was removed to Canterbury Cathedral for interment. 
   <P>Queen Elizabeth was a frequent visitor here to Archbishop Parker; and the confidence she reposed in that prelate induced her to employ him in many affairs of great trust. On his <num value="1">first</num> promotion to the archiepiscopal see, she committed to him in free custody the deprived Bishops Tunstal and Thirlby, Bishops of Durham   and Ely respectively, whom, we are told, he entertained most kindly.   Tunstal survived his confinement only about <num value="4">four</num> months, and was buried in Lambeth Church; Thirlby, however, continued to be the archbishop's <QUOTE>guest</QUOTE> for upwards of <num value="10">ten</num> years, and was buried near his brother bishop. 
    <P>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion when Queen Elizabeth visited  Archbishop Parker-possibly during <num value="1">one</num> of her <QUOTE>progresses</QUOTE> --the following circumstance is said to have occurred:--The queen was never reconciled to that part of the Reformation which allowed the marriage of ecclesiastics; and, unfortunately,  Parker had not only written a treatise on the lawfulness of marriage, but had absolutely entered into the holy state prior to the repeal of the statute forbidding celibacy. The haughty Elizabeth, although elegantly entertained by the archbishop and his lady for several days, could not at her departure refrain from venting her resentment in the following rude manner. Addressing herself to Mrs. Parker, by way of taking leave, she said: <QUOTE><hi rend=italics>Madam</hi>, I may not call you; <hi rend=italics>mistress</hi>, I am   ashamed to call you; yet though I know not what to call you, I thank you.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1571--"><year reg="1571">1571</year></datestruct>, we read, the queen <QUOTE>took an airing in  St. George's Fields,</QUOTE> previous to which she had an interview with the archbishop at Lambeth Bridge.  It appears, according to Strype's <QUOTE>Life of Parker,</QUOTE> that the prelate had in some degree, about this time, fallen under the queen's displeasure by speaking freely to her concerning his office. The archbishop relates this incident in a letter to Lady  Bacon :-- <QUOTE>I will not,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE>be abashed to say to my prince that I think in conscience in answering to my charging. As this other day I was well chidden at my prince's hand; but with <num value="1">one</num> ear I heard her hard words, and with the other, and in my conscience and heart, I heard God. And yet, her highness being never so much incensed to be offended with me, the next day coming on  Lambeth Bridge into the fields, she gave me her very good looks, and spake secretly in mine ear, that she must needs continue mine authority before the people to the credit of my service.   Whereat, divers of my <hi rend=italics>arches</hi> then being with me peradventure mervailed; where peradventure somebody would have looked over the shoulders, and slily slipt away, to have abashed me before the world.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Grindall, Parker's successor in the archbishopric, soon fell under the queen's displeasure, and it does not appear that she ever honoured him with a visit. Archbishop Whitgift, however, seems to have been more fortunate, for it is reported that Elizabeth was entertained by him no less than <num value="15">fifteen</num> different <pb id="P.438" n="438"> times, and that she frequently stayed here for <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> days together.   James I. was likewise an occasional visitor of Whitgift; and the last occasion was on the <datestruct VALUE="1604-02-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1604">1604</year></datestruct>, when the prelate lay on his death-bed. It was during the primacy of Whitgift that an important event occurred at Lambeth Palace which has linked its history more closely than anything else with that of the Established Church. This was none other than the Conference where the famous <QUOTE>Lambeth Articles</QUOTE> were propounded for the signature of the clergy. Macaulay mentions these articles thus:-- <QUOTE>A class of questions, as to which the founders of the Anglican Church and the <num value="1">first</num> generation of Puritans had diffeled little or not at all, now

 began to furnish matter for fierce disputes. The controversies which had divided the Protestant body in its infancy had related almost exclusively to Church government and to ceremonies. There had been no serious quarrel between the contending parties on points of metaphysical theology. The doctrines held by the chiefs of the party touching original sin, faith, grace, predestination and election, were those which are popularly called Calvinistic. Towards the close of Elizabeth's reign, her favourite prelate, Archbishop Whitgift, in concert with the Bishop of London and other theologians, drew up the celebrated instrument known by the name of the  <Q>Lambeth Articles.</Q>    In that instrument the most startling   of the Calvinistic   doctrines are

 <pb id="P.440" n="440"> affirmed with a distinctness which would shock many who, in our age, are reputed Calvinists. <num value="1">One</num> clergyman, who took the opposite side and spoke harshly of Calvin, was arraigned for his presumption by the University of Cambridge, and escaped punishment only by expressing his firm belief in the tenets of reprobation and final perseverance, and his sorrow for the offence which he had given to pious men by reflecting on the great French Reformer.</QUOTE> The precious document itself, which is thus connected in name with Lambeth, may be read <hi rend=italics>in extenso</hi> in Southey's or any other <QUOTE>History of the English Church,</QUOTE> and so we may be spared the necessity of quoting it here; we may, however, merely add that the <QUOTE>Lambeth Articles</QUOTE> were <num value="9">nine</num> in number, and ultra-Calvinistic in their character.   They were drawn up by Dr. Whitaker, Master of St. John's College, Cambridge, and   Regius Professor of Divinity in that University, at the request of Archbishop Whitgift, who sought to impose them on the clergy of the Established Church. They were rigidly suppressed, however, by order of Queen Elizabeth; and so strictly were her injunctions executed, that for many years a printed copy of them was not to be obtained <QUOTE>for love or money.</QUOTE> They were brought forward, some <num value="10">ten</num> years later, at the Hampton Court Conference, but only to be rejected. The Irish Protestant Church, however, adopted them in <datestruct value="1615--"><year reg="1615">1615</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>Archbishop Abbot, who was appointed to the see of Canterbury in <datestruct value="1611--"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>, was accused by the Duke of Buckingham of living at too costly a rate for an archbishop, and of entertaining people who were not well affected to the king and his court. On this occasion he replied to Secretary Conway: <QUOTE>When King James gave me the archbishopric, he charged me that I should carry my house nobly, and live like an archbishop, which I promised him that I would do; and all that came to my house of the civil sort I gave them friendly entertainment, not sifting what exceptions the duke made against them     . ...

    <P>Although the dinners in the great hall have ceased to take place, and the fragments, therefore, are no longer given to the poor as of old, a substitute for the latter custom is still in practice, in the shape of the archbishop's bounty or <QUOTE>dole,</QUOTE> which has been dispensed before the principal entrance of the palace every week down to the present time: it consists of money, bread, and provisions, which are given to <num value="30">thirty</num> poor parishioners of Lambeth, <num value="10">ten</num> receiving it in turn on different days. 
    <P>Going back again to the early part of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, we must speak of <LEMMA id="lemma.441.1">Laud</LEMMA>, who was translated to the archbishopric from the see of  London on the death of Abbot in <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>. This prelate unfortunately lived in troublous times; and  Evelyn records, in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date <datestruct VALUE="1641-04-27"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=27>27</day>,  <year reg=1641>1641</year></datestruct>--apparently as an eye-witness--the fact of <QUOTE>the Bishop of Canterbury's palace at Lambeth being assaulted by a rude rabble from Southwark.</QUOTE> A few days later the palace was again attacked by a London mob. As we learn from   the <QUOTE>Comprehensive History of England,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Laud's friend,  Pierce, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, had called the Scottish war of <datestruct value="1640--"><year reg="1640">1640</year></datestruct>-<num value="41">41</num>  <Q>bellum Episcopale</Q>   (a war for Episcopacy), and such the English people were disposed to consider it. During the sitting of the convocation, a libel or paper was posted up at the Royal Exchange, inviting the London apprentices, who were rather prone to mischief, to rise and sack the archiepiscopal palace of Lambeth.  The invitation was accepted, and on the night of the <datestruct VALUE="-05-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, a mob, consisting almost entirely of apprentices and youths, fell upon the said palace.  But Laud had had time to fortify and garrison his residence; the rioters were not very numerous, and he  <Q>had no   harm.</Q>    Laud, in noting the occurrence in his  <Q>Diary,</Q>  says :  <Q> May   i.

Clarendon says that <QUOTE>this infamous, scandalous, headless insurrection, quashed with the deserved death of that <num value="1">one</num> varlet, was not thought to be contrived or fomented by any persons of quality.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In their accusations against Archbishop Laud, the Puritan House of Commons charged him with setting up and repairing Popish images and pictures in the window of his chapel in Lambeth Palace. The archbishop, in his defence, urged that the Homilies of the Reformed and Established Church allowed the historical use of images, and that Calvin himself permitted them   in that sense; and that the Primitive Christians approved of, and had in their houses, pictures of Christ himself. 
   <P>Laud was beheaded by the Parliamentarians in <datestruct VALUE="1644-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1644">1644</year></datestruct>, and his body was interred in the church of Allhallows, Barking, near Tower Hill. After this event the see of Canterbury was vacant nearly <num value="17">seventeen</num> years, during which period, as we have shown above, Lambeth Palace was nearly demolished.

    <P>Queen Mary II. paid a visit here to Archbishop Tillotson in <datestruct value="1694--"><year reg="1694">1694</year></datestruct>, as appears from an entry in the churchwardens' accounts of <QUOTE><measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure> paid to the ringers</QUOTE> on that occasion. This was only a few weeks before the archbishop's death. In the preceding   year the archbishop had   called an assembly of the bishops at Lambeth Palace, when they agreed to several regulations, which were at <num value="1">first</num> designed to be enforced by their own authority; but upon more mature consideration it was judged requisite that they should appear under that of their Majesties in the form of royal injunctions. The queen was at different times consulted by the archbishop concerning this business, and it is not unlikely that it was the subject of their conversation on the occasion of the visit above mentioned. 
   <P>Both of Dr. Tillotson's successors, Archbishops Tenison and Wake, lived and died here, and the former was buried in the parish church close by the palace.   Dr. Wake was the author of <QUOTE>The Church of England and its Convocations,</QUOTE> and <pb id="P.442" n="442"> several other theological works; he was celebrated especially for his controversy with Bossuet, and his project of union between the English and Gallican Churches. 
   <P>Hutton, Secker, Cornwallis, and Moore, who were archbishops successively from <datestruct value="1757--"><year reg="1757">1757</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, likewise ended their days here, and were all buried in Lambeth Church. 
   <P>The palace very narrowly escaped destruction during the Gordon Riots in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>. The <num value="1">first</num> alarm was given on Tuesday, <datestruct VALUE="-06-6"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=6>6th</day></datestruct>, when a party, to the number of <num value="500">500</num> or more, who had previously assembled in St. George's Fields, came to the palace with drums and fifes, and colours flying, crying, <QUOTE>No Popery!</QUOTE> Finding the gates shut, after knocking several times without obtaining any answer, they called out that they should return in the evening, and paraded round the palace all that day.   Upon this alarm, it was thought necessary to apply to the Secretary at War for a party of soldiers for the security of the palace; accordingly, a party of the Guards, to the amount of <num value="100">one hundred</num> men, commanded by Colonel Deacon, arrived about <num value="2">two</num> o'clock that afternoon, when sentinels were immediately placed upon the towers of the palace and at every convenient avenue. The mob still paraded round the house, and continued so to do for several days, notwithstanding the number of the soldiers. In this alarming situation, Archbishop Cornwallis, with his wife and family, were with great difficulty prevailed upon to quit the palace, whither they did not return till the disturbances were entirely ended.   The military remained at Lambeth for upwards of <num value="2">two</num> months, during which period there were from <num value="200">200</num> to <num value="300">300</num> men quartered in the palace. 
   <P>A good story is told of Archbishop Manners- Sutton (<datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>-<num value="28">28</num>) by the Honourable Miss Amelia Murray, in her <QUOTE>Recollections.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>It happened once that Lord Eldon and the Archbishop dined with the King (George III.), and the former became rather communicative and merry over his port. At last he said,  <Q> It is a curious fact, sir, that your Majesty's Archbishop and your Lord Chancellor both married their wives clandestinely!   I had some excuse, certainly, for Bessie Surtees was the prettiest girl in all Newcastle; but Mrs. Sutton was always the same pumpkin-faced thing that she is at present.</Q>  The king was much amused;</QUOTE> as, indeed, he well might be. 
    <P>Coming down to more recent times, we find Lambeth Palace used for the holding of meetings of prelates of the Reformed Anglican Church at home and in the colonies.   The <num value="1">first</num> of these meetings-called the Pan-Anglican Synod-was held here, under Archbishop Longley, in the autumn of <datestruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct>.   It was attended by upwards of <num value="70">seventy</num> bishops, from England, Ireland, the colonies, and America; but beyond the issuing of an address, couched in very general terms, nothing definite seems to have resulted from this great ecclesiastical gathering. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct> the great hall, or public library, was used as the Arches Court of Canterbury, for the trial of cases brought before the Dean of the Court of Arches under the <QUOTE>Public Worship Regulation  Act.</QUOTE> The west end of the apartment was fitted up as a court for the accommodation of the bar, the reporters, witnesses, &amp;c., and the east end was barriered off for the general public. The judge,  Lord Penzance, occupied the archbishop's chair.  The <num value="1">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> cases tried here were those of the  Rev. Charles J. Ridsdale, of St. Peter's, Folkestone, and the Rev. Arthur Tooth, vicar of St. James's,  Hatcham, for ritualistic proceedings in their respective churches. 
    <P>There are still <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> items of interest concerning Lambeth Palace which we must not omit to mention. Here, for instance, every year during the month   of December, the officials of the  Stationers' Company still wait formally upon the archbishop in order to present him with copies of certain almanacks which they have the privilege of publishing, and which were formerly not allowed to be issued except with the sanction of the Established  Church.   The officials and their servants were in former times entertained by the archbishop, on the occasion of these visits, with a copious supply of cakes and ale. This curious custom had a somewhat singular origin, which is now not generally known, or, more probably, is now <QUOTE>generally forgotten,</QUOTE> though recorded by Sylvanus Urban in the 
 <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi> for <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct> :-- <QUOTE>On the annual aquatic procession of the Lord Mayor of London to Westminster, the barge of the Company of  Stationers, which is usually the <num value="1">first</num> in the show, proceeds to Lambeth Palace, where from   time immemorial they (the Stationers) receive a present of <num value="16">sixteen</num> bottles of the archbishop's prime wine.  This custom originated at the beginning of the last century. When Archbishop Tenison enjoyed the see, a very near relative of his, who happened to be Master of the Stationers' Company, thought it a compliment to call there in full state and in his barge, when the archbishop, being informed that the number of the company on the barge was <num value="32">thirty-two</num>, thought that a pint of wine for each would not be disagreeable, and ordered, at the same time, bread and cheese and ale to be given to the watermen and attendants; from this <pb id="P.443" n="443"> accidental circumstance it has grown into a settled custom. The Company, in return, present to the archbishop a copy of the several almanacks which they have the privilege of publishing.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Of course, since aquatic processions on the Thames have been discontinued, the barge of the Stationers' Company no longer performs the journey to Lambeth Palace; but the present of the almanacks is still made to the archbishop, although somewhat nearer the end of the year; the honorarium of <QUOTE>cakes and ale</QUOTE> for the bearer, however, seems to be forgotten. 
   <P>The Archbishops of Canterbury used formerly to keep their own barge, in which they crossed the Thames to the House of Lords or to Whitehall Palace. Their favourite landing-place on the opposite side of the water was Whitehall Stairs, the picturesque gateway of which, represented on page <num value="444">444</num>, was standing till the present century. 
    <P>Degrees are occasionally conferred at Lambeth on individuals who have risen to eminence among the English clergy, though they have not graduated in early life at <num value="1">one</num> of the great universities. They are, however, a legacy from times anterior to the  Reformation, when the Archbishop of Canterbury had the recognised right of conferring them, as being the permanent legate for the Pope of Rome.  The privilege was specially confirmed to the see of  Canterbury by that self-elected Pope, Henry VIII., in <datestruct VALUE="1534-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct>, and it is still occasionally exercised by the archbishop. 
    <P>The parish church of <LEMMA id="lemma.443.1">St. Mary, Lambeth</LEMMA>, is situate near the water-side, and adjoins the palace.  The whole of the building, with the exception of the tower, was pulled down and rebuilt in <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>. <QUOTE>Sufficient of the original fabric of the church,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Tanswell, in his <QUOTE>History of Lambeth,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>has been preserved to enable us to assign the latter end of the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century as the date of its foundation. The later character of the details of the chapels on the north and south sides of the chancel lead to the conclusion that the church, when <num value="1">first</num> erected, consisted of a nave, chancel, and tower only, and that these chapels, which are the property of the Howard and Leigh families respectively, were added at: a subsequent period.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Mr. W. Newton, the author of <QUOTE>London in the Olden Time,</QUOTE> says that the antiquity of the existing church is not known, and that it was <QUOTE>originally a Gothic structure, a portion of which is supposed to date from about the end of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century.</QUOTE> This, however, is scarcely the case, for in the Bishops' Registers at Winchester is a commission against such of the inhabitants of Lambeth as refuse to contribute to the rebuilding and repairs of the church, dated <datestruct value="1374--"><year reg="1374">1374</year></datestruct>. <num value="3">Three</num> years afterwards there was another commission to compel the inhabitants to build a tower for their church, <QUOTE>then newly built,</QUOTE> and to furnish it with bells. Mr. Newton adds: <QUOTE>The building has been much altered from its original state, and is now (<datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>) rather a heterogeneous combination   of various styles of architecture, likely to afford but little interest to the architectural student.</QUOTE> From this statement, however, we venture to disagree. 
   <P>In <datestruct VALUE="1851-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>, the work of restoration was commenced, according to the plans and under the direction of Mr. Philip Hardwick, and it was completed in little more than a year. Care was taken that the outline of the original foundations should be preserved, and that, wherever possible, the ancient detail should be reproduced.   The church, as it now appears, consists of a nave, north and south aisles, and porch, chancel, and chapels; the fine western tower remaining without alteration. The arcades in the nave have been carefully restored, and the walling above them   has been carried up to the original height and pierced with clerestory lights, the whole being surmounted by an open timber roof, divided into <num value="7">seven</num> bays by arched trusses, resting   on   the ancient corbels.   The chancel is divided from the nave, and the Howard and Leigh Chapels from   the chancel, by <num value="3">three</num> lofty arches. The large east window, of <num value="5">five</num> lights, with the upper part filled with foliated tracery, is furnished with stained glass, and is inscribed to the memory of Archbishop Howley.   The west end of the church is lighted by a large circular window filled with geometrical tracery, and the organ is placed immediately beneath it. There are extensive galleries on both sides of the church, and also at the west end. The flooring is closely and uniformly paved, and most of the walls are wainscoted. 
    <P>In the old building, on the wall over the entrance to the chancel, were placed the royal arms as borne by Queen Anne, with the figures of Fame and Devotion, the <num value="1">one</num> sounding a trumpet and the other holding a flaming heart.   These were afterwards placed at the west end of the north gallery. At the restoration of the church, the old altar-piece, which displayed a painting of Moses and Aaron supporting the tables of the Law, was removed, and is now placed against the wall of the north gallery. The present altar-piece is of carved oak, enriched with gilding and arabesque painting. 
   <P>The east end of the old north aisle was called Howard's Chapel, from its having been built, in <datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>, by Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk (many of whose family are here interred); and that of the <pb id="P.444" n="444"> south aisle, Leigh's Chapel, built in the same year by Sir John Leigh (son of Ralph Leigh, lord of the manor of Stockwell), who, with his lady, lies buried here. At the bottom of the middle compartment of the south-east window, painted on a pane twentyfour inches by <num value="16">sixteen</num>, was the picture of the pedlar and his dog, of which we have spoken in a previous chapter.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="388">388</num>.</NOTE>   At what time this memorial was <num value="1">first</num> put up there is no mention, but such a portrait certainly existed in <datestruct value="1608--"><year reg="1608">1608</year></datestruct>, there being in the churchwardens' accounts of that year an entry of <QUOTE><measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure>, paid to the glazier for a panel of glass for the window   where the picture of the

<P>The churchwardens' books contain some in teresting and curious items concerning the old church.   It appears that it contained, in   pre Reformation times, no less than <num value="5">five</num> altars: they were dedicated respectively to the Blessed Virgin to St. Thomas, to St. George, to St. Nicholas, and to St. Christopher.   Then there are the <QUOTE>accounts of Wardens of the Brethren of Sent Crystover, kep within the church of Lambeth in the time of <pb id="P.445" n="445"> Henry VIII.,</QUOTE> from   which it appears that the stipend paid to Sir William Webster, the priest, <QUOTE>for <num value="1">one</num> year and <num value="1">one</num> quarter,</QUOTE> amounted to the sum of <measure value="8l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="8">8</num></measure> <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure>   In the reign of Queen Mary is a charge for replacing an altar in the Norfolk Chapel, on the revival of the old religion: <QUOTE><datestruct value="1557--"><year reg="1557">1557</year></datestruct>.

   <P>The ancient pulpit must have been a curiosity in its way; for by the above-mentioned accounts it appears that in <datestruct value="1522--"><year reg="1522">1522</year></datestruct> a new pulpit was erected in this church, at a cost of <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure>, and the old <num value="1">one</num> was valued at <hi rend=italics>eightpence</hi> only.

It was placed against the south-east pillar of the nave, and was furnished, after the Puritan fashion of that time, with a hour-glass, of which, however, there are no remains, though it is mentioned twice in the churchwardens' accounts.   The pulpit and reading-desk were subsequently removed to another <pb id="P.446" n="446"> position at the entrance from the chancel to the nave. 
    <P>The parish registers begin with the year <datestruct value="1539"><year reg="1539">1539</year></datestruct>. In the churchwardens' accounts are the following entries respecting them:--

   <P>Lambeth has numbered among its rectors many men who have risen to eminence, of whom   we may mention Dr. Hooper, afterwards Bishop of St. Asaph, and subsequently Bishop of Bath and Wells: he was the author of several works in defence of the Church of England. Dr. Gibson, the editor of <QUOTE>Camden's Britannia,</QUOTE> and author of the <QUOTE>Codex Juris Ecclesiastici;</QUOTE> he resigned the rectory on being raised to the bishopric of Lichfield. Dr. B. Porteus, afterwards Bishop, in succession, of Chester and   of London.     His successor, Dr. Vyse, rector of the parish during the latter part of the last century, was the son of a clergyman at Lichfield, the contemporary and friend of Dr. Johnson.   To him   Dr. Johnson addressed <num value="2">two</num> letters, printed in <QUOTE>Boswell,</QUOTE> soliciting him to ask the Archbishop of Canterbury to present to the Charterhouse Hospital a nephew of the learned Grotius. 
   <P>The church contains some interesting monuments, including those to the memory of several of the archbishops, but they were, of course, shifted from   the positions which they originally occupied when the rebuilding of the fabric took place in the year <datestruct value="1851"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>Here repose the bones of the brave old primate Bancroft, of the meek Secker, and of the learned Tenison, who successively sat in the archiepiscopal chair. Archbishops Cornwallis and Hutton, too, are likewise interred here, as also are Bishops Thirlby and TunstalL   The body of Thirlby was accidentally discovered when Archbishop Cornwallis was buried in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>.   The body, which was wrapped in fine linen, was moist, and had evidently been preserved in some species of pickle, which still retained a volatile smell, not unlike that of hartshorn; the face was perfect, and the limbs flexible; the beard of a remarkable length, and beautifully white.   The linen and woollen garments were all well preserved. The cap, which was of silk, adorned with point lace, was in fashion like that represented in the pictures of Archbishop Juxon. A slouched hat, with strings fastened to it, was under the left arm.   There was also a cassock, so fastened as to appear like an apron with strings, and several small pieces of the bishop's garments, which had the appearance of a pilgrim's habit. 
    <P>Besides the above-mentioned, here, or in the churchyard, rest the bodies of Dollond, the noted maker of telescopes, and founder of the well-known firm   in St. Paul's Churchyard; Madame Storace, the vocalist; and Moore, the author of the tragedy of the <QUOTE>Gamester.</QUOTE> Here, too, sleep in peace  Ashmole, the antiquary, and the Tradescants, whose united collections of natural history formed the nucleus of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford.

 In <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, a table monument of free-stone was erected here by the widow of John Tradescant the younger, covered on each of its <num value="4">four</num> sides with sculptures: at each corner is the representation of a large tree, seeming to support the slab; at <num value="1">one</num> end is a hydra picking at a bare skull; on the other are the arms of the family. On <num value="1">one</num> side of the tomb are ruins,  Grecian pillars and capitals, an obelisk and pyramid; and on the opposite a crocodile, shells, &amp;c., and a view of some Egyptian buildings.

Strickland draws a touching picture of the scene. <QUOTE>On that spot, which has been rendered a site of historic interest by this affecting incident, the beautiful and unfortunate consort of the last of our Stuart kings remained sitting, with her infant son fondly clasped to her bosom   . . Mary Beatrice looked back with streaming eyes towards the royal home where her beloved consort remained, lonely and surrounded with perils, and vainly endeavoured to trace out the lights of Whitehall among those that were reflected from   the opposite shore along the dark rolling river.</QUOTE> It is a satisfaction to know that her patience was rewarded, and that she and her child made their escape to France from this country.

<P>We are now on gossiping ground, and therefore we can scarcely be severely blamed if we dwell for a short space on the stories of past times.   Quitting the precincts of Lambeth Palace, and following the course of the river for a short distance northward, we arrive at Vauxhall Bridge Road; and then, after passing under the South-Western Railway, we reach the spot where, till about <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, stood the grand entrance to <LEMMA id="lemma.448.1">Vauxhall Gardens</LEMMA>-that paradise of enchantment, with its houris in the illuminated walks, and the lamps and the fireworks, and the water-works, and the hermit in his cave, and the Rotunda, and Madame Saqui on the tightrope, and fowl and ham and rack punch in the boxes, and poke bonnets, and scanty skirts, and roll collars, and swallow-tailed coats;--all these have passed away, and left not a vestige behind. Times have indeed changed. If there were now a Prince Regent and a batch of Allied Sovereigns, and a Duke of Wellington and a Field-Marshal Blucher, they would not go to Cremorne to show themselves to the people; and yet, in the great days of Vauxhall, those renowned personages did pay the gardens an evening visit, and were duly and right loyally <pb id="P.448" n="448"> cheered and mobbed by the crowd who had paid for admission. When such great persons were not present, there were songstresses by the score-Mrs. Bland, the sweet-voiced, dumpy little ballad singer; and Dignum the mellifluous; and Madame Vestris; and sometimes, if we mistake not, the queenly Kitty Stephens and glorious Incledon. But we are anticipating the order of events, and must return to plain historical details. 
   <P>The <num value="1">first</num> authentic notice of these gardens occurs in a record of the Duchy of Cornwall, dated in <datestruct value="1615--"><year reg="1615">1615</year></datestruct>, at which time the property was vested in Jane, widow of John Vaux, <num value="1">one</num> of whose daughters subsequently married Barlow, Bishop of Lincoln. The residence belonging to the estate was then called Stock-dens, or Stoc-dens, and the grounds about it were known as <QUOTE>The Spring Gardens,</QUOTE> a name which they retained in theory and in official documents to the very last, though popularly known as <QUOTE>Vauxhall Gardens.</QUOTE> The exact date at which these grounds were <num value="1">first</num> opened to the public is now involved in obscurity. Wycherley, about the year <datestruct value="1677"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>, speaks of taking <QUOTE>a syllabub at the New Spring Garden.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The place, however, is mentioned by John Evelyn in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date <datestruct VALUE="1661-07-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>, as <QUOTE>the new Spring Garden at Lambeth, a prettycontrived   plantation.</QUOTE> <num value="2">Two</num> years later it is described as being laid out in squares <QUOTE>enclosed with hedges of gooseberries, within which are roses, beans, and asparagus ;</QUOTE> from   which it may be inferred that in the early part of the reign of Charles II. these gardens were practically useful, and not a mere resort of pleasure-seekers. 
   <P>Manning and Bray, the historians of Surrey, ascribe the origin of the gardens to the ingenious Sir Samuel Morland, who certainly had a mansion in this neighbourhood in <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>. Evelyn, in <datestruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></datestruct>, mentions a visit which he paid to Sir Samuel here <QUOTE>to see his house and mechanics.</QUOTE> A foot-note is added, stating that in his house here Sir Samuel had built and fitted up a large room, which he had furnished in a sumptuous manner, for concerts and other gatherings, on the top of which was a <QUOTE>punchinello holding a sun-dial.</QUOTE> He had constructed also some fountains in his gardens. He was much in favour with the king for services he had rendered to him while abroad; and his house bore the reputation of being the place across the water to which the <QUOTE>merry monarch</QUOTE> and his gay ladies would often repair on fine evenings. 
    <P>Notwithstanding that when <num value="1">first</num> opened, these gardens were commonly called <QUOTE>The New Spring Garden at Lambeth,</QUOTE> so far as we know, they bear no trace of a <QUOTE>water spring,</QUOTE> or <hi rend=italics>jet d&lsquo;eau</hi>, such as we have described in our account of the Spring Gardens at Charing Cross.<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="77">77</num>.</NOTE>   The idea of the place being borrowed, however, from   the gardens at Charing Cross, it would seem that a similar name was given to it, though meaningless. 
   <P>Samuel Pepys, in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date <datestruct VALUE="1667-05-28"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1667>1667</year></datestruct>, mentions these gardens in the following terms :-- <QUOTE>Went by water to Fox <hi rend=italics>(sic</hi>) Hall, and there walked in Spring Gardens. A great deal of company; the weather and gardens pleasant, and cheap going thither: for a man may go to spend what he will, or nothing at all: all is <num value="1">one</num>. But to hear the nightingale and other birds, and here fiddles and there a harp, and here a Jew's harp, and there laughing, and there [to see] fine people walking, is very diverting.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In the space at our disposal it would be impossible to quote half the passages to be found in our modern classical writers which refer to these gardens in their hey-day of fashion. That they existed as a place of public amusement soon after Evelyn made the above-mentioned entry in his <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> is clear from the <hi rend=italics>Spectator</hi>, No. <num value="383">383</num>, dated <datestruct VALUE="1712-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1712">1712</year></datestruct>.   Readers of that delightful work will not readily forget Addison's account of Sir Roger de Coverley's visit with him   to Vauxhall; how he <QUOTE>took boat</QUOTE> at the Temple Stairs, and was rowed thither by a waterman with only <num value="1">one</num> leg; how sadly, on his way up the Thames, he contrasted the many spires of the City churches with the scantiness of such edifices westward of Temple Bar, and what badinage he had to put up with from the other Thames watermen <hi rend=italics>en route</hi> for his destination. They will not forget his description of the place: -- <QUOTE>The Spring Gardens are exquisitely pleasant at this time of the year.   When I considered the fragrancy of the walks and bowers, with the choirs of birds that sang upon the trees, and the tribe of people that walked under their shade, I could not but look upon the place as a kind of Mahometan paradise;</QUOTE> nor will they forget how the gardens put Sir Roger in mind of a little coppice by his house in the country, which his chaplain used to call <QUOTE>an aviary of nightingales.</QUOTE> And they will also call to mind how the worthy knight and his companion concluded their walk with a modest glass of Burton ale and a slice of hung beef, the fragments of which he ordered the waiter to carry to the waterman that had but <num value="1">one</num> leg. 
   <P>Such is our earliest notice of Vauxhall as a public garden, written, most probably, not long after its opening. The name of the place was originally <pb id="P.449" n="449"> Faux Hall, which in process of time has become corrupted into the better known appellation of Vauxhall.   In the days of King John, Fulk, or Faulk de Brent, a stout Norman knight, held a manor on this spot; and the house was afterwards known as Copped, or Copt Hall.   It is so called in Norden's <QUOTE>Survey</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1615--"><year reg="1615">1615</year></datestruct>), where a residence is described as being <QUOTE>opposite to a capital mansion called Fauxe Hall.</QUOTE> The latter, Lysons imagines, was the ancient <LEMMA id="lemma.449.1">manor-house</LEMMA>, which, being afterwards pulled down or otherwise lost, the name was transferred to Copt Hall. This house was the residence of Sir Thomas Parry, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and was held by him of the Manor of Kennington.   Here the ill-fated Arabella Stuart, whose misfortune it was to be too nearly allied to the Crown, remained prisoner for <num value="12">twelve</num> months, under the custody of Sir Thomas.<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="404">404</num>.</NOTE>
In the Parliamentary Survey taken after the execution of Charles I., the mansion is described as <QUOTE>a capital messuage called Vauxhall, alias Copped Hall, bounded by the Thames: being a fair dwelling-house, strongly built, of <num value="3">three</num> storeys high, and a fair staircase breaking out from it of <num value="19">nineteen</num> feet square.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century it is asserted that the place belonged to the family of Fauxe, or Vaux.  The name of Thomas, the <num value="2">second</num> son of Lord  Vaux (<datestruct value="1520--"><year reg="1520">1520</year></datestruct>-<num value="60">60</num>), is not unknown as a poet; he is mentioned in Johnson's <QUOTE>Lives of the Poets ;</QUOTE> but whether he ever lived here we have no authority for deciding. Pennant, with more rashness than is his wont, considers that <QUOTE>Vauxhall</QUOTE> was a corruption of <QUOTE>Faux Hall,</QUOTE> and that it was called after the celebrated Guy Fawkes, of gunpowderplot celebrity, who lived here, and, as Dr. Ducarel imagined, owned the manor.   Following up this mistaken idea in all the simplicity of good faith,  Pennant adds, with a touch of bitterness, <QUOTE>In foreign parts a <hi rend=italics>colonne infame</hi> would have been erected on the spot; but the site is now (<datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>) occupied by  Marble Hall and Cumberland Tea Gardens, and several other buildings.</QUOTE> Mention is made of the place by Pepys in <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct>, when he tells us how that, on his return from Epsom to London, he and his companion <QUOTE>set up</QUOTE> their horses at <QUOTE>Fox Hall,</QUOTE> and   returned   home by water from   Lambeth  Stairs. 
   <P>There does not appear to be any foundation for the tradition that the renowned Guy had anything to do with Faux Hall; but the story received some support from the fact that the gunpowder conspirators had a house in Lambeth where they stored their powder, as we have stated in a former chapter.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="425">425</num>.</NOTE>

    <P>The mansion was sold in <datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>, but subsequently reverted to the Crown at the Restoration. After passing through various hands, in the year <datestruct value="1675"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>  Sir Samuel Morland obtained a lease of Vauxhall  House, as it was then called, made it his residence, and considerably improved the premises. 
    <P>Aubrey, in his <QUOTE>Antiquities of Surrey,</QUOTE> informs us that Sir Samuel Morland <QUOTE>built a fine room at  Vauxhall, the inside all of looking-glass, and fountains very pleasant to behold; which,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>is much visited by strangers.   It stands in the middle of the garden, covered with Cornish slate, on the point whereof he placed a punchinello, verywell carved, which held a dial, but the winds have demolished it.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The house,</QUOTE> says a more modern author, Sir John Hawkins, <QUOTE>seems to have been rebuilt since the time that Sir Samuel Morland dwelt in it; with a great number of stately trees, and laid out in shady walks, it obtained the name of Spring Gardens; and the house being converted into a tavern or place of entertainment, it was frequented by the votaries of pleasure.</QUOTE> 
    <P>From this period to that of the visit fof Addison and Sir Roger nothing appears to be known concerning Vauxhall; nor again from that time till the year <datestruct value="1732"><year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct>, when the house and gardens came into the possession of a gentleman named Jonathan  Tyers, who opened it with an advertisement of a <QUOTE>ridotto al fresco</QUOTE> --a term to which the people of this country had till that time been strangers.  These entertainments were several times repeated in the course of the summer, and numbers resorted to partake of them, which encouraged the proprietor to make his garden a place of musical entertainment for every evening during the summer season. To this end he was at great expense in decorating the gardens with paintings; he engaged an excellent band of musicians, and issued silver tickets for admission at a guinea each; and receiving great encouragement, he set up an organ in the orchestra; and in a conspicuous part of the gardens erected a fine statue of Handel, the work of Roubiliac.   With reference to this piece of sculpture, a writer in the <hi rend=italics>Mirror</hi> (<datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>) observes:-- <QUOTE>The <num value="1">first</num> work which   can with   certainty be ascribed to Roubiliac is that statue of Handel made for Vauxhall Gardens. He wished to give a lively transcript of the living man, and he fully accomplished what he undertook. He has exhibited the eminent composer in the act of rapturous meditation when the music had fully awakened up <pb id="P.450" n="450"> his soul.   His gladness of face and agitation of body tell us that the sculptor imagined Handel's finest strains to have been conceived amidst contortions worthy of the Cumean Sybil.   Though every button of his dress seems to have sat for its likeness, and every button-hole is finished with the fastidiousness of a fashionable tailor, the clothes are infected with the agitation of the man, and are in staring disorder. It did not remain long at Vauxhall, but the cause of its removal has not been stated.    <Q>It stood,</Q>  says Smith,  <Q>in <datestruct value="1744--"><year reg="1744">1744</year></datestruct>, on the south side of the gardens, under an enclosed lofty arch, surmounted by a figure playing the violoncello, attended by <num value="2">two</num> boys; and it was then screened from the weather by a curtain, which was drawn up when the visitors arrived.   The ladies then walked in these and Mary-le-bone Gardens in their hoops, sacques, and caps, as they appeared in their own drawing-rooms; whilst the gentlemen were generally uncovered, with their hats under their arms, and swords and bags.   The statue, after being moved to various situations in the gardens, was at length conveyed to the house of Mr. Barrett, of Stockwell, and from thence to the entrance-hall of the residence of his son, the Rev.

 Mr. Barrett, Duke Street, Westminster.</Q>    From Mr. Barrett's hands the statue found its way, after various vicissitudes of fortune, to a house in Dean Street, where it awaits a fresh purchaser.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The son of the original proprietor of these gardens, Thomas Tyers, having been bred for the bar, became <num value="1">one</num> of Dr. Johnson's friends, and, indeed, published a biographical sketch of him, which is now forgotten.   He likewise published sketches of Pope and Addison, and a work of higher pretension, <QUOTE>Political Conferences.</QUOTE> He is pleasantly, though somewhat contemptuously, described   in   No. <num value="48">48</num>   of the <hi rend=italics>Idler</hi>, under the 
<hi rend=italics>sobriquet</hi> of <QUOTE>Tom Restless.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Considering that Dr. Johnson was so frequent a visitor at the gardens, it is astonishing that there should be so few allusions to them in the burly Doctor's life by Boswell. 
   <P> <QUOTE>That excellent place of amusement,</QUOTE> writes Johnson, <QUOTE>which must ever be an estate to its proprietor, as it is peculiarly adapted to the taste of the English nation; there being a mixture of curious show, gay exhibition, music, vocal and instrumental, not too refined for the general ear, for all which only a shilling is paid; and, though <pb id="P.451" n="451">

   <P>Boswell, in his notes, tells us that in the summer of <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>, additional and more expensive decorations having been introduced, the price of admission was doubled, and adds his own disapproval of the plan, on the ground that a number of the honest commonalty were thereby excluded.   Mr. J. Wilson Croker, in his edition of Boswell, adds that the admission was subsequently raised to <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure>, <QUOTE>without improving either the class of company or the profits of the proprietors.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Among Tyers's numerous friends was Hogarth, who, as we have already seen, had a residence in this neighbourhood,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="340">340</num>.</NOTE>
and who, to add to the attractions of the place, advised Tyers to decorate the boxes with paintings. For the following account of the way in which Hogarth, as a painter, became connected with the gardens, we are indebted to a selection of anecdotes published under the title of <QUOTE>Art and Artists :</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>Soon after his marriage, Hogarth had summer lodgings at South Lambeth, and hence became intimate with Jonathan Tyers, the proprietor of Vauxhall Gardens.   On passing the   tavern which stood at the   entrance, <num value="1">one</num> morning, Hogarth saw Tyers, and, observing him to be very melancholy, asked him,  <Q>How now, Master Tyers? why so sad this morning?</Q>   <Q>Sad times these, Master Hogarth,</Q>  replied   Tyers;  <Q>and   my reflections were   on   a   subject not likely to brighten a man's countenance.   I was thinking which is the easiest death, hanging or drowning.</Q>     <Q>Oh!</Q>  said Hogarth,  <Q>is it come to that?</Q>   <Q> Very nearly, I assure you,</Q>  replied Tyers.  <Q>Then,</Q>  said Hogarth,  <Q> the remedy that you think of applying is not likely to mend the matter; don't hang or drown yourself to-day, my friend. I have a thought that may save the necessity of either, and will communicate it to you if you will call on me to-morrow morning at my studio in Leicester Fields.</Q> <NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="167">167</num>.</NOTE>   The interview took place, and the result was the concocting and getting up of the <num value="1">first</num>  <Q>Ridotto al Fresco,</Q>  which was very successful; <num value="1">one</num> of the new attractions being the embellishment of the pavilions of the gardens by Hogarth's own pencil.   Thus he drew the  <Q><num value="4">Four</num> Parts of the Day,</Q>  which Hayman copied, and the <num value="2">two</num> scenes of  <Q>Evening</Q>  and  <Q>Night,</Q>  with portraits of Henry VIII. and Anne Boleyn.   Hayman, it should be stated here, was <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest members of the Royal Academy, and when young was a scenepainter at Drury Lane Theatre.   Hogarth at this time was in prosperity, and assisted Tyers more essentially even than by the few pieces which he painted for the gardens; and in return for this good service Tyers presented the painter with a gold ticket of admission in perpetuity for himself and   his friends, which was handed   down   to Hogarth's descendants--the ticket admitting <num value="6">six</num> persons, or, in the current language of the day,  <Q><num value="1">one</num> coach </Q> --that is, <num value="1">one</num> coachful.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Malcolm, in his <QUOTE>Anecdotes of London,</QUOTE> tells us that the <num value="1">first</num> notice of the gardens which he had been able to find in the newspapers, was in <datestruct VALUE="1732-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct>, when the <QUOTE>Ridotto al Fresco</QUOTE> is mentioned, as having been given here. The company were estimated at <num value="400">400</num> persons, in the proportion of <num value="10">ten</num> men to <num value="1">one</num> woman; and he tells us that most of them wore dominos, lawyers' gowns, and masks, and other disguises, though many were without either. <QUOTE>The company,</QUOTE> Malcolm adds, <QUOTE>retired between <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> in the morning, and order was preserved by <num value="100">100</num> soldiers who were stationed at the entrance</QUOTE> --a precaution which seems to explain very significantly the character of the company whom the worthy proprietor was led to expect. 
    <P>Though Pepys tells us that a visit to these gardens was not expensive, yet Bonnell Thornton furnishes a ludicrous account of a stingy old citizen loosing his purse-strings in order to treat his wife and family to Vauxhall; and Colin's description to his wife of <QUOTE>Greenwood Hall, or the pleasures of Spring Gardens,</QUOTE> gives a lively picture of what this modern Arcadia was something more than a century ago. 
    <P>Grosely, in his <QUOTE>Tour to London,</QUOTE> writes (with reference to Vauxhall and Ranelagh<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="77">77</num>.</NOTE>):-- <QUOTE>These entertainments, which begin in the month of May, are continued every night.   They bring together persons of all ranks and conditions; and amongst these a considerable number of females, whose charms want only that cheerful air, which is the flower and quintessence of beauty. These places serve equally as a rendezvous either for business or intrigue. They form, as it were, private coteries; there you see fathers and mothers, with   their children, enjoying domestic happiness in the midst of public diversions. The English assert that such entertainments as these can never subsist in France, on account of the levity of the people.   Certain it is that those of Vauxhall and Ranelagh, which are guarded only by outward decency, are conducted without tumult and disorder, which often disturb the public diversions of France.   I do not know   whether the English are gainers thereby; <pb id="P.453" n="453"> the joy which they seem   in search of at those places does not beam through their countenances; they look as grave at Vauxhall and Ranelagh as at the Bank, at church, or a private club. All persons here seem to say, what a young English nobleman said to his governor, <Q>Am I as joyous as I should be?</Q></QUOTE> 
  <P>When we endeavour to re-people these gardens with the gay crowds which a century ago frequented them, so light of heart and buoyant of spirit, we cannot help remembering the words of Dr. Johnson on the subject of their rival, Ranelagh, uttered in <num value="1">one</num> of his gravest moods- <QUOTE>Alas, sir! these are only struggles for happiness! When I <num value="1">first</num> entered Ranelagh, it gave to my mind an expansion of gay sensation such as I never experienced anywhere else; but as Xerxes wept when he viewed his immense army, and considered that not <num value="1">one</num> of that great multitude would be alive a <num value="100">hundred</num> years afterwards, so it went to my heart to consider that there was not <num value="1">one</num> in all that brilliant circle that was not afraid to go home and think.</QUOTE> 
  <P>Perhaps the best defence of such places of public resort as Vauxhall is to be found in the well-known words of Dr. Johnson, though spoken of another place.   Having come from   the Pantheon, Boswell said there was not half-a-guinea's worth of pleasure in seeing that place. <QUOTE><hi rend=italics>Johnson:</hi>
 <Q> But, sir, there is half-a-guinea's worth of inferiority to other people in not having seen it.</Q>  <hi rend=italics>Boswell:</hi>
 <Q>I doubt, sir, whether there are many happy people here.</Q>  <hi rend=italics>Johnson</hi>:  <Q>Yes, sir, there are many happy people here. There are many people here who are watching hundreds, and who think hundreds are watching them.</Q> </QUOTE> 
  <P>Vauxhall Gardens would appear at <num value="1">first</num> to have served as a substitute for the old Spring Gardens at Charing Cross, when, thanks to the Puritans, the latter ceased to be a place of public entertainment, and began to be covered with private residences. After the Restoration, builders invaded Spring Gardens, and its name, and its <QUOTE>good--will</QUOTE> too, was transferred to Vauxhall.      Except the <QUOTE>spring,</QUOTE> the amusements were nearly the same as in the old garden.   The <QUOTE>close walks</QUOTE> were an especial attraction for other reasons than   the nightingales, which, in their proper season, warbled in the trees. <QUOTE>The windings and turnings in the little wilderness,</QUOTE> observes Tom   Brown, <QUOTE>are so intricate that the most experienced mothers have often lost themselves here in looking for their daughters.</QUOTE> 
  <P>In the time of Addison, as we have already seen, these gardens continued to be noted for their nightingales, and for their sirens; and Sir Roger de Coverley is represented as wishing that there were more of the former and fewer of the latter, in which case he would have been a more frequent customer.   In our day, and, indeed, during the last half century of their existence, the gardens grew worse off for nightingales than ever, while the undesirable element showed   no tendency to diminish in numbers. 
   <P>It appears from a notice by the proprietor, in <datestruct value="1736--"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct>, that, <QUOTE>being ambitious of obliging the polite and worthy part of the town,</QUOTE> at <num value="1">first</num> he admitted the public by shilling tickets, in order <QUOTE>to keep away such as were not fit to mix with those persons of quality, ladies and gentlemen, and others, who should honour him with their company;</QUOTE> but that owing to the misconduct of his numerous servants, and also for other reasons, he had resolved to abandon the plan, and to take the shillings at the gate.   But <num value="2">two</num> years later the ticket-system   was revived; for in <datestruct VALUE="1738-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>, the following notice was issued by the master of the gardens :-- <QUOTE>The entertainment will be opened at the end of April or the beginning of May (as the weather permits), and continue <num value="3">three</num> months, or longer, with the usual illuminations and bands of music, and several considerable additions and improvements to the organ.   A <num value="1000">thousand</num> tickets only will be delivered out, at <measure value="24s." type=currency><num value="24">24</num>s.</measure> each; the silver of every ticket to be worth <measure value="3s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>, and to admit <num value="2">two</num> persons every evening, Sundays excepted, during   the   season. Every person coming without a ticket to pay is. each time for admittance. No servants in livery to walk in the garden.   All subscribers are warned not to permit their tickets to get into the hands of persons of evil repute, there being an absolute necessity to exclude all such.</QUOTE> The Watermen's Company gave notice at the same time that <num value="2">two</num> of their beadles would attend at Vauxhall Stairs from   <num value="5">five</num> till <datestruct value="11"><year reg="11">eleven</year></datestruct> nightly, to prevent impositions by members of their society. 
    <P>In the absence of bridges, the chief access to the gardens, at that period, was necessarily by water, and a gay and animated scene the Thames must have presented at such times.   The author of <QUOTE>A   Trip to Vauxhall,</QUOTE> published in the year <datestruct value="1737"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>, describes his start from Whitehall Stairs in the following terms :

 This poem is worth reading, not on account of its intrinsic merits, but for the sake of the satirical allusions to the company which it contains, and which, being of a contemporary   date, gives a graphic account of the manners of the place and time.   The frontispiece, too, is curious, representing the gardens and the orchestra, with waiters wearing badges, and carrying bottles of wine to the company. 
    <P>Vauxhall Gardens, until about the year <datestruct value="1730"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, must have resembled <num value="1">one</num> of the tea-gardens of our own time, being <QUOTE>planted with trees and laid out into walks;</QUOTE> and it was not until the above date that it became exclusively a place of evening entertainment; for Addison refers to it as the <QUOTE>Spring Garden,</QUOTE> and speaks of <QUOTE>the choirs of birds that sang upon the trees.</QUOTE> A   fuller account of the gardens is given in a letter professedly written by a foreigner to his friend at Paris, and which was published in the <hi rend=italics>Champion</hi> of the <datestruct VALUE="1742-08-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct>.   The writer had previously visited Ranelagh, and in reference to that place says, <QUOTE>I was now (at Vauxhall) introduced to a place of a very different kind from that I had visited the night before-vistas, woods, tents, buildings, and company, I had a glimpse of, but could discover none of them distinctly, for which reason I began to repine that we had not arrived sooner, when all in a moment, as if by magic, every object was made visible--I should rather say, illustrious-by a <num value="1000">thousand</num> lights finely disposed, which were kindled at <num value="1">one</num> and the same signal, and my ears and my eyes, head and heart, were captivated at once. Right before extended a long and regular vista. On my right hand I stepped into a delightful grove, wild, as if planted by the hand of Nature, under the foliage of which, at equal distances, I found <num value="2">two</num> similar tents, of such a contrivance and form as a painter of genius and judgment would choose to adorn his landscape with.   Farther on, still on my right, through a noble triumphal arch with a grand curtain, still in the picturesque style, artificially thrown over it, an excellent statue of Handel (Roubiliac's) appears in the action of playing upon the lyre, which is finely set off by various greens, which form in miniature a sort of woody theatre.   The grove itself is bounded on <num value="3">three</num> sides, except the intervals made by the <num value="2">two</num> vistas which lead to and from   it with a plain but handsome colonnade, divided into different departments to receive different companies, and distinguished and adorned with paintings which, though slight, are well fancied, and have a very good effect. In the middle centre of the grove, fronting a handsome banqueting-room, the very portico of which is adorned and illuminated with curious lustres of crystal glass, stands the orchestra (for music likewise here is the soul of the entertainment); and at some distance behind it a pavilion that beggars all description--I do not mean for the richness of the materials of which it is composed, but for the nobleness of the design, and the elegance of the decorations with which it is adorned.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Perhaps there was not often a gayer or more lively evening spent at Vauxhall than that of the longest day in <datestruct VALUE="1750-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>, when, as Horace Walpole tells his friend Montagu, Lady C. Petersham made up a party, including himself, Lord March (afterwards the Duke of Queensberry, <QUOTE>Old Q.</QUOTE> ), Mr. O&lsquo;Brien, the Duke of Kingston, Lord Orford, Mr. Whitehead, Harry Vane, the <QUOTE>pretty Miss Beauclerk,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>foolish</QUOTE> Miss Sparre, and Miss Ashe, a lively girl of high parentage on her father's side, known in society as <QUOTE>The Pollard Ashe.</QUOTE> The gossiping Walpole narrates the sallies of wit and fun with which they passed the time pleasantly away, and adds: <QUOTE>We minced <num value="7">seven</num> chickens into a china dish, which Lady Caroline stewed over a lamp with <num value="3">three</num> pats of butter and a flagon of water, stirring, rattling, and laughing, and we every moment expecting to have the dish fly about our ears. She had brought Betty, the fruit-girl, with hampers and strawberries and cherries, and made her wait upon us, and then made her sup by us at a little table.</QUOTE> It was on their way home on this memorable night that they <QUOTE>picked up Lord Granby, arrived very drunk from Jenny's Whim,</QUOTE> as related by us in our account of Chelsea.<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="45">45</num>.</NOTE>   We should much like to have formed <num value="1">one</num> of the party on this occasion, or at all events to have occupied a box hard by, as we should have been sure to have been highly amused by the wit and repartee of the sprightly demoiselles. 
   <P>Walpole has also described, in another letter to his friend Montagu, an evening which he spent with Mr. Conway in the next season at a <hi rend=italics>ridotto alfresco</hi> at Vauxhall, for which the entrance was <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure>. He describes the crowd of visitors and of coaches, and of men masquerading in the dress of Turks, &amp;c. In explanation of the term <QUOTE>,Ridotto,</QUOTE> we may refer our readers to Lord Byron, who in his <QUOTE>Beppo</QUOTE> thus covertly satirises Vauxhall : <pb id="P.455" n="455"> 
  <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>They went to the Ridotto--&lsquo;tis a hall

       <L>But that's of no importance to my strain. 
     <L>&lsquo;Tis, on a smaller scale, like our Vauxhall, 
       <L>Excepting that it can't be spoilt by rain. 
     <L>The company is mix'd--the phrase I quote is 
     <L>As much as saying,  <Q>They're below your notice.</Q> </QUOTE>

   <P>The <QUOTE>illuminated saloons and groves of Vauxhall,</QUOTE> as they are styled in <QUOTE>Merrie England in the Olden Time,</QUOTE> are thus celebrated by Fielding in his <QUOTE>Amelia:</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>The   extreme beauty and elegance of this place is well known to almost every <num value="1">one</num> of my readers, and happy is it for me that it is so, since to give an adequate account of it would exceed my power of description. To delineate the particular beauties of these gardens would indeed require as much pains, and as much paper too, as to rehearse all the good actions of their master, whose life proves the truth of an observation which I have read in some other writer, that a truly elegant taste is generally accompanied with an excellency of heart; or, in other words, that true virtue is indeed nothing else but true taste.</QUOTE> The gardens, no doubt, were made not only an elegant place of enjoyment, but also as innocent as the manners and customs of the times would permit; but, nevertheless, the season of <datestruct value="1759--"><year reg="1759">1759</year></datestruct>, and again that of <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct>, appear to have been notorious for the bad behaviour of the company, in spite of the proprietor's laudable efforts to keep the place decent and respectable.   In the latter year, complaints having been made on the subject on the day fixed by the magistrates for licensing the public places of amusement, the proprietor pledged himself that the dark walks should thenceforward be lighted, and that a sufficient number of watchmen should be provided to keep the peace. 
    <P>The gardens are described in a very dry and matter-of-fact manner by Northouck, who wrote in <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>.   From him it appears that the visitors were always most orderly and <QUOTE>respectable,</QUOTE> and that the illuminations, &amp;c., were almost always over by <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock.   In respect of early hours it is to be feared that we have not much improved on our grandfathers. 
    <P>Angelo, in his <QUOTE>Reminiscences,</QUOTE> published in the reign of George IV., thus describes the gardens as he had known them in his youth :--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>I remember the time when Vauxhall (in <datestruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct>, the price ol admission being then only <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure>) was more a bear-garden than a rational place of resort, and most particularly on the Sunday mornings.   It was then crowded from <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="6">six</num> with gentry, girls of the town, apprentices, shop-boys, &amp;c.   Crowds of citizens were to be seen trudging home with their wives and children.   Rowlandson, the artist, and myself have often been there, and he has found plenty of employment for his pencil.   The <hi rend=italics>chef d&lsquo;euvre</hi> of his caricatures, which is still in print, is his drawing of Vauxhall, in which he has introduced a variety of characters known at the time, particularly that of my old schoolfellow, Major  Topham, the <Q>macaroni</Q> of the day.   <num value="1">One</num> curious scene he sketched on the spot purposely for me.  It was this. A citizen and his family are seen all seated in a box eating supper, when <num value="1">one</num> of the riff-raff in the gardens throws a bottle in the middle of the table, breaking the dishes and the glasses.  The old man swearing, the wife fainting, and the children screaming, afforded full scope for his humorous pencil. 
    <P>Such night-scenes as were then tolerated are now become obsolete.   Rings were made in every part of the gardens to decide quarrels; it now no sooner took place in <num value="1">one</num> quarter than, by a contrivance of the light-fingered gentry, another row was created in another quarter, to attract the crowd away. 
    <P>Mrs. Weichsell (Mrs. Billington's mother) was the principal female singer. The men were Joe  Vernon, of Drury Lane Theatre, &amp;c.; Barthelmon, leader of the band; Fisher, hautboy; and Mr.  Hook, conductor and composer. The dashers of that day, instead of returning home in the morning from Vauxhall, used to go to the <Q>Star and Garter</Q>
at Richmond. . . . On week-days I have seen many of the nobility-particularly the Duchess of  Devonshire, &amp;c.-with a large party, supping in the rooms facing the orchestra, French horns playing to them all the time.</QUOTE>

    <P>Vauxhall in its best days was frequented by all the   successive generations of humorists, from  Addison down to Hogarth and Oliver Goldsmith; and by literary men, from Dr. Johnson down to  Macaulay, George Hanger (Lord Coleraine), Captain Gronow, Lord William Lennox, Mr. Grantley  Berkeley, Douglas Jerrold, Leigh Hunt, Thackeray, and Dickens. 
     <P>Goldsmith, when he had achieved his <num value="1">first</num> successes in literature, and in those lucid intervals when he had a good coat on his back and a few shillings in his pocket, especially in the last year of his life, was often a visitor here, along with Dr.   Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds, dressed in a suit of velvet, of course.   Goldsmith, describing a <QUOTE>Visit to Vauxhall,</QUOTE> about the year <datestruct value="1760"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>, having praised the singers and the very excellent band, continues :-- <QUOTE>The satisfaction which I received the <num value="1">first</num> night [of the season] I went there was greater than my expectations; I went in company <pb id="P.456" n="456"> of several friends of both sexes, whose virtues I regard and judgments I esteem.   The music, the entertainments, but particularly the singing, diffused that good humour among us which constitutes the true happiness of society.</QUOTE> The same author's account of these gardens in the <QUOTE>Citizen of the World</QUOTE> contains some interesting passages. This occurs in the description of the visit of the shabby beau, the man in black, and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> other persons, in company with the Chinese philosopher. The beau's lady, Mrs. Tibbs, has a natural aversion to the water, and the pawnbroker's widow, being <QUOTE>a little in flesh,</QUOTE> protests against walking; so a coach is agreed on as the mode of conveyance. <QUOTE>The illuminations,</QUOTE> says the philosopher, <QUOTE>began before we arrived, and I must confess that upon entering the gardens I found every sense overpaid with more than expected pleasure; the lights everywhere glimmering through scarcely-moving trees; the full-bodied concert bursting on the stillness of night; the natural concert of the birds in the more retired part of the grove vying with that which was formed by art; the company, gaily dressed, looking satisfaction; and the tables spread with various delicacies; all conspired to fill my imagination with 
<FIGURE id="Fig.456" n="2000.14.0167"><HEAD>The Old Village Of Vauxhall, With Entrance To The Gardens, In <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 the visionary happiness of the Arabian lawgiver, and lifted me into an ecstacy of admiration. <Q>Head of Confucius,</Q> cried I to my friend,  <Q> this is fine! this unites rural beauty with courtly magnificence.</Q> </QUOTE> A dispute between the <num value="2">two</num> ladies now engages the philosopher's attention. <QUOTE>Miss Tibbs was for keeping the genteel walk of the garden, where, she observed, there was always the very best company; the widow, on the contrary, who came but once a season, was for securing a good standing-place to see the water-works, which, she assured us, would begin in less than an hour at furthest.</QUOTE> The cascade here referred to had been but recently introduced into the gardens, and was then doubtless a great attraction.   A   few years later the <QUOTE>water-works</QUOTE> were greatly improved, and called the Cataract. The effects then produced were very ingenious and beautiful; and at the signal for their commencement--the ringing of a bell at <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock-there was a general rush from all parts of the gardens. 
   <P>Garrick was a frequent visitor here, as also were the fair Gunnings, who made a greater noise in the world of fashion than any women since the days of Helen. <QUOTE>They are declared,</QUOTE> writes Walpole, <QUOTE>to be the handsomest women alive; they can't walk <pb id="P.457" n="457"> in the park, or go to Vauxhall, but such crowds follow them that they are generally driven away.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Another frequenter of Vauxhall Gardens was that eccentric person, Sir Henry Bate Dudley; and amongst the regular visitors here towards the close of the last century was the equally eccentric baronet, <LEMMA id="lemma.457.1">Sir John Dinely</LEMMA>, so well known for his matrimonial advertisements. It was his habit to attend here on public nights twice or <num value="3">three</num> times every season, when he would parade up and down the most public parts; and it is said that whenever it was known that he was coming, the ladies would flock in shoals to the gardens. He wore his wig fastened in a curious manner by a piece of stay-tape under his chin, and was always dressed in a cloak with long flowing folds, and a broad hat which looked as if it had started out of a picture by Vandyke.   In spite, however, of his persistent efforts to gain a rich wife by advertisement, he died a bachelor, an inmate of the poor knights' quarters in Windsor Castle, in <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>.   Here is <num value="1">one</num> of his advertisements, taken from the <hi rend=italics>Ipswich Journal</hi> of <datestruct VALUE="1802-08-21"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=21>21st</day>, <year reg=1802>1802</year></datestruct> :-- <QUOTE>To the angelic fair of the true English breed.

 himself and his ample fortune to any angelic beauty of a good breed, fit to become and willing to be the mother of a noble heir, and keep up the name of an ancient family ennobled by deeds of arms and ancestral renown. Ladies at a certain period of life need not apply. Fortune favours the bold. Such ladies as this advertisement may induce to apply or send their agents (but no servants or matrons), may direct to me at the Castle, Windsor.   Happiness and pleasure are agreeable objects, and should be regarded as well as honour. The lady who shall thus become my wife will be a baroness [query, baronet'ess], and rank accordingly as Lady Dinely, of Windsor.   Goodwill and favour to all ladies of Great Britain! pull no caps on his account, but favour him with your smiles, and paeans of pleasure await your steps.</QUOTE> It should be added, that though his <QUOTE>ample fortune</QUOTE> was moonshine, his title was genuine, and not a sham. 
   <P>Another frequent visitor to the gardens was Lord Barrymore, whose pugilistic and other freaks are related in amusing detail by Mr. Angelo in his <QUOTE>Reminiscences.</QUOTE> They are not, however, sufficiently edifying to bear repeating here, <pb id="P.458" n="458"> 
    <P>Apparently   the   Princess   of Wales was an occasional visitor here during the time of her long-standing rupture with her husband; such, at all events, is the inference to be drawn from an epigram   on <QUOTE>a certain unexpected visit to a late

    <P>Readers of Thackeray will not have forgotten the visit paid-out of the season--to Vauxhall by  Mr. Pendennis, when he meets Captain Costigan, and gains admission at the entrance for Fanny  Bolton, the   pretty   daughter of the porter of <QUOTE>Shepherd's</QUOTE> Inn, and who, having never before seen the gardens, is equally affected with wonder and delight at the lamps and the company.

   <P>Vauxhall Gardens, down to a very late date, still attracted <QUOTE>the upper <num value="10000">ten thousand</num></QUOTE> --occasionally, at least.   We are told incidentally, in Forster's <QUOTE>Life of Dickens,</QUOTE> that <num value="1">one</num> famous night, the <datestruct VALUE="1849-06-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>, Dickens went there with Judge Talfourd, Stanfield, and Sir Edwin Landseer. The  <QUOTE>Battle of Waterloo</QUOTE>  formed part of the entertainment on that occasion. <QUOTE>We were astounded,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Forster, <QUOTE>to see pass in immediately before us, in a bright white overcoat, the  <Q>great duke</Q>  himself, with Lady Douro on his arm, the little Lady Ramsays by his side, and everybody cheering and clearing the way for him. That the old hero enjoyed it all there could be no doubt, and he made no secret of his delight in  <Q>Young Hernandez; </Q>  but the battle was undeniably tedious; and it was impossible not to sympathise with the repeatedly and audibly expressed wish of Talfourd that  <Q>the Prussians would come up!</Q> </QUOTE> It must have been <num value="1">one</num> of the old duke's last appearances in a place of amusement, as he lived only <num value="3">three</num> years longer. 
   <P>A description of the gardens as they appeared about this time, by a writer who frequented them in the last decade of their glory, may not be out of place here:-- <QUOTE>The mode of entrance into the gardens, which extend over about <num value="11">eleven</num> acres, is admirably calculated to enhance their extraordinary effect on the <num value="1">first</num> view.   We step at once from the passages into a scene of enchantment, such as in our young days opened upon our eyes as we pored over the magical pages of the  <title>Arabian Nights</title>. It were indeed worth some sacrifice of time, money, and convenience to see for once in a lifetime that view. At <num value="1">first</num>, <num value="1">one</num> wide-extended and interminable blaze of radiance is the idea impressed upon the dazzled beholder.   As his eyes grow accustomed to the place, he perceives the form of the principal part of the gardens resolve itself into a kind of long quadrangle, formed by <num value="4">four</num> colonnades which   inclose an open   space with trees, called the Grove. On his right extends <num value="1">one</num> of the colonnades, some <num value="300">three hundred</num> feet long, with an arched Gothic roof, where the groins are marked by lines of lamps, shedding a yellow-golden <pb id="P.459" n="459"> light, and the pendants by single crimson lamps of a larger size at the intersections. The effect of this management is most superb.   Near the eye the lines or groins appear singly, showing their purpose; farther off, they grow closer and closer, till at some distance the entire vista beyond appears <num value="1">one</num> rich blaze of radiance. In front, the visitor looks across <num value="1">one</num> of the shorter ends of the quadrangle, illuminated in a different but still more magnificent manner by a chandelier of great size, formed of coloured lamps, and by various smaller chandeliers. Still standing in the same place (at the door of entrance), and looking across the interior of the quadrangle called the Grove, midway is seen the lofty orchestra, glittering all over with the many-coloured lights diffused from innumerable lamps. This was erected in <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, and has itself many interesting memories attached to it. Beneath that vast shell which forms the roof or soundingboard of the orchestra many of our greatest vocalists and performers have poured forth their strains to the delight of the crowded auditory in front-Signor and Signora Storace, Mrs. Billington, Miss Tyrer (afterwards Mrs. Liston), Incledon, Braham, and a host of others, at once rise to the memory. The Grove is illuminated not only by the reflected light from the colonnades on either side and by the orchestra, but by festoons of lamps, gracefully undulating along the sides of the colonnades from <num value="1">one</num> end to the other. Among the other attractions of the Grove, we find immediately we step into it some beautiful plaster-casts from the antique, the light colour of which forms a fine contrast with the blackness of the neighbouring trees and the solemn gloom of the sky above, which assumes a still deeper tinge when seen under such circumstances.   Immediately opposite these, at the back of the short colonnade which forms this end of the Grove, with elevated arches opening upon the colonnade, is the splendid room originally called the Pavilion, now the Hall of Mirrors, a title more appropriate as marking its distinctive character, the walls being lined with looking-glass.   This is the principal supper-room. Turning the corner, we enter upon the other of the <num value="2">two</num> principal colonnades, which is similarly illuminated.   A little way down we find an opening into the Rotunda, a very large and handsome building, with boxes, pit, and gallery in the circular part, and on <num value="1">one</num> side a stage for the performance of ballets, &amp;c. The pit forms also, when required, an arena for the display of horsemanship. At the end of this colonnade we have on the right the colonnade forming the other extremity of the Grove, hollowed out into a semi-circular form, the space being fitted up somewhat in the manner of a Turkish divan.   On the left we find the more distant and darker parts of the gardens.   Here the <num value="1">first</num> spot that attracts our attention is a large space, the back of which presents a kind of mimic amphitheatre of trees and foliage, having in front rockwork and fountains.   From   <num value="1">one</num> of the latter Eve has just issued, as we perceive by the beautiful figure reclining on the grass above. Not far from this place a fine cast of Diana arresting the flying hart stands out in admirable relief from the darkgreen leafy background.   Here, too, is a large building, presenting in front the appearance of the proscenium and stage of a theatre. Ballets, performances on the tight-rope, and others of a like character, are here exhibited.     The purpose of the building is happily marked by the statues of Canova's dancing-girls, <num value="1">one</num> of which is placed on each side of the area at the front. At the corner of a long walk, between trees lighted only by single lamps, spread at intervals on the ground at the sides, is seen a characteristic representation of Tell's cottage in the Swiss Alps.   This walk is terminated by an illuminated transparency, placed behind a Gothic archway, representing the delicate but broken shafts of some ruined ecclesiastical structure, with a large stone cross--that characteristic feature of the way-sides of Roman Catholic countries. At right angles with this walk extends a much broader <num value="1">one</num>, with the additional illumination of a brilliant star; and at its termination is an opening containing a very imposing spectacle. This is a representation, in a large circular basin of water, of Neptune, with his trident, driving his <num value="5">five</num> sea-horses abreast, which are snorting forth liquid streams from   their nostrils; these in their ascent cross and intermingle in a very pleasing and striking manner.   The lustrous white and great size of the figures are, like all the other works of art in the gardens, admirably contrasted with the surrounding features of the place. Passing on our way the large building erected for the convenience of filling the great balloon, and the area where the fireworks are exhibited, we next enter the Italian Walk, so called from   its having been originally decorated in the formal, exact style of the walks in that country.   This is a very noble promenade, or avenue, of great length and breadth, crossed every few yards by a lofty angular arch of lamps, with festoons of the same brilliant character hanging from it, and having statues interspersed on each side throughout.     On quitting   this walk at its farthest extremity, we find ourselves in the centre of the long colonnade opposite to that we quitted in order to examine the more remote parts of the <pb id="P.460" n="460"> gardens.</QUOTE> The inner side of each of the long colonnades was occupied by innumerable supperboxes, in some of which, down to the very last, remained the pictures of which we have spoken above. 
    <P> <QUOTE><num value="1">One</num> of the subjects selected by Mr. Jonathan Tyers for the artists who decorated the supper-boxes in Vauxhall Gardens,</QUOTE> writes Mr. J. T. Smith, in his <QUOTE>Book for a Rainy Day,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>was that of  <Q>Milkmaids on May-day.</Q>  In that picture (which, with the rest, painted by Hayman and his pupils, has lately disappeared) the garland of plate was carried by a man on his head; and the milkmaids, who danced to the music of a wooden-legged fiddler, were extremely elegant. They had ruffled cuffs, and their gowns were not drawn through their pocket-holes, as in my time; their hats were flat, and not unlike that worn by Peg Woffington, but bore a nearer shape to those now in use by some of the fishwomen at Billingsgate. In the  <Q>Cries of London,</Q>  published by Tempest, there is a female, entitled  <Q>A Merry Milkmaid.</Q>  She is dancing with a small garland of plate on her head, and probably represented the fashion of Queen Anne's reign.</QUOTE> 
   <P>May-day is little observed in London at the present time, except that the omnibus-drivers and cabmen ornament their horses' heads with flowers or rosettes, and their whips with bits of ribbon, while Jack-in-the-Green and Maid Marian are to be seen in the streets.   Not so very long ago, however, certainly within the present century, says Robert Chambers, there was a somewhat similar demonstration from the milkmaids. <QUOTE>A milch cow, garlanded with flowers, was led along by a small group of dairy-women, who, in light and fantastic dresses, and with heads wreathed in flowers, would dance around the animal to the sound of a violin or clarionet. In the old gardens at Vauxhall there used to be a picture representing the May-day dance of the London milkmaids.   In this Vauxhall picture a man is represented bearing a cluster of silver flagons on his head (these flagons used to be lent by the pawnbrokers at so much an hour); while <num value="3">three</num> milkmaids are dancing to the music of a wooden-legged fiddler, some chimney-sweeps appearing as side figures.</QUOTE>

    <P>Dr. C.

   <QUOTE REND=blockquote> This beauteous garden, but by vice maintained? </QUOTE>

   <P>Albert Smith gives us the following reminiscences of Vauxhall Gardens in his <QUOTE>Sketches of London Life,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct> :--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>The earliest notions I ever had of Vauxhall were formed from an old coloured print which decorated a bed-room   at home, and represented the gardens as they were in the time of hoops and high head-dresses, bagwigs and swords.   The general outline was almost that of the present day, and the disposition of the orchestra, firework-ground, and covered walks the same.   But the royal property was surrounded by clumps of trees and pastures; shepherds smoked their pipes where the tall chimneys of Lambeth now   pour out their dense encircling clouds, to blight or blacken every attempt at vegetation in the neighbourhood ; and where the rustics played cricket at the water-side, massive arches and mighty girders bear the steaming, gleaming, screaming train on its way to the new terminus.   I had a vague notion, also, of the style of entertainments there offered.   In several old pocket-books and magazines, that were kept covered with mould and cobwebs in a damp spare-room closet, I used to read the ballads put down as  <Q> sung by Mrs. Wrighten at Vauxhall.</Q>  They were not very extraordinary compositions. Here is <num value="1">one</num>, which may be taken as a sample of all, called a  <Q>Rondeau,</Q>  sung by Mrs. Weichsel; set by Mr. Hook : 
         <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=couplet><L>Maidens, let your lovers languish,

    <P> <QUOTE>I was also told of hundreds of thousands of lamps, and an attempt was made to imitate their effect by pricking pinholes in the picture and putting a light behind it--for the glass had disappeared at some remote period, and had never been replaced; and for years I looked forward to going to Vauxhall as a treat too magnificent ever to take place.</QUOTE> 
    <P>He tells us that the time came, though not until he was <num value="12">twelve</num> years old, and then it was to celebrate his promotion into a higher form at Merchant Taylor's School. <QUOTE><num value="20">Twenty</num> years have gone by,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>since that eventful night, but the impression made upon me is as vivid as it was on the following day.   I remember being shown .the lights of the orchestra twinkling through the trees from the road, and hearing the indistinct crash of the band as I waited for all our party, literally trembling with expectation at the pay place. Then there came the dark   passage, which I hurried along with feelings almost of awe; and finally the bewildering <foreign lang=fr>coup d&lsquo;oeil</foreign>, as the dazzling walk before the   great supper-room, with   its balloons, and flags, and crowns of light-its panels of lookingglass, and long lines of radiant stars, festoons, and arches burst upon me and took away my breath, with almost every other faculty. I could not speak.   I heard nothing that was said to me; and if anybody had afterwards assured me that I entered the garden upon my head instead of my heels I could scarcely have contradicted them. I have never experienced anything like the intensity of that feeling but once since; and that was when I caught the <num value="1">first</num> sight of London by night from a great elevation, during the balloon ascent last year which so nearly terminated in the destruction of all our party. <pb id="P.462" n="462"> 
   <P>The entire evening was to me <num value="1">one</num> scene of continuous enchantment.   The Battle of Waterloo was being represented on the firework-ground, and I could not divest myself of the idea that it was a real engagement I was witnessing, as the sharpshooters fired from behind the trees, the artillerywagon blew up, and the struggle and conflagration took place at Hougoumont.   When I stood, years afterwards, on the real battle-field I was disappointed in its effect.   I thought it ought to have been a great deal more like Vauxhall. 
   <P>The supper was another great feature-eating by the light of variegated lamps, with romantic views painted on the walls, and music playing all the time, was on a level with the most brilliant entertainment described in the maddest, wildest traditions of Eastern story-tellers.</QUOTE>

   <P>Mrs. Weichsel, mentioned in the above quotation, was the favourite singer here a century ago: she was the mother of the famous actress, Mrs. Billington.   Arne and Boyce composed music for these gardens; and nearly all the vocal celebrities of the latter half of the last century and the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="30">thirty</num> years of this appeared in the orchestra, where all the instrumentalists wore cocked hats.

   <P>Some idea of the place in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct> may be gathered from the remarks of a <QUOTE>wonder-struck boy,</QUOTE> Master Peter, given in Hone's <QUOTE>Table Book</QUOTE> :-- <QUOTE>Oh, my! what a sweet place!

   <P>Another writer about this time, in the <hi rend=italics>World</hi>
(No. <num value="63">63</num>), gives vent to the following bantering remarks :-- <QUOTE>I have heard that the master of Vauxhall, who so plentifully supplies beef for our bodily refreshment, has, for the entertainment of those who visit him at his country house, no less plentifully provided for the mind; where the guest may call for a skull to chew upon the instability of human life, or sit down to a collation of poetry, of which the hangings of his room of entertainment take up, as I am told, many yards. I wish that this grand purveyor of beef and poetry would transport some of the latter to his gardens at Vauxhall. Odes and songs pasted upon the lamp-posts would be, I <pb id="P.463" n="463">

 <pb id="P.464" n="464"> believe, much more studiously attended to than the price-list of cheese-cakes and custards; and if the unpictured boxes were hung round with celebrated passages out of favourite poets, many a company would find something to say, who would otherwise sit cramming themselves in silent stupidity.</QUOTE> 
    <P> <QUOTE>Vauxhall Gardens have undergone,</QUOTE> writes the Rev. J. Richardson, in <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>, in his <QUOTE>Recollections,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>little change within my recollection. The place was certainly attended, <num value="50">fifty</num> years ago, by people of a more aristocratic rank than it has been of late years. George IV., when Prince of Wales, and his brothers, were formerly amongst the visitors; and their presence attracted other people, who thought it expedient to do as their betters did, and imitate the practices of the great. It was at that time decorated with better pictures than the daubs by which the walls of the boxes are now covered; but the amusements, the fireworks, and the illumination of the coloured lamps, were neither so much diversified, so numerous, or so brilliant. I never recollect it resembling the account given in the 
<hi rend=italics>Spectator</hi>, either as to the warbling of the birds or the beauty of the groves, &amp;c. The slices of ham were as transparent <num value="50">fifty</num> years ago as they are now; the chickens were as diminutive as now-a-days; the charges were equally extravagant. People did not drink so much champagne, but they contrived to get the headache with arrack-punch, and kettles of <Q> burnt</Q>  wine were in more request than brandy and water. The vocal performances were better, the concerts were better conducted; the dancing was much the same as now, and those who took part in it were neither morally nor physically any better than their successors.</QUOTE> In his subsequent pages Mr. Richardson sketches off some of the <QUOTE>characters</QUOTE> connected with Vauxhall: such as Bradbury, the clown; Mr. Simpson, the <foreign lang=la>arbiter elegantiae</foreign>, and the Nepaulese princes, who, on their visit to this country, were great patrons of Vauxhall. 
    <P>A   good story is told in the <hi rend=italics>Connoisseur</hi> of a century ago about a parsimonious-old citizen going to Vauxhall with his wife and daughters, and grumbling at the dearness of the provisions and the wafer-like thinness of the slices of ham. At every mouthful the old fellow exclaims, <QUOTE>There goes twopence! there goes threepence! there goes a groat!</QUOTE> Then there is the old joke of the thinness of the slices of ham and the expert cutter, who undertook to cover the gardens--<num value="11">eleven</num> acres--with slices from <num value="1">one</num> ham! 
    <P>The author of <QUOTE>Saunterings about London</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1853--"><year reg="1853">1853</year></datestruct>) thus sums up Vauxhall Gardens and the entertainments provided here:-- <QUOTE>Vauxhall was born in the Regency, in <num value="1">one</num> of the wicked nights of dissolute Prince George. A wealthy speculator was its father; a prince was its godfather; and all the fashion and beauty of England stood round its cradle.   In those days Vauxhall was very exclusive and expensive.   At present it is open to all ranks and classes, and half-a-guinea will frank a fourthrate milliner and sweetheart through the whole evening.   A Londoner wants a great deal for his money, or he wants little-take it which way you please. The programme of Vauxhall is an immense 
 <hi rend=italics>carte</hi> for the eye and the ear: music, singing, horsemanship, illuminations,   dancing,   rope-dancing, acting, comic songs, hermits, gipsies, and fireworks, on the most  <Q>stunning</Q>  scale. It is easier to read the <hi rend=italics>Kolner Zeitzung</hi> than the play-bill of Vauxhall.  With respect to the <hi rend=italics>quantity</hi> of sights,</QUOTE> adds the writer, <QUOTE>it is most difficult to satisfy an English public.   They have  <Q>a capacious swallow</Q>  for sights, and require them in large masses, as they do the meat which graces their tables. As to quality, that is a minor consideration; and to give the  English public its due, it is the most grateful of all publics.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Fireworks were occasionally exhibited here as far back   as <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>.   <num value="4">Four</num> years later the <num value="1">first</num> balloon ascent from   the gardens was made by Garnerin and <num value="2">two</num> companions.   In <datestruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct>, Mr. Green ascended from these gardens, and remained up in the air during the night. On the afternoon of <datestruct VALUE="-11-7"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=7>7th</day></datestruct>, in the following year, Messrs. Green, Monck, Mason, and Hollond ascended here in the monster balloon, called afterwards the <QUOTE>Nassau.</QUOTE> They effected their descent next morning   near   Coblentz,   having   accomplished nearly <num value="500">500</num> miles in eighteen hours. 
   <P>In <datestruct VALUE="1837-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1837">1837</year></datestruct>, these gardens had a narrow escape from destruction by fire, which broke out <num value="1">one</num> night in the firework tower, a lofty structure <num value="80">eighty</num> feet in height, from which the pyrotechnic displays were exhibited.   At the top of this tower was a large tank, containing <num value="8000">8,000</num> gallons of water; this fell in with a tremendous crash, but, curiously enough, it produced not the slightest effect upon the flames. The whole of the tower, including the paintingroom (the largest in England), was totally destroyed, together with its contents; likewise <num value="14">fourteen</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> tall trees were burned to the ground, and twice as many damaged.   In the following month Mr. Green again ascended here in his great balloon, with Mr. Cocking in a parachute; but this performance, unfortunately, was attended with fatal results, for the latter was killed in descending. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct> Mr. Green, accompanied by Mr. Edward Spencer and Mr. Rush, of Elsenhalm --all, Essex, <pb id="P.465" n="465"> made another ascent in the <QUOTE>Nassau.</QUOTE> They descended at Debden, near Saffron Walden, fortyseven miles from the gardens, having accomplished the journey in <num value="1">one</num> hour and a half, the highest altitude attained being <num value="19335">19,335</num> feet, or nearly <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="3">three</num>-quarter miles. 
   <P>For some time ballooning served as the staple feature in the programme, and an attempt was made to render these gardens attractive by day as well as by night. Readers of <QUOTE>Boz</QUOTE> will not forget among them a chapter descriptive of the gardens by day, and of the ascent of Mr. Green in a balloon along with a <QUOTE>live lord;</QUOTE> or his remarks on the cruelty of the disillusion practised on the public by Mr. Simpson admitting visitors within its precincts when the veil of mystery which night and oil or gas lamps had previously hung around them were removed. <QUOTE>Vauxhall by daylight, indeed!      A porter-pot without the porter, the House of Commons without Mr. Speaker; pooh! nonsense! The thing was not to be thought of.</QUOTE> But <QUOTE>thought of</QUOTE> it was; the experiment was tried, but was soon given up. 
   <P>Jonathan Tyers ruled over the destinies of Vauxhall for many years. He died in <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>; and we are informed that <QUOTE>so great was the delight he took in this place, that, possessing his faculties to the last, he caused himself to be carried into the gardens a few hours before his death, to take a last look at them.</QUOTE> After Tyers' death the gardens were conducted by different managers, the bestknown of whom was a Mr. Barnett; but the property still remained with Tyers' family until <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>, when it was sold to Messrs.

Mr. Gye was afterwards M.P. for Chippenham, and father of Mr. Frederick Gye, the lessee of the Italian Opera.

   <P>Mr. Timbs, in his <QUOTE>Curiosities of London,</QUOTE> writes :-- <QUOTE>Though Vauxhall Gardens retained their place to the very last, the lamps had long fallen off in their golden fires; the punch got weaker, the admission money less; and the company fell off in a like ratio of respectability, and grew dingy, not to say  <Q>raffish</Q> --a sorry falling off from the Vauxhall crowd of a century before, when it num. bered princes and ambassadors; when  <Q>on its tide and torrent of fashion floated all the beauty of the time, and through its lighted avenues of trees glided <pb id="P.466" n="466"> cabinet ministers and their daughters, royal dukes and their wives, and all the red-heeled macaronis.</Q>  Even <num value="50">fifty</num> years before the close of the gardens the evening costume of the company was elegant; head-dresses of flowers and feathers were seen in the promenade; and the entire place sparkled as did no other place of public amusement. But low prices brought low   company.   The conventional wax-lights got fewer; the punch gave way to fiery brandy and doctored   stout.   The semblance of Vauxhall was still preserved in the representation of the orchestra printed upon the plates and mugs, and the old firework bell tinkled away as gaily as ever.   But matters grew more and more seedy; the place seemed literally worn out; the very trees grew   scrubby and shabby, and looked as if they were singed; and it was high time to say, as well to see in letters of lamps,  <Q> Farewell.</Q> </QUOTE>

 <P>Vauxhall, it may here be stated, has other interesting associations besides those connected with its defunct Gardens; for, like the Nore, it appears or old to have been the end of the course for small sailing and racing matches on the Thames. Thus  Strutt writes, in his <QUOTE>Sports and Pastimes,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>A society, generally known by the appellation of the Cumberland Society, consisting of gentlemen partial to this pastime, gives yearly a silver cup to be sailed for in the vicinity of London.   The boats usually start from   the bridge at Blackfriars, go up to Putney, and return to Vauxhall, where a vessel is moored at a distance from   the   stairs, and the sailing-boat that <num value="1">first</num> passes this mark on her return obtains the victory.</QUOTE> It would seem natural that while the chief access to the Gardens was by the <QUOTE>silent highway</QUOTE> of the  Thames and by the <QUOTE>stairs,</QUOTE> the owners of Vauxhall and of Astley's should have shown   some regard for the river and aquatic amusements; accordingly we learn from the same authority that the proprietors of those places used to give annually a wherry to be rowed for by the <QUOTE>jolly young watermen,</QUOTE> or Thames apprentices, much   like  Doggett's coat and badge are now the objects of an annual aquatic contest. 
   <P>We have, at different points of our perambulations round London, spoken of the fortifications which were erected during the Civil Wars; we may mention here that <QUOTE>a quadrant fort, with <num value="4">four</num> halfbulwarks at Vauxhall,</QUOTE> occurs among the defences of London which were ordered to be set up by the Parliament in <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>The late Mr. Loudon, as already stated by us,<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="257">257</num>.</NOTE>
proposed to make a series of boulevards round  London.   His line, if carried out, would have come down from Hyde Park to Vauxhall Bridge, and thence have passed through the heart of Vauxhall to Kennington, and so on through Camberwell to Greenwich. 
    <P>The Tradescants and Morlands, of whom we have already spoken, were not the only distinguished inhabitants of this locality in former times, for among its residents was the celebrated man of science, the Marquis of Worcester, so well known as the author of the <QUOTE>Century of Inventions,</QUOTE> if not as the inventor of the steam-engine. He lived at  Vauxhall for some years after the Restoration, from  <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct> down to his death in <datestruct value="1667--"><year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>, probably holding the post of superintendent of some works under the Government connected with the army and navy. Here he set up his <QUOTE>water-commanding engine,</QUOTE> which was naturally a great curiosity in those days, when science was at a low ebb. On this he spent nearly <measure value="60000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="60000">60,000</num></measure>, and had to pay the penalty of obloquy and calumny, which always attach to great minds in advance of their age.  His thanksgiving to Almighty God for <QUOTE>vouchsafing him an insight into so great a secret of nature beneficial to all mankind as this my watercommanding engine,</QUOTE> is <num value="1">one</num> of the most touching evidences at once of his humility and his confidence in the wonder-working power of time. To show how little the marquis was known or appreciated in his day, it may be added that, though he died in <datestruct value="1667--"><year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>, it is not certain whether he died here or at the residence of his family, Beaufort House, in the Strand.<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="101">101</num>.</NOTE>

    <P>Near Vauxhall Bridge are the large works of the London Gas Company, established in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>. <pb id="P.468" n="468"> Though situated on the south of the Thames, the company is not wrongly named, for its mains are carried across Vauxhall Bridge, and extend over a considerable distance of Pimlico, which they supply. 
   <P>Close by the gas-works is the <num value="9">Nine</num> Elms pier, so called from some lofty trees which formerly grew there, but were cut down before the South-Western Railway marked the spot for its own.   As stated by us in a previous chapter, the South-Western Railway originally had its London terminus here, the line not being allowed to be brought direct into London;<NOTE>This was the case also with the North-Western Railway, the London terminus of which was originally at Chalk Farm; see Vol. V., p. <num value="350">350</num>.</NOTE> but upon the extension of the line to the Waterloo Road, in   the year <datestruct value="1848"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct>, the old station was converted into a goods depot. The railway works here cover a vast extent of ground on either side of the main line, and give employment to a large number of hands.   Mr. T. Miller, in his <QUOTE>Picturesque Sketches of London</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>), writes :-- <QUOTE>Wandsworth had set out in good earnest to reach Lambeth, and would soon have been near the <num value="9">Nine</num> Elms Station had not Government stopped

 its career by stepping in between them at Battersea Fields.</QUOTE> 
   <P>We   have already spoken of the glass-works, which formed <num value="1">one</num> of the centres of industry for which Vauxhall was formerly celebrated; another scene of industry in our own time was Messrs. Price's candle factory, which was for many years <num value="1">one</num> of the most interesting   sights in London. There were formerly <num value="2">two</num> establishments in connection with the firm, known as Belmont, at Vauxhall, and Sherwood, in York Road, Battersea; the latter, however, which was by far the largest, alone remains, and the large corrugated iron roofs of the buildings are doubtless well known to the reader who is in the habit of passing frequently up the river.   The works cover upwards of <num value="13">thirteen</num> acres of ground, <num value="6">six</num> of which are under cover, and they give employment to about <num value="1000">one thousand</num> hands. It may be added that this factory covers the site of old York House, of which we shall have more to say presently.   The neighbourhood would appear to have been, at the early part of the present century, pretty well supplied with inns and taverns; at all events, a manuscript list, dated about <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, enumerates <QUOTE>The   Bull,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Elephant and <pb id="P.469" n="469"> Castle,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Bridge House,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Vauxhall Tap,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The White Lion,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The King's Arms,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Lion and Lamb,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The White Bear,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Fox,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The <num value="3">Three</num> Merry Boys,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Red Cow,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Bull's Head,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Coach and Horses,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Henry VIII.,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Crown,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Ship,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Red Lion,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Nag's Head,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>The Wine Vaults.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Battersea, or Patrick's-eye, is said to have taken its name from St. Patrick or St. Peter, because in ancient days it belonged to the Abbey of St. Peter at Westminster. In Domesday Book, A.D. <datestruct value="1078"><year reg="1078">1078</year></datestruct>, it is recorded that <QUOTE>S. Peter of Westminster holds Patricesy.</QUOTE> The manor, with the advowson, was granted by King Stephen to the abbot and convent of Westminster; but at the Dissolution they again reverted into the hands of the Crown. Charles I., however, granted them   to Sir Oliver St. John, ancestor of Lord Bolingbroke, from whose family they passed by sale to that of Lord Spencer. By the ancient custom of this manor lands were to descend to younger sons; but if there are no sons, they are divided equally among the daughters. 
   <P>Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke and Lord St. John of Battersea, died here in <datestruct value="1751--"><year reg="1751">1751</year></datestruct>. Hughson,

 in his <QUOTE>Circuit of London,</QUOTE> writes:-- <QUOTE>The family seat was a venerable structure, which contained <num value="40">forty</num> rooms on a floor; the greatest part of the house was pulled down in <datestruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct>.   On the site of the demolished part are erected a horizontal airmill and malt distillery. The part left standing forms a dwelling-house; <num value="1">one</num> of the parlours, fronting the Thames, is lined with cedar, beautifully inlaid, and was the favourite study of Pope, the scene of many a literary conversation between him and his friend Bolingbroke. The mill, now [<datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>] used for grinding malt for the distillery, was built for the grinding of linseed. The design was taken from that of another, on a smaller scale, constructed at Margate.   Its height, from the foundation, is <num value="140">one hundred and forty</num> feet, the diameter of the conical part <num value="54">fifty-four</num> feet at the base and fortyfive at the top. The outer part consists of ninetysix shutters, <num value="80">eighty</num> feet high and <num value="9">nine</num> inches broad, which, by the pulling of a rope, open and shut in the manner of Venetian blinds.   In the inside, the main shaft of the mill is the centre of a large circle formed by the sails, which consist of <num value="96">ninety-six</num> double planks, placed perpendicularly, and of the same height as the planks that form the <pb id="P.470" n="470"> shutters. The wind rushing through the openings of these shutters acts with great power upon the sails, and, when it blows fresh, turns the mill with prodigious rapidity; but this may be moderated in an instant, by lessening the apertures between the shutters, which is effected, like the entire stopping of the mill, as before observed, by the pulling of a rope. In this mill are <num value="6">six</num> pairs of stones, to which <num value="2">two</num> pairs more may be added.   On the site of the garden and terrace have been erected extensive bullock houses, capable of holding <num value="650">650</num> bullocks, fed with the grains from the distillery mixed with meal.</QUOTE> The above-mentioned mill (see page <num value="468">468</num>) has long been removed, or, at any rate, considerably altered, and a flour-mill now occupies the site. John Timbs, in his <QUOTE>Curiosities of London,</QUOTE> tells us that the mill resembled a gigantic packing-case, which gave rise to an odd story, that <QUOTE>when the Emperor of Russia was in England he took a fancy to Battersea Church, and determined to carry it off to Russia, and had this large packing-case made for it; but as the inhabitants refused to let the church be carried away, the case remained on the spot where it was deposited.</QUOTE> 
   <P>When Sir Richard Phillips took, in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, his <QUOTE>Morning Walk from London to Kew,</QUOTE> he found still standing a small portion of the family mansion in which Lord Bolingbroke had been born, and, like Hughson before him, he tells us that it had been converted into a mill and distillery, though a small oak parlour had been carefully preserved. In this room   Pope is said to have written his <QUOTE>Essay on Man;</QUOTE> and in Bolingbroke's time the house was the constant resort of Swift, Arbuthnot, Thomson, and David Mallet, and all the cotemporary <hi rend=italics>literati</hi> of English society. The oak room was always called <QUOTE>Pope's Parlour,</QUOTE> and doubtless was the very identical room which was assigned to the poet whenever he came from London, or from Twickenham, as a guest to Battersea. 
   <P>Happening to inquire for some ancient inhabitant of the place, Sir Richard was introduced to a chatty and intelligent old woman, a Mrs. Gillard, who told him that she well remembered Lord Bolingbroke's face; that he used to ride out every day in his chariot, and had a black patch on his cheek, with a large wart over <num value="1">one</num> of his eyebrows. She was then but a child, but she was taught always to regard him as a great man. As, however, he spent but little in the place, and gave little away, he was not much regarded by the people of Battersea. Sir Richard mentioned to the old dame the names of many of Bolingbroke's friends and associates; but she could remember nothing of any of them except Mallet, whom   she used often to see walking about the village, wrapped up in his own thoughts, whilst he was a visitor at <QUOTE>the great house.</QUOTE> The cedarpanelled room in Bolingbroke House is still very scrupulously preserved; its windows still overlook the Thames, from which the house is separated by a lawn.   In <num value="3">three</num> of the chambers up-stairs the ceilings are ornamented with   stucco-work, and have in their centres oval-shaped oil-paintings on allegorical subjects. 
   <P>Henry St. John was born at Battersea in <datestruct value="1678--"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct>, and was educated at Eton, where he became acquainted with Sir Robert Walpole, and where a rivalship was commenced which lasted through life. At an early age he was distinguished for his talents, fascinating manners, and remarkable personal beauty; and he left college only to continue a course of the wildest profligacy.   On his elevation to the peerage, in <datestruct value="1712--"><year reg="1712">1712</year></datestruct>, his father's congratulation on his new   honours was something of the oddest:-- <QUOTE>Ah, Harry!</QUOTE> said he, <QUOTE>I ever said you would be   <hi rend=italics>hanged</hi>, but now I find you will be <hi rend=italics>beheaded</hi></QUOTE> <num value="3">Three</num> years later, having been impeached for high treason, Bolingbroke fled to Calais; and shortly afterwards, by invitation of Charles Stuart, he visited him at Lorraine, and accepted the post of his Secretary of State, which caused his impeachment and attainder.   In <datestruct value="1723--"><year reg="1723">1723</year></datestruct> he was permitted to return home, and his estates were restored to him; but the House of Lords was still closed against him. In <datestruct value="1736--"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct> he again visited France, and resided there until the death of his father, when he retired to the family seat here for the rest of his life. He died of a cancer in the face in <datestruct value="1751--"><year reg="1751">1751</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>Lord Bolingbroke wrote several works which have handed his name down to posterity. During his life there appeared a <QUOTE>Letter to Swift,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Representation,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>His Case,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Dissertations upon Parties,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Remarks on the History of England,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Letters on the Spirit of Patriotism,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>On the Idea of a Patriot King,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>On the State of Parties at the Accession of George I.</QUOTE> His correspondence, state papers, essays, &amp;c., were subsequently published in a collected form by David Mallet, his lordship's literary legatee. 
   <P>Lord Marchmont was living with Lord Bolingbroke, at Battersea, when he discovered that Mr. Alien, of Bath, had printed <num value="500">500</num> copies of the <QUOTE>Essay on a Patriot King</QUOTE> from the copy which Bolingbroke had presented to Pope-<num value="6">six</num> copies only were printed. Thereupon, we are told, Lord Marchmont sent a man for the whole cargo, and they were brought out in a wagon, and the books burned on the lawn in the presence of Lord Bolingbroke. <pb id="P.471" n="471"> 
   <P>The history of Lord Bolingbroke may be read in his epitaph in the parish church close by, which is as follows :-- <QUOTE>Here lies Henry St. John, in the reign of Queen Anne Secretary of War, Secretary of State, and Viscount Bolingbroke; in the days of King George I. and King George II. something more and better. His attachment to Queen Anne exposed him to a long and severe persecution; he bore it with firmness of mind.   He passed the latter part of his life at home, the enemy of no national party, the friend of no faction; distinguished under the cloud of proscription, which had not been entirely taken off, by zeal to maintain the liberty and to restore the ancient prosperity of Great Britain.</QUOTE> 
   <P> <QUOTE>In this manner,</QUOTE> says Oliver Goldsmith, in his life of this distinguished man, <QUOTE>lived and died Lord Bolingbroke; ever active, never depressed; ever pursuing Fortune, and   as constantly disappointed by her. In whatever light we view his character, we shall find him an object rather more proper for our wonder than our imitation; more to be feared than esteemed, and gaining our admiration without our love. His ambition ever aimed at the summit of power, and nothing seemed capable of satisfying his immoderate desires but the liberty of governing all things without a rival.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Of Lord Bolingbroke's genius as a philosopher, the same author observes that <QUOTE>his aims were equally great and extensive. Unwilling to submit to any authority, he entered the fields of science with a thorough contempt of all that had been established before him, and seemed willing to think everything wrong that he might show his faculty in the reformation. It might have been better for his quiet as a man if he had been content to act a subordinate character in the State; and it had certainly been better for his memory as a writer if he had aimed at doing less than he attempted. As a novelist, therefore, Lord Bolingbroke, by having endeavoured at too much, seems to have done nothing; but as a political writer, few can equal and none can exceed him.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Tindal, the historian, confesses that St. John was occasionally, perhaps, the best political writer that ever appeared   in   England; whilst Lord Chesterfield tells us that, until he read Bolingbroke's <QUOTE>Letters on Patriotism,</QUOTE> and his <QUOTE>Idea of a Patriot King,</QUOTE> he <QUOTE>did not know all the extent and powers of the English language. Whatever subject,</QUOTE> continues his lordship, <QUOTE>Lord Bolingbroke speaks or writes upon, he adorns with the most splendid eloquence; not a studied or laboured eloquence, but such a flowing happiness of diction, which (from   care, perhaps, at <num value="1">first</num>) is become so familiar to him   that even his most familiar conversations, if taken down in writing, would bear the press, without the least correction either as to method or style.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Among the residents of this village was Sir William Batten, the friend of Pepys, who records in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> <datestruct VALUE="1660-01-30"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=30>30th</day>, <year reg=1660>1660</year></datestruct>-<num value="1">1</num>, how Lady Batten and his own wife went hence to see the bodies of Cromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw hanged and buried at Tyburn. 
   <P><LEMMA id="lemma.471.1">York House</LEMMA>, which stood near the water-side, on the spot now occupied by Price's Candle Factory, and is kept in remembrance by York Road, is supposed to have been built about the year <datestruct value="1475"><year reg="1475">1475</year></datestruct> by Lawrence Booth, Bishop of Durham, and by him annexed to the see of York, of which he was afterwards archbishop, as a residence for himself and his successors when they had occasion to be near the Court. 
   <P>Lysons speaks of the house as standing in his time (the end of the last century), and states that it was formerly an occasional residence of the archbishops; but that for more than a century it had been occupied only by tenants. <QUOTE>Tradition, with its usual fondness for appropriation,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>speaks of Wolsey's residence there; and the room is yet shown in which he entertained Anne Boleyn; but besides the improbability that Wolsey --who, when he was Archbishop of York, lived in as great and sometimes in greater state than the king himself, and was owner of <num value="2">two</num> most magnificent palaces--should reside in a house which would not have contained half his retinue, it is well known that these entertainments were given at York House, Whitehall.</QUOTE> 
   <P>When Archbishop Holgate was committed to the Tower by Queen Mary, in q<num value="553">553</num>, the officers who were employed to apprehend him rifled his house at Battersea, and took away from thence <QUOTE><measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure> of gold coin, <measure value="1600l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1600">1,600</num></measure> ounces of plate, a mitre of fine gold, with   <num value="2">two</num> pendants set round about the sides and midst with very fine-pointed diamonds, sapphires, and balists; and all the plain, with other good stones and pearls; and the pendants in like manner, weighing   <num value="125">125</num> ounces; some very valuable rings; a serpent's tongue set in a standard of silver gilt, and graven; the archbishop's seal in silver; and his signet, an antique in gold.</QUOTE> Holgate was afterwards deprived of the archbishopric of York, to which he was never restored. 
   <P>Of the structural details of the <LEMMA id="lemma.472.1">ancient parish church of Battersea</LEMMA>, dedicated to St. Mary, little or nothing is now known, further than that it is said to have been a <QUOTE>twin sister</QUOTE> church to that <pb id="P.472" n="472"> of Chelsea on the opposite side of the river, which it much resembled.   The edifice was rebuilt with brick in the middle of the last century, and in a style quite worthy of that era.   It is an utterly unecclesiastical and unsightly structure, without aisles or chancel, and almost defies description.   A church had stood on the same site for centuries; but the present edifice dates only from <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct>, when it was erected at a cost of <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure>.   The tower is surmounted by a low, heavy-looking octagonal spire, and contains a clock and <num value="8">eight</num> bells, At the east end is a recess for the communion-table, above which is a central window in <num value="3">three</num> divisions.   The painted glass in this window, which was replaced from the old church, contains portraits of   Henry VII., his grandmother, Margaret Beauchamp, and Queen Elizabeth, together with many enrichments and several coats-of-arms.   Most of the old monuments were replaced against the walls of the side galleries. Against the south wall is 
<LEMMA id="lemma.472.2">a monument to an heroic person, Sir Edward   Wynter</LEMMA>, who   seems to   have   outstripped   the boldest knights of chivalry by his exploits, if we may take the epitaph literally:--

     <P>Among the memorials of the St. Johns is that of Lord Bolingbroke, already mentioned, and of his <num value="2">second</num> wife, Mary Clara des Champs de   Marcilly, Marchioness de Villette. This monument, which. is of grey and white marble, was executed by Roubiliac.   The upper part displays an urn with drapery, surmounted by the viscount's arms, and the lower portion records the characters of the deceased, flanked by their medallions in profile, in bas-relief. Another monument commemorates the descent and preferments of Oliver   St. John, Viscount Grandison, who was the <num value="1">first</num> of his family that settled at Battersea. He died in <datestruct value="1630--"><year reg="1630">1630</year></datestruct>.

     <P>The parish register dates from the year <datestruct value="1559"><year reg="1559">1559</year></datestruct>.  In <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>-<num value="8">8</num> the interior of the church underwent a partial restoration, being re-paved and re-seated with open benches, in place of the old-fashioned pews. 
    <P>Of late years several other churches and chapels have been erected in the parish. Christ Church, at South Battersea, is an elegant Decorated structure; it was built by subscription, and opened in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>.   St. Mark's, Battersea Rise, is of the Geometric Middle-pointed style of architecture; it was built from the designs of Mr. W.

    <P>St. George's Church, in Lower Wandsworth Road, dates its erection from <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>; it is a large edifice of the Pointed style of architecture in vogue in the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century, and was built from the designs of  Mr. Blore. It was enlarged and repaired in <datestruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>There are National and British and Foreign  Schools for boys, girls, and infants. The National  School, in High Street, was founded and endowed for <num value="20">twenty</num> boys in <datestruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct>, by Sir Walter St. John,  Bart.; it was rebuilt and enlarged in <datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>, and now affords instruction to about <num value="300">300</num> boys.   Christ  Church Schools are neat buildings in the Grove  Road, and were erected at a cost of <measure value="4800l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4800">4,800</num></measure>. 
    <P>The Normal School of the National Society, known as St. John's College--for the training of young men who are intended to become schoolmasters in schools connected with the Church of England-owes its origin to Dr. J. P. Kay and Mr. E. C. Tufnell, assistant Poor-law   Commissioners. These gentlemen, with a view of making an effort for the production of a better description of schoolmasters than had hitherto generally been met with, visited Holland, Prussia, Switzerland, Paris, and other places, for the purpose of examining the operations of the establishments projected by Pestalozzi, De Fellenberg, and other enlightened promoters of the education of the poor; and the result of their observations was a desire and hope to establish in this country a Normal School, <QUOTE>for imparting to young men that due amount of knowledge, and training them in those habits of simplicity and earnestness, which might render them useful instructors to the poor.</QUOTE> With this view, they were led to select <QUOTE>a spacious manor-house close to the Thames at Battersea, chiefly on account of the very frank and cordial welcome with which the suggestion of their plan was received by the vicar, the Hon. and Rev. R.

The institution was <num value="1">first</num> put in operation at the commencement of <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>; and it continued under the direction of Dr. Kay and Mr. Tufnell, supported by their private means, and conducted in its various departments of instruction and industrial labour by tutors and superintendents appointed by them, until the close of the year <datestruct value="1843"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>, when the establishment was put on a foundation of permanency by the directors transferring it into the hands of the National Society. Several Continental modes of instruction had been adopted by Dr. Kay and Mr. Tufnell, such as Mulhauser's method of writing, Wilhelm's method of singing, Dupuis' method of drawing, &amp;c.; and the results of their benevolent experiment were so satisfactory, that a grant of <measure value="2200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2200">2,200</num></measure> for the extension and improvement of the premises was made to them by the Committee of Council on Education, which grant was transferred to the National Society, and forthwith expended in the requisite alterations.   New dormitories, a dininghall, lavatories, &amp;c., were then built; and in the early part of <datestruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct> a large new class-room was erected, and filled with every kind of apparatus for the use of the students.   The institution is supported by the National Society's special fund for providing schoolmasters for the manufacturing and mining districts.   Only young men are now received as students; and the usual term of training is generally <num value="1">one</num> year and a half. The general number of scholars is from <num value="80">eighty</num> to <num value="100">one hundred</num>. 
    <P>Another invaluable institution in Battersea is the  Royal Freemasons' Girls' School.   This institution was founded   in <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>, and was originally located in St. George's Fields;<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="350">350</num>.</NOTE> but was a few years ago removed to its present site on St. John's  Hill, Battersea Rise. It was established for the purpose of educating and maintaining the daughters of poor or deceased Freemasons.   The school, which stands near Clapham Junction Station, and close by the side of the railway, is a red-brick building, of Gothic architecture, and was erected in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, from the designs of Mr. Philip Hardwicke; it is chiefly noticeable for its great central clocktower, and watch-towers at the corners. 
    <P>At Battersea Rise, which forms the north-western extremity of Clapham   Common, many pleasant villas and superior houses have been built; this being <QUOTE>a most desirable situation and respectable neighbourhood.</QUOTE> Here the <num value="1">first</num> Lord Auckland had a suburban villa, where he used to entertain his political friends, Pitt, Wilberforce, and others.

    <P><num value="3">Three</num> bridges communicate across the river with  Chelsea: the <num value="1">first</num> is a handsome structure, built on the suspension principle, and called the Victoria  Bridge.

In <datestruct value="1618--"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct> the earl sold the ferry to William Blake, who also had a local interest in Chelsea, inasmuch as he owned Chelsea Park, which had once belonged to Sir Thomas More, and was at <num value="1">one</num> time known as the Sand Hills. This <pb id="P.475" n="475"> park was sold by Blake to the Earl of Middlesex in <datestruct value="1620--"><year reg="1620">1620</year></datestruct>.

In the year <datestruct value="1762"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct> the nephew obtained an Act of Parliament, under which he sold the manorial property to the trustees of John, Earl Spencer. In <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct> Earl Spencer obtained an Act of Parliament which empowered him to build the present bridge at his own expense at the ferry, and to secure land for the approaches. The tolls named in the Act are <num value="1">one</num> halfpenny for footpassengers, as at the present time, and fourpence for a cart drawn by <num value="1">one</num> horse, or double the toll now   charged.   The framers of the Act appear to have contemplated the possibility of the bridge 
<FIGURE id="Fig.475" n="2000.14.0175"><HEAD>The Tropical Gardens, Battersea Park.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 being only a fragile structure, as special powers are granted to the earl to sue watermen injuring it by boat or vessel. Provision is also made on behalf of the public by a clause which enacts that in the event of a tempest or unforeseen accident rendering the bridge <QUOTE>dangerous or impracticable,</QUOTE> the earl shall provide a convenient ferry, charging the same tolls as on the bridge. The bridge, however, was not constructed until several years after the Act of Parliament had been obtained, and between   the years <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg=1765>1765</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1771--"><year reg=1771>1771</year></datestruct> it is on record that the ferry produced an average rental of     <measure value="42l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="42">42</num></measure> per annum.   In the latter year Lord   Spencer associated with himself <num value="17">seventeen</num> gentlemen, each of whom was to pay <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> as a consideration for the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> share in the ferry, and all the advantages conferred on the earl by the Act of <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct>.   They were also made responsible for a further payment of <measure value="900l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="900">900</num></measure> each towards the construction of a bridge.   A contract was entered into with Messrs. Phillips and <pb id="P.476" n="476"> Holland to build the bridge for <measure value="10500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10500">10,500</num></measure>.   The works were at once commenced, and by the end of <datestruct value="1771--"><year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct> it was opened for foot passengers, and in the following year it was available for carriage traffic. Money had to be laid out in the formation of approach roads, so that at the end of <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct> the total amount expended was <measure value="15662l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="15662">15,662</num></measure>. 
   <P>For many years the proprietors realised only a small return upon their capital, repairs and improvements absorbing nearly all the receipts. In the severe winter of <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct> considerable damage was done to the bridge by reason of the accumulated ice becoming attached to the piles, and drawing them on the rise of the tide; and in the last <num value="3">three</num> years of the eighteenth century no dividends were distributed. In <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct> <num value="1">one</num> side of the bridge was lighted with oil lamps, and it was the only wooden bridge across the Thames which at that time possessed   such   accommodation.   In <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct> the dangerous wooden railing was replaced by a handrail of iron; and in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct> the bridge was lighted with gas, the pipes being brought over from Chelsea, although Battersea remained unlighted by gas for several years afterwards. 
   <P>Further structural improvements were made from time to time, <num value="1">one</num> of which consisted of laying the bridge with a flooring of cast-iron plates, on which the metal of the roadway rests. At various times, too, the proprietors have expended considerable sums of money in making a road on Wandsworth Common, and, in conjunction with Battersea parish, in improving ways of approach to the bridge. The proprietors, moreover, have often expressed their willingness to contribute towards some alteration of the water-way of the bridge for the benefit of the public.   In this, however, it was but reasonable that they should expect to be joined by the Conservators of the Thames, or others interested in the improvement. This expectation not being realised, they declined   to bear the whole cost. Until <datestruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct> the bridge remained in the hands of the descendants or friends of the original proprietors.   In that year, however, the bridge came into the possession of the Albert Bridge Company, under their Act of Incorporation; and it was by this company, as stated above, that the recent improvements were carried out, the same being made obligatory by that Act. 
    <P>The extreme length of the bridge is <num value="726">726</num> feet, and its width <num value="24">twenty-four</num> feet, including the <num value="2">two</num> pathways. It originally consisted of <num value="19">nineteen</num> openings, varying from <num value="31">thirty-one</num> feet in the centre to <num value="16">sixteen</num> feet at the ends, the piers being formed of groups of timber piles. There is a clear headway of <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet under the centre span at Trinity highwater. The bridge does not cross the river in a direct line, but is built upon a slight curve in plan --the convexity being on the upper or western side. The alterations above mentioned comprise the widening of the water-way at <num value="2">two</num> points in the bridge, for which purpose <num value="4">four</num> of the spans have been converted into <num value="2">two</num>. The centre opening is now <num value="75">seventy-five</num> feet wide, with the same headway as before. The other widening of the water-way is at a point near the northern or Chelsea end. By these alterations greater facilities for river traffic have been afforded, while the old bridge has been considerably strengthened by means of the iron girders and extra piles which have been added to it. 
   <P>A quarter of a century ago the locality then known as Battersea Fields was <num value="1">one</num> of the darkest and dreariest spots in the suburbs of London. A flat and unbroken wilderness of some <num value="300">300</num> acres, it was the resort of costermongers and <QUOTE>roughs,</QUOTE> and those prowling vagabonds who call themselves <QUOTE>gipsies.</QUOTE> The week-day scenes here were bad enough; but on Sundays they were positively disgraceful, and to a great extent the police were powerless, for the place was a sort of <QUOTE>no man's land,</QUOTE> on which ruffianism   claimed to riot uncontrolled by any other authority than its own will. Pugilistic encounters, dog-fights, and the rabble coarseness of a country fair in its worst aspect were <QUOTE>as common as blackberries in the autumn.</QUOTE> But at length the <QUOTE>strong arm of the law</QUOTE> interfered, and the weekly <QUOTE>fair</QUOTE> --if such it might be called--was abolished by the magistrates in <datestruct VALUE="1852-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>Duels have sometimes been fought in Battersea  Fields, the lonely character of the neighbourhood causing it to be selected for this special purpose.  <num value="1">One</num> of the most noted of these <QUOTE>affairs of honour</QUOTE> took place in <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>.   In that year the Duke of  Wellington got into <QUOTE>hot water</QUOTE> for the part he had taken in the passing of the Catholic Relief  Bill. Abuse fell upon him fast and furious; and the young Earl of Winchilsea-<num value="1">one</num> of the leaders of the anti-Catholic party-went so far as to publish a violent attack on his personal character.  The duke having vainly endeavoured to induce the earl to retract his charges, sent him a challenge, and the combatants met in Battersea Fields on the <datestruct VALUE="-03-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, but fortunately separated without injury to either. Lord Winchilsea, after escaping the duke's shot, fired in the air, and then tendered the apology which ought to have been made at the outset. 
    <P>On the river-side the monotony of blackguardism was somewhat relieved by a glaring tavern, known <pb id="P.477" n="477"> as the <QUOTE>Red House</QUOTE> --but more frequently called by cockneys the <QUOTE>Red-&lsquo;us,</QUOTE> as every reader of <QUOTE>Sketches by Boz</QUOTE> will remember--in the grounds of which pigeon-shooting was carried on by the cream   of society till superseded by the more fashionable Hurlingham. In Colburn's <QUOTE>Kalendar of Amusements</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>), we read that <QUOTE>pigeonshooting is carried on to a great extent in the neighbourhood of London; but the  <Q>Red House</Q>  at Battersea appears to take the lead in the quantity and quality of this sport, inasmuch as the crack shots about London assemble there to determine matches of importance, and it not unfrequently occurs that not a single bird escapes the shooter.</QUOTE> 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.477.1">Battersea Reach</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>The <QUOTE>Red House</QUOTE> has been the winning-post of many a boat-race.   In the <QUOTE>Good Fellows' Calendar</QUOTE> of <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>, we read that, on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct> in the previous year, <QUOTE>Mr. Kean, the performer,</QUOTE> gave a prize wherry, which was <QUOTE>rowed for by <num value="7">seven</num> pairs of oars. The <num value="1">first</num> heat was from Westminster Bridge round a boat moored near Lawn Cottage, and   down to the  <Q>Red House</Q>  at Battersea.</QUOTE> The other heats, too, all ended here; and the Calendar adds that, though Westminster Bridge was crowded with spectators, the <QUOTE>Red House</QUOTE> was <QUOTE>the place where all the prime of l   life lads assembled,</QUOTE> and describes the fun of the afternoon and evening in amusing terms. 
   <P>It is said that about <num value="50">fifty</num> yards west of this spot Caesar crossed the Thames, following the retreating Britons; but the fact is questioned. Nevertheless, Sir Richard Phillips, in his <QUOTE>Morning's Walk from London to Kew,</QUOTE> tells us that he had more than once surveyed the ford, from the <QUOTE>Red House</QUOTE> to the opposite bank, near the site of Ranelagh. <QUOTE>At ordinary low water,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>a shoal of gravel not <num value="3">three</num> feet deep, and broad enough for <num value="10">ten</num> men to walk abreast, extends across the river, except on the Surrey side, where it has been deepened by raising ballast. Indeed, the causeway from the south bank may yet be traced at low water, so that this was doubtless a ford to the peaceful Britons, across which the British army retreated before the Romans, and across which they were doubtless followed by Caesar and the Roman legions.   The event was pregnant with such consequences to the fortunes of these islands that the spot deserves the record of a monument, which ought to be preserved from age to age, as long as the veneration due to antiquity is cherished among us.</QUOTE> 
   <P>As lately as <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct> Battersea Fields formed, as we have said, a dreary waste of open country. A <QUOTE>Metropolitan Guide</QUOTE> of that year speaks of them as <QUOTE>destined to be shortly converted into a park, with an ornamental lake, walks, and parterres, for the recreation and enjoyment of the people.</QUOTE> The fact is, the disgraceful scenes to be witnessed here had become such a glaring scandal that urgent measures had long been in contemplation for its suppression. Happily, just then the demand for open spaces in the outskirts of the metropolis had taken firm hold of public attention, and about this time these fields, instead of being handed over to speculative builders, were devoted to the purposes of a public park.   The <QUOTE>Red House,</QUOTE> with its shooting-grounds and adjacent premises, was purchased by the Government for <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>; and, under the Metropolitan Board of Works, in the course of a few years, the wilderness was converted into a pleasant garden, and now Battersea Park ranks among the very <num value="1">first</num> of those health and pleasure resorts which Londoners prize so highly and justly.   It is now   <num value="1">one</num> of the prettiest of London parks, and every year adds charms to its many attractions, the choicest of which, perhaps, is the Acclimatisation Garden, which may be said to flourish here not far from   the heart of the metropolis. In Battersea Park palm-trees actually grow in the open air--not under glass cases, as at Kew: indeed, this park is no mean or contemptible rival to Kew Gardens. 
   <P>The park, which was opened to the public in <datestruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct>, contains about <num value="185">185</num> acres ornamentally laid out with trees, shrubs, flower-plots, and a sheet of water.   For the land <measure value="246500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="246500">246,500</num></measure> was paid, and the laying-out made the total cost amount to <measure value="312000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="312000">312,000</num></measure>.   The Avenue is <num value="1">one</num> of the principal features, and forms the chief promenade of the park. The trees are English elms. <QUOTE>To rightly appreciate Battersea Park,</QUOTE> observes a writer, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>it must not be approached in a hurry.   Its numerous beauties are worth much more than a bird's-eye view.   And here we would parenthetically remark that a vast amount of good has been done towards the cultivation and encouragement of flowers in our parks within the last <num value="2">two</num> decades   . ...   But the palm-trees we would speak of do not flourish in the more aristocratic parks of the metropolis--they have found a home over the water in Battersea Park, the access to which is easy in all directions. Steamers ply to it at all hours of the day; but we prefer to approach it from quaint old Chelsea and on a bright Sunday in summer. 
   <P>Passing among a wealth of vegetation and pavilions which seem to be devoted to the accommodation of the cricket-playing fraternity, a short walk brings us, after deriving much necessary <pb id="P.478" n="478"> assistance from finger-posts, to the tropical garden; and a pleasanter sight we have not seen for many a long day. Here is the Acclimatisation Garden of London; and if we may believe our own eyes, we are certainly not far behind the brilliant city of Paris, as regards the flourishing condition of these out-of-door palms and rare flowering shrubs. Nearly all the books of travel we know are recalled by the charmingly varied character of the foliage and the quaint peculiarities of the plants. Here is a noble palm, here an aloe, here an enormous nettle-leaved shrub, here a plant with prickles starting up in an angry and porcupine manner all over the leaves, here rare specimens of Alpine flowers, and everywhere beds of brilliant colour artistically arranged. 
   <P>It certainly would appear that it is the fashion now-a-days to frame in flower-beds with the rare variations which now   exist of the <foreign lang=la>Sempervivum echeria</foreign> and saxifrage plant.   Many of these are best explained as an idealised version of the wellknown house-leek, and the compact little bosses of plants, though   over-stiff, perhaps, to some tastes, make an excellent and compact bordering for flower-beds.   They are, no doubt, extremely fashionable, as Kew testifies, and all the largest landscape gardens in the kingdom.   No visitor to the Battersea Park Gardens will fail to notice what great attention is now paid to the foliage of plants in contradistinction to the bloom   or flower.   Plants with grey and brown leaves and sage-green leaves are preferred to bright blossoms; geraniums are encouraged with leaves painted as brilliantly as a chromatrope; variations of the 
<foreign lang=la>Perilla nankinensis</foreign>, or Chinese nettle, are everywhere seen. And, in order to increase the strange effect of these quaker-like beds, it is the fashion to intermix the plants with paths and mazes of very finely-powdered gravel or silver sand. . . . It is a charming sight, this tropical garden; and amateur or professional gardeners--to say nothing of general lovers of nature--may well study it.</QUOTE>

   <P>Here the visitor may see, on a small scale, the flora of the Alpine region as well as of the tropics. These and the other beauties of the park are thus described with   minute accuracy   in <QUOTE>Saturday Afternoon Rambles:</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>Here is the lake, with its fringe of aquatic plants and its beautifully-wooded island, and studded with water-fowl from various latitudes, from   the sub-Arctic   and   sub-tropical regions. ... Here are Japanese teal, Egyptian geese, South African and Buenos Ayres ducks. Here also are ducks from the far north of Europe, partial to a winter temperature, but still staying on the Battersea Park waters for the whole year round. Among the self-invited guests on this lake is a colony of moor-hens, who  <Q>make themselves at home</Q>  along with widgeon, teal, and Muscovy, and pintail ducks.   Here the moor-hen has forgotten the sound of the gun, and her behaviour before Saturday afternoon visitors is as tame as that of the familiar Dorking hen. . . . How beautiful is that island yonder, with pendulous trees drooping   over its margin! The ground seems well clothed with tall grasses and low brushwood.   It should afford a good home and abundant cover for the water-fowl.   Doubtless, the swans have good landing-places, a plentiful supply of dead rushes, coarse grass twigs, and other nest-making materials. As we stand looking at the lake, there comes rowing up to us, past the water-lilies, a proud maternal white swan, with quite a flotilla of little mouse-coloured cygnets in her wake- 
               <QUOTE REND=blockquote> The swan, with arched neck,         Between her white wings soaring proudly, rows         Her state with oary feet.</QUOTE>
There are black swans from Australia here as well. Yonder goes a squadron of ducks, making an arrow-headed track in the water. They sail round the headland in beautiful order, and disappear, uttering strange shrieks.   But our afternoon is waning.   We must take our leave of the subtropical and sub-Arctic scenery at Battersea Park. To what other horticultural grounds, be they public or private, around London shall we go for such sights as these?   Here in this park--not in any huge glass conservatory or  <QUOTE>Wardian</QUOTE>  case, but under the open sky--are living side by side the Arctic saxifrage, the English rose, the tropical palm, and the desert cactus.   .        . Then let no Londoner remain any longer unacquainted with this wonderful vegetation at Battersea.   Let him give at least <num value="2">two</num> afternoons of the summer to these sub-tropical and Alpine gardens.   None the less will he enjoy the purely English landscape scenery. The more, too, will he delight in the vegetable life and scenery of the zone which lies between these sub-Arctic and sub-tropical regions at Battersea.</QUOTE>

   <P>Close by the park are some blocks of houses, erected by the Victoria Dwellings' Association as homes for the working classes.   The buildings, which were opened in <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>, were intended as models of the dwellings for artisans and labourers, to replace the habitations condemned in various parts of the metropolis under the Act of <datestruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>At a short distance eastward of the park are the reservoirs and engine-house of the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company.   The reservoirs cover nearly eighteen acres of ground; and the steam-engines have sufficient power to force the <pb id="P.479" n="479"> water through perpendicular iron tubes to the height of <num value="175">175</num> feet, by which means it is raised sufficiently to supply the inhabitants of Brixton and other elevated places. 
   <P>Some portion of the ground immediately contiguous to the park is still cultivated as marketgardens; but before the formation of the park, and the recent railway extensions near Clapham Junction Station, some hundreds of acres were devoted to that purpose. The gardens here were long noted for producing the earliest and best asparagus in the neighbourhood of London.   Indeed, that this parish at <num value="1">one</num> time enjoyed the reputation of being a place for early fruit and vegetables is shown by the following satirical lines on air-balloons, from the <hi rend=italics>Spirit of the Times</hi> for <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct> : 
        <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Gardeners in shoals from Battersea shall run 
          <L>To raise their kindlier hot-beds in the sun.</QUOTE>
The produce of these gardens was likewise referred to in the addresses of the candidates at the mock elections of the <QUOTE>Mayor of Garratt,</QUOTE> in the neighbouring parish of Wandsworth, as we shall presently see. 
   <P>In the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> and   eighteenth   centuries, whilst its neighbour Vauxhall was acquiring fame in consequence of the glass manufactured there, Battersea was celebrated for its enamelled ware, which still fetches good prices, although the manufacture has died out. 
   <P>But Battersea has other claims to immortality: in spite of the claims of Burton and Edinburgh, there can be little doubt, if Fuller is a trustworthy historian, that <num value="1">one</num> of the ozier-beds of the riverside here was the cradle of bottled ale.   The story is thus circumstantially told in <QUOTE>The Book of Anecdote:</QUOTE> 
   <P> <QUOTE>Alexander Nowell, Dean of St. Paul's and Master of Westminster School in the reign of Queen Mary, was a supporter of  <Q> the new opinions,</Q>  and also an excellent angler.   But, writes Fuller, while Nowell was catching of fishes, Bishop Bonner was after catching of Nowell, and would certainly have sent him to the Tower if he could have caught him, as doubtless he would have done had not a good merchant of London conveyed him   away safely upon the seas. It so happened that Nowell had been fishing upon the banks of the Thames when he received the <num value="1">first</num> intimation of his danger, which was so pressing that he dared not even go back to his house to make any preparation for his flight. Like an honest angler, he had taken with him on this expedition provisions for the day, in the shape of some bread and cheese and some beer in a bottle; and on his return to London and to his own haunts he remembered that he had left these stores in a safe place upon the bank, and there he resolved to look for them. The bread and the cheese, of course, were gone; but the bottle was still there-- <Q>yet no bottle, but rather a gun: such was the sound at the opening thereof.</Q>  And this trifling circumstance, quaintly observes Fuller,  <Q>is believed to have been the origin of bottled ale in England, for casualty <hi rend=italics>(i.e</hi>. accident) is mother of more inventions than is industry.</Q> </QUOTE>

<P><LEMMA id="lemma.479.2">Wandsworth</LEMMA>, which lies immediately to   the south-west of Battersea, on the road to Kingston, is so named from the Wandle. This river, which rises near Croydon, passes through Wandsworth into the Thames under a bridge, which, if we may accept a statement in the <QUOTE>Ambulator</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>), was called <QUOTE>the sink of the country.</QUOTE> This epithet would appear, however, to apply to the bridge rather than to the river; for Izaak Walton, in his <QUOTE>Complete Angler,</QUOTE> mentions the variety of trout found in the Wandle here as marked with marbled spots like a tortoise. 
   <P>The creek at the mouth of the Wandle forms a dock for lighters and other small vessels, and on its sides are coal-wharves and stores.   Higher up the stream are extensive paper-mills, where employment is given to a large number of hands; then there are Messrs. Watney's distilleries, besides some large corn mills, dye works, match factories, starch factories, artificial manure works, copper <pb id="P.480" n="480"> mills, &amp;c. Hughson, in his <QUOTE>History of London</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>), remarks :-- <QUOTE>At the close of the last century many French refugees settled here, and established a French church, afterwards used as a Methodist meeting-house.   The art of dyeing cloth,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>has been practised at this place for more than a century.     There are likewise several considerable manufactories: <num value="1">one</num> for bolting   cloth, iron mills, calico-printing manufactories, manufactory for printing kerseymeres, for whitening and pressing stuffs, linseed-oil and white-lead mills, oil mills, vinegar works, and distilleries.</QUOTE> At the iron mills, Dr. Hughson informs us, <QUOTE>are cast shot, shells, cannon, and other implements of war; in another part the wrought iron is manufactured, and the great effect of mechanic power is exemplified in all their operations--in the splitting of iron bars of

   <P>It was upon the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, towards the end of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, that many of the French Protestants settled at Wandsworth, and engaged   in silk-dyeing, hatmaking, &amp;c.

   <P>The village of Wandsworth--if we may so term it-lies principally in a valley, between East Hill and West Hill; the High Street, which crosses the Wandle, is the main thoroughfare, leading on to Putney Heath, and thence to Kingston and Richmond, the roads branching off to those places on the summit of West Hill.

The edifice, which was completed in <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>, occupies <num value="3">three</num> sides of a quadrangle, with a chapel in the centre, and provides a home for <num value="42">forty-two</num> poor members of the company and their wives. The chief entrance to the hospital is by massive gilded gates, on which appears the motto, <QUOTE>All worship be to God only.</QUOTE> The Union Workhouse, close by, is a large brick building, with an infirmary attached; it will hold between <num value="800">800</num> and <num value="900">900</num> inmates. 
   <P>In the angle of Wandsworth Common, formed by the West-end and Crystal Palace and the South- Western Railways, on their uniting near Clapham Junction Station, stand <num value="3">three</num> important buildings, namely, the <LEMMA id="lemma.482.1">Surrey County Prison</LEMMA>, and the Royal Victoria Patriotic Asylums for Boys and for Girls. <pb id="P.482" n="482"> The Patriotic Asylum was founded and endowed by the Commissioners of the Royal Patriotic Fund, which was instituted in <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct> for the purpose of giving <QUOTE>assistance to the widows and orphans of those who fell during the Crimean and more recent wars, and to provide schools for their children.</QUOTE> Her Majesty laid the <num value="1">first</num> stone of the Asylum for Girls in <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>, and the building was erected from the designs of Mr. R. Hawkins.   The Asylum for Boys is situated some <num value="300">three hundred</num> yards distant, on East Hill.   The Surrey County Prison, or House of Correction, was erected in <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>, and covers a large extent of ground.   The various buildings are constructed chiefly of brick; and the prison is fitted with all the latest appliances for ensuring order and discipline among the inmates. 
   <P>At a short distance south of the prison, forming a conspicuous object to passengers travelling on the South-Western main line, or the Crystal Palace and West-end Railway, stood for several years the <QUOTE>Craig telescope.</QUOTE> This instrument, the largest which had up to that date been constructed, having a tube <num value="80">80</num> feet in length, shaped like a cigar, was erected on this site in the summer of <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>. The object-glass was <num value="24">24</num> inches diameter, and its focal length about <num value="76">76</num> feet, but it subsequently turned out that the optical qualities of the telescope were not equal to its imposing appearance, or the excellent manner in which it was mounted   and supported. The tube, which could be placed in almost any position for celestial observation, was supported at each end, and was slung at the side of a massive central brick tower <num value="64">64</num> feet high, while the lower end of the tube rested on a support running on a circular railway. Not fulfilling the original expectations of its proprietor, the instrument was some years ago dismantled and removed. 
   <P>Another large building on the Common is the Surrey Lunatic Asylum. It was built in <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, and consists of a centre and wings, with beds for <num value="950">950</num> inmates. Prior to the erection of this asylum, Surrey, although a metropolitan county, had not been adequately provided with accommodation for pauper lunatics--a class of sufferers whose twofold miseries must strike deeply into every benevolent heart. It is true that the royal chartered Hospital of Bethlehem is situated in the above-mentioned district; but, from its being a general hospital, its regulations for admission, as we have already shown,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="360">360</num>.</NOTE> are not such as to meet local demands; hence the provision of an establishment exclusively for the poor of the county became an important object. The site on which the new asylum stands was a portion of the Springfield Estate, in the hamlet of Garratt, formerly the seat of Mr. Henry Perkins, including <num value="96">ninety-six</num> acres of land, with the mansion and farm   buildings, which were retained for the purposes of the asylum, the reception of convalescent patients, &amp;c. 
   <P>Although the building is, in plan, Elizabethanbeing nearly in the form of the letter E-the elevation partakes of several styles.   It is built of red brick, with white stone quoins, window-dressings, stringing-courses, and parapets, the general effect of which is good; but is injured by the battlemented towers immediately uniting with the naked, unparapeted roofs of the extensive wings right and left of the centre of the design.   This portion is in the Domestic style, with pedimented roofs, and gables surmounted with Gothic finials. The principal entrance is by a small but elaborate pointed doorway, on each side of which are small windows over the doorway is a bold scroll label in masonry. This central portion is recessed, and has <num value="3">three</num> tiers of windows, with an ornamented clock in the gable, and a copper vane over the pediment. 
   <P>On either side of the centre the fagade extends with <num value="3">three</num> small windows on the ground-floor, surmounted by a window   in each of monastic character, reaching <num value="2">two</num> storeys in height, contrasting with the small windows immediately above and below them.   The flank of this portion of the building is blank, save the massive corbelled chimney.   The   whole frontage, including   the wings, is about <num value="350">350</num> feet in length.   The principal doors open into a lobby, with a groined ceiling, leading on the right to an ante and committee room, office, &amp;c., and on the left to the superintendent's private apartments. Folding-doors facing the entrance open to what is termed the grand staircase: a lofty chamber, extending the whole height of the building and about <num value="20">twenty</num> feet square, with <num value="2">two</num> tiers of corridors round <num value="3">three</num> sides of it; it is covered in with a groined roof, and   lighted   by   an   elaborately-designed lantern.   A   doorway on the ground-floor communicates with the galleries on either side, leading to the males' wards on the left, and the females' on the   right.   The <num value="1">first</num>-floor partakes of the same   character as the   ground-floor for each sex; and <num value="2">two</num> airing courts, for all classes of each sex, enclosed with walls in sunk fences, so as to admit of the patients viewing the surrounding country. At either extremity of the building, in the basements, are large groined work-rooms. The chapel is situated across the gallery on the firstfloor, and in the centre of the edifice.

The institution, which was established in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, is <num value="1">one</num> of the oldest of the kind in or near London. The industrial operations carried on here include carpentry, tailoring, shoemaking, and engineering as applied to the steamengine on the premises; also chopping firewood for bundles, and making wheel fire-lighters with resin; gardening, care of horses, &amp;c. A kindred institution to the above is the Surrey Industrial School, <QUOTE>for homeless and destitute boys not convicted of crime,</QUOTE> situated at Bridge House, on the north side of the High Street. 
   <P>Wandsworth, we may here state, occupies a foremost place in our railway annals, for here was made the commencement of our modern railways. The Surrey Iron Tramway was laid down in <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct> from Wandsworth to Croydon, and thence to Merstham: in all, about eighteen miles. The line--which was called by abbreviation a <QUOTE>tram</QUOTE> way, from   its designer, Benjamin Ou<hi rend=italics>tram</hi>-was formed in order to carry to the water-side the chalk dug out of the sides of the Surrey hills about Epsom. Upon this railroad there worked as a young man Sir Edward Banks, who, by his own ability and energy, rose to become an engineer, and the builder-though not the designer, as generally stated--of <num value="3">three</num> of our noblest metropolitan structures: Waterloo, Southwark, and London Bridges. He lies buried at Chipstead, near Merstham, in Surrey. 
<FIGURE id="Fig.483" n="2000.14.0179"><HEAD>Lines Of Rail At Clapham Junction.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
   <P>Clapham Junction Station, at the north-eastern extremity of the common, although really in Battersea parish, may be more fittingly mentioned here. The station itself, which was at <num value="1">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> of the most inconvenient, was rebuilt a few years ago; and now, with its various sidings and goods-sheds, covers several acres of ground, and is <num value="1">one</num> of the most important junctions   in   the   neighbourhood   of London, if not of Great Britain. As will be seen from the diagram which we engrave from Mr. John Airey's <QUOTE>Railway Junction Iiagrams,</QUOTE> this junction is used jointly by the London and South-Western; the London, Brighton and South Coast; the London, Chatham, and Dover; and the London and North- Western Companies. The number of trains which call at this station per day on the several lines is <num value="863">863</num>; whilst those which pass through without stopping are <num value="138">138</num>; and it is calculated that on an average about <num value="25000">25,000</num> passengers may be said to pass through Clapham Junction in every <num value="20">twenty</num>. <num value="4">four</num> hours.   In fact, this junction is the most busy railway station in England, and, perhaps, in the world. 
   <P>Wandsworth Bridge, which spans the Thames, and connects the York Road with King's Road, Fulham, was built in <datestruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct>, from the designs of Mr. J. H. Tolme.   It is constructed of iron, and is what is known as a lattice-girder bridge; it is of <num value="5">five</num> spans, borne on massive coupled wrought-iron cylinders. The <num value="3">three</num> central stream spans are each <num value="133">133</num> feet broad. 
   <P>The parish   church, dedicated to All Saints, stands in the High Street, near the bridge over the Wandle; it is a plain, square, brick edifice, dating from near the end of the last century.   The <pb id="P.484" n="484"> greater part of the tower is comparatively ancient, having been built early in the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century; it was, however, re-cased in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, and has been raised, by the addition of a storey, for the reception of a peal of <num value="8">eight</num> bells. The interior of the church contains a few monuments, preserved from the older fabric; among them, <num value="1">one</num> to Alderman Henry Smith, who is represented in gown and ruff, kneeling at a desk, under an entablature supported by Ionic columns.   Alderman Smith was a native of this parish, and came of humble parentage.   He is said to have made a large fortune by business in the City, and having been left a widower, without children, in <datestruct value="1620--"><year reg="1620">1620</year></datestruct>, made over his estates, both real and personal, to trustees for charitable purposes, reserving to himself from them   an annuity of <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>   a year for his maintenance.   His benefactions,<NOTE>Parts of his will were the subject of protracted litigation in <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>-<num value="8">8</num>; but in the end the validity of his bequest was sufficiently established by the Court of Chancery, on appeal.</NOTE> as set forth on his monument, embraced almost every town and village in Surrey, the object being not merely to afford <QUOTE>reliefe</QUOTE> to the needy, but the <QUOTE>setting the poor people a-worke.</QUOTE> Among other bequests, Smith left <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> to purchase lands in order to provide a fund for <QUOTE>redeeming poor prisoners and captives from   the Turkish tyranie;</QUOTE> <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>   to <QUOTE>buy impropriations for godly preachers ;</QUOTE> other moneys to found a fellowship at Cambridge for his own kindred, &amp;c. Alderman Smith died in <datestruct value="1627--"><year reg="1627">1627</year></datestruct>. Near his monument is that of another benefactor-or rather, benefactress--to the parish: it is a mural monument, with small kneeling effigy of Susanna Powell, who died in <datestruct value="1630--"><year reg="1630">1630</year></datestruct>.   She was the <QUOTE>widow of John Powell, servant to Queen Elizabeth, and daughter of Thomas Hayward, yeoman of the guard   to   Henry VIII., Edward VI., and   the Queens Mary and Elizabeth.</QUOTE> Several members of the family of the Brodricks, Viscounts Midleton, are interred here.   Their residence was in the hamlet of Garratt, in this parish. The register records the burial (<datestruct VALUE="1635-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1635">1635</year></datestruct>) of <QUOTE>Sarah, daughter of Praise Barbone,</QUOTE> supposed to be the <QUOTE>Praise God Barebone,</QUOTE> the Puritan leather-seller of Fleet Street, whose name is well known in history in connection with Cromwell's <num value="1">first</num> Parliament. 
   <P>In our account of the Old Kent Road<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="250">250</num>.</NOTE> we have mentioned the fate of Griffith Clerke, Vicar of Wandsworth, his chaplain, and <num value="2">two</num> other persons. They were hanged and quartered at St. Thomas a Waterings on the <datestruct VALUE="1539-07-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1539">1539</year></datestruct>, for denying the royal supremacy. 
   <P>St. Anne's Church, on St. Anne's Hill, was built in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>-<num value="4">4</num>, from the designs of Sir Robert Smirke.   It is a large Grecian temple, with an Ionic portico and pediment at the western end. The body of the church is of brick with stone dressings, the portico and pediment are of stone; from the roof rises a circular tower in <num value="2">two</num> stages, and crowned with a cupola and cross.   The other churches in Wandsworth   are St. Mary's, Summer's Town; Garrett; St. Paul's, on St. John's Hill; and Holy Trinity, near the outskirts of Wimbledon Park. None   of these, however, call for any special mention. 
    <P>Another place of worship here is the Roman  Catholic chapel of St. Thomas of Canterbury, which was opened in <datestruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>There are many places of worship for Dissente; here; in fact, Wandsworth must be a place specially dear to the Nonconformist heart on account of, at all events, <num value="1">one</num> memory.   It is stated by ecclesiastical writers that the <num value="1">first</num> practical movement to secure a Presbyterian organisation in the neighbourhood of the metropolis began with a secret meeting held at Wandsworth.   The Dissenting principles of church government and   rules of worship, as we learn from   Neale's <QUOTE>History of the Puritans,</QUOTE> were set forth in a publication called <QUOTE>The Orders of Wandsworth.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Wandsworth has numbered among its residents a few men of note, of whom we may mention Francis Grose, the antiquary, who lived at Mulberry Cottage, on the Common; and Dr. John Jebb, Bishop of Limerick, who died at West Hill in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>. As already mentioned by us, he is buried at Clapham.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="324">324</num>.</NOTE>   On Voltaire's release from his <num value="2">second</num> imprisonment in the Bastile, he was ordered to leave France, and having come to England, was for some time here as the guest of Sir Everard Fawkener.   His sojourn in England, observes a writer in the <QUOTE>Dictionary of Universal Biography,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>beside that it availed to give him   knowledge and command of the language, filled him   with admiration of that liberty, civil and religious, in which his own country was so deplorably deficient. In England he learnt to admire, and perhaps to understand, Newton, Locke, Shaftesbury, Bolingbroke, Pope, and other noted writers of the same and of the preceding age.   In truth, it was in England that Voltaire found for himself a standing, on the ground of philosophic deism, from which he was not afterwards dislodged by either the reasoning or the ridicule of the atheists of the Encyclopaedia. At no point of his course in after life did the virulence of his hatred of Christianity impel him to <pb id="P.485" n="485"> abandon this position   . ...   During his stay in England--about <num value="3">three</num> years-Voltaire   composed the tragedy of <hi rend=italics>Brutus</hi>, and afterwards, in imitation of the <hi rend=italics>Julius Caesar</hi> of Shakespeare, a tragedy, which he did not venture to bring into public on the theatre.</QUOTE> His tragedy of <hi rend=italics>Zaire,</hi>
which he composed in little more than a fortnight, and which proved <num value="1">one</num> of Voltaire's greatest triumphs, is said to have been written during his stay at Wandsworth. 
    <P>At some little distance on the south side of the  High Street is the hamlet of Garratt, which, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, appears to have consisted of a single house, called <QUOTE>the Garrett,</QUOTE> or, as Lysons says, <QUOTE>the Garvett.</QUOTE> This building was sold towards the end of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century by  William Cecil, afterwards Lord Burghley, to a Mr.  John Smith.   The mansion was afterwards the residence of the Brodricks, Viscounts Midleton, but was pulled down about the middle of the last century, and the grounds which surrounded it were subsequently let to a market-gardener to grow vegetables. 
    <P>When Lysons wrote his <QUOTE>Environs of London,</QUOTE> in the year <datestruct value="1792"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>, this hamlet consisted of about <num value="50">fifty</num> houses by the side of a small common; but the buildings in Garratt Lane--the thoroughfare connecting Wandsworth with Tooting-and its neighbourhood have greatly increased in number within the present century. Various encroachments on the above-mentioned common, about the middle of the last century, led to an association of the neighbours, when, as Sir Richard Phillips tells us, in his <QUOTE>Morning's Walk from   London to Kew,</QUOTE> they chose a president, or <hi rend=italics>mayor</hi>, to protect their rights; and the time of their <num value="1">first</num> election of a mayor being the period of a new Parliament, it was agreed that the <QUOTE>mayor</QUOTE> should be re-chosen after every general election. <QUOTE>Some facetious members of the club,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>gave in a few years local notoriety to this election; and when party spirit ran high in the days of <hi rend=italics>Wilkes and Liberty</hi>, it was easy to create an appetite for a burlesque election among the lower orders of the metropolis.</QUOTE> With a keen eye to their own interests, as well as to that of their village and their country, the publicans at  Wandsworth, Tooting, Battersea, Clapham, and  Vauxhall, <QUOTE>made up a purse,</QUOTE> to give it character.  Foote, Garrick, and Wilkes, it is stated, wrote some of the candidates' addresses, for the purpose of instructing the people in the corruptions which attend elections in the legislature, and of producing those reforms, by means of ridicule and shame, which are vainly expected from the solemn appeals of argument and patriotism. <QUOTE>Not being able to find the members for Garratt in  <Q> Beatson's Political Index,</Q>  or in any of the  <Q>Court Calendars,</Q> </QUOTE> says Sir Richard Phillips, <QUOTE>I am obliged to depend on tradition for information in regard to the early history of this famous borough.   The <num value="1">first</num> mayor of whom I could hear was called Sir John Harper.     He filled   the seat during <num value="2">two</num> Parliaments, and was, it would appear, a man of wit, for on a dead cat being thrown at him   on the hustings, and a by-stander exclaiming that it stunk worse than a fox, Sir John vociferated,  <Q>That's no wonder, for you see it's a <hi rend=italics>poll</hi>-cat!</Q>  This noted   baronet was, in the metropolis, a retailer of brick-dust; and his Garratt honours being supposed to be a means of improving his trade and the condition of his ass, many characters in similar occupations were led to aspire to the same distinctions.</QUOTE> 
    <P>He was succeeded by Sir Jeffrey Dunstan, who was returned for <num value="3">three</num> Parliaments, and was the most popular candidate that ever appeared on the Garratt hustings.   His occupation was that of buying old wigs-once an article of trade like that in old clothes, but become obsolete since the fullbottomed and full-dressed wigs of both sexes went out of fashion. Sir Jeffrey usually carried his wigbag over his shoulder, and, to avoid the charge of vagrancy, vociferated, as he passed   along the streets, <QUOTE>Old Wigs!</QUOTE> but having a person like  AEsop, and a countenance and manner marked by irresistible humour, he never appeared without a train of boys and curious persons, whom   he entertained by his sallies of wit, shrewd sayings, and smart repartees, and from   whom, without begging, he collected sufficient to maintain his dignity of knight and mayor. He was no respecter of persons, and was so severe in his jokes on the corruptions and compromises of power that, under the iron <hi rend=italics>regime</hi> of Pitt and Dundas, this political punch, or street-jester, was prosecuted for using what were then called seditious expressions; and, as a caricature on the times, which ought never to be forgotten, he was, in <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, tried, convicted, and imprisoned! In consequence of this affair, and some charges of dishonesty, he lost his popularity, and at the next general election was ousted by Sir Harry Dimsdale, muffin-seller, a man as much deformed as himself.   Sir Jeffrey could not long survive his fall; but in death, as in life, he proved a satire on the vices of the proud: for in <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct> he died-like Alexander the Great and many other heroes renowned in the historic pageof suffocation from excessive drinking! Sir Harry  Dimsdale dying also before the next general election, and no candidate starting of sufficient originality <pb id="P.486" n="486"> of character, and, what was still more fatal, the victuallers having failed to raise a <QUOTE>public purse</QUOTE> --which was as stimulating a bait to the <hi rend=italics>independent</hi>
candidates for Garratt as it is to the <hi rend=italics>independent</hi>
candidates for a certain assembly--the borough of Garratt has since remained vacant, and the populace have been without a <QUOTE><hi rend=italics>professional</hi> political buffoon.</QUOTE> 
   <P> <QUOTE>None but those who have seen a London mob on any great holiday,</QUOTE> adds Sir Richard Phillips, <QUOTE>can form a just idea of these elections. On several occasions a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> persons, half of them in carts, in hackney-coaches, and on horse and ass-back, covered the various roads from London, and choked up all the approaches to the place of election. At the <num value="2">two</num> last elections I was told that the road within a mile of Wandsworth was so blocked up by vehicles that none could move backward or forward during many hours, and that the candidates, dressed like chimney-sweepers on a May-day, or in the mock fashion of the period, were brought to the hustings in the carriages of peers, drawn by <num value="6">six</num> horses, the owners themselves condescending to become the drivers!</QUOTE>

   <P>Robert Chambers, in his <QUOTE>Book of Days,</QUOTE> gives a full and detailed account of the scenes enacted here at the mock elections for the <QUOTE>borough of  Garratt,</QUOTE> which, as we have stated above, always accompanied a general election, as the shadow attends on a substance.   He tells us that the local publicans found it to be their interest to encourage the managers of the fun to constitute themselves a committee <hi rend=italics>en permanence</hi>.   On these occasions local wits drew up and printed election addresses, squibs, and counter-squibs, &amp;c., and the successful candidates were <QUOTE>chaired</QUOTE> round the town like veritable <QUOTE>knights of the shire.</QUOTE> The <num value="2">two</num> last and the most celebrated members for Garratt were those eccentric characters, <QUOTE>Sir</QUOTE> Jeffrey Dunstan and <QUOTE>Sir</QUOTE> Harry Dimsdale, who flourished at   Wandsworth whilst Lord North and Pitt ruled in Downing Street.   Of these individuals Mr.   Chambers writes:-- <QUOTE>In <datestruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct> the death of  <Q>Sir</Q>    John Harper left  <Q> Sir</Q>  Jeffrey Dunstan without a rival; but in the election of <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct> he was ousted by a new   candidate,  <Q>Sir</Q>  Harry Dimsdale, a muffin-seller and dealer in tin-ware, almost as deformed as himself, but by no means so great a humourist.

He enjoyed his honour, however, only a short time, dying before the next general election. He was the last of the grotesque mayors, for no candidates started after his death; the publicans did not, as before, subscribe towards the expenses of the day, and so the great saturnalia died a natural death.</QUOTE> Of <QUOTE>Sir</QUOTE> Jeffrey Dunstan we have already given some particulars in our account of St. Giles's-in-the-Fields,<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="20">20</num>.</NOTE> which was generally the scene of his daily avocations. 
   <P>The Garratt election has gained more than its fair share of notoriety from the fact that Samuel Foote--who was present here in <datestruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>, and paid <num value="9">nine</num> guineas for a window to view the proceedings-made it the subject of a farce, entitled <hi rend=italics>The Mayor of Garratt</hi>, which was put on the stage at the Haymarket. The character of <QUOTE>Snuffle</QUOTE> in this play was derived from John Gardiner, a local cobbler and grave-digger, who was <num value="1">one</num> of the candidates, under the title of <QUOTE>Lord Twankum;</QUOTE> that of <QUOTE>Crispin Heeltap</QUOTE> was copied from another candidate, also a shoemaker, who came forward as <QUOTE>Lord Lapstone.</QUOTE> The other characters also are identified by Mr. Chambers; <QUOTE>Beau Silvester</QUOTE> being the prototype   of <QUOTE>Matthew   Mug,</QUOTE> the principal candidate in Foote's drama, who says, in his address to the worthy electors, <QUOTE>Should I succeed, you, gentlemen, may depend on my using my utmost endeavours to promote the good of the borough, to which purpose the encouragement of your trade and manufactures will principally tend. Garratt, it must be owned, is an inland town, and has not, like Wandsworth, and Fulham, and Putney, the glorious advantages of a port; but what nature has denied, industry can supply. Cabbages, carrots, and cauliflowers may be deemed at present your staple commodities; but why should not your commerce be extended?   Were I, gentlemen, worthy to advise, I should recommend the opening of a new branch of tradesparrowgrass, gentlemen, the manufacturing of sparrowgrass!   Battersea, I own, gentlemen, at present bears the bell; but where lies the fault? In ourselves, gentlemen. Let us but exert our natural strength, and I will take upon me to say that a <num value="100">hundred</num> of grass for the corporation of Garratt will in a short time, at the London markets, be held as at least an equivalent to a Battersea bundle.</QUOTE> We have already spoken of asparagus as <num value="1">one</num> of the chief products of Battersea.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="479">479</num>.</NOTE>
 
    <P>There   are in   existence   <num value="3">three</num> very curious etchings, by Valentine Green, representing the Garratt elections, the scenes in the streets, ana the chairing of a successful candidate. All these will be found given in Chambers' <QUOTE>Book of Days,</QUOTE> and <num value="1">one</num> of these we reproduce on page <num value="487">487</num>.   It must be owned that the licence assumed during these seasons of misrule was somewhat iescennine in its character, and that mirth occasionally degenerated into vulgar buffoonery; but, after all, the scene was little more boisterous than that which was witnessed in our fathers' clays at many a county and borough election, where popular feeling ran high-especially those at Brentford; and doubtless, the mock elections of Garratt had their redeeming qualities in the safety-valve which they afforded to discontented spirits. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct> an attempt was made, though without success, to revive the whimsical farce. A placard was prepared and issued to forward the interests of a certain <QUOTE>Sir John Paul Pry,</QUOTE> who was to come forward, along with <QUOTE>Sir Hugh Allsides</QUOTE> (<num value="1">one</num> Cullendar, the beadle of All Saints' Church) and <QUOTE>Sir Robert Needale</QUOTE> (Robert Young, a surveyor of roads), described as <QUOTE>a friend to the ladies who attend Wandsworth Fair.</QUOTE> This placard, which may be read in Hone's <QUOTE>Every-day Book,</QUOTE> displays a, <QUOTE>plentiful lack of wit</QUOTE> compared with those of the last century. The project, therefore, failed, and Garratt, in consequence, has had no representative since the worthy muffin-seller mentioned above. 
   <P>Like Blackheath, Peckham, Camberwell, and other suburban spots round London which we have visited in the course of our perambulations, Wandsworth once had its annual fair, which was abolished only within the memory of living persons. From <QUOTE>Merrie England in the Olden Time</QUOTE> we learn that at the end of the last century spectators were invited to see exhibited here <QUOTE>Mount Vesuvius, or the burning mountain by moonlight; rope and hornpipe-dancing; a forest, with the humours of lion-catching; tumbling by the young Polander, from Sadler's Wells; several diverting comic songs; a humorous dialogue between Mr. Swatchall and his wife; sparring-matches; the <hi rend=italics>Siege of Belgrade,</hi>
&amp;c.-and all for threepence</QUOTE> In the year <datestruct value="1840"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct> the fair was attended by the theatrical caravan of Messrs. Nelson and Lee, and by other lesser attractions. 
   <P>Between   Wandsworth   Common   and   Garratt Lane formerly stood Burntwood Grange, the seat of H. Grisewood, Esq.   It was noted for its magnificent gardens and conservatory, which are described   in   Bohn's <QUOTE>Pictorial Hand-book   of London</QUOTE> where views are given of the exterior <pb id="P.489" n="489"> and interior of the conservatory and of the dairy adjoining.   The gardens of S. Rucker, Esq., on West Hill, are, or were till recently, remarkable for the great variety of flowering trees and shrubs; indeed, horticulture and floriculture seem to have been extensively practised in this locality for many years, for, like Battersea in former times, Wandsworth is mentioned by Lysons, in <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct> as abounding in market-gardens. It may be added that this place a century ago had about it all the adjuncts of a country life, for a picture painted in <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct> shows the reapers in the corn-fields here, and a windmill in full operation at the foot of the slope of the hill which it covers.

<p><NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.489.1">Entrance to Putney</LEMMA></NOTE> 
<P>In this chapter we have, fortunately, to guide us the experience of a local antiquary, Miss Guthrie, whose work on the <QUOTE>Old   Houses of Putney</QUOTE> deserves some formal recognition from the Society of Antiquaries, as an attempt to rescue from oblivion a variety of mansions which are of historic and national interest. It is almost needless to say that we have here drawn largely on her work for trustworthy information.   Putney, which lies between Wandsworth and Barnes, and forms part of the manor of Wimbledon, was at a very remote period a place of some little importance, in consequence of the <QUOTE>fishery</QUOTE> which existed here. The <num value="1">first</num> mention of the name--which occurs in the <QUOTE>Domesday Book,</QUOTE> where it is styled <QUOTE>Putenhie</QUOTE> --is in connection with the fishery and ferry. According to an ancient custom of the Manor of Wimbledon, <QUOTE>out of every fishing-room belonging to Mortlake and Putney, several salmons were due to be delivered there for the licence or liberty of fishing and hauling and pitching their nets on the soil and shore of the lord of the manor.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct> the fishery was held for the <num value="3">three</num> best salmon caught in March, April, and May; but this rent was afterwards converted into a money payment. At the sale of Sir Theodore Jansen's estates, on account of his complicity in the <QUOTE>South Sea Bubble,</QUOTE> it was let for <measure value="6l." type=currency><num value="6">six</num> pounds</measure>, but was afterwards raised to <measure value="8l." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num> pounds</measure>. It brought the latter sum till <datestruct value="1786"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct>, since which period the <QUOTE>fishery,</QUOTE> as such, has been abandoned, although, as we learn from   Lysons' <QUOTE>Environs</QUOTE> and Faulkner's <QUOTE>History of Fulham,</QUOTE> fishing continued to be carried on here till the early part of the present century. The salmon caught here are described as being very few in number, but of remarkably fine quality; whilst smelt were in great abundance in the months of March and April, and were highly esteemed. <num value="1">One</num> or <num value="2">two</num> sturgeons were generally taken in the course of a year, and occasionally a porpoise, which, together with the sturgeons, were claimed by the Lord   Mayor.   The fishermen were bound to deliver them as soon as caught to the water-bailiff. <QUOTE>For a porpoise they received a reward of <measure value="15s." type=currency><num value="15">fifteen</num> shillings</measure>, and a guinea for a sturgeon.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The ferry here, at the time of the Conquest, yielded a toll of <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure> to the lord of the manor. In ancient times, it appears, it was customary for people travelling from London in this direction to proceed as far as Putney by water. During the reign of Elizabeth it was decreed that if any waterman neglected to pay to the owner of this ferry the sum   of <num value="1">one</num> halfpenny for every stranger, and a farthing for each inhabitant of Putney, he should pay a fine of <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence to the lord of the manor. The ferry continued to be of importance till early in the reign of George II., when it was superseded by a wooden bridge across the Thames from Putney to Fulham, of which we shall speak more fully presently. 
   <P>As a town or village Putney now possesses little to recommend it, except its ancient houses, which are still very numerous. The High Street extends from the river-side up to the Heath: it is a broad thoroughfare, and contains an average supply of shops and places of business. There are those still <pb id="P.490" n="490"> living who remember this street when it had <num value="1">one</num> very broad pavement shaded by stately trees, and a kennel on either side, by means of which the roadway was watered in summer. 
   <P>Fairfax House, in the High Street, the finest of all the above-mentioned manors of Putney, is believed to have been built by a gentleman of that name in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It is even said that her Majesty dined here upon <num value="1">one</num> occasion. At the back of the house is a spacious lawn, the trees in which are said to have been planted by Bishop Juxon. 
   <P>Chatfield House, also in the High Street, is rendered interesting from the circumstance that Leigh Hunt died there while on a visit to its occupant. 
   <P>On a portion of the ground now occupied by River Street and River Terrace, stood in former times a building which in its latter days became known as <QUOTE>the Palace,</QUOTE> from the fact of its having been frequently honoured   by the presence of royalty.   Miss Guthrie tells us that it is described as having been a spacious red-brick mansion of the Elizabethan style of architecture, forming <num value="3">three</num> sides of a square, with plate-glass windows overlooking the river, and that it possessed extensive gardens and pleasure-grounds. It was built within a court-yard, and approached through iron gates. 
   <P>This house covered the site of the ancient mansion of the Welbecks, whose monument, dated <datestruct value="1477--"><year reg="1477">1477</year></datestruct>, is in the parish church close by.   The building was erected at the end of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century by John Lacy, <QUOTE>a citizen and clothworker of London ;</QUOTE> and the ceilings of <num value="1">one</num> of the rooms, it is stated, comprised the arms of the Clothworkers' Company among its ornamentation. Mr. Nichols, in his <QUOTE>Progresses of Queen Elizabeth,</QUOTE> says that she <QUOTE>honoured Lacy with her company more frequently than any of her subjects.</QUOTE> Indeed, from   the churchwardens' accounts at Fulham, it seems that her Majesty visited Mr. Lacy at least a dozen times between the years <datestruct value="1579--"><year reg=1579>1579</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1603--"><year reg=1603>1603</year></datestruct>; that she frequently dined with this highly-favoured host, and sometimes sojourned for <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> days under his hospitable roof; and that the last occasion of her visit there was only about <num value="3">three</num> months before her death. 
    <P>A survey of Wimbledon Manor, written in <datestruct value="1617--"><year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct>, mentions the circumstance of James I. having been in this house.   His Majesty was himself a member of the Clothworkers' Company.   King  James and his queen, we are told, <QUOTE>went from  Putney to Whitehall previously to their coronation.</QUOTE> A few years later the house in which the <QUOTE>maiden queen</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>gentle Jamie</QUOTE> had spent so many pleasant hours was occupied by General Fairfax. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct>, Cromwell, equally jealous of the Parliament and the king, who was then at Hampton Court, fixed the head-quarters of his army at Putney in order to watch their respective movements. The houses of the principal inhabitants were occupied by the general officers, who, during their residence here, held their councils in the parish church, and sat with their hats on round the communion-table, relieving the monotony of their deliberations by psalm-singing or a sermon from   some popular preacher.   In Whitelocke's <QUOTE>Memorials,</QUOTE> under date <datestruct VALUE="1647-09-18"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=18>18</day>, <year reg=1647>1647</year></datestruct>, we read :-- <QUOTE>After a sermon in Putney Church, the general, many great officers, field officers, inferior officers, and agitators, met in the church, debated the proposals of the army, and altered some few things in them, and were full of the sermon, which was preached by Mr. Peters.</QUOTE> Old   deceased historians and local authorities, we may here state, differ widely in their accounts of the manner in which Cromwell passed his time while domiciled at Putney. Thus, while the former represent him as being entirely engrossed with State affairsholding   conferences, and   issuing   mandates all tending to the future overthrow of royalty; the latter, on the other hand, would lead us to believe that his <hi rend=italics><num value="1">one</num></hi> thought was the beautifying of the place, and that his chief occupation was the planting of mulberry-trees all over Putney. 
   <P>On the escape of the king from Hampton, on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, the army quitted Putney, after a residence of <num value="3">three</num> months. 
   <P>After the battle of Brentford, the Earl of Essex determined to follow the king into Surrey, and a bridge of boats was constructed for that purpose between Fulham and Putney.   The structure is thus referred to in a newspaper paragraph of the period:-- <QUOTE>The Lord General hath caused a bridge to be built upon barges and lighters over the Thames between Fulham   and Putney, to convey his army and artillery over into Surrey, to follow the king's forces; and he hath ordered that forts shall be erected at each end thereof to guard it; but for the present the seamen, with long boats and shallops full of ordnance and musketeers, lie there upon the river to secure it.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The <QUOTE>Palace,</QUOTE> at the time when it was occupied by General Fairfax, is described in a newspaper of the period, printed by the authority of Parliament, as belonging to Mr. Wymondsold, <QUOTE>the high sheriff.</QUOTE> It was afterwards held by Sir Theodore  Jansen, from whose trustees it was purchased by  Paul d&lsquo;Aranda, whose daughter, generally styled  Madame d&lsquo;Aranda, was its owner at the commencement of the present century, when Lysons <pb id="P.491" n="491"> wrote his <QUOTE>Environs.</QUOTE> On the death of this lady the house was thrown into Chancery, and after the lapse of the usual term of years, none out of the many heirs who presented   themselves having made good their claim to the property, it was disposed of by a clergyman, who speedily levelled with the ground all that remained of the interesting old mansion. A portion of River Street, Gay Street, &amp;c., are erected on what was once the gardens and pleasure-grounds.   The stately iron gates, which in their time had opened wide to admit the <QUOTE>fantastic Elizabeth,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>ungainly James,</QUOTE> and, when royalty for the time was nodding to its fall, the martial form of General Fairfax, were degraded into an entrance to a brush manufactory; whilst on a part of the once beautifully laid-out garden was erected <QUOTE>a shed or booth, where on Sunday afternoons active maidens disposed of fruit, lemonade, &amp;c., to carefully-got-up young gentlemen, who came hither in crowds to breathe a purer air than that afforded them in the mighty city-Putney being at the time of which we speak a favourite resort with the citizens.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In close proximity to <QUOTE>the Palace</QUOTE> was formerly another ancient building, the residence of the  Hochepieds and Larpents; and on the site now occupied by <num value="2">two</num> large ranges of buildings known as <QUOTE>The Cedar Houses,</QUOTE> stood at <num value="1">one</num> time Putney  House, and also another mansion called <QUOTE>The  Cedars.</QUOTE> Putney House, in the early part of the last century, was the residence of Mr. Gerard van  Neck, who lived here in a style of great splendour, and, it is said, was frequently visited by George II., who stayed here as his guest during his hunting expeditions in the neighbourhood of Putney. For several years Putney House and   The Cedars were in the occupation of the Hon. Leicester and the   IHon. Lincoln   Stanhope, brothers of the <num value="4">fourth</num> Earl of Harrington.   Mr. Heneage Legge, the latest occupant of Putney House, was well known for his benevolence.   He seems to have been, too, a true son of the Church, and showed his appreciation of his pastor in a manner which, to him, must have been   peculiarly agreeable. <QUOTE>Daily a knife and fork were laid on his table for the special use of the Rev. Henry St. Andrew St.  John, should he choose to avail himself of the good old squire's free-hearted hospitality, while a saddlehorse was kept in readiness for him whenever he felt inclined for equestrian exercise.</QUOTE> 
    <P>About the year <datestruct value="1839"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct> Putney House was converted into a College for Civil Engineers, which was founded by subscriptions among the nobility and others, for the purpose of conferring a superior education on the sons of respectable persons in the engineering, mathematical, and mechanical sciences. The college was broken up in <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>, and the fine old mansion pulled down. 
   <P>At the foot of Starling Lane stood the residence of Sir Abraham Dawes, the founder of the almshouses which bear his name in Wandsworth Lane. Sir Abraham was <num value="1">one</num> of the farmers of the Customs, an eminent loyalist of the reign of Charles II., and <num value="1">one</num> of the richest commoners of his time. The almshouses were <QUOTE>for <num value="12">twelve</num> poor almsmen and almswomen, being single persons and inhabitants of Putney.</QUOTE> For some time, however, only women have been admitted. 
    <P>The Watermen's School, in Wandsworth Lane, was founded in <datestruct value="1684--"><year reg="1684">1684</year></datestruct> by Thomas Martyn, a merchant of London, as a token of gratitude for having been saved from   drowning by a Putney waterman.   The school is a spacious red-brick building, and in it is afforded maintenance and education for <num value="20">twenty</num> boys, the sons of watermen. 
    <P>Cromwell Place now occupies the ancient site of  Mr. Campion's house, where General Ireton lodged in the year <datestruct value="1646"><year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct>. In Lysons' time this house was a school, in the occupation of the Rev. Mr. Adams.  According to a date in <num value="1">one</num> of the rooms, it was built in <datestruct value="1533--"><year reg="1533">1533</year></datestruct>. Some years ago this interesting old house was taken down, and its materials employed in the construction of the cottage, known as Cromwell Place. The names of Gromwell House and  Cromwell Place naturally lead <num value="1">one</num> to suppose that  Cromwell himself was quartered somewhere in this neighbourhood.   It has been stated that the house he occupied stood at the corner of the High Street and Wandsworth Lane; but the absence of any record of the fact renders it impossible to fix upon this, or any other locality, with any degree of certainty.   Grove House, which stood between the High Street and D&lsquo;Israeli Road, but has been removed to make room for a new thoroughfare, was a fine old mansion, also associated by tradition with the name of Oliver Cromwell. But we cannot guarantee this tradition, for it has been observed- <QUOTE>There is scarce a village near London in which there is not <num value="1">one</num> house appropriated to Cromwell, though there is no person to whom they might be appropriated with less probability.   During the whole of the Civil Wars Cromwell was with the army; when he was Protector, he divided his time between Whitehall and Hampton Court.</QUOTE> 
    <P>D&lsquo;Israeli Road is, of course, of recent formation, composed of middle-class houses. The naming of the thoroughfare seems to have given rise to some little difficulty, and became the subject of proceedings in the police-court; for <num value="1">one</num> enthusiastic resident, taking objection to the name, obliterated <pb id="P.492" n="492"> it from the house whereon it was affixed, and for so doing was summoned by the Board of Works to answer for his conduct, and had to pay a fine. 
   <P>Putney is memorable as the birthplace of at least <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> eminent characters. Nicholas West, Bishop of Ely, the reputed son of a baker, was born here; as also was Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, whose father was a blacksmith in the village. The site of Cromwell's birthplace is still pointed out by tradition, and is in some measure confirmed by the survey of Wimbledon Manor, quoted above, for it describes on that spot <QUOTE>an ancient cottage called the smith's shop, lying west of the highway from Richmond to Wandsworth, being the sign of the Anchor.</QUOTE> The plot of ground here referred to is now covered by the <QUOTE>Green Man</QUOTE> public-house. Cromwell, as every reader of English history knows, was for some time in the service of Cardinal Wolsey, in the character of steward or agent. He became a member of Parliament, and when his unfortunate master was lying under the charge of high treason, distinguished himself by a bold and able defence of the cardinal. The king, we are told, conceived a very high opinion of his abilities, and <QUOTE>heaped on him numerous employments.</QUOTE> On the abolition 
<FIGURE id="Fig.492" n="2000.14.0182"><HEAD>Putney House, <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 of the papal supremacy he was made Vicar-General of the Spiritualities, in virtue of which office he presided at the synod held in <datestruct value="1537--"><year reg="1537">1537</year></datestruct>. In the same year he was created Baron Okeham, of Okeham, in Rutlandshire, and <num value="3">three</num> years later was elevated to the earldom of Essex. To support these dignities he had made to him large grants of land, chiefly in Essex; but he likewise had conferred on him a grant of the manor of Wimbledon. His sudden fall is well known, and may therefore be here summed up in a few words. Essex had been instrumental in bringing about the union of Henry VIII. and Anne of Cleves; and the immediate cause of his downfall is said to have been the king's disgust for the royal lady. He was arrested for treason in <datestruct VALUE="1540-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct>, and in the following month he perished by the hands of the executioner. 
   <P>Putney is, singularly enough, connected with the following incident in   the life of Wolsey:--On ceasing to be the holder of the Great Seal of England, and obeying the royal mandate, Wolsey quitted the sumptuous palace of Whitehall, which Henry had marked for his own, and removed to his palace at Esher. For this purpose he embarked on board his barge at Whitehall Stairs. The news <pb id="P.493" n="493"> of his <QUOTE>disgrace</QUOTE> had spread abroad, and the Thames soon became crowded with boats filled with men and women, hooting and insulting him, and shouting aloud their delight to see him sent to the Tower; but the indignant prelate threw a defiant glance on his exulting enemies, and instead of <hi rend=italics>descending</hi> the river to the Tower, as they had been led to imagine he would, he <hi rend=italics>ascended</hi> it towards Putney. Here he took the road westward to Esher. As he was riding up Putney Hill he was overtaken by <num value="1">one</num> of the royal chamberlains, Sir John Norris, who there presented him with a ring as a token of the continuance of his majesty's favour. Stow declares that <QUOTE>when the Cardinal had heard Master Norris report these good and comfortable words of the king, he quickly lighted from his mule all alone, as though he had been the youngest of his men, and incontinently kneeled down in the dirt upon both knees, holding up his hands for joy of the king's most comfortable message. Master Norris lighted also, espying him so soon upon his knees, and kneeled by him, and took him up in his arms, and asked him   how he did, calling upon him to credit his message.  <Q> Master Norris,</Q>  quoth the Cardinal,  <Q>when I consider the joyful 
<FIGURE id="Fig.493" n="2000.14.0183"><HEAD>Lime Grove, Putney, In <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 news that you have brought to me, I could do no less than greatly rejoice. Every word pierces so my heart, that the sudden joy surmounted my memory, having no regard or respect to the place; but I thought it my duty, that in the same place where I received this comfort, to laud and praise God upon my knees, and most humbly to render unto my sovereign lord my most hearty thanks for the same.</Q> </QUOTE> Wolsey told the chamberlain that his tidings were worth half a kingdom, but as he had nothing left but the clothes on his back, he could make him no suitable reward. He, however, gave Sir John a small gold chain and crucifix. <QUOTE>As for my Sovereign,</QUOTE> he added, <QUOTE>sorry am I that I have no worthy token to send him; but, stay, here is my fool, that rides beside me; I beseech thee take him to court, and give him to his Majesty. I assure you, for any nobleman's pleasure he is worth a <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds</measure>.</QUOTE> 
<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.493.1">Bishop Bonner's Palace</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>Bishop Bonner is said to have had a residence here, the site of which is now covered by some houses belonging to Mr. Avis. Bonner's house is reported to have contained some good old oak panelling, a portion of which is still in existence; it is described as being of the old napkin pattern, <pb id="P.494" n="494"> with this peculiarity, that in every panel there was inserted a small cross. 
   <P>Where the Lower Terrace now stands was at <num value="1">one</num> time a fine old family mansion. Its entrance-hall and public apartments were of stately dimensions, while the kitchen, it is said, afforded unmistakable evidence of having been a private chapel. 
   <P>Essex House is generally believed to have been built and occupied by Queen Elizabeth's ill-starred favourite, Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, about the end of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century. The royal arms, with the initials E. R., appear in the ornamentation of the drawing-room, and also in <num value="1">one</num> of the bedrooms. The wainscoting of the various rooms is stated to be of wood which formed a portion of <num value="1">one</num> of the ships of the Spanish Armada. Some weight is given to the tradition that Lord Essex lived in this house by the fact that his Countess was the daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham, who passed the latter years of his eventful life in the quiet seclusion of Barn Elms, which adjoins Putney on the west, and where he was frequently visited by his son-in-law. 
   <P>At the base of Putney Hill, where the stately trees of former times have given place to modern villas, stood Lime Grove, the seat of Lady St. Aubyn.   The mansion derived its name from a grove of limes which formed an avenue to the house.   The structure was <num value="1">one</num> of those thoroughly English mansions, erected for convenience and comfort rather than for display. The apartments were spacious and lofty, and contained a rich store of pictures and articles of <hi rend=italics>vertu</hi>; among the former were several by Opie, of whom Sir John St. Aubyn was an early patron.   This house was for some time the residence of the family of Edward Gibbon, who tells us, in his Autobiography, that his grandfather acquired,   here <QUOTE>a spacious house   with gardens and lands,</QUOTE> and resided here <QUOTE>in decent hospitality.</QUOTE> His father, who inherited the property, had the nonjuror, William Law, as his tutor; but, in Gibbon's words, <QUOTE>the mind of saint is above or below the present world; and so, while the pupil proceeded abroad on his travels, the tutor remained at Putney, the much honoured friend and spiritual director of the whole family.</QUOTE> Here the historian was born, on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct> (old style) in <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>; and his baptism, and that of his <num value="5">five</num> younger brothers and a sister, may be seen recorded in the parish register.   He received his early education partly at home, and partly at a day-school in the village, till old enough to be sent to a boarding-school. A great part of his time was spent with his aunt, at the house of his maternal grandfather.   This house, he tells us, was near Putney Bridge and churchyard.   It was subsequently tenanted by Sir John Shelley, the Duke of Norfolk, and other members of the upper classes.   Here Gibbon spent his holidays whilst at school, until the house was broken up on his mother's death, when he was in his <num value="12">twelfth</num> year. 
    <P>An amusing story is told of Gibbon in the last volume of Moore's <QUOTE>Memoirs :</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>The <hi rend=italics>dramatis personae</hi> were Lady Elizabeth Foster, Gibbon, the historian, and an eminent French physician-the historian and doctor being rivals in courting the lady's favour. Impatient at Gibbon occupying so much of her attention by his conversation, the doctor said crossly to   him,  <Q>When   my Lady Elizabeth Foster is made ill by your twaddle, I will cure her.</Q>  On which Gibbon, drawing himself up grandly, and looking disdainfully at the physician, replied,     <Q>When   my   Lady Elizabeth Foster is dead from   your recipes, I will immortalise her.</Q> </QUOTE> 
    <P>Another resident of Putney was David Mallet, the Scotch poet, to whom   Sarah, Duchess of  Marlborough, left <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> for writing the life of the great duke, her lord. His character, as we know from Johnson's Life of him, was immoral; but, at all events, it seems to have been in keeping with such principles as he had; for Gibbon, in his <QUOTE>Memoirs,</QUOTE> speaks of having   been   taken to  Putney <QUOTE>to the house of Mr. Mallet, by whose philosophy,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>I was rather scandalised than reclaimed.</QUOTE> 
    <P>John Tolland, the deistical writer, spent the latter years of his life in Putney, living in obscure lodgings at a carpenter's, where he died in <datestruct value="1722--"><year reg="1722">1722</year></datestruct>. Here, too, at the house of the Countess of Guildford, on Putney Hill, died Henry Fuseli, the artist, in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>Theodore Hook, in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, took a cottage at Putney, of which neighbourhood he had always been fond; while at Putney he re-wrote-or composed from   rough illiterate materials--the very entertaining <QUOTE>Reminiscences</QUOTE> of his old theatrical and musical friend, Michael Kelly. 
   <P>At Layton House was living, in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>, Mary Wollstonecraft, the widow   of the poet Shelley. Whilst resident here, or at the White House, near the river-side, she wrote her husband's <QUOTE>Memoirs.</QUOTE> She was the daughter of William Godwin, the author of <QUOTE>Caleb Williams,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>St. Leon,</QUOTE> and other works, by marriage with Mary Wollstonecraft, who was also eminent as a writer.   Mrs. Shelley was the author of <QUOTE>Frankenstein,</QUOTE> and other novels; she died in <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>The spacious old mansion in the Richmond  Road, long known by the name of Putney School, <pb id="P.495" n="495"> owing to its having been for generations used as a school, was originally a country residence of the Duke of Hamilton.   Here also General Fairfax resided for the space of <num value="9">nine</num> months, during which period he was frequently visited by Cromwell. It is also said that the house was at <num value="1">one</num> time the residence of the notorious Duchess of Portsmouth. This building, which is now called Putney House, was for a short time the Hospital for Incurables, previous to its transfer to Putney Heath.   On the removal of the hospital, the old mansion was purchased by Colonel Chambers, well known as <QUOTE>Garibaldi's Englishman.</QUOTE> 
   <P>West Lodge, on Putney Common, was for some years the home of Douglas Jerrold, who here entertained many of the men who in a few years were destined to become the leaders of literary thought. Whilst resident at Putney he founded the Whittington Club, and wrote his celebrated <QUOTE>Caudle Lectures.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Putney, <num value="2">two</num> centuries ago, was a place to which the Londoners repaired to play at bowls; such, at least, is the assertion of John Locke, who writes, in <datestruct value="1679--"><year reg="1679">1679</year></datestruct>: <QUOTE>The sports of England for a curious stranger to see are horse-racing, hawking, hunting,

Horace Walpole, in a letter to Sir Horace Mann, dated <datestruct VALUE="1750-08-2"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=2>2</day>, <year reg=1750>1750</year></datestruct>, giving an account of the apprehension of James McLean, the <QUOTE>fashionable highwayman,</QUOTE> writes :-- <QUOTE>McLean had a quarrel at Putney Bowling-green <num value="2">two</num> months ago with an officer whom he challenged for disputing his rank; but the captain declined till McLean should produce a certificate of his nobility, which he had just received.</QUOTE> McLean was executed at Tyburn, as we have stated in a previous part of this work.<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="195">195</num>.</NOTE>

   <P>The house at Putney Heath occupied by the <QUOTE>heaven-born minister,</QUOTE> William Pitt, and in which he died, was called at that time <QUOTE>Bowling-Green House;</QUOTE> it derived its name from   the fashionable place of entertainment mentioned above, and which existed on its site nearly a <num value="100">hundred</num> years before. In the early days of George III. it was <pb id="P.496" n="496"> celebrated for its public breakfasts and evening assemblies during the summer season.   It was occupied for. some time by Archbishop Cornwallis previous to Pitt taking up his residence there. 
    <P>For the following account of Mr. Pitt's death we are indebted to Lord Brougham's biography of the Marquis Wellesley:-- <QUOTE>Lord Wellesley,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE>returned home from his glorious administration at a very critical period in our parliamentary history. Mr. Pitt was stricken with the malady which proved fatal--a typhus fever, caught from some accidental infection when his system   was reduced by the stomach complaint under which he had long laboured. This their last interview was in Pitt's villa on Putney Heath, where he died within a few days.   Lord Wellesley called upon me there many years after; the house was then occupied by my brother-in-law, Mr. Eden, whom I was visiting. His lordship showed me the place where these illustrious friends sat when they met for the last time. Mr. Pitt, he said, was much emaciated and enfeebled, but retained his gaiety and his constitutionally sanguine disposition, and even expressed his confident hopes of recovery. In the adjoining room he lay a corpse within the ensuing week; and it is a singular and melancholy circumstance, resembling the stories told of William the  Conqueror's deserted state at his decease, that some <num value="1">one</num> in the neighbourhood having sent a message to inquire after Mr. Pitt's state, he found the wicket, and then the door of the house, both open, and, as nobody answered the bell, he walked through the rooms until he reached the bed on which the minister's body lay lifeless, the sole tenant of the mansion, the doors of which but a few hours before were darkened by crowds of suitors alike obsequious and importunate--the vultures whose instinct haunts the carcases only of living ministers.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Lord Brougham shows us, in his <QUOTE>Autobiography,</QUOTE> what a gentle, good-natured, and entertaining host Pitt could be, in spite of his apparent coldness and hauteur, by telling the story of his friend William Napier, who went to Putney Heath on a visit to Pitt, fully resolved to obtrude his strong Whiggism on his Tory host. <QUOTE>Primed with fierce recollections and patriotic resolves, he endeavoured to keep up, and not to conceal, a bitter hatred of the minister; but in vain. All hostile feelings gave way to that of unbounded surprise.</QUOTE> Brougham adds the following interesting sketch of the famous Lady Hester Stanhope, the niece of the <QUOTE>heavenborn minister :</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>Lady Hester was there. He found her very attractive; and so rapid and decided was her conversation, so full of humour and keen observation, and withal so friendly and instructive, that it was quite impossible not to succumb to her, and to become her slave, whether laughing or serious. She was certainly not beautiful; but her tall, commanding figure, her large dark eyes and varying expression, changing as rapidly as her conversation, and equally vehement, kept him, as he expressed it, in a state of continual admiration. She had little respect for the political coadjutors of Mr. Pitt, and delighted to laugh at them. Lord Castlereagh she always called  <Q>his monstrous lordship;</Q>  but Lord Liverpool she invariably treated as a constant theme for ridicule and contempt.</QUOTE> 
     <P>Pitt, who was only in his <num value="47">forty-seventh</num> year at the time of his death, had been <num value="19">nineteen</num> years   <num value="1">First</num> Lord of the Treasury, and died   on the anniversary of the day on which, <num value="5">five</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num> years before, he had <num value="1">first</num> entered Parliament. <QUOTE>In his neighbourhood,</QUOTE> writes Mr. John Timbs in his <QUOTE>Autobiography,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>he was much respected, and was a kind master to   his domestics.   A person who, a little before the great statesman's death, was in the room, stated that it was then heated to a very high and oppressive temperature; and the deep voice of the dying minister, as he asked his valet a question, startled a visitor who had been unused to it. There was long a doubt as to the last words of Mr. Pitt. Earl   Stanhope, in his  <Q> Life</Q>  of the great minister, gave them   from   a manuscript left by his lordship's uncle, the Hon. James H. Stanhope, as,  <Q>Oh, my country! how I love my country!</Q>  But upon reexamination of the manuscript, a somewhat obscure <num value="1">one</num>, no doubt was left in Lord Stanhope's mind that the word  <Q>love</Q>  was a mistake for  <Q>leave.</Q>    The expression, as in this manner finally authenticated, is in perfect and most sad conformity with the disastrous state of the Continental war produced by the battle of Austerlitz, when Mr. Pitt was approaching his end.    <Q>We may roll up that map now,</Q>  he said, pointing to a map of Europe on the wall of the Foreign Office, when the news came of Bonaparte's great victory.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Adjoining Bowling-green   House   is the villa which for the space of <num value="2">two</num> years was the residence of Mrs. Siddons and her husband. Bristol House, which is close by, owes its name to the Bristol family, in whose possession and occupation it was from the commencement of this century till some few years ago.   It may be added that James  Macpherson, the translator and reputed author of  Ossian's Poems, had a villa on Putney Heath. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct> steps were taken here to commemorate the Great Fire of London, although Putney had no close connection with the City. A   certain Mr. ., <pb id="P.497" n="497"> David Hartley, the descendant of a namesake who more than <num value="50">fifty</num> years previously had obtained a patent for the construction of fire-proof buildings, attempted to revive public interest in the invention by a series of experiments, to which he invited the presence of royalty.   A pillar was erected, mainly at his instance, on the Common, which bears the following inscription :-- <QUOTE>The Right Hon. John Sawbridge, Esq., Lord Mayor of London, laid the foundation-stone of this pillar   <num value="110">110</num> years after the Fire of London, on the anniversary of that dreadful event, and in memory of an invention for securing buildings against fire.</QUOTE> 
    <P>With reference to the above-mentioned experiments, Sir Richard Phillips, in his <QUOTE>Walk from London to Kew</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>), writes :-- <QUOTE>The house, still standing at the distance of a <num value="100">hundred</num> yards from the obelisk, serves as a monument of the inventor's plans; but, like everything besides, it recently excited the avarice of speculation, and when I saw it was filled with workmen, who were converting it into a tasteful mansion, adding wings to it, throwing out verandas, and destroying every vestige of its original purpose.   <num value="1">One</num> of the workmen showed me the chamber in which, in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, the king and queen took their breakfast, while in the room beneath fires were lighted on the floor, and various inflammable materials were ignited, to prove that the rooms above were fire-proof. Marks of these experiments were still visible on the charred boards.   In like manner there still remained charred surfaces on the landings of the staircase, whereon fires had   been   ineffectually lighted for the purpose of consuming them, though the stairs and all the floorings were of ordinary deal! The fires in the rooms had been so strong that parts of the joists in the floor above were charred, though the boards which lay upon them were in   no   degree   affected.   The   alterations making at the moment enabled me to comprehend the whole of Mr. Hartley's system. Parts of the floors having been taken up, it appeared that they were double, and that his contrivance consisted in interposing between the <num value="2">two</num> boards sheets of laminated iron or copper.   This metallic lining served to render the floor air-tight, and thereby to intercept the ascent of the heated air; so that, although the inferior boards were actually charred, the less inflammable material of metal prevented the process of combustion from taking place in the superior boards.   These sheets of iron or copper, for I found both metals in different places, were not thicker than tinfoil or stout paper, yet, when interposed between the double set of boards, and deprived of air, they effectually stopped the progress of the fire.</QUOTE> The invention, however, seems to have sunk entirely into obscurity, and few records now exist of it except the pompous obelisk and the remains of the original Fire-proof House, which are still embodied in the present building. 
    <P>Owing to its healthy and open situation, Putney is a favourite spot for charitable institutions, aa it was for <num value="2">two</num> centuries for ladies' schools. <num value="1">One</num> of the most important is the Royal Hospital for  Incurables, which is situated on the summit of  West Hill, near to the Fire-proof House.   This institution was founded in <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct> by the efforts of the late Dr. Andrew   Reed.   It was established to cherish and to relieve, during the remainder of life, persons, above the pauper class, suffering from incurable maladies, and thereby disqualified from   the duties of life.   To persons having a home, but without the means of support, a pension of <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> a year is given.   The <num value="1">first</num> home of the charity was at the village of Carshalton. At the end of <num value="3">three</num> years it became necessary to secure larger premises, and Putney House was engaged.  The accommodation thus secured sufficed till the year <datestruct value="1861"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>, when a <num value="2">second</num> house in the immediate neighbourhood was added as a branch establishment.   <num value="2">Two</num> years later the building now occupied as the hospital was purchased, together with the freehold of <num value="24">twenty-four</num> acres of land surrounding it. The edifice, called Melrose Hall, had been a distinguished family residence; it was well built, and contained a large number of rooms suitable to the purposes of the institution. The building has since been extended by the addition of <num value="2">two</num> wings, and now affords accommodation for <num value="200">200</num> inmates.   It contains on an average about <num value="150">150</num> patients, whilst upwards of <num value="300">300</num> are in receipt of pensions from the charity at their own homes. This institution, we may add, is unendowed, and is therefore entirely dependent for its support on the voluntary subscriptions of the public. 
    <P>Putney Heath, some <num value="400">400</num> acres in extent, bears a faint resemblance to that of Hampstead in its slightly broken surface of sand, turf, and heather. From   the higher portion some good views of the river and the metropolis are obtained. Like Wimbledon Common, Hounslow Heath, and other open spots round London, this heath in bygone times was a noted rendezvous for highwaymen; and towards the close of the last century it was the scene of so ghastly a spectacle, that few cared to traverse- it after nightfall, for here was set up the gibbet on which the body of the notorious Jerry Avershaw was left to dangle in the wind, after having expiated his numerous crimes on <pb id="P.498" n="498"> Kennington Common, which was at that time the place of execution for the county of Surrey.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="334">334</num>.</NOTE>

   <P>The heath has also been from time to time the scene of many bloodless, and also of some bloody, private, and also political, duels. Here, in <datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>, an encounter took place between George, <num value="3">third</num> Lord Chandos, and Colonel Henry Compton, which resulted in the latter being killed. Here, too, Mr. William Pitt, when Prime Minister, exchanged shots, on a Sunday in <datestruct VALUE="1798-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, with Mr. George Tierney, M.P.; but, fortunately, the affair ended without bloodshed. In <datestruct VALUE="1809-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, was fought the memorable duel-happily, not a fatal <num value="1">one</num>-between George Canning and his colleague, Lord Castlereagh. This <QUOTE>affair of honour</QUOTE> took place near the obelisk, and close by a semaphore telegraph which was erected by the Admiralty in <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>Although not actually on Putney Heath, the record of another <QUOTE>affair of honour</QUOTE> which took place not far off, at Barn Elms, may not be out of place here. This affair took place in <datestruct VALUE="1667-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>-<num value="8">8</num>. The parties engaged were George Villiers, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.498" n="2000.14.0185"><HEAD>Bowling-Green House.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 Duke of Buckingham, attended by Sir Robert Holmes and Captain William Jenkins; and Francis Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, attended by Sir John Talbot and the Hon. Bernard Howard, a younger son of the Earl of Arundel. Pepys, in recording this duel in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> says it was <QUOTE>all about my Lady Shrewsbury, at that time, and for a great while before, a mistress to the Duke of Buckingham; and so her husband challenged him, and they met; and my Lord Shrewsbury was run through the body, from the right breast through the shoulder; and Sir John Talbot all along up <num value="1">one</num> of his armes; and Jenkins killed upon the place; and all the rest in a little measure wounded.</QUOTE> A pardon under the Great Seal, dated the <datestruct VALUE="-02-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct> following, was granted to all the persons concerned in this tragical affair. Lord Shrewsbury died in consequence of his wound in the course of the same year. During the fight the Countess of Shrewsbury is reported to have held the duke's horse, in the dress of a page. This lady was Anna Maria Brudenell, daughter of the Earl of Cardigan. After the death of her husband she was married, secondly, to a son of Sir Thomas Brydges, of  Keynsham, Somerset. <pb id="P.499" n="499">

 <pb id="P.500" n="500"> 
    <P>The heath, however, has witnessed other meetings besides those assembled for the purpose of bloodshed, for here, in <datestruct VALUE="1648-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct>, the good people of  Surrey met to petition the House of Commons in favour of the re-establishment of episcopacy.  Charles II. is said to have reviewed his forces on  Putney Heath; and in <datestruct VALUE="1767-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>, George III. reviewed the Guards at the same place. On this occasion upwards of <measure value="63l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="63">63</num></measure> was taken at the bridge, being the largest amount ever known in <num value="1">one</num> day. 
    <P>According to Pepys, Charles II. and his brother, the Duke of York, used to run horses here. We find in the <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date of <datestruct VALUE="1667-05-7"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=7>7</day>, <year reg=1667>1667</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>To St. James's; but there find Sir W.

    <P>At the east corner of the heath is Grantham  House, the residence of Lady Grantham. On the west side the heath is bounded by Putney Park and Roehampton.   The former, styled Mortlake  Park in old memorials, was reserved to the Crown by Henry VIII.   Charles I. granted the park to  Richard, Earl of Pembroke, who here erected a splendid mansion, which, soon after his decease, was sold, together with the park, to Sir Thomas  Dawes, by whom   it was again disposed of to  Christina, Countess of Devonshire.   Waller and the other poets of the period sang her praises; and Charles II. visited her at this place with the queen-mother and the royal family. The mansion was at last pulled down by Lord Huntingfield.  Roehampton has been   an aristocratic part of  Putney for more than <num value="2">two</num> centuries. 
    <P>Southward, Putney Heath merges itself into the more extensive area of Wimbledon Common; but our limited space will not allow of our saying more of this interesting locality than that every July it is the scene of the annual meeting of the National Rifle Association. The old windmill, formerly a picturesque object on the breezy common, has been converted into the head-quarters of the Rifle Association. These annual gatherings are attended by the <hi rend=italics>elite</hi> of fashion, and always include a large number of ladies, who generally evince the greatest interest in the target practice of the various competitors, whether it be for the honour of carrying off the Elcho Shield, the Queen's or the Prince of Wales's Prize, or the shield shot for by our great Public Schools, or the Annual Rifle Match between the Houses of Lords and Commons. 
   <P>We must now retrace our steps down Putney Hill, and through the village to the river-side. Here we meet with a few old-fashioned brick dwelling-houses, together with sheds for boat-building, boat-clubs, and boating-houses; for Putney has long been the head-quarters for aquatic matches on the Thames. The day of the annual boat-race between the rival crews of the Oxford and Cambridge Universities, which takes place generally in March or April, has been for many years-indeed, almost without intermission since <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>-a red-letter day in the annals of Putney.   For many days prior to the race <num value="1">one</num> or other of the rival crews, while undergoing their preparatory trials and <QUOTE>coaching,</QUOTE> take up their abode at the <QUOTE>Star and Garter,</QUOTE> a comfortable hostelry overlooking the Thames, or in the private houses in the neighbourhood. And the day of the race itself is looked forward to, not only by the inhabitants of the village, but by the public at large, with almost as much interest as is felt concerning the fate of the <QUOTE>blue ribbon of the turf</QUOTE> when the <QUOTE>Derby</QUOTE> is run for on Epsom Downs.   In <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, the <num value="1">first</num> year of the race, the contest took place at Henley, when Oxford was proclaimed the winner. In <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>, <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>, <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, and <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, the course was from Westminster to Putney, Cambridge on each occasion proving the victors.   In the following year the Oxford crew came in <num value="1">first</num>, the race being rowed over the same course.   From   <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></datestruct> the river between Putney and Mortlake was the scene of the race, Cambridge on each occasion carrying off the honours.   In <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>, <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, and <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct> the Oxford crew were the winners; but in <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct> the Cantabs once more were hailed as the victors.

The tables were turned, however, in the following year, when Cambridge won the race, and this they succeeded in doing on every subsequent occasion down to <datestruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>.   In <datestruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct> and<datestruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct> the race was won alternately by Oxford and Cambridge; but in <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct> the judges decided that the race was a <QUOTE>dead heat.</QUOTE> Putney is the starting-point of the race, and Mortlake its goal, and the course is about <num value="4">four</num> miles and a half. The time occupied in the race has varied from about <num value="21">twenty-one</num> to twentyfive minutes.   Formerly the race was sometimes rowed from Putney to Mortlake, and at others the reverse way; but of late years the starting-point has always been near the ugly iron aqueduct of the Chelsea Water-works Company, just above Putney Bridge. On the day of the race the usually quiet village of Putney puts on a festive appearance, the place is gay with banners, &amp;c., and many of the inhabitants, no doubt, reap a rich harvest for the time being.   All along the banks of the river, up to the winning-post by the <QUOTE>Ship</QUOTE> at Mortlake, the pathways and buildings commanding a view of <pb id="P.501" n="501"> the race are crowded with excited spectators, who watch with eager interest the animated scene which presents itself. 
    <P>Putney was at <num value="1">one</num> time the starting-place for the Thames Regatta; but other races besides the great University contest still take place here very frequently during the summer months.   Before quitting the river-side we may mention that in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date of <datestruct VALUE="1649-04-16"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=16>16th</day>, <year reg=1649>1649</year></datestruct>, John Evelyn tells us he <QUOTE>went to Putney by water in barge, with divers ladies, to see the Schooles or Colledges of the Young Gentlewomen.</QUOTE> These schools were probably those known to have been kept by a Mrs. B. Makins, who was <num value="1">one</num> of the most clever and learned women of her time, and had been tutor to the Princess Elizabeth, daughter of Charles I. 
    <P>The river-side of Putney at this time was probably full of picturesque <QUOTE>bits</QUOTE> of rural scenery; for a few weeks afterwards we find Evelyn again making a voyage thither, no doubt by barge, <QUOTE>to take prospects in crayon to carry with me into France.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Putney Church, of which we must now speak, is dedicated to St. Mary, and stands at the bottom of the High Street, near the bridge.   It was originally built as a chapel of ease to Wimbledon; the precise date of its erection, however, is unknown.   That it dated from, at all events, the beginning of the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century is certain, as it is on record that Archbishop Winchelsea held a public ordination here in <datestruct value="1302--"><year reg="1302">1302</year></datestruct>. The ancient structure exhibited the architecture of different periods far apart. The arches and columns which separated the nave from   the aisles belonged to Henry VI.'s time, while the north and south walls were said to be coeval with the original building. On the south side of the old church was a small chapel, built early in the reign of Henry VIII. by Bishop West, whom   we have mentioned above. In <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct> the church, with the exception of the tower, was rebuilt, from   the designs of Mr. E. Lapidge, and in the Perpendicular style of architecture.   <LEMMA id="lemma.501.1">The edifice is large</LEMMA> and lofty; some of the windows are enriched with stained glass. The tower, which is of <num value="4">four</num> stages and surmounted by battlements, is supposed to have been built not later than the middle of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century, <QUOTE>from the fact of a coat of arms above the belfry door being appropriated solely to the family of Chamberlyn, a name not found amongst the inhabitants of Putney since that period.</QUOTE> On the rebuilding of the church, Bishop West's chapel was removed to the north side of the chancel, where it was rebuilt stone by stone; it is small, and in the fan tracery of the vaulted roof appear the bishop's arms and initials. Its eastern window of stained glass was presented, in <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>, by Dr. Longley, Archbishop of Canterbury, as a memorial of his mother, who was long a resident in the parish of Putney. There are several monuments and tablets, mostly from the old church, but none of any particular interest. In <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct> the flooring of the chancel was re-laid with encaustic tiles, and the body of the fabric re-seated with open benches in place of the old-fashioned pews. 
   <P>Pepys, in his amusing <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> thus makes mention of visits he paid to Putney Church:-- <QUOTE>---<num value="28">28th</num>, <num value="166">166</num>-   (Lord's Day). After dinner, by water--the day being mightily pleasant, and the tide serving finely, reading in Boyle's  <Q>Book of Colours </Q> --as high as Barne Elms, and then took <num value="1">one</num> turn alone, and then back to Putney Church, where I saw the girls of the school, few of which pretty; and then I came into a pew, and met with little James Pierce, which I was much pleased at, the little rogue being very glad to see me; his master reader to the church. There was a good sermon and much company.   But I sleepy, and a little out of order at my hat falling down through a hole beneath the pulpit, which, however, after the sermon, I got up by the help of the clerk and my stick.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Again, on the <num value="25">25th</num>--, we find this entry:-- <QUOTE>(Lord's Day.) I up to Putney, and stepped into church to look upon the fine people there, whereof there is great store, and <hi rend=italics>the-young ladies</hi>!</QUOTE> A later entry runs thus :-- <QUOTE><num value="2">2nd</num>--  (Lord's Day). After dinner I and Tom, my boy, up to Putney by water, and there heard a sermon, and many fine people in the church.</QUOTE> 
   <P>On the site of a house now standing between the churchyard and the bridge, there formerly stood an old red-brick house, surrounded by trees, which at the beginning of the last century was tenanted by Mr. James Porten, a merchant of London, whose youngest daughter, Judith, was the mother of Edward Gibbon, of whom we have spoken above. 
   <P>At the commencement of this chapter we have spoken of the ferry which in former times was the only means of transit between Putney and Fulham. Down to the commencement of the last century the want of a bridge here was greatly felt; for at that time there was none between those of London and Kingston. When Laud was Bishop of London, he narrowly escaped drowning in crossing from Putney to his palace, <num value="1">one</num> dark night, by the capsizing of the ferry-barge with his horses and suite. In <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct> , a Bill for the building of a bridge at this point of the Thames was brought into Parliament, <pb id="P.502" n="502"> but rejected, several of the members who spoke against it basing their arguments on the assumption that the City of London would be irretrievably ruined if such a project were carried out. An Act of Parliament, however, was ultimately passed, mainly through the instrumentality of Sir Robert Walpole, and the bridge was completed in <datestruct value="1729--"><year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct>. Faulkner, in his <QUOTE>History of Fulham,</QUOTE> says: <QUOTE>The plan of the bridge was drawn by Mr. Cheselden, the surgeon of Chelsea Hospital, who,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>in his profession acquired the greatest reputation, and by the skill displayed in this useful piece of architecture   has shown   the   affinity that exists among   the sciences.</QUOTE> This, however, as Mr. Chasemore points out, in his <QUOTE>History of the Old Bridge,</QUOTE> was a mistake; <QUOTE>the records clearly proving that the bridge was built after a design by Sir Jacob Ackworth, who was also the designer of old  <Q>Kingston, Chertsey, Steans (Staines), Datchet, and Windsor Bridges.</Q> </QUOTE> This was not the <num value="1">first</num> bridge that has spanned the Thames between Putney and Fulham, for, as we have stated above, a bridge of boats was constructed to enable Lord Essex to cross over with his army after the <QUOTE>battle of Brentford.</QUOTE> Forts were erected at either end to guard 
<FIGURE id="Fig.502" n="2000.14.0187"><HEAD>Essex House, Putney.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 it. When Faulkner wrote his <QUOTE><num value="5">5</num> History of Fulham,</QUOTE> in <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, the <hi rend=italics>tete du pont</hi> on the Putney side of the river was <QUOTE>still plainly discernible.</QUOTE> The position of this bridge of boats was about <num value="500">500</num> yards below where <LEMMA id="lemma.502.1">Putney Bridge</LEMMA> now stands; and the fort on this side of the river is said to have remained intact until about the year <datestruct value="1845"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>, when it was removed; it stood on the site of a market-ground below the <QUOTE>Cedars.</QUOTE> 
   <P>By the Act authorising the construction of the bridge, the sum of <measure value="62l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="62">62</num></measure> was directed to be divided annually between the widows and children of the poor watermen of Fulham and Putney, as a recompense to their fraternity, who, upon the building of the bridge, were constrained from plying upon Sundays. The proprietors purchased the ferrywhich, on an average, produced the owners <measure value="400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400">400</num></measure> per annum--for the sum of <measure value="8000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="8000">8,000</num></measure>. Lysons tells us that on the abolition of the ferry, the Bishop of London reserved to himself and his household the right of passing the bridge toll-free. This privilege stills holds good. Formerly the king paid <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> per annum for the passage of himself and his household over the bridge. 
   <P>The <LEMMA id="lemma.503.1">present bridge</LEMMA> is constructed of timber, and <pb id="P.503" n="503"> is almost as ungainly in appearance as that of Battersea, which we have described in a previous chapter;<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="473">473</num>.</NOTE>   it is an ugly black structure of timber, with no redeeming feature to recommend it in point of taste. The length of the bridge, according to Sir Jacob Ackworth's design, was to be <num value="786">786</num> feet, and the width <num value="24">twenty-four</num> feet, with a clear water-way of <num value="700">700</num> feet, with <num value="26">twenty-six</num> openings or locks; and there were also to be <QUOTE>on the sides of the way over the bridge angular recesses for the safeguard and convenience of foot-passengers going over the same.</QUOTE> The bridge was lighted by oil-lamps, which were removed in <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>, and gas substituted.   With this exception, the old bridge remained much in its original condition down till <datestruct value="1870"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>, when <num value="2">two</num> of the locks or openings were thrown into <num value="1">one</num>. Since then <num value="3">three</num> locks have been converted into <num value="1">one</num>; so that there are now but <num value="23">twenty-three</num> openings, instead of <num value="26">twenty-six</num>, as originally. 
   <P>The approach to the bridge from   the High Street, Putney, is built on arches, which are thus referred to by Faulkner:-- <QUOTE>On Putney side there is a stone terrace, <num value="16">sixteen</num> feet wide, enclosed from the water by a wall, being the road from the bridge; and to prevent the earth from bulging out, there are arches turned horizontally in the bed of the road, a contrivance well adapted for this purpose, though never used before, by which means this wall has never bent or started, though the tide rises <num value="12">twelve</num> feet against it, and it: can be taken down at any time without the least inconvenience to the road.</QUOTE> At the Putney end of the bridge there is a quaint little toll-house, of red brick; at the Fulham entrance to the bridge there is a double toll-house, very quaint and foreign in its appearance, the rool of which spans the roadway. 
    <P> <QUOTE>Passing down the river,</QUOTE> says Ireland, in his <QUOTE>Picturesque Views of the River Thames,</QUOTE> pub lished as far back as <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>the decayed and apparently dangerous state of Putney Bridge cannol fail to <hi rend=italics>disgust</hi> the observer. This disgraceful ap pendage to the river was erected in the year <datestruct value="1729"><year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct> when the pontage or toll was settled on the sub scribers by Act of Parliament; and, as I am informed, was within <num value="12">twelve</num> months after so greatly advantageous to them   as to repay all their disbursements.   At the extremities of this <hi rend=italics>tottering</hi>
bridge stand the rival churches of Putney and Fulham, which are said to have been built by <num value="2">two</num> sisters.</QUOTE> 
   <P><num value="2">Two</num> toll-collectors were stationed at each end of the bridge. They were furnished <QUOTE>with hats, and gowns of good substantial cloth of a deep blue colour, lined with blue shalloon, and carried staves with brass or copper heads.</QUOTE> These, it appears, were quite as much for use as for show, for the people did not at <num value="1">first</num> at all relish the idea of having to pay toll for crossing a bridge. <QUOTE>They did not pay when they went over London Bridge; why should they pay at Putney?</QUOTE> The consequence of this was that several very serious affrays took place on the bridge between the collectors and the passengers during the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="10">ten</num> years of its existence. But the stalwart collectors stood their ground, until the popular discontent had abated, and the tolls were thenceforward   paid without complaint. 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct> bells were ordered to be hung <QUOTE>on the tops of the toll-houses, to give notice of any disorder that might happen, so that the collectors might go to the assistance of each other as there might be occasion.</QUOTE> The <num value="2">two</num> bells, which are still there, are, we are told, occasionally used for this purpose, and are rung nightly, when the day tollman goes off and the night tollman goes on duty.  The date upon the bells shows that they were cast in <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>.   Doubtless these bells did good service a century or so ago, when Putney Heath and the surrounding neighbourhood was infested with highwaymen and footpads. 
    <P>What little of the <QUOTE>picturesque</QUOTE> there might have been in the quaint old bridge in former times, when taken as an accessory in a view of either  Putney or Fulham   as seen from the Thames, is now wholly lost by the <LEMMA id="lemma.503.2">aqueduct of the Chelsea  Waterworks Company</LEMMA>, which spans the stream on massive cylindrical supports a few yards above it. 
     <P>Bidding adieu to Surrey, and crossing the bridge, we now make our way once more into Middlesex, in order to complete our western circuit of suburban London. <pb id="P.504" n="504">

<p><NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.504.1">The Fulham Shore</LEMMA></NOTE>
<p><NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.504.2">Fulham and Putney</LEMMA></NOTE> 
<P>The parish of Fulham, upon which we now enter, lies in Middlesex, about <num value="4">four</num> miles south-west from Hyde Park Corner, and covers a large extent of ground, the greater part of which, down to comparatively recent times, was laid out as marketgardens; and the parish still contributes largely to the daily supply of Covent Garden. Originally, Fulham was much larger than now, for it included Hammersmith within its limits; and even at the present time it has an area of nearly <num value="4000">4,000</num> acres. Antiquaries have differed as to the origin of the name of Fulham; but the usual, and perhaps most probable, derivation is from the Saxon <QUOTE>Fullenhame,</QUOTE> which means the resort or habitation of birds. It was so called, it is supposed, from the abundance of water-fowl found here, and it would be difficult to imagine a place more fitted for the resort of such birds than Fulham must have been before the river was embanked, when the land for some distance from the stream was a mere swamp, and, in many places, under water at every high tide. The place, we are also told, <QUOTE>abounded <pb id="P.505" n="505"> in trees, which gave them shelter.</QUOTE> Camden, in his <QUOTE>Britannia,</QUOTE> derives the name from the Saxon word <QUOTE>Fullenham,</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>Foulenham,</QUOTE> <hi rend=italics>volucrum domus</hi>, <QUOTE>the habitation of birds, or place of fowls.</QUOTE> Norden agrees with this etymology, and adds, <QUOTE>It may also be taken for <hi rend=italics>volucrum amnis</hi>, or the river of fowl; for  <Q>ham</Q>  also, in many places, signifies 
<hi rend=italics>amnis</hi>, a river.</QUOTE> In Sommer's and Lye's Saxon Dictionaries it is called <hi rend=italics>Fullanham</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>Foulham,</hi>
 <QUOTE>supposed from the dirtiness of the place.</QUOTE> 
   <P>It is Pennant's opinion that as far back as the days of the Romans <QUOTE>all the land round Westminster was a flat fen, which continued to beyond Fulham.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The parish of Fulham is, or was, separated on the east from Chelsea by a rivulet, which rises in Wormholt Scrubs, and falls into the Thames opposite to Battersea; on the west it is bounded by Chiswick and Acton; on the north by Hammersmith and Kensington; and its southern boundary is the river Thames. Notwithstanding its distance from London, Fulham   is now joined on to the <QUOTE>great city</QUOTE> by lines of houses which extend along the high road on either side. Near the entrance to the village, by the Fulham   Road, there are 
<FIGURE id="Fig.505" n="2000.14.0189"><HEAD>Fulham Church, In <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 several antiquated-looking family mansions, standing in their own grounds, and almost shut in from observation by stately elms and cedars. The High Street, which branches off at right angles towards the bridge, has the dull, sleepy aspect of a quiet country town: many of the quaint old red-brick houses, with high-tiled roofs, carry the mind of the observer back to times long gone by. As viewed from the Thames, the scene is far different: here we have, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, prim villas embosomed in trees, with lawns and gardens sloping down to the water; and on the other the old parish church, backed by the trees surrounding the palace of the Bishop of London. 
   <P>Close by, to the left, on entering Fulham from the bridge, on the spot now occupied by the abutment of the aqueduct, formerly stood Egmont Villa, some time the residence of Theodore Hook, of whom we have already had occasion to speak in our accounts of Berners Street and Sydenham.<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="464">464</num>; and <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="306">306</num>.</NOTE>
It was about the year <datestruct value="1831"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct> that Hook, who had been for years the lion of West-end parties, and the wit of all London circles, took up his abode <pb id="P.506" n="506"> here; having got rid of his house in Cleveland Row, he became the tenant of a modest cottage close to the bridge, with a small garden sloping towards the river.   Here he spent the last <num value="10">ten</num> years of his life, entertaining politicians, statesmen, men of letters, and even royal dukes, and, in fact, most of those who had idolised him as the accomplished editor of <hi rend=italics>John Bull</hi> in its early and palmy days. 
    <P>As a wit and humourist, and as a diner, Theodore  Hook enjoyed a high reputation in his day; but his jokes, on some occasions, took that practical turn which became reprehensible. He had, besides, a happy knack of dining, uninvited, at the houses of strangers.   In this he was successful, no less by his unblushing impudence than by his really remarkable powers as an <hi rend=italics>improvisatore</hi>. The following story of his ability in this way has been often told, but will bear repeating :-- <QUOTE>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion he and his friend Mathews,<NOTE>Another version of the anecdote makes Hook's companion to have been Terry.</NOTE> the actor, found their way into the mansion of a gentleman who was entertaining a select company, and having spent a pleasant evening, to the great confusion and wonderment of the host, to whom Hook and his friend were perfect strangers, but very agreeable companions, the intruders were about to depart, when the gentleman of the house begged to be favoured with their names.   Whereupon Hook seated himself at the pianoforte and explained himself in the following extemporaneous verse:-- 
        <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=couplet><L>I am very much pleased with your fare;              Your cellar's as prime as your cook;           My friend here is Mathews, the player,              And I'm Mr. Theodore Hook!</QUOTE></QUOTE>
 
   <P>Passing <num value="1">one</num> day in a gig with a friend by the villa of a retired London watchmaker at Fulham, Hook pulled up, and remarked that <QUOTE>they might do worse than dine in such a comfortable little box!</QUOTE> He accordingly alighted, rang the bell, and on being introduced to the gentleman, coolly told him that, as his name was so celebrated, he could not help calling to make his acquaintance! Hook and his friend were invited to stay to dinner, and after spending a jovial afternoon, they set out for home; but on their way thither the gig, owing to their unsteady driving, was nearly smashed to pieces by the refractory horse. 
   <P>Barham, in his <QUOTE>Life and Remains,</QUOTE> tells us that a friend once said to Hook, while looking at Putney Bridge from the garden of his villa, that he had been informed that it was a very good investment, and asked him if it really answered. <QUOTE>I don't know,</QUOTE> replied Theodore; <QUOTE>but you have only to cross it, and you are sure to be told (<hi rend=italics>tolled</hi>).</QUOTE> 
    <P>It is on record that when Sir Robert Peel's <num value="1">first</num> administration was formed in the year <datestruct value="1834"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, the  Lord Chamberlain sent immediately for Hook, and offered to him the Inspectorship of Plays, then held by George Colman the younger, in case the ailing veteran could be prevailed upon to resign. The office was perhaps the only <num value="1">one</num> which he might have received, without exposing his patrons to disagreeable comment; but their kindness was fruitless.   George Colman being an old friend,  Hook felt some delicacy in communicating the suggestion to him, and the government was again changed before the negotiation could be cormpleted.   Almost immediately afterwards Colman died, and Charles Kemble was appointed in his room; and he again had resigned in favour of his accomplished son before Lord Melbourne's ministry was finally displaced. Their fate was announced on the <datestruct VALUE="1841-08-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, but ere then Theodore  Hook's hopes and fears were at an end.   His death is thus mentioned by Mr. Raikes in his <QUOTE>Diary:</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>Sunday, <num value="29">29th</num> <hi rend=italics>August</hi>.-The English papers mention the death of Theodore Hook, which has been accelerated by his love for <hi rend=italics>brandyand-water</hi>.   He was a very good-natured, clever man, and a popular novel-writer of the day.

   <P><LEMMA id="lemma.506.1">The parish church, dedicated to All Saints</LEMMA>, stands near the river-side, at the end of Church Lane, and the west side of the churchyard abuts upon the moat which bounds the east side of the palace grounds. It is an ancient stone building, consisting of nave, aisles, and chancel, with a tower at the western end. The edifice is built of stone, but, with the exception of the tower, to a great extent covered with plaster.

It has been well described as <QUOTE>little else than a collection of high pews and deep galleries contained within <num value="4">four</num> walls, pierced at intervals with holes for the admission of light; in fact, <num value="1">one</num> of the worst specimens of those suburban churches which have of late years so rapidly and happily disappeared before the growing taste for a purer and more devotional style of church architecture.   The only portion of it which has any architectural pretension is the east end of the north aisle, which was built in <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The large east window, of <num value="5">five</num> lights, is filled with stained glass, and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> others have also coloured glass in them, in the shape of armorial bearings; but most of the windows are modern, with semi-circular heads, and without tracery.  The tower of the church, however, is a feature of which Fulham is deservedly proud.   It consists of <num value="5">five</num> stages, and, like its twin-sister at Putney, is surmounted by battlements, with a turret rising well above them.   The date of its erection is uncertain, but it was probably in the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century.   It has, however, been   restored, and some alterations have been made in its details; the large west window, with flowing tracery, is modern. This tower is remarkable as containing <num value="1">one</num> of the finest and softest-toned peals of <num value="10">ten</num> bells in England; they were cast, or re-cast, by  Ruddle, in the middle of the last century.

    <P>The monuments both within and without the church are numerous and interesting, notably <num value="1">one</num> to John Viscount Mordaunt, the father of the great Lord Peterborough.   Lord Mordaunt, who died in <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, was Constable of Windsor Castle, and his statue here--the work of Francis Bird, who carved the Conversion of St. Paul on the west pediment of St. Paul's Cathedral-represents him in Roman costume, holding a baton in his right hand.   Within the communion rails is the effigy of Lady Leigh, who is represented as seated under an arch supported by Corinthian columns; she is holding an infant in her arms, and has another child beside her, habited in the dress of the times. The monument is dated <datestruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></datestruct>. Bishops  Gibson and Porteus are also commemorated by monuments in the church. Several of the Bishops of London lie buried in the churchyard, not in the church itself. The example was set by Dr.  Compton, who used to say, <QUOTE>The church for the living, and the churchyard for the dead.</QUOTE> These graves are marked by altar-tombs, for the most part with no other ornamentation than the arms of the diocese of London.      Bishop Blomfield, who died in <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>, lies in the new burial-ground, opposite the vicarage.   There is a tablet to his memory near the western entrance of the church; it is a plain brass plate, enclosed within a frame of  Gothic design.   In the churchyard there are other monuments to men of note in our military, naval, and civil annals. In this churchyard, in <datestruct VALUE="1841-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>,  <year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, Theodore Hook was buried <QUOTE>in the presence of a very few mourners, none of them known to rank or fame, including none of those who had profited as politicians by his zeal and ability, or had courted him in their lofty circles for his wit and fascination.</QUOTE> His executors found that he had died deeply in debt.   His books and other effects produced <measure value="2500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2500">2,500</num></measure>, which sum was, of course, surrendered to the Crown as the privileged creditor.  There was some hope that the Lords of the  Treasury might grant a gift of this, or some part of it, to his <num value="5">five</num> children, who were left wholly unprovided for; but this hope was not realised.  A   subscription was raised, and   the   King   of  Hanover sent   <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>; but few of his old Tory friends aided the widow and orphans with their purse. Such is gratitude! 
   <P>Among the ornaments of this church is a very handsome service of communion plate.   In the report of the commissioners to King Edward VI., in <datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>, it is stated that they found in Fulham Church <QUOTE><num value="2">two</num> challiss <hi rend=italics>(sic</hi>) of sylver, with pattents, <pb id="P.508" n="508"> parsell gylte, and a lyttell pyxe of sylver parsell gylte.</QUOTE> These still exist, and to them have since been added <num value="2">two</num> very handsome silver flagons.

<NOTE resp=bolles><LEMMA id="lemma.508.1">Bishop's Farm</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>Faulkner, in his account of Fulham, mentions <num value="2">two</num> fine yew-trees as growing on each side of the principal entrance of the churchyard, and another, very much decayed, on the north side, probably coeval with the church itself. 
   <P>On the north side of the churchyard are Sir William Powell's Almshouses, founded and endowed in <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>, for <num value="12">twelve</num> poor widows. They were rebuilt in <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, and again in <datestruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct>. The almshouses are built of light brick   and   stone, of Gothic design, and somewhat profusely ornamented with architectural details. 
   <P>From   the western end of the churchyard a raised pathway, called Bishop's Walk, leads to the entrance of Fulham Palace.   The pathway extends for about a quarter of a mile along the river-side, and has on the right the moat and grounds of the palace, and on the left the raised bank of the Thames. 
   <P>The Manor House of Fulham-or, as it is now called, <LEMMA id="lemma.508.2">Fulham <QUOTE>Palace</QUOTE> </LEMMA>-has been the summer residence of the Bishops of London for more than <num value="8">eight</num> centuries.   The present structure is a large but dull and uninteresting brick building, with no pretension to architectural effect.   The house and grounds, comprising some <num value="37">thirty-seven</num> acres, are surrounded by a moat, over which are <num value="2">two</num> bridges, <num value="1">one</num> of which, a draw-bridge, separates the gardens from the churchyard. The principal entrance, which is situated on the west side, is approached from the Fulham Road under a fine avenue of limes and through an arched gateway. The building consists of <num value="2">two</num> courts or quadrangles; the oldest part dates from the time of Henry VII., when it was built by Bishop Fitzjames, whose arms, impaling those of the see of London, appear on the wall and over the gateway.   <LEMMA id="lemma.508.3">The hall</LEMMA>, the principal apartment in the great quadrangle, is immediately opposite the entrance.   As an inscription over the chimney-piece   states, it was erected, as well as the adjoining courtyard, by Fitzjames, on the site of a former palace, which was as old as the Conquest.   It was completed by Bishop Fletcher, father of the dramatist, in <datestruct value="1595--"><year reg="1595">1595</year></datestruct>; used as a hall by Bishop Bonner and Bishop Ridley during the struggles of the Reformation, and retained its original proportions till it was altered in the reign of George II., by Bishop Sherlock, whose arms, carved in wood, appear over the fire-place.   Bishop Howley, in the reign of George IV., changed it into a private unconsecrated chapel; but it was restored to its original purposes as a hall in the year <datestruct value="1868"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>, on the erection by Bishop Tait-now Archbishop of Canterbury--of a new   chapel of more suitable dimensions. The hall is a good-sized room, and contains in the windows the arms of the Bishops of London; it is wainscoted all round, and has a carved screen at <num value="1">one</num> end. Upon the walls hang portraits of Henry VII., George II., Queen Anne, Queen Mary II., William III., Henry VIII., James II., Charles I., and Cromwell, besides <num value="2">two</num> full-length pictures--<num value="1">one</num> representing Margaret of Anjou, and the other Thomas a Becket. 
   <P><LEMMA id="lemma.508.4">The new chapel</LEMMA>, which is on the south-west side of the older portion of the palace, is a small brickbuilt edifice, erected at the cost of Bishop Tait, from   the designs of Mr. Butterfield, and consecrated in <datestruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct>.   Externally the building has little or no architectural pretensions; but the interior is finished and fitted up in the regular orthodox manner, the chief ornamental feature being an elaborate mosaic reredos, representing the adoration of the shepherds at Bethlehem; it was executed by Salviati from   designs by Mr. Butterfield. 
   <P><num value="1">One</num> of the most interesting rooms in the palace is the <LEMMA id="lemma.508.5">Porteus library</LEMMA>, which contains an extensive collection of books, gathered by the divine whose name it bears; it has a large window opening upon the lawn and overlooking the river. Some thousands of volumes, mostly on theological and religious subjects, fill up its ample shelves. There are collections of sermons in abundance, commentaries on the gospels, black-letter Bibles, and a large number of theological works. All around suggests meditation and repose.   On <num value="1">one</num> side of the room   the windows are emblazoned with the armorial bearings of the different prelates, and on its walls hang the portraits of all the Bishops of London since the Reformation. 
    <P> <QUOTE>All are there,</QUOTE> writes Bishop Blomfield's son in the Life of his father- <QUOTE>Ridley, the martyr; Sandys and Grindal; the ambitious Laud; Juxon, the friend of Charles I.; Compton, who had adorned the palace gardens with those rare and stately trees; the statesman Robinson; the learned Gibson; the divines Sherlock and Lowth; the mild and amiable <LEMMA id="lemma.509.1">Porteus</LEMMA>, who loved   Fulham so well, and thanked God the evening before his death that he had been suffered to return thither to die; and Howley and Blomfield.</QUOTE> <pb id="P.509" n="509"> 
    <P>The great drawing-room   and the dining-room are large and handsome apartments on the east side of the palace, with windows looking out upon the lawn and gardens. This part of the building dates from the time of Bishop Terrick, who was appointed to the see in <datestruct value="1764--"><year reg="1764">1764</year></datestruct>. It has since been considerably altered and repaired at different times.  It is a long, plain brick structure of <num value="2">two</num> storeys, its only ornamentation being an embattled summit. 
    <P>The palace was considerably altered in appearance early in the last century. Bishop Robinson, in <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct>, presented a petition to the Archbishop of Canterbury, stating that <QUOTE>the manor-house, or palace, of Fulham was grown very old and ruinous, that it was much too large for the revenues of the bishopric, and that a great part of the building was become useless.</QUOTE> In consequence of this petition, as Lysons tells us, certain commissioners  (among whom were Sir John Vanbrugh and Sir  Christopher Wren) were appointed to examine the premises. The purport of their report was, that <QUOTE>after taking down the bake-house and pastryhouse, which adjoined to the kitchen, and all the buildings to the northward of the great diningroom, there would be left between <num value="50">fifty</num> and <num value="60">sixty</num> rooms, besides the chapel, hall, and kitchen.</QUOTE> These being adjudged sufficient for the use of the bishop and his successors, a licence was granted to pull down the other buildings; and this, it appears, was carried into effect. The present kitchen is on the north side of the great quadrangle; it is a large high-pitched room, and the ceiling is enriched with stucco ornamentation of an ancient character. 
   <P>From the low situation of the palace and grounds, nuch inconvenience is at times felt when the rhames overflows its banks. A notable instance of this occurred in <datestruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>, when considerable damage was occasioned. In some of the rooms of the palace the flooring was upheaved and destroyed by the force of the water, whilst a very large part of the palace grounds was flooded for several days. 
  <P>The gardens are of great antiquity, and have been famous for their beauty and scientific culture since the time of Bishop Grindall, in the reign of   Queen Elizabeth.   It appears that Grindall got himself into some trouble by sending some fine grapes to the queen, with whom they disagreed, and the bishop was accused of having the plague in his house, an accusation which he disproved. 
  <P>According to Fuller's <QUOTE>Worthies,</QUOTE> it was Grindall who <num value="1">first</num> imported the tamarisk into this country.   This tree, writes Fuller, <QUOTE>hath not more affinity in sound with tamarind than sympathy in extraction, both originally Arabick; general similitude in leaves and operation; only tamarind in England is an annual, dying at the approach of winter, whilst tamarisk lasteth many years.   It was <num value="1">first</num> brought over by Bishop Grindall out of Switzerland, where he was exiled under Queen Mary, and planted in his garden at Fulham, in this county, where the soil being moist and fenny, well complied with the nature of this plant, which since is removed, and thriveth well in many other places.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The great gardener of the palace, however, was  Bishop Compton, who was banished to Fulham by  James II., and remained in the place for <num value="2">two</num> years, attending specially to his garden.   In this he planted many exotics and trees from   other countries, then almost unknown in England. A great cork-tree, now much decayed, but at <num value="1">one</num> time the largest in England, and also a large ilex, are traditionally said to have been planted by his hands. Bishop Blomfield planted a cedar of  Lebanon, which is now a fine tree, though, comparatively speaking but a few years old; but it can scarcely be said to rival its elder sisters. 
    <P>The grounds of the palace are remarkable for the thickness with which the trees are planted.  <num value="1">One</num> bishop having thinned them   considerably,  Lord Bacon wittily told him   that <QUOTE>having cut down such a cloud of trees, he must be a good man to throw light on dark places.</QUOTE> It may be added   that Sir William   Watson, who made a botanical survey of the grounds a <num value="100">hundred</num> years ago, speaks of this garden in the following terms, in a report to the Royal Society :-- <QUOTE>The famous  Botanical Garden at Fulham, wherein Dr. Henry  Compton, heretofore Bishop of London, planted a greater variety of curious exotic plants and trees than had at any time been collected in any garden in England.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Fond as Evelyn was of gardening, as we have already shown in our account of Saye's Court, Deptford,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="152">152</num>.</NOTE> it is not surprising that we find him a visitor here.

   <P>Among the curiosities at <num value="1">one</num> time to be seen in the palace was a whetstone, which was placed there by Bishop Porteus under somewhat singular circumstances.   The story, showing the bishop's success in a <QUOTE>competition in lying,</QUOTE> is thus told in the <hi rend=italics>New   Quarterly Magazine..-</hi>

   <P> <QUOTE>In Elizabethan times the game of brag was very popular.    <Q>Lying with us,</Q>  writes Lupton, in <datestruct value="1580--"><year reg="1580">1580</year></datestruct>,  <Q>is so loved and allowed, that there are <pb id="P.510" n="510"> many tymes gamings and prizes therefore, purposely to encourage <num value="1">one</num> to outlye another.</Q>  In the last century there were several organised Lying Clubs, <num value="1">one</num> of which for many years held its meetings at the  <Q>Bell Tavern,</Q>  Westminster.   Among   other rules of this society were the following:-- <Q> That whoever shall presume to speak a word of truth between the established hours of <num value="6">six</num> and <num value="10">ten</num>, within this worshipful society, without <num value="1">first</num> saying, <Q>By your leave, Mr. President,</Q> shall for every such offence forfeit <num value="1">one</num> gallon of such wine as the chairman shall think fit.</Q>  A coarser form of the same intellectual amusement is the custom of lying for the whetstone, which formerly obtained at village feasts in many parts of England. It was perhaps, some popular version of the story of King Priscus's whetstone cut through by a razor which caused this article to be selected as the appropriate prize; it may have been only an ingenious symbolism to express the necessary whetting of the wits; but, at any rate, it was the recognised emblem of lying, and is illustrated by a sarcasm of Lord Bacon upon Sir Kenelm Digby.   The latter, upon his return from   the Continent, was boasting of having seen the philosopher's stone.    <Q>Perhaps,</Q>

 said the Lord Keeper,  <Q>it was a whetstone.</Q>  At Coggeshall, in Essex, there was a famous institution of this kind. There is a story that Bishop Porteus once   stopped   in this town to change horses, and observing a great crowd in the streets, put his head out of the window to inquire the cause. A townsman standing near replied that it was the day upon which they gave the whetstone to the biggest liar. Shocked at such depravity, the good bishop proceeded to the scene of the competition, and lectured the crowd upon the enormity of the sin, concluding his discourse with the emphatic words,  <Q>I never told a lie in my life.</Q>  Whereupon the chief umpire exchanged a few words with his fellows, and approaching the carriage, said,  <Q>My lord, we unanimously adjudge you the prize!</Q>  and forthwith the highly objection- <pb id="P.511" n="511">

 <pb id="P.512" n="512"> able whetstone was thrust in   at the carriage window. Tradition adds, that in course of time the good-natured bishop forgot the indignity, and began to relish the joke, inasmuch as for many years the identical whetstone occupied the post of honour over the fire-place in his dining-room at Fulham.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The manor of Fulham, we may here state, is <num value="1">one</num> of the oldest in England, having been granted in <num value="631">631</num> , by the Bishop of Hereford, to Bishop  Erkenwald, of London, so that it has existed as an appanage of the see for upwards of <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> years. This manor was originally held by service of prayers and masses for the dead; but at a later period military service was exacted from all holders of manors. The only service now required from the Bishop of London is the maintenance of a watchman to guard the garden and grounds.  There is every reason to believe that the manorhouse here was occupied at the time of the  Conquest; but the <num value="1">first</num> mention of this was in the account of the capture of Robert de Sigillo,  Bishop of London, who was a partisan of the  Empress Maud, and was made prisoner and held to ransom by the followers of Stephen. Bishop  Richard de Gravesend resided much at Fulham, and died here in <datestruct value="1303--"><year reg="1303">1303</year></datestruct>. His successor, Richard  Baldock, who was Lord Chancellor of England, dates most of his public acts from Fulham Palace; but Bishop Braybroke, who enjoyed the same high office, and presided over the see of London nearly <num value="20">twenty</num> years, seems to have spent but little of his time at this place, as he resided mostly at Stepney.  Lysons, in his <QUOTE>Environs of London,</QUOTE> says that <QUOTE>of Bishop Bonner's residence at Fulham, and of his cruelties, some facts are recorded in history, and many traditions are yet current.   A   large wooden chair, in which he is said to have sat to pass sentence upon heretics,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>was placed, a few years ago, in a shrubbery near the palace, which gave occasion to an elegant poem, written by Miss Hannah More, who was then on a visit at the bishop's.</QUOTE> This poem, called <QUOTE>Bishop  Bonner's Ghost,</QUOTE> was printed at the Earl of Oxford's private press at Strawberry Hill.   <num value="1">One</num> deprived bishop of the English Church, John Byrde (who was the last <QUOTE>provincial</QUOTE> of the Carmelites, and afterwards became Bishop of Chester), seems to have found an asylum with Bonner, and was living with him at Fulham in <datestruct value="1555--"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct>. <QUOTE>Upon his coming,</QUOTE> says Anthony Wood, in his <QUOTE>Athenae Oxonienses,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>he brought his present with him--a dish of apples and a bottle of wine.</QUOTE> Bishop Aylmer, or Elmer, was principally resident at Fulham Palace, where he died in <datestruct value="1594--"><year reg="1594">1594</year></datestruct>. The zeal with which he supported the interests of the Established Church exposed him to the resentment of the Puritans, who, among other methods which they took to injure the bishop, attempted to prejudice the queen against him, alleging that he had committed great waste at Fulham by cutting down the elms; and, punning upon his name, they gave him the appellation of Bishop Mar-elm; <QUOTE>but it was a shameful untruth,</QUOTE> says Strype, <QUOTE>and how false it was all the court knew, and the queen herself could witness, for she had lately lodged at the palace, where she misliked nothing, but that her lodgings were kept from all good prospect by the thickness of the trees, as she told her vice-chamberlain, and he reported the same to the bishop.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Fulham   Palace has been honoured with the presence of royalty on several occasions. Norden says that Henry III. often lay there.   Bishop  Bancroft here received a visit from Queen Elizabeth in <datestruct value="1600--"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>, and another <num value="2">two</num> years later. King James likewise visited him previously to his coronation.  In <datestruct value="1627--"><year reg="1627">1627</year></datestruct>, Charles I. and his queen dined here with  Bishop Mountaigne. 
    <P>During the Civil Wars we find that most of the principal inhabitants of Fulham, as might have been expected, were staunch Royalists. <num value="1">One</num> of the most prominent was the Bishop (Juxon) who attended his royal master on the scaffold, and to whom the king addressed his last mysterious word, <QUOTE>Remember!</QUOTE> Juxon was deprived of his see, and the manor and palace of Fulham were sold to  Colonel Edward Harvey, in <datestruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct>. The bishop then retired to his own house at Compton, in  Gloucestershire, where he had the singular good fortune to remain undisturbed until the Restoration.  With reference to this fact, old Fuller quaintly remarks:-- <QUOTE>For in this particular he was happy above others of his order, that whereas they may be said in some sort to have left their bishoprics, flying into the king's quarters for safety, <hi rend=italics>he</hi> stayed at home till his bishopric left <hi rend=italics>him</hi>, roused him from his swan's nest at Fulham, for a bird of another feather to build therein.</QUOTE> It should be mentioned here that a large tithe-barn which stands in the palace grounds was built by Colonel Harvey during his temporary tenure of the place under the Commonwealth.   On a beam over the doors is carved the date, <datestruct value="1654"><year reg="1654">1654</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>The moat which encompasses the palace grounds is about a mile in circumference, and has been considered by some antiquaries to have been formed by the Danish army, when they were encamped in this neighbourhood in <datestruct value="1879--"><year reg="1879">1879</year></datestruct>. Mr. Blomfield, in his <QUOTE>Olden Times of Fulham,</QUOTE> observes: <QUOTE>As winter <pb id="P.513" n="513"> came on, it is not improbable that they [the Danes] found the high tides encroaching seriously on their position; and not liking to leave the river and run the risk of being cut off from their ships, they set vigorously to work, and. threw up a bank with a ditch along the river-flank of their army. The work once begun would not be hastily relinquished. Having to pass the winter in a hostile country, they would naturally be anxious to fortify their position by carrying the ditch round the whole camp.   The Danish army gone, it was not likely that any bishop would be at the expense of levelling the banks and filling up a ditch of such magnitude, enclosing as it does, and protecting from the river, a space of ground in the centre of his manor most convenient for making a residence.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Enveloped as its origin is in mystery, it is certain, from existing documents, that this moat has been the subject of various disputes, and a cause of annoyance, or at least of discomfort, to many successive bishops. In <datestruct value="1618--"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct>, Dr. Edwardes, Chancellor of the diocese of London, left <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure>, <QUOTE>towards erecting a sluice to communicate with the river Thames, to preserve the moat from noisomeness.</QUOTE> Before this, the water was never changed; the moat was only filled by the water which filtered in through the banks, and stood stagnant from years' end to years' end.   After the formation of the sluice, the water was changed once a month. To cleanse this immense moat, to make additional sluices, to replace the river embankments, to raise by several feet a water-meadow of many acres, to renew all the fences, and to put the whole of a neglected estate into a condition of perfect order, appeared in Bishop Blomfield's eyes a duty laid upon him as a trustee of Church property, and in the discharge of that duty he spent as much as <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>. 
   <P>At a short distance westward of the palace stands Craven Cottage, a charming retreat by the waterside.   It was originally built for the Countess of Craven, afterwards Margravine of Anspach, but has been considerably altered and enlarged by subsequent proprietors.   After the   Margravine, the cottage was for some years the residence of Mr. Denis O&lsquo;Brien, the friend of Charles James Fox, and in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct> it was sold to.a Sir Robert Barclay.   Mr. Walsh Porter, who was its next occupant, is said to have spent a large sum   in altering and embellishing it. About <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct> it became the residence of Sir E. Bulwer Lytton.   He was living here in <datestruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct>, when he entertained Prince Louis Napoleon at dinner, after his then recent escape from the fortress of Ham.   The house was at <num value="1">one</num> time the residence of a celebrated moneylender, who was generally known as <QUOTE>Jew King.</QUOTE> He was, as Captain Gronow tells us, in his amusing <QUOTE>Reminiscences,</QUOTE> a man of some talent, and had good taste in the fine arts.   He had made the peerage a complete study, knew the exact position of every <num value="1">one</num> who was connected with a coronet, the value of his property, how deeply the estates were mortgaged, and what encumbrances weighed upon them.   Nor did his knowledge stop there; by dint of sundry kind attentions to the clerks of the leading banking-houses, fhe was aware of the balances they kept, and the credit attached to their names, so that, to the surprise of the borrower, he let him into the secrets of his own actual position.   He gave excellent dinners, at which many of the highest personages of the realm were present; and when they fancied that they were about to meet individuals whom it would be upon their conscience to recognise elsewhere, were not a little amused to find clients quite as highly placed as themselves, and with purses quite as empty. King had a well-appointed house in Clarges Street, Piccadilly; but it was here that his hospitalities were   most lavishly   and   luxuriously   exercised. Here it was that Sheridan told his host that he liked his dinner-table better than his multiplication table; to which his host, who was not only witty, but often the cause of wit in others, replied, <QUOTE>I know, Mr. Sheridan, your taste is more for Jo-king than for Jew King,</QUOTE> alluding to the admirable performance of the actor, King, in Sheridan's <hi rend=italics>School for Scandal.</hi>

    <P>Craven Cottage, as left by Walsh Porter in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, was considered the prettiest specimen of cottage architecture then existing.   The <num value="3">three</num> principal reception-rooms are described   as having been equally remarkable for their structure as well as their furniture. <QUOTE>The centre, or principal saloon,</QUOTE> Croker tells us in his <QUOTE>Walk from   London to  Fulham,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>was supported by palm-trees of considerable size, exceedingly   well executed, with their drooping foliage at the top, supporting the cornice and architraves of the room. The other decorations were in corresponding taste   ...  This room   led   to a large Gothic dining-room of very considerable   dimensions, and   on   the front of the former apartment was a very large oval rustic balcony, opposed   to which was a large   half-circular library, that became   more celebrated afterwards as the room in which the highly-gifted and   talented   author of  <Q>Pelham</Q>  wrote some of his most celebrated works.</QUOTE> Along the Thames side of the house a raised terrace was constructed, and the grounds were laid out with great taste. <pb id="P.514" n="514"> 
   <P>Continuing our course westward a short distance farther, we come to a house known as the <QUOTE>Crab Tree,</QUOTE> which has long been familiar to all Thames oarsmen, amateurs and professionals alike.   The crab is the indigenous apple-tree of this country, and its abundance in this neighbourhood formerly gave its name to the adjoining part of the parish. Faulkner, in his <QUOTE>History of Fulham,</QUOTE> remarks that <QUOTE>it has been said by some ancient people that Queen Elizabeth had a country seat here. Some few years ago,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>a very ancient outbuilding belonging to Mr. Eayres fell to the ground through age. Upon clearing away the rubbish, the workmen discovered, in the corner of a chimney, a black-letter Bible, handsomely bound and ornamented with the arms of Queen Elizabeth, in good preservation.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Early in the present century a villa was built on the banks of the Thames, near the <QUOTE>Crab Tree,</QUOTE> for the Earl of Cholmondeley. The design for the edifice was taken from a villa in Switzerland, which his lordship had seen on his travels. The house was built chiefly of wood, of the earl's own growing, and the interior was principally fitted up with cedar of the largest growth ever produced in this country. The exterior was covered with coloured slates, having nearly the same appearance and solidity as stone. The front next the river was ornamented with a colonnade, extending the whole length of the building, and thatched with reeds, to correspond with the roof. The house, however, has long since been pulled down. 
    <P>Passing up Crab Tree Lane, and returning to the village by the Hammersmith and Fulham Road, we pass on our left the cemetery for the parish of  Fulham, which was opened in <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>. It is laid out in Fulham Fields, and covers several acres of land which had previously served to rear fruit and vegetables.   The land all around for a considerable distance, stretching away towards Hammersmith and North End, is still covered with market-gardens, excepting here and there where a few modern buildings have been erected. Among these is the St.  James's Home and Penitentiary, which was originally established at Whetstone. 
    <P>Continuing our course eastward, we reach the  High Street, which extends from the London-or rather Fulham--Road to Church Row.   This thoroughfare appears at <num value="1">one</num> time to have been called Bear Street, and in the more ancient parishbooks it is denominated Fulham Street. 
    <P>The old <QUOTE>Golden Lion,</QUOTE> in this street, which was pulled down only a few years ago to make room for a new public-house bearing the same sign, is closely connected by tradition with the annals of the palace. The old house, which dated back to the reign of Henry VII., is said to have been the residence of Bishop Bonner, and when converted into an inn, to have been frequented by Shakespeare, Fletcher, and   other literary celebrities. Bishop Bonner, according to <num value="1">one</num> account, died at Fulham in his arm-chair, smoking tobacco; and the late Mr. Crofton Croker, in a paper read by him before the British Archaeological Association at Warwick, tried to show that an ancient tobacco-pipe, of Elizabethan pattern, found, <hi rend=italics>in situ</hi>, in the course of some alterations made in <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>, was the veritable pipe of that right reverend prelate!      Strange stories are told of a subterranean passage which existed, it is said, between this house and the palace.   On the pulling down of the old <QUOTE>Golden Lion,</QUOTE> the panelling was purchased by the <num value="2">second</num> Lord Ellenborough, for the fitting up of his residence, Southam House, near Cheltenham. 
    <P>The Workhouse formerly stood on the east side of the High Street. It was built in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, but had been in a dilapidated condition for many years, and was pulled down about <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>; a large building to be used as the Union for the joint parishes of Fulham   and Hammersmith having been erected in Fulham   Fields.   Cipriani, the   distinguished Florentine painter, lived for some time in a house adjoining the old workhouse; he died in London in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>In order to gain some idea of what the external appearance of Fulham was at the commencement of the last century, we have only to suppose ourselves carried back to that date, and to be walking through the village with old Master Bowack, the author of a <QUOTE>History of Fulham</QUOTE> published about that time. We shall observe, as he tells us, <QUOTE>that the houses are commonly neat and well built of brick, and from the gate of the Queen's Road run along on both sides of the way almost as far as the church. Also from the Thames side into the town stands an entire range of buildings, and upon the passage leading to the church, called Church Lane, are several very handsome airy houses.   But the buildings run farthest towards the north, extending themselves into a street through which lies the road a very considerable way towards Hammersmith.  Besides, there are several other handsome buildings towards the east, called the Back Lane, and a great number of gardeners' houses scattered in the several remote parts of the parish.</QUOTE> Judging from the above description, a visitor to Fulham now would find that the locality has undergone (in external appearance, at least) marvellously little alteration during the time that has elapsed since it was written. <QUOTE>Except that the Back Lane has <pb id="P.515" n="515"> apparently lost most of its architectural gems, and that Elysium Row has sprung into existence and grown old and venerable since then,</QUOTE> writes Mr. Blomfield, in his work above quoted, <QUOTE>the principal features of the town (whitewash and stucco apart) appear to be much the same. The aspect of the river-side was, of course, very different. The bridge was not built till <datestruct value="20"><year reg="20">twenty</year></datestruct> years later, and the road came down to the bank, and, indeed, in a pleasant green, on <num value="1">one</num> side of which stood the old  <Q>Swan</Q>  Inn, and the other side was overshadowed by elm-trees.   A   clump of trees stood at <num value="1">one</num> corner of the road, above which rose the tower of the church, with its leaden spire, and at the riverside lay the ferry-boat, waiting for passengers. Fulham was then a point for pleasure-parties on the water, as Richmond and Kew are now. In comparing our appearance now with what it was then,</QUOTE> continues Mr. Blomfield, <QUOTE>we must not, of course, venture beyond the pump at the end of High Street, and get entangled in the mushroom growth of semi-detached villas which have been for years slowly but relentlessly driving   back the struggling market-gardener from point to point into the river. We must think of the London Road as it wasat that time, not bordered by comfortable houses, rows of snug-looking whitewashed villas, smart public-houses, or red-brick hospitals, but with a yawning ditch on each side, and, beyond these, green fields and garden-grounds, hedges and orchards, and now and then a clump of elms and a farmhouse or a gardener's cottage peeping through; for as to regular roadside houses, you would not pass a score between Fulham   Pump and Hyde Park. Nor must we forget that the traveller would observe between Fulham and London certainly not less than <num value="3">three</num> gallows-trees, bearing their ghastly fruit of highwaymen hung in chains. Then the road itself was very different from what it is now: the only idea at that time of making a good road was to pave it, and, accordingly, the Fulham Road was paved, but only in <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> places; till, at length, what with part being badly paved, and part left unpaved, and deep in its native mud; what with the narrowness of the way in many places, and the depth of the ditches on each side, the road grew so dangerous that, a few years later, it was found necessary to take the matter up in Parliament.   It then appeared that a rate of <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> in the pound was not considered sufficient to put the road into a safe state; that it was almost impassable in winter; and that a great deal of mischief had been done to persons who travelled on that road.</QUOTE> If this were so, the state of the road will almost seem to justify the derivation of the name of the village as the <hi rend=italics>Foul-</hi>
ham.<NOTE>See  p. <num value="505">505</num>.</NOTE>

    <P>Seeing the Fulham Road as it is now, swarming with omnibuses and butchers' carts, carriages, and coal-wagons, it is very difficult to imagine its condition a century and a half ago, with perhaps <QUOTE>a solitary market-wagon toiling through the mud, or drawing to <num value="1">one</num> side, at the imminent risk of sliding into the ditch, to allow the Duchess of Munsterwho lived in a large mansion near the entrance to the village--to pass by in her great lumbering coach and <num value="6">six</num>, tearing along at the dangerous rate of <num value="5">five</num> miles an hour!</QUOTE> But bad as the Fulham Road was in the olden time, the inconvenience of having to travel over it was, to Bishop Laud, at least, an advantage; for, as we have already had occasion to mention in our account of Whitehall,<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="353">353</num>.</NOTE> in <num value="1">one</num> of his letters to Lord Strafford, alluding to his health as not being so good as it was formerly, he expresses a regret that in consequence of his elevation to the see of Canterbury he has now simply to glide across the river in his barge, when on his way either to the Court or the Star-Chamber; whereas, when  Bishop of London, there were <num value="5">five</num> miles of rough road between Fulham   Palace and Whitehall, the jolting over which in his coach he describes as having been very beneficial to his health. 
    <P>Holcrofts, which stands on the left side of the Fulham   Road, as we pass from the top of the High Street, dates from the early part of the last century, when it was built oy Robert Limpany, a wealthy merchant of London, whose estate in this parish was so considerable that, as Bowack tells us, <QUOTE>he was commonly called the Lord of Fulham.</QUOTE> The house, which formerly had a long avenue of trees in front of it, was sold to Sir William Withers, in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, and became afterwards successively the residence of Sir Martin Wright, <num value="1">one</num> of the Justices of the King's Bench, and of the Earl of Ross. The building was subsequently known as Holcrofts Hall, and was for some time occupied by Sir John Burgoyne, who here gave some clever dramatic performances.   Here it was that the celebrated Madame Vestris lived, after her marriage with Charles Mathews, the well-known actor, and here she died in <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>, at which time the house was called Gore Lodge. 
   <P>Holcrofts Priory, on the opposite side of the road, was built about the year <datestruct value="1845"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>, on the site of an old Elizabethan mansion called   Claybrooke House, from a wealthy family of that name who owned the property in the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. <num value="1">One</num> of the family was buried in Fulham Church in <pb id="P.516" n="516"> <datestruct value="1587--"><year reg="1587">1587</year></datestruct>. Claybrooke House was in the occupation of the Frewens at the commencement of the last century, and afterwards became the property of the above-mentioned   Robert Limpany.   For many years prior to its demolition it was used as a seminary for young ladies. 
   <P>In Elysium   Road, near the High Street, is a large and handsome ecclesiastical-looking edifice, in the Gothic style. This is an Orphanage Home, under the patronage of the Bishop of London, founded a few years ago by Mrs. Tait, the wife of Bishop (since Archbishop) Tait. 
   <P>In Burlington Road, formerly known as Back Lane, the thoroughfare running parallel with the High Street on its eastern   side, and extending from the corner of Fulham Road to King's Road, Fulham   Almshouses originally stood; they were founded, as already stated, by Sir William Powell, in <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>, but rebuilt near the parish church in <datestruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct>. Burlington House, whence the road derives its name, was for upwards of a century a well-known academy kept at <num value="1">one</num> time by a Mr. Roy. On the grounds attached to the house is now a Reformatory School for Females; it was built about <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>Farther along the Fulham Road, on the north 
<FIGURE id="Fig.516" n="2000.14.0193"><HEAD>Holcrofts And The Priory, Fulham.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 side, stands Munster House, which is supposed to owe its name to Melesina Schulenberg, who was created by George I., in <datestruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>, Duchess of Munster. According to Faulkner, it was at <num value="1">one</num> time called 
<hi rend=italics>Mustow</hi> House; but as Mr. Croker suggests, in his <QUOTE>Walk from London to Fulham,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>this was not improbably the duchess's pronunciation.</QUOTE> Faulkner adds that tradition makes this house a hunting-seat of Charles II., and asserts that an extensive park was attached to it; but there seems to be no foundation for the statement. In the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century the property seems to have belonged to the Powells, from whom it passed into the possession of Sir John Williams, Bart., of Pengethly, Monmouthshire.   In <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, Lysons tells us, the house was occupied as a school; and in <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct> Faulkner informs us that it was the residence of M. Sampayo, a Portuguese merchant.   It was afterwards for many years tenanted by <LEMMA id="lemma.517.1">Mr. John Wilson Croker, M.P.</LEMMA>, Secretary of the Admiralty, and whose name is well known as the editor of <QUOTE>Boswell's Johnson.</QUOTE> About <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct> Mr. Croker resigned Munster House as a residence, <QUOTE>after having externally decorated it with various Cockney embattlements of brick, and collected there many <pb id="P.517" n="517"> curious works of art, possibly with a view of reconstruction.</QUOTE> On the gate-piers were formerly <num value="2">two</num> grotesque-looking composition lions, which had the popular effect, for some time, of changing the name to <hi rend=italics>Monster</hi> House. 
   <P>On the opposite side of the road is an extensive garden for the supply of the London market, by the side of which runs Munster Road, whence a turning about half-way down leads on to Parson's Green. Fulham Lodge, which stood on the south side of the main road, close by Munster Terrace, was a favourite retreat of the Duke of York, and for some time the home of George Colman the Younger.   Fulham   Park Road covers the spot whereon the lodge stood. 
   <P>Continuing along the Fulham   Road about a quarter of a mile, we reach Percy Cross, or rather, as it was formerly called, Purser's Cross. Here Lord Ravensworth has a suburban residence, in the garden of which is a fine specimen of an old <QUOTE>stone pine,</QUOTE> reminding us of Virgil's line- 
                 <QUOTE REND=blockquote> Pulcherrina pinus in hortis.</QUOTE>

 is small and unostentatious, yet. in reality, it is more capacious and attractive than it looks.   The Queen and Prince Albert honoured the late Lord Ravensworth with a visit here in <datestruct VALUE="1840-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>. The grounds at the back ot the house owe their charm   to a former occupier, Mr. John Ord, a Master in Chancery, who about the middle of the last century planted them   with such skill and taste that, though not extensive, they held a foremost rank among the private gardens in the neighbourhood of London. 
   <P> <QUOTE>Purser's Cross</QUOTE> is mentioned as a point <QUOTE>on the Fulham Road, between Parson's Green and Walham Green,</QUOTE> so far back as <datestruct value="1602--"><year reg="1602">1602</year></datestruct>; and the place has never been in any way connected with the <QUOTE>proud house of Percy.</QUOTE> In the <QUOTE>Beauties of England and Wales,</QUOTE> Purser's Cross is said to be a corruption of Parson's Cross, and   the vicinity of Parson's Green is mentioned in support of this conjecture.   However, that <QUOTE>Purser,</QUOTE> and not <QUOTE>Percy</QUOTE> Cross, has been for many years the usual mode of writing the name of this locality, is established by an entry in the <QUOTE>Annual Register</QUOTE> in <datestruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct>. At Percy Cross was at <num value="1">one</num> time the residence of Signor Mario and Madame Grisi. <pb id="P.518" n="518"> 
  <P>On the opposite side of the road to Lord Ravensworth's house is Walham Lodge, formerly called   Park Cottage, a modern, well-built house, standing within extensive grounds, surrounded by a brick wall. Here for some years lived Mr. Brande, the eminent chemist, whose lectures on geology, delivered at the Royal Institution in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, acquired great popularity. 
    <P>A house, now divided into <num value="2">two</num>, and called Dungannon House and Albany Lodge, abuts upon the western boundary of Walham Lodge. Tradition asserts that this united cottage and villa were, previous to their separation, known by the name of Bolingbroke Lodge, and as such became the frequent resort of Pope, Gay, Swift, and others of that fraternity; but it would seem as if tradition had mixed up this house with Bolingbroke House,  Battersea, which we have lately described.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="470">470</num>.</NOTE>

    <P>A few yards from   Dungannon House, on the same side of the road, opposite to Parson's Green  Lane, stands Arundel House, an old mansion, supposed to date from the Tudor period. It appears to have been newly fronted towards the close of the last century; and in <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct> the house was in the occupation of the late Mr. Hallam, the historian of the Middle Ages 
    <P>On the opposite side of the road is the carriage entrance to Park House, which stands in Parson's  Green Lane. A stone tablet let into <num value="1">one</num> of the piers of the gateway is inscribed, <QUOTE>Purser's Cross,  <datestruct VALUE="1738-08-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> This date has reference to the death of a highwayman which occurred here, and of which the <hi rend=italics>London Magazine</hi> gives the following particulars :-- <QUOTE>An highwayman having committed several robberies on Finchley Common, was pursued to London, where he thought himself safe, but was, in a little time, discovered at a publichouse in Burlington Gardens, refreshing himself and his horse; however, he had time to re-mount, and rode through Hyde Park, in which there were several gentlemen's servants airing their horses, who, taking the alarm, pursued him closely as far as Fulham Fields, where, finding no probability of escaping, he threw money among some country people who were at work in the field, and told them they would soon see the end of an unfortunate man.   He had no sooner spoke these words but he pulled out a pistol, clapped it to his ear, and shot himself directly, before his pursuers could prevent him.   The coroner's inquest brought in their verdict, and he was buried in a cross-road, with a stake through him; but it was not known who he was.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Park House, in Parson's Green Lane, is said to be a fac-simile of an older mansion, called Quibus Hall, which occupied the same site. The old hall at <num value="1">one</num> time belonged to the Whartons.   Lysons, on the authority of the parish books, states that a Sir Michael Wharton was living here in <datestruct value="1654--"><year reg="1654">1654</year></datestruct>. When the house was rebuilt, it was for a time called High Elms House.   A small house opposite, Audley Cottage, was for many years the residence of the late Mr. Thomas Crofton Croker, F.S.A., who wrote a minute description of the place, which is reprinted in the <QUOTE>Walk from London to Fulham,</QUOTE> to which we are indebted for some of the particulars here given.   The name of the place, which was at <num value="1">one</num> time Brunswick Cottage, was altered by Mr. Croker to Rosamond's Bower, the property hereabouts having at some distant date formed part of a manorial estate called Rosamonds, which in the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century belonged to Sir Henry Wharton. Lysons, in his <QUOTE>Environs of London,</QUOTE> states that <QUOTE>the site of the mansion belonging to this estate, now (<datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>) rented by a gardener, is said, by tradition, to have been a palace of Fair Rosamond.</QUOTE> This house was taken down about the year <datestruct value="1825"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, and the stables of Park House built on the site. With reference to the present building, an ordinary <num value="2">two</num>-storeyed dwelling-house, Mr. Croker wrote : <QUOTE>When I took my cottage, in <datestruct value="1837--"><year reg="1837">1837</year></datestruct>, and was told that the oak staircase in it had belonged to the veritable  <Q>Rosamond's Bower,</Q>  and was the only relic of it that existed, and when I found that the name had no longer a precise  <Q>local habitation</Q>  in Fulham, I ventured, purely from motives of respect for the memory of the past, and not from any affectation of romance, to revive an ancient parochial name, which had been suffered to die out  <Q> like the snuff of a candle.</Q>  In changing its precise situation, in transferring it from <num value="1">one</num> side of Parson's Green Lane to the other--a distance, however, not <num value="50">fifty</num> yards from the original site--I trust when called upon to show cause for the transfer to be reasonably supported by the history of the old oak staircase.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Parson's Green is a triangular plot of ground at the southern end of the lane, at its junction with King's Road; and it was so called from the parsonage-house of the parish of Fulham, which stood on its west side, but was pulled down about the year <datestruct value="1740"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>. The Green, on which successive rectors and their families disported themselves, is for the most part surrounded by small cottages.   There used to be held on the Green annually on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, a fair, which had, as Faulkner tells us, <QUOTE>been established from time immemorial.</QUOTE>

 Seeing, however, that <QUOTE>Clarissa Harlowe</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>Sir Charles Grandison</QUOTE> were both written between <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>, and that Richardson did not take up his abode here till <datestruct value="1755"><year reg="1755">1755</year></datestruct>, it is North End, and not Parson's Green, that may lay claim to being the seat of their production.   Edwards, the author of <QUOTE>Canons of Criticism,</QUOTE> died at Parson's Green in <datestruct value="1757--"><year reg="1757">1757</year></datestruct>, whilst on a visit to Richardson. 
   <P>A century or <num value="2">two</num> ago Parson's Green was noted for its aristocratic residents.   East End House, on the east side, was built at the end of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num>   century for Sir Francis Child, who   was Lord Mayor of London in <datestruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct>.   The house was inhabited by Admiral Sir Charles Wager; and by Dr. Ekins, Dean of Carlisle, who died there in <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>.   Mrs. Fitzherbert was at <num value="1">one</num> time a resident here; and, according   to   Mr. Croker, she erected the porch in front of the house as a shelter for carriages. Here, naturally enough, the Prince of Wales (afterwards George IV.) was a frequent visitor. Madame Piccolomini, too, lived for some time   on the east side of the Green. 
    <P>Another distinguished resident at Parson's Green in former times was Sir Thomas Bodley, the founder of the Bodleian Library at Oxford.   Rowland White, Lord Strafford's entertaining and communicative correspondent, was his contemporary there. <QUOTE>When the great Lord Chancellor Bacon fell into disgrace, and was restrained from coming within the verge of the Court, he procured a licence (dated <datestruct VALUE="1621-09-13"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=13>13</day>, <year reg=1621>1621</year></datestruct>) to retire for <num value="6">six</num> weeks to the house of his friend, Lord Chief-Justice Vaughan, at Parson's Green.</QUOTE> So wrote Lysons in <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>; but Faulkner says, <QUOTE>This could not be the Sir John Vaughan who was Lord Chief-Justice in <datestruct value="1668--"><year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>. We know of no other who was Lord Chief-Justice.   In the parish books,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>the person to whose house Lord Bacon retired is called  <Q>The Lord Vaughan,</Q>  who probably resided in the house now (<datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>) occupied by Mr. Maxwell, as a boarding-school, and called Albion House, a spacious mansion, built in that style of architecture which prevailed at the commencement of the reign of James I.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Close by Parson's Green is another open space, called Eelbrook Common, which <QUOTE>from time immemorial</QUOTE> has been used as a place of recreation for the dwellers in the neighbourhood. This plot of ground recently became the subject of a question in the House of Commons, in consequence of encroachments made upon it, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, as lords of the manor, having disposed of some portion of it for building purposes, thus encroaching on the rights of the public. 
   <P>On the south-west side of the Green, near Eelbrook Common, is Peterborough House, formerly the residence of the Mordaunts, Earls of Peterborough, whom we have already mentioned in our account of Fulham Church. 
   <P>The present building, a modern structure, dating from the end of the last century, has replaced an older mansion, which is described by Bowack as <QUOTE>a very large, square, regular pile of brick, with a gallery all round it upon the top of the roof. It had,</QUOTE> he continues, <QUOTE>abundance of extraordinary good rooms, with fine paintings.</QUOTE> The gardens and grounds covered about <num value="20">twenty</num> acres, and were beautifully laid out, after the fashion of the period. Swift, in <num value="1">one</num> of his letters, speaks of Lord Peterborough's gardens as being the finest he had ever seen about London. The ancient building was known as Brightwells, or Rightwells, and was the residence of John Tarnworth, <num value="1">one</num> of Queen Elizabeth's Privy Councillors, who died here in <datestruct value="1569--"><year reg="1569">1569</year></datestruct>. The place afterwards belonged to Sir Thomas Knolles, who sold it to Sir Thomas Smith, Master of the Court of Requests. He died here in <datestruct value="1609--"><year reg="1609">1609</year></datestruct>, <pb id="P.520" n="520"> and his widow soon afterwards married the <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Exeter, whilst Sir Thomas's only daughter married the Honourable Thomas Carey, the Earl of Monmouth's <num value="2">second</num> son, who, in right of his wife, became possessor of the estate. After him, the place was named Villa Carey. In <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, Villa Carey was occupied by Lord Mordaunt, who had married the daughter and heiress of Mr. Carey. This Lord Mordaunt took a prominent part in bringing about the restoration of Charles II., after which event he seems to have quietly settled down on his estate at Parson's Green, where he died in <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>. John Evelyn, in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date of <datestruct VALUE="1661-11-29"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=29>29</day>, <year reg=1661>1661</year></datestruct>, thus makes mention of a visit to Lord Mordaunt:-- <QUOTE>I dined at the Countess of Peterborow's, and went that evening to Parson Greene's house with my Lord Mordaunt, with whom   I staid that night.</QUOTE> By <QUOTE>Parson Greene's house,</QUOTE> Evelyn no doubt meant Parson's Green House. Later on, <datestruct VALUE="1675-12-2"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=2>2nd</day>, <year reg=1675>1675</year></datestruct>, Evelyn makes the following (more correct) entry in his <QUOTE>Diary :</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>I visited Lady Mordaunt at Parson's Green, her son being sick.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Lord   Mordaunt's son, Charles, subsequently known as Earl of Monmouth, distinguished himself 
<FIGURE id="Fig.520" n="2000.14.0195"><HEAD>Peterborough House.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 as a military character prior to the Revolution, and also in the reigns of William and Mary and Queen Anne.   He succeeded to the earldom   of Peterborough on the death of his uncle in <datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>. He was twice married: his <num value="2">second</num> wife was the accomplished singer, Anastasia Robinson, who survived him. The earl was visited at Peterborough House by all the wits and <hi rend=italics>literati</hi> of his time, including Pope, Swift, Locke, and many others. Faulkner, in his <QUOTE>History of Fulham,</QUOTE> says that Miss Robinson <QUOTE>continued to sing in the Opera till the year <datestruct value="1723"><year reg="1723">1723</year></datestruct>, when she retired, in consequence, as it is supposed, of her marriage with the Earl of Peterborough, for she at that time went to reside at a house in Parson's Green, which the earl took for herself and her mother.</QUOTE> Sir John Hawkins, in his <QUOTE>History of Music,</QUOTE> says she resided at Peterborough House, and presided at the earl's table, but she never lived under the same roof with him till she was prevailed on to attend him in a journey, which he took a few years before his death, on account of his declining health.   During her residence at Fulham she was visited by persons of the highest rank, under a full persuasion, founded on the general tenor of his life and conduct, that <pb id="P.521" n="521"> she had a legal right to a rank which, for prudential reasons, she was content to decline. She held frequent musical parties, at which Bononcini, Martini, Tosi, Greene, and the most eminent musicians of that time assisted; and they were attended by all the fashionable world.   It was some years before the earl could prevail upon himself to acknowledge her as his countess; nor did he, till <datestruct value="1735"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, publicly own what most people knew before; he then proclaimed his marriage like no other husband. He went <num value="1">one</num> evening to the rooms at Bath, where a servant was ordered distinctly and audibly to announce <QUOTE>Lady Peterborough's carriage waits!</QUOTE> Every lady of rank immediately rose and congratulated the declared countess. 
   <P>After Lord Peterborough's death, the house was sold to a Mr. Heaviside, from whom it was subsequently purchased by Mr. John Meyrick, father of Sir Samuel Meyrick, the well-known antiquary and writer on armour. He pulled the old mansion down, and built the present house on the site. 
   <P>It is recorded in Faulkner's <QUOTE>History of Kensington,</QUOTE> that in a vineyard at Parson's Green some Burgundy grapes were ripe in <datestruct VALUE="1765-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, and that the owner of the vineyard was about to make wine from them, as he did yearly. 
   <P>King's Road, which skirts the southern side of the Green, leads direct eastward on to Chelsea, and passing westward unites with Church Street, at the end of Burlington Road. At a short distance from the Green, in the King's Road, stands Ivy Cottage, which was built at the end of the last century by Walsh Porter, and is in a debased Gothic style of architecture. Faulkner states that <QUOTE>there is a tradition that on the site of this bijou of a cottage was formerly a house, the residence of Oliver Cromwell, which was called the Old Red Ivy House.</QUOTE> The house was for some time the residence of the late Mr. E. T. Smith, the well-known theatrical manager, who gave it the name of Drury Lodge, after the theatre of which he was then the lessee. The house, several years ago, resumed its old name of Ivy Cottage.   Here, in <datestruct value="1878--"><year reg="1878">1878</year></datestruct>, died the Rev. R. G. Baker, who was many years Vicar of Fulham, and well known as an antiquary. 
   <P>In   Church Street (formerly Windsor Street, according to Faulkner) stand the Fulham Charity Schools, which were erected in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>. Close by is a pottery, which has existed here for upwards of <num value="2">two</num> centuries. It was established by John Dwight, who, after numerous experiments, took out a patent, dated <datestruct VALUE="1671-04-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>, which was renewed in <datestruct value="1684--"><year reg="1684">1684</year></datestruct>, for the making of <QUOTE>earthenwares, known by the name of white goyes (pitchers), marbled porcelain vessels, statues and figures, and fine stone gorges never before made in England or elsewhere.</QUOTE> Another branch of industry at <num value="1">one</num> time carried on at Fulham was the manufacture of Gobelin   tapestry;   but the   articles produced were too costly to command a large sale. Mr. Smiles, in his <QUOTE>Huguenots,</QUOTE> writes: <QUOTE>A French refugee named Passavant purchased the tapestry manufactory at Fulham, originally established by the Walloons, which had greatly fallen into decay. His <num value="1">first</num> attempts at reviving the manufacture, however, were not successful, and so the industry was removed to Exeter.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Before leaving the village of Fulham, and making our way to Walham Green and North End, we may remark that this neighbourhood--if it has not always been remarkable for the healthiness or longevity of its inhabitants-can boast of having produced at least <num value="1">one</num> centenarian. In the <hi rend=italics>Mirror</hi>
for <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, we find this record: <QUOTE>Mr. Rench, of Fulham, who planted the elms in Birdcage Walk from saplings reared in his own nursery, died in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="101">101</num>, in the same room in which he had been born.</QUOTE>

<P>Having arrived at the end of the High Street, whence, at the commencement of the preceding chapter, we started on our tour towards the church and palace, we will now pass to the south side of the church, and thence shape our course along the river-side to the eastern boundary of the parish. The <num value="1">first</num> building to attract our attention is a stucco-fronted house, of Gothic design, standing <pb id="P.522" n="522"> between the church and the river. It occupies the site of a former house, called Vine Cottage, from a luxurious vine which covered the exterior. The humble situation of the old edifice having attracted the fancy of Mr. Walsh Porter, he purchased it, raised the building by an additional storey, and otherwise considerably altered its appearance. The entrance-hall, constructed to look like huge projecting rocks, was called the robbers' cave; <num value="1">one</num> of the bed-rooms was named the lions' den; whilst the dining-room is stated to have represented, on a small scale, the ruins, of Tintern Abbey. Here Mr. Porter had the honour of receiving and entertaining, on several occasions, the Prince of Wales, afterwards George IV. Vine Cottage was at length disposed of by Mr. Porter, and became, in <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, the residence of Lady Hawarden.   It was subsequently occupied by Mr. William Holmes, M.P. ( <QUOTE>Billy Holmes</QUOTE> ), and by others. But at length the cottage was pulled down, and the house now standing was erected on its site. The new owners filled the rooms with all sorts of antiquarian objects, from an ancient gridiron to Nell Gwynne's mirror, in its curious frame of needlework; indeed, the place became like a <num value="2">second</num> <QUOTE>Strawberry Hill.</QUOTE> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.522" n="2000.14.0196"><HEAD>Nell Gwynne's House.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 Pictures of ancient worthies, wainscoting and rich tapestries, adorned the walls; painted glass, rich in heraldic devices, filled the windows; and the new name of the <QUOTE>Pryor's Bank</QUOTE> was given to the place. 
   <P>An ample account of all the treasures which the house and gardens contained, together with details of the masques and revels which took place here, are given in Mr. Croker's book from which we have already quoted, and from which we extract the following:-- <QUOTE>Though within the walls of the Pryor's Bank, or any other human habitation, all that is rich in art may be assembled, yet, without the wish to turn these objects to a beneficial purpose, they become only a load of care; but when used to exalt and refine the national taste, they confer an immortality upon the possessor, and render him a benefactor to his species; when used, also, as accessories to the cultivation of kindly sympathies and the promotion of social enjoyment they are objects of public utility.</QUOTE> The revival of old English cordiality, especially at Christmas, had been always a favourite idea with the owners of the Pryor's Bank, and in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct> they gave a grand entertainment, which included a <QUOTE>masque,</QUOTE> written <pb id="P.523" n="523">                                         <FIGURE id="Fig.523" n="2000.14.0197"><HEAD>In And About Fulham. <num value="1">1</num>.

 <pb id="P.524" n="524"> for the occasion, in which the principal character, <QUOTE>Great Frost,</QUOTE> was enacted by Theodore Hook. The words of the piece were printed and sold in the rooms, for the benefit of the Royal Literary Fund, and resulted in the addition of <measure value="3l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3">3</num></measure> <measure value="12s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="12">12</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> to the coffers of that most admirable institution. 
    <P>The record of this memorable evening in Theodore Hook's <QUOTE>Notes</QUOTE> has a Pepysian twang about it:-- <QUOTE><datestruct VALUE="1839-12-30"><day reg="30">30</day> <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>.

So, back; wrote a little, then to dinner, afterwards to dress; so to Pryor's Bank, there much people-Sir George and Lady Whitmore, Mrs. Stopford, Mrs. Nugent, the Bulls, and various others, to the amount of <num value="150">150</num>.  I acted the  <Q>Great Frost</Q>  with considerable effect.  Jerdan, Planche, Nichols, Holmes and wife, Lane,  Crofton Croker, Giffard, Barrow.. The Whitmore family sang beautifully; all went off well.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The charms of the Pryor's Bank have been sung in verse, in the <QUOTE>Last New Ballad on the Fulham Regatta</QUOTE> --a <hi rend=italics>jeu-d'espril</hi> circulated at an entertainment given here in <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>--of which the following lines (some of them not very excellent as rhymes) will serve as a specimen:-- 
             <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Strawberry Hill has pass'd away, 
               <L>Every house must have its day; 
               <L>So in antiquarian rank

               <L>&lsquo;Tis--I hate to be perfidious-- 
               <L>&lsquo;Tis a house most sacrilegious.</QUOTE>
Like those of its prototype, Strawberry Hill, the contents of the Pryor's Bank have long since been dispersed under the hammer of the auctioneer. The <num value="1">first</num> sale took place in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, and lasted <num value="6">six</num> days; the remainder was sold off in <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>Between the Pryor's Bank and the approach to the bridge stood till <datestruct value="1871"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>, when it was destroyed by fire, a picturesque old waterside tavern, the <QUOTE>Swan.</QUOTE> It had a garden attached, looking on to the river.   The house is supposed to have been built in the reign of William III., and it is said to have been scarcely altered in any of its features since Chatelaine published his views of <QUOTE>The most Agreeable Prospects near London,</QUOTE> about <datestruct value="1740--"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>. In the elaborate ironwork which supported the sign was wrought the date <datestruct value="1698"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>. The house, with its tea-gardens, was the favourite resort of boating people, and   is   made   mention   of in Captain Marryat's <QUOTE>Jacob Faithful.</QUOTE> Amongst a few old coins, found in clearing away the ruins after the fire above mentioned, was a shilling of the time of William III., dated <datestruct value="1696--"><year reg="1696">1696</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>Passing to the east side of Bridge Street we find several old houses, which have the appearance of having once <QUOTE>seen better days;</QUOTE> whilst of others a recollection alone remains in the names given to the locality where they once stood. Stourton House, afterwards called Fulham House, close by the foot of the bridge, is said to have been a residence of the Lords Stourton <num value="3">three</num> centuries ago. Next is Ranelagh House, the grounds of which are prettily laid out, and extend from Hurlingham Lane down to the river-side.   This house, in the last century, belonged to Sir Philip Stephens, <num value="1">one</num> of the Lords of the Admiralty, whose only daughter was the wife of Lord Ranelagh, to whom   the property was bequeathed.   The next mansion eastward is Mulgrave House, formerly the seat. of. the Earl of Mulgrave, and afterwards of Colonel Torrens and Lord Ranelagh. The Earl of Egremont, the Countess of Lonsdale, and other distinguished persons, formerly had residences hereabouts, but these have been for the most part swept away, or converted to other uses. 
   <P><LEMMA id="lemma.524.1">Hurlingham House</LEMMA>, the grounds of which on the south side are bounded by the river, is altogether unnoticed by Faulkner in his <QUOTE>History of Fulham,</QUOTE> although Hurlingham Field is frequently mentioned in old documents; and it has been considered as most probable that the name arose from the field having been used for the ancient sport of hurling. The spot gained an unenviable notoriety at <num value="1">one</num> time as the site of the pest-house and burial-pit, in the time of the Great Plague of London.   The pest-house was pulled down in <datestruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></datestruct>, and the materials were sold. Hurlingham was for many years the residence of Mr. J. Horseley Palmer, Governor of the Bank of England; it is now best known by its grounds, which are much patronised by the lovers of pigeon-shooting and other aristocratic pastimes of a similar character. 
   <P>Broom House was for some time the residence of Sir John Shelley, of Maresfield Park, Sussex, who died here in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, and afterwards of the Right Hon. L. Sulivan, the brother-in-law of Lord Palmerston.   The name   of the property   appears to be of some antiquity.   Bowack mentions, in his time, the commencement of the last century, a collection of cottages by the river-side, called Broom Houses, and says, <QUOTE>The name rose from the quantity of broom that used to grow there.</QUOTE> Eastward of Broomhouse Lane, as far as Sandy End Lane, on the eastern side of the parish, the land bordering the Thames is occupied chiefly as market gardens. 
    <P>At Sandy End, near a little brook which once divided Chelsea from   Fulham, not far from the <pb id="P.525" n="525"> <QUOTE>World's End,</QUOTE> <NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="87">87</num>.</NOTE> was Sandford Manor House, once the residence of Nell Gwynne, of which a sketch may be seen in Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Hall's <QUOTE>Pilgrimages to English Shrines.</QUOTE> It now forms part of the buildings included in the premises of the Imperial Gas Company.   Its gables have been removed, and the exterior modernised; but there still remains the old staircase, up and down which fair Mistress Nell Gwynne's feet must often have paced. 
    <P>We catch another glimpse of Joseph Addison in this once remote neighbourhood. Faulkner, in his <QUOTE>History of Fulham,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, describes, at the eastern extremity of the parish, situated on a small creek running to, or rather up from, the  Thames, a building known as Sandford Manor  House, formerly of some note as having been at <num value="1">one</num> time the residence of the notorious <QUOTE>Nell  Gwynne.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The mansion,</QUOTE> he then writes, <QUOTE>is of venerable appearance: immediately in front of it are <num value="4">four</num> walnut-trees, affording an agreeable shade, that are said to have been planted by royal hands; the fruit of them is esteemed of a peculiarly fine quality.</QUOTE> But this was probably a little bit of that imagination which soon turns royal <QUOTE>geese</QUOTE> into <QUOTE>swans.</QUOTE> 
    <P><num value="2">Two</num> letters of Joseph Addison, written from Sandford Manor House in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, are interesting memorials of the state of this neighbourhood in the reign of Queen Anne, and also of the intense relish for rural scenes and pleasures which marked a man who was the author of many of the best papers in the <title>Spectator</title>, and also an UnderSecre- tary of State. They are addressed to the young Lord Warwick, to whom   he afterwards became stepfather.   In the <num value="1">first</num> he gives a particular account of a curious bird's-nest found near the house, about which his neighbours were divided in opinion, some taking it for a skylark's, some for that of a canary, whilst he himself judged its inmates to be tomtits.   In the <num value="2">second</num> letter he writes: <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>I can't forbear being troublesome to your lordship while I am in your neighbourhood. The business of this, to invite you to a concert of music which I have found in a tree in a neighbouring wood. It begins precisely at <num value="6">six</num> in the evening, and consists of a blackbird, a thrush, a robinredbreast, and a bullfinch. There is a lark that, by way of overture, sings and mounts till she is almost out of hearing, and afterwards falls down leisurely and drops to the ground, as soon as she has ended her song. The whole is concluded by a nightingale that has a much better yoice than  Mrs. Tofts, and something of Italian manners in its diversions. If your lordship will honour me with your company, I will promise to entertain you with much better music and more agreeable scenes than you ever met with at the opera, and will conclude with a charming description of a nightingale, out of our friend Virgil:-- 
 <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>So close in poplar shades, her children gone, 
      <L>The mother nightingale laments alone, 
      <L>Whose nest some prying churl had found, and thence 
      <L>By stealth conveyed the unfeathered innocents; 
      <L>But she supplies the night with mournful strains, 
      <L>And melancholy music fills the plains.</QUOTE></QUOTE>

    <P>This letter places before us a picture of the elegant essayist on a bright May evening, with upturned ear, beneath some lofty elm   or oak, charmed with the beautiful oratorio of the birds in the woods about Fulham--an oratorio now, it is to be feared, no longer heard. 
    <P>The south-eastern side of the parish, between  Fulham Road and the river, including the works of the Imperial Gas Company, was formed, in <datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>, into a new ecclesiastical district, called St. James's,  Moore Park.   The church, a large cruciform structure of Early-English architecture, was built from the designs of Mr. Darbishire. 
    <P>Walham Green is-or, rather, was--a triangular plot of greensward on the north side of the Fulham Road, upon which, in former times, donkeys had been wont to graze, and the village children to play at cricket. 
   <P>The derivation of the name of Walham Green is somewhat obscure and doubtful.   Lysons and Faulkner say it is properly Wendon, the manor of Wendon being mentioned in a deed of conveyance, in <datestruct value="1449--"><year reg="1449">1449</year></datestruct>; but it is also called, in various old documents, by the name of Wandon, Wansdon, Wansdown, and Wandham.   It seems to have been <num value="1">first</num> called by its present name about the end of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. The green, as such, has long since disappeared, and some national schools now occupy its site. In <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct> St. John's Church was erected, as a chapel of ease to Fulham. The edifice covers the spot which was formerly the <QUOTE>village pond,</QUOTE> but which was filled up when the spread of building in this direction rendered such a proceeding necessary. The church is a brick building, of common-place Gothic design, with a tall tower, adorned with pinnacles. 
   <P>There were at <num value="1">one</num> time a few noteworthy old houses at Walham Green, but of these scarcely a vestige now   remains; and within the last halfcentury the place may be said to have assumed altogether a new aspect, more especially since the erection of the Butchers' Almshouses, the <num value="1">first</num> <pb id="P.526" n="526"> stone of which was laid by Lord Ravensworth, in <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>.   Since that time, as Mr. Croker informs us, <QUOTE>fancy fairs and bazaars, with horticultural exhibitions, have been fashionably patronised at Walham   Green by omnibus companies, for the support and enlargement of this institution.</QUOTE> The almshouses are a neat cluster of buildings, occupying <num value="3">three</num> sides of a square, opening upon Farm Place, close beside St. John's Church. 
   <P>In the <hi rend=italics>London Magazine</hi> for <datestruct VALUE="1749-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>, Mr. Bartholomew Roque thus apostrophises, in rhyme, if not in poetry, this once rural spot:-- 
     <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Hail, happy isle! and happier Walham Green! 
        <L>Where all that's fair and beautiful are seen! 
        <L>Where wanton zephyrs court the ambient air, 
        <L>And sweets ambrosial banish every care; 
        <L>Where thought nor trouble social joy molest, 
        <L>Nor vain solicitude can banish rest, 
        <L>Peaceful and happy here I reign serene, 
        <L>Perplexity defy, and smile at spleen. 
        <L>Belles, beaux, and statesmen all around me shine- 
        <L>All own me their supreme, me constitute divine; 
        <L>All wait my pleasure, own my awful nod, 
        <L>And change the humble gard'ner to the god.</QUOTE>

   <P>Mr. B. Roque, it need scarcely be added, was a well-known florist in his day; and the <QUOTE>belles, beaux, and statesmen</QUOTE> by whom   he speaks of being surrounded were nothing more nor less than new varieties of flowers dignified by distinguished names.   He was brother of Mr. Roque, the surveyor, to whose <QUOTE>Map of London and its Environs, in <datestruct value="1748--"><year reg="1748">1748</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> we have several times had occasion to refer in the progress of this work. 
   <P>The <QUOTE>Swan</QUOTE> Brewery and Tavern at Walham Green have been established upwards of a century. 
   <P>North End, a hamlet of Fulham, lying between Walham   Green and Hammersmith Road, is described in the <QUOTE>Ambulator</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>) as <QUOTE>a pleasant village near Hammersmith, where are the handsome   house   and   finely-disposed gardens lately possessed by the Earl of Tilney, and of the late Sir John Stanley.</QUOTE> Mrs. Delaney, in <num value="1">one</num> of her letters to Dr. Swift, in <datestruct value="1736--"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct>, writes: <QUOTE>My employment this summer has been making a grotto at North End for my grandfather, Sir John Stanley.</QUOTE> The mansion, called Browne's House, was at the commencement of the last century the seat of Lord Griffin, but in <datestruct value="1718--"><year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct> became the property of Sir J. Stanley. It was afterwards owned by Francis Earl Brooke, who sold it to the Duke of Devonshire, by whom it was sold, in <datestruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>, to Sir Gilbert Heathcote.   It was pulled down about the year <datestruct value="1800"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>, and its site turned into a brickfield. 
   <P>At North End Lodge, close by Walham Green, lived for some time Mr. Albert Smith, the popular lecturer and writer, and here he died, in <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>Jacob Tonson, the celebrated   bookseller, of whom we have already spoken in our account of the Strand,<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="79">79</num>.</NOTE> had a house at North End for many years, before removing to Barn Elms, just above Putney; and Mrs. Nisbet (afterwards Lady Boothby) was likewise at <num value="1">one</num> time a resident here. 
   <P>North End Road, by which we now proceed on our way to Hammersmith, is almost <num value="1">one</num> continuous line of ordinary cottages and middle-class shops, which are rapidly extending on the left-hand side over Fulham   Fields.   In Faulkner's time, at the commencement of this century, it was a country road, winding between market gardens, but contained a few good houses, which had been <QUOTE>successively occupied by several eminent and remarkable characters.</QUOTE> These, however, have now   for the most part disappeared. 
   <P>On the east side of the road, at a short distance from Walham Green, stands Beaufort House, now used as the head-quarters of the South Middlesex Volunteer Corps, and the meeting-place for the sports and races of the London Athletic Ciub; and between this and West London and Westminster Cemetery, from which it is separated by the West London Junction Railway, is Lillie Bridge Runningground, a place familiar to the lovers of cricket, pedestrian matches, bicycle races, &amp;c. 
    <P>Foote, the dramatist and comedian, resided for many years at North End, where he had a favourite villa.   The place when he took it was advertised to be completely furnished, but he had not been there long before the cook complained that there was not a rolling-pin. <QUOTE>No!</QUOTE> said he; <QUOTE>then bring me a saw, I will soon make <num value="1">one</num>;</QUOTE> which he accordingly did, of <num value="1">one</num> of the mahogany bed-posts. The next day it was discovered that a coal-scuttle was wanted, when he supplied this deficiency with a drawer from a curious japan chest.   A carpet being wanted in the parlour, he ordered a new white cotton counterpane to be laid, to save the boards.   His landlord   paying him   a visit, to inquire how he liked his new residence, was greatly astonished to find such disorder, as he considered it. He remonstrated with Foote, and complained of the injury his furniture had sustained; but Foote insisted upon it all the complaint was on his side, considering the trouble he had been at to supply these necessaries, notwithstanding he had advertised his house completely furnished. The landlord now threatened the law, upon which Foote threatened to take him off, saying an auctioneer was a fruitful character. This last consideration weighed with the landlord, and he quietly put up with his loss. <pb id="P.527" n="527"> The house, upon the improvement of which Foote spent large sums of money, was for many years called The Hermitage, and is now known as Mount Carmel Retreat. It stands in North End Road, at the corner of Lillie Road, and is surrounded by a large garden enclosed by high walls. 
   <P>Exactly opposite to this house, at the angle of the road, stood till recently an old dwelling-house called Cambridge Lodge, which was once the abode of Francesco Bartolozzi, the celebrated Florentine artist, who arrived in England in <datestruct value="1764--"><year reg="1764">1764</year></datestruct>, and came to reside here in <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct>.   He was the father of Madame Vestris, the well-known comedian, singer, and theatrical manageress. 
   <P>A little to the west of North End Road, almost surrounded by market gardens, stands Normand House, a large, rambling, old-fashioned brick building, profusely overgrown with ivy. Over the principal gateway is the date, <datestruct value="1664"><year reg="1664">1664</year></datestruct>, and the building is said to have been used as an hospital during the Great Plague in the following year. In <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, according to Faulkner, the local historian, <QUOTE>it was appropriated for the reception of insane ladies.</QUOTE> Mr. Croker, in his <QUOTE>Walk from London to Fulham,</QUOTE> says that Sir E. Lytton Bulwer at <num value="1">one</num> time resided here. The house is now once more used as a lunatic asylum for ladies. 
   <P>Close by is a small house called Wentworth Cottage, once occupied by Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Hall. In the garden in front of the house grows a willow planted by them from a slip of that which overshadowed the grave of Napoleon at St. Helena. 
   <P>The open ground hereabouts, known as Fulham Fields, but which is being rapidly encroached upon by the hands of the builder, was formerly called <QUOTE>No Man's Land.</QUOTE> Faulkner says that it contained in his time (<datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>) <QUOTE>about <num value="6">six</num> houses.</QUOTE> <num value="1">One</num> of these was <QUOTE>an ancient house, once the residence of the family of Plumbe,</QUOTE> the site of which is now covered by a cluster of dwellings which were erected for the labourers in the surrounding market gardens, that reach from Walham Green nearly to the Thames, the North End Road forming the eastern boundary of Fulham Fields. 
   <P>Retracing our steps to North End Road, we will resume our walk northwards. Immediately beyond Bartolozzi's house, enclosed by an old wall supposed to date from the time of Charles II., stood a tall house, once the residence of Cheeseman, the engraver, a pupil of Bartolozzi. Farther on, on the opposite side of the way, also stood till <datestruct value="1846"><year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct>, when it was pulled down, Walnut-tree Cottage, which was at <num value="1">one</num> time the residence of Edmund Kean, the actor, and also of Copley, the artist, the father of Lord Lyndhurst. Cipriani, the painter, once had a house close by this spot, but it has long since shared the fate of its more aristocratic neighbours, and been removed, to give place to modern bricks and mortar. 
   <P>A large stucco-fronted house on the right, close by the railway station, was built many years ago by Mr. Slater, as a family residence, but has since been converted to other purposes. About the year <datestruct value="1875"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct> the mansion was taken by the benevolent Society of St. John of Jerusalem, by whom it was fitted up, with the intention of using it as a convalescent hospital; but circumstances arose which caused the idea to be abandoned.   The house was, however, subsequently secured by a religious sisterhood, by whom   it has been used for the above-mentioned   purpose, and   known   as St. Saviour's Convalescent Hospital. 
   <P>The house once inhabited by Dr. Crotch, the distinguished musician, which was situated a short distance farther up the road, has been levelled with the ground, and a row of humble dwellings, called Grove Cottages, erected in its place. Dr. Crotch's house is said to have been previously the residence of Ryland, the engraver, who was executed for forgery in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>Nearly opposite Grove Cottages is a large house --now cut up into <num value="2">two</num>, <num value="1">one</num> being stucco-fronted, and ornamented with a veranda, and the other faced with red brick--which was for many years the residence of Samuel Richardson, the author of <QUOTE>Clarissa Harlowe,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Sir Charles Grandison,</QUOTE> &amp;c. Here he entertained large literary parties, including such men as Johnson, Boswell, &amp;c. In the gardens attached to the house are some fine cedars. Most of Richardson's works were written whilst he was living here. Mrs. Barbauld, in her <QUOTE>Life</QUOTE> of the novelist, prefixed to his <QUOTE>Correspondence,</QUOTE> tells us how that he <QUOTE>used to write in a little summer-house or grotto, within his garden, at North End, before the family were up, and when they met at breakfast he communicated the progress of his story.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Richardson's villa, of which a view is given in his <QUOTE>Correspondence,</QUOTE> is described by Faulkner as being situated near the Hammersmith turnpike. The precise locality of the house, however, seems to have been unknown to some at least of the inhabitants at the commencement of this century, for Sir Richard Phillips used to relate with glee the following anecdote respecting his inquiries in the neighbourhood:-- <QUOTE>A widow kept a public-house near the corner of North End Lane, about <num value="2">two</num> miles from Hyde Park Corner, where she had lived about <num value="50">fifty</num> years; and I wanted to determine the house in which Samuel Richardson, the novelist, had <pb id="P.528" n="528"> resided in North End Lane.   She remembered his person, and described him   as  <Q>a round, short gentleman, who most days passed her door,</Q>  and she said she used to serve his family with beer.  <Q>He used to live and carry on his business,</Q>  said I,  <Q>in Salisbury Square.</Q>   <Q>As to that,</Q>  said she,  <Q>I know nothing, for I never was in London.</Q>   <Q>Never in London!</Q>  said I,  <Q>and in health, with the free use of your limbs!</Q>   <Q>No,</Q>  replied the woman;  <Q>I had no business there, and had enough to do at home.</Q>   <Q>Well, then,</Q>  I observed,  <Q>you know your own neighbourhood the better--which was the house of Mr. Richardson, in the next lane?</Q>   <Q> I don't know,</Q>  she replied;  <Q> I am, as I told you, no traveller. <hi rend=italics>I never was up the lane-I</hi> only know that he did live somewhere up the lane.</Q>   <Q>Well,</Q>  said I,  <Q>but living in Fulham, you go to church?</Q>   <Q>No,</Q>  said she, <Q> I never have time; on a Sunday our house is always full--I never was at Fulham but once, and that was when I was married, and many people say that was once too often, though thy husband was as good a man as ever broke bread-God rest his soul!</Q> </QUOTE> <foreign lang=la>Sic transit gloria.</foreign>

   <P>Among the <QUOTE>notabilities</QUOTE> either resident in or connected with Fulham, of whom we have not 
<FIGURE id="Fig.528" n="2000.14.0198"><HEAD>Ranelagh House.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 already spoken, may be mentioned Burbage, the actor, who at <num value="1">one</num> time had a house at North End; Norden, the topographer, who dated the preface of his projected <QUOTE>Speculum   Britannia</QUOTE> from his <QUOTE>poore house neere Fulham;</QUOTE> John Florio, a scholar of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, and tutor to Prince Henry, son of James I.; and George Cartwright, the author of a long-forgotten play called <QUOTE>Heroic Love, or the Infanta of Spain: a Tragedy, <datestruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Another resident was John Dunning, Lord Ashburton, who having struggled in early life against a narrow   income, left behind   him   a fortune of <measure value="150000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="150000">150,000</num></measure>, though he died at <num value="52">fifty-two</num>.

<NOTE RESP=BOLLES><LEMMA id="lemma.529.1">Hammersmith from Chiswick</LEMMA></NOTE>
 
<P>The town of Hammersmith, at the entrance of which we now find ourselves, is a large straggling place, with a population of nearly <num value="45000">45,000</num> souls. It lies principally on the high road, which, before the introduction of railways, was the main thoroughfare from London to the West of England. Down to the year <datestruct value="1834"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct> it was known parochially as the Hammersmith division, or side, of the parish of Fulham; but since that period it has not only been made a separate parish, but it has also become in <pb id="P.530" n="530"> its turn the parent of <num value="4">four</num> separate ecclesiastical districts. During the Interregnum, it was proposed to make the hamlet parochial, and to add to it Sir Nicholas Crispe's house, between Fulham   Road and the river, of which we shall presently speak, and a part of North End, <QUOTE>extending from the common highway to London unto the end   of Gibbs's Green.</QUOTE> The parish now extends from Kensington on the east, along the high road to Turnham   Green, and by the side of the Thames from the Crab Tree to Chiswick; and it includes the hamlets of Brook Green, Pallenswick, or Stanbrook Green, and Shepherd's Bush.   Faulkner, in his <QUOTE>History of Fulham</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>), in speaking of the separation of Hammersmith from Fulham, and its erection into an ecclesiastical district, remarks, <QUOTE>When the inhabitants of Fulham   and the inhabitants of Hammersmith did mutually agree to divide the parish, it was also agreed that a ditch should be dug as a boundary between them, it being the custom   of those days to divide districts in this manner, whereupon a ditch was dug for the above purposes. This watercourse,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>begins a little to the west of the elegant seat of the late Bubb Dodington, Esq. [Brandenburgh House]; there it is formed into canals, fish-ponds, &amp;c.; out of his garden it crosseth the road from Fulham   Field   to Hammersmith, and   so in a meandering course bearing westerly and northerly, it crosseth the London Road opposite the road leading to Brook Green, and from thence, on the north side of the London Road, it runs easterly, and falls into Chelsea Creek, at Counter's Bridge.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The town of Hammersmith consists of several streets, the principal of which is King Street, which formed part of the road to Windsor, about a mile and a half long; at the eastern end this street widens into the Broadway, where it is crossed by a road from Brook Green and the Uxbridge Road, which is continued over the Suspension Bridge into Surrey. The main streets are lined throughout with numerous shops, while the busy posting-houses of former times have given way to <num value="4">four</num> large railway stations--the London and South-Western, in the Grove; the North London, in the Brentford Road; and the Metropolitan and the Metropolitan District in the Broadway. Altogether, therefore, the place now wears a modern business-like aspect, in spite of a number of old red-brick mansions. At the commencement of the present century, as we learn from Faulkner, the village had several good houses in and about it, and was <QUOTE>inhabited by gentry and persons of quality.</QUOTE> Now these old mansions are for the most part pulled down, converted into public institutions or schools, cut up into smaller tenements, or made to give place to large and busy factories.   Here and there a picturesque old tavern may still be seen, recalling to mind the times when stage-coaches travelled along the Hammersmith Road, on their way to the West of England; <num value="1">one</num> such, in the neighbourhood of North End Road, is the <QUOTE>Bell and Anchor,</QUOTE> an inn much patronised by people of fashion in the early part of the reign of George III., though now frequented only by the working population about North End. Mr. Larwood tells us, in his <QUOTE>History of Sign-boards,</QUOTE> that representations of the place and of its visitors may be seen in caricatures of the period published by Bowles and Carver, of St. Paul's Churchyard.   Another publichouse, farther along the road, bearing the sign of the <QUOTE>Red   Cow,</QUOTE> still bears upon its exterior clear evidence of its antiquity: it is said to- have stood here for about a couple of centuries. 
   <P>If there is <num value="1">one</num> spot in the neighbourhood of London to which the English Roman Catholics look with greater veneration than another, just as the Nonconformist looks to Bunhill Fields Cemetery, that spot is Hammersmith, which contains an unusual number of establishments belonging to the members of that faith. 
   <P>On the south side of the high road, just before entering the town, and close to the busy thoroughfare of King Street East, stands a tall Gothic building, of secluded and religious appearance, <num value="3">three</num> storeys high, the home of those noble-hearted ladies, of whose self-denial any communion in the world might well be proud--the <QUOTE>Little Sisters of the Poor.</QUOTE> We will not attempt to describe it in our own words, but will employ those of the biographer of Thomas Walker, the London police magistrate, and   author of <QUOTE>The Original</QUOTE> --a gentleman whose Protestant zeal is beyond suspicion.   He writes: <QUOTE>We are under the roof of the Little Sisters of the Poor. The house is full of old folk, men and women. It is Death's vestibule governed by the gentlest charity I have ever seen acting on the broken fortunes of mankind.   The sisters are so many gentlewomen who have put aside all those worldly vanities so dear in these days of hoops and paint to the majority of their sisters, and have dedicated their lives to the menial service of destitute old age.   They beg crusts and bones from   door to door, and spread the daily board for their <hi rend=italics>proteges</hi> with the crumbs from the rich men's tables.   And it is only after the old men and women have feasted on the best of the crumbs that the noble sisters break their fast.   I stepped into the Little Sisters' refectory. The dishes were heaps of hard crusts and scraps of cheese; and at <pb id="P.531" n="531"> the ends of the table were jugs of water. The table was as clean as that of the primmest epicure. The <hi rend=italics>serviette</hi> of each sister was folded within a ring. And the sisters sit daily--are sitting to-day, will sit to-morrow--with perfect cheerfulness, their banquet the crumbs from pauper tables! Cheerfulness will digest the hardest crust, the horniest cheese, or these pious women had died long ago. He who may find it difficult to make the <num value="1">first</num> step to the cleanly, healthy, gentlemanly life into which Thomas Walker schooled himself, should knock at the gate of the hermitage wherein the Little Sisters of the Poor banquet pauper age, and pass into the refectory of these gentlewomen.   It is but a stone's-throw out of the noisy world. It lies in the midst of London. Here let the half-repentant, the wavering Sybarite rest awhile, pondering the help which a holy cheerfulness gives to the stomach --yea, when the food is an iron crust and cheeseparings.</QUOTE> The edifice, called Nazareth House, or the <QUOTE>Convent of the Little Daughters of Nazareth,</QUOTE> is shut in from the roadway by a brick wall, and the grounds attached to it extend back a considerable distance. It provides a home not only for aged, destitute, and infirm poor persons, but likewise an hospital for epileptic children. 
    <P>On the opposite side of the high road, and within a few yards from Nazareth House, is a group of Roman Catholic institutions, the chief of which is the old Benedictine convent, now used as a training college for the priesthood.   The site of this college has been devoted to the purposes of Roman Catholic education from the days of King Henry VIII., for it was a school for young ladies for more than <num value="3">three</num> centuries down to the year <datestruct value="1869"><year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct>, when the building was <num value="1">first</num> used as a training college.   But the tradition is that it existed as a convent some time before the Reformation; and that subsequently to that date, though ostensibly it was only a girls' school, in reality it was carried on by professed religious ladies, who were nuns in disguise, and who said their office and recited their litanies and rosaries in secret, whilst wearing the outward appearance of ordinary Englishwomen. Faulkner, in his <QUOTE>Historyof Hammersmith,</QUOTE> mentions this tradition, and adds that it is supposed <QUOTE>to have escaped the general destruction of religious houses on account of its want of endowment.</QUOTE> If this really was the case, then poverty is sometimes even to be preferred to wealth. 
   <P>On the breaking--up of the religious houses in England most of the sisterhoods retired to the Continent, where they kept up the practice of their vows unbroken; and we find that a body of Benedictine sisters settled at Dunkirk in <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, under their abbess, Dame Mary Caryl, whom they regarded as the founder of their house, and who was previously a nun at Ghent.   Another Benedictine house, largely recruited from the ladies of the upper classes in England--a colony from the same city--was settled about the same time at Boulogne, and soon after removed to Pontoise, in the neighbourhood of Paris. 
    <P>As the English Reformation, <num value="2">two</num> centuries and a half before, had driven this Ghent sisterhood from England, so in <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct> the outbreak of the <num value="1">first</num>  French Revolution wafted its members back again --not, however, by a very tranquil passage--to the shores which their great-great-grandparents had been forced to leave.   Already, however, something had been done to prepare the way for their return. Catherine of Braganza, the poor neglected queen of Charles II., invited over to England some members of a sisterhood at Munich, called the  Institute of the Blessed Virgin, and these she settled and supported during her husband's life in a house in St. Martin's Lane.   On the death of the king, finding their tenure so near to the Court to be rather insecure, these ladies were glad to migrate farther afield. The chance was soon given to them. A certain Mrs. Frances Bedingfeld, a sister, we believe, of the <num value="1">first</num> baronet of that family, procured, by the aid of the queen, the possession of a large house-indeed, the largest house at that time--in Hammersmith, to the north of the road, near the Broadway, and with a spacious garden behind it. This house adjoined the ladies' school which we have already mentioned; and in course of time the <hi rend=italics>sub rosa</hi> convent and the sisterhood from St. Martin's Lane were merged into <num value="1">one</num> institution under an abbess, who followed the Benedictine rule.   The Lady Frances Bedingfeld, as foundress, became the <num value="1">first</num> abbess; and she was succeeded by Mrs. Cecilia Cornwallis, who was a kinswoman of Queen Anne. The school, though somewhat foreign to the scope of a contemplative order, was now   carried   on more openly and avowedly, though still in modest retirement, by the Benedictine sisterhood, who, adding a <num value="3">third</num> messuage to their <num value="2">two</num> houses, at once taught the daughters of the Roman Catholic aristocracy, and established a home in which ladies in their widowhood might take up their residence <hi rend=italics>en pension</hi>, with the privilege of hearing mass and receiving the sacraments in the little chapel attached to it. 
 <P>Thus the school became absorbed in the convent <num value="2">two</num> centuries ago. In the year <datestruct value="1680"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct> the infamous  Titus Oates obtained from the authorities a commission to search the house, as being a reputed nunnery, as well as a well-known home of Papists <pb id="P.532" n="532"> and recusants.   It is not a little singular that, although there was no cheap daily press in his day, we have <num value="2">two</num> separate and independent reports of this proceeding which have come down to us. The <num value="1">first</num> is to be found in the <hi rend=italics>Domestic Intelligencer,</hi>
or <hi rend=italics>News both from   City and Country</hi>, for <datestruct VALUE="1679-01-13"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=13>13th</day>, <year reg=1679>1679</year></datestruct>-<num value="80">80</num>.   The other report, more briefly and tersely expressed, appears in the <hi rend=italics>True Domestic Intelligencer</hi> of the same date. 
   <P>Exactly a century passed away, so far as any records or traditions have been preserved, before the   Benedictine sisters again   experienced   any alarm; but in <datestruct VALUE="1780-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, the convent was doomed to destruction by the infuriated mob. The only precaution which the nuns appear to have taken was to pack up the sacramental plate in a chest, which the lady abbess intrusted to a faithful friend and neighbour, a Mr. Gomme, and who kindly buried it in his garden till the danger had passed away. 
   <P><num value="25">Twenty-five</num> ladies from   foreign convents on their arrival in England came to Hammersmith, and made it their temporary home until they could obtain admission into other religious houses. In fact, on their arrival they found only <num value="3">three</num> aged nuns, including the abbess, who rejoiced at being able to give them the shelter which they so much needed.   The school was accordingly carried on by the Abbess of Pontoise (Dame Prujean), who here revived the school which had dwindled away; and for many years it was the only Catholic ladies' school near the metropolis.   Faulkner gives no list of abbesses who ruled this convent during the <num value="2">two</num> centuries of its existence at Hammersmith. We are able, however, to give it complete from a private source, a MS. in the possession of Mrs. Jervis, a near relative of the Markhams, who, at various times, were <QUOTE>professed</QUOTE> within its walls. The list runs as follows:--Frances Bedingfeld (<datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>), Cicely Cornwallis (<datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>), Frances Bernard (<datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct>), Mary Delison (<datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>), Frances Gentil (<datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>), Marcella Dillon (<datestruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct>), Mary Placida Messenger (<datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>), and Placida Selby (<datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct>).   The convent at Hammersmith, composed as it was of <num value="3">three</num> private houses, and built in such a way as to do anything rather than attract the attention of the public eye, presented anything but an attractive appearance.   A   high wall screened it from   the passers-by, and the southern face was simply a plain brick front, pierced with <num value="2">two</num> rows of plain sash windows. Inside, the rooms used as dormitories and class-rooms had the same heavy and dreary look, as if the place were a cross between a badly-endowed parsonage and a workhouse school. 
    <P>The chapel, which was built in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct> by Mr.  George Gillow, and served for many years--in fact, down to <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>-as the mission chapel of Hammersmith   and   the neighbourhood, still stands, the lower end of it having been cut off and made into a library for the use of the theological students who have been located in these buildings since they were vacated in <datestruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct> by the sisterhood.  At the south-eastern corner, between the house and the road, stood a porter's lodge and the guestrooms; but these have been pulled down.   Here, too, it is said, stood the original chapel.   The principal of the training college, Bishop Wethers, coadjutor to Cardinal Manning, resides in   the western   portion of the   building, formerly the residence of the Portuguese minister, the Baron  Moncorvo. 
    <P>In the middle of the eighteenth century the  Vicar-Apostolic of the London District--as the chief Roman Catholic Bishop in England was then called-had his home at Hammersmith, from which place several of the pastoral letters of those prelates were dated. 
    <P>Here-probably in apartments attached to the convent-died, in <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>, in his ninetieth year, Dr.  Bonaventura Giffard, chaplain to King James II., and nominated by that king to the headship of  Magdalen College, Oxford, though divested of his office at the Revolution.   He became afterwards <num value="1">one</num> of the Roman Catholic bishops <hi rend=italics>in partibus,</hi>
and lived a life of apostolical poverty, simplicity, and charity.   On his deposition from   Magdalen  College, Dr. Giffard was arrested and imprisoned in Newgate, simply for the exercise of his spiritual functions. Being a man of peace, he lived privately, with the connivance of the Government of the time, in London and at Hammersmith, where he was regarded as almost a saint on account of his charity.  He attended the Earl of Derwentwater before his execution at the Tower in <datestruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>Here Dr. Challoner, the ablest Roman Catholic controversialist of the eighteenth century, was consecrated, in <datestruct VALUE="1741-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct>, a bishop of his church and Vicar-Apostolic of the London District, with the title of Bishop of Debra <hi rend=italics>in partibus infidelium.</hi>
 Cardinal Weld was for <num value="3">three</num> years director of the  Benedictine nuns of this convent. 
    <P> <QUOTE>A nunnery,</QUOTE> writes Priscilla Wakefield in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>is not a common object in England; but there is at Hammersmith <num value="1">one</num> which is said to have taken its rise from   a boarding-school established in the reign of Charles II., for young ladies of the  Catholic Church. The zeal of the governesses and teachers,</QUOTE> she adds, <QUOTE>induced them voluntarily to subject themselves to monastic ruleS, a system that has been preserved by many devotees, who have <pb id="P.533" n="533"> taken the veil and secluded themselves from the world.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In King Street East stands the West London Hospital, an institution which has been increasing in importance and usefulness yearly since it was <num value="1">first</num> established. As this charity is unendowed, it is dependent entirely on voluntary contributions for its support. 
   <P>Stow   mentions a Lock hospital<NOTE>See Vol. V., pp. <num value="14">14</num>, <num value="215">215</num>, and <num value="528">528</num>.</NOTE>   as formerly standing at Hammersmith; but no traces of its whereabouts are now   visible; and as the local historian, Faulkner, is altogether silent on the subject, it is possible that the honest annalist was for once at fault. 
   <P>The Broadway forms the central part of the town, whence roads diverge to the right and left; that to the right leads to Brook Green, whilst that on the left hand leads to the Suspension Bridge across the Thames.   On the north side of the Broadway, up a narrow court, is a large house surrounding a quadrangle. It used to be a sort of seraglio for George IV., when Prince of Wales; but it has long been cut up into tenements for poor people. 
  <P>Brook Green-so called from a small tributary of the Thames which once wound its way through it from   north-west to   south-east-connects the Broadway, on the north side, with Shepherd's Bush, which lies west of Notting Hill, on the Uxbridge Road. It is a long narrow strip of common land, bordered with elms and chestnuts, and can still boast of a few good houses.   In former times a fair was held here annually in May, lasting <num value="3">three</num> days. At the eastern end of the green is a group of Roman Catholic buildings, the chief of which is the Church of the Holy Trinity. This is a spacious stone edifice of the Early Decorated style of architecture, and has a lofty tower and spire at the northeastern corner. The <num value="1">first</num> stone of the building was laid in <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>, by Cardinal Wiseman. 
    <P>The external appearance of this church derives some additional interest from its contiguity to the scarcely less beautiful almshouses of St. Joseph, the <num value="1">first</num> stone of which was laid by the Duchess of Norfolk, in <datestruct VALUE="1851-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>.   The almshouses are built in a style to correspond with the church, and form together with it a spacious quadrangle. They provide accommodation for <num value="40">forty</num> aged persons, and are managed by the committee of the Aged Poor  Society. 
    <P>On the opposite side of the road stands St.  Mary's Normal College, built from the designs of  Mr. Charles Hansom, of Clifton, in the Gothic style of architecture.   It contains a chapel, and is capable of accommodating <num value="70">seventy</num> students. Near at hand are a Roman Catholic Reformatory for boys and another for girls. The former is located in an ancient mansion, Blythe House. This house, Faulkner informs us, was reported to have been haunted; <QUOTE>many strange stories,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>were related of ghosts and apparitions having been   seen here; but it turned out at last that a gang of smugglers had taken up their residence in it, supposing that this sequestered place would be favourable to their illegal pursuits.</QUOTE> No doubt, in the last century, the situation of Blythe House was lonely and desolate enough to favour such a supposition as the above; and, apart from this, the roads about Hammersmith in the reign of George II. would seem to have been haunted by footpads and robbers. At all events, Mr. Lewins, in his <QUOTE>History of the Post Office,</QUOTE> reminds us that in <datestruct value="1757--"><year reg="1757">1757</year></datestruct>, the boy who carried the mail for Portsmouth happening to dismount at Hammersmith, about <num value="3">three</num> miles from Hyde Park Corner, and to call for beer, some thieves took the opportunity to cut the mail-bags from off the horse's crupper, and got away undiscovered. The plunder was probably all the more valuable, as there was then no <QUOTE>money-order office,</QUOTE> and even large sums of money were enclosed in letters in the shape of bank-notes. 
    <P>At that time nearly all the land in the outskirts of Hammersmith was under cultivation as nurseries or market gardens, whence a large portion of the produce for the London markets was obtained.  Bradley, in his <QUOTE>Philosophical Account of the  Works of Nature,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, tells us that <QUOTE>the gardens about Hammersmith are famous for strawberries, raspberries, currants, gooseberries, and such like; and if early fruit is our desire,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>Mr. Millet's garden at North End, near the same place, affords us cherries, apricots, and curiosities of those kinds, some months before the natural season.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Messrs. Lee's nursery garden here enjoyed great celebrity towards the close of the last century; and it is said that they were the <num value="1">first</num> who introduced the fuchsia, now so common, to the public.  Their nursery was formerly a vineyard, where large quantities of Burgundy wine were made. To store the wine a thatched house was built, and several large cellars were excavated. The rooms above were afterwards in the occupation of Worlidge, the engraver, and here he executed many of the most valuable and admired of his works. 
    <P>It was close by Lee's nursery that Samuel Taylor Coleridge stayed frequently with his friends the <pb id="P.534" n="534"> Morgans, who lived on the road between Kensington and Hammersmith. H. Crabb Robinson, in his <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> under date <datestruct VALUE="1811-07-28"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=28>28</day>,   <year reg=1811>1811</year></datestruct>, tells us how he <QUOTE>after dinner walked to Morgan's, beyond Kensington, to see Coleridge, and found Southey there.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The region northward of the main thoroughfare through Hammersmith is being rapidly covered with streets, many of the houses being of a superior class, particularly in the neighbourhood of Ravenscourt Park.   In Dartmouth Road is the church of St. John the Evangelist, a large and lofty edifice, of Early-English architecture, built in <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, from the designs of Mr. Butterfield. It was erected by voluntary contributions, at a cost of about <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure>. Close by St. John's Church is the Godolphin School, which was founded in the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century under the will of William Godolphin, but remodelled as a grammar school, in accordance with a scheme of the Court of Chancery, in <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>. The buildings of this institution are surrounded by playgrounds, about <num value="4">four</num> acres in extent; the school is built, like the adjoining church, of brick, with stone mullions and dressings, and it is in the Early Collegiate Gothic style, from the designs of Mr. C. H. Cooke. 
<FIGURE id="Fig.534" n="2000.14.0200"><HEAD>The Nunnery, Hammersmith, In <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 The buildings include a large school-room, capable of accommodating <num value="200">200</num> boys, several class-rooms, a dining-hall, dormitories for <num value="40">forty</num> boarders, and a residence for the head-master. 
   <P>Ravenscourt Park, at the north-western extremity of Hammersmith, marks the site of the ancient manor-house of Pallenswick, which is supposed to have belonged to Alice Perrers, or Pierce, a lady of not very enviable fame at the court of Edward III., upon whose banishment, in <datestruct value="1378--"><year reg="1378">1378</year></datestruct>, the place was seized by the Crown. The surveyof the manor, taken about that time, describes it as containing <QUOTE><num value="40">forty</num> acres of land, <num value="60">sixty</num> of pasture, and <num value="1">one</num> and a half of meadow.</QUOTE> The manor-house is described as <QUOTE>well built, in good repair, and containing a large hall, chapel, &amp;c.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1631--"><year reg="1631">1631</year></datestruct> the manor of Pallenswick was sold to Sir Richard Gurney, the brave and loyal Lord Mayor of London who died a prisoner in the Tower in <datestruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct>. Down to nearly the close of the last century, the manor-house was surrounded by a moat, and Faulkner describes it as <QUOTE>of the style and date of the French architect Mansard     .   .   .   Tradition,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>has assigned the site of this house as having been a hunting-seat of Edward III.   His arms, richly <pb id="P.535" n="535">

 <pb id="P.536" n="536"> carved in wood, stood, till within these few years, in a large upper room, but they fell to pieces upon being removed when the house was repaired; the crest of Edward the Black Prince, which was placed over the arms, is still preserved in a parlour, and is in good preservation.   . . . It is very probable that this piece of carving was an appendage to the ancient manor-house when it was in the possession of Alice Pierce.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Little to the north of Ravenscourt Park, and leading up towards Shepherd's Bush, on the Uxbridge Road, lies Starch Green, which-like Stanford Brook Green and Gaggle-Goose Green, in the same neighbourhood, mentioned by Faulkner as <QUOTE><num value="2">two</num> small rural villages</QUOTE> --is now being rapidly covered with houses, and is <num value="1">one</num> of those places which is fortunate enough not to have a history. 
   <P> The ancient high road from the west to London commenced near the <QUOTE>Pack-horse</QUOTE> inn, at Turnham Green, which lies at the western extremity of  Hammersmith, and of which we shall speak presently.   It passed through Stanford-Brook Green,  Pallenswick, and Bradmoor.   At the beginning of this century it was very narrow and impassable, though large sums of money had been spent in its repair. The road, which is now in part lined with houses, skirts the north side of Ravenscourt Park, and joins the Uxbridge Road at Shepherd's Bush.  At the junction of the <num value="2">two</num> roads formerly stood an ancient inn, where all the country travellers stopped in their journeys to or from the metropolis. This is supposed to have been the house that Miles Syndercombe hired for the purpose of carrying out his proposed assassination of Cromwell, in <datestruct VALUE="1657-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1657">1657</year></datestruct>, while on his journey from Hampton Court to London. 
    <P>Dull, dreary, and uninteresting as this part of  Hammersmith may have been in former times, it appears to have possessed at least <num value="1">one</num> curiosity the portrait of a quaint old pump, in Webb's Lane, with a sort of font in front of it to catch the water, figures in Hone's <QUOTE>Every-Day Book,</QUOTE> under  September 10th, but apparently little or nothing was or is known of its history. Under the portrait in the <QUOTE>Every-Day Book</QUOTE> are the following lines :---

    <P>Retracing our steps to the Broadway, we enter  Queen Street, which passes in a southerly direction to the Fulham   Road, from the junction of the  Broadway and Bridge Road. On the west side of this street stands the <LEMMA id="lemma.536.1">parish church, dedicated to  St. Paul</LEMMA>. It was originally a chapel of ease to  Fulham, and is remarkable as the church in which <num value="1">one</num> of the last of those romantic entombments known as heart-burials took place. The church was built during the reign of Charles I., at the cost of Sir Nicholas Crispe, a wealthy citizen of  London. 
    <P>Bowack thus describes this church in <datestruct value="1705--"><year reg="1705">1705</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>The very name of a chapel of ease sufficiently points out the causes of its erection, and indeed the great number of people inhabiting in and near this place, at such a great distance from Fulham  Church, made the erecting of a chapel long desired and talked of before it could be effected; but about the year <hi rend=italics>I</hi><num value="624">624</num> the great number of gentry residing hereabouts being sensible of the inconvenience, as well as the poorer people, began in earnest to think of this remedy; and after several of them had largely subscribed, they set about the work with all possible application.   The whole number of inhabitants who were willing to enjoy the benefit of this chapel voluntarily subscribed, and were included within the limits belonging to it upon the division, so that a.very considerable sum was secured. .      .      About the year <datestruct value="1628"><year reg="1628">1628</year></datestruct> the foundation of the chapel was laid, and the building was carried on with such expedition, that in the year <datestruct value="1631"><year reg="1631">1631</year></datestruct> it was completely finished and consecrated; though, at the west end, there is a stone fixed in the wall with this date, <datestruct value="1630"><year reg="1630">1630</year></datestruct>, which was placed there when the said end was built, probably before the inside was begun. The whole building is of brick, very spacious and regular, and at the east [west] end is a large square tower of the same with a ring of <num value="6">six</num> bells. The inside is very well finished, being beautified with several devices in painting. The ceiling also is very neatly painted, and in several compartments and ovals were finely depicted the arms of England, also roses, thistles, fleur-de-luces, &amp;c., all of which the rebels in their furious zeal dashed out, or daubed over; though this particular act was more the effect of their malice against his Majesty King Charles I., and the sacred kingly office, than their blind zeal against Popery, endeavouring, to the utmost, that the memory of a king should be expunged the world.   The glass of the chancel window was also finely painted with Moses, Aaron, &amp;c.; also the <pb id="P.537" n="537"> arms of the most considerable benefactors; but these have been much abused (probably by the same ungodly crew), as relics of Popery and superstition; however, the remains of them evince their former art and beauty, which was very   extraordinary.   In several of the other windows likewise, there are the benefactors' coats of arms, particularly Sir Nicholas Crispe's, who may be called its founder, himself giving, in money and materials, the sum of   <measure value="700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="700">700</num></measure>   towards its building. It was likewise very well paved, and pewed with wainscot, and made commodious and beautiful within; the whole charge of which was about <num value="2000">two thousand</num> and odd pounds      .   .   .   Notwithstanding the ill usage this chapel has met with, it is still in very good condition; beside this, adorned   with   several stately monuments now standing.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Such, then, was the condition of this church within <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a century of its erection. Since that time it has undergone extensive repairs on different occasions, and in the year <datestruct value="1864"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct> it was restored and enlarged.   Although the edifice is constructed of brick, it is covered throughout with stucco; and, architecturally, it is of little or no interest, excepting as a fair specimen of the corrupt style in vogue at the date of its erection. The building consists of a nave, aisles, short transepts, and chancel; the tower is surmounted by a small octagonal bell-turret. The church, which has galleries on either side and at the western end, will accommodate about i,ooo worshippers. The altarpiece is somewhat peculiar in its construction, and occupies nearly the whole eastern wall of the chancel: it may perhaps be best described as an upright <QUOTE>baldachino,</QUOTE> the canopy of which is ornamented with a number of candlesticks containing imitation candles, the flames of which are represented in gilding; beneath the canopy are festoons in carved oak, said to be the work of Grinling Gibbons. This baldachino--which is of a heavy Italian style--is of interest, as having been erected by Archbishop Laud. 
   <P>A picturesque avenue of old trees leads to the north door of the church, whilst the footpath is lined on each side by several rows of tombs, some bearing foreign names, probably of the Walloons employed in the tapestry works, or of persons who were domesticated at Brandenburgh House during the residence there of the Margrave of Anspach and his widow.

Yet his loyalty shut not up his heart against those who differed from him in opinion; his sympathies were not conventional, they were not confined to a class, but extended to all his kind. When himself in exile, he made his private misfortunes turn to public benefits; he investigated all foreign improvements and turned them to English uses; he encouraged the farmers of Middlesex in all agricultural pursuits; through his knowledge, new inventions, as to paper-mills, powder-mills, and water-mills, came into familiar use; he discovered the value of the brick-making earth in his immediate neighbourhood, and the art itself, as since practised, was principally, if not entirely, his own.</QUOTE> Sir Nicholas, shortly after the Restoration, caused to be erected in Hammersmith Church, in the south-east corner, near the pulpit, a monument of black and white marble, <num value="8">eight</num> feet in height and <num value="2">two</num> in breadth, upon which was placed a bust of the king, immediately beneath which is the following inscription :-- <QUOTE>This effigy was erected by the special appointment of Sir Nicholas Crispe, Knight and Baronet, as a grateful commemoration of that glorious martyr, King Charles the <num value="1">First</num>, of blessed memory.</QUOTE> Beneath, on a pedestal of black marble, is an urn, enclosing the heart of the brave and loyal knight, which, like the heart of Richard Coeur de Lion and that of the gallant Marquis of Montrose, has found a resting-place apart from that where his body reposes. <pb id="P.538" n="538"> On the pedestal is inscribed: <QUOTE>Within this urn is enclosed the heart of Sir Nicholas Crispe, Knight and Baronet, a loyal sharer in the sufferings of his late and present Majesty.

    <P>In Queen Street, nearly opposite the church, is a large brick mansion, which formed part of a house once the residence of Edmund Sheffield,  Earl of Mulgrave and Baron of Butterwick, who died here in the year <datestruct value="1646"><year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct>.   In <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct> the house and premises, then known as the manor-house and farm of Butterwick, were conveyed to the family of the Fernes, by whom   the old mansion was modernised and cut up into <num value="2">two</num>. Early in the last century the place was sold to Elijah Impey, father of the Indian judge of that name, whose family long resided in it. The old portion of the mansion was pulled down many years ago. The principal front of the house, as it now stands, is ornamented with <num value="4">four</num> stone classic columns, and it is surmounted by a pediment. 
   <P>On the right-hand side of the Fulham Road, which branches off from   Queen Street opposite the parish church, stands a large group of brick buildings, designed by Pugin, and known as the Convent of the Good Shepherd and the Asylum for Penitent Women. The site was formerly occupied by Beauchamp Lodge.   This charity was commenced in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct> by some ladies of the Order of the Good Shepherd, who came from Angers, in France, to carry on the work of the reformation of female penitents under the auspices of Dr. Griffiths, then <QUOTE>Vicar-Apostolic of the London District.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Further southward, opposite Alma Terrace, is Sussex House, so named from having been occasionally the residence of the late Duke of Sussex, and where his Royal Highness <QUOTE>was accustomed to steal an hour from state and ceremony, and indulge in that humble seclusion which princes must find the greatest possible luxury.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Mrs. Billington, the singer, lived here for some time; and it was for many years a celebrated house for insane patients, under the late Dr. Forbes Winslow.   In speaking of Sussex House, the Rev. J. Richardson, in his <QUOTE>Recollections,</QUOTE> tells an amusing story of a visit paid to it by Mrs. Fry, the prison philanthropist, whose restless benevolence was by the uncharitable occasionally mistaken for an impertinent propensity for prying into things with which she had no business. <QUOTE>The Rev. Mr. Clarke, son of the traveller, Dr. Clarke,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE>was at <num value="1">one</num> time confined in a lunatic asylum. His visit to the place was fortunately but a short <num value="1">one</num>, and he was pronounced perfectly 
<foreign lang=la>compos mentis</foreign>. A day or <num value="2">two</num> before he left the place he perceived, from the unusual bustle that arose, that something of consequence was about to happen; and he learnt from <num value="1">one</num> of the subordinates that no less a person than the great Mrs. Fry, attended by a staff of females, was about to inspect the establishment.   Being fond of a joke, Mr. Clarke prevailed upon <num value="1">one</num> of the keepers to introduce the lady to him. This was accordingly done. Mr. Clarke assumed the appearance of melancholy madness; the lady and her suite advanced to offer consolation and condolence; he groaned, rolled his eyes, and gibbered; they became alarmed. He made gestures indicative of a rush at the parties; they retreated towards the door in precipitation; he rose from his seat, and was in instant pursuit.   <Q lang=fr>Sauve qui peut,</Q> was the word; the retreat became a flight.   Mrs. Fry, whose size and age prevented celerity of movement, was upset in the attempt; the sisterhood were involved in her fall; their screams were mingled with the simulated howlings of the supposed maniac; and it was with some difficulty that they were eventually removed from the floor and out of the room.   I believe,</QUOTE> continues Mr. Richardson, <QUOTE>that Mrs. Fry did not again extend her researches into the mysteries of lunatic asylums.</QUOTE> 
   <P>On the right-hand side of the Fulham   Road, nearly opposite Sussex House, and with its gardens and grounds stretching away to the water-side, stood Brandenburgh House, a mansion which in its time passed through various vicissitudes.   According to Lysons, it was built early in the reign of Charles I. by Sir Nicholas Crispe, of whom we have spoken above in our account of the parish church, at a cost of nearly <measure value="23000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="23000">23,000</num></measure>. Sir Nicholas was himself the inventor of the art of making bricks as now practised. 
   <P>During the Civil War in <datestruct VALUE="1647-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct>, when the Parliamentary army was stationed at Hammersmith, this house was plundered by the troops and General Fairfax took up his quarters there; Sir Nicholas being then in France, whither he had retired when the king's affairs became desperate and he could be of no further use.   His estates were, of course, confiscated; but he, nevertheless, managed to assist Charles II. when in exile with money, and aided General Monk in bringing about the Restoration.   He had, it seems, entered largely into commercial transactions with   Guinea, and had built upon its coast the fort of Cormantine. In his old age he once more settled down in his mansion on the banks of the Thames, and dying there, the house was sold by his successor to the celebrated Prince Rupert, nephew of Charles I., so renowned in the Civil Wars.   It was settled by the prince upon his mistress, Margaret Hughes, a much admired actress in the reign of Charles II. She owned the house nearly <num value="10">ten</num> years.   It was afterwards occupied by different persons of inferior <pb id="P.540" n="540"> note, until, in <datestruct value="1748--"><year reg="1748">1748</year></datestruct>, it became the residence of George Bubb Dodington, afterwards Lord Melcombe, who completely altered and modernised it.   He added a magnificent gallery for statues and antiquities, of which the floor was inlaid with various marbles, and the door-case supported by columns richly ornamented with <hi rend=italics>lapis lazuli</hi>. He also gave to the house the name of <hi rend=italics>La Trappe,</hi>
after a celebrated monastery; and at the same time inscribed the following   lines beneath   a   bust of Comus placed in the hall :

   <P>Of Bubb Dodington, Lord Melcombe, we have already spoken in our notice of Pall Mall;<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="123">123</num>.</NOTE> but more remains to be narrated. His original name was George Bubb, and he was the son of an apothecary in Dorsetshire, where he was born in <datestruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>. He added the name of Dodington in compliment to his uncle, Mr. George Dodington, who was <num value="1">one</num> of the Lords of the Admiralty during the reigns of William III., Queen Anne, and George I., and whose fortune he inherited. Mr. S. Carter Hall, in his <QUOTE>Pilgrimages to English Shrines,</QUOTE> writes :-- <QUOTE>His amount of mind seems to have consisted in a large share of worldly wisdom, which enriched himself, a total want of conscience in political movements, and a safety-loving desire of being on friendly terms with literary men and satirists, that his faults and follies might be overlooked under the shadow   of his patronage.   In his Diary, he coolly details acts of political knavery that would condemn any man, without appearing at all to feel their impropriety. His face would have delighted Lavater, so exactly characteristic is it of a well-fed mindless worldling.</QUOTE> <pb id="P.541" n="541"> 
   <P>Bubb Dodington's great failing seems to have been want of respect to himself. <QUOTE>His talents, his fortune, his rank, and his connections,</QUOTE> says a writer in the <hi rend=italics>European Magazine</hi> for <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>were sufficient to have placed him   in a very elevated situation of life, had he regarded his own character and the advantages which belonged to him; by neglecting these, he passed through the world without much satisfaction to himself, with little respect from the public, and no advantage to his country.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Richard Cumberland, whilst residing with his father at the rectory at Fulham, formed an acquaintance with this celebrated nobleman, and, in the diary which he published, he tells us that Dodington 
<FIGURE id="Fig.541" n="2000.14.0204"><HEAD>Hammersmith In <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct>.   (From Rocque's Map.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 was pleased to call his villa <QUOTE>La Trappe,</QUOTE> and his inmates and familiars the <QUOTE>Monks</QUOTE> of the Convent. <QUOTE>These,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>were Mr. Wyndham, his relation, whom he made his heir; Sir William Breton, Privy-Purse to the king; and Dr. Thomson, a physician out of practice.   These gentlemen formed a very curious society of very opposite characters: in short, it was a <hi rend=italics>trio</hi>, consisting of a misanthrope, a courtier, and a quack.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In each of his tawdry mansions Dodington was only to be approached through a long suite of apartments, bedecked with gilding and a profusion of finery; and when the visitor reached the fat deity of the place, he was found enthroned under painted ceilings and gilt entablatures. <QUOTE>Of pictures,</QUOTE> <pb id="P.542" n="542"> says Cumberland, <QUOTE>he seemed to take his estimate only by their cost; in fact, he was not possessed of any. But I recollect his saying to me <num value="1">one</num> day, in his great saloon at Eastbury, that if he had half a score of pictures of <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> a-piece, he would gladly decorate his walls with them; in place of which, I am sorry to say, he had stuck up immense patches of gilt leather, shaped into bugle-horns, upon hangings of rich crimson velvet, and round his state bed he displayed a carpeting of gold and silver embroidery, which too glaringly betrayed its derivation from coat, waistcoat, and breeches by the testimony of pockets, button-holes, and loops, with other equally incontrovertible witnesses subpcenaed from the tailor's shop-board.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Dr. Johnson was an occasional visitor here. <num value="1">One</num> evening the doctor happening to go out into the garden when there was a storm of wind and rain, Dodington remarked to him that it was a dreadful night. <QUOTE>No, sir,</QUOTE> replied the doctor, in a most reverential tone, <QUOTE>it is a very fine night. The Lord is abroad.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Dodington's gardens are mentioned by Lady Lepel Hervey as showing <QUOTE>the finest bloom and the greatest promise of fruit.</QUOTE> The approach to the mansion was conspicuous for a large and handsome obelisk, surmounted   by an urn   of bronze, containing the heart of his wife. On the disposal of the house by his heir, this obelisk found its way to the park of Lord Ailesbury, at Tottenham, in Wiltshire, where it was set up to commemorate the <hi rend=italics>recovery</hi> of George III.   On <num value="1">one</num> side of its base the following inscription was placed:-- <QUOTE>In commemoration of a signal instance of Heaven's protecting Providence over these kingdoms, in the year <datestruct value="1789"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>, by restoring to perfect health, from a long and afflicting disorder, their excellent and beloved Sovereign, George the <num value="3">Third</num>: this tablet was inscribed by Thomas Bruce, Earl of Ailesbury.</QUOTE> The inscription may possibly afford a useful hint as to the various purposes to which obelisks may be applied when purchased at <num value="2">second</num>-hand. 
   <P>After the death of Lord Melcombe, the house was occupied for a time by a Mrs. Sturt, who here gave entertainments, which were honoured with the presence of royalty and the <hi rend=italics>elite</hi> of fashion. Sir Gilbert Elliot, in a letter to his wife, dated <datestruct VALUE="1789-06-13"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=13>13</day>, <year reg=1789>1789</year></datestruct>, writes :-- <QUOTE>Last night we were all at a masquerade at Hammersmith, given by Mrs. Sturt.

   <P>In <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct> the place was sold to the Margrave of Brandenburgh-Anspach, who, shortly after his marriage, in the previous year, to the sister of the Earl of Berkeley, and widow of William, Lord Craven, had transferred his estates to the King of Prussia for a fair annuity, and had settled down in England. His Highness died in <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, but the Margravine continued to make this house her chief residence for many years afterwards.   She was a lady in whose personal history there were many odds and ends with which she did not wish her neighbours or the public to be acquainted.   A good story is told of her butler, an Irishman, to whom she <num value="1">one</num> day gave a guinea in order to set a seal on his lips as to some early indiscretion which he knew or had found out. The money, however, took him to a tavern, where, in a circle of friends, he grew warm and communicative, and at last blabbed out the secret which he had been fee'd to keep within his breast. The story coming round to her ears, the lady reproached him for his conduct, when Pat wittily replied, <QUOTE>Ah! your ladyship should not have given me the money, but have let me remain sober. I'm just like a hedge-hog, my lady: when I am wetted, I open at once.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The Margravine made   many   alterations in the mansion, which was now named Brandenburgh House, and the principal apartments were filled with paintings by such masters as Murillo, Rubens, Cuyp, Reynolds, and Gainsborough, and adorned with painted ceilings, Sdvres vases, and marble busts. A small theatre was erected in the garden, near the river-side, where the Margravine often gratified the lovers of the drama <QUOTE>by exerting her talents both as a writer and performer.</QUOTE> The theatre is described by Mr. Henry Angelo, in his <QUOTE>Reminiscences,</QUOTE> as small, commodious, and beautifully decorated. <QUOTE>There was a parterre, and also side-boxes. The Margrave's box was at the back of the pit, and was usually occupied by the <hi rend=italics>elite</hi> of the company, the <hi rend=italics>corps dipomatique,</hi>
&amp;c., &amp;c. The Margravine, on all occasions, was the <hi rend=italics>prima donna</hi>, and mostly performed juvenile characters; but whether she   represented   the heroine or the <hi rend=italics>soubrette</hi>, her personal appearance and her talents are said to have captivated every heart.</QUOTE> Angelo, at her invitation, became <num value="1">one</num> of her standing <hi rend=italics>dramatis personae</hi>, and acted here <hi rend=italics>en amateur</hi> for several years. He tells many amusing stories concerning the performances here on the <pb id="P.543" n="543"> Margrave's birthday, when a gay party assembled, and the   Margrave's plate was displayed on the sideboard as a <hi rend=italics>finale</hi>-plate which, at Rundell's, <QUOTE>cost <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">two thousand</num>   pounds</measure> more than that of Queen Charlotte.</QUOTE> 
   <P>John Timbs, in his <QUOTE>London and Westminster,</QUOTE> says <QUOTE>the Margravine must have been a grandiose woman.   She kept <num value="30">thirty</num> servants in livery, besides grooms, and a stud of <num value="60">sixty</num> horses, in which she took   much delight.   At the   rehearsals of her private theatricals she condescended to permit the attendance of her tradesmen and their families; and on the days of performance, Hammersmith Broadway used to be blocked up with fashionable equipages, while the theatre itself was crowded with nobles, courtiers, and high-born dames.</QUOTE> 
   <P>After <num value="20">twenty</num> years' residence at Hammersmith, the Margravine of Anspach went to live at Naples. She had previously parted piecemeal with most of the costly treasures which adorned her mansion, and its next occupant was the unhappy Queen Caroline, wife of George IV., who here kept up her small rival court pending her trial in the House of Lords.   During the trial she received here legions of congratulatory, sympathetic, and consolatory effusions; so much so, that the neighbourhood of the mansion was kept in a constant state   of turmoil.   Indeed, as Theodore   Hook wrote at the time in the Tory <hi rend=italics>John Bull,--</hi>

    <P>When the <QUOTE>Bill of Pains and Penalties</QUOTE> was at last abandoned, the Hammersmith tradesmen who served her illuminated their houses, and the populace shouted and made bonfires in front of Brandenburgh House. After her acquittal, the poor queen publicly returned thanks for that issue in Hammersmith Church, and more deputations came to Brandenburgh House to congratulate her on her triumph.   She did not, however, long survive the degradation to which she had been subjected, for on the <datestruct VALUE="1821-08-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>, she here breathed her last.

It was a pouring wet day. The imposing cavalcade of sable-clad horsemen who preceded and followed the hearse were drenched to the skin. The procession was an incongruous medley of charity-girls and Latymer-boys, strewing flowers in the mud; of aldermen and barristers, of private carriages and hired mourning-coaches, of Common Councilmen and Life-Guards; wound up by a hearse covered with tattered velvet drapery, to which foil-paper escutcheons had been rudely tacked on, and preceded by Sir George Naylor, Garter King-at-Arms, with a cotton-velvet cushion, on which was placed a trumpery sham   crown, made of pasteboard, Dutch-metal, and glass beads, and probably worth about eighteenpence.   How this sweep's May-day <hi rend=italics>cortege</hi>, dipped in black ink, floundered through the mud and slush, through Hammersmith to Kensington, Knightsbridge, and the Park, with a block--up of wagons, a tearing-up of the road, and a fight between the mob and soldiers at every turnpike, and at last at every street-corner; how pistol-shots were fired and sabre-cuts given, and people killed in the Park; how the executors squabbled with Garter over the dead queen's coffin; how the undertakers tried to take the procession up the Edgware Road, and the populace insisted   upon   its being carried through the City; and how at last, late in the afternoon, all draggle-tailed, torn, bruised, and bleeding, this lamentable funeral got into Fleet Street, passed through the City, and staggered out by Shoreditch to Harwich, where the coffin was bumped into a barge, hoisted on board a of- <pb id="P.544" n="544"> manwar, and taken to Stade, and at last to Brunswick, where, by the side of him who fell at Jena and him who died at Quatre Bras, the ashes of the wretched princess were permitted to rest;--all these matters you may find set down with a grim and painful minuteness in the newspapers and pamphlets of the day. It is good to recall them, if only for a moment, and in their broad outlines; for the remembrance of these bygone scandals should surely increase our gratitude for the better government we now enjoy.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In less than a twelvemonth after the death of Queen Caroline, the materials of Brandenburgh House were sold by auction, and the mansion was pulled down. A large factory now occupies its site, and in the grounds, fronting the Fulham Road, has been erected a house, to which the name of <QUOTE>Brandenburgh</QUOTE> has been given; but this is occupied as a lunatic asylum. 
   <P>About a quarter of a mile westward of the spot whereon stood Brandenburgh House is <LEMMA id="lemma.544.1">Hammersmith Suspension Bridge</LEMMA>, which, crossing the river Thames, joins Hammersmith with Barnes. This bridge, which was completed in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, was the <num value="1">first</num> constructed on the suspension principle in the vicinity of London.   It is a light and elegant structure, nearly <num value="700">700</num> feet long and <num value="20">twenty</num> feet wide; its central span is <num value="422">422</num> feet. The roadway, which is <num value="16">sixteen</num> feet above high-water mark, is suspended by <num value="8">eight</num> chains, arranged in <num value="4">four</num> double lines; and the suspension towers rise nearly <num value="50">fifty</num> feet above the level of the roadway. The bridge, which cost about   <measure value="80000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="80000">80,000</num></measure>, was designed by Mr. Tierney Clarke. 
    <P>Facing the river, from the Suspension Bridge westward to Chiswick, stretches the Mall, once the fashionable part of Hammersmith.   It is divided into the Upper and Lower Malls by a narrow creek, which runs northwards towards the main road.   Over this creek, and almost at its conflux with the Thames, is a wooden foot-bridge, known as the High Bridge, which was erected by Bishop Sherlock in <datestruct value="1751--"><year reg="1751">1751</year></datestruct>. In this part of the shores of the Thames almost every spot teems with reminiscences of poets, men of letters, and artists: let us therefore

    <P>In fact, there is scarcely an acre on the Middlesex shore which is not associated with the names of  Cowley, Pope, Gay, Collins, Thomson, and other bards of song. 
    <P>The <QUOTE>Doves</QUOTE> coffee-house, just over the High  Bridge and at the commencement of the Upper  Mall, was <num value="1">one</num> of the favourite resting-places of  James Thomson in his long walks between London and his cottage at Richmond; and, according to the local tradition, it was here that he caught some of his wintry aspirations when he was meditating his poem on <QUOTE>The Seasons.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The <Q>Doves</Q> is still in existence,</QUOTE> says Mr. Robert Bell, in <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>between the Upper and Lower Malls, and is approachable only by a narrow path winding through a cluster of houses. A terrace at the back, upon which are placed some tables, roofed over by trained limetrees, commands extensive views of <num value="2">two</num> reaches of the stream, and the opposite shore is so flat and monotonous that the place affords a favourable position for studying the chilliest and most mournful, though perhaps not the most picturesque, aspects of the winter season.</QUOTE> On <num value="1">one</num> of his pedestrian   journeys, Thomson, finding   himself fatigued and overheated on arriving at Hammersmith, imprudently took a boat to Kew, contrary to his usual custom. The keen air of the river produced a chill, which the walk up to his house failed to remove, and the next day he was ill with a <QUOTE>tertian</QUOTE> fever.   He died a few days later, within a fortnight of completing his <num value="48">forty-eighth</num> year. 
   <P>Among the noted residents in the Lower Mall, in the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, was the ingenious and versatile Sir Samuel Morland, of whom we have already spoken in our account of Vauxhall.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="448">448</num>.</NOTE>   Sir Samuel came to live here in <datestruct value="1684--"><year reg="1684">1684</year></datestruct>.

He showed us his invention of writing, which was very ingenious; also his wooden kalender <hi rend=italics>(sic),</hi>
which instructed him all by feeling; and other pretty and useful inventions of mills, pumps, &amp;c.; and the pump he had erected that serves water to his garden and to passengers, with an inscription, and brings from a filthy part of the Thames neere it a most perfect and pure water. He had newly buried     <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure> worth of music-books <num value="6">six</num> feet under ground, being, as he said, love-songs and vanity.

    <P>Sir Samuel died here in <datestruct value="1696--"><year reg="1696">1696</year></datestruct>, and was buried in the parish church. There is a print of him after a painting by Sir Peter Lely. Sir Edward  Nevill, a judge of the Common Pleas, purchased  Sir Samuel Morland's house, and came to reside <pb id="P.545" n="545"> in it in <datestruct value="1703--"><year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct>.    He died here <num value="2">two</num> years afterwards. 
    <P>In the Upper Mall a few old-fashioned houses of the better class are still standing, but their aristocratic occupants have long since migrated to more fashionable quarters.   The Mall is in parts shaded by tall elms, which afford by their shade a pleasant promenade along the river-side.  These trees are not only some of the finest specimens of their kind in the west of London, but are objects of historic interest, having been planted nearly <num value="200">two hundred</num> years ago by Queen  Catharine, widow of Charles II., who resided here for some years in the summer season; her town residence, during the reign of James II., as we have already stated, was at Somerset House.<NOTE>See Vol. II., p. <num value="92">92</num>.</NOTE>
 She returned to Portugal in <datestruct value="1692--"><year reg="1692">1692</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>In   the reign   of Queen Anne, the famous physician, Dr. Radcliffe, whom we have already mentioned in our account of Kensington Palace, had a house here; he intended to have converted it into a public hospital, and the work was commenced, but was left unfinished at his death. Sir  Christopher Wintringham, physician to George III., lived for some time in the same house. In the  Upper Mall, too, resided William Lloyd, the nonjuring Bishop of Norwich.   Another inhabitant of the Mall was a German, named Weltje, who, having made a fortune as <num value="1">one</num> of the <hi rend=italics>maitres de cuisine</hi> at Carlton House, settled down here as a gentleman, and kept open house, entertaining many of those who had sat as guests at the tables of royalty. He is repeatedly mentioned, in terms of regard, by Mr. H. Angelo, in his agreeable <QUOTE>Reminiscences.</QUOTE> He was a great favourite with his royal master. An alderman was dining <num value="1">one</num> day at  Carlton House when the prince asked him whether he did not think that there was a very strange taste in the soup? <QUOTE>I think there is, sir,</QUOTE> replied the alderman. <QUOTE>Send for Weltje,</QUOTE> said the prince.  When he made his appearance the prince told him why he had sent for him. Weltje called to <num value="1">one</num> of the pages, <QUOTE>Give me de spoon,</QUOTE> and putting it into the tureen, after tasting it several times, said, <QUOTE>Boh, boh! very goot</QUOTE> and immediately disappeared from the room, leaving the spoon on the table, much to the amusement of the heir apparent. Among Weltje's visitors at Hammersmith were John Banister, the comedian; Rowlandson, the caricaturist; and a host of poets, actors, painters, and musicians. 
   <P>On the Terrace, which also overlooks the river, at the farther end of the Mall, resided for many years Arthur Murphy, the dramatist, and witty friend of Burke and Johnson.   Here, too, lived the painter and quack, Philip James Loutherbourg, a native of Strasbourg, who came to England in <datestruct value="1771--"><year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct>. He was employed by Garrick to paint the scenes for Drury Lane Theatre, and in a few years he obtained the full honours of the Royal Academy. Whatever notoriety Loutherbourg may have lacked as a painter was made up to him as a <QUOTE>quack;</QUOTE> for he had been caught by the strange empirical mania at that time so prevalent all over Europe. He became a physician, a visionary, a prophet, and a charlatan. His treatment of the patients who flocked to him was undoubtedly founded on the practice of Mesmer; though Horace Walpole appears to draw a distinction between the curative methods of the <num value="2">two</num> doctors when he writes to the Countess of Ossory, <datestruct VALUE="1789-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>: <QUOTE>Loutherbourg, the painter, is turned an inspired physician, and has <num value="3000">three   thousand</num>   patients.

Crowds surrounded the painter's house, so that it was with difficulty he could go in and out.   Particular days were set apart and advertised in the newspapers as <QUOTE>healing days,</QUOTE> and a portion of the house was given up as a <QUOTE>healing-room.</QUOTE> Patients were admitted to the presence of the artist-physician by tickets only, and to obtain possession of these it is said that <num value="3000">three thousand</num> people were to be seen waiting at <num value="1">one</num> time. In the end, the failure of <num value="1">one</num> of Loutherbourg's pretended <QUOTE>miracles</QUOTE> led to his house being besieged by a riotous mob, and he was compelled to make his escape in the best way he could. He, however, subsequently returned to his old quarters at Hammersmith, where he died in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>. He was buried in Chiswick Churchyard, near the grave of Hogarth. <pb id="P.546" n="546"> 
   <P>Besides the personages we have mentioned above, Hammersmith has numbered among its residents many others who have risen to eminence; among them William   Belsham, the essayist and historian, who here wrote the greater part of his <QUOTE>History of Great Britain to the Peace of Amiens,</QUOTE> and who died here in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>.   Charles Burney, the Greek scholar, who here kept a school for some time, towards the close of the last century, until his preferment to the vicarage of Deptford; and William   Sheridan, Bishop of Kilmore, who was deprived for refusing the oath of allegiance to William   III., and who died in <datestruct value="1711--"><year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct> , and now reposes in the parish church.

   <P>Leigh Hunt-who, if we may trust Mr. Planche, was not well off during his later years-lived here in a small house, and spent, among friends and books, the last few years of his life.   Mr. Forster, in his <QUOTE>Life of Dickens,</QUOTE> thus mentions him : <QUOTE>Any kind of extravagance or oddity came from Hunt's lips with a curious fascination. There was surely never a man of so sunny a nature, who could draw so much pleasure from common things, or to whom books were a world so real, so exhaustless, so delightful. I was only <num value="17">seventeen</num> when I derived from him   the tastes which have been the solace of all subsequent years; and I well remember the last time I saw him   at Hammersmith, not long before his death in <datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>, when, with his delicate, worn, but keenly-intellectual face, his large luminous eyes, his thick shock of wiry grey hair, and little cape of faded black silk over his shoulders, he looked like an old French abbe. He was buoyant and pleasant as ever, and was busy upon a vindication of Chaucer and Spenser against Cardinal Wiseman, who had attacked them for alleged sensuous and voluptuous qualities.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Mr. Bayard Taylor, in a letter in the <hi rend=italics>New York Tribune</hi>, thus describes a visit which he paid here in <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct> to Leigh Hunt:-- <QUOTE>The old poet lives in a neat little cottage in Hammersmith, quite alone, since the recent death of his wife. That dainty grace which is the chief charm   of his poetry yet lives in his person and manners.   He is seventythree years old, but the effects of age are only physical: they have not touched that buoyant joyous nature which survives in spite of sorrow and misfortune.      His deep-set eyes still beam with a soft, cheerful, earnest light; his voice is gentle and musical; and his hair, although almost <pb id="P.547" n="547">

It was grateful to me to press the same palm which Keats and Shelley had so often clasped in friendly warmth, and to hear him who knew them so well speak of them as long-lost companions. He has a curious collection of locks of the hair of poets, from Milton to Browning.    <Q>That thin tuft of brown silky fibres, could it really have been shorn from Milton's head?</Q>  I asked myself.  <Q>Touch it,</Q>  said Leigh Hunt,  <Q> and then you will have touched Milton's self.</Q>   <Q>There is a life in hair, though it be dead,</Q>  said I; as I did so, repeating a line from   Hunt's own sonnet on this lock.   Shelley's hair was golden and very soft; Keats's a bright brown, curling in large Bacchic rings; Dr. Johnson's grey, with a harsh and wiry feel; Dean   Swift's both   brown   and grey, but finer, denoting a more sensitive organisation; and Charles Lamb's reddish-brown, short, and strong. I was delighted to hear Hunt speak of poems which he still designed to write, as if the age of verse should never cease with <num value="1">one</num> in whom the faculty is born.</QUOTE> We have mentioned Leigh Hunt's death in our account of Putney. 
   <P>At the western end of the town, a little to the north of the Terrace, stands <LEMMA id="lemma.548.1">St. Peter's Church</LEMMA>. It is a substantial Grecian-Ionic structure, and was erected in <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, from   the designs of Mr. Edward Lapidge; the total cost, including the expense of enclosing the ground, amounted to about ,<measure value="12000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="12000">12,000</num></measure>.

   <P>In the year <datestruct value="1804"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct> the inhabitants of this locality were much alarmed by a nocturnal appearance, which for a considerable time eluded detection or discovery, and which became notorious as the 
<LEMMA id="lemma.548.2">Hammersmith Ghost</LEMMA>.   In January of the above year, some unknown person made it his diversion to alarm the inhabitants by assuming the figure of a spectre; and the report of its appearance had created so much alarm that few would venture out of their houses after dusk, unless upon urgent business.   This sham ghost had certainly much to answer for. <num value="1">One</num> poor woman, while crossing near the churchyard about <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock at night, beheld something, as she described it, rise from the tombstones.   The figure was very tall and very white! She attempted to run, but the supposed ghost soon overtook her; and pressing her in his arms, she fainted, in which situation she remained some hours, till discovered by the neighbours, who kindly led her home, when she took to her bed, and died <num value="2">two</num> days afterwards. A wagoner, while driving a team of <num value="8">eight</num> horses, conveying <num value="16">sixteen</num> passengers, was also so alarmed that he took to   his heels, and left the wagon, horses, and passengers in the greatest danger.   Faulkner tells us, in his <QUOTE>History of Hammersmith,</QUOTE> that neither man, woman, nor child could pass that way for some time; and the report was that it was <QUOTE>the apparition of a man who cut his throat in the neighbourhood</QUOTE> about a year previously. Several lay in wait on different nights for the ghost; but there were so many by-lanes and paths leading to Hammersmith, that he was always sure of being in that which was unguarded, and every night played off his tricks, to the terror of the passengers. A young man, however, who had more courage than the rest of his neighbours, determined to watch the proceedings of this visitant of the other world; he accordingly placed himself in a secluded spot, armed with a gun, and as near the spot as possible where the <QUOTE>ghost</QUOTE> had been seen. He had not remained long in his hiding-place when he heard the sound of footsteps advancing, and immediately challenged the supposed spirit; but not receiving any answer, he fired at the object. A deep groan was heard, and upon a light being procured it was discovered that a poor bricklayer, who was passing that way from   his work on that evening rather later than usual, and who had on a new flannel jacket, was the innocent cause of this unfortunate occurrence.   The young man was tried for murder and acquitted.

<p><NOTE RESP=BOLLES><LEMMA id="lemma.549.1">Ice on Thames near Chiswick</LEMMA></NOTE> 
<P>It is curious to note how   the gradual--or, we might perhaps say, rapid--extension of the metropolis is affecting the once out-lying towns and villages in its immediate vicinity on both sides of the river.   Many places, indeed, as we have already seen, such as Paddington and Bayswater, Stoke Newington   and   Hackney, Clapham   and Camberwell, have already become entirely absorbed into the gigantic city; whilst others are so rapidly increasing in size that they, too, will soon lose all signs of a separate existence. Chiswick, which lies on the bend of the river between Turnham Green and Brentford, still retains many of its rural charms, although their effacement by the hand of the builder may be perhaps but the work of a few years. To a certain extent, however, this progress is apparent even so far west as Chiswick, which we design to form the limit of our journeyings in this direction. 
   <P>Chiswick is not found in Doomsday-Book, but it is mentioned in the various records of Henry III. by the name of <QUOTE>Chesewicke.</QUOTE> According to the Saxon Chronicle, a battle was fought between Chiswick and Turnham Green between Edmund Ironside and the Danes, who were bent on attacking London, approaching it by the Roman road across the <QUOTE>Back Common,</QUOTE> as it is now called, but which was the only entrance to the metropolis from the west, the present western road dating no further back than about the eighteenth, or perhaps the close of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. A presumed proof of the antiquity of this road across the <QUOTE>Back Common</QUOTE> is to be found in the urn containing Roman coins dug up <foreign lang=la>in situ</foreign> in the year <datestruct value="1731"><year reg="1731">1731</year></datestruct>, concerning which discovery we shall have more to say presently. With this single fact we must be content with regard to the early history of Chiswick, till we come to the reign of Henry II., when the Doomsday-Book of St. Paul's, in an Inquisition into the manor and churches belonging to the metropolitan cathedral, alludes to the <QUOTE>status Ecclesiae de Sutton</QUOTE> --Sutton, i.e., South Town, being the popular name for that part of Chiswick which lay between Turnham   Green and the river Thames. 
    <P>In this document we find an account of the glebe, titles, and pension payable to the vicar; and it is worthy of note that now, after the lapse of nearly <num value="700">seven hundred</num> years, there is still paid to the vicar by the Chapter of St. Paul's a <QUOTE>pension</QUOTE> of <measure value="13s." type=currency><num value="13">thirteen</num> shillings</measure> annually, and another of <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> to   the   chapter by   the vicar.   From another inquisition, dated <datestruct value="1222--"><year reg="1222">1222</year></datestruct>, we learn that the then <QUOTE>Firmarius</QUOTE> of the Manor had made a collection of Peter's pence; but, it is added, <QUOTE>sibi retinet,</QUOTE> he keeps it for himself.   If this <QUOTE>Firmarius</QUOTE> was, as is suspected, a member of the Chapter of London, his act was a <QUOTE>robbing of Peter to pay Paul,</QUOTE> and possibly may have given rise to the saying. 
   <P>The same source of information tells us that at <QUOTE>Sutton</QUOTE> there was a <QUOTE>parva capella</QUOTE> attached to the manor-house; and as the population in this part has very much increased of late years, a new church has been erected recently, almost on the site of the former fabric. 
   <P>In <datestruct value="1570--"><year reg="1570">1570</year></datestruct>, Gabriel Goodman, Prebendary of St. Paul's, becoming Dean of Westminster, <QUOTE>diverted</QUOTE> the manor of Chiswick from the cathedral to the abbey.   It was perhaps in consequence of the new tie thus springing up that a <QUOTE>Pest House</QUOTE> was built on Chiswick Mall for the use of the Westminster scholars.   It was a plain and substantial building, comprising a house, dormitory, and school; and it is a matter of history that during the time of the great plague the school or <QUOTE>College of St. Peter's</QUOTE> at Westminster was carried on at Chiswick by Dr. Busby without interruption to the regular studies.   The Pest House was pulled down only a few years ago, and its site is now covered by modern villas. During the demolition of this building it was discovered that some of its walls were as old as the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century. But we are anticipating. 
   <P>If Chiswick is approached by way of the Thames, but little of it is seen, as it lies opposite a small <pb id="P.550" n="550"> island of osiers-called Chiswick Ait or Eyotwhich nearly hides it from public view. Thus the steamers rather avoid the place, and all that can be seen of it is perhaps the spire of the old church and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of the pleasant houses in the Mall, which runs along the river's bank, almost a continuation of that of Hammersmith, mentioned in the preceding chapter.   The visitor to Chiswick, approaching by land, may find it rather an outof- the-way place.   It is true that part of it, Turnham   Green, on the north side, lies on the high road at the western end of Hammersmith, but Chiswick proper lies off the high road and nearer the river, and it is only by walking that <num value="1">one</num> can get at the place; but the walk thither will be well repaid for the trouble taken in accomplishing it. Whatever alterations may pass over this once pretty village, it will always be a spot that the student of English history and English manners will regard with a fair amount of interest, for the sake of several men of mark who have lived or died in its neighbourhood. 
   <P>The <LEMMA id="lemma.550.1">parish church</LEMMA> stands near the river, and is dedicated to St. Nicholas, the patron saint of fishermen, who, at the time of its erection, as now, formed the majority of the parishioners.   The present structure, though adorned with a handsome tower, is disfigured by a fair share of the deformities of the architecture of the eighteenth century, and in other respects is quite in harmony with its sister edifices which grace-or disgrace--the valley of the Thames between London and Windsor. It consisted originally of only a nave and chancel, and was built about the beginning of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century, at which time the tower was erected at the charge and cost of William Bordal, vicar of the parish, who died in <datestruct value="1435--"><year reg="1435">1435</year></datestruct>. The tower is built of stone and flint, as was originally the north wall of the church.   Some aisles or transepts of brick, in the hideous style of the Georgian era, jut out on either side, <num value="1">one</num> of them bearing the ominous date of <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, and the other of <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>. These excrescences were <num value="1">first</num> erected in the shape of transepts; but as the population increased, and more space was needed, they were extended   westward, and, so far as they can be described at all, ought perhaps to be termed aisles by courtesy. Recently some improvements and partial restorations have been made in the interior: the pews have given place to low open benches, an organ-chamber has been erected, the west window opened, and the chancel rebuilt and decorated in true ecclesiastical taste, and a new memorial east window inserted.   Still, the inside of the nave is a most barn-like structure; and a modern roof, which not many years ago replaced the original handsome open timber-roof of the pre-Reformation era, looks heavy and cumbrous to a degree. 
    <P>Taking a general view of the interior of the church, we may say that, with the single exception of Bath Abbey, we never saw   a sacred edifice whose walls are more hideously disfigured with <QUOTE>pedimental blotches,</QUOTE> in the shape of marble mural monuments.   These are of every date, from the fine classical piece of sculpture which commemorates <num value="1">one</num> of the Chaloners of Elizabeth's reign-Sir Thomas   Chaloner, a   distinguished chemist, in the boldest possible relief, and the more modest and retiring tablet which, adorned with a pile of Bibles on either side, records the virtues of the wife of Dr. Walker, a Puritan minister during the Commonwealth, who signalised his incumbency by the <num value="1">first</num> enlargement of the church, and by substituting the <QUOTE>Directory</QUOTE> for the Prayer-book-down to the present century.  Among them are monuments to such a cloud of peers and peeresses and honourables, as ought to gladden the heart of <QUOTE>Garter</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>Ulster</QUOTE> himself. There is <num value="1">one</num> to a Duchess of Somerset; another to <num value="1">one</num> of the Burlingtons; <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> to the relatives of Sir Robert Walpole, all titled individuals; and another, very handsome of its kind, to <num value="1">one</num> of Nature's gentlemen, Thomas Bentley, the able and public-spirited   partner of Josiah  Wedgwood, who resided in the parish, and whose virtues it commemorates.   Bentley lived in a large and substantial mansion in the high road leading from   Hammersmith to Turnham   Green, now (or lately) occupied by Mr. Vaughan Morgan.  The bas-reliefs, of which he speaks so often in his correspondence with Wedgwood, still grace the walls of the house, which (if we except a few additions) is much in the same state as when owned by Bentley. 
   <P>Garrick erected the monument in the chancel to his friend Charles Holland, the actor, who died at Chiswick House; and he also wrote the inscription. Charles Holland was the son of John Holland, a baker of Chiswick, where he was baptised <datestruct VALUE="1733-04-3"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=3>3rd</day>, <year reg=1733>1733</year></datestruct>.   He was apprenticed to a turpentine merchant; but strongly imbued with a predilection for the stage, and praised for the display of that talent in his private circle, he applied to Garrick, who gave him good encouragement, but advised him <QUOTE>punctually to fulfil his engagement with his master, and should he then find his passion for the theatre unabated, to apply to him again.</QUOTE> This advice he followed; and under Garrick's auspices made his 
<hi rend=italics>debut</hi> at Drury Lane Theatre, in <datestruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>, in the part of <hi rend=italics>Oronooko</hi>.   He distinguished himself principally <pb id="P.551" n="551"> in the characters of <hi rend=italics>Richard III., Hamlet, Pierre, Timur</hi> in <QUOTE>Zingis,</QUOTE> and <hi rend=italics>Manley</hi> in <QUOTE>The Plain Dealer.</QUOTE> Holland was a zealous admirer and follower of Garrick; and, as a player, continued to advance in reputation. His last performance was the part of <hi rend=italics>Prospero</hi>, in Shakespeare's <QUOTE>Tempest,</QUOTE> <datestruct VALUE="1769-11-20"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=20>20th</day>, <year reg=1769>1769</year></datestruct>; and he died of the smallpox   on   <datestruct VALUE="-12-7"><month reg="12">December</month>   <day reg=7>7th</day></datestruct>   following.      His   body was deposited in the family vault in Chiswick churchyard on the <num value="15">15th</num> of the same month; and his funeral was attended by most of the performers belonging to Drury Lane Theatre. 
    <P>In the church, in the north wall of the chancel is raised a marble monument, on which is engraved the following inscription, in a circular compartment, surmounted by an admirable bust : 
    <QUOTE REND=blockquote> If Talents to make entertainment instruction, to support the credit of the Stage by just and manly Action; If to adorn Society by Virtues which would honour any Rank and Profession, deserve remembrance: Let <hi rend=italics>Him</hi> with whom these <hi rend=italics>Talents</hi> were long exerted, To whom these <hi rend=italics>Virtues</hi>

Garrick</emph>.</QUOTE>
 A view of Holland's monument is given in Smith's <QUOTE>Historical and Literary Curiosities.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Among the other parishioners buried in the church are several members of an old Berkshire family, the Barkers, whose name is still kept in memory by <QUOTE>Barker's Rails,</QUOTE> opposite Mortlake: a place well known to all oarsmen as the goal of the  University boat-races. 
    <P>The tower contains a peal of <num value="5">five</num> bells. The curfew was rung every evening   at Chiswick as recently as <num value="20">twenty</num> years ago, when it was discontinued through the parsimony of the parishioners.  The vestrymen of Chiswick appear to have shown either extreme precaution or else extremely aristocratic tendencies; for in <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct> (as we are told by a tablet on the wall of the church) they passed a resolution that henceforth no corpse should be interred in the vaults beneath the church unless buried in lead. 
    <P>Chiswick churchyard holds the ashes of more than a fair sprinkling of those whose names have been inscribed on the roll of the Muses, or have achieved or inherited names illustrious in history. Space will permit us to speak of only a few. Here, then, lies the <num value="3">third</num> daughter of the Protector, Oliver Cromwell, Mary, Countess of Fauconberg. She was married at Hampton Court in <datestruct value="1657--"><year reg="1657">1657</year></datestruct>, and resided at Sutton Court. In person, as we learn from   Noble's <QUOTE>Memoirs of the Cromwells</QUOTE> she is said to have been handsome, and yet to have resembled her father. In the decline of her life she grew sickly and pale, and after seeing all the hopes of her family cut off by her father's death, she is said to have exerted such   influence as she possessed for the restoration of Monarchy. She bore the character of a pious and virtuous woman, and constantly attended divine service in Chiswick Church to the day of her death. 
    <P>Here, too, were buried Lord Macartney, our  Ambassador to China, and   Ugo   Foscolo, the  Italian patriot. The tomb of the latter, restored and surmounted by a fine block of Cornish granite in <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>, at the expense of Mr. Gurney, was visited, during his stay in England, by Garibaldi, who made a pilgrimage to it, in company with M. Panizzi, at an hour when few of the good people of Chiswick were out of their beds. After reposing here for nearly half a century, the body of Ugo Foscolo was disinterred and conveyed to his native country, as is duly recorded by a recent inscription on the tomb, which is as follows:--

    <P>Ugo Foscolo's was <num value="1">one</num> of the few great names in Italian literature in the present century.   He was a native of Zante, of Venetian extraction, and was educated at Padua.   After some adventures in the army, he devoted himself to literature, and was remarkable for the terseness and polish of his Italian style. He had studied the finest and best writers of Greece and Italy down to those of the Middle Ages inclusively. Admiring Alfieri beyond all others, he imitated him in keeping as close as possible to the severe style of Dante. Coming to   England with   good introductions, he might have supported himself in comfort, had it not been for his irritable temper, which was rendered worse by pecuniary losses.   He obtained the <hi rend=italics>entree</hi> of Holland House, but took a great dislike to its mistress, saying that <QUOTE>he should be sorry to go even to heaven with Lady Holland.</QUOTE> He lived in lodgings in Wigmore Street, made the acquaintance of Rogers, Campbell, and the rest of the literary clique, and contributed to the <hi rend=italics>Quarterly</hi> and other periodicals.   He was also the author of <QUOTE>Fieste,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Ajax,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Ricciardo,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Sepulchres,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The Letters of Ortis,</QUOTE> the <QUOTE>Essay on Petrarch,</QUOTE> and <pb id="P.552" n="552"> of many other works, the merits of which can be appreciated only by Italian scholars. He died in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>.   In the year <datestruct value="1871"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>, as stated above, his remains were disinterred and carried over to his beloved Italy.   Peace to his ashes!   In spite of his rudeness to Lady Holland, he was in many ways <num value="1">one</num> of Nature's true nobility. 
   <P>Another noted individual who reposes here is Miles Corbet, the regicide, who died at the age of <num value="83">eighty-three</num>.   Then there is Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland, fairest and gayest of the fair but frail beauties of the Court of the <num value="2">second</num> Charles: this lady was the daughter of William, Viscount Grandison, and wife of Roger Palmer, Earl of Castlemaine, <num value="1">one</num> of the Palmers of Wingham, Kent, and of Dorney Court, Bucks. 
   <P>De Loutherbourg, the artist and magnetiser, of whom we have spoken in the preceding chapter;<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="545">545</num>.</NOTE>
and Dr. William Rose, critic and journalist, the translator of Sallust, and <QUOTE>a constant writer in the 
<hi rend=italics>Monthly Review</hi>,</QUOTE> both lie buried here.   Among Dr. Rose's visitors, it appears, were many, if not most, of the <hi rend=italics>literati</hi> of the day.   J. J. Rousseau 
<FIGURE id="Fig.552" n="2000.14.0207"><HEAD>Old Cottages On Back Common.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 took lodgings in Chiswick, during his brief stay in England, in order to be near him; and there is recorded in Faulkner's <QUOTE>Chelsea</QUOTE> an anecdote of another visitor of very opposite principles, Dr. Samuel Johnson, who, as we learn from Boswell, often came to Chiswick.   <num value="1">One</num> day, being invited by his host to take a stroll as far as Kew Gardens, at that time in the possession, if not in the actual occupation, of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and subsequently of the Princess Dowager and family, he replied to Rose, <QUOTE>No, sir, I will never walk in the gardens of an usurper;</QUOTE> a tolerably convincing illustration, if <num value="1">one</num> be needed, of the great lexicographer's Jacobite partialities being still unabated at a time when the crushing defeat of Culloden was still rankling in the   minds and memories of all adherents of the exiled family. 
   <P>Another distinguished man whose remains are interred here was Dr. Andrew Duck, an eminent civilian, who died at Chiswick in <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>.   He was some time Chancellor of the diocese of Bath and Wells, and afterwards Chancellor of London, and subsequently Master of the Court of Requests. In <datestruct value="1640--"><year reg="1640">1640</year></datestruct> he was elected member for Minehead in Somersetshire, and when the Civil War broke out <pb id="P.553" n="553"> he became a great sufferer for the royal cause. Among other works, Dr. Duck was the author of a book entitled <QUOTE>De Usu et Auctoritate Juris Civilis Romanorum.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Kent, the father of modern gardening, lies buried in the vault of the Cavendishes.   He was the Paxton of the last century. Horace Walpole says of him, <QUOTE>As a painter, he was below mediocrity; as an architect, he was the restorer of the science; as a gardener he was thoroughly original, and the inventor of an art which realises painting, and improves nature.   Mahomet imagined an elysium, but Kent created many.</QUOTE> He frequently declared that he caught his taste for landscape gardening from reading the picturesque descriptions of the poet Spenser. Mason, who notices his mediocrity as a painter, pays the following tribute to his excellence in the decoration of rural scenery : 
                                        <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L part=f>He felt

<FIGURE id="Fig.553" n="2000.14.0208"><HEAD>Hogarth's House.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 Kent, as may be judged from the above estimates, though a <num value="2">second</num>-rate painter, and a moderate architect, was at the same time an admirable landscape gardener.    Another worthy who reposes here is William Sharp, well-known in his day as a line-engraver, to whom   we are indebted for the reproduction of Sir Joshua Reynolds's portrait of John Hunter, considered to be <num value="1">one</num> of the finest prints in existence.      Born in the Minories in the year <datestruct value="1749"><year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>, and early trained in copying by his art the works of the old masters, he would in due time have proved himself a <num value="1">first</num>-rate artist, had he not devoted the best years of his life to the delusions and imposture of Joanna Southcott and <pb id="P.554" n="554"> the <QUOTE>prophet</QUOTE> Brothers,<NOTE>See Vol. V., pp. <num value="212">212</num>, <num value="251">251</num>.</NOTE> whose portrait he engraved in duplicate, in the full belief that when the New Jerusalem   arrived a single plate would not suffice to satisfy the demand for impressions! At the foot of each plate he added the words, <QUOTE>Fully believing this to be the man appointed by God, I engrave his likeness.-W. SHARP.</QUOTE> It is only fair to add that he maintained his belief in these delusions down to his very last hour. Besides the portraits above mentioned, Sharp's principal works include, <QUOTE>The Doctors of the Church,</QUOTE> after Guido; the <QUOTE>Head of the Saviour crowned with Thorns,</QUOTE> after Guido; and <QUOTE>St. Cecilia,</QUOTE> after Domenichino.   He also engraved the <QUOTE><num value="3">Three</num> Views of the Head of Charles I.,</QUOTE> after Vandyck; <QUOTE>The Sortie made by the Garrison of Gibraltar,</QUOTE> after Turnbull; and the <QUOTE>Siege and Relief of Gibraltar,</QUOTE> after Copley. The plate of the <QUOTE><num value="3">Three</num> Maries,</QUOTE> after Annibal Carracci, was left unfinished at the time of his decease, which took place at Chiswick in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>.   A portrait of Sharp painted by Longdale, was exhibited at the Royal Academy in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, and was purchased by the trustees of the National Portrait Gallery. 
   <P>There are also buried here Judith, Lady Thornhill, the widow of Sir James Thornhill, the painter of the ceilings of Blenheim and Greenwich,<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="180">180</num>.</NOTE> and of the dome of St. Paul's; her daughter, married to the immortal Hogarth; a sister of Hogarth; and last, not least, the great caricaturist himself, William Hogarth, to whose memory a large and conspicuous monument, erected by Garrick, stands in the churchyard, on the south side of the church, surmounted with a brazen flame like that on the top of the Monument at London Bridge.   The inscription on the tomb is as follows:--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Here lieth the body of William Hogarth, Esq., who died <datestruct VALUE="1764-10-26"><month reg="10">October</month> the <day reg=26>26th</day>, <year reg=1764>1764</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="67">67</num> years.

   <P>The inscription was written by Garrick himself. The monument is adorned also with a mask, a laurel-wreath, a palette, pencils, and a book inscribed <QUOTE>The Analysis of Beauty.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Dr. C. Mackay, in his interesting volume entitled <QUOTE>The Thames and its Tributaries,</QUOTE> from   which we have frequently quoted during the progress of this work, criticises the inscription on Hogarth's tomb in rather severe terms, remarking that <QUOTE>the object of an   epitaph   is merely   to   inform   the reader of the great or good man who rests below,</QUOTE> and that, consequently, <QUOTE>there is no necessity for the word of leave-taking.</QUOTE> He   adds, however, that <QUOTE>The thought in the last stanza   is much better; and   were   it not for the   unreasonable request that we should weep over the spot, would be   perfect in its way.   Men   cannot weep   that their predecessors have lived. We may sigh that neither virtue nor genius can escape the common lot of humanity, but no more; we cannot weep. Admiration   claims   no such homage; and, if it did, we could not pay it.</QUOTE>

   <p><emph rend=caps>Dear Sir</emph>,--I have thought upon your epitaph, but without much effect. An epitaph is no easy thing. 
   <p>Of your <num value="3">three</num> stanzas, the <num value="3">third</num> is utterly unworthy of you. The <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="3">third</num> together give no discriminative character.   If the <num value="1">first</num> alone were to stand, Hogarth would not be distinguished from   any other man of intellectual eminence.   Suppose you worked upon something like this:

             <L>Great Hogarth's honour'd dust is here.</QUOTE>

   <p>In your <num value="2">second</num> stanza, <hi rend=italics>pictured morals</hi> is a beautiful expression, which I would wish to retain; but <hi rend=italics>learn</hi> and 
<hi rend=italics>mourn</hi> cannot stand for rhymes. <hi rend=italics>Art and nature</hi> have been seen together too often. In the <num value="1">first</num> stanza is <hi rend=italics>feeling</hi>, in the <num value="2">second</num> <hi rend=italics>feel. Feeling</hi> for <hi rend=italics>tenderness</hi> or <hi rend=italics>sensibility</hi> is a word merely colloquial, of late introduction, not yet sure enough of its own existence to claim a place upon a stone. <hi rend=italics>If thou hast neither</hi> is quite prose, and prose of the familiar kind. Thus easy is it to find faults, but it is hard to make an epitaph. 
   <p>When you have reviewed it, let me see it again: you are welcome to any help that I can give, on condition that you make my compliments to Mrs. Garrick.

He was for many years an inhabitant of Strand-on-the-Green, in this parish, where he died at his own house, according to the <hi rend=italics>Craftsman</hi>, on the <datestruct VALUE="1738-08-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>. But it is always said that he was buried in St. Clement Danes.<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="30">30</num>.</NOTE>   Near him sleeps James Ralph, well known as a political writer, and a friend of Franklin. He published some poems ridiculed by Pope in the <QUOTE>Dunciad.</QUOTE> 
   <QUOTE REND=blockquote>Silence, ye wolves; while Ralph to Cynthia howls,      Making night hideous, answer him ye owls.</QUOTE>
If his poems were not good, at all events his political tracts showed great ability, and he was in high favour with Frederick, Prince of Wales. 
   <P>It is worthy of remark that the church and churchyard cover the remains of a considerable number of Roman Catholics, including, among many members of old English and Irish families, some of the Towneleys of Towneley, Mr. Chideock Wardour, &amp;c. The Towneleys, we may add, owned a house in the village on the site of the former residence of the Earls of Bedford.   In <datestruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>, and again in <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>, the churchyard was enlarged by the addition of ground at its western extremity, the gifts of successive Dukes of Devonshire, as parishioners. 
   <P>On the outside of the wall of the churchyard, on the north-east, facing the street, is the following curious inscription, which is of interest as showing the sacredness of consecrated ground <num value="2">two</num> centuries ago. It takes much the same view as that expressed at such length by Sir Henry Spelman in his book, 
<title lang=la>De non temerandis Ecclesiis</title>: <QUOTE>This wall was made at ye charges of ye right honourable and truelie pious Lorde Francis Russell, Earle of Bedford, out of true zeale and care for ye keeping of this church yard and ye wardrobe of Godd's saints, whose bodies lay (<foreign lang=la>sic</foreign>) therein buryed, from violating by swine and other prophanation.   So witnesseth  Willliam   Walker, V. A.D. <datestruct value="1623"><year reg="1623">1623</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> Beneath this inscription is a tablet setting forth that the wall was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>. 
    <P>The churchwardens' books, commencing with the year <datestruct value="1621"><year reg="1621">1621</year></datestruct>, contain a variety of curious and interesting entries. <QUOTE>Our dinner, when we went to take our oathes,</QUOTE> is a constantly recurring item; so frequent, indeed, and occasionally so costly, that on <num value="1">one</num> occasion the good vicar was scandalised, and adds a foot-note, <QUOTE>Here they eat too much.</QUOTE> Another frequent item is that of <QUOTE>Boathier</QUOTE> (hire), for parochial excursions; in <num value="1">one</num> place we read of <QUOTE>Boat-hier for to take the children to Fulham   to be Bishoped,</QUOTE> <hi rend=italics>i.e</hi>. confirmed.   We find also frequently large fees paid <QUOTE>for the buryall of creeples;</QUOTE> and in <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>-<num value="6">6</num> the books contain, 
 <hi rend=italics>inter alia</hi>, an account of the Great Plague, and of the sanitary measures adopted by the parish.  Among other curious precautions, it should be mentioned that a resolution was passed by the parish that all loose and stray dogs and cats are to be killed for fear of conveying the infection, and that the poor bedesmen are to nurse <QUOTE>the patients ill with the plague.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Then   there   are   sundry   entries   concerning <QUOTE>plague-water,</QUOTE> a supposed antidote to the plague, but which does not appear to have proved an infallible elixir, for in more than <num value="1">one</num> instance we read an entry of <QUOTE>plague-water</QUOTE> for A or B, when the next page has a charge for carrying the said A or B to church. Other sums are charged as paid to <QUOTE>maimed soldiers,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Tory ministers,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>plundered persons,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>the widow Steevens in her distraction.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1643--"><year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct> occurs a charge <QUOTE>for sweeping the church after the soldiers,</QUOTE> <hi rend=italics>i.e</hi>. after it had been occupied by the London <QUOTE>Train Bands,</QUOTE> who were quartered within its walls, and took part in the battle fought on Turnham   Green between  Prince Rupert and the Parliamentary forces. The records of fast-days, and of revels, feasts, bellringings, and tar-barrels on festive occasions paid out of the church rates-<hi rend=italics>e.g.</hi>., for <QUOTE>the victory over the Dutch</QUOTE> --show that Chiswick took an active part in the politics of the age. The books during the <num value="1">first</num> half of the last century contain several curious entries of rewards paid to the beadles for driving away out of the parish sundry poor women, who came into its aristocratic precincts in a condition which showed that they were likely to add to the population, and so to entail charges on the parishioners.   To account for the disappearance of all earlier registers, it is said, but upon what authority <pb id="P.556" n="556"> we know not, that when the Protector quartered his troops in the church, he and his soldiers tore up those documents to light the fires, and for other and viler purposes.   We may add that although there is a tradition that Lady Fauconberg got possession of her father's body at the Restoration, and deposited it carefully here; and although Miss Strickland, in <num value="1">one</num> of her biographies, mentions a report that the real child of James II. died of <QUOTE>spotted fever,</QUOTE> and was buried at Chiswick, no traces of any entry of such burials are to be found in the parish records. 
<NOTE RESP=BOLLES><LEMMA id="lemma.556.1">William Hogarth's Tomb</LEMMA></NOTE>

    <P>But Chiswick has been remarkable for other celebrated persons who have lived in it. Amongst those of whom we have not already spoken, excepting with reference to their graves in the churchyard, may be mentioned Sir Stephen Fox, the friend of Evelyn, who occupied the Manor House, now the asylum kept by Dr. Tuke; Dr. Busby, of scholastic fame; Pope, who resided for a time in Mawson's Buildings (now Mawson Row); the notorious Barbara, Duchess of Cleveland; Lord Fauconberg, the Protector's son-in-law; the Pastons, ancient Earls of Yarmouth; Sir John Chardin, the traveller; Lord Heathfield, the defender of Gibraltar; Lord Macartney, our Ambassador in   China; Hogarth, Zoffany, and Loutherbourg, the painters; Holland, the actor, and friend of Garrick; Dr. Rose, the translator of Sallust; Carey, the translator of Dante; Sharp, the engraver; and Carpue, the anatomist.   Thomas Wood, another resident of Chiswick, was immortalised by an epigram, written in Evelyn's <QUOTE>Book of Coins</QUOTE> by Pope's own hand: 
          <QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Tom Wood of Chiswick, deep divine, 
             <L>To painter Kent gave all this coin. 
             <L>&lsquo;Tis the <num value="1">first</num> coin, I'm bold to say, 
             <L>That ever churchman gave to lay.</QUOTE>

   <P>The above lines were communicated to <title>Notes and Queries</title>, <datestruct VALUE="1851-03-15"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=15>15th</day>, <year reg=1851>1851</year></datestruct>, by the Rev. R. Hotchkin, rector of Thimbleby, from a copy once in the possession of Mason, the poet. 
   <P>At a short distance north-west of the church, in a narrow and dirty lane leading towards <num value="1">one</num> entrance to the grounds of Chiswick House, still stands the red-bricked house which was once occupied by Hogarth, and still bears his name. The house is very narrow from front to back; <num value="1">one</num> end abuts on the road; but the front of it, which apparently is in much the same condition now as when Hogarth lived, looks into a closed and high-walled garden of about a quarter of an acre, in which a prominent object is a fine mulberry-tree planted by the painter's own hand. At the bottom of the garden stood till recently the workshop in which he used to ply his art, secluded and alone. Hard by against the wall were formerly memorials in stone to his favourite dog, cat, and bullfinch. That over the dog was inscribed- 
         <QUOTE REND=blockquote>Life to the last enjoyed, here Pompey lies,</QUOTE>
and on that of the bird was <QUOTE>Alas! poor Dick;</QUOTE> the memorial over the grave of the cat disappeared many years ago. The <num value="2">two</num> memorials above mentioned remained upon the grounds till quite recently, it being in the agreement when the house was let that they should not be disturbed; their position, however, had long been changed.   For some time they were covered over with concrete, to serve as the flooring of a pigsty; but in the end they were carried away, and the bones of Hogarth's <QUOTE>pets</QUOTE> were disinterred.   Hogarth's residence is now a private dwelling-house, and the garden is tenanted by a florist. <num value="2">Two</num> leaden urns which adorn the entrance to the house were the gift of David Garrick to his friend. 
    <P>Mr. Tom Taylor thus describes Hogarth's house, as it was in <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>His house still stands, but sadly degraded within the last few years. It is a snug red-brick villa of the Queen Anne style, with a garden before it of about a quarter of an acre. An old mulberry is the only tree in the neglected garden that may have borne fruit for Hogarth. There is down-stairs a good panelled sitting-room with <num value="3">three</num> windows, a small panelled hall, and a kitchen built on to the house; above, <num value="2">two</num> storeys of <num value="3">three</num> rooms each, with attics over. The principal room on the <num value="1">first</num> floor has a projecting bay-window of <num value="3">three</num> lights, quite in the style of Hogarth's time, and was no doubt added by him. The paintingroom   was over the stable at the bottom   of the garden.   Stable and room   have fallen down, but parts of the walls are still standing. The tablets to the memory of pet birds and dogs, formerly let into the garden wall, have disappeared.</QUOTE> 
   <P>It was here that Hogarth used to spend the summers of his later life, enjoying the fresh air and green fields, which in his time were more extensive than they are now, although Chiswick has been less over-built than most of the London suburbs, and still retains much of its old-world character. Besides his favourite amusement of riding, the artist used to occupy himself in painting and in superintending the engravers whom   he often invited down from London. And to his Chiswick cottage he came, after his bitter quarrel with Wilkes and Churchill, bringing some plates for re-touching. He was cheerful, but weak, and must have felt that his end was not far off, when in <datestruct VALUE="1764-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1764">1764</year></datestruct>, he put the last touches to his <QUOTE>Bathos.</QUOTE> His prints now filled a large volume; and as the story <pb id="P.557" n="557"> goes, at <num value="1">one</num> of the last dinners which he gave he was talking of a final addition to them. 
   <P>Hogarth was then not in the best of health, and in reply to <num value="1">one</num> of his guests as to what his next picture was to be, he remarked, <QUOTE>My next undertaking shall be the end of all things.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>If that is the case,</QUOTE> said <num value="1">one</num> of the party, <QUOTE>your business will be finished, for there will be an end of the painter.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>You say true,</QUOTE> said Hogarth, with a sigh; however, he began his design the next day, and worked at it till it was finished.   A strange and yet impressive grouping of objects have we there--a broken bottle, an old broom worn to the stump, the butt-end of an old musket, a cracked bell, a bow unstrung, an empty purse, a crown tumbled to pieces, towers in ruins, the sign-post of a tavern called the <QUOTE>World's End,</QUOTE> the moon in her wane, the map of fhe globe burning, a gibbet falling and the body dropping down, Phoebus and his horses dead in the clouds, a vessel wrecked, Time with his hour-glass and scythe broken, a tobacco-pipe in his mouth with the last whiff of smoke going out, a play-book opened with <hi rend=italics>Exeunt Omnes</hi> stamped in the corner. <QUOTE>So far so good,</QUOTE> cried Hogarth; <QUOTE>nothing now remains but this,</QUOTE> as he dashed into the picture the broken painter's pallet; it was his last performance. 
    <P>Passing on a few steps farther, we come to a plain house, in the garden of which stands Hogarth's portable sun-dial, duly authenticated. In the same house Hogarth's arm-chair, made of cherrywood, and seated with leather. The latter is much decayed, and <num value="1">one</num> of the arms is wormeaten, but the rest is sound and good. 
    <P>This chair, in which Hogarth used to sit and smoke his pipe, was given by the painter's widow to the present owner's grandfather, who was a martyr to the gout.   It moves very easily on primitive stone castors, <num value="3">three</num> in number. To this same individual Mrs. Hogarth offered to sell a quantity of her late husband's pictures for <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>; but the bargain was never concluded, and his paintings were eventually dispersed. 
   <P>The principal street of Chiswick is a narrow, winding thoroughfare, running at right angles from the river, close by the church. In the middle of the village is the Griffin Brewery, where, aided by the medicinal virtues of a spring of their own, Messrs. Fuller, Smith, and Turner produce ales in no way inferior to those of Bass and Allsopp; and not far distant is the brewery of Messrs. Sich and Co., a firm perhaps equally well known. 
   <P>The Mall, as we have stated above, overlooks the river, and commands beautiful and extensive views.   It commences at the vicarage, and extends eastward towards the terrace at Hammersmith, with which it forms a continuous promenade. About half-way along the Mall is an old publichouse, the <QUOTE>Red Lion,</QUOTE> which has stood upwards of a century: it is a large house, and some of the rooms and fireplaces bear evident traces of its antiquity. Chained to the lintel of the door is an old whetstone, which was placed there a few years ago, on the demolition of a still older inn which stood next door, on the spot now occupied by the new   store-rooms of the Griffin Brewery.   This older hostelry bore the sign of the <QUOTE>White Bear and Whetstone.</QUOTE> The stone itself, which has been handed over to the safe keeping of the <QUOTE>Red Lion,</QUOTE> bears the following inscription, cut upon it in deep letters :-- <QUOTE>I am the old whetstone, and have sharpened tools on this spot above <num value="1000">1,000</num> years.</QUOTE> As originally cut, the number of years was evidently ioo; the <num value="4">fourth</num> figure is clearly a more recent addition.   From the tool-sharpening operation that has been carried on, a portion of the stone is considerably worn away, and with it part of the inscription, which, we were informed by an old inhabitant, ran thus:-- <QUOTE>Whet without, wet within.</QUOTE> Of the ludicrous uses to which a whetstone may sometimes be put we have given an amusing instance in our account of Fulham Palace.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="509">509</num>.</NOTE>

    <P>A little to the east of the <QUOTE>Red Lion,</QUOTE> on the spot now   occupied by a row of modern semidetached villas, stood formerly a building called the College House, which was   originally   the prebendal manor-house of Chiswick, of which we have spoken above.   In <datestruct value="1570--"><year reg="1570">1570</year></datestruct> it was held by Dr.  Gabriel Goodman, Dean of Westminster (<num value="1">one</num> of  Fuller's <QUOTE>worthies</QUOTE> ), who granted a lease of the manor, in trust, for <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> years, to William  Watter and George Burden, that they should within <num value="2">two</num> years convey the farm to the Abbey  Church of Westminster.   In this lease it was stipulated that the lessee <QUOTE>should erect additional buildings adjoining the manor-house, sufficient for the accommodation of <num value="1">one</num> of the prebendaries of  Westminster, the master of the school, the usher, <num value="40">forty</num> boys, and proper attendants, who should retire thither in time of sickness, or at other seasons when the Dean and Chapter should think proper.</QUOTE> From that time down to a comparatively recent date a piece of ground was reserved (in the lease to the sub-lessee) as a play-place for the  Westminster scholars, although it is not known that the school was ever removed to Chiswick since the time of Dr. Busby, who resided here with some of his scholars, in <datestruct value="1657--"><year reg="1657">1657</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>on account of <pb id="P.558" n="558"> the hot and sickly season of the year.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, when the plague commenced in town, Dr. Busby removed his scholars to Chiswick.   But it spread its baneful influence even to this place. Upon this Dr. Busby called his scholars together, and in an excellent oration acquainted   them   that he had presided over the school for <num value="25">twenty-five</num> years, in which time he had never hitherto deserted Westminster; but that the exigencies of the time required it now. At the end of the last century, according to Lysons, the names of Lord Halifax and John Dryden, who were Busby's scholars, could be seen written on the walls of this interesting old house. When Hughson published his <QUOTE>History of London</QUOTE> (in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>), the old College House was occupied as an academy.   In more recent times the premises were taken by Mr. C. Whittingham, who here set up that printing-press which subsequently turned out so many beautifully-printed octavos and duodecimos, embracing nearly the whole range of English literature.   Mr. Whittingham   built for himself extensive premises at Chiswick, where he manufactured paper, the reputation of which soon spread, owing to its strength, and yet its softness. This was made principally from   old rope, by a 
<FIGURE id="Fig.558" n="2000.14.0209"><HEAD>Entrance To Chiswick.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 process of his own devising. Whittingham commenced business on a small scale in Fetter Lane, but ultimately he realised a handsome income from the <QUOTE>Chiswick Press.</QUOTE> 
   <P>The old house, which in its latter days was known as Chiswick Hall, having been disposed of, was finally demolished in <datestruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>, when the lower part of the walls, which had been embedded in stones and wood-work, was found to be of great thickness.   Some part ot the old boundary-walls are still standing. The old materials having been used in the alterations carried out in the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, there can be no doubt that the fragments found embedded in the walls were from the earlier building, and possibly of Norman origin. 
   <P>Here, probably at Walpole House, on the Mall, Barbara, Duchess of Cleveland, spent the last few years of her life. Here, in the summer of <datestruct value="1709--"><year reg="1709">1709</year></datestruct>, says Boyer, she <QUOTE>fell ill of a dropsie what swelled her gradually to a monstrous bulk, and in about <num value="3">three</num> months put a period to her life, in the sixtyninth year of her age.</QUOTE> She died <datestruct VALUE="-10-9"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=9>9th</day></datestruct>, in the year above mentioned, and was buried in the chancel of the parish church, though no stone marks the spot.

At Walpole House Daniel O&lsquo;Connell resided for several years while he was studying for the law. 
    <P>In Chiswick Lane, the road leading from the  Mall up to the Kew and London Road, lived  Dr. Rose, a pupil of Doddridge, and a schoolmaster of repute. He kept an academy at Kew, where Dr. Johnson came to take tea. Sometimes  Rose would be unavoidably absent, and Johnson drank cup after cup, condescending to say little to Mrs. R., as she tells us, except, <QUOTE>Madam, I am afraid I give you a great deal of trouble.</QUOTE> Dr.  Rose, as we have stated above, lies buried in the neighbouring churchyard. 
   <P>Another resident was Dr. Ralph, a political writer and historian, who appears in Bubb Dodington's Diary to have been long in the confidence and service of the clique at Leicester House.<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="164">164</num>.</NOTE>

   <P>In <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct> the quiet village was frighted from its propriety by the arrival of the celebrated Rousseau, who took lodgings at a small grocer's shop near the house of Dr. Rose. <QUOTE>He sits in the shop,</QUOTE> says a writer in the Caldwell papers, <QUOTE>and learns English words, which brings many customers to the shop.</QUOTE> At <num value="1">one</num> time Edward Moore, the journalist, lived here.

Moore at once remarked, <QUOTE>Well, my dear, that's very odd, for I was thinking the whole time of the  <Q>next <title>World</title>.</Q> </QUOTE> 
   <P>On the west side of Chiswick Lane is Mawson Row-formerly called Mawson's Buildings--a row of red-brick houses, <num value="5">five</num> in number.   Alexander Pope and his father lived here for a short time. They removed thither early in <datestruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>, from Binfield, the place of the poet's birth; and left Chiswick for the more famous residence at Twickenham about the year <datestruct value="1719"><year reg="1719">1719</year></datestruct>.   The elder Pope, who died here in <datestruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct>, lies buried in Chiswick churchyard. Portions of the original drafts of the translation of the <QUOTE>Iliad,</QUOTE> on which Pope was engaged at this period, and which are preserved in the British Museum, are written upon the backs of letters to Pope and his father, addressed, <QUOTE>To Alexr. Pope,  Esquire, at Mawson's Buildings, in Chiswick.</QUOTE> Among the writers of these letters appear to be  Lord Harcourt, and Teresa Blount. 
    <P>Higher up Chiswick Lane stands the old Manor  House, which was once inhabited by the lords of the manor, and has all the imposing exterior of a  French <hi rend=italics>chateau</hi>. It is now a private lunatic asylum.  At the junction of the lane with the high road is Grosvenor House, an old-fashioned mansion, which, since <datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>, has been occupied as St. Agnes'  Orphanage for Girls. 
    <P>At a short distance westward from   Chiswick  Lane lies the hamlet of Turnham   Green, which connects the parish of Hammersmith with that of  Chiswick, to which it belongs. The green abuts upon the main road, and is enclosed; and in the centre stands a church of Early-English architecture, which was erected in <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>, when the hamlet was made into an ecclesiastical district. 
    <P>Without going back to mythical times,--to speak of a certain battle which is stated to have been fought here in the British or Saxon times, and without inferring, as does Stukeley, that it was a  Roman station simply because an urn of Roman manufacture was dug up here during the reign of  George I., we may state that Turnham Green in its time has been the scene of sundry historic events. Here, in <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>, Prince Rupert encamped with his army; and on the day of the <QUOTE>Battle of  Brentford</QUOTE> the green witnessed some sharp skirmishing, no less than <num value="600">six hundred</num> of the prince's cavaliers being left dead on   the field.   The  Royalists--headed by Prince Rupert, and followed by King Charles-after leaving Oxford, and making their way through Abingdon, Henley, and other towns, had reached as far as Brentford, which was occupied by a broken regiment of Colonel Hollis's, but <QUOTE>stout men all, who had before done good service at Edgehill.</QUOTE> The Royalists, it appears, fancied that they should cut their way through  Brentford without any difficulty, go on to Hammersmith, where the Parliament's train of artillery lay, and then take London by a night assault.   But  Hollis's men opposed their passage, and stopped their march so long at Brentford that the regiments of Hampden and Lord Brooke had time to come up. These <num value="3">three</num> regiments, not without great loss, completely barred the road. The Earl of Essex, having quartered his army at Acton, had ridden to Westminster to give the Parliament an account of his campaign, and while he was absent, Prince  Rupert, taking advantage of a dense November fog, had advanced, and fallen unexpectedly upon the Roundheads.   The roar of the artillery was heard in the House of Lords, and the Earl of Essex <pb id="P.561" n="561"> rushed out of the house, mounted his horse, and galloped across the parks in the direction of the ominous sound.   As he approached Brentford, the earl learned, to his astonishment, the trick which had been played; he had gathered a considerable force of horse as he rode along, and when he came to the spot he found that the Royalists had given over the attack and were lying quietly on the western side of Brentford. <QUOTE>All that night,</QUOTE> says May, <QUOTE>the city of London poured out men towards Brentford, who, every hour, marched thither; and all the lords and gentlemen that belonged to the Parliament army were there ready by Sunday morning, the <datestruct VALUE="-11-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>.</QUOTE> Essex found himself, in the course of this Sunday, at the head of <num value="24000">24,000</num> men, who were drawn up in battle array on Turnham   Green. How the Royalists took themselves off again to Oxford, by way of Kingston Bridge, is recorded in history; and how the Earl of Essex went in pursuit, crossing over the Thames by a bridge of boats from Fulham to Putney, we have already told.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="502">502</num>.</NOTE>

   <P>Turnham Green was to have been the scene of the Jacobite plot to assassinate William III. on the <datestruct VALUE="1696-02-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1696">1696</year></datestruct>, as recorded by Macaulay in the <num value="21">21st</num> chapter of his history. <QUOTE>The place,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE>was to be a narrow and winding lane leading from the landing-place on the north of the river to Turnham Green. The spot may still easily be found, though the ground has since been drained by trenches.

The spot is still easily identified. In his <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> under date <datestruct VALUE="1852-05-1"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=1>1st</day>, <year reg=1852>1852</year></datestruct>, Macaulay has an entry: <QUOTE>After breakfast I went to Turnham Green to look at the place. I found it after some search: the very spot beyond a doubt, and admirably suited for an assassination.</QUOTE> 
   <P>A pamphlet, published in <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>, furnishes details of another sanguinary encounter, on a smaller scale, which took place here; the pamphlet is entitled <QUOTE>Great and Bloody News from Turnham Green, or a Relation of a sharp Encounter between the Earl of Pembroke and his Company with the Constable and Watch belonging to the parish of Chiswick, in which conflict <num value="1">one</num> Mr. Smeethe, a gentleman, and <num value="1">one</num> Mr. Halfpenny, a constable, were mortally wounded.</QUOTE> 
    <P>In <datestruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct>, Mr. Alderman Sawbridge, then Lord Mayor, met with a mishap here.   Crossing the green, on his way back from a state visit to royalty at Kew, his carriage and suite were stopped by a single highwayman; even the City <QUOTE>sword-bearer</QUOTE> sat still and submitted to see himself and the chief civic dignitary stripped of their valuables. It is said that when the highwayman had thus outraged the City magnates, he rode off towards Kew, and meeting the vicar on the way, made him deliver up his valuables, and among other things his written sermon! 
   <P>But. even Turnham   Green has its amusing memories. Angelo, in his <QUOTE>Reminiscences,</QUOTE> tells a good story, the scene of which he lays here. <QUOTE>Returning <num value="1">one</num> day from my professional attendance in the country, when I reached Turnham Green I met a happy pair, as I imagined, who were taking a trip from town to pass their honeymoon in the country.   They happened, however, to have a quarrel just as a return post-chaise passed by, a little in front of me; the postilion was stopped by the gentleman; and as I stopped also I beheld the gentleman hand the young lady out of the coach and place her in the chaise, singing at the same time the words of an old favourite Vauxhall song,  <Q>How   sweet the love that meets return!</Q>  It is said that  <Q>a fool and his money are soon parted;</Q>  in this case it may be suggested that for  <Q>money</Q>  we should read  <Q> bride.</Q> </QUOTE> 
   <P>Like its neighbour Hammersmith, Turnham Green has numbered among its residents a few men of note in their day; among them, Lord Lovat, the Scottish rebel, and the hero of Gibraltar, Sir George Eliott, Lord Heathfield. 
   <P>The old <QUOTE>Pack Horse</QUOTE> has been a well-known tavern at Turnham Green for a couple of centuries; it is mentioned in an advertisement in the <hi rend=italics>London Gazette</hi> as far back as the year <datestruct value="1697"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>.   Here Horace Walpole used often to bait his horse when journeying between London   and his favourite Strawberry Hill.   The <QUOTE>Pack Horse,</QUOTE> as Mr. Larwood tells us, in his <QUOTE>History of Sign-boards,</QUOTE> was a common sign for posting inns in former times: and it certainly points back to a very primitive mode of travelling.

    <P>The locality of Turnham Green has long been famous for its gardens and nurseries. Almost the very last entry in John Evelyn's <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> relates to <pb id="P.562" n="562"> this place; he writes, under date <datestruct VALUE="1705-05-18"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=18>18</day>, <year reg=1705>1705</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>I went to see Sir John Chardine at Turnham   Green;   the gardens being very fine and   well planted with fruit.</QUOTE> 
     <P>Mr. Glendinning's nursery here has long been in existence as the Chiswick Nursery, and it is said   that heaths   were cultivated   here   almost earlier than in any of the metropolitan establishments of this kind.   Of late years this nursery has greatly risen in character, and is still constantly improving.      New   houses have been erected, a wider range of plant-culture has been taken, and a considerable interest is made to attach to it on account of the spirit and enterprise with which new plants are procured, and the successful manner in which they are flowered. 
    <P>The following epitaph on Jemmy Armstrong, a sheriff's officer, who died in <datestruct VALUE="1801-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct>, at his villa on Turnham   Green, commonly known by the name of <QUOTE>Lock--up Hall,</QUOTE> will be found in <QUOTE>The Spirit of the Public Journals</QUOTE> for <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct> :--

    <P>From Turnham   Green, a broad road lined with lime-trees, and known as the Duke's New Roadfrom the fact of its having been made by the late  Duke of Devonshire-leads to Chiswick House, <num value="1">one</num> of the many seats of his Grace. In the <num value="9">ninth</num> year of King Edward IV., <num value="1">one</num> Baldwin Bray, whose   ancestors   were   settled   here   for many generations, conveyed the lease of the <QUOTE>manor of  Sutton within Cheswyke</QUOTE> to Thomas Coveton and others; and during the civil war this manor was sequestered to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of  London.   In <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct> the lease came into the hands of Thomas, Earl of Fauconberg, whose son's greatnephew, Thomas Fowler, Viscount Fauconberg, assigned it about the year <datestruct value="1727"><year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct> to Richard, Earl of Burlington.   After the Earl's death, the lease was renewed to the Duke of Devonshire, who married his daughter and sole heir. The other, or prebendal manor, is still in the hands of the  Weatherstone family. 
   <P>The mansion stands near the site of an old house, which, it is said, was built by Sir Edward Warden, or Wardour, but which was pulled down in <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>, and by Kip's print of it seems to have been of the date of James I. Towards the latter end of that king's reign, it certainly was the property and residence of Robert Carr, Earl of    Somerset, whose abandoned Countess died there in misery and disgrace. The Earl, who was a partaker in her crimes, survived her many years, but was never able to retrieve his broken fortunes and dishonoured name. On the marriage of his daughter, Lady Ann, with Lord Russell,* he was obliged to mortgage his house at Chiswick to make up the marriage portion which the Earl of    Bedford demanded with his wife, and the mortgage never being paid off, the estate passed away into other hands, from whom again it passed through several changes into the possession of Boyle, Earl of Burlington, above mentioned.   Faulkner, in his <QUOTE>History of Chiswick,</QUOTE> remarks that <QUOTE>it is a curious fact that though Chiswick was sold by the beautiful Lady Ann Carr's father, to enable her to marry, it was not lost to her descendants; for    Rachel, the daughter of Lord Russell who was beheaded, and his celebrated wife, married the <num value="2">second</num> Duke of Devonshire, so that the present duke is descended from that lovely girl, and is a possessor of the place where her youth was spent--the home of her ancestors.</QUOTE> <NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="538">538</num>.</NOTE>

     <P>The house, which is almost hidden from   our view by the tall cedars and other trees among which it stands embowered, was erected by the last Earl of Burlington--the <QUOTE>architect earl,</QUOTE> as he is called--in the reign of George II., from a design by Palladio; and it is a standing proof of the skill and taste of the noble designer, though its merits have been variously estimated. 
     <P>The ascent to the house is by a double flight of steps, on <num value="1">one</num> side of which is the statue of Palladio, on the other that of Inigo Jones. The portico is supported by <num value="6">six</num> fluted columns, of the Corinthian order, surmounted by a pediment; the cornice, frieze, and architraves being as rich as possible.   Inside this is an octagonal saloon, which finishes at the top in a dome, through which it is lighted.   The interior of the structure is finished with the utmost elegance; the ceilings and mouldings are richly gilt, upon a white ground, giving a chaste air to the whole interior.   The principal rooms are embellished with books, splendidly bound, and so arranged as to appear not an encumbrance but ornament. The tops of the book-cases are covered with white marble, edged with gilt borders. 
    <P>The gardens are laid out in the <num value="1">first</num> taste, the vistas terminated by a temple, obelisk, or some similar ornament, so as to produce the most agreeable effect. At the end opposite the house are <num value="2">two</num> wolves by Scheemakers; the other exhibits a <pb id="P.563" n="563"> large lioness and a goat. The view is terminated by <num value="3">three</num> fine antique statues, dug up in Adrian's garden at Rome, with stone seats between them. Along the ornamental waters we are led to an inclosure, where are a Roman temple and an obelisk; and on its banks stands an exact model of the portico of St. Paul's, Covent Garden, the work of Inigo Jones.   The pleasure-grounds and park include about <num value="90">ninety</num> acres, together with an orangery, conservatory, and range of forcinghouses <num value="300">300</num> feet in length. 
    <P>Horace Walpole, being a <hi rend=italics>connoisseur</hi>, must needs find fault with something. He desired that the lavish quantity of urns and statues behind the garden front should be <QUOTE>retrenched;</QUOTE> and this might be desirable if these urns and statues were not exquisite gems of art, and individually of great beauty and value, demanding a more undivided attention than would be given them if considered merely as ornamental appendages to the grounds. The bronze statues of the Gladiator, Hercules with his club, and the Faun, are worthy a place in any gallery. <num value="3">Three</num> colossal statues, removed hither from Rome, although mutilated, are very fine, as are also the profusion of minor marbles scattered throughout the grounds. Nothing can be more exquisite than the taste that presides over the Versailles in little.   The lofty walls of clipped yew, inclosing alleys terminated by rustic temples; the formal flower-garden, with walks converging towards a common centre, where a marble copy of the Medicean Venus woos you from the summit of a graceful Doric column; the labyrinthic involution of the walks, artfully avoiding the limits of the demesne, and deceiving you as to its real extent; the artificial water, with its light and elegant bridge, gaily painted barges, and wildfowl disporting themselves on its glassy surface; the magnificent cedars feathering to the ground; the temples and obelisk, happily situate on the banks of the river, or embowered in wildernesses of wood; the breaks of landscapes, where no object is admitted but such as the eye delights to dwell upon; the moving panorama of the Thames removed to that happy distance where the objects on its surface glide along like shadow the absolute seclusion of the scene, almost within the hum of a great city, make this seat of the Duke of Devonshire a little earthly paradise. The house, notwithstanding Lord Hervey's sarcasm (who said that it was <QUOTE>too small to inhabit, and too large to hang to <num value="1">one</num>'s watch</QUOTE> ), is a worthy monument of the genius and taste of the noble architect. Nowhere in the vicinity of London have wealth and judginent been so happily united; nowhere in the neighbourhood of the metropolis have we so complete an example of the capabilities of the Italian or classic style of landscape gardening. 
   <P><num value="1">One</num> of the principal objects of interest in the garden is an arched gateway, designed by Inigo Jones, which was originally erected at Chelsea, on the premises which once belonged to the great Sir Thomas More, but were afterwards known as Beaufort House,<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="53">53</num>.</NOTE> from   being occupied   by   the head   of that family.   The   gate   subsequently belonged to Sir Hans Sloane, but as he neglected it Lord Burlington begged it from   him.   Its removal hither occasioned the following lines by Pope : 
        <QUOTE REND=blockquote><sp><speaker>Passenger.</speaker><L><num value="0">0</num> gate! how cam'st thou here? 
           <sp><speaker>Gate.</speaker><L>I was brought from Chelsea last year 
        <L>Batter'd with wind and weather;

        <L>Sir Hans Sloane 
        <L>Let me alone, 
        <L>So Burlington brought me hither.</QUOTE>

    <P>Again, it will be remembered that in his poem on <QUOTE>Liberty</QUOTE> Thomson thus apostrophizes Lord Burlington : 
      <QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=stanza><L>Lo    numerous domes a Burlington confess:

        <L>The temple, breathing a religious awe;

        <L>And such as form a Richmond, Chiswick, Stowe.</QUOTE>

    <P>Dr. Waagen, who visited Chiswick House for the special purpose of art criticism, reports in his <QUOTE>Works of Art and Artists in England,</QUOTE> that <QUOTE>among the pictures are many good and many even excellent, but that, unfortunately, they are partly in a bad condition, either from the want of cleaning or from dryness. Several pictures, too,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>are hung in an unfavourable light, so that no decided opinion can be formed of them.</QUOTE> Among the pictures are several of Vandyke, Gaspar  Poussin, Paul Veronese, Titian, Tintoretto, C.  Maratti, Sir Godfrey Kneller, Cornelius Jansen,  Holbein, &amp;c., and <num value="1">one</num> very exquisite miniature portrait of Edward VI., after Holbein, by Peter  Oliver, son of Isaac Oliver, <num value="1">one</num> of the favourite painters of Charles I. Perhaps the finest of all the paintings is <num value="1">one</num> of Charles I. and his children, by Vandyke, as to which it is uncertain whether it is a duplicate or the original of the picture in Her  Majesty's collection at Windsor.   Another <pb id="P.564" n="564"> celebrated picture is by J. Van Eyck, which Horace Walpole mentions in his book on painting in England- <QUOTE>The Virgin and Child attended by Angels,</QUOTE> as representing in the figures which it contains several members of Lord Clifford's family (from whom   the Earl of Burlington was maternally descended); though the statement was controverted at considerable length by an eminent antiquary and genealogist in the <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi> for <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>. 
   <P>Among the other articles of <hi rend=italics>vertu</hi> in Chiswick House is a present from   the late Emperor of Russia to the late Duke of Devonshire; a magnificent clock in a case of malachite, surmounted with a representation of the Emperor, Peter the Great, in a storm, who is standing in a boat, with his hand upon the helm, in a firm and defiant attitude. The boat itself, which is about a foot long, is of bronze. 
   <P>The grounds of Chiswick House were considerably enlarged by the late Duke of Devonshire. In Miss Berry's <QUOTE>Journal,</QUOTE> under date of <datestruct VALUE="1813-06-1"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=1>1st</day>, <year reg=1813>1813</year></datestruct>, is the following entry respecting them:--

 <QUOTE>Drove with the Duke of Devonshire, in his curricle, to Chiswick, where he showed me all the alterations that he was about to make, in adding the gardens of Lady M. Coke's house to his own.

 Queen Victoria, and other sovereigns and illustrious persons to the head of the ducal house of Cavendish. 
   <P>Chiswick has witnessed the death of more than <num value="1">one</num> political celebrity. At the end of <datestruct VALUE="1806-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, the great statesman, Charles James Fox, was in his last illness removed to the Duke of Devonshire's villa, where he died a fortnight later. The bed-chamber which he occupied opens into the Italian saloon, and before the window grew a mountain-ash, which appears to have been to him an object of great interest. 
   <P>The following anecdotes rest upon the authority of Samuel Rogers :-- <QUOTE>Very shortly before Fox died he complained of great uneasiness in his stomach, and Clive advised him to try a cup of coffee. It was accordingly ordered; but not being brought as soon as was expected, Mrs. Fox expressed some impatience; upon which Fox said, with his usual sweet smile,  <Q>Remember, my dear, that good coffee cannot be made in a moment.</Q>    Lady Holland announced the death of Fox in her own odd manner to those relatives and intimate friends of his who were sitting in a room near his bedchamber, and waiting to hear he had breathed his <pb id="P.566" n="566"> last: she walked through the room with her apron over her head. * * *   How fondly the surviving friends of Fox cherished his memory! Many years after his death, I was at a <hi rend=italics>fete</hi> given by the Duke of Devonshire at Chiswick House. Sir Robert Adair and I wandered about the apartments up and down stairs.    <Q>In   which room   did Fox expire?</Q>  asked Adair. I replied,  <Q>In this very room!</Q>  Immediately Adair burst into tears with a vehemence of grief such as I hardly ever saw exhibited by a man.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Undoubtedly, Fox was a great orator. Horace Walpole wrote:-- <QUOTE>Fox had not the ungraceful hesitation of his father, yet scarcely equalled him in subtlety and acuteness.   But no man ever excelled him in the clearness of argument, which flowed from him in a torrent of vehemence, as declamation sometimes does from those who want argument.</QUOTE> Burke once called him <QUOTE>the greatest debater the world ever saw;</QUOTE> and Mackintosh described him as <QUOTE>the most Demosthenean speaker since Demosthenes.</QUOTE> 
   <P><num value="20">Twenty</num> years afterwards there came hither to die, in the same villa and the same room, and nearly at the same age, the classic and witty and brilliant George Canning. He died on the <datestruct VALUE="1827-08-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>. The apartment in which the <num value="2">two</num> statesmen breathed their last is thus sketched by Sir Henry Bulwer (Lord Dalling), in his <QUOTE>Historical Characters</QUOTE> :-- <QUOTE>It is a   small low   chamber, over a kind of nursery, and opening into a wing of the building, which gives it the appearance of looking into a court-yard.   Nothing can be more simple than its furniture or its decorations. On <num value="1">one</num> side of the fire-place are a few bookshelves; opposite the foot of the bed is the low chimney-piece, and on it a small bronze clock, to which we may fancy the weary and impatient sufferer often turned his eyes during those bitter moments in which he was passing from the world which he had filled with his name and was governing with his projects.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Of late years Chiswick House has been used as a suburban nursery for the children of the Prince and Princess of Wales; and occasionally, during the summer season, the Prince and Princess have taken up their residence here, and given gardenparties, which have perhaps even excelled in brilliancy those given in former years. 
    <P>Corney House, which was pulled down in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, originally belonged to the Russell family, who were seated here at the commencement of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century.   In <datestruct value="1602--"><year reg="1602">1602</year></datestruct> Queen Elizabeth paid a visit to its then owner, William, Lord Russell, whose son Francis, <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Bedford, afterwards lived here, and took an interest in the concerns of the parish, as is evident from the inscription on the churchyard wall already mentioned.<NOTE>See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="555">555</num> </NOTE>   The house was for some time the residence of the Earl Macartney; but, like most of the property in the immediate neighbourhood of Chiswick House, it has passed into the hands of the Duke of Devonshire. On the demolition of the mansion the grounds were added to those of Chiswick House; its name, however, is preserved in Corney Reach, a bend of the river between Chiswick and Mortlake Bridge, which has become familiarized in aquatic annals in connection with the University boat-race. 
    <P>It appears by the Court Rolls that Sir Stephen  Fox, in the year   <datestruct value="1685"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>, purchased a copyhold estate at Chiswick, on which he built a mansion, which he made his principal residence after he had retired from public business.   William III. was so pleased with it that he is said to have exclaimed to the Earl of Portland on his <num value="1">first</num> visit, <QUOTE>This place is perfectly fine; I could live here <num value="5">five</num> days</QUOTE> --a compliment which he never paid to any other place in England except Lord Exeter's mansion at Burleigh. The staircase of Sir Stephen Fox's house was painted by Verrio. The gardens, as we learn from Evelyn's <QUOTE>Diary</QUOTE> (<datestruct VALUE="1682-10-30"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=30>30th</day>, <year reg=1682>1682</year></datestruct>), were laid out by the architect, whose name was May:-- <QUOTE>The garden much too narrow; the place without water, neere a highway and neere another greate house of my Lord Burlington; with little land about it, so that I wonder at the expense; but women,</QUOTE> he quaintly adds, <QUOTE>will have their will.</QUOTE> Sir Stephen Fox, who died in <datestruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>, was the father of Henry, <num value="1">first</num> Lord Holland, and grandfather of   Charles James Fox. 
     <P>In <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, the gardens of the Horticultural Society were established on that part of the grounds of  Chiswick House lying between the mansion and  Turnham   Green. Up to this time, few of the inhabitants of London even visited the village; but when the Horticultural Fetes were held here  Chiswick achieved some notoriety: it rose to be a place of popular resort, and had even its steamboat pier. 
    <P>Other attractions, however, sprang up and threw  Chiswick into the shade; and when, as we have stated in a previous volume,<NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="116">116</num>.</NOTE> the head-quarters of the Horticultural Society were removed to South  Kensington, the visitors to Chiswick became <QUOTE>few and far between,</QUOTE> with the solitary exception of the day of the University boat-race, when the  Chiswick bank of the Thames annually receives its moiety of eager and expectant sight-seers. <pb id="P.567" n="567"> 
   <P>The Horticultural Society's grounds are now used as nursery and fruit gardens, for the culture of the seeds and rare plants collected by the society from all parts of the world; as a school of horticulture; and for raising plants and flowers for the conservatory and gardens at South Kensington, and for distribution among the Fellows of the Society. The number of plants transferred from Chiswick to South Kensington up to <datestruct VALUE="1878-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1878">1878</year></datestruct>, was nearly <num value="50000">50,000</num>.

 <P>We have now journeyed together--it is to be hoped pleasantly, and not wholly without profitfor <num value="6">six</num> years, traversing <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> the highways and byways of the metropolis, but always, as we promised, within sight of the cross and ball of St.  Paul's Cathedral-objects which, from <num value="1">first</num> to last, we have kept steadily in view. We have, nevertheless, rambled over several <num value="100">hundred</num> miles of ground--from Highgate and Hornsey in the north to Norwood and Streatham in the south, and from the river Lea in the east to Chiswick in the far west; and covering altogether an area upwards of <num value="100">one hundred</num> square miles in extent. It will, however, be our duty, before we actually part company, to take our stand as it were upon the vantageground of some breezy height, and to give our readers a general view of the vast city which we have traversed in detail, and on which we may be supposed to be looking down: our view extending, in the happy and epigrammatic words of Mr. G.  A. Sala, over a sort of panorama- <QUOTE>from where the town begins to where it ends; from the marshy flats below Deptford to the twinkling lights of  Putney and Kew.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Standing, then, in this exalted (mental) position, and surveying the expanse before us, we see at our feet London, to use the phrase of the Brothers Percy, <QUOTE>stretching out its arms, like a <num value="2">second</num> Briareus, in every direction,</QUOTE> swallowing up all the villas in our environs, and making them gradually part and parcel of the capital.   In order, however, to make our general view of London at all permanently interesting and useful, it will be desirable here to add a few generalisations, based on recent Parliamentary returns and other statistics. 
   <P><num value="1">First</num>, then, according to a recent estimate, the total length of the streets of London is about <num value="2500">2,500</num> miles; whilst the entire number of houses- <QUOTE>inhabited, uninhabited, and building</QUOTE> --concentrated, at the time of taking the census of <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>, within the area of <QUOTE>London according to Act of Parliament,</QUOTE> amounted to rather more than <num value="455000">455,000</num>; so that, adding the average annual rate of domiciliary increase (<num value="7500">7,500</num>), there must now be some <num value="52500">52,500</num> more, or <num value="507500">507,500</num> dwellings altogether.   It has been calculated that this large number of houses, with an average frontage of <num value="5">five</num> yards, would be more than sufficient to form <num value="1">one</num> continuous row of buildings round the island of Great Britain, from the Land's End to John o <QUOTE>Groat's, from   John o</QUOTE> Groat's to the North Foreland, and from the North Foreland back again to the Land's End, or <num value="1460">1,460</num> miles altogether. 
    <P>When we look at the great metropolis from an antiquarian point of view, there is much to interest in its gradual growth.   Not to speak of the City proper, which, as a matter of fact, has for centuries been almost stationary, we may gain a general idea of the outlying districts of London under King Henry VIII. from some expressions in an Act of Parliament passed in the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> year of his reign, and which regulates the extent of jurisdiction given to the wardens of certain City companies with respect to the control of apprentices. Under this Act certain rights were given to these gentlemen <QUOTE>within <num value="2">two</num> miles of the City, namely, within the town of Westminster, the parishes of St. Martinin-the-Fields, Our Lady in the Strand, St. Clement's Danes without Temple Bar, St. Giles'-in-the-Fields, St. Andrew's, Holborn; the town and borough of Southwark, Shoreditch, Whitechapel parish, Clerkenwell parish, St. Botolph without Aldgate, St. Catharine's, near the Tower, and Bermondsey Street.</QUOTE> Most of these suburbs had no point of <pb id="P.568" n="568"> contact with the City, and few had any contact with each other or any continuous buildings. Both St. Giles' and St. Martin's parishes were then literally <QUOTE>in the Fields,</QUOTE> as, indeed, was St. Andrew's, in Holborn; Marylebone and Islington are not even mentioned; while Westminster, Clerkenwell, Shoreditch, Whitechapel, and the Strand consisted entirely of mansions of the nobility, standing in their own gardens. 
    <P>The suburbs, therefore, in the reign of which we speak, must have been nearly void of buildings.  From the map of Ralph Aggas, published about the year <datestruct value="1560"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>, it appears that almost the whole of the metropolis was confined, even at that time, nearly half a century later, within the City walls.  Certainly a few straggling houses fringed <num value="1">one</num> side of the Strand, and a few more stood round about  Smithfield. Open fields were under grass close to the City walls throughout almost its whole northern circumference; while those houses which stood within them were for the most part detached and accommodated with gardens. The village of St.  Giles's lay entirely isolated across the open country.  A single street led up Holborn, almost as far as  Chancery Lane; between that point and Somerset  House the space was entirely occupied by fields and gardens. There were also many gardens and open spaces within the City itself, and more particularly along the wall, within which a considerable space was kept clear round the whole circuit, like the Pomerium of ancient Rome. The largest area occupied by gardens was immediately behind Lothbury. In the eastern and south-eastern parts of the City a great many spots were similarly appropriated. And yet, within this very limited compass of inhabited ground was crowded a population of constant dwellers, amounting to not less than  <num value="130000">130,000</num>, or perhaps more than twice the number of those who regularly sleep within the same area at the present time. 
    <P>Carefully, however, as its successive changes may be described, it is hardly possible for words to convey so clear and definite an impression of the alterations which have from time to time been made in our metropolis as may be gained from the inspection of an old map of London and comparing it with <num value="1">one</num> of the present day. Thus, for instance, in a map issued between <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1690--"><year reg="1690">1690</year></datestruct>, the Thames is invested with an unusual degree of importance, and from the number of landing-places and stairs marked down it is evident that the Londoners of that day must have been very fond of the water, and must, moreover, have spent much time upon it. Berkeley House, Albemarle House, and Burlington House stood in the green fields, which have since been covered over with dwelling-places and christened Piccadilly.   Near <QUOTE>So Ho</QUOTE> we find <QUOTE>the road to Oxford,</QUOTE> and hard by <QUOTE>the road to   Hampstead</QUOTE> is indicated. The former of these is now styled Oxford Street, and the other Tottenham Court Road. Bloomsbury had in it a few houses, while Clerkenwell was the residence of various dukes, earls, and others of the nobility. 
    <P>Passing on a few years further, Lord Macaulay observes, in his <QUOTE>History of England,</QUOTE> that <QUOTE>whoever examines the maps of London which were published towards the close of the reign of Charles II. will see that only the nucleus of the present capital then existed.   The town did not, as now, fade by imperceptible degrees into the country. No long avenues of villas, embowered in lilacs and laburnums, extended from   the great centre of wealth and civilisation almost to the boundaries of  Middlesex and far into the heart of Kent and  Surrey. In the east, no part of the immense line of warehouses and artificial lakes which now stretches from the Tower to Blackwall had even been projected.   On the west, scarcely <num value="1">one</num> of those stately piles of building which are inhabited by the noble and wealthy was in existence; and  Chelsea, which is now peopled by more than <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> human beings, was a quiet country village, with about a <num value="1000">thousand</num> inhabitants. On the north, cattle fed and sportsmen wandered with dogs and guns over the site of the borough of Marylebone, and over far the greater part of the space now covered by the boroughs of Finsbury and of the  Tower Hamlets. Islington was almost a solitude; and poets loved to contrast its silence and repose with the din and turmoil of the monster London.  On the south, the capital is now connected with its suburb by several bridges, not inferior in magnificence and solidity to the noblest works of the  Caesars. In <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct> a single line of irregular arches, overhung by piles of mean and crazy houses, and garnished, after a fashion worthy of the naked barbarians of Dahomy, with scores of mouldering heads, impeded the navigation of the river.</QUOTE> 
    <P>We pass on to the London of Queen Anne's reign, and find that its expansion, though considerable, had not been very rapid during that half century. <QUOTE>A New Map of the Cityes of London,  Westminster, and the Borough of Southwark, together with the Suburbs, as they are now standing,</QUOTE> was issued in <datestruct value="1707--"><year reg="1707">1707</year></datestruct>. What the suburbs were at that date may be judged from the fact that the map extends only from Haberdashers' Hospital, Hoxton, on the north, to St. Mary Magdalen's, Bermondsey, on the south; and from Stepney on the east to Buckingham House on the west; the City wall, with its <pb id="P.569" n="569"> gates, being duly indicated. From a note we learn that the spot now known as the <num value="7">Seven</num> Dials was then called <QUOTE>Cock and Pye-fields.</QUOTE> In another map, published about <datestruct value="1600--"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>, a note is made respecting <QUOTE>the prodigious increase of building and other alterations of ye Names and Situation of Street, etc., in this last Sentry (century).</QUOTE> Here, too, the City wall is very carefully shown, and the several gates are marked, the quaintness of the spelling being most interesting and even amusing; as, for instance, where just outside the boundary, near <QUOTE>All Gate,</QUOTE> is marked <QUOTE>Ye Goounefownders hs.</QUOTE> The Gun-founder's house), its character being indicated by the presence of a cannon within the enclosure.   In <num value="1">one</num> point, however, this map may serve to show that our forefathers were wiser than ourselves; for ample provision seems to have been made for open-air sports, and the fields which stretched out on all hands furnished the young citizens with as much room as they could well require for the development of any <QUOTE>muscular</QUOTE> theories which may then have been in vogue. 
  <P>Under the <num value="4">four</num> Georges, however, more rapid strides were made in the gradual extension of the metropolis, the erection of new houses being no longer prohibited by jealous legislation, and free trade being established in building for the necescities of the growing population.   The great increase in our national manufactures and commerce which followed the establishment of peace, in <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, brought a large access to the population of London, and these persons required to be accommodated with houses near the scene of their daily labours.   Hence Islington, and Kensington, and South Lambeth, and Hackney, and Dalston were each doubled in population and in houses; and the introduction of railways in the <num value="2">second</num> and <num value="3">third</num> quarters of the present century   has more   than   doubled   the entire London over which George III. was king. 
  <P>The population of London and its suburbs was calculated by Sir William Petty, in <datestruct value="1687--"><year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct>, to be   <num value="696000">696,000</num>; Gregory King, in <datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>, by the hearthmoney, made it <num value="530000">530,000</num>; and yet, by actual census in <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct>, including Westminster, Southwark, and the adjacent hills, it proved to be only <num value="864845">864,845</num>. from   <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct>   to <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>-that is, in <num value="40">forty</num> years-the population of London advanced from <num value="864000">864,000</num>   to   <num value="1873000">1,873,000</num>. In <num value="40">forty</num> years the metropolis had increased above a million, or more than through all the previous history of the kingdom. In <num value="10">ten</num> years more it had swelled to <num value="2361640">2,361,640</num>, or nearly half a million more; and it was calculated, as far back as   <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>, that the annual increase of the population of   London was at the rate of <num value="40000">40,000</num> souls. Accordingly, in <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct> it had risen to <num value="2803034">2,803,034</num>, being an increase in <num value="10">ten</num> years of <num value="441394">441,394</num> souls.   In <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>, again, this number had swelled to <num value="3266987">3,266,987</num>, to which, if the average yearly rate of increase has been maintained since that date--of which there is little doubt-we may now add, at least, another half million. 
   <P>Comparing the population of the metropolis with that of other cities, it may be stated that London contains nearly twice as many people as Pekin (<num value="1">one</num> of the most densely populated capitals in the world); almost thrice as many persons as Jeddo; and treble the number of the inhabitants of Paris; more than <num value="4">four</num> times as many as there are in New York; nearly <num value="7">seven</num> times as many as St. Petersburg; <num value="8">eight</num> times as many as Vienna, Madrid, or Berlin; <num value="9">nine</num> times as many as Naples, Calcutta, Moscow, or Lyons; <num value="13">thirteen</num> times as many as Lisbon, Grand Cairo, Amsterdam, or Marseilles; not less than <num value="20">twenty</num> times as many as Hamburg, Mexico, Brussels, or Copenhagen; and very nearly <num value="30">thirty</num> times as many as Dresden, Stockholm, Florence, or Frankfort. Further, in comparison with our own large cities, it contains nearly <num value="8">eight</num> times as many people as the united towns of Manchester and Salford, and the same proportion as regards Liverpool; <num value="9">nine</num> times as many as Glasgow; <num value="12">twelve</num> times as many as Birmingham; <num value="14">fourteen</num> times as many as Dublin; and upwards of <num value="20">twenty</num> times as many as Edinburgh. In England the following are the <num value="15">fifteen</num> largest towns: Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, Wolverhampton, Newcastle, Plymouth, Bradford, Portsmouth, Stoke-upon-Trent, Hull, Oldham, and Sunderland; and yet their joint population is less than that of London by nearly <num value="30000">30,000</num> souls. This may not be surprising when we are told that <num value="5">five</num> births occur every hour, and that in <num value="1">one</num> week nearly <num value="900">900</num> are added to the inhabitants of the metropolis. 
   <P>A writer in the <title>St. James's Magazine</title> (<datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>) observes that <QUOTE>our metropolitan population is nearly <num value="3">three</num> times as large as that of the Papal States, nearly <num value="3">three</num> times as much as the whole population of Norway; it exceeds by <num value="300000">300,000</num> the whole population of Portugal, by <num value="1300000">1,300,000</num> that of Switzerland, by <num value="200000">200,000</num> that of Roumania. It exceeds that of Canada by <num value="80000">80,000</num>, and surpasses that of the Netherlands by more than half a million. Yet these <num value="2">two</num> countries include independent states, strong and stable monarchies, while London is but a city: still, she is the Niagara of cities. The roar of her population is heard afar off; and, as <num value="1">one</num> man is as another in these days, she is, at the lowest estimate, even by the rule of counting heads, the most important place in the world.</QUOTE> <pb id="P.570" n="570"> 
    <P>Again, a writer in the <foreign lang=la>City Press</foreign> pointed out, in <datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>, that the population of <num value="10">ten</num> Londons would equal that of all Great Britain and Ireland; and that of <num value="350">three hundred and fifty</num> Londons would people the whole globe. <QUOTE>Every <num value="8">eight</num> minutes of every day of every year,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE><num value="1">one</num> person dies in London; and in every <num value="5">five</num> minutes of every day in the year <num value="1">one</num> is born.   London contains <num value="100000">100,000</num> winter tramps, <num value="40000">40,000</num> costermongers, <num value="30000">30,000</num> paupers in the unions; with a criminal class of <num value="16000">16,000</num>, out of whom, in <datestruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct>, it was found that only <num value="7000">7,000</num> could read or write. Suppose an average town with a population of <num value="10000">10,000</num> persons; there are in  London, on Sunday, as many people at work as would fill <num value="10">ten</num> such towns, and as many gin-drinkers as would fill <num value="14">fourteen</num>. <num value="2">Two</num> such towns London could people with   fallen   women; <num value="1">one</num> with gamblers; <num value="3">three</num> with thieves and receivers of stolen goods; and <num value="2">two</num> with children trained in crime. It comprises <num value="2">two</num> such towns of French people, <num value="4">four</num> of Germans, <num value="1">one</num> of Greeks, and more Jews than are to be found in all Palestine. It has as many  Irish as would fill the city of Dublin, and more  Roman Catholics than would fill the city of Rome.  It has <num value="20000">20,000</num> public-houses and   beer-shops, frequented by <num value="500000">500,000</num> people as customers. In  London, <num value="1">one</num> in every <num value="890">890</num> is insane; there is <num value="1">one</num> baker for every <num value="1200">1,200</num> persons, <num value="1">one</num> butcher for every <num value="1500">1,500</num>, <num value="1">one</num> grocer for every <num value="1800">1,800</num>, and <num value="1">one</num> publican for every <num value="650">650</num>.</QUOTE> 
   <P>To place the matter in another point of view, we may state that the size of <QUOTE>Greater London,</QUOTE> with its population of <num value="3">three</num> and a quarter millions (according to the last census returns), may be inferred from the fact that if the metropolis was surrounded by a wall having a north gate, a south gate, an east gate, and a west gate, each of the gates being of sufficient width to allow a column of persons to pass out freely <num value="6">six</num> abreast, and a peremptory necessity required the immediate evacuation of the city, the task could not be accomplished under <num value="4">four</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num> hours, by the expiration of which time the head of each of the <num value="4">four</num> columns would have advanced a no less distance than <num value="75">seventy-five</num> miles from its gate, all the people being in close file, <num value="6">six</num> deep. Or, to take another illustration: if all the Londoners of to-day, men, women, and children, were to stand joined shoulder to shoulder, the line formed by them would stretch nearly from <num value="1">one</num> end of England to the other. Again, if the entire people of the capital were to be drawn up in marching order, <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="2">two</num>, and each couple to be <num value="2">two</num> feet apart from the next, the aggregate length of the great army of Londoners would be not less than <num value="662">662</num> miles, or long enough to reach from   London to Inverness; while, supposing the file to move at the rate of <num value="3">three</num> miles an hour, it would take more than <num value="9">nine</num> days and nights for the aggregate troop of the metropolitan population to pass by. 
    <P>But notwithstanding the alarm which politicians and legislators have at various times expressed, and perhaps felt, at its growth, London has constantly advanced, amidst all impediments and interruptions, to its present gigantic size; and, what is more, it still continues to advance.   Conjecture scarcely dares to fix its limits, for every succeeding year we see some waste ground in the suburbs covered with dwellings, some little village or hamlet in the suburbs united by a continuous street to the great metropolis; until what once, and that at no remote period, was a portion of its environs now forms an integral part of <num value="1">one</num> great and compact city, likely to verify the prediction of  James I. that <QUOTE>England will shortly be London, and London England.</QUOTE> 
    <P>London, then, may well be termed <QUOTE>Babylon the Great;</QUOTE> for even if we accept the statements of Herodotus without any discount, the circuit of ancient Babylon, with its palaces and hanging gardens, was only <num value="120">120</num> stadia, or furlongs; and it reckoned its inhabitants only by myriads, or tens of thousands, and not by millions. Yet the great aggregate of houses called London must now be larger by far than that of ancient Babylon; and at the next census it will appear that the men, women, and children who live within <QUOTE>Greater  London</QUOTE> do not fall far short of <num value="4">four</num> million souls. 
    <P>Even during the <num value="6">six</num> years occupied in the production of this work the course of events has been travelling on so fast that we have every reason to believe the population of <QUOTE>Greater London</QUOTE> has been increased by several thousands; and consequently, as may be easily imagined, whilst we have been writing London has not been standing still in other respects in order that we may take a photograph of its present aspect.   Great alterations for the better have been effected in the dwellings of the poorer inhabitants in many parts of the metropolis, chiefly in consequence of the formation of new streets.   Model lodging-houses have been erected in several localities, many of them being the result of the generous gift of Mr. George Peabody to the poor of London; whilst it appears, from the latest reports, that about <num value="1000">1,000</num> families (averaging <num value="4">four</num> persons each) are in residence in these buildings. Again, Board-schools--in most cases structures of some architectural pretensions--have been erected in almost every district in the metropolis; and in many of our new thoroughfares (such, for instance, <pb id="P.571" n="571">

 as in those caused by the formation of the Holborn Viaduct) the ornamental character of our street architecture is very striking. Then, again, buildings which a few years ago were at a standstill in consequence of commercial depression or <QUOTE>strikes</QUOTE> have been completed, and have taken rank with the older institutions of London. As an instance in point we may mention the Inns of Court Hotel, which, when we wrote our account of Lincoln's Inn Fields, was an unfinished carcase, deserted and desolate in appearance,<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="50">50</num>.</NOTE>
but is now <num value="1">one</num> of the largest and busiest hotels in London.

The <num value="1">first</num> experiments have been made in lighting our gaslamps by electric currents, the scene of these experiments, curiously enough, being Pall Mall, where, as stated by us,<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="138">138</num>.</NOTE> the <num value="1">first</num> experiment was made in lighting the streets of London with gas, some <num value="70">seventy</num> years ago. To this we may add that the telephone, the most recent of our scientific acquirements, promises, at no distant date, to throw the telegraph into the shade. Even since we took our pen in hand at the commencement of the last volume of this work, the Surrey Gardens and Cremorne have been blotted out of existence; whilst, <foreign lang=la>per contra</foreign>, we may record the fact that at least <num value="1">one</num> step has been taken towards freeing the metropolitan bridges from toll. Temple Bar, too, has been swept away, and the New Law Courts, adjoining it, are nearly completed. So quickly is the <QUOTE>Old London</QUOTE> absorbed in the <QUOTE>New!</QUOTE> 
   <P>With such a vast and varied population before us, it may be of interest to pass for a moment to the commissariat department, and glance at the food supply for this <QUOTE>noble army</QUOTE> of Londoners, the supply of bread, water, and gas, and the various other domestic and social arrangements whereby it <QUOTE>lives and moves, and has its being.</QUOTE> 
   <P>In the Middle Ages, as we learn from Stow, the citizens of London were mainly dependent for their daily bread on the bakers of Stratford-le-Bow, who seem to have enjoyed the privilege of bringing their <QUOTE>long carts laden with bread</QUOTE> into the City. But in respect of our supply of bread, as well as in other branches of commerce, free trade has long prevailed. As we learn from the last edition of the <QUOTE>London Post Office Directory,</QUOTE> there are some <num value="200">200</num> corn-merchants engaged in supplying the metropolis with corn and grain, about <num value="140">140</num> corn and flour-factors, about <num value="500">500</num> corn-dealers, about <num value="50">50</num> millers, <num value="2500">2,500</num> bakers, and some <num value="900">900</num> confectioners.  Kent, Essex, Norfolk, and Suffolk have always contributed very largely towards supplying London with corn and grain; but since the introduction of  Free Trade, under the administration of Sir Robert  Peel, great quantities of corn are brought from foreign parts. Of the average quantities of corn which change hands in the London market, as well as the regulations enforced in- conducting the business, ample details will be found in our notice of the Corn Exchange.<NOTE>See Vol. II., pp. <num value="179">179</num>-<num value="183">183</num>.</NOTE>

    <P>The water-supply of London is a subject which has long engaged the serious attention of the  Legislature, and frequent official reports are issued, under the auspices of the Local Government Board, with respect to the quality of the water supplied by the several Metropolitan Water Companies. As to its quantity, it will be sufficient to state that the water used in London for the purposes of drinking, washing, street-cleansing, and the extinction of fires, amounts to upwards of <num value="100000000">100,000,000</num> gallons daily, supplied by <num value="8">eight</num> different companies. <NOTE>See Vol. V., p. <num value="238">238</num>.</NOTE>

    <P>Our metropolitan water-supply is apparently well watched   by a paternal government.   An official report is made monthly by an official inspector as to the condition of the <QUOTE>intake,</QUOTE> the filter-beds, and the volume of supply of each company.   The water is also analysed monthly by duly-qualified public analysts. A yearly report, by the auditor of the accounts, is likewise made to the Board of Works as to the fiscal condition of each undertaking. A report, issued in <datestruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct>, states that the number of miles of streets which contain watermains constantly charged, and upon which hydrants could at once be fixed, was no less than <num value="667">667</num> miles. 
   <P>Herodotus was thought to be telling fables when he recorded the story of the Xanthus and other rivers in Thrace being dried up by the thirsty souls who composed the invading army of Xerxes; but when we state that in <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct> the average daily consumption of water in London was about <num value="119000000">119,000,000</num> gallons, or nearly <num value="30">thirty</num> gallons per head of the population, it would almost appear that we are by degrees drifting into a condition when we shall be in danger of drying up our own rivers by the same means. <QUOTE>What other city in the world,</QUOTE> it <pb id="P.573" n="573"> has been asked, <QUOTE>has provided for the comfort, direct or indirect, of <hi rend=italics>each individual</hi> of its population, a daily supply of so many gallons of this chief article of life?</QUOTE> The contrast is indeed striking between this state of things and the ancient conduits, which doled out water in retail! Whether, therefore, there is any truth or not in the statement of Herodotus respecting the rivers of Thrace, we may certainly assert that in London we have exhausted our rivers, though in another way; for at all events <num value="1">one</num> river has disappeared during the last <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> years by the drying up of the Fleet,<NOTE>See Vols. II., p. <num value="418">418</num>; V., <num value="234">234</num>.</NOTE>
which in former times wound sluggishly down from the northern heights of Hampstead, and mingled its slimy contents with the <QUOTE>silvery</QUOTE> Thames. 
<NOTE RESP=BOLLES><LEMMA id="lemma.573.1">A London Dust-yard</LEMMA></NOTE>

   <P>Since the introduction of gas for lighting the streets of London, about <num value="70">seventy</num> years ago, of which we have spoken in our account of Pall Mall,<NOTE>See Vol. IV., p. <num value="137">137</num>.</NOTE>
both the demand and supply have been on a par with the increase of the population. 
   <P>London affords, in theory at any rate, a good example to other towns as to the removal of street refuse and sewage matter. Since the establishment of the General Board of Health the metropolis has, in this respect, taken and kept the lead.   From and after the year <datestruct value="1847"><year reg="1847">1847</year></datestruct> the abolition of cesspools and the drainage of houses into the sewers had been made compulsory, and upwards of <num value="30000">30,000</num> cesspools were so abolished in the space of <num value="6">six</num> years.   But the evil was only transferred, not removed, for all the sewers by which the cesspools were superseded flowed directly into the Thames; the result was that in about <num value="10">ten</num> years from the commencement of this reform the foulness of the river became unbearable, and measures were taken for the construction of a system of main-drainage, by means of which the sewage is conveyed to a more harmless distance. Of this system of drainage we have already spoken at length in our chapter on <QUOTE>Underground London.</QUOTE> <NOTE>See Vol. V., pp. <num value="233">233</num>-<num value="242">242</num>.</NOTE>   By this system, called the London Main-Drainage Works, is effected the removal of the sewage of a population numbering nearly <num value="4">four</num> millions, packed within an area of   <num value="117">117</num> square miles.   This is conducted to Crossness, <num value="14">fourteen</num> miles below London Bridge, and ultimately discharged into the German Ocean.   Some time ago it was alleged on the part of the Conservancy Board that the matter in suspension was forming a deposit off the outlet, which not only had a tendency to occasion sanitary evils, but also threatened in some degree to interfere with the navigation. The engineer of the works, Sir Joseph Bazalgette, however, has published the result of a careful inquiry, which goes to show that, instead of causing obstruction or offensive deposit, the effect of the outflow at Crossness is to scour the channel, the estuarian deposit in that part of the river having been considerably reduced in quantity between <datestruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1878--"><year reg="1878">1878</year></datestruct>, during which period systematic soundings have been taken by order of the board. It is therefore satisfactory to find that if the sewage is not yet utilised for the production of food it is not producing bad effects on the community. 
   <P>From speaking of its sewers, our thoughts naturally pass to the mud and dust of London. In a previous volume we have made mention of the ash-mounds that were once to be seen in the neighbourhood of King's Cross,<NOTE>See Vol. II., p. <num value="278">278</num>.</NOTE> the hidden treasures of some of which may perhaps have suggested to Charles Dickens the character of the <QUOTE>Golden Dustman,</QUOTE> in his work   entitled <QUOTE>Our Mutual Friend.</QUOTE> That a great deal more is consigned to the dust-bin   than need be, in the shape of <QUOTE>waste,</QUOTE> there is little doubt; indeed, M. Soyer used to say that he could feed <num value="100000">100,000</num> people daily in London with what is thrown into the dustholes of the vast city. 
   <P>It is often said that every man in his lifetime eats a peck at least of dirt; but the Londoner, in all probability, swallows much more than a bushel, if there be truth in the following statement, which we find seriously made in the <title>Quarterly Review</title> a few years ago:-- <QUOTE>The <num value="300000">300,000</num> houses of London are interspaced by a street surface averaging about <num value="44">forty-four</num> square yards per house, and therefore measuring collectively about <num value="13">thirteen</num> and a quarter million square yards, of which a large proportion is paved with granite.   Upwards of <num value="200000">200,000</num> pair of wheels, aided by a considerably larger number of iron-shod horses' feet, are constantly grinding this granite to powder, which powder is mixed with from <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="10">ten</num> cart-loads of horse-droppings per mile of street per diem, besides an unknown quantity of the sooty deposits discharged from half a million of smoking chimneys. In wet weather these several materials are beaten up into the thin, black, gruel-like compound known as London mud; of which the watery and gaseous parts are evaporated, during sunshine, into the air we breathe, while the solid particles dry into a subtle dust, whirled up in clouds by the wind and the horses' feet. These dust-clouds are deposited on our rooms and furniture; on our skins, our lips, and on the air-tubes of our lungs. The close, stable-like smell and flavour of the London air, the rapid soiling of our hands, our linen, and the hangings of our rooms, bear ample witness to the reality of this evil, of <pb id="P.574" n="574"> which every London citizen may find a further and more significant indication in the dark hue of the particles deposited by the dust-laden air in its passage through the   nasal respiratory channels. To state this matter plainly, and without mincing words, there is not at this moment a man in London, however scrupulously clean, nor a woman, however sensitively delicate, whose skin and clothes and nostrils are not of necessity more or less loaded with a compound of powdered granite, soot, and still more nauseous substances.      The particles which to-day fly in clouds before the scavenger's broom, fly in   clouds before the parlour-maid's brush, and next darken the water in our toilet-basins, or are wrung by the laundress from our calico and cambric.</QUOTE> 
    <P>Of the <num value="98">ninety-eight</num> parish churches within the walls of the City at the time of the Great Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, only <num value="13">thirteen</num> escaped the   general havoc which was made by the conflagration.   Of those destroyed--<num value="85">eighty-five</num> in number--about <num value="50">fifty</num> were rebuilt, several others being united to those of other parishes. Pepys, in his <title>Diary</title>, under date of <datestruct VALUE="1667-01-7"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=7>7</day>, <year reg=1667>1667</year></datestruct>-<num value="8">8</num>, makes the following singular remarks concerning the churches destroyed in the fire :-- <QUOTE>It is observed, and is true, in the late Fire of London that the fire burned just as many parish churches as there were hours from the beginning to the end of the fire; and next, that there were just as many churches left standing in the rest of the City that was not burned, being, I think, <num value="13">thirteen</num> in all of each; which is pretty to observe.</QUOTE> Of late years, even during the progress of this work, several of the City churches have been swept away, the parishes to which they belonged being united to others, under Act of Parliament. The churches now standing in the City are about <num value="80">eighty</num> in all; and according to Mr. Mackeson's <QUOTE>Guide to the Churches of London and its Suburbs for <datestruct value="1878--"><year reg="1878">1878</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> there are about <num value="1000">1,000</num> in the entire metropolis, the sacred edifices in the suburbs having been more than doubled since the accession of Queen Victoria. 
   <P>It is refreshing to know that suffering humanity is not forgotten in this <QUOTE>great world of London;</QUOTE> and some idea of the benevolence of Londoners may be gathered from   the fact that there are no less than <num value="65">sixty-five</num> general hospitals for the relief and treatment of the various <QUOTE>ills that flesh is heir to.</QUOTE> Besides these, there are scores of other charitable institutions of a special kind, such as dispensaries, invalid   and convalescent hospitals, lunatic asylums, homes and refuges; institutions for the blind, for the deaf and dumb, for incurables, for nurses, for relief of distress, for gentlewomen, for needlewomen, for widows, for infants, for orphans, for the protection of women, for emigration, for employment, for labouring classes, for the benefit of the clergy, dissenting ministers, Jews, soldiers, sailors, discharged prisoners, and debtors; and, lastly, penitentiaries for women. We may add that the number of paupers in the metropolis (exclusive of lunatics and vagrants) receiving parochial assistance is, on an average, from   <num value="80000">80,000</num> in the summer to <num value="100000">100,000</num> in the winter; whilst the total number of vagrants relieved in the course of a day may be set down as ranging between <num value="600">600</num> and <num value="800">800</num>. 
   <P>In such a vast area as London, theatres and other places of amusement are, of course, very numerous, and   are capable   of containing and affording entertainment to thousands of the inhabitants.   Mr. John Hollingshead, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, in <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>-<num value="8">8</num> gave to a Parliamentary Committee an estimate of their number. <num value="1">First</num> are the <num value="2">two</num> patent theatres, Drury Lane and Covent Garden, each capable of holding <num value="4000">4,000</num> persons. Then there are <num value="45">45</num> theatres licensed by the Lord Chamberlain, holding in the aggregate about <num value="80000">80,000</num> persons. There are also <num value="10">ten</num> theatres licensed by the divisional magistrates, <num value="1">one</num> of which houses is the Court Theatre, at Chelsea, about <num value="20">twenty</num> yards outside of the Lord Chamberlain's jurisdiction, and these <num value="10">ten</num> theatres will hold altogether about <num value="38100">38,100</num> persons. The Crystal Palace is included, containing <num value="2">two</num> theatres and <num value="1">one</num> concert-hall under the same roof.   Next come the music-halls.   The Middlesex magistrates license <num value="347">347</num> places, together holding <num value="136700">136,700</num> persons.   These music-halls include <num value="3">three</num> of the <num value="1">first</num>-class, holding from <num value="15000">15,000</num> to <num value="20000">20,000</num> people; <num value="6">six</num> <num value="2">second</num>-class halls, holding from <num value="2000">2,000</num> to <num value="3000">3,000</num>; <num value="13">13</num> <num value="3">third</num>-class halls, holding from <num value="800">800</num> to <num value="1500">1,500</num>; <num value="53">53</num> <num value="4">fourth</num>-class halls, holding from <num value="300">300</num> to <num value="700">700</num> persons; and then there are <num value="272">272</num> smaller places, which may be called public-house concert-rooms or harmonic meetings, or whatever they are termed. The Surrey magistrates also license on the south side of the Thames <num value="61">61</num> music-halls; <num value="58">58</num> are of a smaller type, but <num value="3">three</num> are very large places, and altogether these <num value="61">61</num> will hold <num value="32800">32,800</num> persons. The City of London licenses only <num value="2">two</num>   places--the Sussex Hall and the <QUOTE>White Horse;</QUOTE> but there must be <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> other places where balls and concerts are given, and the City may be stated as having in all these places accommodation for <num value="6400">6,400</num> persons. The total, therefore, is <num value="57">57</num> theatres, capable of holding <num value="126100">126,100</num> persons, and <num value="415">415</num> musichalls, capable of holding <num value="175900">175,900</num> persons, making altogether <num value="472">472</num>   places, accommodating   <num value="302000">302,000</num> persons. This includes the Crystal Palace and the Alexandra Palace, which are   licensed   by the <pb id="P.575" n="575"> magistrates.   Many of the smaller places are probably very small, being rooms in or over public-houses, where there is music but no stage or other appliances--places, in some instances, where people come in the evening and drink their spirits or beer, hear a song or <num value="2">two</num>, and then go away home. 
   <P>We have only to lament, in this general view, the extreme paucity of open parks and places of recreation, which add so much to the attractiveness of Paris and other European capitals.   For, exclusive of the greater parks of London, which are vested in the Crown but open to the public, there are only about <num value="1100">1,100</num> acres of public recreation ground, and these are mostly in distant parts of the suburbs. They are distributed as follows :Black- heath, <num value="267">267</num> acres; Hampstead Heath, <num value="240">240</num> acres; Finsbury Park,   <num value="115">115</num> acres; Southwark Park, <num value="63">63</num> acres; Hackney Downs, <num value="50">50</num> acres; Well Street (Hackney) Common, <num value="30">30</num> acres; North and South Mill Fields, <num value="57">57</num> acres; London Fields, <num value="27">27</num> acres; Tooting Beck Common, <num value="144">144</num> acres; and Tooting Graveney Common, <num value="63">63</num> acres. The gardens on the Thames Embankment and   in Leicester Square present <num value="14">14</num> acres. The remainder of the acreage is made up of the commons at Clapham, Stoke Newington, and Shepherd's Bush. 
   <P>The great metropolis, then, being such as we have portrayed it, there have never been wanting those who have felt towards London and its neighbourhood an attraction which nothing could destroy.  These, of course, have been the persons in whom the social qualities have predominated. Such, in their day, were Horace Walpole, Dr. Johnson,  Samuel Rogers, and Macaulay; and   such, too, were Leigh Hunt, Thackeray, and Dickens. Away from London and its surroundings such men would have been lost; here they found their respective 
 <foreign lang=fr>m&eacute;tiers</foreign>. The Boswellian reasons for Dr. Johnson's love of London are of general applicability. <QUOTE>Johnson,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE>was much attached to  London; he observed that a man stored his mind better there than anywhere else; and that in remote situations a man's body might be feasted, but his mind was starved, and his faculties apt to degenerate, from want of exercise and competition.  No place, too, he said, cured a man's vanity or arrogance so well as London; for as no man was either great or good <foreign lang=la>per se</foreign>, but as compared with others not so good or great, he was sure to find in the metropolis many his equals, and some his superiors.</QUOTE> 
   <P>It would be almost as easy to cull from English writers a long chain of passages in praise of London as of others written in praise of country scenes. Thus Dr. Johnson remarks: <QUOTE>The happiness of London is not to be conceived but by those who have resided in it. I will venture to say there is more learning and science within the circumference of <num value="10">ten</num> miles from where we now sit than in all the rest of the kingdom.   The only disadvantage is the great distance at which people live from <num value="1">one</num> another. But that is occasioned by the very largeness of London, which is the cause of all the other advantages.</QUOTE> If Dr. Johnson could speak thus of the metropolis when its population was under a million, what would he have said now, when we number nearly <num value="4">four</num> million souls within a radius of 
<hi rend=italics><num value="10">ten</num></hi> miles from Charing Cross? Again, the burly doctor thus philosophises on the same subject in a homely and practical strain :-- <QUOTE>London is nothing to some people; but to a man whose pleasure is intellectual London is the place. And there is no place where economy can be so well practised as in London: more can be had here for the money, even by ladies, than anywhere else. You cannot play tricks with your fortune in a small place; you must make an uniform appearance. Here a lady may have well-furnished apartments and an elegant dress, without any meat in her kitchen.</QUOTE> 
    <P>The same opinion is expressed somewhat more bluntly by <QUOTE>Jack</QUOTE> Bannister :-- <QUOTE>I have lived too long (he observes) in London, from early life to the present time, to like the country much; you cannot shake off old habits and acquire new ones.  I must die (please God!) where I have lived so long. Kemble once said to me,  <Q>Depend on it,  Jack, when you pass Hyde Park-corner you leave your comforts behind you.</Q>  <foreign lang=la>Experientia docet!</foreign>
 London for beef, fish, poultry, vegetables too; in the country you get ewe-mutton, cow-beef, and in general very indifferent veal. London is the great market of England. Why?   Because it abounds in customers; and I believe you may live as cheap in London, and nobody know anything about you, as anywhere else. I delight in the country occasionally; but London is your best retirement after long industry and labour.</QUOTE> 
   <P>London has also, in an eminent degree, the great attraction of personal independence and freedom from the eyes of censorious and inquisitive neighbours. This is well drawn out by Boswell, who writes :-- <QUOTE>I was amused by considering with how much ease and coolness he (Dr. Johnson) could write or talk to a friend, exhorting him not to suppose that happiness was not to be found as well in other places as in London; when he himself was at all times sensible of its being, comparatively speaking, a heaven upon earth. The truth is, that by those who from sagacity, attention, and experience have learnt the full advantage of London, <pb id="P.576" n="576"> its pre-eminence over every other place, not only for variety of enjoyment, but for comfort, will be felt with a philosophical exultation. The freedom from remark and petty censure with which life may be passed there is a circumstance which a man who knows the teasing restraint of a narrow circle must relish highly. Edmund Burke, whose orderly and amiable domestic habits might make the eye of observation less irksome to him than to most men, said once, very pleasantly, in my hearing,  <Q>Though I have the honour to represent Bristol, I should not like to live there; I should be obliged to be so much <hi rend=italics>upon my good behaviour</hi>.</Q>  In London, a man may live in splendid society at <num value="1">one</num> time, and in frugal retirement at another, without animadversion. There, and there alone, a man's own house is truly his <hi rend=italics>castle</hi>, in which he can be in perfect safety from intrusion whenever he pleases. I never shall forget how well this was expressed to me <num value="1">one</num> day by Mr. Meynell:  <Q> The chief advantage of London,</Q>  said he,  <Q>is that a man is always <hi rend=italics>so near his burrow</hi>.</Q> </QUOTE> 
   <P>But there are other writers of authority besides Johnson whose testimonies in praise of London deserve to be quoted here; for instance, Lord Macaulay, who writes to a friend: <QUOTE>London is the place for me.   Its smoky atmosphere and muddy river charm me more than the pure air of Hertfordshire and the crystal currents of the Rib. Nothing is equal to the splendid   varieties of London life, the  <Q>fine flow of London talk,</Q>  and the dazzling brilliancy of London spectacles.</QUOTE> 
   <P>Again, we may summon Leigh Hunt, who writes in his <QUOTE>Table Talk :</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>London is not a poetical place to look at; but surely it is poetical in the very amount and comprehensiveness of its enormous experience of pleasure and pain. . . . It is <num value="1">one</num> of the great giant representatives of mankind, with a huge beating heart, and much of its vice and misery . . . . is but <num value="1">one</num> of the forms of the movement of a yet unsteadied progression, trying to balance things, and not without its reliefs.</QUOTE> 
   <P>We have said that to the man of intellectual culture London has attractions beyond all other places. Nor is this position better illustrated and enforced than in the inexhaustible Boswell :-- <QUOTE>Of London, Johnson observed,  <Q>Sir, if you wish to have a just notion of the magnitude of the city, you must not be satisfied with seeing its great streets and squares, but must survey the innumerable little lanes and courts.   It is not in the showy evolutions of buildings, but in the multiplicity of human habitations which are crowded together, that the wonderful immensity of London consists.</Q>   <Q>I have often amused myself,</Q>  adds Boswell,  <Q>with thinking how different a place London is to different people.   They, whose narrow minds are contracted to the consideration of some <num value="1">one</num> particular pursuit, view it only through that medium.   A politician thinks of it merely as the seat of government in its different departments; a grazier, as a vast market for cattle; a mercantile man, as a place where a prodigious deal of business is done upon &lsquo;Change; a dramatic enthusiast, as the grand scene of theatrical entertainments; a man of pleasure, as an assemblage of taverns, and the great emporium for ladies of easy virtue; but the intellectual man is struck with it, as comprehending the whole ot human life in all its variety, the contemplation of which is inexhaustible.</Q> </QUOTE> 
   <P>Charles Dickens, too, is not far behind his compeers in his love of London. Its society and life was <QUOTE>meat and drink</QUOTE> to him--that on which he always set his heart most strongly, in spite of his love for Gad's Hill.   Even when spending the winter in bright and sunny Genoa, he could write home to his friends, <QUOTE>Put me down on Waterloo Bridge at <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock in the evening, with leave to roam about as long as I like, and I would come home, as you know.</QUOTE> In the same spirit he wrote again, at a later date: <QUOTE>For a week or a fortnight I can write prodigiously in a retired place, as at Broadstairs; and then a day in London sets me up again and starts me. But the toil and the labour of writing day after day without that magic-lantern (London) is immense.</QUOTE> 
   <P>It would be almost a sin not to add, by way of conclusion to these testimonies to London's character, the   merry and   good-humoured lines of Captain Morris, the <QUOTE>Laureate of the Beef-steak Club:</QUOTE> --<NOTE>See Vol. III., p. <num value="118">118</num>.</NOTE>
