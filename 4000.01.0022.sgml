                 PREFACE.


FROM the time of Dean Swift downwards to our own
days, many Political Histories of the Reign of Queen
Anne have been written, but its Social Life we have
been left to gather mainly from the efforts of novelists,
who have been more or less conscientious, according
to their knowledge, in placing it before us.
    No doubt the drudgery of the work, the wading
through all the newspapers, and reading all the litera-
ture of the time, has deterred many from attempting
what, in its execution, has proved a very pleasant
task; for in doing it, one has got to be thoroughly
identified with the age-its habits and customs-
which, being taken from the very words of the people
then living, writing for living people, who could con-
tradict their statements, if false or exaggerated, a
charm was lent to the task, which fully compensated
for its labour.
    All history, unless it is contemporary, must neces-
sarily, if honest, be a compilation, and my idea is,
that it should honestly be avowed as such, and the
authorities given for all facts; and this I have done,
even at the risk of proving wearisome.

PREFACE.



    In compiling it, my task has been similar to one
 who, having a necklace of old beads, finds it broken,
 and the beads scattered hither and thither.  His
 business, naturally, is to gather them together, and
 string them so as to satisfy criticism. He may not
 pick them all up, and he may not please everyone's
 taste in his arrangement, but his course is clear-
 he should not add new beads of his own to supply
 deficiencies, but should confine himself to putting
 together all he can find in the best manner he pos-
 sibly can.
   The almost total absence of domestic news in
the newspapers has compelled me to draw largely on
the essays and descriptive books of the time, and in
one or two instances I have ventured to transcribe
(as in the case of Misson) from works published, or
written, two or three years before Anne actually
reigned-but the facts were precisely the same as
then obtained, so that much has been gained thereby.
   The Illustrations might, undoubtedly, have been
made more artistic and unreal-but I have carefully
taken them from contemporary prints, and prefer to
present them in all their uncouthness and reality.

IN all climes, and in all ages, since Man's creation, he has
been subject to the same conditions, modified only by circum-
stances. He has been born-has had to receive some educa-
tion (if only taught to fish and hunt for his subsistence),
which was to fit him for the position he was to occupy in this
life. This was absolutely necessary, for it is scarcely possible
to imagine a more helpless being than an infant. In most
cases he married, and so helped to preserve his species, and
most certainly he died.
   The scheme of existence in Queen Anne's time was no
exception to the normal state of things-only, as the ways
of people then, were not exactly similar to ours, it will
be interesting to note the differences attending childhood,

education, marriage, and death. The Queen herself had more
than once been a mother; 1 but only one child, the Duke of
Gloucester, lived any length of time, and in his infancy he
was indebted for his life to a young Quakeress, who acted as
his wet nurse. Poor little fellow! his brief stay on earth was
not a pleasant one. He suffered from hydrocephalus (water
on the brain), and his head was so big that at five years of age
his hat was large enough for an ordinary man. He could
hardly toddle about, and felt himself unable to go up stairs
without being led. His father and mother seemed to think
that this assistance was not necessary; and, shutting them-
selves in a room with the poor little boy, Prince George gave
him such a severe thrashing with a birch rod, that sheer pain
made him move, and from that time he managed to get up
and down stairs without help. Coddled by the women, and
with somewhat rough playmates of his own sex, he amused
himself by drilling his company of boy soldiers, even re-
viewing them on his eleventh birthday, the day before he
sickened with scarlet fever, of which he speedily died. His
mother grieved sorely for him, but never had another child to
supply his place.
   On her accession to the throne, the succession (failing her
issue) was unsettled, and most anxious was the whole nation
that she should yet be the mother of their future sovereign.
In 'The form of prayer with thanksgiving to Almighty God
to be used in all churches and chapels within this realm, every
year upon the eighth day of March (being the day upon
which Her Majesty began her happy reign),' in the prayer at
the Communion service, immediately before the reading of
the epistle,' for the Queen as supreme Governor of this
Church,' was the following petition: 'And that these Bless-
ings may be continued to after Ages, make the Queen, we
pray thee, an happy Mother of Children, who being Educated
in Thy true Faith and Fear may happily succeed Her in the
Government of these Kingdoms.' Her husband, Prince George,
died October 28, 1708; and it was not until January 13 of
the next year, that the Council struck out this portion of the
service, some one evidently remembering that the 8th of March
                  1   Seventeen times, in fact.

was approaching. On January 28, 1709, both Houses of
Parliament petitioned Her Majesty to marry again ; but her
wounds were too recent and too sore. She replied that the
provision she had made for the Protestant succession would
always be a proof of her hearty concern for the happiness
of the nation; but that the subject of their address was of
such a nature that she was persuaded they did not expect a
particular answer. 1
    Ignorantly as the little Duke of Gloucester was treated,
what was the condition of ordinary babies ? Let a contem-
porary tell the tale. Steele,2 writing as if his familiar Pacolet
was speaking, and giving an experience of his sensations,
says: 'The first thing that ever struck my senses was a
noise over my head of one shrieking ; after which, methought
I took a full jump, and found myself in the hands of a
sorceress, who seemed as if she had been long waking, and
employed in some incantation. I was thoroughly frightened,
and cried out; but she immediately seemed to go on in some
magical operation, and anointed me from head to foot.
What they meant I could not imagine: for there gathered a
great crowd about me, crying, "An heir! an heir! " upon
which I grew a little still, and believed this was a ceremony
only to be used to great persons, and such as made them
what they called heirs.
   'I lay very quiet, but the witch, for no manner of reason
or provocation in the world, takes me, and binds my head as
hard as possibly she could; then ties up both my legs, and
makes me swallow down an horrid mixture. I thought it an
harsh entrance into life, to begin with taking physic; but I
was forced to it, or else must have taken down a great instru-
ment in which she gave it to me. When I was thus dressed, I
was carried to a bedside, where a fine young lady (my mother,
I wot) had liked to have hugged me to death. From her
they faced me about, and there was a thing with quite another
look from the rest of the company, to whom they talked
about my nose. He seemed wonderfully pleased to see me;
but I know since, my nose belonged to another family.

   'That into which I was born is one of the most numerous
among you; therefore crowds of relations came every day
to congratulate my arrival; amongst others, my cousin Betty,
the greatest romp in nature; she whisks me such a height
over her head, that I cried out for fear of falling. She pinched
me and called me squealing chit, and threw me into a girl's
arms that was taken in to tend me. The girl was very proud
of the womanly employment of a nurse, and took upon her
to strip and dress me anew, because I made a noise, to see
what ailed me; she did so, and stuck a pin in every joint
about me. I still cried; upon which she lays me on my face in
her lap; and to quiet me, fell to a-nailing in all the pins, by
clapping me on the back, and screaming a lullaby. But my
pain made me exalt my voice above hers, which brought up
the nurse, the witch I first saw, and my grandmother. The
girl is turned downstairs, and I stripped again, as well to find
what ailed me as to satisfy my granam's farther curiosity. This
good woman's visit was the cause of all my troubles. You
are to understand that I was hitherto bred by hand, and
anybody that stood next me gave me pap if I did but open
my lips; insomuch, that I was grown so cunning as to pre-
tend myself asleep when I was not, to prevent my being
crammed.
   'But my grandmother began a loud lecture upon the idle-
ness of this age, who, for fear of their shapes, forbear suckling
their own offspring; and ten nurses were immediately sent
for; one was whispered to have a wanton eye, and would
soon spoil her milk; another was in a consumption; the
third had an ill voice, and would frighten me instead of
lulling me to sleep. Such exceptions were made against all
but one country milch-wench, to whom I was committed and
put to the breast. This careless jade was perpetually romp-
ing with the footman, and downright starved me; insomuch
that I daily pined away, and should never have been relieved
had it not been that on the thirtieth day of my life a Fellow
of the Royal Society, 1 who had writ upon " Cold Baths," came
to visit me, and solemnly protested I was utterly lost for want
  1 Probably Sir John Floyer, who wrote several books on the wonderful cures
made by cold water bathing.

of that method; upon which he soused me head and ears into
a pail of water, where I had the good fortune to be drowned.'
   After its birth the babe was soon baptized, but there does
not seem to have been a great social fuss made about the
event. That most entertaining and observant traveller Henri
Misson, who visited England at the very close of the seven-
teenth century, and whose book was translated into English
in 1719, 1 says, ' The custom here is not to make great feasts
at the birth of their children. They drink a glass of wine
and eat a bit of a certain cake, which is seldom made but
upon these occasions.'
   Ward, 2 however, has left us a humorous description of a
private christening. He was asked by a relation to stand
Godfather to his newborn Child, and 'I, wanting ill-Nature
enough to resist his Importunities, submitted to his Requests;
and engag'd for once to stand as a Tom Doodle for an hour
or two, to be banter'd by a Tittle-Tattle Assembly of Female
Gossips. The time appointed for the Solemnisation of this
Ancient piece of Formality being come, after I had put on a
clean Band, and bestow'd Two Penniworth of Razorridge on
the most Fertile part of my Face, whose Septuary Crop re-
quir'd Mowing, away I Trotted towards the Joyful Habitation
of my Friend and Kinsman, but with as aking a Heart as a
Wise Man goes to be Married, or a Broken Merchant comes
near the Counter. . . . As soon as we came into the Room, and
had bow'd our Backs to the old Cluster of Harridans, and
they in return had bent their knees to us, I sneak'd up to the
Parson's Elbow, and my Partner after me . . . whilst Old
Mother Grope stood rocking of the Bantling in her Arms,
wrap'd up in so Rich a Mantle as if both Indias had club'd
their utmost Riches to furnish out a Noble covering for my
little Kinsman, who came as callow into the world as a Bird
out of an Eggshell.
   'At last the Babe was put into my hands to deliver, tho'
not as my Act and Deed, to the Parson, who having con-
secrated some New River water for his purpose, wash'd away

Original Sin from my new Nephew, and brought him amongst
us Christians into a state of Salvation. But when my froward
Godson felt the Cold Water in his face, he threaten'd the Priest
with such a parcel of Angry Looks, that if he had been strong
enough I dare swear he would have serv'd him the same
Sauce, and under the same Ignorance would have return'd
him but little thanks for his Labour. After we had joined
together in a Petition for the good of the infant Christian,
the Religious part was concluded. . . . As soon as the Parson
had refreshed his Spirits with a bumper of Canary, dedicated
to the Mother; and the Clerk had said Amen to his Master's
good Wishes, after the like manner, each of 'em accepted of a
Paper of Sweetmeats for his Wife or his Children, and away
they went, leaving the Company behind.' They then seem
to have drunk a full quantity of wine, and the women having
eaten, drank, and gossiped sufficiently, were each presented
with 'a Service of Sweetmeats, which every Gossip carried
away in her Handkerchief. . . . Having now struggled
through every difficult part of these Accustomary Formalities,
I had nothing to do but to Thank them for our Liberal Enter-
tainment, Wish the Women well again, and both much Happi-
ness in their Male Offspring, and so take my Leave, which
I did accordingly; and was as greatly overjoyed when I got
out of the House as ever Convict was that had broke Gaol or
Detected Pick Pocket that had Escaped a Horse Pond.'
   Having launched our baby thus far in life, we will see
how he was treated when suffering from any of the numerous
ailments which infancy is subject to. The marvel is that so
many grew up. It was eminently 'the survival of the fittest.'
Sanitary arrangements were extremely rudimentary; little
care being taken either as to the purity of the water supply,
or the efficiency of drainage. Fever was always in their
midst, and, neither inoculation nor vaccination being known,
or practised, smallpox was rampant, and spared no class, from
the Queen (Mary) to the beggar. Was the child fretful, there
was that cordial dear to old nurses of the Gamp school-
Daffy's Elixir. This remedy, which has survived as a popular
nostrum to our own time, was not new in Queen Anne's
reign. It must then ever have been a profitable property, for

rivals could afford to quarrel over it, as the following advertise-
ments show:-

       'DAFFY'S FAMOUS ELIXIR SALUTIS,1
            PREPARED BY KATHARINE DAFFY.
The Finest now expos'd to Sale, prepar'd from the best
Druggs, according to Art, and the Original Receipt, which
my Father Mr. Thomas Daffy, late Rector of Redmile, in
the Valley of Belvoir, having experienc'd the Virtue of it,
imparted to his Kinsman Mr. Anthony Daffy, who publish'd
the same to the Benefit of the Community, and his own
great Advantage. This Very Original Receipt is now in my
possession, left to me by my Father aforesaid, under his own
Hand. My own Brother Mr. Daniel Daffy, formerly Apothe-
cary in Nottingham, made this ELIXIR from the same Re-
ceipt, and Sold it there during his Life. Those who know
me will believe what I Declare; and those who donot may
be convinc'd that I am no counterfeit, by the Colour, Tast,
Smell, and just Operation of my ELIXIR. To be had at
the Hand and' Pen in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, London;
and many other Places in Town and Country.'
   Prima facie, the lady would seem to have made out her
case; but there were other aspirants to fame-as the following
notice 2 will show :-
                    'ADVERTISEMENT.
   'Forasmuch as Mrs. Elizabeth Daffy has lately Published
an Advertisement containing Invidious Reflections upon me,
in relation to my Elixir Salutis, I should be wanting to my
Self if I should not obviate them in the like public manner, to
let the World see they are Malicious, unreasonable, and false.
   'In the first place she charges me with Clandestinely taking
the House in Prugeon's Court; which, by her leave, is equally
absurd and unjust; for the House was to be Lett a long time
before I took it (nor had she any lease of the House, or any
Power to Lett it), so consequently any one else might have
taken the same. As for my pretending to have been her
Husband's Assistant in preparing the Elixir, I will only say

this is just as true as the former Story; and I challenge her to
produce one single Evidence of Refutation to prove her Asser-
tion: nor had I need of any such trifling pretence, having
known the Secret some time before the Death of his Father
Dr. Anthony Daffy; which I presume was before the said
Elias Daffy was privy to the preparing of the said Elixir (he
being then a Cambridge scholar), and the same was com-
municated to me in the year 1684, at the time I was going to
travel beyond Sea, where, in divers Countries, considerable
Quantities of my Elixir has been taken by Persons of the
greatest Rank, Quality, and Note, to their great Satisfaction.
   'And whereas the said Mrs. Daffy is pleased to call my
Elixir Spurious, and Insinuates as if it were hazardous to the
Lives of Men; the numerous Instances of Good it has done,
both here and abroad, do manifestly evince the Contrary. And
I appeal to all who have taken it in this City, or elsewhere,
whether they have not found at least as much Benefit from
This as from any Thing of the like Nature they have ever
taken; insomuch that I am well assured that those who have
tried mine will apply themselves to nobody else for Elixir
Salutis.                             'JOHN HARRISON.

   ' From my House in Prujean's Court in the Great Old

   One doctor at least, (John Pechy) made the diseases of
infants and children his study, and wrote upon the subject.
I have been unable to get his book, but a few remedies from
the medical works then in vogue will show how these diseases
were then treated. Here is a recipe for a child's cough.1
   'Horehound six; Liquorice, Maidenhair, Hyssop, Wild
Thyme, Coltsfoot, Penny royal, ana Siij. Aniseeds and Fennel
seedsana iss. Raisins of the Sun 3vj. Figs, Jujubes ana 3iv.
Elecampane 3ij, boil all in lb. vj of water to 1/2. Strain, and
add Honey, Sugar, ana lb.j. Boil to a Syrup; and when almost
cold add Orrice, Woodlice, both in fine powder, ana 3j.'

CHILDHOOD and EDUCATION.

   This mixture might not have been bad, but why add
powdered woodlice ?
   Worms in children were to be treated with 'Prevotius's
Oyl to kill Worms.1 Take-Wormwood, Carduus, Scordium,
Tobacco, ana Mj, Roots of Sow bread 3fs, Coloquintida, 3ij,
Oyl, Vinegar, ana lb. j : boil to the consumption of the vinegar,
then add Myrrh in powder j ; mix, and boil to the dissolu-
tion of the Myrrh. The Title shows the Virtues, anoint it
upon the Stomach and Belly.' If this was not effective, the
child might be given some lozenges made as follows-' Take
Rhubarb, Citron seeds husked, Worm seeds, seeds of Purslain,
of Coleworts, Broom finely powdered, ana 3iij dulcis 3ij,
White Sugar 3xvj, all being in fine pouder; mix and in-
corporate with mucilage of Gum Tragacanth, made with
Orange-flower water, of which Past make Lozenges each
weighing 3j. They kill all Worms in the Stomach and
Bowels, and you may give one or two of the lozenges at a
time to a Child in the Morning fasting, but some suppose
that the best time is the last three days of the Moon.'
   The Measles were simply treated-the patient only had
a draught to soothe any cough, 'Let the sick keep their bed
two days after the first coming forth of the spots.' 2
   In teething, a child should be soothed every four hours
with a spoonful of black cherry water, in which two, three,
or four drops of Spirits of Hartshorn have been mixed.3
   There is4 'An experimented Remedy for the Rickets.
Take roots of Smallage, Parsly, Fennel, and Angelica Roots,
slice and boil them in distilled water of Angelica, unset Hyssop
and Coltsfoot, of each one part, till they are tender, then strain
it, and boil it up to a syrup, with white Honey. Then take a
stick of Liquorice, scrape it, and bruise one end of it, and give
the Child with it of the syrup one spoonful in the Morning, at
four of the Afternoon, and at night.'
   There was also advertised 'A necklace that cures all sorts
of Fits in children occasioned by Teeth or any other Cause;
as also all fits in Men and Women. To be had at Mr.
Larance's in Somerset Court, near Northumberland House in

the Strand; price 10s. for 8 days, though the cure will be
performed immediately;' and there was a palatable medium
for the little ones in 'the so-much approved Purging Sugar
Plumbs.'




































    Of the Nursery we know very little; indeed children are
 very seldom mentioned. It is most likely that, in well-to-do
 families, they were relegated to the nursery, and the care of

their mothers, until they were of fit age to go to school. The
accompanying illustration, taken from 'The Ladies' Library,'
ed. 1714, by Steele, gives us an excellent view of the nur-
sery.
   The very babies were amused much as now-for Addison,
Spectator No. 1, speaking of his natural gravity, says, 'I
threw away my rattle before I was two Months old, and
would not make use of my Coral till they had taken away
all the Bells from it.' Some of these corals were very beau-
tiful and costly, even being made of gold.
   We know how, from the earliest ages, a doll has been the
favourite toy with girls, and the reign of 'Good Queen Anne'
was no exception to the general rule
-but they were not then called Dolls,
but' Babies'; so, indeed, were Powel's
Marionettes--as also the milliner's
models. 'On Saturday last, being the
12th instant, there arrived at my
House in King Street, Covent Garden,
a French Baby for the year 1712,' &amp;c.
Some were made of wax, but these
were, of course, of the expensive sort,
as must also have been those in Wi-
dow Smith's raffle-' large joynted
dressed Babies.' Probably, dolls were
the girls' only playthings.  As to
the boys, history records very little
of their amusements. Give a boy in
the nursery a whip, or a stick, to beat
somebody, or something, he generally
is content. How superlatively happy, however, must he have
been in the possession of one of these wonderful horses ?-
warranted chargers-troop horses, every one! They also
had card-board windmills on the end of sticks. We hear
nothing of marbles, tops, or any other toys; but, doubtless,
children's ingenuity supplied any defects that way, then as
now, and made shift to play, and amuse themselves, until
the time of enfranchisement came, and the boy could wander
in the streets and see the marvels of the raree show, and

buy 'hot baked wardens-hot,' or some of old 'Colly Molly
Puffe's' pastry-or, should his tastes be simpler, there were
'Ripe Strawberries,' or 'Sixpence a pound fair Cherryes.'
   These little folk, however, had their special literature.
For there was compiled and printed 'A Play book for Chil-
dren, to allure them to read as soon as they can speak plain;
composed of small Pages so as not to tire children; printed
with a fair and pleasing Letter, the Matter and Method plainer
and easier than any yet extant.' The price of this was four-
pence, and it must have been a favourite, for it is advertised
as being in its second edition in
1703. Certainly, the little ones
then, lacked many advantages in
this way that ours possess- but,
on the other hand, so much was
















not required of them. There was no dreaded 'Exam.' to
prepare for-no doing lessons all day long, and then working
hard at night to get ready for the next day's toil. They
were not taught half a dozen languages, and all the olo-
gies, whilst still in the nursery; but, were the suggestions
and advice given to 'the Mother' in Steele's 'Lady's
Library' thoroughly carried out, they would grow up good
men and women.
   The boys, however, had strong meat provided for them in
such tales as 'Jack and the Giants,' &amp;c. Steele, in Tatler

95, says, speaking of a little boy of eight years old, 'I
perceived him a very great historian in " AEsop's Fables," but
he frankly declared to me his mind "that he did not delight
in that learning, because he did not believe they were true,"
for which reason I found he had very much turned his studies
for about a twelvemonth past unto the lives and adventures
of Don Bellianis of Greece, Guy of Warwick, the Seven
Champions, and other historians of that age ... He would
tell you the mismanagements of John Hickerthrift, find fault
























with the passionate temper in Bevis of Southampton, and
loved Saint George for being the champion of England....
I was extolling his accomplishments, when his mother told
me that the little girl who led me in this morning was in
her way a better scholar than he. " Betty," says she, "deals
chiefly in Fairies and Sprights; and sometimes in a winter
night will terrify the maids with her accounts, until they are
afraid to go up to bed."'
   In all probability the child learned his letters in the

first instance from a ' Hornbook,' such as were then com-
monly used and sold-as the following excerpt from an
advertisement shows: 'Joseph Hazard at the Bible, in
Stationers Court, near Ludgate, sells .. . Spelling books,
Primers, Hornbooks, &amp;c.' Hornbooks are now very scarce
indeed, and the man lucky enough to possess a genuine one
must feel proud of his rarity. It consisted of a small sheet
of paper, generally about 4 in. x 3 in. or so-sometimes
smaller-on which was printed the alphabet, both in capitals
and small text, the vowels, and a few simple combinations,
such as ab, eb, ib, ob, ab,-ba, be, bi, bo, bu, &amp;c., and the
Lord's Prayer. This was laid on a flat piece of board with a
roughly shaped handle, and covered with a thin plate of horn,
fastened to the board by copper tacks driven through an
edging of thin copper. It therefore would stand a vast
amount of rough usage before it would be destroyed-a fact
of great importance in elementary education.
   Private tuition existed then as now. 'A Grave Gentle-
woman of about 50 years of age desires to be Governess to
any Gentleman's Children; she can give a very good account
of herself,' and 'Whereas in this degenerate Age Youth are
kept for so many Years in following the Latin Tongue, and
many of them are quite discourag'd, Mr. Switterda (who
was formerly recommended to the late King William, and
well known by their Excellences my Lord Sparkein and my
Lord Methuen) offers a very easy and delightful Method, by
which any Person of tolerable Capacity, who can but spare
time to be twice a Week with him, and an Hour at a Time,
nay, Children of ten Years of Age, may in one Year learn
to speak Latin and French fluently, according to the Grammar
rules, and to understand a Classical Author; and if they are
not compleat in that time, he will teach them without any
farther Charge, provided they will be manag'd.' Another
gentleman, living in Abchurch Lane, offered to do the same,
and, moreover, 'he offereth to be bound to every one for the
performance thereof, and to give a Month's trial.'
   But a Day School was the normal institution for a boy,
although there were Boarding Schools. Judging by the
advertisements, these must have been but few in the

beginning of the reign, as they gradually become more
numerous towards its close. A record of one or two will
suffice to show what kind of education they gave. ' At the
upper end of Knights Bridge, near the Salutation, there is a
Boarding School for young Gentlemen, where, besides French,
are carefully taught, after the best English method, Latin,
Greek, Writing, Arithmetic, Geography, &amp;c.' And again,' At
Lady Day next will be open'd a Boarding School for young
Gentlemen at Kensington Gravel Pits, by Richard Johnson,
A.M., author of the Grammatical Commentaries .... There
will be taught also French, Writing, Arithmetick, and Mathe-
maticks;' whilst another takes a wider range: 'A boarding
School will be open'd after Easter, at Chertsey ... for the
Instruction of Youth in the English, French, Latin, Greek,
and Hebrew Tongues, besides Geography, History, Mathe-
maticks, Writing, and Accompts; to fit 'em either for the
University, Study of the Law, or other Business.'
   In London, too, were many free schools. There were
Westminster, Merchant Taylors', Paul's, Greyfriars, Christ's
Hospital, and St. Olave's, Southwark. There were three free
schools in Westminster besides the Queen's School; these
were, Palmer's in Tuttlefields, Almery School, and Hill's
School. Besides which were Lady Owen's School, Islington,
and Bunhill School-and there were free schools in Cherry-
tree Alley, Castle Street (Tennyson's), Great Queen Street,
Parker's Lane, Church Entry, Old Jewry, Whitechapel,
Ratcliffe, Foster Lane, Hoxton, St. Saviour's, Southwark,
Plough Yard, Rotherhithe, and East Smithfield-and this
probably is not an exhaustive list.
   Although French, High Dutch, and Italian were taught,
it was a Classical age, and every gentleman was bound to
be a fair, if not a good, classical scholar; indeed, other
branches of education were neglected for this, as Steele com-
plains (Spectator, No. 147) that boys at school, 'When they
are got into Latin, they are looked upon as above English,
the reading of which is wholly neglected, or at least read
to very little purpose.' We might look a long time now-
a-days for an advertisement such as the following: 'At
Hogarth's Coffee House in St. John's Gate, the mid-way

between Smithfield Bars and Clerkenwel, there will meet every
day at 4 o'clock some Learned Gentlemen who speak Latin
readily, where any Gentleman that is either skilled in that
Language, or desirous to perfect himself in speaking thereof,
will be welcome. The Master of the House, in the absence
of others, being always ready to entertain gentlemen in the
Latin Tongue.' It is much to be doubted if that literary
society, the Urban Club, which till lately held its meetings
at the same place, St. John's Gate, could do the same.
   Let us glance at a few of the school books then in vogue.
First of all is one of the immortal Cocker, according to' whom,
all correct calculations should be made. Although he had been
long dead (since 1677), his works lived after him ; and there
were also other works on Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry,
and the use of the Globes. (By the way, a pair of 9-in. diam.
globes only cost a guinea.) There were Latin Dictionaries,
Lilly's Latin Grammar, and an abridgment of it for the use
of Blackheath School. There was that English Grammar
which 'Isaac Bickerstaff' (Steele) puffed up so: 'That as
grammar in general is on all hands allow'd the foun-
dation of all arts and sciences, so it appears to me that this
grammar of the English tongue has done that justice to our
language which, 'till now, it never obtained ;' and there was ' A
Guide to the English Tongue, by Thos. Dyche, schoolmaster
in London,' the second edition of which was published in 171O,
but which has been so popular that a revised edition of it was
published as late as 1816; and there were any quantity of
books on writing-notably the ' Paul's Scholar's Copy Book,
by John Rayner,' immortalised in Tatler 138. The writing
of the age was very good-and many are the specimens of
elaborate caligraphy in the' Bagford Collection': for unassum-
ing and yet good writing, perhaps, however, the best are in
Harl. MS. 5995, 211, &amp;c. In the eighteenth century penman-
ship was held in higher estimation than now, and in 1763 W.
Massey published 'The Origin and Progress of Letters,' in
which he gave the lives of the most famous writing masters
during the preceding hundred years. He mentions some half-

  dozen or more, as living in Anne's reign, but Charles Snell
  seems to have been the most famous.
     As may be supposed, when so much pains was taken in
  writing, there were many curiosities of caligraphic art. Here
  is one: 'A piece of close Knotting, viz. 2 Boys holding
  Circles in their Hands, either being less than a Silver Penny,
  in which are perspicuously wrote the Lords Prayer in Latin
  and English. Invented and perform'd by John Dundas (who
  will shortly publish a Copy book with about 50 new Fancies).
  . . . N.B. Any Gentleman or Lady that desires small Writing
  for a Ring, Locket, or other Curiosity, may be furnished by'
  the Author.'
     That pens other than quill were in use is evidenced by
  an advertisement re a lost pocket-book, which contained
  'a Brass Pen.'
     Stenography was practised somewhat extensively, to
 judge by the numerous advertisements; but William Mason,
 living at the Hand and Pen, in the Poultry, claimed to be
 'the Author and Teacher of the shortest Shorthand extant.'
     And yet, with all these scholastic advantages, some boys
  would not be happy; but, as boys have done ever since
  boarding schools have been invented, they sometimes ran
  away.  Vide the following advertisements: 'A Gentleman's
  only Child is run from School; he is about 12 years of Age,
  with light Cloaths lin'd with red, a well favour'd brisk Boy,
  with a fair old Wig: speaks a little thro' the Scots, his Name
  Alex Mackdonald: he has been in Spain and Portugal,
  which makes his Parents fear that some Ship may entertain
  him.' Whoever captured this lad was to be 'sufficiently
  rewarded,' whilst the next runaway was only valued at 'half
  a guinea and charges,' although he was dressed so smartly:
  'A little slim, fair hair'd handsome English Boy, who speaks
  French very well, between 11 and 12 Years of Age, with a sad
  colour, coarse Kersay Coat trim'd with flat new Gilded Brass
  Buttons, with a whitish Calla-manca Waistcoat with round
  Plate Silver Buttons, and a little Silver Edging to his Hat,
  with fine white Worsted rowl'd Stockings, and with Silver Plate
Buttons to his sad colour Sagathy Stuff Britches: went away
from School on Thursday, the 6th Inst. Supposed to be gone

towards Wapping, Rotherif, Greenwich, or Gravesend, he
having been seen near the Thames Side asking for a Master
to go to sea.' Curious how, in every century since Elizabeth's
time, the runaway English boy naturally flies to the water.
Always the same tale: ran away and went to sea. Here
were two well-nurtured lads, more than ordinarily accom-
plished, yet they were bitten by this same tarantula.
   Let the Spectator describe the rising generation of that
time after they had finished their academic career and had
gone to the university. In No. 54, attributed to Steele,
speaking of Cambridge, he says, 'Now for their manner of
living: and here I shall have a large field to expatiate in;
but I shall reserve particulars for my intended discourse, and
now only mention one or two of their principal exercises.
The elder proficients employ themselves in inspecting mores
hominum multorum, in getting acquainted with all the signs
and windows in the town. Some have arrived to so great
knowledge, that they can tell every time a butcher kills a
calf, every time any old woman's cat is in the straw; and a
thousand matters as important. One ancient philosopher
contemplates two or three hours every day over a sun-dial;
and is true to the dial.
                As the dial to the sun,
                Although it be not shone upon.

Our younger students are content to carry their speculation
as yet no further than bowling greens, billiard tables, and
such like places.'
   Of the reading men, he says, 'They were ever looked
upon as a people that impaired themselves more by their
strict application to the rules of their order than any other
students whatever.  Others seldom  hurt themselves any
further than to gain weak eyes, and sometimes headaches;
but these philosophers are seized all over with a general
inability, indolence, and weariness, and a certain impatience of
the place they are in, with an heaviness in removing to another.
    ' The loungers are satisfied with being merely part of the
number of mankind, without distinguishing themselves from
amongst them. They may be said rather to suffer their time








CHILDHOOD and EDUCATION.



19



to pass than to spend it, without regard to the past or prospect
of the future. All they know of life is only in the present
instant, and do not taste even that. When one of this order
happens to be a man of fortune, the expense of his time is
transferred to his coach and horses, and his life is to be
measured by their motion, not his own enjoyments or sufferings.
The chief entertainment one of these philosophers can possibly
propose to himself is to get a relish of dress. This, methinks,
might diversify the person he is weary of, his own dear self,
to himself. I have known these two amusements make one of
these philosophers make a tolerable figure in the world; with
variety of dresses in public assemblies in town, and quick
motion of his horses out of it, now to Bath, now to Tunbridge,
then to Newmarket, and then to London, he has, in process
of time, brought it to pass, that his coach and his horses have
been mentioned in all these places.' And this description,
with a little alteration, would pass as a fair reflex of modern
undergraduate existence at either Oxford or Cambridge.
    Before closing the question of male education, we must
not forget that in Queen Anne's time was inaugurated that
system of charity schools which has played so prominent a
part in our national system of education, and which has not
yet been superseded by our Board Schools. Steele (Spec-
tator, 380) notices this movement-
                                    'St. Bride's, May 15, 1712.
    'Sir,-'Tis a great deal of Pleasure to me, and I dare say
will be no less Satisfaction to you, that I have an Opportunity
of informing you that the Gentlemen and others of the Parish
of St. Brides have raised a Charity School of fifty Girls as
before of fifty Boys. You were so kind to recommend the
Boys to the Charitable World, and the other Sex hope you will
do them the same Favour in Fridays Spectator for Sunday
next, when they are to appear with their humble Airs at the
Parish Church of St. Brides. Sir, the Mention of this may
possibly be serviceable to the Children; and sure no one will
omit a good Action attended with no expence.

   At the public thanksgiving for peace in 1713, 1 the charity
children were placed in rising rows of seats in the Strand to
see the procession pass, and the Queen go to St. Paul's to
return thanks-and bitter must have been the disappointment
of the little ones at the Queen's absence, on account of illness.
   A  contemporary account of this festival says: 'Upon the
Thanksgiving day for the Peace, about Four Thousand Charity
Children (Boys and Girls), new Cloath'd, were placed upon a
Machine in the Strand, which was in Length above 600 Foot,
and had in Bredth Eight Ranges of seats one above another,
whereby all the Children appear'd in full View of both Houses
of Parliament, in the solemn Procession they made to St.
Paul's upon that joyful Occasion, and who, by their singing
Hymns of Prayer and Praise to God for her Majesty, as well
as by their Appearance, contributed very much to adorn so
welcome a Festival; and gave great Satisfaction to all the Spec-
tators, not without some Surprize to Foreigners who never had
beheld such a glorious Sight. The Trustees of the several
Charity Schools in and about London and Westminster readily
agreed upon Measures for placing the Children in the expected
View of Her Majesty, as a Testimony of their great Duty and
humble Thankfulness to Her Majesty for the particular Coun-
tenance and Encouragement Her Majesty hath always vouch-
safed to give to the Charity Schools,2 whereby She may be
truly stiled their Patron and Protector. Her Majesty not
being present, the Hymns were both sung and repeated during
the whole Procession, which lasted near Three Hours; and for
the Satisfaction and Entertainment of the Publick they are
printed as follows:-

'Hymns to be sung by the Charity Children upon the 7th of
  July, 1713, being the Thanksgiving Day for the PEACE.

  1 There is a very large and beautiful engraving of this scene, from which are
taken the illustrations of carriages, post.
   2 The Queen recommended the design of charity schools to the Archbishops of
Canterbury and York, in a letter dated August 20, 1711 : 'And forasmuch as
the pious Instruction and Education of Children is the surest Way of preserving
and propagating the Knowledge and Practice of true Religion, it hath been very
acceptable to US to hear, that for the Attaining these good Ends, many Charity

                         (GIRLS.)
Boarding schools-Town and country educations-Pastry schools-
     Dancing-Toasts-' The little Whig'-Madame Spanheim.

GIRLS were not all educated at home-though, doubtless,
the majority of them were, with the exception of their
dancing lessons-but had boarding schools of their own;
and the schoolmistresses seem always to have been harassed
by malicious reports. For instance: 'Whereas it is reported
that Mrs. Overing who keeps a Boarding School at Bethnal
Green near Hackney, is leaving off; this is to give Notice that
the said Report is false, if not Malicious. And that she con-
tinues to take sober young Gentlewomen to board, and teaches
whatsoever is necessary to the Accomplishment of that Sex.'
Take another: ' Mrs. Elizabeth Tutchin' continues to keep her
School at Highgate, notwithstanding Reports to the contrary.
Where young Gentlewomen may be soberly Educated, and
taught all sorts of Learning fit for young Gentlewomen.'
Observe the stress that was then laid on the sobriety in-
culcated in these establishments. Read the plays-read the
essays of the time-and then, if they are to be taken at all
as a just standard of feminine conduct, you will, undoubtedly,
come to the conclusion that sobriety of conduct was just the
very quality that required instilling into the heads of the
maidenhood of the time. Pert little hoydens-ogling the
men, flirting their fans, their thoughts always running on a
husband-the schoolmistresses of that time must have had
hard work to keep them serious, and need of most dragon-

like guardianship. They were not taught much, these girls;
'the Needle, Dancing, and the French Tongue,' says one-' a
little Music, on the Harpsichord, or Spinet, to read, write, and
cast accounts in a small way'-this was the sum of their
education. Essentially were they to be housekeepers. Here
is the description an exceptionally accomplished young lady
gives of her own education : ' You know     my father was a
tradesman, and lived very well by his traffick; and I, being
beautiful, he thought nature had already given me part of my
portion, and therefore he would add a liberal education, that
I might be a complete gentlewoman; away he sent me to the
boarding school; there I learned to dance and sing, to play
on the bass viol, virginals, spinet, and guitar. I learned to
make wax work, japan, paint upon glass, to raise paste, make
sweetmeats, sauces, and everything that was genteel and
fashionable.' Here we see the best obtainable education of
the town-bred lady. What was a girl's education in the
country like ? 2

   Priscilla. Did she not bestow good breeding upon you there ?
   Eugenia. Breeding! what, to learn to feed Ducklings, and cram
Chickens ?
   Clara. To see Cows milk'd, learn to Churn, and make Cheese ?
   Eugen. To make Clouted cream, and whipt Sillabubs ?
   Clara. To make a Caraway Cake and raise Py Crust ?
   Eugen. And to learn the top of your skill in Syrrup, Sweetmeats, Aqua
mirabilis, and Snayl water.
   Clara. Or your great Cunning in Cheese cakes, several Creams and
Almond butter.
   Prisc. Ay, ay, and 'twere better for all the Gentlemen in England that
Wives had no other breeding, but you had Musick and Dancing.
   Eugen. Yes, an ignorant, illiterate, hopping Puppy, that rides his
Dancing Circuit thirty Miles about, lights off his tyred Steed, draws his
Kit 3 at a poor Country Creature, and gives her a Hich in her Pace, that
she shall never recover.
   Clara.  And for Musick an old hoarse singing man riding ten miles
from his Cathedral to Quaver out the Glories of our Birth and State, or
it may be a Scotch Song more hideous and barbarous than an Irish
Cronan.
  Eug. And another Musick Master from the next town to Teach one to

twinkle out Lilly burlero 1 upon an old pair of Virginals, that sound worse
than a Tinker's Kettle that he cries his work on.

   We saw that even the accomplished town young lady was
taught how to raise paste, &amp;c.; indeed that was a regular
branch of a girl's education, and all housewifely gifts were
thoroughly appreciated.
   Niece. Good madam, don't upbraid me with my Mother Bridget,
and an excellent housewife.
   Aunt. Yes, I say, she was, and spent her time in better Learning than
ever you did. Not in reading of Fights and Battels of Dwarfs and Giants;
but in writing out receipts for Broths, Possets, Caudles and Surfeit Waters,
as became a good Country Gentlewoman.2

    But, if girls could not learn pastry-making at home, or
wanted a higher class of education therein, there were the
forerunners of our 'Schools of Cookery' in the shape of
'Pastry Schools,' where the professor demonstrated. Here is
one of them.   'To all Young Ladies at Edw. Kidder's Pastry
School in little Lincoln's Inn Fields, are taught all Sorts of
Pastry and Cookery, Dutch hollow works, and Butter Works,
on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays in the Afternoon,
and on the same days, in the Morning, at his School in Norris
Street in St. James's Market, and at his School in St. Martin's
Le Grand, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in the
Afternoon. And at his School at St. Mary Overies Dock,
Mondays Tuesdays and Wednesday mornings from 9 to 12.'
    But one branch of a girl's education seems never to have
been neglected-her dancing.      Steele says, 3 'When a girl is
safely brought from her nurse, before she is capable of form-
ing one simple notion of anything in life, she is delivered to
the hands of her dancing master, and with a collar round her
neck, the pretty wild thing is taught a fantastical gravity of
behaviour, and forced to a particular way of holding her
head, heaving her breast, and moving with her whole body;

  1  See Appendix. ' Lilli burlero' and 'Bullen a lah' are said to have been
the watchwords used by the Irish Papists in their massacre of the Protestants in
1641. The ballad to this tune was written in 1686, when James II. made the
Earl of Tyrconnel, a bigoted papist, Lieutenant of Ireland.  The words are
nonsensical, but the tune is catching, and became very popular. This song is
said to have contributed greatly in bringing about the Revolution of 1688.

and all this under pain of never having a husband, if she
steps, looks or moves awry.'
    He gives a humorous description of the dancing master:1
 'There was Colonel Jumper's Lady, a Colonel of the Train
 Bands, that has a great Interest in her Parish; she recom-
 mends Mr. Trott for the prettiest Master in Town, that no
 Man teaches a Jigg like him, that she has seen him rise Six
 or Seven Capers together with the greatest Ease imaginable,
 and that his Scholars twist themselves more ways than the
 Scholars of any Master in Town; besides there is Madam
 Prim, the Alderman's Lady, recommends a Master of her Own
 Name, but she declares he is not of their Family, yet a very
 extraordinary Man in his Way; for, besides a very soft Air he
 has in Dancing, he gives them a particular Behaviour at a
 Tea-Table, and in presenting their Snuff Box: to twirl, flip or
 flirt a Fan, and how to place Patches to the best advantage,
 either for Fat or Lean, Long or Oval Faces.'
    Indeed, dancing was much thought of as an accomplish-
ment, and more will be said of it in its place among the
social habits of the time. One book alone, 'The Dancing
Master' for 1713, 15th ed., contains 358 different figures
and tunes for country dances. It got to be a fine art, and
books were written on ' Chorography' and 'Orchesography,'
illustrated with wonderful 'and most perplexing diagrams.
A contemporary sketch of a dancing academy is interesting.
It is by Budgell.2 'I am a Man in Years, and by an honest
Industry in the World have acquired enough to give my
Children a liberal Education, tho' I was an utter Stranger
to it myself. My eldest Daughter, a Girl of Sixteen, has for
some time past been under the Tuition of Monsieur Rigadoon,
a Dancing Master in the City; and I was prevailed upon by
her and her Mother to go last Night to one of his Balls. I
must own to you, Sir, that having never been at any such
Place before, I was very much pleased and surprized with
that Part of his Entertainment which he called French Dancing.
There were several young Men and Women, whose limbs
seemed to have no other Motion but purely what the Musick
gave them. After this Part was over, they began a Diversion

which they call Country Dancing, and wherein there were
also some things not disagreeable, and divers Emblematical
Figures, compos'd, as I guess, by Wise Men for the Instruction
of Youth.
   'Amongst the rest, I observed one, which I think they call 1
Hunt the Squirrel, in which while the Woman flies, the Man
pursues her; but as soon as she turns, he runs away, and she
is obliged to follow.
   'The Moral of this Dance does, I think, very aptly recom-
mend Modesty and Discretion to the Female Sex.
   ' But as the best Institutions are liable to Corruptions, so,
Sir, I must acquaint you, that very great Abuses are crept into
this Entertainment. I was Amazed to see my Girl handed by,
and handing young Fellows with so much Familiarity; and I
could not have thought it had been in the Child. They very
often made use of a most impudent and lascivious Step called
Setting, which I know not how to describe to you, but by
telling you that it is the very reverse of Back to Back. At
last an impudent young Dog bid the Fiddlers play a Dance
called Mol Patley, 2 and after having made two or three Capers,
ran to his Partner, locked his Arms in hers, and whisked her
round Cleverly above Ground in such manner that I, who sat
upon one of the lowest Benches, saw further above her Shoe
than I can think fit to acquaint you with. I could no longer
endure these Enormities; wherefore, just as my Girl was going
to be made a Whirligig, I ran in, seized on the Child, and
carried her home.'
   Poor Budgell! what would have been his feelings could
he have but seen a galop, or a valse a deux temps ?
   We may now consider the girl's education complete, and,
as she may be 'sweet seventeen' or so, she naturally would
be, if either pretty or witty, 'a TOAST' among her male
friends. This peculiar institution has its rise in Queen
Anne's time, and is aptly described 3 as 'a new name found
out by the Wits, to make a lady have the same effect, as
burridge in the glass when a man is drinking.' Pope, even,
could hardly make it out.

         Say why are beauties prais'd and honour'd most,
         The wise man's passion, and the vain man's toast ?
         Why deck'd with all that land and sea afford,
         Why angels call'd, and angel-like adored ?

   It was an old English custom to put a toast, a roasted
pippin or so, in a hot drink, such as a tankard of spiced ale,
or of sack; and this is whimsically applied as the derivation
of the word used to express the slavish adulation and worship
of the fair sex, as embodied in this custom. 1 'Many of the
Wits of the last age will assert that the word, in its present
sense, was known among them in their youth, and had its
rise from an accident at the town of Bath, in the reign of
Charles the Second. It happened that, on a public day, a
celebrated beauty of those times was in the Cross Bath, and
one of the crowd of her admirers took a glass of the water in
which the fair one stood and drank her health to the Com-
pany. There was in the place a gay fellow half fuddled, who
offered to jump in, and swore, though he liked not the liquor,
he would have the Toast. He was opposed in his resolution;
yet this whim gave foundation to the present honour which is
done to the lady we mention in our liquors, who has ever
since been called a TOAST. Though this institution had so
trivial a beginning, it is now elevated into a formal order;
and that happy virgin, who is received and drunk to at their
meetings, has no more to do in this life but to judge and
accept of the first good offer. The manner of her inaugura-
tion is much like that of the choice of a Doge in Venice: it is
performed by balloting; and when she is so chosen, she reigns
indisputably for that ensuing year; but must be re-elected
anew to prolong her empire a moment beyond it. When she
is regularly chosen, her name is written with a diamond on a
drinking glass. The hieroglyphic of the diamond is to shew
her that her value is imaginary; and that of the glass to
acquaint her, that her condition is frail, and depends on the
hand which holds her.' Many of the members of the 'Kit
Cat Club'-Lords Halifax, Wharton, Lansdowne, and Carbury,
Mr. Maynwaring and others-thus immortalised their Toasts.

One, by Lord Lansdowne, will amply serve as an illus-
tration--
          Love is enjoyn'd to make his favourite toast,
          And HARE'S the goddess that delights him most.

    There were two very famous toasts in Queen Anne's
time; one in particular was Lady Sunderland, a daughter of
the Duke of Marlborough, who was known by the sobriquet
of 'The Little Whig.' She was the toast of her party, and
her nickname was so well known that it is said the first
stone of Sir John Vanbrugh's theatre in the Haymarket had
'Little Whig' cut upon it. The other was Mademoiselle
Spanheim, the daughter of Baron Spanheim, Ambassador
Extraordinary from the Court of Prussia. She was very
lovely; indeed, her good looks were proverbial, as the current
expression, 'as beautiful as Madam Spanheim,' shows. She
was married early in the year 171O to the Marquis de Mont-
andre. Her father died here in November of the same year,
aged 81 ; and the Queen presented the Marchioness de Mont-
andre with a thousand guineas, which was the usual present
then given to an ambassador on taking his leave.

WE will suppose our toast to escape the perils to which her
position exposed her, and was not forcibly carried off by some
bold knight, as had been known in this reign 1-' Same
evening Sir Alexander Cumming, Knight of the Shire for
Aberdeen, carried off from the Ring in Hyde Park madam
Dennis and married her; she is said to be worth about
16,000.' Probably his position stood him in good stead, for it
fared differently with one Haagen Swendsen, 2 who was, in 1702,
convicted and executed for stealing Mrs. Rawlins, an heiress.
Nowadays, he would have been unhesitatingly acquitted,
even if he had ever been prosecuted, as there was no real
case against him, and Mrs. Rawlins married him of her own
free will.
   That people could be married young enough is rendered
sufficiently evident by the very painful case of Sir George
Downing and Mary Forester, which excited much interest in
the last year of Anne's reign. It is very lucidly put as a case
for counsel's opinion.3
                        'THE CASE.
   'I. G. D. without the Knowledge and Consent of his
Father (then alive, but accounted not of sound Judgment)

of those in whose Keeping he was, Marry'd, according to the
Church form, to M. F. of the Age of Thirteen.
   '2. This young Couple was put to Bed, in the Day time,
according to Custom, and continu'd there a little while, but in
the Presence of the Company, who all testify they touched not
one the other; and after that, they came together no more;
-the young Gentleman going immediately Abroad, the young
Woman continuing with her Parents.
   ' 3. G. D., after Three or Four Years Travel, return'd home
to England, and being sollicited to live with his lawful Wife,
refus'd it, and frequently and publickly declar'd he never
would compleat the Marriage.
   '4. Fourteen Years have pass'd since this Marriage Cere-
mony was perform'd, each Party having (as is natural to
think) contracted an incurable Aversion to each the other, is
very desirous to be set at liberty; and accordingly Applica-
tion is made to the Legislative power to dissolve this Marriage,
and to give each Party leave, if they think fit, to Marry
elsewhere.
   'The Reasons against such Dissolution are:-
   'First. That each Party was Consenting to the Marriage,
      and was Old enough to give such Consent, according to
      the known Laws of the Kingdom; the Male being
      Fifteen Years Old, the Female Thirteen; whereas the
      Years of Consent are, by Law, Fourteen and Twelve.
   'Secondly. They were actually Marry'd according to the
       Form prescrib'd by the Church of England; the
       Minister pronouncing those solemn Words us'd by our
       Saviour, Those whom God has joyn'd let no Man put
       asunder. They are therefore Man and Wife both by
       the Laws of God and of the Land; and, since nothing
       but Adultery can dissolve a Marriage, and no Adultery
       is pretended here, the Marriage continues indissoluble.'

   And, in the course of some very able pleading, the author
says, 'My Lords, the Years of Consent are not fix'd to Four-
teen or Twelve either by Nature, Reason, or any Law of God;
but purely and meerly by the positive Laws of the Land, which

may change them to Morrow; 1 and if they were chang'd
to Day, no Man in England would, I dare affirm it, be dis-
satisfy'd; it seems so senseless and unreasonable to give our
Children the Power of disposing of their Persons for ever, at
an Age when we will not let them dispose of Five Shillings
without Direction and Advice.'
   However, no pleading could prevail against the actual
law, and this singularly married couple remained, legally,
man and wife.
   In 1690 there was a pamphlet issued by 'A Person of
Quality,'2 advocating a tax on bachelors, and on April 22,
1695, William III. gave his assent to an Act intituled 'An
Act for granting his Majesty certain Rates and Duties upon
Marriages, Births, and Burials, and upon Batchelors and
Widowers for the term  of five years, for carrying on the
War with Vigour.'

    By the Act 8 & 9 Will. III., 'For making good the
Deficiencies of Several Funds therein mentioned,' these taxes
were kept on, and were to be paid until Aug. I, 1706, so that
they were in force during four years of Anne's reign.
    In a most amusing tract 1 this Act is alluded to as a law
discouraging marriage, and proposes to make bachelors of 24
and widowers of 50 pay 20s. per annum, and estimates that a
revenue of 2 and one half millions sterling would accrue.
   There was every freedom of intercourse allowed between
the young of both sexes: they visited, and we have seen
that they mixed in the dancing academies. There was also
the custom of valentines, now become obsolete and unmean-
ing. Misson describes it well, as indeed he did everything he
saw in England. ' On the Eve of the 14th of Feb., St. Valen-
tine's Day, a Time when all living Nature inclines to couple, the
Young Folks in England, and Scotland too, by a very ancient
Custom, celebrate a little Festival that tends to the same End.
An equal Number of Maids and Batchelors get together, each
writes their true or some feign'd Name upon separate Billets,
which they Roll up, and draw by way of Lots, the Maids taking
the Men's Billets, and the Men the Maids; so that each of the
Young Men lights upon a Girl that he calls his Valentine,
and each of the Girls upon a young Man which she calls hers:
By this means each has two Valentines; but the Man sticks
faster to the Valentine that is fallen to him, than to the Valen-
tine to whom he is fallen. Fortune having thus divided the
Company into so many Couples, the Valentines give Balls and
Treats to their Mistresses, wear their Billets several Days upon
their Bosoms or Sleeves, and this little Sport often ends in Love.
There is another kind of Valentine; which is the first young
Man or Woman that Chance throws in your Way in the Street,
or elsewhere, on that Day.'
   The whole of the literature of the day speaks of the ten-

dency of young men to avoid the trammels of matrimony.
Most probably the wild blood engendered in Charles the
Second's time had not yet cooled down, and the licence then
habitual, had hardly been superseded by decorum; but there
were other causes, one of which was the introduction of mar-
riage settlements. These were comparatively new. Steele
calls attention to it:1 'Honest Coupler, the Conveyancer, says
" He can distinguish, upon sight of the parties before they
have opened upon any point of their business, which of the
two has the daughter to sell." Coupler is of our Club, and I
have frequently heard him declaim upon this subject, and
assert "that the Marriage Settlements, which are now used,
have grown fashionable even within his memory."'
   When the theatre, in some late reigns, owed its chief
support to those scenes which were written to put matrimony
out of countenance and render that state terrible, then it was
that pin money first prevailed; and all the other articles were
inserted, which create a diffidence, and intimate to the young
people that they are very soon to be in a state of war with
each other; though this has seldom happened, except the
fear of it had been expressed. Coupler will tell you also
'that jointures were never frequent until the age before his
own; but the women were contented with the third part of
the estate the law allotted them, and scorn'd to engage with
men whom they thought capable of abusing their Children.' He
has also informed me 'that those who are the oldest Benchers
when he came to the Temple told him, the first Marriage
Settlement of considerable length was the invention of an old
Serjeant, who took the opportunity of two testy fathers, who
were ever squabbling, to bring about an alliance between
their Children. These fellows knew each other to be knaves,
and the Serjeant took hold of their mutual diffidence, for the
benefit of the Law, to extend the Settlement to three skins
of parchment.' This was undoubtedly the substance of a
genuine conversation with a lawyer, and is further referred
to in a subsequent paper. Nor did Steele like pin money:
he not only disclaims against it in his essays, but in his
dramatic works-in 'The Tender Husband,' where two fathers
                      1 The Tatler, 199.
   VOL. I.                  D

are squabbling over settlements. One, Sir Harry Gubbin,
says-
   Look y', Mr. Tipkin, the main Article with me is that Foundation of
Wives Rebellion-that cursed Pin Money-Five hundred Pounds per
annum Pin Mony.
   Tipkin. The Word Pin Money, Sir Harry, is a Term--
   Sir H. It is a Term, Brother, we never had in our Family, nor ever
will. Make her Jointure in Widowhood accordingly large, but Four
hundred Pounds a Year is enough to give no account of.
   Tipkin. Well, Sir Harry, since you can't swallow these Pins, I will
abate to Four Hundred Pounds.
   Sir H. And to Mollifie the Article, as well as Specifie the Uses, we'll
put in the Names of several Female Utensils, as Needles, Knitting
Needles, Tape, Thread, Scissors, Bodkins, Fans, Playbooks, with other
Toys of that Nature.
   Addison, too, must needs have a fling at it, and wrote a
whole essay on pin money, 1 and, in a letter therein, gives a
doleful case. 'The education of these my Children, who,
contrary to my expectation, are born to me every Year,
straightens me so much that I have begged their Mother to
free me from the Obligation of the above mentioned Pin
Money, that it may go towards making a Provision for her
family. This Proposal makes her Noble Blood swell in her
Veins, insomuch, that finding me a little tardy in her last
Quarter's Payment, she threatens every Day to arrest me: and
proceeds so far as to tell me, that if I do not do her Justice, I
shall die in a Jayl. To this she adds, when her Passion will
let her argue calmly, that she has several Play Debts on her
Hand, which must be discharged very suddenly, and that she
cannot lose her Money as becomes a Woman of her Fashion,
if she makes me any Abatements in this Article.'
   Supposing the vexed question of settlements or no settle-
ments disposed of, a thing of primary importance before
marriage was to provide the ring, and that, according to the
custom of the day, must have a posy on it.2  'He has likewise
promised me to get the measure of his Mistress's marriage
finger, with a design to make a posy in the fashion of a ring
which shall exactly fit it.' The posy was mostly a couplet-
and as not much sentiment or poetry can be compressed into

two lines, the posies, as far as we can judge, are not very
brilliant efforts of genius. The appended examples are all
genuine of the time, as they are taken from the newspaper
advertisements of things lost.

   And now a word or two as to the Marriages of those times,
and one is fairly surprised at the very little fuss that was
generally made about it. On the Stage, a clergyman coupled
the pair presently, or the young people just left the room and
came back in a few minutes, duly married. And this really
was somewhat like real life, and not a travesty. 'Aunt,
Aunt, run for Doctor Dromedary, and let us be Married before
the Sun reposes,' was a not unnatural request for a young
lady to make. A custom had grown up to avoid the noise
and riot of a public wedding, which, besides, was very expen-
sive-open house being but a small part of it; so it used to be,
that the young people would get married with just sufficient
legal witness, and with the full consent of the parents. Even
the middle class were glad to get rid of the noise of drums,
etc. (which still survives in the marrow bones and cleavers
-the rough music of a lower-class wedding).
           Here Rows of Drummers stand in Martial File,
           And with their Vellom Thunder shake the Pile,
           To greet the new made Bride; 2

and in one of Steele's Spectators (364) is a letter commencing
'I was marry'd on Sunday last, and went peaceably to Bed;
but, to my Surprize, was awaken'd the next Morning by the
Thunder of a Set of Drums.' For this noise the unfortunate
bridegroom had to pay pretty smartly.
    These private marriages had their inconveniences, as
the following advertisement 3 shows: 'Whereas, for several

Reasons, the Marriage of Mrs. Frances Herbert to Capt.
James Price, Son to Brigadier Price of Ireland, was kept
private for some time, which has occasioned some insolent
People to censure her Virtue; to prevent which Censures
for the future, it is thought proper to give this Publick Notice
that she was marry'd to the said Capt James Price on the
18th Day of June last at the Parish Church of St. Bennet's,
Pauls Wharf, London, by License and before Witnesses.'
   Misson adverts to this custom of private marriage as being
very common. 'In England, a Boy may marry at fourteen
Years old, and a Girl at twelve, in spight of Parents and
Guardians, without any Possibility of dissolving their Mar-
riage, tho' one be the Son of a Hog-driver, and the other a
Duke's Daughter. 1  This often produces very whimsical
Matches. There is another thing in it odd enough; for those
Children by this means not only become their own Masters,
but obtain this Advantage at a very easy Rate. If to be
marry'd it were necessary to be proclaim'd three Times in a
full Congregation, their Friends would be inform'd of the
Matter, and might find a Way to disswade a little Girl, that
had taken it into her Head to have a Husband, by giving her
fine Cloaths, pretty Babies, and every Thing else that might
amuse her; but the Wedding is clapp'd up so privately, that
People are amaz'd to see Women brought to Bed of legitimate
Children, without having heard a Word of the Father. The
Law, indeed, requires that the Bans should be publish'd; but
the strange Practice of a dispensing Power makes the Law of
no Manner of Use. To proclaim Bans is a Thing no Body
now cares to have done; very few are willing to have their
Affairs declar'd to all the World in a publick Place, when for
a Guinea they may do it Snug, and without Noise; and my
good Friends the Clergy, who find their Accounts in it, are not
very zealous to prevent it. Thus, then, they buy what they
call a Licence, and are marry'd in their Closets, in Presence of
a couple of Friends, that serve for Witnesses; and this ties them
for ever: Nay, the Abuse is yet greater, for they may be marry'd
without a Licence in some Chappels, which have that Privi-

age of twenty-one years without the consent of her guardians.

lege. . . . Hence comes the Matches between Footmen and
young Ladies of Quality, who you may be sure live no very
easy Life together afterwards: Hence, too, happen Poly-
gamies, easily conceal'd, and too much practised.'
   Sometimes they were married at a tavern. 1 'Whereas a
Couple was marryed at the Ship Tavern without Temple Barr,
London, in March, 1696. The Parson, or any other that was
then Present, is desired to come or send to the Publisher of
this Paper, and give an account of the said Marriage, and
shall be satisfied for their charges of coming or sending, and
loss of time.'
   The irregular marriages were a crying evil of the times-
in spite of legislative efforts to stop them. There was an
Act passed, 6 and 7 Wm. III. cap. 7, sec. 52, for the better
levying the 5s. duty on licences, and imposing a penalty of
100l. for marrying without one-and the 7 and 8 Wm. III. cap.
35 recites this Act, and says it was ineffectual, because the
penalty of 100l. was not extended to every offence of the
same parson-because the parsons employed poor and
indigent ministers, without benefices, or settled habitations,
and because many ministers, being in prison for debt or
otherwise, married persons for lucre and gain.
   There have been certain churches and chapels 2 exempted
from the visitation of the ordinary-and the ministers of
such, usually married without licence or banns-and these
were called 'lawless churches.' In Anne's reign there was one
famous one, St. James', Duke's Place, by Aldgate. Another
was Holy Trinity, Minories, which exercised the same
privilege. The Savoy had not yet been much heard of,
and they did a good business. In the former case, privilege
was claimed, because the Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens
of London were lords of the manor and patrons of the
church, and therefore set up an exemption from the juris-
diction (in matters ecclesiastical) of the Bishop of London.
In the latter, it was pleaded that the living was held direct

Alley, Mitre Court, Fuller's Rents, Baldwin's Gardens, Montague Close, the
Minories, Mint and Clink or Dead Man's Place; but there were many others.

from the Crown, in whose gift it was, and that the minister
held the same by an instrument of dotation, under the Great
Seal of England, and that it was neither a rectory nor
vicarage institutive.  However, the arm of the ecclesiastical
law did once reach Adam Elliott, rector of St. James', and on
Feb. 17, 1686, he was suspended for three years, ab officio et
beneficio, for having married, or having suffered persons to be
married, at the said church, without banns or licence. He was,
however, reinstituted on May 28, 1687, after having petitioned
the Ecclesiastical Commissioners; but he began his old trade
very shortly afterwards, in fact the next day, as appears in
the marriage register of the church-' There were no mar-
riages from the tenth of March till the 29 day of May' 1687.
   People could be, and were, married without licence, both
in the Fleet and Queen's Bench Prisons. It is probable that
prisoners there were duly and properly married by banns in
the prison chapel, long before 1674, which is the date of
the earliest illicit Fleet Register in the Bishop of London's
registry; for, in a letter, Sept. 1613, we read: 1 'Now I am to
enform you that an ancyentt acquayntance of yours and myne
is yesterday maryed in the Fleette, one Mr. Georg Lestor,
and hath maryed Mris Babbington, Mr. Thomas Fanshawe
mother-in-lawe. It is sayed she is a woman of good wealthe
so as nowe the man wylle able to lyve and mayntayn hymself
in prison, for hether unto he hath byne in poor estate.' But,
at all events, the law was set at nought in Anne's reign, as it
was for many a long year afterwards. In 1702 the chaplain
was Robert Elborough, who married but few without banns
or licence, 'but under a colour doth allow his clerk Bartho-
lomew Basset to do what he pleases,' and in 1714 Mr. John
Taylor filled the same office, but he does not seem to have
solemnised matrimony at the Fleet. There was, however, a
low clergyman, named John Gaynam, otherwise Doctor
Gaynam, who did a large trade there in marriages, from 1709
to 1740. A little anecdote of him, though not in Queen
Anne's time, may not be amiss. He was giving evidence at
the Old Bailey on the trial of Robert Hussey for bigamy, in
1733.

   Dr. Gainham. The 9th of September, 1733, I married a couple at the
Rainbow Coffee House, the corner of Fleet Ditch, and entered the mar-
riage in my register, as fair a register as any church in England can pro-
duce. I showed it last night to the foreman of the jury, and my Lord
Mayor's Clerk, at the London Punch House.

   The same practice was followed by others during this
reign. Wm. Wyatt, who moved from the Two Sawyers, at
the corner of Fleet Lane, to the Hand and Pen near Holborn
Bridge, married from 1713 to 1750. John Floud, who was
for some years a prisoner in the Fleet, married from 1709 to
1729. John Mottram,from 1709 to 1725. He was convicted,
in 1716, in the Consistory Court, for marrying illegally, and
was suspended from his ministerial functions for three years.
Jerome Alley, from 1681 to 1707, when he left off marrying
'for some other preferment.' Draper, from  1689 to 1716.
John Evans, from 1689 to 1729. Henry Gower, 1689 to 1718.
Thos. Hodgkins, 1674 to 1728. Ed. Marston, 1713 to 1714.
Oswald, 1712. Nehemiah Rogers, a prisoner, but rector of
Ashingdon, Essex, married between 1700 and 1703. He
seems to have been a specially bright specimen of the Fleet
parson. ' He is a Prisoner, but goes at larg to his P. Living in
Essex, and all places else; he is a very wicked man as lives,
for drinking, whoring, and swearing, he has struck and boxed
the bridegroom in the Chapple, and damned like any com'on
soldier, he marries both within and without the Chapple like
his brother Colton.' This was James Colton, who had been
deprived of his living for evil practices, and married from
1681 to 1721. Benj. Bynes, 1698 to 1711. Walter Stanhope,
1711. Jo. Vice, 1689 to 1713; and J. Wise, in 1709.
   The Queen's Bench was not behind its brother of the Fleet,
but there even greater abuses existed-laymen officiating. 1
' 'Tis expected that a Bill to prevent clandestine Marriages,
under a severe Corporal Penalty, will be brought in very
early next Session of Parliament. For which 'tis said too
just Occasion has been given by a Discovery lately made

               1  The Postboy, October 13/16, 1711.

that Laymen have been suffer'd to marry at the Queen's
Bench; and that John Sarjeant, who now acts there again as
Clerk, has forg'd Certificates of pretended Marriages, for which
he keeps Register books, with large blanks almost in every
Page, whereby very mischievous Frauds are practicable. For
preventing whereof, the late Chaplain labour'd hard with the
most proper Person to command the said books out of the
Clerk's Custody, and not prevailing, resign'd his Office, which
he had discharg'd among the Prisoners, both in the House
and in the Rules, above five years, charitably, having never
receiv'd one Farthing of the Fees thereto annexed.-WILLIAM
TIPPING.'
   This evidently refers to the Marriage Act of Queen Anne
(10 Anne, c. 19), which received the royal assent on May 22,
1712. This was a short Act smuggled in in a long money
bill about duties on 'Sope' and paper, linen, silks, calicoes,
stampt vellom, etc. It renewed, from June 24, 1712, the
penalty of 100l. attaching to the performance of illegal
matches, giving half the penalty to the informer, and, 'if
any gaoler or keeper of any prison shall be privy to, or
knowingly permit, any marriage to be solemnised in his said
prison, before publication of banns, or license obtained as
aforesaid, he shall for every such offence forfeit the sum of
one hundred pounds to be recovered and distributed as afore-
said.' There, then, was an extra duty of 5s. imposed upon
every marriage licence, or certificate of marriage.
    Marriages were made easy. You could go a country
walk and pop in and get married. A newly built church at
Hampstead thus advertises: 'As there are many weddings
at Sion Chapel, Hampstead, five Shillings only is required for
all the Church fees of any Couple that are married there, pro-
vided they bring with them a license or Certificate, according
to the Act of Parliament. Two Sermons are continued to be
preached in the said Chapel every Sunday, and the place will
be given to any Clergyman that is willing to accept of it, to be
approved of.' Early in George the First's time, in 1716, they
offered 'that all persons, upon bringing a licence, and who
shall have their wedding dinner in the gardens, may be

married in the said Chapel, without giving any fee or reward
whatsoever.'
   Whilst on the subject of curious marriages, the following
may well be noticed, extracted from the Parish Register:
'John Bridmore and Anne Sellwood, both of Chiltern All
Saints, were married October 17, 1714.
   'The aforesaid Anne Sellwood was married in her Smock,
without any clothes or head gier on.'
   This is not uncommon, the object being, according to a
vulgar error, to exempt the husband from the payment of any
debts his wife may have contracted in her ante-nuptial con-
dition. This error seems to have been founded on a mis-
conception of the law, as it is laid down 1 that 'the husband
is liable for the wife's debts, because he acquires an absolute
interest in the personal estate of the wife,' etc. An unlearned
person from this might conclude, and not unreasonably, that
if his wife had no estate whatever, he could not incur any
liability.
   Anyhow, after marriage they were liable, as the following
gentlemen knew: Whereas Elizabeth Stephenson, Wife of
George Stephenson, late of Falken Court, near the Queen's
Bench, in Southwark, hath Eloped from her said Husband, and
since hath contracted several Debts with a design to Ruin her
said Husband. These are therefore to give notice to the
Publick, That the said George Stephenson will not on any
Account whatever Pay or allow of any Debt so Contracted
by the said Elizabeth Stephenson, either before or since her
elopement.' 'Whereas Isabella Goodyear, the Daughter of
Rich. Cliffe of Brixhome in the County of Devon, and Wife
of Aaron Goodyear of London, Merchant, about 18 months
since abandon'd and forsook the Bed and since the Board of
Aaron her said Husband, carrying with her in Goods, Plate,
and other Goods to the value of 200 and upwards, and whereas
the said Isabella hath as well been sollicited by the said Aaron
her Husband, as also by several of his acquaintance, to return
to and Cohabit with him, under all assurances of being civilly
receiv'd and maintain'd according to his quality and circum-
stances, which the said Isabella hath, and still doth obstinately

refuse. These are therefore to give notice to all Traders, and
all other persons whatsoever, that from and after this present
Notice they do not maintain, sustain, or detain the said
Isabella from the said Aaron her Husband, or any of his
Goods or Plate carryed off by the said Isabella, either by
lending her Money or Selling her Goods, or by any other
ways whatsoever, under penalty of the law, and forfeiture of
the credit, if any, given to the said Isabella from the Notice
hereof.'
   Having discussed the private hole-and-corner, and clan-
destine marriages, it may be well to inquire the reasons why
these were preferred to the more ceremonious ones. Mainly
on the score of expense, and to get rid of the uproarious
and senseless festivities which accompanied them. Let Misson
describe what one was like: 'One of the Reasons that they
have for marrying secretly, as they generally do in England, is
that thereby they avoid a great deal of Expence and Trouble.
. . . Persons of Quality, and many others who imitate them,
have lately taken up the Custom of being marry'd very late at
Night in their Chamber, and very often at some Country
House. 1 They increase their Common Bill of Fare for some
Days; they dance, they play, they give themselves up for some
small Time to Pleasure; but all this they generally do without
Noise, and among very near Relations. Formerly in France
they gave Livrees de Noces, which was a knot of Ribbands, to be
worn by the Guests upon their Arms; but that is practised now
only among Peasants. In England it is done still among the
greatest Noblemen. These Ribbands they Call Favours,2 and
give them not only to those that are at the Wedding, but
to five hundred People besides; they send them about, and
distribute them at their own houses. . . . Among the Citizens
and plain Gentlemen (which is what they call the Gentry) they
sometimes give these Favours; but it is very Common to avoid
all Manner of Expence as much as Possible. When those of
a middling Condition have a mind to be so extravagant as to
   1 Usually at the father's or guardian's of the lady.
   2 This custom partially survives, and originated in a division among the guests
of the ribbons worn by the bride and bridegroom. These favours were worn for
some weeks in the hat, and were made of a pretty large knot of ribbons of various
colours-gold, silver, carnation, and white.






MARRIAGE.



43



marry in Publick (which very rarely happens) they invite a
Number of Friends and Relations; every one puts on new
Cloaths, 1 and dresses finer than ordinary; the Men lead the
Women, they get into Coaches, and so go in Procession, and
are marry'd in full Day at Church. After Feasting and
Dancing, and having made merry that Day and the next, they
take a Trip into the Country, and there divert themselves very
pleasantly. These are extraordinary Weddings. The Ordinary
ones, as I said before, are generally incognito. The Bride-
groom, that is to say, the Husband that is to be, and the
Bride, who is the Wife that is to be, conducted by their Father
and Mother, or by those that serve them in their room, and
accompany'd by two Bride men and two Bride maids, go early
in the Morning with a Licence 2 in their Pocket and call up
Mr. Curate and his Clerk, tell him their Business; are marry'd
with a low Voice, and the Doors shut; tip the Minister a
Guinea, and the Clerk a Crown ; steal softly out, one one way,
and t'other another, either on Foot or in Coaches; go different
Ways to some Tavern at a Distance from their own Lodgings,
or to the House of some trusty Friend, there have a good
Dinner, and return Home at Night as quietly as Lambs. If the
Drums and Fiddles have notice of it they will be sure to be
with them by Day break, making a horrible Racket, till they
have got the Pence; and, which is worst of all, the whole
Murder will come out. Before they go to bed they take
t'other Glass, &amp;c., and when Bedtime is come the Bride men
pull off the Bride's Garters, which she had before unty'd that
they might hang down, and so prevent a Curious Hand coming
too near her knee. This done, and the Garters being fastened
to the Hats of the Gallants, the Bride maids carry the Bride
into the Bed chamber, where they undress her,3 and lay her
in Bed. The Bridegroom, who by the Help of his Friends is un-
dress'd in some other Room, comes in his Night-gown as soon

  1 This was absolutely necessary, and mourning was also temporarily left off,
unless for a very near relation recently deceased.
  2 The licence was generally shown the clergyman the day before the wedding,
and an appointment made for the ceremony.
  3 There was then, and may be now, a curious superstition that every pin
about the bride must be thrown away and lost. There would be no luck if one
remained. Nor must the bridesmaid keep one, for should she do so she certainly
would not be married before Whitsuntide.

as possible to his Spouse, who is surrounded by Mother, Aunt,
Sisters, and Friends, and without any farther Ceremony gets
into Bed. Some of the Women run away, others remain, and
the Moment afterwards they are all got together again. 1 The
Bridemen Take the Bride's Stockings, and the Bridemaids the
Bridegroom's; both sit down at the Bed's Feet and fling the
Stockings over their Heads, endeavouring to direct them so as
that they may fall upon the marry'd Couple. If the Man's
stockings, thrown by the Maids, fall upon the Bridegroom's
Head, it is a Sign she will quickly be marry'd herself; and the
same Prognostick holds good of the Woman's Stockings
thrown by the Man. Oftentimes these young People engage
with one another upon the Success of the Stockings, tho' they
themselves look upon it to be nothing but Sport. While some
amuse themselves agreeably with these little Follies, others are
preparing a good Posset, which is a kind of Cawdle, a Potion
made up of Milk, Wine, Yolk of Eggs, Sugar, Cinnamon, Nut-
meg, etc. This they present to the young Couple, who swallow it
down as fast as they can to get rid of so troublesome Company;
the Bridegroom prays, scolds, entreats them to be gone, and
the Bride says ne'er a Word, but thinks the more. If they
obstinately continue to retard the Accomplishment of their
Wishes, the Bridegroom jumps up in his Shirt, which frightens
the Women, and puts them to Flight. The Men follow them,
and the Bridegroom returns to the Bride.
   'They never fail to bring them another Sack Posset next
Morning, which they spend in such Amusements as you may
easily imagine. The young Woman, more gay and more con-
tented than ever she was in her Life, puts on her finest Cloaths
(for she was married only in a Mob2), the dear Husband does
the same, and so do the young Guests; they laugh, they
dance, they make merry; and these Pleasures continue a
longer or shorter time, according to the several Circumstances
of Things.'

   Pepys tells of a frolic Lady Castlemaine and the beautiful Frances Terese
Stuart (the original of the Britania on the copper coinage) had : 'That they two
must be married-and married they were-with ring and all other ceremonies of
Church service, and ribbands, and a sack posset in bed, and flinging the stocking.'
  2 A mob was a deshabille dress, scarcely ever mentioned in terms of com-
mendation.






MARRIAGE.

   There was no going away for the honeymoon for the
newly married couple. That trying season was spent at
home, in a somewhat stately manner-receiving company, and
must have been excessively irksome, as the following amusing
account of a citizen's honeymoon shows: 1 'I have lately
married a very pretty body, who being somewhat younger
and richer than myself, I was advised to go a wooing to her in a
finer suit of clothes than ever I wore in my life: for I love to
dress plain, and suitable to a man of my rank. How ever, I
gained her heart by it. Upon the wedding day I put myself,
according to custom, in another suit, fire new, with silver
buttons to it. I am so out of Countenance among my neigh-
bours, upon being so fine, that I heartily wish my clothes well
worn out. I fancy every body observes me as I walk the
street, and long to be in my own plain geer again. Besides,
forsooth, they have put me in a Silk Night gown and a gaudy
fool's cap, and make me now and then stand in the window
with it. I am ashamed to be dandled thus, and cannot look
in the glass without blushing to see myself turned into such a
pretty little master. They tell me I must appear in my wed-
ding suit for the first month at least; after which I am resolved
to come again to my every day's clothes, for at present every
day is Sunday with me. ... I forgot to tell you of my white
gloves, which they say, too, I must wear all the first month.'
   I am afraid some of these good gentlemen beat their wives
sometimes; and even the gallant Sir Richard Steele says :2 I
cannot deny but there are perverse Jades that fall to Men's
Lots, with whom it requires more than common Proficiency in
Philosophy to be able to live. When these are joined to Men
of warm Spirits, without Temper or Learning, they are fre-
quently corrected with Stripes; but one of our famous Lawyers
is of opinion, That this ought to be used sparingly.' On the
other hand, we hear much of hen-pecked men-so that it is
probable, so far as matrimonial jars were concerned, the world
wagged then much as now-without the facility for separation
and divorce which now exists.

THAT some lived to a good old age there can be no doubt;
but a patriarch died in this reign at Northampton, April 5,
1706: 1 'This Day died John Bales of this Town, Button
Maker Aged 130 and some Weeks; he liv'd in the Reigns of
Queen Elizabeth, King James the First, King Charles the First,
Oliver, King Charles the Second, King James the Second,

    This, of course, is exaggeration, but although, as we have
seen, people were sparing in expense over births or marriages,
they were absolutely lavish over funerals, and the undertaker
could well afford to disgorge some of his gains. Was it the
funeral of a rich man, the corpse must straightway be em-
balmed, roughly though it may be. 'Have you brought the
Sawdust and Tar for embalming ? Have you the hangings and
the Sixpenny nails for my Lord's Coat of Arms ?' The hatch-
ment must be put up, and mutes must be stationed at intervals
from the hall door to the top of the stairs. 'Come, you that are
to be Mourners in the House, put on your Sad Looks, and walk
by Me that I may sort you. Ha you! a little more upon the
Dismal. This Fellow has a good Mortal look, place him near
the Corps; That Wanscoat Face must be o' top of the Stairs;
That Fellow's almost in a Fright (that looks as if he were full
of some strange misery) at the Entrance of the Hall. So !-but
I'll fix you all myself. Let's have no Laughing now on any

You ungrateful Scoundrel, Did not I pity you, take you out
of a Great Man's Service, and show you the Pleasure of re-
ceiving Wages ? Did not I give you Ten, then Fifteen and
Twenty Shillings a Week to be Sorrowful? and the more I
give you, I think the Glader you are!'
   The undertaker issued his handbills-gruesome things,
with grinning skulls and shroud-clad corpses, thigh bones,
mattocks and pickaxes, hearses, and what not. 'These are to
Notice, that Mr. John Elphick, Woollen Draper, over against
St. Michael's Church in Lewes, hath a good Hearse, a Velvet
Pall, Mourning Cloaks, and Black Hangings for Rooms to be

   'He also Sells all sorts of Mourning and Half Mourning,
all sorts of Black Cyprus for Scarfs and Hatbands, and White
Silks for Scarfs and Hoods at Funerals; Gloves of all sorts
and Burying Cloaths for the Dead.

   'Eleazar Malory, Joiner at the Coffin in White Chapel,
near Red Lion Street end, maketh Coffins, Shrouds, letteth

for Funerals at Reasonable Rates.'
   The dead were then buried in woollen, which was rendered
compulsory by the Acts 30 Car. II. c. 3 and 36 ejusdem c. I.
The first Act was entitled 'An Act for the lessening the im-
portation of Linnen from beyond the Seas, and the encourage-
ment of the Woollen and Paper Manufactures of the King-
dome.' It prescribed that the curate of every parish shall keep a
register, to be provided at the charge of the parish, wherein to



enter all burials and affidavits of persons being buried in
woollen ; the affidavit to be taken by any justice of the peace,
mayor, or such like chief officer in the parish where the body
was interred ; and if there be no officer, then by any curate
within the county where the corpse was buried (except him in
whose parish the corpse was buried), who must administer the
oath, and set his hand gratis.
   No affidavit to be necessary for a person dying of the
plague. It imposed a fine of 5l. for every infringement, one
half to go to the informer, and the other half to the poor of
the parish.
   This Act was only repealed by 54 Geo. III. c. 108, or in
the year 1815.
   The material used was flannel, and such interments are
frequently mentioned in the literature of the time, and Luttrell

mentions in his diary (Oct. 9, 1703) that the Irish Parliament
had just brought in bills 'for encouraging the linnen manu-

   -Funeral invitations were sent out-ghastly things, such
as the accompanying.



  Elegies, laudatory of the deceased, were sometimes printed
and sent to friends: these were got up in the same charnel-
house style. Indeed, no pains were spared to make a funeral
utterly miserable and expensive. Hatbands were costly items.

famous actress of Anne's reign, who (vide Gentleman's Magazine for March 1731)

'For the encouragement of our English silk called Alamodes,
His Royal Highness the Prince of Denmark, the Nobility, and
other persons of Quality appear in Mourning Hatbands made
of that Silk, to bring the same in fashion, in the place of Crapes,
which are made in the Pope's Country where we send our
Money for them.' Gloves, of course, had to be given to every
mourner. Indeed it is refreshing among the universal spoiling
of the deceased's survivors to find that one man advertises
cheap mourning and funeral necessaries. 'For the good of
the Publick, I Edward Evans, at the Four Coffins in the
Strand, over against Somerset House; Furnish all Necessaries
for all sorts of Funerals, both great and small. And all sorts
of set Mourning both Black and Gray and all other Furniture
sutable to it, fit for any person of Quality. Which I promise
to perform 2s. in the Pound cheaper than any of the Under-
takers in Town or elsewhere.'
   Of course these remarks do not apply to the poor: they
had already started burial clubs or societies, and very cheap
they seem to have been. ' This is to give Notice, that the
Office of Society for Burials, by mutual Contribution of a Half-
penny or Farthing towards a Burial, erected upon Wapping
Wall, is now removed into Katherine Wheel Alley in White
Chappel, near Justice Smiths, where subscriptions are taken
to compleat the number, as also at the Ram in Crucifix lane
in Barnaby Street, Southwark; to which places notice is to be
given of the death of any Member, and where any Person may
havethe Printed Articles after Monday next. And this Thursday
about 7 o'clock Evening will be Buried by the Undertakers the
Corpse of J. S., a Glover over against the Sun Brewhouse, in
Golden Lane; as also a Child from the Corner of Acorn Alley
in Bishopsgate Street, and another Child from the Great Maze
Pond, Southwark.'
   We see in the invitation to Mr. Newborough's funeral that
it was to take place on an evening in January. This probably
was so arranged by the Undertaker (indeed, the custom was
general) to increase his costs, for then the mourners were
furnished with wax tapers. These were heavy, and some-
times (judging from the illustrations to undertakers' handbills)
were made of four tapers twisted at the stem and then branch-

ing out. That these wax candles were expensive enough to
excite the thievish cupidity of a band of roughs the following
advertisement will show: ' Riots and Robberies. Committed in
and about Stepney Church Yard, at a Funeral Solemnity, on
Wednesday the 23rd day of September; and whereas many
Persons, who being appointed to attend the same Funeral with
white Wax lights of a considerable Value, were assaulted in a
most violent manner, and the said white Wax lights taken
from them. Whoever shall discover any of the Persons, guilty
of the said Crimes, so as they may be convicted of the same,
shall receive of Mr. William Prince, Wax Chandler in the
Poultry, London, Ten Shillings for each Person so discover'd,'
&amp;c.1
    We get a curious glimpse of the paraphernalia of a funeral
in the Life of a notorious cheat, 'The German Princess,' who
lived, and was hanged, in the latter part of the seventeenth cen-
tury, and the same funeral customs therein described obtained
in Anne's time. She took a lodging at a house; in a good
position, and told the landlady that a friend of hers, a stranger
to London, had just died, and was lying at 'a pitiful Alehouse,'
and might she, for convenience' sake, bring his corpse there,
ready for burial on the morrow. The landlady consented,
and 'that Evening the Corps in a very handsome Coffin was
brought in a Coach, and plac'd in the Chamber, which was the
Room one pair of Stairs next the street and had a Balcony.
The Coffin being cover'd only with an ordinary black Cloth, our
Counterfeit seems much to dislike it; the Landlady tells her
that for 20s. she might have the Use of a Velvet Pall, with
which being well pleas'd, she desir'd that the Landlady would
send for the Pall, and withal accommodate the Room with her
best Furniture, for the next Day but one he should be bury'd;
thus the Landlady perform'd, getting the Velvet Pall, and
placing on a Side-Board Table 2 Silver Candlesticks, a Silver
Flaggon, 2 Standing gilt Bowls, and several other Pieces of
Plate; but the Night before the intended Burial, our counter-
feit Lady and her Maid within the House, handed to their
Comrades without, all the Plate, Velvet Pall, and other Furni-
ture of the Chamber that was Portable and of Value, leaving the
                  Daily Courant, Sept. 30, 1713.

Coffin and the suppos'd Corps, she and her Woman descended
from the Balcony by Help of a Ladder, which her Comrades
had brought her.' It is needless to say that the coffin contained
only brickbats and hay, and a sad sequel to this story is, that
the undertaker sued the landlady for the loss of his pall, which
had lately cost him 40l.
   Another very costly item in funerals was the giving of
mourning rings. We see the number of rings given at Pepys'
funeral in 1703, and their value, 20s. and 15s., especially when
we consider the extra value of the currency at that period,
must have been a sore burden to the survivors. Thoresby 2
shows to what a prodigal extent this custom might be carried.
'Afternoon, at the Funeral of my excellent and dear friend,
Dr. Thomas Gale, Dean of York, who was interred with great
solemnity: lay in state, 200 rings (besides scarfs to bearers and
gloves to all) given in the room where I was, which yet could
not contain the company.'
   Naturally, a great many must have come to a man in the
course of his life, as we may see by the contents of a box lost
out of a waggon between Stamford and London: ' 3 Hair
Rings, 6 with a Death's Head, about 2 penny weight apiece the
Posie (Prepared be to follow me); 3 other mourning rings
with W. C. ob. 18 Dec. 1702; 1 Ennamelled Ring, 3
Pennyweight twelve grains. W. Heltey, ob. 5 July, AEt. 61.'
And their value may be guessed from 'Lost on Thursday, the
8th Instant one of the late Lord Huntingdon's Funeral Rings.
Whoever brings it to Mr. White's at the Chocolate House in
St. James's shall have two Guineas reward.'
    Besides the rings, hatbands, scarves, and gloves, there was
another tax; for Evelyn,3 noting Pepys' death and burial, says,
' Mr. Pepys had been for neare 40 years so much my particular
friend that Mr. Jackson sent me compleat mourning, desiring
me to be one to hold up the pall at his magnificent obsequies,
but my indisposition hinder'd me from doing him this last
office.'
    The pomp of funerals was outrageous. Gay, observant as
he always was, notes this in 'Trivia,' book 3 :-

          Why is the Herse with 'Scutcheons blazon'd round,
          And with the nodding Plume of Ostrich crown'd?
          No, the Dead know it not, nor profit gain:
          It only serves to prove the Living vain.
          How short is Life ! how frail is human Trust!
          Is all this Pomp for laying Dust to Dust ?

    No wonder he exclaimed against these mortuary extra-
vagances. Take an alderman's funeral as an example: 'On
Wednesday last the Corps of Sir William Prichard, Kt., late
Alderman, and sometime Lord Mayor of the City of London,
(Who died Feb. 18) having lain some days in State, at his House
in Highgate, was convey'd from thence in a Hearse, accom-
panied by several Mourning Coaches with 6 Horses each,
through Barnet and St. Albans to Dunstable; and the next
day through Hockley (where it was met by about 20 Persons
on Horseback) to Woburn and Newport Pagnel, and to his
seat at Great Lynford (a Mile farther) in the county of
Buckingham: Where, after the Body had been set out, with
all Ceremony befitting his Degree, for near 2 hours, 'twas
carried to the Church adjacent in this order, viz. 2 Con-
ductors with long Staves, 6 Men in long Cloaks two and two,
the Standard, 18 Men in Cloaks as before, Servants to the
Deceas'd two and two, Divines, the Minister of the Parish and
the Preacher, the Helm and Crest, Sword and Target, Gauntlets
and Spurs, born by an Officer of Arms; the Surcoat of arms
born by another Officer of Arms, both in their rich Coats of Her
Majesty's Arms embroider'd; the Body, between 6 Persons
of the Arms of Christ's Hospital, St. Bartholomew's, Merchant
Taylors' Company, City of London, empaled Coat and Single
Coat; the Chief Mourner and his 4 Assistants, follow'd by
the Relations of the Defunct, &amp;c. After Divine Service was
perform'd and an excellent Sermon suitable to the Occasion,
preach'd by the Reverend Lewis Atterbury, LL.D., Minister
of Highgate aforesaid, the Corps was interr'd in a handsome
large Vault, in the Ile on the North side of the Church, betwixt
7 and 8 of the clock that Evening.'
    But there was one thing they did not spend so much
money upon as their forefathers did, i.e. on monumental

statuary, &amp;c. In this age the bust, or 'busto,' was used in
preference to the recumbent, or half-figures, of the previous
century; but by far the greater number of mortuary memo-
rials took the form of mural tablets, more or less ornate,
according to the taste and wealth of the parties concerned.
As a rule the epitaph was in Latin-this classical age, and
the somewhat pedantic one that followed, could brook no
meaner tongue in which to eulogise its dead; and their
virtues were pompously set forth in that language which is
common to the whole of the civilised world.
    No account of the funerals of this age would be complete
without seeing what Misson says on the subject :-' As soon
as any Person is dead, they are oblig'd to give Notice thereof
to the Minister of the Parish, and to those who are appointed
to visit dead Bodies. This Custom of visiting dead Bodies was
establish'd after the dreadful Plague that ravag'd London in
1665, to the Intent that it might be immediately known if
there was any Contagious Distemper, and proper Methods
taken to put a Stop to it. They are generally two Women
that do this. The Clerk of the Parish receives their Certifi-
cate, and out of these is form'd an Abridgment that is pub-
lish'd every Week. By this Paper you may see how many
Persons of both Sexes dy'd within that Week, of what Dis-
temper, or by what Accident.
   'There is an Act of Parliament which ordains, That the
Dead shall be bury'd in a Woollen Stuff, which is a Kind of
a thin Bays, which they call Flannel; nor is it lawful to use the
least Needleful of Thread or Silk. (The Intention of this Act
is for the Encouragement of the Woollen Manufacture.) This
Shift is always White; but there are different Sorts of it as to
Fineness, and consequently of different Prices. To make these
Dresses is a particular Trade, and there are many that sell
nothing else; so that these Habits for the Dead are always to
be had ready made, of what Size or Price you please, for
People of every Age and Sex. After they have wash'd the
Body thoroughly clean, and shav'd it, if it be a Man, and his
Beard be grown during his Sickness, they put it on a Flannel
Shirt, which has commonly a Sleeve purfled about the Wrists,
and the Slit of the Shirt down the Breast done in the same








DEATH and BURIAL.



55



Manner. When these Ornaments are not of Woollen Lace, they
are at least edg'd, and sometimes embroider'd with black
Thread. The Shirt shou'd be at least half a Foot longer than
the Body, that the Feet of the Deceas'd may be wrapped in it
as in a Bag. When they have thus folded the End of the
Shirt close to the Feet, they tye the Part that is folded down
with a Piece of Woollen Thread, as we do our Stockings; so
that the End of the Shirt is done into a Kind of Tuft.
   'Upon the Head they put a Cap, which they fasten with a
very broad Chin Cloth, with Gloves on the Hands, and a Cravat
round the Neck, all of Woollen. That the Body may ly the
softer, some put a Lay of Bran, about four inches thick, at the
Bottom of the Coffin. Instead of a Cap, the Women have a
Kind of Head Dress, with a Forehead Cloth. The Body being
thus equipp'd and laid in the Coffin (which Coffin is sometimes
very magnificent), it is visited a second time, to see that it is
bury'd in Flannel, and that nothing about it is sowed with
Thread. They let it lye three or four Days in this Condition;
which Time they allow, as well to give the dead Person an
Opportunity of Coming to Life again, if his Soul has not quite
left his Body, as to prepare Mourning, and the Ceremonies of
the Funeral.
   'They send the Beadle with a List of such Friends and
Relations as they have a Mind to invite; and sometimes they
have printed Tickets, which they leave at their Houses. A little
before the Company is set in Order for the March, they lay the
Body into the Coffin upon two Stools, in a Room where all that
please may go and see it; they then take off the Top of the
Coffin, and remove from off the Face a little square Piece of
Flannel, made on Purpose to cover it, and not fastened to any
Thing; Upon this Occasion the rich Equipage of the Dead does
Honour to the Living. The Relations and chief Mourners are
in a Chamber apart, with their more intimate Friends; and the
rest of the Guests are dispersed in several Rooms about the
House.
   'When they are ready to set out, they nail up the Coffin,
and a Servant presents the Company with Sprigs of Rosemary:
Every one takes a Sprig and carries it in his Hand 'till the Body
is put into the Grave, at which Time they all throw their Sprigs

in after it. Before they set out, and after they return, it is
usual to present the Guests with something to drink, either








































red or white Wine, boil'd with Sugar and Cinnamon, or some
such Liquor. Butler, the Keeper of a Tavern, 1 told me there

was a Tun of Red Port drank at his Wife's Burial, besides
mull'd White Wine. Note, no Men ever go to Women's Burials,
nor the Women to the Men's; so that there were none but
Women at the drinking of Butler's Wine. Such Women in
England will hold it out with the Men, when they have a
Bottle before them, as well as upon t'other Occasion, and
tattle infinitely better than they.
   'The Parish has always three or four Mortuary Cloths of
different Prices, 1 to furnish those who are at the Charge of the
interment. These Cloths, which they Call Palls, are some of
black Velvet, others of Cloth with an edge of white Linnen or
Silk, a foot broad, or thereabouts; For a Batchellor or Maid,
or for a Woman that dies in Child Birth, the Pall is white.
This is spread over the Coffin, and is so broad that the Six or
Eight Men that carry the Body are quite hid beneath it to
their Waste, and the Corners and Sides of it hang down low
enough to be born by those 2 who, according to Custom, are
invited for that purpose. They generally give Black or White
Gloves and black Crape Hatbands to those that carry the Pall;
sometimes also white Silk Scarves.
   'Every Thing being ready to move (it must be remember'd
that I always speak of middling People, among whom the
Customs of a Nation are most truly to be learn'd), one or
more Beadles march first, each carrying a long Staff, at the
End of which is a great Apple or Knob of Silver. The Minister
of the Parish, generally accompany'd by some other Minister,
and attended by the Clerk, walks next; and the Body carry'd
as I said before, comes just after him. The Relations in close
Mourning, and all the Guests two and two, make up the rest
of the Procession. The Common Practice is to carry the corpse
thus into the Body of the Church, where they set it down upon
two Tressels, while either a Funeral Sermon is preach'd, con-
taining an Eulogium upon the deceased, or certain Prayers
said, adapted to the Occasion. If the Body is not bury'd in
the Church, they carry it to the Church Yard belonging to the
same, where it is interr'd in the Presence of the Guests, who
are round the Grave, and they do not leave it 'till the Earth is

thrown in upon it. Then they return Home in the same
order that they came, and each drinks two or three Glasses
more before he goes Home. Among Persons of Quality 'tis
customary to embalm the Body, and to expose it for a Fort-
night or more on a Bed of State. After which they carry it in
a Sort of a Waggon 1 made for that Purpose, and cover'd with
black Cloth, to the Place appointed by the Deceased. This
Cart is attended by a long train of Mourning Coaches belong-
ing to the Friends of the Dead Person.'
   A notice of a Roman Catholic funeral must conclude this
subject. It is taken from the will of 'Mr. Benjamin Dod,
Citizen and Linnen Draper, who fell from his Horse, and dy'd
soon after.'  ' I desire Four and Twenty Persons to be at my
Burial . . . to every of which Four and Twenty Persons . . .
I give a pair of white Gloves, a Ring of Ten Shillings Value, a
Bottle of Wine at my Funeral, and Halfa Crown to be spent at
their Return that Night, to drink my Soul's Health, then on her
Journey for Purification in order to Eternal Rest. I appoint
the Room, where my Corps shall lie, to be hung with Black,
and four and twenty Wax Candles to be burning; on my Coffin
to be affixed a Cross, and this Inscription, Jesus, Hominum
Salvator. I also appoint my Corps to be carried in a Herse
drawn with Six white Horses, with white Feathers, and followed
by Six Coaches, with six Horses to each Coach, to carry the
four and twenty Persons. . . . Item I give to Forty of my
particular Acquaintance, not at my Funeral, to every one of
them a Gold Ring of Ten Shillings Value. ... As for Mourn-
ing I leave that to my Executors hereafter nam'd; and I do
not desire them to give any to whom I shall leave a legacy.'
Here follows a long list of legacies. 'I will have no Presby-
terian, Moderate Low Churchmen, or Occasional Conformists,
to be at or have anything to do with my Funeral. I die in
the Faith of the True Catholic Church. I desire to have a
Tomb stone over me, with a Latin Inscription, and a Lamp, or
Six Wax Candles, to burn Seven Days and Nights thereon.'
   Widows wore black veils, and a somewhat peculiar cap,
and had long trains-allusions to which are very frequent
in the literature of the time. That they were supposed to

ALTHOUGH for the purpose of this work it is necessary to
say somewhat of the houses of the period, it is not worth
while discussing the so-called revival of the architecture of
Queen Anne's time.   The modern houses are quaint and
pretty, but they are innocent of any close connection with
her reign. Artists' and architects' holiday rambles in Holland
are provocative of most of them; 'sweet little bits' having
been brought home in sketch-books from Dordrecht and
kindred happy hunting-grounds for the picturesque.  The
style was not even adopted for mansions-vide Marlborough
House and Blenheim; and the exterior of the ordinary town
houses, even of the better class, was singularly unpretentious.
Hatton 1 is struck with admiration of Queen Square (now
Queen Anne's Gate), and says it is 'a beautiful New (tho'
small) Square, of very fine Buildings.' If he could thus eulogise
its architecture, what must have been the plainness of the
exterior of ordinary houses! It was not that there was a
lack of good architects, for Wren and Vanbrugh were alive,
but the houses and furniture were in conformity with the
spirit of the times-very dull, and plain, and solid. We must
never forget that during nearly the whole of this queen's
reign a cruel war exhausted the people's finances, that trade
was circumscribed, and that there were no mushroom par-

venus, with inflated fortunes made from shoddy or the Stock
Exchange, to spend their wealth lavishly on architecture or
art in any shape.
   A dull mediocrity in thought and feeling prevailed, and if
any originality in architecture was attempted, it would cer-
tainly have been satirised, as it was in the very little-known
poem of The History of Vanbrugh's House.'1

              This hugely turn'd to Architecture.
              He view'd the Edifice, and smil'd,
              Vow'd it was pretty for a Child;
              It was so perfect in its Kind,
              He kept the Model in his Mind.

              But when he found the Boys at Play,
              And Saw 'em dabling in their Clay;
              He stood behind a Stall to lurk,
              And mark the Progress of their Work;

              Thought himself now exactly skill'd,
              And so resolv'd a House to build.

              Taller than MISS'S by two Yards;
              Not a sham Thing of Clay, or Cards;
              And so he did: For in a while,
              He built up such a monstrous Pile,
              That no two Chairmen cou'd be found,
              Able to lift it from the Ground;
              Still at White Hall it Stands in View,
              Just in the Place where first it grew;
              There all the little School Boys run,

of No. 10, with its beautifully turned and carved balusters,
and boldly yet easily carved soffits, is a real treat to see; and
were it to be cleansed from its many coats of paint, and
appear in its original state, it would be an almost matchless
specimen of the domestic building of the time. The ceiling,
too, at the top of the staircase is very beautifully painted,
and was most probably the work either of Laguerre or Thorn-
hill. It is good enough for either of them. No. 11 is inferior
to No. 10, but were its neighbour away it would be looked
upon as a very good type of a house in the reign of Queen
Anne. See also an old house, now used as a Board school,
formerly the residence of Sir C. Wren, in a courtyard in
Water Lane, Eastcheap.
    But a good plan is to judge of the houses by contemporary
evidence and description. ' To be Let, a New Brick House,
Built after the Newest Fashion, the Rooms wainscotted and
Painted, Lofty Stories, Marble Foot paces to the Chimneys,
Sash Windows, glaised with fine Crown Glass, large half Pace
Stairs, that 2 People may go up on a Breast, in a new
pleasant Court planted with Vines, Jesamin, and other Greens,

Carter Lane, near St. Paul's Church Yard, London.' So we
see even as late as 1710 that a staircase capable of accom-
modating two people abreast was a novelty, only to be found
in 'the last thing out' in houses. The windows of these
houses were long but narrow; the smallness of the panes
being rendered necessary by the fact that no large size could
be made in window-glass, it being only of late years that the
manufacture has improved to that extent. Here is another
house described, temp. 1712. ' To be Lett, near Cheapside, A
large new-built House that fronts two Streets of great Trade:
The Shop is lined with Deal all round, and is about 60 Foot
deep one way. There is under the Shop a very good dry
Warehouse that is brickt at Bottom. Joyce and boarded over
it, the Sides and Top is lined with Deal, it is 9 foot between
Floor and Top. There is above Stairs 4 Rooms on a Floor,
almost all Wainscotted, and a large Staircase all Wainscotted.
All the Flat is covered with very thick Lead, with Rails and
Bannisters round the Leads and a large Cupolo on the Top.
Inquire of Mr. Richard Wright at the Perriwig in Bread
Street.'
   This must have been an extra good house, for they were
mostly roofed with tiles, a fact which has practical demon-
stration, for after the terrible storm of Nov. 26, 1703, which
damaged London alone to the extent of a million sterling, and
cost us many men-of-war, the loss of over 1,500 sailors of the
navy, and an unnumbered quantity of merchant seamen,
the price of tiles rose tremendously. On Dec. 7 'there is
to be sold Plain Tiles 50s. a Thousand, and Pan Tiles for 6l.
a Thousand.' The plain tiles went still higher, for on Dec. 24
they were 65s. a thousand.
   As a rule the rooms were fairly lofty, and the walls of the
better class were mostly wainscotted with oak, walnut, chest-
nut, or cedar, and sometimes beautifully carved, and in the
lower-class houses with deal, painted. But wall papers were
coming in. 1 ' At the Blue Paper Warehouse in Alderman-
bury (and nowhere else) in London, are sold the true sorts of
figur'd Paper Hangings, some in pieces of 12 yards long,
others after the manner of real Tapistry, others in imitation of
                1 Postman, December 10/12, 1702.

Irish Stitch, flower'd Damasks, Sprigs and Branches; others
yard Wide, in imitation of Marble and other coloured Wains-
coats; others in yard wide, Emboss'd work, and a curious sort
of Flock work in imitation of Caffaws, and other Hangings of
curious figures and colours. As also Linnen Cloath, Tapestry
Hangings, with a variety of Skreens and Chimney pieces, and
Sashes for Windows, as transparent as Sarconet.' And another
advertisement in next year gives 'imitation of Marbles and
other Coloured Wainscoats, which are to be put in Pannels
and Mouldings made for that purpose, fit for the Hanging of
Parlours, Dining Rooms, and Stair Cases; and others in Yard
wide Emboss'd work, in imitation of Gilded Leather.' The
old style of hangings did not go out at once, for in 1704 was
advertised 'Three Suites of Hanging: one of Forrest Tapistry,
one of clouded Camlet, and one of blue Printed Linsey; the
2 first very good, scarce the worse for wearing--to be sold
very reasonable.'
   Stained glass was not used, generally, for decorative
purposes, save for coats of arms; indeed, the art seems to
have been in a bad way, judging from the following adver-
tisement: ' Whereas the ancient Art of Painting and Staining
Glass has been much discouraged, by reason of an Opinion
generally received, That the Red Colour (not made in Europe
for many Years) is totally lost; These are to give Notice, That
the said Red, and all other Colours are made to as great a
Degree of Curiosity and Fineness as in former Ages by William
and Joshua Price, Glasiers and Glass Painters near Hatton
Garden in Holborn, London, where any Gentlemen, who have
the Curiosity, may be convinc'd by Demonstration, there being
a large Window just now finished for his Grace the Duke of
Leeds, which will be sent into the Country in a few days.'
   Houses were not always let by Agreement, but the leases
were sold; and it is by means of such advertisements that we
are able to get at the rents, which seem to have been very low
-even reckoning the difference of value in money. Certainly
they had none of our modern appliances and conveniences,
which add so considerably to the cost of buildings, nor do
they seem to have been saddled with exorbitant ground rents.

'To be sold a lease of 33 years to come in 5 Houses standing
together on the North side of the Pall Mall, whereon 25l. per
Ann. Rent is reserved. The Houses are let at 200l. a year.' ' A
Gentleman has occasion for a lightsome fashionable House in
some Genteel part of the Town, or very nigh the Town, and
if accommodated with Coach House and Stables it will be
better lik'd, of about 30l., 40l., or 50l. a year Rent.'
    A little way out of town rents were even cheaper than
this. Here would be a boon for rowing men. 'To be let at
Barns adjoyning to Mortlack, fronting the River Thames, is
a convenient little New House, 2 rooms on a floor, so well
situated that it may be shut up, and the Furniture Safe. The
benefit of the air may be had at pleasure, for 6l. 10s. per Ann.'
' Also another House for more private Dwelling, well accom-
modated with a Garden, River Water, etc., well situated for a
Gentleman belonging to the Custom, East India, or African
House, or Navy or Victualling Office, and the rent but 10l.
per Annum. Also a Brick House in the Country, 2 Miles off,
standing pleasantly in a good Air, and but 5l. per Annum to
be Lett.' These instances clearly prove that house rent was
cheap in those days, which makes the price paid for apart-
ments seem rather high. When Swift came to London in
171O, he says: ' I lodge in Bury Street, where I removed a
week ago.  I have the first floor, a dining room and bed
chamber, at eight shillings a week; plaguy deep, but I spend
nothing on eating,' etc. When he removed to Chelsea he had
to pay more. 'I got here in the stage coach with Patrick
and my portmantua for sixpence, and pay six shillings a week
for one silly room, with confounded coarse sheets.' 2 On one
of Ralph Thoresby's visits from Leeds to London3 he 'was
surprised with the old gentlewoman's (Mr. Atkin's mother)
demand of 4s. per week for my lodgings ;' but then that
could only have been a bedroom, for the old gentleman was
always out the whole day.
   It is needless to say that there was more danger of fire
then than now; and the inhabitants of London, very many
of whom must have had a vivid remembrance of that awful
         1 Journal to Stella, letter 4.  2 Ibid. letter 21.

fire in 1666, were not altogether neglectful of their interests
in this matter. In 1710 an Act was passed amending an Act
made in the sixth year of Anne's reign,' for the better pre-
venting of Mischiefs that may happen by Fire.' This Act
dealt with parochial fire-engines, rewards, rates for water
supply and maintenance of same, the thickness of party walls,'
etc., and contained one very useful little clause. 'It is further
enacted, That there shall be left at the House, upon which
there is a Notice of a Fire Plug, a Key to open the Stop Cock,
and also a Pipe for the Water to come thereout, to be made
use of as Occasion shall require.'
   They were also fully alive to the necessity of keeping life-
saving appliances in their houses. 'This is to give Notice,
That the Rope Ladders and other Ropes, so useful for pre-
serving whole Families from the dismal Accidents of Fire, are
to be sold,' etc.
   There were three fire insurance companies, whose leaden
badges used to be nailed on to the houses, to show they were
insured, and in what office; and a reward was offered by the
Friendly Society on July 14, 1705, for the discovery of persons
who had stolen some of them.
   These three insurance companies were: first, the Phoenix,
which was at the Rainbow Coffee House, Fleet Street, and
also by the Royal Exchange, established about the year 1682,
and the assurers in 1710 numbered about 10,000.  The
system was to pay 30s. down, and insure 100l. for seven
years. Second, the Friendly Society, in Palsgrave Court,
without Temple Bar, which was the first (in 1684) that insured
by mutual contribution, where you could insure 100l. for
seven years by paying 6s. 8d. down, and an annual subscrip-
tion of 1s. 4d. In 1710 the number of assured was 18,000.
And thirdly, the Amicable Contributors, at Tom's Coffee
House in St. Martin's Lane (commenced about 1695). Here
a payment of 12s. would insure 100l. for seven years, at the
expiration of which time 10s. would be returned to the
assured--who in 1710 numbered over 13,000. This society
seems to have changed its name to the Hand-in-Hand Fire
Office, who gave up their two establishments at Tom's Coffee
House and the Crown Coffee House, behind the Exchange,

for more suitable premises in Angel Court, Snow Hill, and
notified the change in the Gazette of Jan. 1, 1714.
   All these employed several men in liveries, and with badges
on their arms, to extinguish fire. The accompanying con-
temporary illustration is very rude, but it gives a vivid repre-
sentation of a fire at that time.











    Gay gives the following graphic description of a fire, so
that we may almost fancy we see the firemen at work.

        But hark ! Distress with Screaming Voice draws nigh'r,
        And wakes the slumb'ring Street with Cries of Fire.
        At first a glowing Red enwraps the Skies,
        And borne by Winds the scatt'ring Sparks arise;
        From Beam to Beam, the fierce Contagion spreads;
        The Spiry Flames now lift aloft their Heads,
        Through the burst Sash a blazing Deluge pours,
        And splitting Tiles descend in rattling Show'rs.
        Now with thick Crouds th' enlighten'd Pavement swarms,
        The Fire-man sweats beneath his crooked Arms,
        A leathern Casque his vent'rous Head defends,
        Boldly he climbs where thickest Smoak ascends;
        Mov'd by the Mother's streaming Eyes and Pray'rs,
        The helpless Infant through the Flame he bears;
        With no less Virtue, than through hostile Fire,
        The Dardan Hero bore his aged Sire.
        See forceful Engines spout their levell'd Streams,
        To quench the Blaze that runs along the Beams;
        The grappling Hook plucks Rafters from the Walls,
        And Heaps on Heaps the smoaky Ruine falls.
        Blown by strong Winds the fiery Tempest roars,
        Bears down new Walls, and pours along the Floors:
        The Heav'ns are all a blaze, the Face of Night
        Is cover'd with a sanguine dreadful Light.

        Hark ! the Drum thunders ! far, ye Crouds retire;
        Behold the ready Match is tipt with Fire,

       The Nitrous Store is laid, the smutty Train
       With running Blaze awakes the barrell'd Grain;
       Flames sudden wrap the Walls; with sullen Sound,
       The shatter'd Pile sinks on the smoaky Ground.
   The sanitary arrangements of these houses were very
defective, and the streets at night time must have been
anything but pleasant walks.
   ' We had not walk'd the usual distance between a Church
and an Alehouse, but some Odoriferous Civet Box perfum'd
the Air, and saluted our Nostrils with so refreshing a Nose-
                           gay, that I thought the whole
                           City (Edenboroughe-like) had been
                           over-flow'd with an inundation
                           of Surreverence.' 1
                               The water supply, too, was
                           not good. Old-fashioned wells
                           and pumps, sunk in a crowded
                           city full of cesspools and grave-
                           yards, could not have furnished
                           a healthy supply.  Of course
                           there was the water brought by
                           the city from Highgate and
                           Hampstead, and there was the
                           New River, but it evidently was
                           not sufficient for the use of the
                           inhabitants, or it would not have
                           been hawked about.
   More was furnished by the Thames Water Works by means
of a huge water-wheel, which worked many force-pumps,
and which was erected by a Dutchman named Peter Morrice,
in 1582. This occupied a position on the old bridge, similar
to its being placed close to the stairs by Fishmongers' Hall
at the present time. Although the river was infinitely purer
than at present, yet, being tidal, and the supply being taken
from in shore, it could not have been good for drinking
purposes. There was a new company formed to work this
machine, and in the London Gazette, Oct. 28/Nov. 1, 1703,
is an advertisement: 'This is to give Notice to such Persons
                      1  The London Sy.

as have subscribed for Shares in the Thames Water, That the
Transfers of the said Shares will be ready to be made to the
respective Subscribers to-morrow the 2nd Instant, being the
last day limited in the Contract, at Mr. Nicholas Opie's in
Bartholomew Lane, where the said Contract or Subscription
Roll now lies.'
   Hatton says in his ' New View of London' that 'besides
the old work erected by Mr. Morris, the New placed in
the 4th Arch of the Bridge consists of 2 Wheels with 7
Engines set up about the Year 1702, so there are in all
13 Engines.
   'They are the contrivance of that great English Engineer
Mr. Sorocold, whereby the Thames Water is raised from the N.
end of the Bridge to a very great altitude, by which means
many parts of the City &amp;c. are served with the Thames
Water. The Flux and Reflux of the Water worketh the
Engine. Here are several Proprietors who serve Houses for
the most part at 20s. per Ann. paid quarterly, and they have
proportionately more from Brewhouses, &amp;c., according to what
they Consume. To this Company also belongs the Works at
Broken Wharf and the City Conduit Water.
   'The Old Stock was 500 Shares, and valued at 500l. a
Share, since which those Shares were divided into 1500 Shares,
each valued at about 100l. per Share. They pay the City
700l. per Ann. for the Conduit Water, and about 10l. per
Ann. for the Bridge; Also 300l. to Sir Benj. Ayloff or his
Assignees for the Broken Wharf, to which place 2 of the
Engines at the Bridge do Work, and there are also at that
Wharf 2 Horse Works.
    'They chiefly serve Goodman's Fields, Minories, Hounds-
ditch, White Chapel, and Birchin Lane.
    'Merchant's Water Works are in Harts Horn Lane. 1 He
serves with the Thames Water by Horse Work and Engines.
His Rates are 20s. per Ann.
    ' Mill Bank Water is raised and laid into Houses in the
 Parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster, from the Thames. The
 Water House is situate on the E. side of Mill Bank, for which
 the Proprietors, who are in Number 5, had a Patent granted

them by K. Charles 2 about the Year 1673. Their Stock and
Income is divided into 8 Shares. Rates are at least 10s.
per Ann., but commonly 20s., and for Brewers and extra-
ordinary Occasions more than so many Pounds.'
   The water was supplied in primitive pipes of wood, some
being of the very small bore of one inch. 'The Governor
and Company of the New River, being inclined to contract
for Wooden Pipes of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 Inches Diameter
in the Bore, to be delivered at any Place within the
Bills of Mortality, as occasion shall require, do hereby
give notice, that they shall be ready to receive proposals
for that purpose, any Thursday, at their Office at Puddle
Dock.' 1
   An adventurer's share in the New River Water Company
was then worth 4500 guineas; and Hatton, in his 'New View
of London,' says: 'They now Let the Water to most Houses
without Fine or Lease, according as they Consume Water, to
none less than 22s. 8d. per Ann., but to some Brewers, &amp;c.,
for 40l. per Ann., which, and all common Cocks, they Let by
Lease and Fine.'
   The river was scoured out twice a year, and a staff was
kept of '12 Walkers between Ware and London (who
daily take care that no Infectious or other thing be thrown
into the River that might in any way prejudice it, whereby
it is kept Sweet and Wholesome).'
    The following advertisement appears in the London
Gazette, April 20/May 3, 1703 :' The Governor and Company
of the New River brought from Chadwell and Amwell to
London, having from time to time made several Orders and
Regulations for the Ease and Benefit of those who make use
of their Water; but being informed, that several Misrepresen-
tations are Industriously spread abroad to their Prejudice,
they have thought fit to publish the following Orders, which
have been made from time to time since at several Courts.
Viz:
    'Ordered. That no Private Family that is served with the
Water of the New River, shall be required to take a Lease
of the said Water; but that what Rent shall be agreed on with
              1 London Gazette, Feb. 27/Mar. 1, 1714.

the Collectors to be paid, shall be received by them without
the Charge of a Lease.
   'Whereas Strict Charge hath been given to the Collectors,
and all other Officers of the said New River, That they behave
themselves Civilly and Respectfully to such as use the said
Water: If any do otherwise
   'Ordered. That upon any Complaints to the Meetings of
the Company every Thursday at Three in the Afternoon, at
their Office at Puddle Dock, Reparation shall forthwith be
made to the Party grieved.
   ' Ordered. That. any Tenant may employ their own
Plummer to do their Work in mending, or laying any Branch,
such Plummer first acquainting the Collector, and making use
of the Company's Paviour of that Walk to dig the same.'
   The leaden cisterns for holding the family supply were
often very artistically and elaborately ornamented, either with
flowers or classical subjects, and are nearly all dated. The
few now spared in London are of course extremely curious,
as being exemplars of the art manufactures of the time.
   The houses were principally heated by coals, except in the
bedrooms, and, coals being all sea-borne, prices were some-
times very high; thus, latter end of April 1702-' Coals are
at 33s. per Chaldron in the Pool, because of the great Impress.
No Ships are to sail till the Fleet is compleatly mann'd.' Be-
sides this, there was a tax of 2s. per chaldron, 'to be applyed
towards finishing St. Paul's Cathedrall,' which was, on Nov. 26,
1702, ordered to be continued till after the year 1708. 1  This
high price was partly fictitious, a 'ring' having been formed
in coals; but they managed those things better then than
now, and held public inquiry on 'forestallers and regraters.' 2
'The lords ordered several persons to attend upon account of
engrossing Coals, and among them two noted quakers; 'tis
said the chief reason of their being so dear is, that several
persons in the north, and some Londoners, have farmed most
of the Coal pits about Newcastle, with design to sell them at
what price they please.' It was even suggested that Govern-
ment should take the matter up. "Tis said a proposal is
made to the parliament, that the queen be the free importer

of Coals, and that they shal never exceed 25s. per Chaldron,
nor be under 20s.'1
   Not only were they dear, but at times poor in quality.
'The late Common Practice at Sunderland of mixing bad sorts
of Coals with the right Lumley Coals, giving such Mixtures
the Name of pure Lumley Coals,' &amp;c., was counteracted by
certificates being given of their genuineness. In Oct. 1711
coals in the Pool were 25s. to 26s. a chaldron. Scotch coals
had, however, been introduced, for we find an advertisement:
'At Mr. Folley's Warehouse on White Fryers Wharf, are a
parcel of Scotch Coals to be Sold Reasonably, being the
                         best that have come to London
                         for many Years, and out of the
                         Earl of Marrs Collyary.' 2
                             But if they were this high price,
                         ex ship, and wholesale, those who
                         bought in small quantities had to
                         pay very heavily. Swift in his letters
                         to Stella is always grumbling at
                         the expense of his modicum of
                         coals, and would stop longer in,
                         and go earlier to, bed, in order to
                         save. Then was it that the cry
                         of 'Small coale !' was heard in the
                         streets-a cry that will always be
                         associated with the memory of
                         Thomas Britton, the 'musical small
coal man,' who died Sept. 14, 1714.
   The stoves used to burn coal were small and portable,
taking the place of the old andirons, and standing unfixed
in the somewhat wide chimney-pieces. It is needless to say
that the modern 'Queen Anne' stoves bear very little likeness
to the genuine article. The back plates were frequently very
ornamental, sometimes having the arms of the owner of the
house upon them. The accompanying illustration, being taken
from an ironmonger's handbill, is probably copied from one he

   Of the furniture of the time-the houses were, to our
idea, very scantily furnished. Take any of the very few
engravings of social life in this reign, and one is astonished
at the bare look of the apartments: a table in the centre,
a few high-backed and clumsy chairs, a square, box-like
settee, are all that are movable; on the walls a picture or
two, sometimes, not always, a looking-glass, occasionally an
alcove with shelves for china and bric-a-brac, and window
curtains-always curtains,-the possession of which must
have entailed much trouble on many housekeepers. Vide

Windows; and taking out some Quaries of the Glass, put their
Hands in and rob the Houses of their Window Curtains.'
   Without doubt, the houses of the wealthy were better fur-
nished, and more artistically. The virtuoso would bring with
him on his return from his 'grand tour' some specimens, both
of pictures and furniture, of the lands he visited. Of the
former, they were invariably originals or copies of the Caracci,
Titian, Palma, Van Dyck, etc., and they were always being
imported or changing hands; but of good furniture we seldom
find any to be sold, such as, for instance, 'Two Cabinets, the
one of 48 drawers, containing great variety of curious Shells,
Agates, Corals, Mocus's' (the Mocha or Moco Stone), 'Medals,
Minerals, and other Rarities. The other finely inlaid with
Flowers and Birds of Stone by Baptist.'
   And the merchants and well-to-do people undoubtedly
had furniture almost invented to show off their china:
' Whereas the New East India Company did lately sell all their
China Ware, These are to Advertise, that a very large parcel
there of (as Broken and Damag'd) is now to be sold by Whole-
sale and Retail, extreamly Cheap, at a Warehouse in Dyer's
Yard. Note.-It's very fit to furnish Escrutores, Cabinets,
Corner Cupboards or Sprigs, where it usually stands for
Ornament only.'
   Naturally, almost all the ornamental ceramics came from
China or Japan-for the state of our own ceramic art was at a
very low ebb; in fact, it was only in its infancy in the middle
of the last century. Some pottery was made in Staffordshire
and York, but it was near London that the manufacture of the
best, such as it was, was seated. The potteries at Fulham
were at work, as also Lambeth and Vauxhall. Thoresby tells
us of this latter :2 'We went by water to Foxhall and the Spring
Garden: I was surprised with so many pleasant walks &amp;c. so
near London. After dinner there, we viewed the pottery and
various apartments there; was most pleased with that where
they were painting divers colours, which yet appear more
beautiful, and of different colours when baked.'
    None of these wares were remarkable at that time for their
beauty, and so the oriental porcelain was naturally the most
     1 Harl. 5996, 147.   2 Thoresby's Diary, May 24, 1714.

admired, and consequently bore away the palm, both for
beauty of form and design. The use of tea, too, largely helped
the consumption of oriental China. The cups and teapots
were home articles for the Chinese to make, and it was very
many years before we, in England, were even nearly rivalling
them.
   Tea necessitated a smaller and more elegant table, so we
find the want supplied by tea and Dutch tables. Lacquer
ware was also in much request, as well for' Tea Tables, Bowls,
Dressing Suites, Cabinets, and
Bellows Boards,' as for screens
to keep off draughts.
   But perhaps the most glo-
rified piece of furniture in the
house, was the bed, which could
be had at all prices, from
the 1 'new sacking bottom'd
Bedsteads as 11s. a piece' to
that imperial couch which was
a prize in a lottery 'by her
Majesty's permission,' 2 'A Rich
Bed, 7 Foot broad, 8 foot long,
and about 14 foot high, in
which is no less than Two
Thousand Ounces of Gold and
Silver wrought in it; Containing four Curtains Embroidered
on both sides alike, on a white Silk Tabby, Three Vallains
with Tassels, three Basses, two Bonegraces, and four Can-
toneers Embroider'd on Gold Tissue Cloth, cost 3,000l., put
up at 1,400l.' This, of course, was an extraordinary bed; but
the price of bed Furniture really seems to have been 'from 6l.
or 7l. per Bed to 40l. per Bed, with all sorts of fine Chain Stitch
Work.' Velvet, both in crimson and other colours, was also
a favourite for bed-hangings, and cost 40l. at least. One
quilt is described, but I fairly give it up-' Stole out of the house
of John Barnes, &amp;c., a Culgee quilt.'

Number of servants-Footmen-Wages-Liveries-' How d'ye'-The
  Upper Gallery-Footmen's Parliament-Accomplishments-White
  slaves from Barbary-Negro slaves-Runaways-Apprentices.

THE quantity of servants in vogue at that time, especially of
male servants, seems to us to be excessive, but when we look
how useful they were, apart from their menial duties, as guards,
and assistants when the carriage stuck in a deep rut when
travelling, and remember that the old feudal system of having
retainers about one for show was then only moribund (it is
not yet dead), their number is accounted for. First on the
list stands my lord's page, who wore his livery, although of
more costly material than that worn by the footman. He
served his apprenticeship as 'a little foot page,' but it was
always understood that, afterwards, his rise in life should be
looked to by his patron. It was very much the same relation
that existed between knight and squire. How he accom-
panied his lord on state occasions is shown in one of the
illustrations of carriages. Steele speaks disparagingly of the
lad's position. ' I know a Man of good Sense who put his
Son to a Blacksmith, tho' an Offer was made him of his being
received a Page to a Man of Quality.'
   But it was the footman of that age, and indeed of the
whole of the early Georgian era, who was the perpetual butt
of the satirist-probably not without reason. 'There's nothing
we Beaus take more Pride in than a Sett of Genteel Footmen.
I never have any but what wear their own Hair, and I allow
em a Crown a Week for Gloves and Powder; if one shouldn't,
they'd Steal horridly to set themselves out, for now, not one in

ten is without a Watch, and a nice Snuff Box with the best
Orangerie; and the Liberty of the Upper Gallery, has made
'em so confounded pert, that, as they wait behind one at Table,
they'll either put in their Word, or Mimick a body, and People
must bear with 'em or else pay 'em their Wages.'  Steele, of
course, could not resist such a tempting theme for his pen,
and, consequently, devotes a whole Spectator (No. 88) to
footmen. He says: 'They are but in a lower Degree what
their Masters themselves are ; and usually affect an Imitation
of their Manners; and you have in Liveries, Beaux, Fops, and
Coxcombs, in as high perfection, as among People that keep
Equipages. It is a common Humour among the Retinue of
People of Quality, when they are in their Revels, that is when
they are out of their Master's Sight, to assume in a humourous
Way the Names and Titles of those whose Liveries they wear.'
    Indeed, the footmen of that age must have had a good
time of it, for the custom of feeing them, or, as it was called,
of giving them 'vails,' was very prevalent. It got worse later
on-indeed, it became such a nuisance that it was obliged to be
stopped. Yet even now it has to be done, like feeing waiters.
Certainly their wages were not great. 'I love punctual
Dealings, Sir; Now my Wages comes to at Six Pound per
Annum, Thirty two Pounds the Five Years and four Months,
the odd Week two Shillings Sixpence, the two Hours one half-
penny,' etc.2 This, certainly, even at the then enhanced value of
money, was not a great yearly wage, and to a certain extent
must plead excuse for the custom of giving vails. As a rule
they were treated like dogs by their masters, and were caned
mercilessly for very trivial faults. They were very far from
being faultless, and Swift's man Patrick seems to have been a
specimen of his kind. How humorously Swift used to describe
his faults to Stella! how he was always going to get rid of
him, and never did!
    Their liveries were, perhaps, not so gorgeous as in the later
Georgian time, but they liked fine clothes. 'Her footmen, as
I told you before, are such Beaus, that I do not much care for
asking them Questions; when I do, they answer me with a
sawcy Frown, and say that every thing, which I find fault with,

was done by my Lady Mary's Order. She tells me that she
intends they shall wear Swords with their next Liveries, having
lately observed the Footmen of two or three Persons of Quality
hanging behind the Coach with Swords by their Sides.'1
   One part of their duty was to call on their master's or
mistress's acquaintances, and ask, with their compliments,
' How do ye ? '--equivalent to our sending in a card; and this
custom is frequently mentioned in contemporary literature.
'And I'll undertake, if the How d'ye Servants of our Women
were to make a Weekly Bill of Sickness,' &amp;c.,2 'While she
sleeps I'm Employ'd in Howdee's,'3 'We have so many come
with How-dee's, I never mind 'em.'
   The upper gallery at the play was theirs by prescriptive
right; their verdict greatly influenced the success or failure of
a play, and they were worth conciliating. Pinkethman, who
played to the gallery, knew this, and in Mrs. Centlivre's comedy
of' The Basset Table,' where he took a footman's part, spoke
the prologue, in which he not only addressed them in preference
to the other portion of the audience, but showed his power
over them by making them rattle their sticks and clap their
hands at his command.

      Therefore dear Brethren (since I am one of you)
      Whether adorn'd in Grey, Green, Brown or Blue,
      This day stand all by me, as I will fall by you;

   Whilst waiting in the House of Commons, as alluded to
in the foregoing, the footmen used to form a parliament of
their own, and discussed politics like their masters. As a
joke upon the poverty of the Scotch lords, it used to be said
that, in the footmen's House of Lords, many questions were
lost to the court party, which were carried in the real House,
owing to there being so few footmen belonging to them.
Swift alludes to this practice 1 : ' Pompey, Colonel Hill's black,
designs to stand speaker for the footmen. I am engaged to
use my interest for him, and have spoken to Patrick to get
him some votes.'
   'Give you a lucky Hit' shows that the spirit of Chawles
Jeames Yellow Plush was then in existence, and that he some-
times speculated; and, if the following newspaper paragraph is
reliable, he sometimes won: and would be in a position to
realise the last line in the prologue: 'The Ticket which
entitled the Bearer to 10,000l. drawn in this present Lottery,
belongs to a Brewer's Man and Maid Servant.' 2
   The accomplishments of male servants seem to have been
varied. Addison says,3 'I remember the time when some of
our well-bred Country Women kept their Valet de Chambre,
because, forsooth, a Man was much more handy about them
than one of their own Sex. I myself have seen one of these
Male Abigails tripping about the Room with a looking glass
in his Hand, and combing his Lady's Hair a whole Morning
together.' And another of the fraternity advertises thus: 'A
likely sober Person, who can give a very good Account of
himself, by several Gentlemen and others: He has a Mind to
serve a Gentleman as a Valet de Chambre or Buttler; or to
wait on a single Gentleman in Town or Country; he is known to
shave well, and can make Wigs; he well understands the Prac-
tice of Surgery, which may be of great Use to a Family in the
Country or elsewhere; he is a Sportsman; he understands
shooting flying, Hunting and Fishing, and all other Sports
relating thereunto; he well understands a Horse.'
    But (and it is a curious little revelation of social life) men
did not monopolise the position of body servants to their
      1 Journal to Stella, letter 10.  2 Postboy, Jan. 21/23, 1714.
                       3 Spectator, No. 45.

masters. Steele, writing as Isaac Bickerstaff, about his club,
says 1: 'This may suffice to give the world a taste of our
innocent conversation, which we spun out until about ten
of the clock, when my maid came with a lantern to light
me home.'
    There was, however, another class of servants-black
slaves; for the children of Ham were still in their cruel
bondage here-and many are the advertisements respecting
them, from 'a parcel of beads for the Guinea trade' to a
'Mulatto Maid missing.' It seems curious to us, now, to think
of the somewhat inconsequent behaviour of those times,
keeping black slaves with one hand, and redeeming white ones
from Barbary with the other. One thing is, the poor whites
only changed their method of slavery, for they were draughted
into the navy, and in the long war that followed, there was very
little hope of their release. The papers of March 10, 1702,
tell of 143 out of 190 of these poor wretches going to St.
Paul's, where the Bishop of London gave them 70l. between
them, and the dean, Dr. Sherlock, 'admonished them to return
thanks to the Government for their Deliverance, and to the
People for their Charity, and that they should not pursue the
Practices to which Sailers, &amp;c., are too much addicted, viz.
Swearing and Cursing. There are about 42 left behind, as
'tis said because some of the Powder, which was carried thither,
happened not to be Proof.' And the London Post, March
11 / 13, tells a touching little romance of this event: 'This day
the Slaves lately arrived from Barbary, went in a Body to the
Admiralty Office, in order to enter themselves on Board the
Queen's Ships; And 'twas observable, that when they came
Yesterday out of Paul's, one of them was spy'd out by 2 of
his Daughters who came thither only out of Curiosity, and so
soon as they saw their Father, run with open Arms, imbraced
and kissed him.'
   It is needless to say that the negro slaves were always
running away, and being advertised for; but, as the rewards
given were not high, it is probable that recapture was almost
certain. One or two instances will suffice: 'A Slender middle
sized India Black, in a dark grey Livery with Brass Buttons,

went from Mrs. Thwaits, in Stepney, the 4th of June, and is,
suppos'd to be gone on board some Ship in the Downs; who-
soever secures and gives notice of him to Mrs. Thwaits or
Mr. Tresham, two doors within Aldgate, shall have 10s. reward
and reasonable Charges.' 'Went away from his Master's House
in Drury Lane, upon Monday the 6th Instant, and has since
been seen at Hampstead, Highgate and Tottenham Court, an
Indian Black boy, with long Hair, about 15 Years of Age,
speaks very good English; he went away in a brown Fustian
Frock, a blew Wastecoate, and scarlet Shag Breeches, and is
called by the name of Morat; Whoever brings him to, or gives
Notice of him, so as he may be brought to Mr. Pain's House in
Prince's Court, Westminster, shall have a Guinea Reward, and
the Boy shall be kindly received.' Judging by his 'long Hair,'
this boy was not a negro-indeed it would seem that it only
needed a dark skin to constitute a slave; for 'an East India
young man, named Caesar,' ran away. 'A Negro Maid, aged
about 16 Years, much pitted with the Small Pox, speaks
English well, having a piece of her left Ear bit off by a Dog;
She hath on a strip'd Stuff Wastcoat and Petticoat . . . they
shall have a Guinea Reward and reasonable Charges.' Some-
times (indeed it was rather fashionable) the poor wretches
had collars round their necks. 'A Tall Negro young fellow
commonly known as Jack Chelsea, having a Collar about his
Neck (unless it be lately filed off), with these Words; Mr.
Moses Goodyeare of Chelsea his Negro, ran away from his
Master last Tuesday evening.' This habit of wearing collars
is noticed by Steele, 1 who inserts a letter from 'a blackamoor
boy-Pompey.' ' Besides this, the shock dog has a collar
that cost almost as much as mine.' Sometimes these collars
were of silver. 'Run away from his Master about a Fortnight
since, a lusty Negroe Boy about 18 years of Age, full of pock
holes, had a Silver Collar about his Neck engrav'd Capt. Tho.
Mitchel's Negroe, living in Griffith Street in Shadwel.'
   They were rarely advertised to be sold-indeed, I have
only found one instance in all the newspapers of the twelve
years of Anne's reign, and that is very simple. 'A Negro
boy about 12 years of age, that speaks English, is to be sold.

   Another kind of servant must not be forgotten, although
his servitude was but a limited one-and that is the ap-
prentice, of whom Misson says: ' An Apprentice is a sort of a
Slave; he wears neither Hat nor Cap in his Master's presence;
he can't marry, nor lave any Dealings on his own Account.
All he earns is his Masters.' Misson is slightly in error in
one part of this description, but it is a piece of delicate etiquette,
which probably escaped a foreigner's eye: the apprentice
might wear his cap in his master's presence during the last
year of his time. A branch of industry then existed-
although probably it was practised by very few:-'Attendance
will be given at the Sun Coffee House in Queen Street, very
near Cheapside, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, where
Youth may be furnished with Masters to go Apprentices to
Merchants, Wholesale or Retale Trades, or Handicraft Trades.'

PASSING to the social habits of the people, it is difficult where
to commence the description. The men of the time were
humdrum and prosaic-they went nowhere, at least accord-
ing to our ideas-a journey to York, or so, was really fraught
with peril and hardship, consequently no one ever moved
about unless they were compelled. The suburbs were sparsely
inhabited, and there was nothing much to see when one got
there, except at Hampstead or Highgate. 'Your Glass
Coach will go to Hide Park for Air. The Suburb fools trudge
to Lambs Conduit or Totnam; your sprucer sort of citizen
gallop to Epsom, your Meckanick gross Fellows, showing
much conjugal affection, strut before their wives, each with a
Child in his Arms, to Islington or Hogsdon.' 1 What a
suburban holiday was like we may see in the following descrip-
tion, which, however, is somewhat condensed and revised: 2
'Fearing Time should be Elaps'd and cut short our intended

another their Accoutrements. The City Beaus in Boots as

preserv'd bright in a Box of Cotton, and dazzled in the eyes
of each beholder like a piece of Looking glass; their Wastes
hoop'd round with Turkey Leather Belts, at which hung a
Bagonet, or short Scymitar, in order to cut their Mistresses
Names upon the trees of the Forest: In the right Hand a
Whip, mounted against the Breast like the Scepter of a King's
Statue upon the Change, adorn'd with twisted Wiggs and
crown'd with edg'd Casters; being all over in such Prim and
Order, that you could scarce distinguish them from Gentle-
men. Amongst 'em were many Ladies of the same Quality,
ty'd up in Safeguards so be-knotted with their two penny
Taffaty, that a Man might guess by their Finery, their Fathers
to be Ribbond Weavers. We crowded along, mix'd among
the Herd, and could not but fancy the major part of the
Citizens were Scampering out of town to avoid the Horse
Plague. We mov'd forward, without any discontinuance of
our Perambulation, till we came to the Globe at Mile End,
where a Pretious Mortal made us a Short hand complement,
and gave us an Invitation to a Sir-Loine of Roast Beef, out
of which Corroborating Food we renew'd our Lives; and
strengthening our Spirits with a Flask of rare Claret, took
leave of my Friend's Acquaintance and so proceeded.
   'By this time the Road was full of Passengers, every one

would clean with his Handkerchief. In this order did we
March, like Aaron's Proselites, to Worship the Calf, till we
came to the New rais'd Fabrick call'd Mob's Hole, where the
Beast was to be Eaten. We press'd hard to get into the

the smell of Sweat, Stinking Breaths and Tobacco, I thought
there was but a few Gasps between the Place and Eternity.

Violin, two Fidlers scraping Lilla burlero, l my Lord Mayor's 2
Delight, upon a Couple of Crack'd Crowds,3 and an old Oliverian
trooper tootling upon a Trumpet.' After a rest and some
liquid refreshment, they chatted and bantered with the holiday
folk, until ' from thence went into the Kitchin, Built up of
Furzes, in the Open Air, to behold their Cookery; where the
Major part of the Calf was Roasting upon a Wooden Spit: Two
or three great Slivers he had lost off his Buttocks, his Ribs
par'd to the very Bone, with holes in his Shoulders, each large
enough to bury a Sevil Orange, that he looked as if a Kennel
of Hounds had every one had
a Snap at him. Under him lay
the Flitch of Bacon of such an
Ethiopian Complection, that I
should rather have guess'd it the
side of a Blackamore: It looking
more like a Cannibal's Feast
than a Christian Entertainment.
Being soon glutted with the view
of this unusual piece of Cookery,
we departed from thence, and
hearing a great bustle in the
Upper Room of an Outhouse,
we went up Stairs to see what
was the matter, where we found
a poor Fidler, scraping over the
tune of Now Ponder Well you Parents Dear; 4 and a
parcel of Country People Dancing and crying to 't. The
Remembrance of the Uncles Cruelty to the poor Innocent
Babes, and the Robin Red Breasts Kindness, had fix'd in
their very Looks such Signs of Sorrow and Compassion,
that their Dancing seem'd rather a Religious Worship, than
a Merry Recreation. Having thus given ourselves a Pros-

   This stay-at-home lot naturally disliked all who differed
from them; and their especial hatred, on whom all their vials

of wrath was poured out, and who provoked their most
pungent satire, was the travelled fop who had brought back
with him Continental ideas and fashions. In this matter
John Bull, until he began to move about a bit, has always
been most conservative.   Anything 'un-English' was certain
of condemnation, and of course, during the war, the French,
and all belonging to them, were especially hated.

        Our Native Speech we must forget, ere long,
        To learn the French, that much more Modish Tongue.
        Their Language smoother is, hath pretty Aires;
        But ours is Gothick, if compar'd with theirs.
        The French by Arts of smoother Insinuation,
        Are now become the Darlings of the Nation;
        His Lordship's Valet must be bred in France,
        Or else he is a Clown without Pretence :
        The English Blockheads are in Dress so coarse,
        They're fit for nothing, but to rub a Horse,
        Her Ladyship's ill-manner'd or ill-bred,
        Whose Woman, Confident, or Chamber Maid,
        Did not in France suck in her first breathed Air,
        Or did not gain hir Education there;
        Our Cooks in dressing have no Skill at all.
        They're only fit to serve an Hospital,
        Or to prepare a Dinner for a Camp;
        French Cooks are only of the Modish Stamp. 1

    These affectations offended our insularity, and, probably,
the following sketch was not at all ungenerous or uncalled
for:-
            And he who to his Fancy puts no Stop,
            Goes out a Fool, and may return a Fop;
            And after he Six Months in France has been,
            Comes home a most Accomplish'd Harlequin,
            Drest in a tawdry Suit at Paris made,
            For which he more than thrice the Value paid.
            French his Attendants, French alone his Mouth
            Can speak, his native Language is uncouth.
            If to the Ladies he does make Advance,
            His very Looks must have the Air of France,
            The English are so heavy and so dull,
            As if with Lead, not Brains, their Heads were full.
            But the brisk Frenchman, by his subtil Art,
            Soon finds Access to any Lady's Heart.

And again,1 ' Then before they can Conster and Pearse,2 they
are sent into France with sordid illiterate Creatures, call'd
Dry'd Nurses, or Governours; Engines of as little use as
Pacing Saddles, and as unfit to Govern 'em as the Post
Horses they ride to Paris on; From whence they return
with a little smattering of that mighty Universal Language,
without being ever able to write true English.'
    If these descriptions be true, and they are so numerous
and widely scattered as to leave little doubt of it, the young
fellow came back a fribble, an emasculated nothing, except
as regards his periwig, his clothes, and his snuff-box.

dears says, 10 'Sir-You Kiss Pleasingly-I love to Kiss a
Man, in Paris we kiss nothing else.'
   What was their life composed of, and how did they spend
it ?  Naturally they got up late, breakfasted en deshabille,
held a sort of levee, till it was time to go to White's or the
Cocoa Tree, or else lounged in the Mall, where Ward de-
scribes the scene as 'It seem'd to me as if the World was

down to the Exchange to buy a pair of gloves or a sword knot,
and, under any circumstances, to ogle the shop girls. Ward's
language may be a little rough, but it is sound, and it touches
one of the social cankers of the day. Then dinner at Pontac's,
or some ordinary; then a little more coffee-house, and a wind
up at some side box-favourite haunt of beaus-at the play,
where probably other of the jeunesse doree-this time those
who had received a home education-would arrive; would-be
men-about-town,things of sixteen years old or so-whose future
development would be first Mohock, then sot:1 'Such as
come Drunk and Screaming into a Play House, and stand upon
the Benches, and toss their full Perriwigs and empty Heads,
and with their shrill unbroken Pipes, cry Dam me, this is a
Damn'd Play.' A little Tunbridge or Bath in the season,
and this was the sum of their existence, which, if the money
held out, lasted until they either physically rotted, or settled
down to married life! sated and blase;, or, if it was soon
spent, and the brilliant meteor had flashed its course across
the heavens, there was nothing but the living death of the

AND how did the women fare? We have seen that among
the middle classes the domestic virtues were encouraged
and highly extolled, and to be a 'notable housewife' was a
legitimate and proper ambition; but how did the fine-lady
class spend their time? Were their lives more usefully em-
ployed than those of the beaus ? Addison says that he re-
members the time when ladies received visits in bed, and thus
graphically describes the custom : ' It was then looked upon
as a piece of Ill breeding for a Woman to refuse to see a Man,
because she was not stirring; and a Porter would have been
thought unfit for his Place, that could have made so awkward
an Excuse. As I love to see everything that is new, I once
prevailed upon my Friend Will Honeycomb to carry me along
with him to one of these Travelled Ladies, desiring him at the
same time, to present me as a Foreigner who could not speak
English, so that I might not be obliged to bear a Part in the
Discourse. The Lady, tho' willing to appear undrest, had put
on her best Looks, and painted herself for our Reception. Her
Hair appeared in a very nice Disorder, as the Night Gown
which was thrown upon her Shoulders was ruffled with great
Care.'

proper 2--which, though undated, bears internal evidence

of the time of its birth, which gives an account of a fine
lady's life.
   'How do you employ your time now ?'
   'I lie in Bed till Noon, dress all the Afternoon, Dine in
the Evening, and play at Cards till Midnight.'
   'How do you spend the Sabbath ?'
   'In Chit Chat.'
   'What do you talk of?'
   ' New Fashions and New Plays.'
   'How often do you go to Church?'
   'Twice a year or oftener, according as my Husband gives
me new Cloaths.'
   'Why do you go to Church when you have new Cloaths ?'
   'To see other Peoples Finery, and to show my own, and
to laugh at those scurvy, out of fashion Creatures that come
there for Devotion.'
   'Pray, Madam, what Books do you read?'
   'I read lewd Plays and winning Romances.'
   'Who is it you love?'
   'Myself.'
   'What! nobody else?'
   'My Page, my Monkey, and my Lap Dog.'
   'Why do you love them?'
   'Why, because I am an English Lady, and they are Foreign
Creatures; my Page from Genoa, my Monkey from the East
Indies, and my Lap Dog from Vigo.'1
   'Would not they have pleased you as well if they had been
English ?'
   'No, for I hate everything that Old England brings forth,
except it be the temper of an English Husband, and the liberty
of an English wife; I love the French Bread, French Wines,
French Sauces, and a French Cook; in short, I have all about
me French or Foreign, from my Waiting Woman to my Parrot.'
   And Addison tells much the same story when he gives a
portion of the diary of a lady of quality.2

my Lover's Name began with a G. Mem. The Conjurer was

   Virtually, these two different versions of how an idle
woman passed her time agree remarkably well, and they let
a whole flood of daylight into the inner life of the time-on
what they breakfasted, when they dined, what time the opera
began, etc. Apart from opera, the play, and cards, how were
the females of the middle class to amuse themselves of an
evening? Say they had been busy all day, the evenings
had to be passed somehow. There was very little of that
domesticity and home life of which we are so proud, for the
men spent their evenings at their club, their coffee-house, the
tavern, or the play, so they had to amuse themselves with
such innocent games as hot cockles, questions and commands,
mottoes, similes, cross purposes, blindman's buff, and a game
called 'Parson has lost his Cloak,' or else 'Bouts rimes,'
which consisted of giving four terminal words of any kind
so that they rhymed, and then some one else filling up
the blank lines, and making four lines of sensible poetry.2
In fact, just the same amusements that are now com-
pelled to be resorted to as pastimes in a village home. The
better class had musical evenings, for chamber music was
popular, but the spinets and harpsichords were of moderate
compass, and very slight in sound. They danced country
dances too, any quantity of them; and there was the curse
of the age-cards-as a never-failing resource.
    The women did not walk much. Swift seems to think
 they did; but then a little walking went a long way with him.
 He quite boasts of his walk from and to Chelsea of a day, a
 good two-mile walk each way, as somewhat of a feat, and he

repeatedly grumbles at Stella for not walking more-tells her
to knock off her claret and buy a pair of good strong boots
and use them.1 'When I pass the Mall in the evening it is
prodigious to see the number of ladies walking there; and I
always cry shame at the ladies of Ireland, who never walk at
all, as if their legs were of no use, but to be laid aside. ... I
tell you what, if I was with you, when we went to Stoyte, at
Donnybrook, we would only take a coach to the hither end
of Stephen's Green, and from thence go every step on foot;
yes, faith, every step.'
   The Mall was the fashionable lounge, or the Parade,
where smoking was not allowed.2 'From thence we walk'd
into the Parade, which my Friend told me us'd, in a Morning,
to be cover'd with the Bones of Red Herrings, and smelt as
strong about Breakfast Times as a Wet Salter's Shop at Mid-
summer. But now, says he, its perfum'd again with English
Breath; and the scent of Oroonoko Tobacco no more offends
the Nostrils of our squeamish Ladies.' And there were the
lucks to feed on the canal. But the Mall was the place.
Ward goes into ecstasies over it: never was there such a
sight. 'From thence we went thro' the Pallace into the Park
about the time when the Court Ladies raise their extended
Limbs from their downy Couches, and Walk into the Mall to
refresh their charming Bodies with the Cooling and Salubrious
Breezes of the Gilded Evening. We could not possibly have
chose a Luckier Minute to have seen the delightful Park in its
greatest Glory and Perfection; for the brightest Stars of the
Creation sure (that shine by no other Power than humane
Excellence) were moving here with such awful State and
Majesty that their Graceful Deportments bespoke 'em God-
desses,' etc.
   Of course they paid visits-how could women live without
a little gossip ? The invaluable Misson takes a note of the prac-
tice. ' Persons of the first Quality visit one another in England
as much as we do in France, generally about Evening; but the
ordinary Sort of People have not that Custom. Among us all
the little Shopkeepers, particularly the Women, go with their
Gowns about their Heels to visit one another by Turns, either

to crack and bounce to one another, or else to sit with their
Arms a cross, and say nothing. What can be more tedious,
impertinent, and ridiculous than such Visits ? Here, Persons
of that Condition go to see one another with their Work in
their Hands and Chearfulness in their Countenance, without
Rule or Constraint. Upon certain Occasions, as upon Mourning
or Marriage, they pay one another Visits of Ceremony.' Brown
gives a most amusing description 1 of 'the City Ladies Visiting
Day, which is a familiar Assembly, or a general Council, of the
fair and charming Sex, where all the important affairs of their
Neighbours are largely discuss'd, but judg'd in an arbitrary



















manner, without hearing the Parties speak for themselves.
Nothing comes amiss to these Tribunals; matters of high and
no consequence, as Religion and Cuckoldom, Commodes and
Sermons, Politicks and Gallantry, Receipts of Cookery and
Scandal, Coquetry and Preserving, Jilting and Laundry; in
short, every thing is subject to the Jurisdiction of this Court,
and no Appeal lies from it. The Coach stops at the Gold-
smith's or Mercer's Door, and off leaps Mr. Skip Kennel from
behind it, and makes his Address to the Book Keeper or
Prentice, and asks if his Lady (for that is always the name of
        1 The Works of Thomas Brown, ed. 1708, vol. iii p. 86.

the Mistress) receives any Visits that day or No; some stay
must be made till the Woman above stairs sends down her
Answer, and then the Pink of Courtesie is receiv'd at the top
of the Stairs, like King James by the French King, and handed
to her stool of discourse...  Thus they take a sip of Tea,
then for a draught or two of Scandal to digest it, next let it
be Ratafia, or any other Favourite Liquor, Scandal must be
the after draught to make it sit easie on their Stomach, till the
half hour's past, and they have disburthen'd themselves of
their Secrets, and take Coach for some other place to collect
new matter for Defamation.'
   Tea was then in its infancy, but it was an extremely
fashionable beverage, in spite of its expense, and the tea-
table was the very centre of scandal and gossip.
       How see we Scandal (for our sex too base),
       Seat in dread Empire in the Female Race,
       'Mong Beaus and Women, Fans and Mechlin Lace,
       Chief seat of Slander, Ever there we see
       Thick Scandal circulate with right Bohea.

       And at each Sip a Lady's Honour dies;
       Truth rare as Silence, or a Negro Swan,
       Appears among those Daughters of the Fan.

    Naturally, when out walking they did a little shopping,
                                      or what passed as such;
                                      for then, as now, many
                                      a fine lady would go
                                      into a shop and look at
                                      the goods simply to pass

dear Sir, one of the top China Women about Town; and
though I say it, keep as good Things and receive as fine
Company as any o' this End of the Town, let the other
be who she will.   In short I am in a fair Way to be
easy, were it not for a Club of Female Rakes who, under
pretence of taking their innocent rambles, forsooth, and
diverting the Spleen, seldom fail to plague me twice or
thrice a day to cheapen Tea, or buy a Skreen.  What
else should they mean ? as they often repeat it. These Rakes
are your idle Ladies of Fashion, who having nothing to do
employ themselves in tumbling over my Ware. One of these
No Customers (for, by the way, they seldom or never buy any-
thing) calls for a set of Tea Dishes, another for a Bason, a third
for my best Green Tea, and even to the Punch bowl; there's
scarce a piece in my Shop but must be displaced, and the
whole agreeable Architecture disordered, so that I can compare
'em to nothing but to the Night Goblins that take a Pleasure
to overturn the Disposition of Plates and Dishes in the kitchens
of your housewifely Maids. Well, after all this Racket and
Clutter, this is too dear, that is their Aversion; another thing
is Charming, but not wanted. The Ladies are cured of the
Spleen, but I am not a Shilling the better for it.'
   One famous place for shopping was the New Exchange,
in the Strand, which must have been something like our
arcades; and many are the allusions, in contemporary litera-
ture, to the dangerous allurements of the Exchange shop-
girls.  'Did you buy anything?  Some Bawbles. But my
choice was so distracted among the Pretty Merchants and
their Dealers, I knew not where to run first. One little lisping
Rogue, Ribbandths, Gloveths, Tippeths. Sir, cries another,
will you buy a fine Sword Knot; then a third, pretty voice
and Curtsie, Does not your Lady want Hoods, Scarfs, fine
green silk Stockings. I went by as if I had been in a Seraglio,
a living Gallery of Beauties-staring from side to side, I
bowing, they laughing; so made my escape.' 1
   This was the universal description of the New Exchange,
and the character of their wares has been immortalised in a
song by Ward :-

   Another female practice, then, was to go to daily service
at church especially-and St. Paul's, Covent Garden, was a
very fashionable church at which to worship, or ogle the
beaus. 1 'This Market and that Church,' says my friend,
'hides more faults of kind Wives and Daughters among the
Neighbouring Inhabitants than the pretended Visits either to
my Cousin at t'other end of the Town, or some other distant
Acquaintance; for if the Husband asks, Where have you been,
Wife ? or the Parent, Where have you been, Daughter ? the
Answer, if it be after Eleven in the forenoon, or between Three
and Four in the Afternoon, is, At Prayers. But, if early in the
Morning, then their excuse is, I took a walk to Covent Garden
Market, not being very well, to refresh myself with the scent
of the Herbs and Flowers; Bringing a Flower, or a Sprig of
Sweet Bryar, home in her Hand, and it confirms the matter.'
   When not walking, ladies used either a coach or a sedan
chair, and but seldom rode on horseback; but, when they did
so, they generally preferred the pillion to the side-saddle, as

in the accompanying illustration, and held on by the belt
either of her cavalier or groom.
   In the country, horse exercise was much more in vogue,
and Swift repeatedly alludes to, and reminds Stella of, her
riding. When riding, ladies very frequently wore masks to
protect the countenance from the rays of the sun.
    Frequent allusions are made to a lady's pets, her lap-dog
or her parrot; but very few people know the very wide range
of choice she had in the selection of those pets. Needless to
say there were monkeys, both Marmoset and other kinds;
there were paroquets, paroquets of Guinea, cockatoos and
macaws, scarlet nightingales from the West Indies, lorries
or lurries, canaries, both ash and lemon colour, white and
grey turtle doves from Barbary, white turtle doves, and the
turtle doves from Moco, no bigger than a lark, spotted very
fine.  There were milk-white peacocks,
white and pyed pheasants, bantams, and
furbelow fowls from the East Indies, and
top-knot hens from Hamburg. She would
hardly want the 'Parcel of living Vipers,
fresh taken, fat and good, are to be sold
by the dozen,' nor would she care about
the 'fine Tyger from the East Indies, who
was brought over together with some fine
geese from the same part of the world,' and
some 'Amedawares.' In fact there were
'Jamrachs' then as now, and many of the bird shops were
in St. Martin's Lane, near which locality they still abound.
There is a curious advertisement in the Postman, January
12/15, 1706, which settles the date of bird-seed glasses
'The so much approved and most convenient new fashion
Crystal Bird Glasses, which effectually prevent the Littering
of the Seeds into the Rooms.'
   An innocent amusement, of which they were very fond,
was dancing. And of dances there were a considerable
quantity: country dances and jigs, of which there was an
infinite variety, and minuets, rigadoons, and other more
stately and stagey dances, as the 'Louvre and the French
Brittagne.' These latter were elaborate, and absolutely in-

augurated a fresh literature devoted to their cult. This seems
to have been started by one Thoinet Arbeau, in a book pub-
lished by him in 1588, and he may be called the originator
of the ballet. Both Beauchamp and Feuillet wrote on this
subject in French. Feuillet's book was translated and im-
proved upon by Siris, in 1706. John Weaver wrote on this
subject (in his ' Orchesography') about 1708, and John Essex
(in the 'Treatise of Chorography') in 1710. The object was
to teach the different steps and dances, by means of diagrams.
Thus coupees, bourees, fleurets, bounds or tacs, contretemps,
chasses, sissones, pirouettes, capers, entrechats, etc., all had
their distinguishing marks.
   The effect of learning by this method is whimsically given
by Addison.1 'I was this morning awakened by a sudden












shake of the house, and as soon as I had got a little out of
my consternation I felt another, which was followed by two
or three repetitions of the same convulsion. I got up as fast
as possible, girt on my rapier, and snatched up my hat, when
my landlady came up to me and told me "that the gentle-
woman of the next house begged me to step thither, for that
a lodger she had taken in was run mad, and she desired my
advice," as indeed everybody in the whole lane does upon
important occasions. I am not like some artists, saucy, be-
cause I can be beneficial, but went immediately. Our neigh-
bour told us " she had the day before let her second floor to a
very genteel youngish man, who told her he kept extra-
ordinary good hours, and was generally home most part of
                     1 The Tater, No. 88.

the morning and evening at study; but that this morning he
had for an hour together made this extravagant noise which
we then heard." I went up stairs with my hand upon the hilt
of my rapier, and approached this new lodger's door.
   'I looked in at the keyhole, and there I saw a well made
man look with great attention on a book, and on a sudden
jump into the air so high, that his head almost touched the
ceiling.  He came down safe on his right foot, and again
flew up, alighting on his left; then looked again at his book,
and holding out his right leg, put it into such a quivering
motion, that I thought he would have shaked it off. He then
used the left after the same manner, when on a sudden, to my
great surprise, he stooped himself incredibly low, and turned
gently on his toes. After this circular motion, he continued
bent in that humble posture for some time, looking on his
book. After this, he recovered himself with a sudden spring,
and flew round the room in all the violence and disorder
imaginable, until he made a full pause for want of breath.
   'In this interim, my women asked "what I thought." I
whispered, " that I thought this learned person an enthusiast,
who possibly had his first education in the Peripatetic way,
which was a sect of Philosophers, who always studied when
walking." But observing him much out of breath, I thought
it the best time to master him if he were disordered, and
knocked at his door. I was surprized to find him open it,
and say with great civility and good mien, " that he hoped he
had not disturbed us." I believed him in a lucid interval, and
desired "he would please to let me see his book." He did so,
smiling.  I could not make anything of it, and therefore
asked " in what language it was writ." He said, " it was one
he studied with great application; that it was his profession
to teach it, and he could not communicate his knowledge
without a consideration." I answered " that I hoped he would
hereafter keep his thoughts to himself, for his meditation this
morning had cost me three coffee dishes, and a clean pipe."
He seemed concerned at that, and told me " he was a dancing
master, and had been reading a dance or two before he went
out, which had been written by one who had been taught at
an Academy in France." He observed me at a stand, and

went on to inform me, "that now Articulate MOTIONS as
well as SOUNDS were expressed byProper CHARACTERS,
and that there is nothing so common as to communicate a
Dance by a letter." I besought him hereafter to meditate in
a ground room.'
   The public dancers were utilised in rather a curious way,
if we may credit Mrs. Centlivre-who certainly ought to
know. She says, in 'Love at a Venture,' ' Sir Paul Cautious,
Go to the Play House, and desire some of the Singers and
Dancers to come hither,' and the servant, later on in the
play, announces 'The Singers and Dancers are come, Sir.

BUT primest and chief delight of men and women in this
age was CARDS. Never, perhaps, was such a card-playing
time-certainly not in England. Ombre, which is so vividly
described in the third canto of the 'Rape of the Lock,' was a
game which could be played by two, three, or five persons-
generally by three; to each of whom nine cards were dealt.
It takes its name from the Spanish, the person who under-
took to stand the game making use of the words ' Yo soy
l'hombre,' 'I am the man.' It was an improvement on Primero,
which disappeared after its introduction. L'hombre is still
played in Spain under the name of Tresillo, and in Spanish
America it is called Rocambor. Piquet is now played. Basset
was a very gambling game, closely resembling the modern
Faro; Whisk or Whist, Brag, Lanterloo, or Lanctre loo, in which
pam, or the knave of clubs, is the highest card :1 'Were
she at her Parish Church, in the Height of her Devotion,
should any Body in the Interim but stand at the Church
Door and hold up the Knave of Clubs, she would take it to
be a Challenge at Lanctre Loo; and starting from her prayers,
would follow her beloved Pam, as a deluded Traveller does
an Ignis Fatuus'; and One and Thirty, which does not seem
a very extravagant game, judging by Swift's account of it. 2

'Lord Treasurer has had an ugly fit of the rheumatism,
but is now near quite well. I was playing at one and thirty
with him and his family the other night. He gave us all
twelvepence apiece to begin with.' These were some of the
games 1 they delighted in; and the accompanying illustra-
tion very vividly brings before us a quiet and pleasant game
at cards.
   The implements of gaming, the cards themselves, were
much smaller and thinner than those we are accustomed to
play with. They were not always confined to the prosaic
display of the pips and Court cards, as ours are, but took a
far more fanciful flight. 'Geographical, Geometrical, Astro-

tories of Marlborough and other events in Anne's reign;
Sacheverel cards; and anything for fashion-cards from
Vigo-in 1702-after the great victory there; proverb cards;
all kinds of cards. The ordinary playing cards were cheap
enough in all conscience, 'the best Principal superfine Picket
Cards at 2s. 6d. a Dozen; the best Principal superfine Ombro
Cards at 2s. 9d. a dozen; the best Principal superfine Basset
Cards at 3s 6d. a dozen' (packs understood). The price to

cards, costly colours, bon ace, putt, plain dealing, Queen Nazareen, pennech,
post and pair, bankafalat, beast.

retailers averaged 1 1/2 d. per pack, and it is marvellous how
they could, at that time, be made for the money.
   By an Act of 10 Anne, c. 18, s. 176, etc., a duty of six-
pence per pack for cards, and five shillings a pair for dice,
was imposed; and all cards made and unsold before June 12,
1711, were to be brought in to be stamped, and pay a duty
of one halfpenny per pack, and dice 6d. a pair.
   The passion of women for gambling was a fruitful theme
for satire in those days.  ' She's a profuse Lady, tho' of a
Miserly Temper, whose Covetous Disposition is the very Cause
of her Extravagancy; for the Desire of Success wheedles
her Ladyship to play, and the incident Charges and Dis-
appointments that attend it, make her as expensive to her
Husband, as his Coach and six Horses. When an unfortunate
Night has happen'd to empty her Cabinet, she has many
Shifts to replenish her Pockets.  Her Jewels are carry'd
privately into Lombard Street, and Fortune is to be tempted
the next Night with another Sum, borrowed of my Lady's
Goldsmith at the Extortion of a Pawnbroker; and if that
fails, then she sells off her Wardrobe, to the great grief of her
Maids ; stretches her Credit amongst those she deals with, or
makes her Waiting Woman dive into the Bottom of her
Trunk, and lug out her green Net Purse full of old Jacobuses,
in Hopes to recover her losses by a Turn of Fortune, that
she may conceal her bad Luck from the Knowledge of her
Husband.' 1
   Nay, worse subterfuges than these are more than openly
hinted at in divers authors. One or two examples will
suffice.
           This Itch for play has likewise fatal been,
           And more than Cupid draws the Ladies in,
           A Thousand Guineas for Basset prevails,
           A Bait when Cash runs low, that seldom fails;
           And when the Fair One can't the Debt defray
           In Sterling Coin, does Sterling Beauty pay.2

That Women can imagine all Household Care, regard to
Posterity, and fear of Poverty, must be sacrificed to a game
at Cards.'
   But we must not think that the fair ones monopolised the
enjoyment of this passion-the sterner sex were equally
culpable.  Gaming houses were plentiful.  The ' Groom
Porter's' was still in full swing, vide this advertisement:l
'Whereas Her Majesty, by her Letters Patent to Thomas
Archer Esq. constituting him Her Groom Porter, hath given
full Power to him and such Deputies as he shall appoint, to
supervise, regulate, and authorize (by and under the Rules,
Conditions and Restrictions by the Law prescribed) all
manner of Gaming within this Kingdom. And, whereas
several of Her Majesty's Subjects, keeping Plays or Games in
their Houses, have been lately abused, and had Moneys
extorted from them by several ill disposed Persons, contrary
to Law. These are therefore to give Notice, That no Person
whatsoever, not producing his Authority from the said Groom
Porter, under the Seal of his Office, hath any Power to act
anything under the said Patent. And to the end that all
such Persons offending as aforesaid may be proceeded against
according to Law, it is hereby desired, that Notice be given
of all such Abuses to the said Groom Porter, or his Deputies,
at his Office at Mr. Stephenson's, a Scrivener's House, over
against Old Man's Coffee House near Whitehall.'
   The Groom Porter's own Gaming House must have been
the scene of brawls.2

   Sir Geo. Airy. Oh, I honour Men of the Sword; and I presume this
Gentleman is lately come from Spain or Portugal-by his Scars.
   Marplot. No, really, Sir George, mine sprung from civil Fury:
Happening last night into the Groom Porter's-I had a strong Inclina-
tion to go ten Guineas with a sort of a-sort of a-kind of a Milk Sop,
as I thought; A Pox of the Dice, he flung out, and my Pockets being
empty, as Charles knows they sometimes are, he prov'd a Surly North
Briton, and broke my face for my Deficiency.

   If scenes like this were enacted at the Groom Porter's,
what must have taken place at the other gaming houses ?

Let two contemporary writers, whose language, though rough,
is trustworthy, answer the question. 'Gaming is an Estate
to which all the World has a Pretence, tho' few espouse it








































that are willing to keep either their Estates, or Reputations.
I knew two Middlesex Sharpers not long ago, that inherited
a West Country Gentleman's Estate, who I believe, wou'd

have never made them   his Heirs in his last Will and
Testament.
   'Lantrillou is a kind of a Republick very ill ordered,
where all the World are Hail Fellow well met; no distinction
of Ranks, no Subordination observed. The greatest Scoundrel
of the Town, with Money in his Pockets, shall take his Turn
before the best Duke or Peer in the Land, if the Cards are on
his side. From these Privileg'd Places not only all Respect
and Inferiority is Banish'd; but every thing that looks like
Good Manners, Compassion, or Humanity: Their Hearts are
so Hard and Obdurate, that what occasions the Grief of one
Man, gives Joy and Satisfaction to his next Neighbour. ...
'In some Places they call Gaming Houses Academies;
but I know not why they should inherit that Honourable
Name, since there's nothing to be learn'd there, unless it be
Slight of Hand, which is sometimes at the Expence of all our
Money, to get that of other Men's by Fraud and Cunning.
The Persons that meet are generally Men of an Infamous
Character, and are in various Shapes, Habits and Employ-
ments. Sometimes they are Squires of the Pad, and now
and then borrow a little Money upon the King's High Way,
to recruit their losses at the Gaming House, and when a Hue
and Cry is out, to apprehend them, they are as safe in one of
these Houses as a Priest at the Altar, and practise the old
trade of Cross biting Cullies, assisting the Frail Square Dye
with high and low Fullums, and other Napping Tricks, in
comparison of whom the common Bulkers, and Pickpockets,
are a very honest Society. How unaccountable is this way
to Beggary, that when a Man has but a little Money, and
knows not where in the World to compass any more, unless
by hazarding his Neck for 't, will try an Experiment to leave
himself none at all: Or, he that has Money of his own, should
play the Fool, and try whether it shall not be another Man's.
Was ever any thing so Nonsensically Pleasant?
   'One idle day I ventur'd into one of these Gaming Houses,
where I found an Oglio of Rakes of several Humours, and
Conditions met together. Some that had left them never a
Penny to bless their Heads with. One that had play'd away
even his Shirt and Cravat, and all his Clothes but his

Breeches, stood shivering in a Corner of the Room, and
another comforting him, and saying, Damme Jack, who ever
thought to see thee in a State of Innocency: Cheer up,
Nakedness is the best Receipt in the World against a Fever;
and then fell a Ranting, as if Hell had broke loose that very
Moment. ... I told my friend, instead of Academies these
places should be call'd Cheating Houses: Whereupon a Bully
of the Blade came strutting up to my very Nose, in such a
Fury, that I would willingly have given half the Teeth in my
Head for a Composition, crying out, Split my Wind Pipe,
Sir, you are a Fool, and don't understand Trap, the whole
World's a Cheat.'
   Ward,2 also, writing of gaming, says: 'Pray, said I, what
do you take those Knot of Gentlemen to be, who are so
Merry with one another?  They, reply'd my Friend, are
Gamesters, waiting to pick up some young Bubble or other as
he comes from his Chamber; they are Men whose Conditions
are subject to more Revolutions than a Weather Cock, or the
Uncertain Mind of a Fantastical Woman. They are seldom
two Days in one and the same Stations, they are one day
very richly drest, and perhaps out at Elbows the next; they
have often a great deal of Money, and are as often without a
Penny in their Pockets; they are as much Fortunes Bubbles,
as young Gentlemen are theirs; for whatever benefits she
bestows upon 'em with one Hand, she snatches away with
t'other; their whole Lives are a Lottery, they read no books
but Cards, and all their Mathematicks is to truly understand
the Odds of a Bet; they very often fall out, but very seldom
Fight, and the way to make 'em your Friends is to Quarrel
with them. . . . They generally begin every Year with the
same Riches; for the Issue of their Annual Labours is chiefly
to inrich the Pawnbrokers. They are seldom in Debt, be-
cause no Body will Trust 'em; and they never care to Lend
Money, because they Know not where to Borrow it. A Pair
of False Dice, and a Pack of mark'd Cards sets 'em up; and
an Hours Unfortunate Play commonly breaks 'em.'
   These professional swindlers belonged to all classes of
society, and some who died in this reign have left names

behind them: St. Evremont, Beau Fielding, Macartney, who
was Lord Mahun's second in his celebrated duel with the
Duke of Hamilton, and the Marquis de Guiscard, who stabbed
Harley, the Earl of Oxford. Their Lives, and many others,
are given by Lucas,1 from whom I shall only borrow one
example, to show the equality that play made between the
different social grades. Bourchier died in 1702, so-that he
just comes within this reign. 'Being at the Groom Porter's,
he flung one Main with the Earl of Mulgrave for 500 Pounds,
which he won; and his Honour looking wistly at him, quoth
he, I believe I shou'd know you.  Yes (reply'd the Winner)
your Lordship must have some Knowledge of me, for my Name
is Dick Bourchier, who was once your Footman. Whereupon

But the Groom Porter assuring his Lordship that Mr. Bour-
chier was able to have paid 1,000 Pounds provided his Lord-

   ' Once Mr. Bourchier going over to Flanders, with a great
Train of Servants, set off in such a fine Equipage, that they
drew the Eyes of all upon them wherever they went, to
admire the Splendor and Gaiety of their Master, whom they
look for no less than a Nobleman of the first Rank. In this
Pomp, making his Tour at K. William's Tent, he happen'd
into Play with that great Monarch, and won of him above
2,500. The Duke of Bavaria being also there, he took up
the cudgels, and losing 15,000 the Loss put him into a great
Chafe, and doubting some foul Play was put upon him, be-
cause Luck went so much against him, quoth Mr. Bourchier:
Sir, if you have any suspicion of the least Sinister Trick put
upon your Highness, if you please I'll give you a Chance for all
your Money at once, tossing up at Cross and Pile, and you shall
have the Advantage too of throwing up the Guinea yourself.

less accepting, he tost up for  15,000, and lost the Money

upon Reputation, with which Bourchier was very well satis-
fied, as not doubting in the least; and so taking his leave of
the King, and those Noblemen that were with him, he de-
parted. Then the Elector of Bavaria enquiring of his Majesty,
who that Person was, that could run the Hazard of playing
for so much Money at a time, he told him it was a subject of
his in England, that though he had no real Estate of his own,
yet was he able to play with any Sovereign Prince in Ger-
many. Shortly after Bourchier returning into England, he
bought a most rich Coach and Curious Sett of Six Horses to
it, which cost him above 3,000, for a present to the Elector
of Bavaria, who had not as yet paid him any thing of the
30,000 which he had won of him. Notice hereof being sent
to his Highness, the generous Action incited him to send
over his Gentleman of Horse into England, to take care of
this Present, which he receiv'd Kindly at Bourchier's Hands,
to whom he return'd Bills of Exchange also, drawn upon
several eminent Merchants in London, for paying what Money
he had lost with him at Play.'
   Bourchier became very rich, and purchased an estate near
Pershore, in Worcestershire, where he was buried-although
he died in London.
   The lower classes followed the example of their social
superiors, and gambled; but once only can I find such an
instance of gaming fever as the following: 1 'An Inditement is
presented against a Person in Westminster, for playing away his
Wife to another Man, which was done with her own consent.'

Honour, whatever Title he may wear.
    There was a speculating mania arising, which boded ill
 for the future. In this reign was born the 'South Sea Bubble,'
 which burst so disastrously in the next, and involved thou-
 sands in ruin. Perhaps the mildest form it took was in
 insurances. We have already glanced at the fire insurances
 in Queen Anne's time; they now began to think of life
 insurance, and the first advertisement on this subject that I
 have noticed is in 1709. 'The Office of Assurance of Money
 upon Lives is at the Rainbow Coffee House in Cornhill, where
 Men or Women may Subscribe on their own Lives for the
 benefit of their Children, or other Person's Lives for the bene-
 fit of themselves, and have them approv'd without their
 Knowledge, paying 10s. Entrance, and 10s. towards the first
 Claim for each Life, and shall have a Policy for  1,000 for
 each Life subscribed upon in the said Society. This Office
 may be proper for such Persons as have Annuities, Estates, or
 Places for Life; and for such Persons to make Assurance
 upon Lives where Debts are dubious if the Person die. This
 Office will assure Money much Cheaper per cent. than private
 Persons.' This looks very much as if it were the first life
 insurance company that was started, in lieu of private enter-
 prise; and as this is the only company that is advertised in
 Queen Anne's reign, it was probably the sole forerunner of
 the numerous similar enterprises now in existence.
    Hatton says, 'Offices that Insure Ships or their Cargo are
many about the Royal Exchange, as Mr. Hall's, Mr. Bevis's,
etc., who for a Premium paid down procure those that will
subscribe Policies for Insuring Ships (with their Cargo) bound
to or from any part of the World, the Premium being pro-
portioned to the Distance, Danger of Seas, Enemies, etc. But
in these Offices 'tis Customary upon paying the Money on a
Loss to discount 16 per cent.'
    A curious marine insurance was in existence early in
1711, of which the following is the advertisement; but it seems
a sporting insurance, and only meant to cover the war risk.
' For the Encouragement of Navigation for Masters, Mates
and other Seafaring Men that are Burnt, Sunk or Taken.

pay 5s. every Quarter or 14 days after; likewise if 4,000 per-
sons by paying 2s. 6d. for a Policy, and 2s. for the 1st if full,

Gent, in Jacob Street Southwark. Note. When 1,OOO Policies
are taken out, Trustees will be Chosen and Land Security
given. Any Person may Insure in all 3 Offices. Proposals
at large may be had at the Office. Note, that 6 per cent.
will be deducted out of the Money paid for the trouble and
charges.'
   There were besides-and they sprang up as if by magic
-insurances for everything: for marriages, for births, for
baptisms-rank swindles all.  And lotteries! why, every
thing, unsaleable otherwise, was tried to be got rid of by
lottery. The papers teemed with advertisements. Take one
newspaper haphazard; for example, the Tatler, Sept. 14/ 16,
171O: 'Mr. Stockton's Sale of Jewels, Plate, &amp;c., will be
drawn on Michaelmas Day.' ' The Lottery in Colson's Court
is to be drawn the 21st Inst.' 'The Sale of Goods to be seen
at Mrs. Butler's, &amp;c., will certainly be drawn on Tuesday the
19th Inst.' 'Mrs. Povy's Sale of Goods is put off to Saturday
23rd Inst.' 'Mrs. Symond's Sale of Goods will begin, &amp;c.,
on Wednesday the 20th of this Instant.' 'Mrs. Guthridge's
Sixpenny Sale of Goods, &amp;c., continues to be drawn every
Day.'
   The financial atmosphere was getting unwholesome,
Government had to step in, and an Act was passed which
duly appeared in the London Gazette, June 28/July I, 1712,
which enacted 'That every Person who, after the 24 June
1712, shall erect, set up, or keep any Office or Place for
making Insurance on Marriages, Births, Christnings, or

Service, or any other Office or Place, under the Denomina-

Queen's Picture, for the improving of small sums of Mony,1
or the like Offices or Places under pretence of improving
small sums of Money, shall Forfeit for every such Offence
the sum of 500l., to be recovered with full Costs of Suit, and
to be divided as aforesaid.' This had the desired effect, and
both in the British Mercury, June 27/30, 1712, and the
Postboy, Aug. 21 /23, 1712, we hear of prosecutions of illicit
lotteries-and they soon ceased.
    Of course, morally speaking, the Government had no right
to complain, for they had begun the system--by legalising a
lottery for 1,500,000 in 1709-from  which time until 1824
no year passed without Parliament sanctioning a Lottery
Bill. It is not worth while going into the schemes of the
various lotteries in Queen Anne's reign, but it may be in-
teresting to note the constitution of the one which inaugurated
an indefensible system of immoral finance, which lasted over
a century.  There were 150,000 tickets at 10 each, making
 1,500,000, the principal of which was to be sunk, and
9 per cent. to be allowed on it for 32 years. Three thousand
seven hundred and fifty tickets were prizes from 1000 to
5 per annum; the rest were blanks-a proportion of thirty-
nine to one prize, but, as a consolation, each blank was entitled
to fourteen shillings per annum during the thirty-two years.
    People rushed after the tickets, and they were taken up
at once. '21 Jan. 1710.-Yesterday books were opened at
Mercer's Chappel for receiving subscriptions for the lottery,
and, 'tis said, above a Million is already subscribed; so that,
'tis believed, 'twill be full by Monday 7 night.' 2
    And the same authority tells us 3 that 'Mr. Thomas
Barnaby, who lately belonged to the 6 clerk's office, has got
the 1000 per ann. ticket in the lottery.'
    Among the prize-holders of the next lottery (at least, so

    Here is a sample of one of these traps to catch gulls: 'At Nixon's Coffee
House, at Fetter Lane End in Fleet St, is open'd an Office call'd the Golden
Office, where by putting in Monys, not exceeding 5 Guineas, may receive Cent
per Cent in three Weeks time. Proposals may be had at the Place aforesaid.'-

nate, that my lord bestowing one ticket, which is a hundred
pounds, to one of his servants, who had been his page, the
young fellow got a prize, which has made it another
hundred.'
   In some of the lotteries the prizes were very valuable, for
we read in the Post Boy, Jan. 6/8, 1713, that 'Yesterday was
drawn No. 22858, which entitles the Bearer to 36,000.'
   The accompanying engraving shows us exactly how the
lotteries were drawn; and, as it is taken from a book pub-
lished in 1710, in all probability it is a correct representation
of the famous first State lottery of 1709. Bluecoat boys,
then, as in 1824, drew out the tickets.
   As in all lotteries, superstition attaches a peculiar value
to some number, or combination of numbers, in the ticket: so
it was in Anne's time, and the Spectator (191) comments on an
advertisement in the Post Boy of Sept. 27, 1711-' This is to
give notice, That Ten Shillings over and above the Market
Price will be given for the Ticket in the 1,500,000 Lottery

 IT is not for us to decry the superstition of that age-we
 should look to ourselves in this matter. Perhaps they were
 more open in their expression of belief in the supernatural,
 and perhaps that belief was wider spread than at present.
 The seventh Spectator gives a very good account of the minor
 superstitions, but does not touch on the grosser ones, such
 as the consulting of astrologers, and the belief in witches.
 These two things still exist in England, though nothing like
 to the extent they did in the early part of the last century.
 In spite of Hudibras and Sidrophel, an astrologer was a very
 important entity.  He published his almanacs-he drew
 horoscopes; and, as to witches, why, of course there were
 plenty of them. An old, ugly, soured, and malevolent
 woman earned a right to be considered such.
    As for the astrologers, it is needless to say they were un-
scrupulous, needy sharpers, who lived 'in all the By-Allies in
Moorfields, White Chappel, Salisbury Court, Water Lane,
Fleet Street, and Westminster.' Their advertisements have
come down to us, and a selection of two or three of them will
furnish both amusement and information.
  'In Cripplegate Parish, in Whitecross Street, almost at the
farther End near Old Street (turning in by the sign of the
Black Croe in Goat Alley, straight forward down three steps,

Woman be with Child, with Mail or Female, and whether
Delivered by Night or by Day? Sickness, the Duration, and
whether end in life or death ? Suits at Law, who shall over-

   'Likewise, he telleth the Meaning of all Magical Panticles,

   'He hath attained to the Signet Star of the Philosopher.
   'He likewise hath attained to the Green, Golden, and

them, &amp;c.
   'He hath a Secret in Art, far beyond the reach or Know-

   In this case we see the astrologer using the jargon of
the alchemists, to enhance his value in the eyes of his dupes.
It was still familiar to the ears of the people, and Jonson's
' Alchemist' was a popular play. The succeeding examples
are more commonplace:-

a Method never yet practised in England: He might give
Multitudes of Examples, but will give but one of a Sort.
   'A Young Woman, who had a Person pretended Love to

Deceitful to her, and that he never design'd to Marry her,
which was a great Trouble to her to hear, by reason she had

shortly after he Marryed another: Soon after she had several
Sweethearts at a Time, and came to me again for Advice; I
told her, there was but one of those she could be happy with,

him, and they prove a very Happy Couple.

Husband, I told her in a very few Months she'd Bury him and
Marry again very happily, which she found True,' &amp;c., &amp;c. 1
   The next is much shorter: ' Noble, or Ignoble, you may
be foretold any thing that may happen to your Elementary
Life: as at what time you may expect prosperity: or, if in
Adversity, the end thereof: Or when you may be so happy

   Ward,3 with his keen observation, naturally attacked these
gentry, lashed them unmercifully, and at great length. A
short extract must suffice for our purpose, and will sufficiently
show the estimation in which these astrologers were held by
persons of common sense.

Humane Shape, can be so stupidly Ignorant, as not to plainly
discern the Impositions that are put upon them by their
canting Albumazer; Who, in the first place, enquires about
what time, and in what manner the things were lost; and
what strangers they had in the House? From whence he

soever it be, was taken away by the Common Thief, or stolen
by a Servant, or Person that uses the House, or whether
Conceal'd by the Master or Mistress on purpose to make the
Servants more diligent. If his Conjecture be, that it was
taken by a Common Thief, he describes a Swarthy Black Ill
looking Fellow, with a down look, or the like; most wisely
considering, That such sort of Rogues are seldom without a
Gallows in their Countenances: Telling withall, That the
Goods are Pawn'd, and will scarcely be recoverable, without
they take the Thief speedily, in order to effect which, he

Ignoramus desires in Writing, for fear he should forget; which
the Sower look'd Conjurer gives him accordingly, after the
following manner:-Go a quarter of a Mile from your own
Dwelling, and then turn Easterly, and walk forward till you
come to the Sign of a large Four Footed Beast, and Search
within three or four Doors of that Sign, and you will go near
to take him, if you go soon enough, or hear of him, who is of a
middle Stature and in poor Habit. Away goes the Fool, as
well satisfied with the Note, as if he had the Rogue by the
Elbow, and if by any Accident they do hear of the Thief, all
is ascrib'd to the wonderful Cunning of their Wissard: But if
on the contrary, he believes it to be taken by a Servant, or

Story coming to the Ears of the Guilty, brings 'em under
such dreadful Apprehensions of the Conjuror's Indignation, if
they do not lay what they've taken within the time, according
to the Direction; that the first opportunity they have, they
will place it to the utmost exactness in whatever Hole or
Corner he has appointed for the finding of it.'
   The belief in witchcraft was still firmly rooted in the
country in spite of the more enlightened feeling on the subject
which prevailed in the metropolis. Addison 1 tells us of the
Coverley Witch, Moll White, how he and Sir Roger went and
visited her hovel, and found a broomstick behind the door,
and the tabby cat, which had as evil a reputation as its
mistress, and how 'In our return home, Sir Roger told me
that Old Moll had been often brought before him for making
Children spit Pins, and giving Maids the Night Mare; and
that the Country People would be tossing her into a Pond
and trying Experiments with her every Day, if it was not for
him and his Chaplain.'
   A little before this was written, two women had been
executed at Northampton for witchcraft, and at that very
time an old woman named Jane Wenham, living at a little
village in Hertfordshire called Walkerne, was charged with,
and next year tried for, witchcraft. She was condemned,
reprieved, and pardoned. But in 1716 Mrs. Hicks and her
daughter were executed at Huntingdon, and their crime was
that of selling their souls to the devil, etc. Indeed, the
capital sentence against witchcraft was only abolished by
an Act 9 Geo. II. cap. 5.
   There are two other published cases of witchcraft in
Queen Anne's time. One 2 is the 'Full and True Account of
the Apprehending and Taking of Mrs. Sarah Mordike, Who is
accused for a Witch. Being taken near Paul's Wharf on

for his Apprentice: This Old Jade came into his Shop to buy
a quartern of Sope, the young fellow happened to Laugh, and
the Scales not hanging right, cryed out he thought that they
were be Witch'd; The Old Woman hearing him say so, fell
into a great Passion, judging he said so to Ridicule her, ran
out of the Shop and threatned Revenge. In the Night was
heard a lumbring noise in the Shop, and the Man coming
down to see, found a strange Confusion, every thing turn'd
topsy turvy, all the goods out of order; but what was worse,
the next day the poor fellow was troubled with a strange
Disease, but (by) the good Prayers of some Neighbouring
Divines the power of the Devil was restrain'd.

us toss her into the River, for I have heard that if she Swims
'tis a certain sign of a Witch; in short they put their design
in Execution, for coming up to her, they tossed her in; but
like a Bladder when forc'd under Water pops up again, so
this Witch was no sooner in but Swam like a Corke; they
kept her in some time, and at last let her come out again;
she was no sooner out but she smote that Young Man
on the Arm, and told him he should pay dear for what
he had done. Immediately he found a strange pain on his
Arm, and looking on it found the exact mark of her Hand
and Fingers as black as a Cole; he went home where he lay
much Lamented and wonderfully affrighted with the Old
Woman coming to afflict him, and at last died with the pain,
and (was) Buried in St. Pulchers Church Yard.

was conducted towards the Justices' House she tried to leap
over the Wall, and had done it, had not the Constable
knocked her down. In this manner she was carried before
the Justice, there was Evidence that was with him in his Sick-

Habit of snuff-taking-Perfumes-Charles Lillie-List of scents-
  Soaps-Wash balls-' Complections'-Tooth powder-Hair dye-
  Spectacles.

THERE was one social habit that the two sexes had in
common, and that was in taking snuff: nay, it was more
than hinted that some of the fair sex smoked-not nice little
fairy 'Paquitas' or dainty little cigarettes, but nasty, heavy,
clumsy clay pipes. The subject will be discussed in another
part, but now we merely glance at the prevalence of the
habit-not so much with the ladies, as it was later on in the
century, but with the gentlemen; and the quantity taken, in
the latter part of the reign, was excessive.
   It is a marvel how the ladies at first allowed it, for it was
the custom in society for a gentleman to kiss all the ladies
in a room-a custom frequently mentioned in contemporary
literature, and therefore only requiring one quotation' to
illustrate it: 'The other Day entering a Room adorned with
the Fair Sex, I offered, after the usual Manner, to each of
them a Kiss; but one, more scornful than the rest, turned
her Cheek. I did not think it proper to take any Notice of
it till I had asked your Advice.'
   Besides, the ladies were undoubtedly fond of sweet smells,
perfumes, and scents; and one, in particular, seems to have
possessed remarkable properties. 'The Princely Perfume.
Being a most delightful Powder, which incomparably scents
Handkerchiefs, Gloves, and all Sorts of Linnen, making them
smell most deliciously oderiferous, fine and charming; it
perfumes the Hands, the Hair of the Head, and Periwigs

most delicately, also all Manner of Cloaths, Beds, Rooms,
Scrutores, Presses, Drawers, Boxes, and all other Things,
giving them a most admirable, pleasant and durable Scent,
which is so curiously fragrant, so delectably sweet, reviving
and enlivening, that no Perfume or Aromatick in the World,
can possibly come near it; it never raises the vapours in
Ladies, but, by its delicious Odour, Fragrancy and charming
Perfume (which is really Superior to all other Scents upon
Earth) it refreshes the Memory, cures the Head Ach, takes
away Dulness and Melancholy, makes the Heart glad, and
encreases all the Spirits, Natural, Vital, and Animal, to a
Wonder.' 1 And there was a much bepuffed scent called the
'Royal Essence,' which, besides being a paragon of perfume,
had the useful quality of curling the Periwig.
   But the prince of perfumers and puffers was Charles
Lillie, whose connection with the Tatler is so well known,
and who was so belauded, that Addison, or Steele, in No. 96,
had to issue a disclaimer. 'Whereas several have industri-
ously spread abroad, that I am in partnership with CHARLES
LILLIE the perfumer, at the corner of Beaufort Buildings ;-I
must say with my friend PARTRIDGE, that they are Knaves
who reported it. However, since the said CHARLES has
promised that all his customers shall be mine, I must desire
all mine to be his; and dare answer for him, that if you ask
in my name for Snuff, Hungary or orange water, you shall
have the best the town affords at the cheapest rate.'
   When Lillie died, he left his MS. receipts behind him,
made into a book, but it was never published till 1822; and
he gives a long list of the scents in use.

  Oil of cinnamon          Rose water
  Oil of marjoram          Cordova water
  Oil of coriander

  This reads like a very sufficient list of scents; that it
was not greater was undoubtedly owing to the disturbed
state of trade, and the absence of geographical discovery-
which of late years has greatly increased the perfumer's
repertoire.
   There were soaps enough, in all conscience-Joppa,
Smyrna, Jerusalem, Genoa, Venice, Castille, Marseilles,
Alicant, French, Gallipoly, Curd, Irish, Bristol, Windsor,
Black, and Liquid Soaps-and yet the ladies would use
abominations called 'Wash balls.' These must have been a
profitable manufacture, for the makers advertised freely in
the papers. Let us look into a 'Composition for best Wash
balls. Take forty pounds of rice in fine powder, twenty-eight
pounds of fine flour, twenty-eight pounds of Starch powder,
twelve pounds of white lead, and four pounds of Oris root in
fine powder; but no whitening. Mix the whole well together,
and pass it twice through a fine hair seive; then place it in a
dry place, and keep it for use. Great care must be taken
that the flour be not Musty, in which case the balls will in
time crack, and fall to pieces. To this composition may be
added Dutch pink, or brown fine damask powder, &amp;c., accord-
ing to the Colour required when the wash balls are quite dry.'
These wash balls were in some variety-common, best cam-
phor, ambergris, Bologna, marbled, figured, Greek, Mar-
seilles, Venice, and chemical.
   This making up of complexions was an art, and would
not bear trifling with. 'Madam, who dress'd you ? Here's
this Tooth set in the wrong way, and your Face so besmear'd !
What Complection do you use ? This is worse than they

daub Sign posts with; I never saw any thing so frightful.' 1
Naturally, with such an ingredient as white lead in their
composition, these wash balls were injurious to the skin-
vide a letter in Spectator, No. 41. ' Her skin is so tarnished
with this Practice, that when she first wakes in a Morning,
she scarce seems young enough to be the Mother of her whom
I carried to bed the Night before.' No wonder, for they used
carmine, French red, Portuguese dishes, Spanish wool and
papers, Chinese wool, and they had, also, pretty little lacquered
boxes of paints for the toilette sent over from China. There
was a wonderful 'bloom' advertised,' The famous Bavarian
Red Liquor, which gives such a blushing Colour to the
Cheeks of those that are white or pale, that it is not to be
distinguished from a natural fine Complection, nor perceived
to be Artificial by the nearest Friend, is nothing of Paint,
or in the least hurtful, but good in many Cases to be taken
inwardly; it renders the Face delightfully handsome and
beautiful, is not subject to be rub'd off like Paint, therefore
cannot be discovered by any one.' There were also pearl and
bismuth powders for the face.
   Rose and white lip salves were used as now, but their
dentifrices were peculiar, to say the least, if this is a fair
sample: 'Take four ounces of Coral, reduced to an unpalpable
powder, eight ounces of very light Armenian bole, one ounce
of Portugal Snuff, one ounce of Havanah Snuff, one ounce of
the ashes of good tobacco, which has been burnt, and one
ounce of gum myrrh, which has been well pulverised. Mix
all these well together, and sift them twice.' An inferior
tooth powder was made by leaving out the coral and substi-
tuting old broken pans (brown stone ware) reduced to a very
fine powder.  These mixtures were either rubbed on the
teeth with the finger, or else used with a vegetable tooth
brush or 'Dentissick Root,' which seems to have been made
out of the roots of the marsh mallow, partially dried, and then
fried in a mixture of rectified spirits, dragon's blood, and
conserve of roses, until they were hard; when one end was
bruised with a hammer, in order to open the fibres and form
a rudimentary brush. There were dentists, both male and
                 1 The Gentleman Cully, ed. 1702.

female, and they seem to have been so far successful that
some of them guarantee their patients being able to eat with
the false teeth after they were fixed. 'So firm and exact as
to be eat on, and not to be discover'd by any Person from
Natural Ones.'
    The usual way of darkening the hair was by the mecha-
nical means of a leaden comb. 1 'Jenny Trapes ! What that
Carrot pated Jade that Lodges at the Corner of White Horse
Alley !--The Same indeed, only She has black'd her Hair
with a Leaden Comb.' But there were also 'Hair Restorers'
in those days, as we find by an advertisement, that'All Per-
sons who, for themselves or Friend, having red or grey Hairs,
and would have them dy'd, or turn'd black or dark brown,
will find entire Satisfaction, as a great many have already, by
the use of a Clear Water,' etc.
   Should the sight fail, it could be aided by spectacles, as
now-but they were awsome things-with heavy horn, tor-
toiseshell, or silver rims, and were certainly no adjuncts to
personal appearance. They varied in price from 4d. to 25s.

AMONG the social institutions then in existence, was the
penny post, which cannot be better, or more tersely, de-
scribed than in Misson's own words: 'Every two Hours you
may write 1 to any Part of the City or Suburbs, he that re-
ceives it pays a Penny, and you give nothing when you put
it into the Post; but when you write into the Country, both
he that writes and he that receives pay each a Penny. It
costs no more for any Bundle weighing but a Pound, than for
a small Letter, provided the Bundle is not worth more than
ten Shillings. You may safely send Money, or any other
thing of Value, by this Conveyance, if you do but take care
to give the Office an Account of it. It was one Mr. William
Dockwra that set up this New Post, about the beginning of
the Reign of King Charles 2, and at first enjoy'd the Profits
himself; but the Duke of York who had then the Revenue
of the General Post, commenc'd a Suit against him, and
united the Penny Post to the other.'
   Misson makes a slight error here. The penny post was
started in 1683 by Rob. Murray, an upholsterer, but next
year, several charges being brought against him, he was
removed, and the concern was handed over to Dockwra,
who was dispossessed as above, by an action in which he was
cast both in damages and costs; but, about a year after, he

was appointed Controller of the District Post. He was
allowed a pension in the time of William and Mary (variously
stated of from 200 to 500 a year), but he only enjoyed it
four years, when he was discharged on account of some charges
of malversation, etc., which were brought against him.
    In January 1703, when Dockwra tried for the Chamber-
lainship of the City of London-which candidature, however,
he soon abandoned-he found it necessary to issue disclaimers,
and tell his version of the history of the penny post.1
    'Whereas a malicious false Report has been industriously
spread, that one Robert Murray was the first Inventor of the
Penny Post, and that he has been in Articles with me William
Dockwra, and wrong'd and hardly used; the World is desired
to take notice, That as to the first Pretence, it is utterly false,
for Dr. Chamberlen, one Henry Neville, Payne, and others
pretended themselves the first Inventors; And after I had
actually set up the Office, one Mr. Foxley came and shew'd
me a Scheme of his concerning a Penny Post, which he had
offer'd to Sir John Bennet, Post Master General, eight Years
before I ever Knew Murray, but that was rejected as im-
practicable, as indeed were all the rest of their Notions; nor
was it by any of them, or any other Person whatsoever, put
into any Method to make it practicable, till at my sole Charge
and Hazard I begun it in the Year 1680.
   'As to the Articles, they were sacredly Kept on my part,
but never perform'd by Murray, to my great Loss and
Damage, as by the very Articles themselves will evidently
appear; and I am ready at any time to demonstrate, it is so
far from having One Shilling due to him, or using him any
way hardly, That on the Contrary, in Compassion to his dis-
tressed Condition, I have often bayl'd him to keep him out
of Prison, and redeem'd him from thence, lent him several
Sums of Money, which he never took care to pay again; and
to this day I have Notes and Bonds to Produce, that he owes
me more than One hundred and Fifty Pounds: So that these
most unjust and ungrateful Allegations in Murray, are at this
time reviv'd to be made use of, as malicious Reflections to
lessen my Service to this City, and to stain my Reputation

and Integrity thereby, to hinder my Fellow Citizens Kindness
upon the Election for Chamberlain, which I hope will make
no Impression, since I do affirm myself to be the first that
ever put the Penny Post into Practice at a vast Expence and
great Loss to me and my Family.
                                 ' WILLIAM DOCKWRA.'

    And in the next day's Courant he was obliged to defend
himself from other allegations.
    'Whereas some Malicious Persons, designing to lessen me
in the good Opinion of my Fellow Citizens, have spread a
False and Scandalous Report, that I, William Dockwra, was
remov'd from being Comptroller of the Penny Post, because
of Injuries done to the Subject; and that I sunk the Revenue
at least one fourth part to the Crown. I do hereby declare,
That on the Contrary, I rectified many Abuses in the Manage-
ment of that Office, and never wrong'd either Crown or Sub-
ject of the Value of a Shilling: And I do positively affirm,
That I prov'd undeniably before the Post Master General
by the Accounts then made up, that I advanced that small
Revenue above Four Hundred Pounds: Yet neither my
Right to the whole (being the only Person that ever brought
the Penny Post to Perfection) nor the faithful Discharge of
my Trust while Comptroller thereof, were sufficient to protect
me against those Artifices too often made use of to remove
useful and honest Men from publick Imployment: Nor have
I receiv'd any of the Pension formerly granted me these two
Years and half past. So that I hope the Impartial World
will consider the great Loss I and my Family have sustain'd,
by being depriv'd of the Penny Post, whilst the Publick daily
reaps the Benefit and Advantage thereof and will do so to
Posterity.                      'WILLIAM DOCKWRA.'

    In 1711 an act was passed abolishing the penny post, and
on June 23 of that year a proclamation was issued putting it
in force. A notice had previously appeared in the London
Gazette of June 12/14, assimilating all rates to those of the
General Post, although for 'the Accommodation of the In-
habitants of such Places, their Letters will be convey'd with






TRADE, etc.

the same Regularity and Dispatch as formerly, being first
Tax'd with the Rates, and Stamp'd with the Mark of the
General Post Office, and that all Parcels will likewise be
Tax'd at the Rate of One Shilling per Ounce as the said Act
directs.'

    In 1709 the Foreign and Inland Post Letter days were:-
    ' MONDAY. To Spain, Italy, Germany, Flanders, Denmark,
                 Sweedland, Downs and Kent.
    'TUESDAY. Germany, Holland, Sweedland, Denmark,
                 North Britain, Ireland and Wales.
    ' WEDNESDAY. Kent and the Downs.
    'THURSDAY. Spain, Italy, and all parts of North Britain
                 and England.
    'FRIDAY. Italy, Germany, Flanders, Kent, Holland,
                 Sweedland, Denmark and Downs.
    'SATURDAY. All parts of Wales, North Britain, England,
                 and Ireland.

    'Letters return from all parts of England and North
 Britain, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; from Wales,
 Mondays and Fridays, from Kent and the Downs every day;
 but from beyond Sea uncertain.
    'The Carriage is 2d. a Sheet 80 Miles, double 4d. and 8d.
 an Ounce for more than Letters. All Letters more than 80
 Miles is 3d. Single and 6d. Double Pacquet 12d. an Ounce.
 A Letter to Dublin 6d. Single, Double 1/ and 1/6 an
 Ounce.'
    Foreign postage was not so very dear. In 1705, for in-
stance, a letter of a single sheet could be carried to the West
Indies for 1s./3d. and 2 sheets for 2/6; whilst from thence
to England it was respectively 1/6 and 3/, or by weight
6/ per oz.
    In 1708 Mr. Povey established a foot post-carrying
letters, in the London district only, for one halfpenny. How
long he kept it up does not seem clear; the Post Office
authorities stopped him; but there is an advertisement re-
ferring to it in the Daily Courant of July 4, 1710: 'Whereas
a Person in some Distress sent a letter by the Halfpenny







134    SOCIAL LIFE in the reign of QUEEN ANNE.

Carriage on Monday night last,' etc., and this clearly shows
it was in existence at that date.
    The Gazette Nov. 29/Dec. I, 1709, has the following
Advertisement: 'Whereas Charles Povey and divers Traders
and Shop Keepers in and about the Cities of London and
Westminster, Borough of Southwark and Parts adjacent, and
several Persons ringing Bells about the Streets of the said
Cities and Borough, have set up, imploy'd, and for sometime
continued a Foot Post for Collecting and Delivering Letters
within the said Cities and Borough, and Parts adjoining, for
Hire under the Name of the Halfpenny Carriage. Contrary
to the Known Laws of this Kingdom, and to the great Pre-
judice of her Majesty's Revenues arising by Posts; her
Majesty's Postmaster General has therefore directed Informa-
tions in her Majesty's Court of Exchequer, to be exhibited
against the said Charles Povey, and several Shop Keepers
and Ringers of Bells, for Recovery against every of them of
100 for such setting up, and for every week's continuance
thereof; and also 5 for every Offence in Collecting and
Delivering of Letters for Hire as aforesaid, contrary to the
Statute for erecting and establishing a Post Office.'
   These additions to the rate of postage, of course, induced
people to look after franks-the granting of which, however,
had not assumed anything like the proportions it did later on.
   But there was not the hurrying and driving in business
then as now. Men lived over their shops or counting houses,
and, being easily accessible, did their work in a deliberate,
leisurely manner, and began their business very early in the
day. For instance, when Sir William Withers, Lord Mayor in
1707, was putting up for a seat in Parliament, he adduced,
as showing he would have time for his parliamentary duties,
that 'There is not above one Cause in a Day through-
out the whole Year, to be Heard after Ten a Clock in the
Morning.' 1 'Change was earlier than now; 'Crowds of
People gather at the Change by One, disperse by Three.'2
It is thus humorously described: 3 'The Exchange is the
Land's Epitome, or you might call it the little Isle of Great

Britain did the Waters encompass it. It is more, 'tis the
whole World's Map which you may here discern in its per-
fectest Motion, justling and turning. 'Tis a vast heap of
Stones, and the confusion of Languages makes it resemble
Babel. The Noise in it is like that of Bees; a strange
Humming or Buzzing, of walking tongues and feet; it is a
kind of a still Roaring, or loud Whisper. It is the great
Exchange of all Discourses, and no Business whatsoever but
is here on Foot. All things are sold here, and Honesty by
Inch of Candle; but woe be to the Purchaser, for it will never
thrive with him.'
   In the centre of the Exchange was a statue of Charles
II., and here the stock jobbers hovered about-when they
were not at Robin's or Jonathan's in Exchange Alley; and
all about, each under his own nationality, stood the trim
Italian, the Hollanders and Germans, with their slovenly
mien, and uncouth, unkempt beards and moustachios. The
Dons, in flat crowned hats and short cloaks, took snuff
prodigiously, and smelt terribly of garlic; there were the
lively Gauls, animated and chattering, 'ready to wound
every Pillar with their Canes, as they pass'd by, either in
Ters, Cart, or Saccoon.' Jews of course, amber necklace
sellers from the Baltic in fur caps and long gowns, a
sprinkling of seedy military men, and the merchants. These
were the constituent parts of 'Change in those days, and it
must have been a sight worth seeing. Round about were
shops as now, where the spruce young Cits ogled the pretty
glove sellers, or bought a Steinkirk, or a sword knot. Con-
temporary accounts of these fair damsels are not very good,
but it was rather a libellous or scurrilous age as regards
women, and they might not be true, or at all events be taken
with much salt.
   Ward 1 gives an amusing account of the exterior. 'The
Pillars at the Entrance of the Front Porticum were adorn'd
with sundry Memorandums of old Age and Infirmity, under
which stood here and there a Jack in a Box, like a Parson in
a Pulpit, selling Cures for your Corns, Glass Eyes for the
Blind, Ivory Teeth for Broken Mouths, and Spectacles for the

Hawkers, Gardeners, Mandrake Sellers, and Porters; after we
had Crowded a little way amongst the Miscellaneous Multi-
tude, we came to a Pippin Monger's Stall, surmounted with a
Chymist's Shop; where Drops, Elixirs, Cordials, and Balsams
had justly the Pre-eminence of Apples, Chesnuts, Pears, and
Oranges,' etc., showing a view of the motley group of coster-
mongers without. The pillars of the Exchange were hung
round with advertisements, as indeed they were until very
recently.
   Some well-known names of bankers were then in exist-
ence-Child's, Hoare's, Stone's, and Martin's. In Harl. MSS.
5,996, 153 is a somewhat curious advertisement of Sir Richard
Hoare's. 'WHEREAS there hath been several false and
Malicious Reports industriously spread abroad reflecting on
Sir Richard Hoare, Goldsmith, for occasioning and promoting
a Run for Money on the Bank of England; and in particular,
several of the Directors of the said Bank reporting, That the
said Sir Richard sent to the Bank for Ten of their Notes of
&pound;10 each, with a design to send several Persons with the said
Notes to receive the Money thereon, so as to effect his ill
Designs, and to bring a Disreputation on the Bank, and
occasion a Disturbance in the City of London:
   'This is to satisfie all Persons, That the Right Honourable
the Lord Ashburnham, Father of the Honourable Major
Ashburnham, Major of the First Troop of Her Majesty's Life
Guards, who was ordered to march for Scotland, sending to
the said Sir Richard Hoare for a large Quantity of Gold, and
for Ten Bank Notes of 10 each, for the said Major to take
with him to bear his Expenses. The Gold was sent to his
Lordship accordingly, and Sir Richard's Servant went to the
Bank for ten Notes of 10 each, which the Cashier of the
Bank refus'd to give: But if Sir Richard had intended to
promote a Run for Mony on the Bank, he could have done it
in a more effectual manner, having by him, all the time that
the great demand for Mony was on the Bank, several Thousand
Pounds in Notes payable by the Bank; and also there was
brought to Sir Richard by several Gentlemen, in the time of
the Run on the Bank, Notes payable by the said Bank,







TRADE, etc.



137



amounting to a great many Thousands of Pounds, which he
was desir'd to take and receive the Mony presently from the
Bank, which he refus'd to do until the great Demand on the
Bank for Money was over.
   'N.B. That the Reports against Sir Richard have been
more Malicious than herein is mention'd, which he forbears
to insert for brevity's sake.'
   Ward, for some reason, disliked bankers: he says,' What
methods do they take now to improve their Cash? The
chief advantage they now make is by supplying the Necessi-
ties of straiten'd Merchants and great Dealers, to pay (for)
the Goods imported, rather than they should fall under the
Discredit as well as Disadvantage of being run into the
King's Ware House, or by assisting of 'em in the purchase
of great Bargains, or the like; for which they make 'em pay
such unreasonable extortion, that they devour more of the
Merchants Profit than Snails, Worms or Magpies, do of the
Farmers Crop, or the Gardiner's Industry.' If this was all
the fault he could find, their iniquities were not very glaring.

WE have seen the birth, marriage, and funeral of these good
people, and have noted some of their social habits. Next is,
how did they dress ? Far plainer than in Charles the Second's
time, rather richer than under solemn and austere Dutch
William, yet not nearly as finely as during the Georgian era.
That, of course, is speaking of ordinary mortals-neither the
titled ones of the land, who showed their rank by their
dress, nor the beaus, who formed no inconsiderable portion
of metropolitan life, and at whom were levelled stinging little
shafts of satire from all sides, mostly good-humoured. The
macaroni, the dandy, the buck, the blood, the swell-all are
fine, but the beau of Anne's time was superfine, and modelled
on the messieurs of the time of Louis XIV. He cannot be
dismissed in a few words, for he was an institution of the
time. There were travelled fops, and they were hated-
there were those of home manufacture, and they were laughed
at. Misson notes that 'A Beau is so much the more re-
markable in England, because generally speaking, the English
Men dress in a plain uniform manner,' and he describes them
as 'Creatures compounded of a Perriwig and a Coat laden
with Powder as white as a Miller's, a Face besmear'd with
Snuff, and a few affected airs; they are exactly like Moliere's
Marquesses, and want nothing but that Title, which they
would infallibly assume in any other Country but England.'

Cibber 1 describes him as one 'that's just come to a small
Estate, and a great Perriwig-he that Sings himself among
the Women-He won't speak to a Gentleman when a Lord's
in Company. You always see him with a Cane dangling at
his Button, his Breast open, no Gloves, one Eye tuck'd under
his Hat, and a Toothpick.' Verily, there is little new under
the sun, and we, in these our latter days, have been familiar
with the Toothpick.
   Ward naturally loves him-impales him on his entomo-
logical pin-and enjoys his wriggles. He puts him under
his microscope and minutely observes him, and then gives us
the benefit of his description: 'A Beau is a Narcissus that is
fallen in Love with himself and his own Shadow. Within
Doors he is a great Friend to a great Glass, before which
he admires the Works of his Taylor more than the whole
Creation. His Body's but a Poor Stuffing of a Rich Case,
like Bran to a Lady's Pincushion; that when the outside
is stript off, there remains nothing that's Valuable. His
Head is a Fool's Egg, which lies hid in a Nest of Hair;
His Brains are the Yolk, which Conceit has Addled. He's a
stroling Assistant to Drapers and Taylors, showing every
other Day a New Pattern, and a New Fashion. He's a
Walking Argument against Immortality; For no Man by
his Actions, or his Talk can find he has more Soul than a
Goose. He's a very Troublesome Guest in a Tavern; and
must have good Wine chang'd three or four Times till they
bring him the worst in the Cellar, before he'll like it. His
Conversation is as intolerable as a young Councel's in Term
Time, Talking as much of his Mistresses, as the other does of
his Motions; and will have the most Words, tho' all he says
is nothing. He's a Bubble to all he deals with, even to his
Periwig Maker; and hates the sordid Rascal that won't
Flatter him. He scorns to condescend so low, as to speak of
any Person beneath the dignity of a Noble man; the Duke
of such a Place, and my Lord such one, are his common
Cronies, from whom he knows all the Secrets of the Court,
but dares not impart 'em to his best Friends, because the
Duke enjoyn'd him to Secrecie. He is always furnish'd with

new Jests from the last New Play, which he most commonly
spoiles with repeating. His Watch he compares with every
Sun Dial, Swears it corrects the Sun; and plucks it out
so frequently in Company, that his Fingers go oftener in a
Day to his Fob, than they do to his Mouth, spending more
time every Week in showing the Rarity of the Work, than
the Man did in making on't; being as forward to tell the
Price without desiring, as he is to tell you the Hour without
asking; he is a constant Visitor of a Coffee house, where he
Cons over the News Papers with much indifference; Reading
only for Fashion's sake and not for Information. He's com-
monly of a small standing at one of the Universities, tho' all
he has learnt there, is to Know how many Taverns there are
in the Town, and what Vintner has the handsom'st Wife....
He's a Coward amongst Brave men, and a Brave fellow among
Cowards; a Fool amongst Wise men, and a Wit in Fool's
company.'
   Pretty hard hitting; but it is borne out on all hands.
Try another description : ' His first Care is his Dress, the
next his Body; and in the uniting these Two lies his Soul
and Faculties. His business is in the Side Box, the Stage,
and the Drawing Room; his Discourse consists of Dress,
Equipage, and the Ladies, and his extream Politeness in
writing Billet deux; which he never fails to shew in all Com-
panies. The nice Management of his Italian Snuff box, and
the affected Screw of his Body, makes up a great Part of his
Conversation, and the Pains he takes to recommend himself,
wou'd set Heraclitus a Laughing. He's perpetually Laughing
to shew his white Teeth, and is never serious but with his
Taylor. His whole Design is bent upon a Fortune, which if
he gets, the Coach and Equipage is still supported; if not
his fine Cloaths and he prove stale together, and he is com-
monly buried ere he dies in a Gaol, or the Country, two
places equally disagreeable to a Man of his Complexion.'
   And, not to be wearisome, we will conclude with John
Hughes' 'Inventory of a Beau' :2 'A very rich tweezer case,
containing twelve instruments for the use of each hour in the

which are to continue in fashion for three months after the
sale.'
   In a description of men's dress, we will begin at his hat,
and descend gradually to his boots. The hats were rather
low crowned, made of felt, with very broad flapping brims-
which were looped up, or cocked-very much at the fancy of
the wearer--and the absence of this cocking denoted a sloven.

'Take out your Snuff Box, Cock, and look smart, hah !'
says Clodio to his bookworm brother Carlos; and their
numerous shapes are alluded to by Budgell,2 'I observed
afterwards, that the Variety of Cocks into which he moulded
his Hat, had not a little contributed to his Impositions upon
me.'
    They were universally of black hue; at least I have never
met with mention of any other colour, except in sport: 'I
shall very speedily appear at White's in a Cherry coloured
Hat. I took this Hint from the Ladies Hoods, which I look
upon as the boldest Stroke that Sex has struck for these
three hundred Years last past.'3  They had a gold or silver
lace hat band, but ordinary people seldom had their hats
edged. A hatband was considered de rigueur for servants,
and Swift's man, Peter, even bought a silver one for himself,
rather than be without one. Feathers were only worn by
military men. 'The Person wearing the Feather, though our
Friend took him for an Officer in the Guards, has proved to
be an arrant Linnen Draper,'4 i.e. only in the train bands.
   But it was in the periwig, the Falbala, or Furbelow, the
dress wig of the age, that all care was centred, and in
which all the art of dress culminated. Originally invented
by a French courtier to conceal a deformity in the shoulders,
either of the Dauphin, or the Duke of Burgundy, its use spread
all over Europe; but, perhaps, the fashion never was so pre-
posterous at any time, as it was in Anne's reign, if we except
the wonderful wig of the spendthrift Sir Edward Hunger-
ford (whose bust used to be in a niche in Hungerford Market)
in the middle of the previous century, who is said to have
given five hundred guineas for a wig! They were made from
women's hair-or, at least, were so presumably. Of this we
have many examples; take one: 'A noisie Temple Beaux
with a Peruke of his Sister's Hair ill made';5
         They made our Sparks cut off their Nat'ral Hair,
         A d-d long W-'s Hair Periwig to wear.6

Women's hair was a valuable commodity, judging by the
following: 'An Oxfordshire Lass was lately courted by a
young man of that County, who was not willing to marry her
unless her friends could advance 50 for her portion; which
they being incapable of doing, the lass came to this City to try
her fortune, when she met with a good Chapman in the Strand,
who made a purchase of her Hair (which was delicately long
and light), and gave her sixty pounds for it, being 20 ounces at
3 an ounce; with which money she joyfully returned into the
Country and bought her a husband.'1 Indeed, it was an
article of general purchase and sale: 'We came up to the
corner of a narrow Lane, where Money for old Books was
writ upon some part or other of every Shop, as surely as
Money for Live Hair, upon a Barber's Window.' 2
   Men used to travel the country on horseback and collect
it, and it was not unfrequent for suspected highwaymen, when
stopped and brought before the authorities, to declare they
were dealers in hair, roaming about, following their avoca-
tion-although it could not have been a very remunerative
one, if we can believe the advertisements for the apprehension
of deserters from the army: 'said he was a dealer in hair'
being frequently mentioned. Here is an advertisement which
gives a graphic picture of one of these gentry: ' Lost on
Tuesday Night last the 14th Instant, about 6 in the Evening,
from behind a Gentleman in Piccadilly, a Pair of Bags, in which
were three Bladders with Hair in, two Holland Shirts, Neck-
cloaths, and other Linnen, A Leather Bag with an Iron
Instrument and Hair in it, a pair of small Perriwig Cards,
with Read the Maker's Name in Flower de Luce Court in
Fleet Street, and other small matters beside,'3 etc.; and we
may note that 'At the Sugar Loaf in Bishopsgate Street
near Cornhil, is the House of Call, where Perriwig Makers
can have Men, and Men may have Masters.'4
   'Did you ever see a Creature more ridiculous than that
stake of human nature which dined the other day at our
house, with his great long wig to cover his head and face;

which was no bigger than a Hackney Turnep, and much of
the same form and shape ? Bless me, how it looked! just
like a great platter of French Soup, with a little bit of flesh
in the middle. Did you mark the beau tiff of his wig, what
a deal of pains he took to toss it back, when the very weight
thereof was like to draw him from his seat ?'1 And they must
have been heavy. 'His Wigg I believe had a pound of Hair
and two pounds of powder in't.'2 And again,' One Impudent
Correcter of Jade's Flesh, had run his Poles against the back
Leather of a foregoing Coach, to the great dammage of a
Beau's Reins, who peeping out of the Coach door, with at
least a fifty Ounce Wig on,' etc.3
   The furbelow, or dress wig, was sometimes called a
'long Duvillier' (see Tatler 29), from a famous French per-
ruquier of that name ; and these wigs were not only long, but
tall: vide the humorous advertisement in the Tatler (180):
'N.B. Dancing Shoes, not exceeding four inches in height in
the heels, and periwigs not exceeding three feet in length,
are carried in the coach box gratis.' Not to have it in per-
fect curl was unendurable. 'I think standing in the Pillory
cannot be a more sensible Ignominy to a Gentleman that
wears tolerable Cloaths, than appearing in Publick with a
rumpled Periwig.'4 Pretty dears! they used to carry ivory or
tortoiseshell combs, curiously ornamented, with them, and
comb their precious wigs in public-ay, the most public
places-walking in the Park, or sitting in the Beau's Para-
dise, the side box of the theatre, and when paying visits.
But it seems to have been in anybody's power, by the
exercise of a little trouble, to keep his wig in proper curl.
'The Secret White Water to Curl Gentlemen's Hair, Chil-

Street. Price 1s. a Bottle.'
    These wigs were expensive-that is, if Steele and Addison
do not exaggerate. Take this example from  the Tatler,
No. 54.  ' He answered Phillis a little abruptly at supper the
same evening, upon which she threw his perriwig into the
fire. "Well," said he, " thou art a brave termagant jade; do
you know, hussy, that fair wig cost forty guineas ?" ' And
in the Guardian (No. 97),' This gave me some encourage-
ment; so that to mend the matter, I bought a fine flaxen
long wig that cost me thirty guineas.' But there were wigs
and wigs, and probably these highly priced ones were some-
what abnormal; at all events, ordinary people could not
have afforded them, for we find Swift loud in his laments
about paying three guineas for one.l 'It has cost me three
guineas to day for a periwig. I am undone! It was made by
a Leicester lad, who married Mrs. Worrall's daughter, where
my mother lodged; so I thought it would be cheap, and
especially since he lives in the city.'
    It must not be imagined that the periwig was the only
 variety. On the contrary, there were several kinds of wig.
 'I had an humble Servant last Summer, who the first time
 he declared himself, was in a Full Bottom'd Wigg; but the
 Day after, to my no small Surprize, he accosted me in a thin
 Natural one. I received him, at this our second Interview,
 as a perfect Stranger, but was extreamly confounded, when
 his speech discovered who he was. I resolved, therefore, to
 fix his Face in my Memory for the future; but as I was
 walking in the Park the same Evening, he appeared to me in
 one of those Wiggs that I think you call a Night Cap, which
 had altered him more effectually than before. He afterwards

played a Couple of Black Riding Wiggs upon me, with the
same Success,'l etc. The 'Night Cap' wig was a sort of
periwig, with a short tie and a small round head. Then there
was a 'Campaign' wig, which was imported from France;
and this was made very full, was curled, and eighteen inches
in length in the front, with drop locks. In the contemporary
prints of Marlborough's victories, the back part of the wig
is sometimes shown as being put in a black silk bag. We
get an approximate idea of their value from the following
advertisement: 'Lost &amp;c. a Campaign Perriwig, fair Hair
with a large Curl, value about 7 guineas,' etc.
   I have come across one mention of a 'Spanish Wigg,'
but as this was worn by a runaway ship's apprentice, it was
probably of foreign manufacture, and the species had no
place here. Lastly, there was the 'Bob' wig, or attempt to
imitate the natural head of hair. This wig was mostly in use
among the lower orders; and many are the descriptions of
it, and its various colours, in the advertisements for army
deserters. But the better class also used it. We have seen,
in the Spectator, No. 319, how a man wore 'a thin Natural'
wig; so also we read in Steele's 'Lying Lover,' 'What shall I
do for powder for this smart Bob ?'
   The proper quality, and quantity, of his powder, must have
been a serious weight upon the mind of a beau. Its ground-
work, or basis, was starch, very finely ground and sifted; but
this was adulterated with burnt alabaster, plaster of Paris
(which was called in the trade Old Doctor), whitening, fine
flour, flour from pearl barley, and other things; and it was
scented-well, we should think to a sickening degree-with
ambergris, musk and civet, violets, orris root, rose, bergamot,
orange flowers, and jessamine.  And there were different
coloured hair powders. The black was made with starch,
Japan ink, and ivory black; a cheaper sort was made of
pounded coal-dust. Brown was made with starch and umber
-according to the shade required. Grey was produced by
mixing some of the black powder with more starch, and
adding a little smalts.

   Gay presents us with a curious little piece of economy :-
         When suffocating Mists obscure the Morn
         Let thy worst Wig, long us'd to Storms, be worn;
         This knows the powder'd Footman, and with Care,
         Beneath his flapping Hat, secures his Hair.'
   We are indebted also to Gay 2 for the following vivid
description of the manner in which the beaus were robbed
of their cherished chevelure:--
         Nor is thy Flaxen Wigg with Safety worn;
         High on the Shoulder, in the Basket born,
         Lurks the sly Boy; whose Hand to Rapine bred,
         Plucks off the curling Honours of the Head.
   This was an ingenious plan, but it was almost equalled in
the very early years of George I. by a practice which sprung
up, of cutting a hole in the leather backs of the carriages,
boldly clutching the occupant's wig, and dragging it through
the hole.
   Some few had the courage to wear their own hair, and
here is a hairdresser's advertisement on the subject: 3 'Next
door to the Golden Bell in St. Bride's Lane Fleet Street,
Liveth Lydia Beecroft, who Cutteth and Curleth    Ladies,
Gentlemen's, and   Childrens  Hair; and    selleth  a fine
Pomatum, which is mixt with Ingredients of her own making,
that if the Hair be never so Thin, it makes it grow Thick;
if Short, it makes it grow Long: If any Gentlemens or
Childrens Hair be never so Lank, she makes it Curle in a
little time like a Periwig. She waits on Ladies, if desir'd, on
Tuesdays and Fridays; the other Days of the Week, she is
to be spoken with at Home.' So that we see the 'Professors'
of those days were very similar to their congeners of ours,
and had invaluable nostrums-'prepared only by,' etc.
Bear's grease used to be imported from Russia; but a
spurious kind was also sold, made out of dog's, or goat's, fat,
or rancid hog's lard. There were common, hard, black, and
brown pomatums, to say nothing of powders and liquids for
thickening the hair, principally made of burdock root and
small beer, and a powder for cleansing the hair, made with
cassia wood and white vitriol.

   We next come to the neckcloth, as no collar or band of
the shirt was shown; and the one most in fashion was the
'Steinkirk,' so called from the battle of that name, which was
fought on Aug 3, 1692, when the English under William III.
were defeated, and the campaign broken up. This style of
neckcloth was introduced from  Paris, and it was highly
fashionable there, because its negligent style was popularly
supposed to imitate the disordered dress of the victorious
French generals, who were so eager to rush into the fight that
they did not stop to finish dressing-or, at all events, to tie
their neckcloths. It was a very graceful fashion, and the ends,
which were laced or fringed, were sometimes tucked in the
waistcoat or shirt. They are frequently alluded to as 'snuff
grimed.'  Ladies also wore them, as in 'The Careless
Husband' Lady Easy 'takes her Steinkirk from her Neck
and lays it gently over his Head.'
   And there was the 'Berdash.' 'I have prepared a treatise
against the Cravat and berdash, which I am told is not ill
done.' 1 Some have imagined that the word haberdasher is
derived from this neckcloth, but it is too ridiculous to think
of for a moment, as there were haberdashers as early as
Edward the Third's reign, and at the time of which we write
there were 'haberdashers of hats.'  In the epilogue to
Mrs. Centlivre's 'Platonick Lady,' 'design'd to be spoken by
Mrs. Bracegirdle but came too late,' it is mentioned-
     Yet, tell me, Sirs, don't you as nice appear
     With your false Calves, Bardash, and Fav'rites here ? 2

The Daily Courant, Nov. 4, 1708, says: 'Also very fine
Muslin Neckcloths to be sold at 5s. a Piece.'
   A gentleman's shirt was of fine holland, and was some-
what dear-the fronts were worn very open, and the ruffles were
not laced, at least for ordinary wear: this piece of extrava-
gance was reserved for a later time. Showing so much of the
shirt necessitated clean linen, but it is hardly likely that
many followed the example of Tom Modely, 3 whose 'busi-
ness in this world is to be well dressed; and the greatest

circumstance that is to be recorded in his annals is that he
wears twenty shirts a week.' That they were costly, we may
judge from the fact that Swift was not extravagant in his
dress, and that he bought them first-hand in Holland, by
means of his friend Harrison, who was under great obliga-
tions to him.  '28 Feb. 1718. I have sent to Holland for a
dozen shirts,' etc.-and again he writes: 'Jan. 31, 1713. I
paid him (Harrison) while he was with me seven guineas, in
part of a dozen of shirts he bought me in Holland.'
   This having the waistcoat unbuttoned to show the shirt
is very frequently mentioned, but it was eminently a young
man's practice. A lady, speaking of her husband, says:
' You must know, he tells me that he finds London is a much
more healthy place than the Country; for he sees several of
his old acquaintance and schoolfellows are here young fellows
with fair full-bottomed perriwigs. I could scarce keep him
this morning from going out open breasted.'2  Again 3: 'There
is a fat fellow whom I have long remarked, wearing his
breast open in the midst of winter, out of an affectation of
youth. I have therefore sent him just now the following
letter in my physical capacity:-

   '"Sir,
         "'From the twentieth instant to the first of May
next, both days inclusive, I beg of you to button your waist-
coat from your collar to your waistband."'
It was supposed to have a most killing effect on the fair
sex. 'A sincere heart has not made half so many con-
quests as an open waistcoat.'4 The waistcoats, otherwise,
were seldom mentioned; they were long, but not so long as
they afterwards became; and, with the exception of very fine
suits, seem to have been quite plain. One or two advertise-
ments of fine clothes will tell us a great deal about them

for 'the prince of puppies, Colonel Edgworth,'1 who went one
day to see his brother who lived but a day's journey from
him; yet he took with him a led horse loaded with port-
manteaus. On his arrival, these were unpacked, and three
suits of clothes, each finer than the other, were displayed on
chairs, his nightgown on another, and his shaving plate all
put out. Next morning he appeared at breakfast with his
boots on, and his brother asked him where he was going for
a ride before dinner. He replied that he was going home;
that he had only just come to see him, and must go back at
once, which he did. The poor man afterwards died mad in
the common Bridewell at Dublin.
   Noblemen wore their stars on their coats, and their
ribands, but it must have been a Collar day when the fol-
lowing happened: 'On Wednesday morning last between
11 and 12 at St. James's Gate, was dropt from a Nobleman's
Coller of Esses, an enamel'd George; if brought to Mr. Mead's,
a Goldsmith, at the Black Lyon within Temple Bar, shall
have a Guinea Reward, and no Questions ask'd.'2 The
reward does not indicate reckless prodigality on the part
of the nobleman.

   We have seen that there was a great variety of colours
in men's clothing. A little curiosity in colour must not pass
unnoticed.
         The City Prentices, those upstart Beaus
         In short spruce Puffs and Vigo coloured clothes 1

-a colour which might puzzle for some time, were it not
for the huge quantity of snuff captured at Vigo in 1702.
   There were clothes of Drap du Barri and D'Oyley suits,
so called after the famous haberdasher, whose name still
survives in the dessert napkin. They were made of drugget
and sagathay, camlet, but the majority of men wore cloth. It
is scarcely necessary to describe the shape of the coat, for
the illustrations show it better than any printed description.
There is but one peculiarity I would point out-that in 1711
the coats used to be wired to make them stick out. 'The
Skirt of your fashionable Coats forms as large a Circumference
as our Petticoats; as these are set out with Whalebone, so
are those with Wire, to encrease 'and sustain the Bunch of
Fold that hangs down on each side.' 2
   The cheap clothiers lived in Monmouth Street, St. Giles,
(now called Dudley Street), and there was no love lost be-
tween them and their higher-priced brethren, as the following
advertisement shows: 'Whereas the Monmouth Street Men
and other Taylors in and about the City, have by divers Ad-
vertisements in the Postman and other publick Prints, and by
Bills given from Door to Door, boasted what mighty Penny-
worths Persons may have of them, in selling Sagathy and
Druggit Suits, the smallest sized Men for 3 Guineas, and the
largest sizes for 3 10s. and Men's Cloth Suits at 4 and
&pound;4 10s. This is to acquaint all Persons that have occasion
for such Suits, if they please to make Tryal, may have the
same as Cheap in Birchin lane, and as well and as fashionable
made, and may be assured of seeing more choice both of
broad Cloaths, Camblet, Druggits and Sagathys than many
of those Upstarts can pretend to.' 3

type of all. 'At the sign of the Golden Heart in Monmouth
Street in St. Giles' in the Fields. All Gentlemen and Others,

and the largest size at Three Pound Ten Shillings; with all

and Laced Liveries proportionable; As likewise all sorts
of Camblet Suits very Reasonable, and Campaign Coats at
Fifteen or Sixteen Shillings a Coat; All sorts and sizes of
Boys Cloathes, very Good and Cheap.'  In reading these
advertisements, and indeed in all quotations of price, the
different value of money-then and now-should never be
forgotten; three pounds being equivalent to seven or eight. So
that, according to our ideas, clothing was dearer then than now.
   In the country, owing to the very little correspondence
between it and the metropolis, of course the fashions were
some time in reaching remote distances, and were equally
long in departing from thence, to make way for new ones.
Addison humorously describes the fashions for men in Corn-
wall in 1711 . ' From this place, during our progress through
the most western parts of the kingdom, we fancied ourselves
in King Charles the Second's reign, the people having made
vary little variations in their dress since that time. The
smartest of the country Squires appear still in the Monmouth
Cock, and when they go a wooing, whether they have any
post in the militia or not, they generally put on a red coat.
We were indeed very much surprised, at the place we lay at
last night, to meet with a gentleman that had accoutred him-
self in a night cap wig, a coat with long pockets and slit
sleeves, and a pair of shoes with high scallop tops; but we
soon found by his conversation that he was a person who
laughed at the ignorance and rusticity of the country people,
and was resolved to live and die in the mode.'2

   Of men's breeches, and the materials of which they were
made, very little mention is made; but the stocking is fre-
quently brought to notice. They were of cloth, knitted
woollen, thread, and silk. The latter were of all colours, to
suit the beaus' costumes, but black silk was the wear of your
well-to-do citizen, professional man, or gentleman. Misson
says 'The English Silk Stockings are one of its famous Mer-
chandizes;' and solemn old Thoresby records how he and
his cousin 'bought each a pair
of black silk rolling stockings in
Westminster Hall.' There is no
mention of gaiters as a protec-
tion against cold, rain, or mud.
Addison grumbles that 'another in-
forms me of a Pair of silver Gar-
ters buckled below the knee, that
have lately been seen at the Rain-
bow Coffee house in Fleet Street,'
and considers it his mission
'to Correct those Depraved Sen-
timents that give Birth to all
those little Extravagances which
appear in their outward Dress
and Behaviour.'
   With regard to shoes, there
seems to have been much fop-
pery. Red heels are specially
railed against by the Spectator. The beaus wore the heels
very high, as indeed was the fashion with the fair sex. Gay
speaks, among his de omnibus rebus, of shoes, and gives
the following advice2:-

         When the Black Youth at chosen Stands rejoice,
         And Clean your Shoes resounds from ev'ry Voice;
         When late their miry Sides Stage Coaches show,
         And their stiff Horses thro' the Town move slow;
         When all the Mall in leafy Ruin lies,
         And Damsels first renew their Oyster Cries:

         Then let the prudent Walker Shoes provide
         Not of the Spanish or Morocco Hide;
         The wooden Heel may raise the Dancer's Bound,
         And with the 'scallop'd Top his Step be crown'd:
         Let firm, well hammer'd Soles protect thy Feet
         Thro' freezing Snows, and Rains, and Soaking Sleet.
         Should the big Laste extend the Shoe too wide,
         Each Stone will wrench th' unwary Step aside:
         The sudden Turn may stretch the swelling Vein,
         Thy cracking Joint unhinge, or Ankle sprain;
         And when too short the modish Shoes are worn,
         You'll judge the Seasons by your shooting Corn.

Shoe-strings had gone out, and buckles were in fashion; but
they had not assumed the proportions they did in after years.
Boots were never worn except for riding; and there was in
                this reign very little improvement on the heavy
                and clumsy riding-boot of William the Third's
                time, which was still worn by Marlborough
                and his cavalry. Many are the pairs, with
                their spurs, that are advertised for, as being
                left in coaches.
                   In those days of bad pavements and
               defective sewage, when men had hardly begun
               the general use of the chair, and a coach was,
               as now, the luxury of the few, shoeblacks were
               a necessity; and, although a man might, like
the Templar in 'Sir Roger de Coverley,' 'have his shoes rubbed
and his periwig powdered at the Barber's, as you go unto the
Rose,' yet a large number of 'Black Youth at chosen Stands
rejoice; and Clean your Shoes resounds from ev'ry Voice.'
They were very numerous; and from them is derived our
word blackguard, for so were they called about Charing
Cross and White Hall.
   There were different kinds of blacking, but, judging from
the dispraise awarded to each other's goods by rival manu-
facturers, they could have been neither pleasant nor effective.

plause, causing the straitest Shooes to wear with delight and

from cracking or rotting to the very last; and frees the Feet
from all Pains, Corns, Swellings, &amp;c. . . . Price 12d. a Roll.
Note, one Roll serves one Person near half a year.' And
then the famous 'Spanish Blacking' advertised, and called
the poor ' Fucus ' names.
   The little odds and ends of male attire must be noted.
Gloves, for instance, were in constant use, and we have seen
how prodigally they were given away at funerals. The ire
of the Spectator was aroused by a custom,
then just brought up, of edging them with
silver fringe, but this luxurious practice
does not seem to have obtained for very
long.
   The pocket-handkerchiefs, owing to the
prevalence of the prac-
tice of snuff-taking, were
nearly always of silk,
though cambric was used;
and although we do not
hear of 'Moral Pocket-
handkerchiefs,' they were
somewhat similarly util-
ised, as the following advertisement shows: 'A Silk Handker-
chief Printed, with a Draught of the Roads of England accord-
ing to Mr. Ogleby's Survey, shewing the Roads and distance in
measured Miles from London to the several Cities and Towns
in England. Also the Victory Handkerchief, which gives an
account of the Success of 5 most glorious Victories obtain'd
by the Confederates over the French. Ornamented with the
Arms of the Empire and Great Britain, Prussia and Holland:

and ensigns taken from the French, with the queen's effigies

advertised in Anne's reign was one printed on white silk with
'An Abstract of the Peace made between England and
France, with the lively Effigies of all the Confederates,
Princes and the several Plenipotentiaries at Utrecht.'
   In the early part of Anne's reign it was fashionable for
men to wear muffs, as it had been ever since Charles the
Second's time. Ward (1703) says: ' What is he in the long
Whig, with his Fox skin Muff upon his Button, and his
Pocket book in his Hand? Why he (replied my school-
fellow) is a Beau.'  But they seem to have become less
popular in 1710 (vide Tatler, No. 155). 'I saw he was
reduced to extreme poverty, by certain shabby superfluities
in his dress: for, notwithstanding that it was a very sultry
day for the time of the year, he wore a loose great Coat
and a Muff,' etc.  Yet in 1711 Addison writes (Spectator,
No. 16): 'I have receiv'd a Letter, desiring me to be very
satyrical upon the little Muff that is now in Fashion.'
   Every gentleman carried a sword, and we are able to get
accurate descriptions of them, from the very numerous de-
scriptions of them in the advertisements of lost and stolen
swords-how they used to lose them ! Probably the company
at the tavern or club was jovial, the claret good, and the way
home was badly lit, and in the morning the silver-hilted
sword was a-missing. I wonder if they ever got them back ?
They cried after them loudly enough, although they did not
offer great rewards, a guinea or so at the outside. Gay thus
warns the walker in the streets:-

           Where the Mob gathers, swiftly shoot along,
           Nor idly mingle in the noisy Throng.
           Lur'd by the Silver Hilt, amid the Swarm,
           The subtil Artist will thy Side disarm.

With a beau, his sword, as every other part of his dress, re-
ceived his special attention, and he very seldom was without
it, except when dancing.  His sword-knot was of some gay
colour, and was very long; and he was solicitous as to the
carriage of his sword. 'But my sword-does it hang care-
less?' asks Bookwit in the 'Lying Lover'; and yet withal
the hilts very seldom seem to have been of much value, either

diamond-cut steel, gilt, or plain silver hilts. The following
are some of the better sort, and of the most artistic merit.
' A large plain Silver hilted Sword with Scrowls and gilt in
parts, with a broad gutter'd hollow Blade gilt at the shoulder,
and the edges ground very sharp and a strong silver gilt
handle.' 'A Hanger with a fine Aggat Haft, Belt, and Silver
buckle.' 'A Silver gilt Sword, done with several Figures,
with a Chequer Gold handle done one half of it with a Black
Ribbon.' 'A Silver and Gold Hilted Sword wrought with
Figures and Images about the handle, being tyed with a
broad black Ribbon, the Blade broad from the Hilt halfway,
and stain'd with blew and Gold.' ' A Silver and Gold hilted
Sword of a Trophy Pattern, with a man on Horseback on the
Middle of the Pommel, and the same in the Shell, with the
Figures lying down on each side of the Horse, the Button of
the Pommel being in Squares.'
   Here is an advertisement which shows how a poor inno-
cent was led astray: 'June 24, 1712. Whereas a Gentleman
coming to Bradbery's Hazard Table last Night, and not a
Gamester, but brought by an Acquaintance to see the Nature
of it, lost his Silver hilted Sword, which some of the Company
took from his side; This is to give Notice that any body that
produces the Sword to Mr. John Waters, Perfumer, in the
Strand, over against the Talbot Inn; or to Mr. Hosier, over
against the Bunch of Grapes in New Street, Fetter Lane,
shall have 10s. Reward, and no Questions ask'd; and if the
Sword is not produc'd, the Man that keeps the Table will be
indited.'
   Towards the end of Anne's reign swords were worn of a
preposterous length, which excited the satire of the Guardian.l
'When Jack Lizard made his first trip to town from the
university, he thought he could never bring up with him
enough of the gentleman; this I soon perceived in the first
visit he made me, when I remember, he came scraping in at
the door, encumbered with a bar of Cold iron so irksomely
long, that it banged against his Calf, and jarred upon his
right heel, as he Walked, and came rattling behind him as he
ran down the stairs. But his sister Annabella's raillery soon
                    1 Guardian, No. 143.







158    SOCIAL LIFE in the reign of QUEEN ANNE.



cured him of this awkward air, by telling him that his sword
was only fit for going up stairs, or walking up hill, and that
she shrewdly suspected he had stolen it out of the College
kitchen.'
   Equal, at least, in importance to the sword, was the cane,
' the nice conduct' of which was part of a gentleman's educa-
tion-and, if swords were plentifully lost or stolen, how many
more despairing owners mourned their canes? There were
useful, as well as ornamental canes.
         If the Strong Cane support thy walking Hand,
         Chairmen no longer shall the Wall command;
         Ev'n sturdy Car-men shall thy Nod obey,
         And rattling Coaches stop to make thee Way:
         This shall direct thy Cautious Tread aright,
         Though not one glaring Lamp enliven Night.
         Let Beaus their Canes with Amber tipt produce,
         Be theirs for empty Show, but thine for use. l

The majority of those lost were hardly worth advertising
for; but we will pick out a few, as specimens of what the
better sort were like: 'A fine Cane with a Gold Head, en-
graved with a Cypher and Crown on the top of it.' 'A Cane
with an Aggot head.' 'A small cane with an Amber head
and a Black Silk Ribbond in it, a Princes Metal Hoop, and a
Silver Ferril at the bottom.' 'A Cane with a Silver Head
and a Black Ribbon in it, the top of it Amber, crack'd in two
or three places, part of the Head to turn round, and in it a
Perspective Glass.' 'A Cane with a croched Head, a Silver
Ferrel and a Silver ring.' 'A Cane with a Silver Head, with
the Figure of the Tower of Babel upon it, done in Chaced
Work.' 'A Cane with a Silver Head and Scent Box, and a
Ferril of Silver at the Bottom.'
   His snuff-box, too, was an object of his solicitude, though,
as the habit of taking snuff had but just come into vogue,
there were no collections of them, and no beau had ever
dreamed of criticising a box as did Lord Petersham, as 'a
nice Summer box.' So many of them have come down to us
that they need no description, and I may merely say that
those of the middle classes were chiefly of silver, or tortoise-
                          1 Trivia, book 1.

shell, or mother-of-pearl; sometimes of 'Aggat'-or with a
'Moco Stone' in the lid. A beau would sometimes either
have a looking-glass, or the portrait of a lady inside
the lid.
    We have seen how proud the beau was of his watch, which
he wore in a fob, or pocket, in his breeches. A seal or two,
generally of small value, and a watch key, were attached to
it by a ribbon; chains, either of gold, silver, or steel, being
sparingly used. The seals, of course, were then necessary,
as, there being no gummed envelopes, every letter had to be
properly sealed, either by wax or wafer. Tompion was the
great watch-maker, and he lived at
the Three Crowns, at the corner of
Water Lane in Fleet Street, where he
was afterwards succeeded by George
Graham. The value of Tompion's
watches may be gathered from the
fact that from seven to ten guineas
were generally offered for their reco-
very when lost, or from eighteen to
twenty-five guineas of our money.
   The watch of that day, and indeed
of the whole Georgian era, consisted of
the watch proper, and an outer orna-
mental case, which was lined with a
pad of coloured velvet or satin, to
make it fit tight to the watch. We
now never see watch-cases made of
other materials than the precious metals, or imitations thereof;
but then, beautiful cases were made of shagreen of various
colours, or tortoiseshell inlaid, or studded, with gold. Some
beautiful specimens may be seen in the library of the Cor-
poration of the City of London, in the Clockmakers' Com-
pany's collection.
   As umbrellas were not used by men, as being too effe-
minate, and india-rubber waterproofing was only to be
discovered more than a century later, men, in Anne's
reign, had to put their trust in good broadcloth coats or
cloaks.

    Scarlet seems to have been the favourite colour for the
roquelaure or cloak, and some must have been 'exceeding
magnifical,' scarlet rocklows and rocliers, with gold buttons
and loops, being advertised as lost. Ah! the men of that
time! they were always losing something.
   In doors, in their hours of ease, the precious furbelow wig
was discarded, and their closely cropped or shaved heads
were clad in handsomely worked caps-called night caps,
although only worn in the daytime; some kind of night cap
having been an article of dress ever since the time of Eliza-
beth. They were as common presents from ladies to gentle-
men, as a pair of slippers, or a smoking-cap would be now.
Says Swift, 'Your fine Cap, Madam Dingley, is too little, and
too hot. I will have that fur taken off; I wish it were far
enough; and my old Velvet cap is good for nothing. Is it
velvet under the fur ? I was feeling but cannot find; if it be,
it will do without it, else I will face it; but then I must buy
new velvet: but may be I may beg a piece. What shall
I do?'3
   The loose dressing gown, too, was called a night gown-

why, I know not, because it was not worn at night. 'You
must know I am in my night gown every morning betwixt
six and seven, and Patrick is forced to ply me fifty times
before I can get on my nightgown.' 1 They were made of
costly materials as well as 'Callicoe'; indeed, they were
generally of brocade, or some embroidered material. Men
used even, early in the day, to lounge into the coffee-houses
dressed in them. One example will show both their price

clothes man, a picture of him will as appropriately close this
portion of the disquisition on male dress, as one of his mate
will open that on female costume.

THE 'commode' must have

XIV., and was there called
a fontange because it had
been introduced by Made-
moiselle Fontange.1 It was
also named a 'head,' or a
'top knot,' and was made of
rows of plaited muslin, or
lace, stiffened with wire, one
over the other, diminishing
as they rose.  During the
reign, their fashion and shape
altered very much, as is no-

in Nature as a Lady's Head Dress: Within my own Me-
mory I have known it rise and fall above thirty Degrees,
About ten years ago it shot up to a very great Height, inso-
much that the Female Part of our Species were much taller
than the men. 1   The numerous examples given in the illus-
trations of this book render any further reference to the
'commode' unnecessary, as the reader will there see it de-
picted in every stage. The cut on the preceding page is only
given because it shows it on a larger scale than any other,
and is, besides, interesting, as forming one of a pack of cards
(1707).
    Ward give us his definition of a Belle, or 'Modish Lady,'
as he prefers to call her, who was-
            At Hackney, Stepney, or at Chealsea Bred,
            In Dancing perfect and in Plays well Read.

            Impatient of Extreams, with Pride half Craz'd,
            Then must her Head, a Story higher be rais'd.
            In her next Gaudy Gown, her Sweeping Train
            Is order'd to be made as long again;
            All things must vary from the common Rode,
            And reach a Size beyond the Decent Mode:
            Thus Monstrously Adorn'd, to make a show,
            She walks in State, and Courtsies very low,
            And is a proper Mistress for the Fool, a Beau. 2

   We get a very good, and at the same time humorous,
description of female dress in 1707 out of Mrs. Centlivre's
play of' The Platonick Lady,' wherein one of the characters
is Mrs. Dowdy, 'a Somersetshire Widow, come to Town to
learn Breeding.'

Act. 3. Enter Mrs. Dowdy, Mrs. Brazon the Matchmaker, Mrs. Wheedle
   the Milliner, Mrs. Turnup the Manto Maker, Mrs. Crispit the Tire
   Woman, and Peeper, her Maid. They all seem Talking to her.
   Mrs. Dowdy. We'l, we'l la you now, la you now, Shour and Shour
you'l Gally me.
   Turnup. Here's your Ladyships Manto and Petticoat.
   Mrs. Dowdy. Ladyship, why what a main difference is here between
this Town and the Country. I was never call'd above Forsooth in all my

Louis XIV., who begged her to keep it so arranged for the remainder of the day
-a hint not wasted on the other ladies, who next day appeared 'coiffees a la
Fontange.'      1 Spectator, No. 98, June 21, 1711.  2 London Spy.

she has cut it in a Thousand Bits.
   Peeper. Oh, that's the Fashion, these are Furbelows Madam-'tis the
prettiest made Coat.
   Mrs. Dowdy, Furbelows, a murrain take 'em, they spoil all the Zilk.
Good strange, shour London Women do nothing but study Vashions,
they never mind their Dairy I warrant 'em.
   Turnup. Ladies have no other employment for their Brain-and our
Art lies in hiding the defects of Nature. Furbelows upwards, were
devised for those that have no Hips, and too large ones, brought up
the full bottom'd Furbelows.
   Milliner. And a long Neck and a hollow Breast, first made use of the
Stinkirk-and here's a delicate one for your Ladyship. I have a Book
in my pocket just come from France, Intituled, The Elements of the
Toylet.
   Mrs. Dowdy. Elements, mercy on me! what do they get up in the
Sky now?
   Peeper. A Learned Author to be sure,-let me see that, Mrs. Wheedle.
   Milliner. Here, Mrs. Peeper, 'tis the Second Volume; the first only
shews an Alphabetical Index of the most notable Pieces which enter into
the Composition of a Commode.
   Mrs. Dowdy. Well, I shall ne'er mind these hard Names; Oh Sirs,
Peeper, what swinging Cathedral Headgeer is this ?
   Peeper. Oh, Modish French Night Clothes; Madam, what's here-all
sorts of dresses painted to the Life. Ha, ha, ha, head cloaths to shorten
the Face. Favourites to raise the Forehead-to heighten flat cheeks
flying Cornets-four Pinners to help narrow Foreheads and long Noses,
and very forward, to make the Eyes look Languishing.
   Mrs. Dowdy. Ay-that, Peeper, double it down, I love Languishing.
   Peeper. Take it and read it at your leisure, Madam.
   Mrs. Dowdy. I shall never ha done shour zeeing all my vine things.
Hy day, what's these two pieces of Band Box for?
   Turnup. 'Tis Past board, Madam, for your Ladyship's Rump. 1
   Mrs. Dowdy. A Rump, ho, ho, ho, has Cousin Isbel a Rump, Peeper?
   Peeper. Certainly Madam.
   Mrs. Dowdy. If Cousin has one, as I hope to be kiss'd, I'll have it,
Mrs. Turnup.

    It is hardly within the scope of this work to follow the
varying fashions of the reign, so one more extract must
suffice.  It is from 'The Humours of the Army,' by Charles
Shadwell (a son, or nephew, of the Poet Laureate, 1713):
' But there are some fashionable Creatures at the other End
of the Town, that give great Hopes of their being very odd
   1 The extremely bouffee furbelows were called rumpt furbelows, and the
brooches inserted in the centre were called rump jewels or rumphlets.

and Whimsical; for their Head dresses are no bigger than
the Skull-caps they us'd to wear; their Petticoats are up to
their knees; their Stays up to their chins; and their Fans
up to their Nostrils; and the mody Shrug makes 'em wear
their Shoulders up to their Ears; their Lappets reach down
to the Frenching of their Petticoats, which are widen'd with
Abundance of Whalebone; They stoop forward when they
should walk upright; they shuffle along a tip Toe, curtsey
on one Side, smile on those they would ridicule, and look
very grave on their intimate acquaintances.'

           Begin my Muse and sing in Epick Strain
           The PETTICOAT; (nor shalt thou sing in vain,
           The PETTICOAT will sure reward thy Pain !)

   Before its introduction, women to improve their figures,
or to follow the fashion, wore false hips, but these speedily
disappeared when the hooped petticoat made its appearance,
about 1709. Addison wrote a very funny paper, a mock trial
of it,2 in which the arguments for and against are duly heard,
and he winds up his judgment with 'I consider women as a
beautiful romantic animal, that may be adorned with furs and
feathers, pearls and diamonds, ores and silks. The lynx
shall cast its skin at her feet to make her a tippet; the pea-
cock, parrot and swan shall pay contribution to her muff, the
sea shall be searched for shells, and the rocks for gems; and
every part of nature furnish out its share towards the em-
bellishment of a creature that is the most consummate work
of it. All this I shall indulge them in; but as for the petti-
coat I have been speaking of, I neither can nor will allow it.'
Vain, idle words! the fashion crept on, until under the Georges
it was absolutely outrageous. At present it was a somewhat
mild hooping of whalebone, compressible-at least such was
the under framework; for the word petticoat meant the skirt
of the dress-over which was the furbelow. They were made
of varied and rich materials; one example will serve to
illustrate: ' Stolen &amp;c. A Cloth Colour Gown and Petticoat
of Grazet, an Ash Coloured Grazet Gown and Petticoat, a

Hair Colour plush Petticoat, a black Russel Petticoat flower'd,
an Ash colour Silk Quilted Petticoat, a Cloth Colour'd Silk
Sattinet Gown and Petticoat,' &amp;c.
   The bodices were laced, open in front, over very tight
stays, showing them; and they varied in material from 'a
pair of stays cover'd with Black Tabby Stitched, lin'd with
Flannel,' to one 'with 8 diamond Buckles and Tags,' for
which Sir Richard Hoare, of the Golden Bottle in Fleet
Street, would give the finder twelve guineas. The bodices
were worn low, showing the bosom-which, however, was
partially concealed by the' tucker' or 'modesty piece,' which
was an edging going round the top of the dress and front of
the bosom. In 1713 this was beginning to be discontinued,
and deep, and many, were the growls over it in the Guardian.
   The sleeves of the bodice were somewhat short (only
coming a little below the bend of the arm), and were worn
hanging, to show the white muslin, or lace, hanging sleeve,
which came nearly to the wrist-a very pretty fashion; and
an apron was worn, made somewhat ornamental by frill-
ing, etc.
   This formed the outward costume of a lady; only some-
times it was of extremely rich material, vide the following:
'Stolen out of the house of Mr. Peter Paggen in Love Lane
near Eastcheap . . . One Isabella colour Kincob Gown
flowered with Green and Gold, one Silver lace half Ell deep;
One Silver Orrice a quarter of a Yard deep; A large Parcel of
Black and Silver Fringe; One dark colour Cloth Gown and
Petticoat with 2 Silver Orrices; One Purple and Gold Atlas
Gown; One Scarlet and Gold Atlas Petticoat edged with
Silver; One wrought under Petticoat edged with Gold; one
Black Velvet Petticoat; three Black and White Norwich
Stuff Gowns and Petticoats; One Black fine Cloth Gown
and 2 Petticoats; One White Satin Gown lined with Black
Silk; One Alejah Petticoat striped with Green, Gold, and
White; One Silver Net half Yard deep; One White Sarsnet
Scarf; Two Yards of White and Gold Atlas; one Blue and
Silver Silk Gown and Petticoat; One Blue and Gold Atlas
Gown and Petticoat; Two Silver Laces each a quarter of a
Yard deep, One yellow Chintz Gown and Petticoat, one

Workt Petticoat; one White Holland Gown and Petticoat
drawn for Stitchin; One pair of Shoes and Clogs laced with
Silver; One dark Colour Cloth Petticoat with a Silver Orrice,
one White Sarsnet Scarf,' etc.
   Of ladies' underlinen we get a glimpse in the following:
'Lost &amp;c., a deal box containing 4 fine Holland Shifts, 7 fine
Cambric Handkerchiefs, 2 Night rails and Aprons, one with
edging and the other flowered, 2 yards of fine loopt Macklen
Lace, one Suit of Muslen Lace Night Cloaths, 2 Holland
Wastcoats, 3 Diaper Towels, One Powder Box and 6 combs.'
   The stockings were either of thread or silk; in the latter
case they were sometimes of bright colours. We have already
seen how the little temptress of the New Exchange asked,
' Does not your Lady want . . . fine green Silk Stockings?'
The shoes were beautifully made, of satin or silk, embroidered,
or of fine Morocco leather, with high heels.
   Oddly enough, even in those days, which we are some-
how inclined to clothe in idyllic simplicity, women dressed
like men, as far as they could. Budgell notes this: 'They
already appear in Hats and Feathers, Coats and Perriwigs.'1
And Addison points out to them2 that if their design in so
doing is to 'smite more effectually their Male Beholders,'
they are mistaken, for 'how would they be affected should
they meet a Man on Horseback, in his Breeches and Jack
Boots, and at the same time dressed up in a Commode and a
Night raile?'
   The same little feminine vanities existed then as now.
We had a glance at the cosmetics and scents, so will only
just give one more illustration which supplies some then
missing  scents.  'I have choice good  Gloves, Amber,
Orangery, Gensa, Romane, Frangipand, Nerol, Tuberose,
Jessimine and Marshal. All manner of Tires for the Head,
Locks, Frowzes and so forth;'3 so that they were not
altogether independent of the barber's art as regards false
hair.

   The mode of coiffure was far less pretentious than in suc-
ceeding reigns. When
a cap or commode was
worn, the hair, except
in front, was almost en-
tirely concealed. When
worn without a cap, as
in the house-especially
for dress occasions-it
was rolled, as in the
accompanying illustra-
tion, in a style both
elegant and informal.
   That curious prac-
tice of patching the face
was in force, but was
used in greater modera-
tion than either in the
reign of Charles I., when
suns, moons, stars, and
even coaches and four
were cut out of sticking plaister, and stuck on the face,
and even the mercers patched, to show the effect to their
customers-or in the Georgian era, when the face was covered
with a sooty eruption.  The effect on a pretty face, as shown

in the accompanying illustration, is far from unpleasant. But
it was an art, and required judgment.

louks just like a Plumb Cake var all the World,'2 whilst they
possibly might call forth some uncomplimentary remarks, such
as 'You pert Baggages, you think you are very handsome now,
I warrant you. What a devil's this pound of hair upon your
paltry frowses for? what a pox are those patches for? what,
are your faces sore ? I'd not kiss a Lady of this Age, by the
Mass, I'd rather kiss my Horse.'3
   Misson notes the difference between his countrywomen
and ours. 'The Use of Patches is not unknown to the

French Ladies; but she that wears them must be young and
handsome. In England, young, old, handsome, ugly, all are
bepatch'd till they are Bed-rid. I have often counted fifteen
Patches or more upon the swarthy wrinkled Phiz of an old
Hag threescore and ten, and upwards. Thus the English
Women refine upon our Fashions.'
    One would hardly imagine that this fashion could have
been pressed into the service of party passion, but so it was,
if Addison was not jesting-and, after all, perhaps it is not
so astonishing, when we recollect that the Tory ladies stayed
away from the Queen's Drawing Room-on her Majesty's
birthday too-because she gave a flattering reception, and a
costly sword, to Prince Eugene: 'About the Middle of last
Winter I went to see an Opera at the Theatre in the Hay-
market, where I could not but take notice of two Parties of
very fine Women, that had placed themselves in the opposite
Side Boxes, and seemed drawn up in a kind of Battle Array
one against another. After a short Survey of them, I found
they were Patch'd differently; the Faces on one Hand being
spotted on the right Side of the Forehead, and those upon
the other, on the Left. I quickly perceived that they cast
Hostile Glances upon one another; and that their Patches
were placed in those different Situations, as Party Signals to
distinguish Friends from Foes. In the Middle Boxes, be-
tween these two opposite Bodies, were several Ladies who
Patched indifferently on both Sides of their Faces, and seem'd
to sit there with no other Intention but to see the Opera.
Upon Inquiry I found that the Body of Amazons on my
right Hand were Whigs, and those on my Left, Tories: And
that those who had placed themselves in the Middle Boxes
were a Neutral Party, whose Faces had not yet declared
themselves.  These last however, as I afterwards found,
diminished daily, and took their Party with one Side or the
Other; insomuch that I observed in several of them, the
Patches, which were before dispersed equally, are now all gone
over to the Whig or Tory side of the Face.'1
   It has been noticed that masks were used in the country
by ladies when taking horse exercise; in fact, it was a sub-

stitute for the modern veil; and, in previous reigns, it had
been used generally out of doors. But in Anne's time it had
got to be associated with disreputable females, so much so
that at concerts, and at Powel's puppet show, no person
wearing a mask was admitted. They were still worn at the
theatres, but scarcely by ladies. Still they were worn some-
times even by them, on the first night of a play, in case there
might be any allusion, which might afterwards be excised,
which would make them blush. They were not expensive
luxuries.

   Seeing the class by whom they were worn, people having
them on were naturally liable to insult. The following illus-
                        trates the manners of the time:
                        'An Arch Country Bumpkin having
                        pick'd up a Frog in some of the
                        adjacent Ditches, peeping into the
                        Coach as he pass'd by, and being
                        very much affronted that they hid
                        their Faces with their Masks, Ads
                        blood, Says he, you look as ugly
                        in those black Vizards as my Toad
                        here; e'en get you all together,
                        tossing on't into the Coach: At
                        which the frightened Lady birds
                        Squeak'd out, open'd the Coach
Doors, and leap'd among the throng, to shun their loathsome
Companion.'2
   Of course, when the commode was worn, no other head-
covering could be worn with it; but, when it came to be lowered,
and almost disappear, a graceful fashion came up of scarves or
hoods, and thus bright colours are alluded to more than once
by contemporary writers, especially in the Spectator 3:  I
took notice of a little Cluster of Women sitting together in
the prettiest colour'd Hoods that I ever saw One of them
was Blue, another Yellow, and another Philomot ;4 the fourth

was of a Pink Colour, and the fifth was of a pale Green. I
looked with as much pleasure upon this little party Coloured
Assembly, as upon a Bed of Tulips, and did not know at first
whether it might not be an Embassy of Indian Queens,' etc.
Whatever made Steele attack the hood as he did in a manner
so scurrilous, and utterly unlike him ?-though, after all, his
objurgations are directed more against the cloak than the
hood.
          Your Hoods and Cloaths or rather Riding Hoods
          Were first invented to steal People's Goods-
          For when their Wearers came with a Pretence
          To Buy-Tho' looking with much Innocence,
          Lace, Silk, or Muslin privately they steal
          And under those same Cloaks their Theft Conceal.1

    The tall broad-brimmed hat (which still exists in Wales,
only made in beaver) of James the First's reign was still
used by country women, and the poorer class in towns.
Ward, talking of an 'Assembly of Fat Motherly Flat Caps'
at Billingsgate, says: 'Their Chief clamour was against High
Heads and Patches; and said it would have been a very
good Law, if Q. Mary had effected her design, and brought
the proud Minks's of the Town, to have worn High Crownd
Hats instead of Top Knots.'2 And in 'Tunbridge Walks':
' Oh! the joys of a Country life, to mind one's Poultry, and
one's Dairy, and the pretty business of milking a Cow, then,
the soft diversions of riding on Horseback, or going to a Bull
baiting, and the Charming Conversation of High Crown'd
Hats, who can talk of nothing but their Hogs and their
Husbands.'
   Furs were worn, and of course duly lost. From one
advertisement we get to know the name of 'a Sable Tippit
or Zar'; and from another we learn something of its shape,
'a round Sable Tippet, about 2 yards long, the Sable pretty
deep and dark, with a piece of black Silk in the Square of the
neck.' They also had muffs, not only of feathers, as we have
already seen, but of fur of all sorts, from otter skin to' the
Cats' fur. But ladies did not go out more than they could

help, either in cold or wet weather. The streets were so bad,
and, although to them was accorded the 'umberellow' (for it
was far too effeminate a thing for men to carry, no Jonas
Hanway having yet arisen), yet they did not stir out unless
obliged; and it was only
         The tuck'd up sempstress walks with hasty strides
         While Streams run down her oil'd umbrella's sides.1

   Curious clumsy things these old umbrellas must have
been. For a man to have used one, he would have deserved,
and received, some such satire as 'The Young gentleman
                                belonging to the Custom
                                House, that for fear of rain
                                borrowed the Umbrella at

          Good Huswives all the Winter's Rage despise,
          Defended by the Riding Hood's Disguise;
          Or underneath th' Umbrella's oily Shed,

          Or sweating Slaves support the shady Load,

          Britain in Winter only knows its Aid,
          To guard from chilly Show'rs the walking Maid.

          That female Implement shall grace thy Lays;
          Say from what Art Divine th' Invention came,
          And from its Origine deduce the name.3

   And then Gay tells the legend of how Vulcan fell in love
with Martha (or Patty), the daughter of a Lincolnshire yeoman;
how to save her feet from the cold and wet he studded her
shoes with nails; but still she had a cold and lost her voice,

until he hit upon the happy idea of the 'patten,' the use of
which completely restored her to health, and

          The Patten now supports each frugal Dame,
          Which from the blue ey'd Patty takes the name.

   But we must not forget that potent weapon in woman's
armoury, the fan.

          The Fan shall flutter in all Female Hands,
          And various Fashions learn from various lands,
          For this, shall Elephants their Iv'ry shed;
          And polished Sticks the waving Engine spread:
          His clouded Mail the Tortoise shall resign,
          And round the Rivet pearly Circles shine.
          On this shall Indians all their Art employ,
          And with bright Colours stain the gaudy Toy;
          Their Paint shall Here in wildest Fancies flow,
          Their Dress, their Customs, their Religion show,
          So shall the British Fair their minds improve,
          And on the Fan to distant Climates rove.
          Here shall the Chinese Dame her Pride display,
          And silver Figures gild her loose Array;
          She boasts her little Feet and winking Eyes,
          And tunes the Fife, or tinkling Cymbal plies;
          Here Cross leg'd Nobles in rich State shall dine,
          When on the Floor large painted Vessels shine,
          For These, 0 China, shall thy Realms be sought,
          With These, shall Europe's mighty Ships be fraught,
          Thy glitt'ring Earth shall tempt their Ladies Eyes,
          Who for thy brittle Jars shall Gold despise.
          Gay France shall make the Fan her Artists' Care,
          And with the Costly Trinket arm the Fair.

          While Widows seek once more the Nuptial State,
          And wrinkled Maids repent their Scorn too late,
          As long as youthful Swains shall Nymphs deceive,
          And easie Nymphs those youthful Swains believe,
          While Beaus in Dress consume the tedious Morn,
          So long the Fan shall Female Hands adorn.1

   To anyone interested in the use of the fan at this period,
a perusal of Addison's article in the Spectator (No. 102) is
recommended: it is too long for reproduction here, and
would be thoroughly spoilt by merely making use of extracts
                     1 The Fan, by Gay, ed. 1714.

from it. They seem to have been seldom lost, or if so, were
not of sufficient value to advertise-in fact, I have only met
with one advertisement, 'A painted Landskip Fann, cutt,
gilded Sticks,' and for this a reward of 7s. 6d. was offered.
That they were largely imported is evident by the following
notice: 'For Sale by the Candle, at the Marine Coffee House
in Birchin Lane &amp;c.-Forty Thousand    Fans of Sundry
Sorts;' but these most probably were either Chinese,
Japanese, or Indian palm fans.
    Before closing the subject of women's costumes the 'Mob'
must be noticed-that dress of which Swift writes: 'The
ladies were all in Mobs; how do you call it ?-undressed.' 1
This negligent costume, of which no actual contemporary
description seems to exist, is never mentioned except to be
decried-as, for instance, the question is asked, 'How is a
man likely to relish his wife's society when he comes home
and finds her slovenly, in a Mob?' And there were one or
two other articles of dress not usually mentioned, and not
described, as 'Women's laced Head Cloaths commonly called
Quaker's Pinners' and 'Dowds.'
   What woman could exist without shopping nowadays ?
And the habit was the same among the ladies of Queen
Anne's time. The Female Tatler (1709) gives us the fol-
lowing graphic description of shopping: 'This afternoon
some ladies, having an opinion of my fancy in Cloaths,
desired me to accompany them to Ludgate Hill, which I
take it to be as agreeable an amusement as a lady can pass
away three or four hours in. The shops are perfect gilded
theatres, the variety of wrought silks so many changes of fine
scenes, and the Mercers are the performers in the Opera;
and instead of "vivitur ingenio," you have in gold capitals
"No trust by retail." They are the sweetest, fairest, nicest,
dished out creatures; and by their elegant and soft speeches,
you would guess them to be Italians. As people glance
within their doors, they salute them with-Garden silks,
ladies, Italian Silks, brocades, tissues, cloth of Silver, or cloth
of Gold, very fine Mantua Silks, any right Geneva velvet,
English velvet, velvet embossed. And to the meaner sort-

Fine thread satins both striped and plain, fine mohair silk,
satinnets, burdets, Persianets, Norwich Crapes, anterines,
silks for hoods and scarves, hair camlets, druggets or saga-
thies, gentlemen's nightgowns ready made, shallons, durances,
and right Scotch plaids.
    'We went into a shop which had three partners; two of
them were to flourish out their silks; and after an obliging
smile and a pretty mouth made, Cicero like, to expatiate on
their goodness; and the other's sole business was to be
gentleman usher of the shop, to stand completely dressed
at the door, bow to all the coaches that pass by, and hand
ladies out and in.
    'We saw abundance of gay fancies, fit for Sea Captain's
wives, Sheriff's feasts, and Taunton dean ladies. l This,
Madam, is wonderfully charming.      This, Madam, is so
diverting a Silk. This, Madam-my stars! how cool it
looks.  But this, Madam.-Ye Gods! would I had 10,000
yards of it! Then gathers up a sleeve, and places it to your
shoulders. It suits your Ladyship's face wonderfully well.
When we had pleased ourselves, and bid him ten shillings a
yard for what he asked fifteen; Fan me, ye winds, your
lady ship rallies me! should I part with it at such a price,
the weavers would rise upon the very Shop. Was you at
the Park last night, Madam ? Your ladyship shall abate me
sixpence. Have you read the Tatler to day ? &amp;c.
   'These fellows are positively the greatest fops in the
kingdom; they have their toilets and their fine night gowns;
their chocolate in the morning, and their green tea two hours
after; Turkey polts for their dinner; and their perfumes,
washes, and clean linen, equip them for the Parade.'
   We get a glimpse at the prices of silk dresses in the
following advertisement: 'The Silk Gowns formerly sold in
Exchange Alley, are removed to the sign of the Hood and
Scarf, directly over against Will's Coffee House in Cornhill,
where any Gentleman or Lady may be furnished with any

1  Why Taunton dean ladies I am at a loss to say, unless, as Somersetshire was
then considered as the 'ultima Thule' of civilisation, it is meant that the dresses
were as fine and gaudy as a country belle would wear, in contradistinction to the
better taste of her town-bred sister.

Brocades of 7 Guineas Price to Thread Sattin Gowns of

   Besides the stuffs described in the Female Tatler, there
were 'Silver Tishea, Pudsway Silks, Shaggs, Tabbeys,

   Having a Queen upon the throne-one that kept her
Court, and dressed well-lace was naturally an article in
demand. The Queen was somewhat moderate at her Corona-
tion, for her point lace only came to 64 13s. 9d. It was
Flanders lace, and was allowed to be imported, provided it
was not made in 'the dominions of the French king.' Mechlin
and Brussels lace first made their appearance in this reign,
and, in 171O, the Queen paid 151 for twenty-six yards of
fine edged Brussels lace. Indeed, Brussels lace was some-
what dear: 'One Brussels Head is valued at 40; a grounded
Brussels head 30; one looped Brussels 30.' 'Lost be-
twixt Hemming's Row and Owin Street near Leicester Fields,
a Tin Box with Lace; whoever brings it to Mrs. Beck at the
Angel and Star in Fleet Street shall have 10 Reward and no
Questions ask'd.' '9 pieces of fine Bone Lace belonging to
a Person of Quality' were also lost, and 10 reward offered.
This lace does not always seem to have been made of thread,
for, 'Whereas two pieces of Silver Bone lace, was brought to
a shop in Winchester Street to be weighed, the Lace being
suppos'd to be stol'n, is stoped.' Four pieces of' Macklin'
lace, lost, induced a reward of five guineas, and the finder
of three pieces of 'Brussels edging Lace' is supposed to be
tempted by the offer of 10s. to bring them back.
   We have read in the robbery from Mr. Paggen's of a
number of garments with gold and silver lace, and with
silver ' Orrices,' and the use of bullion lace grew to such an
extent, that in 1711, its entry was forbidden under pain of
forfeiture, and a fine of 100.
   The linen of this reign was finer, and better, than in those
preceding, and one linen draper of the time has handed his
name down to posterity, viz. 'Thomas Doyley at the Nun
in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden.' A list of the linens
then in vogue, is, as far as I can learn, as follows: 'White and
Brown Osnabrigs, Dowlas's, Kentings, Muslins, Bed ticks,
Garlets, Spotted Lawns, Sietias, Harford Blue, White Shorks,
Holland, Cambricks, Gentings, Callicoes, Damask, Diaper,
Huckabacks, Dimmities.'
   Of these 'fine double threaded Cottons for Sheetings' was
12d. per yard and muslin 5s. 6d.

   The 'Tally Man' was an institution in those days, and
was well known. His handbills remain, and there is a
singular unanimity among them; with one voice they make
Monday the day for purchases and payments. The reason
for this is obvious; at that early period of the week the
Saturday's earnings ought not to be spent. As a rule, the
terms were, 'Paying one shilling a Week for Thirty Shillings,
untill the Sum is paid for which they Contract.' One gentle-
man sticks up for his dignity, and begs you to ' Note. That
these goods are not to be sold by a Tally man, but the
Money is to be taken by Weekly, or Monthly Payments,
according as it shall be agreed upon for the Ease of the
Customers.' This system was as pernicious then as now,
only, as the law of arrest for debt was in full force, the
prisons held plenty of victims.
   It was not a particularly ostentatious age for jewellery,
and we can get a good idea of what was worn, by one or two
advertisements of lost property. 'Stolen the 11 th of this
Instant February 1703 1 between 6 and 7 of the clock at night,

one Smaller Gold Medal with two Heads. Several Stone

   There was lost a very interesting memorial ring, to which,
in those Jacobite days, no doubt a particular value was
attached. 'A Gold ring with 7 Diamonds in the form of a

   Diamonds were much worn, and frequently lost. For the
following, a reward of 10 per cent. of their value was offered.
'Lost &amp;c. 42 loose Diamonds, some of them large, belonging
to a Necklace, and two with holes made behind for Screws to
be put in, all strung on a white silk; and two Tags with 16
small Diamonds.' For the next 100l. was offered, or pro-
portionate sums for portions. ' Lost by a Person of Quality,

a Diamond Cross of 6 Brilliant Diamonds and a large
Brilliant Stone loose in a Collet. The middle stone in the
Cross weighs 10 grains, and the other 5 together 29 grains,
and the Diamond in the Collet 15 grains or there abouts.'
   The greatest loss of diamonds in this reign was the follow-
ing, for which a reward of 1,000 guineas, and the Queen's
pardon, was offered. ' Whereas there were brought from India
in the Ship Albemarle (which was driven ashore at Pielpora
near Plimouth about the 9th of this instant December) Five
Bulses of Diamonds, which are pretending to be missing or
lost. . . . Amongst which said Diamonds was one very un-
common, remarkable Diamond, viz. One cut Table Stone of
the first Water, and in all Perfection, weighing about 26
Carrats and a Quarter, and one Pointed rough Stone weighing
about 18 Carrats and a Quarter; and one other rough Stone
weighing about 21 Carrats, a Point some thing fallen, Chris-
talline, White and Clean.' 1 One is glad to read in 'Luttrel's
Diary,' January 15, 1709, ' Part of the Diamonds missing out
of the Ship Albemarle are found, and brought to the Secretary's
Office.'
   'Lost April 23 (1702) upon the day of Her Majesty's
Coronation, in or near Westminster Hall, a Diamond
Stomacher, with a Row of Rose Diamonds down the Middle,
with knots of small Rose Diamonds on each side; in the set-
ting there being a joint between each knot; they being all
set in Silver, and sow'd upon black Ribbon. Lost also at the
same time one large Rose Diamond set in Silver, and fastened
to a Bodkin.'
   The Queen herself lost some diamonds on this memorable
occasion, but nothing of great value, as only ten guineas were
offered as a reward. 'Whereas there was Ten Small Diamonds
singly set in Silver, but made up together into a Sprig
fastened by a Wire, which were lost from her Majesty's Robes
in the Procession upon the Coronation Day,' etc. This, how-
ever, was not the only loss the Queen suffered during her reign,
some of her subjects conceiving a violent affection for her
plate-vide the following advertisements. 'Whereas several
pieces of Plate, as Dishes, Trencher Plates, Knives, forks,

Linen and other Necessaries, which were provided and used
in Westminster Hall at her Majesty's Coronation Feast on
23 Inst., have been taken away from thence, and are yet
concealed,'1  etc.   'Lost last night, being the 10th of this
Instant, January, the following Pieces of Plate, viz, a large
Monteith 2 with the Queen's Arms; a Salver, with the Royal
Arms; 3 Salts Nurl'd; 4 Spoons, with W. R. in a Cypher,

at Windsor, on Sunday the 4th Instant, Two Silver Trencher
Plates of Her Majesty's Engraven'd A. R. and the Arms of
England before the Union.'
    The plate of this reign was heavy and cumbrous, and of
very little artistic merit. It was greatly in use, and was an
outward and visible sign of its owner's wealth. To such an
extent did its use obtain, that taverns were ordered not to
have silver tankards, the temptation to steal them being so
great.
    Ladies occasionally wore chatelaines in the street, and lost
them, whilst they seem only to have worn their watches for
the sake of losing their outer case, judging by the numbers
of advertisements. Being worn outside, there was nothing
easier to steal.  Not the whole watch; oh no! but gently to
press the spring, and the gold case was in the thief's posses-
sion, with next door to no risk. They were absolutely asking

brim, the object of which was to convert it into a convenient tray for bringing in
the wine-glasses. These being placed with the brims downwards, radiating from
the centre and with the handles protruding through the indentations in the bowl,
were easily carried without much jingling or risk of breaking. Of course the
bowl would then be empty of liquor!

IN the matter of food, people were not gourmets as a rule.
The living was plentiful, but plain, and a dinner was never
more than two courses; as Addison wrote, 'two plain dishes,
with two or three good natured, chearful, ingenious friends,
would make me more pleased and vain than all that pomp
and luxury can bestow;' and this sentiment pervaded the
whole of society. Dinner is almost the only meal ever men-
tioned, and one looks in vain for details of breakfast or supper.
They were taken, of course, but men, then, did not sufficiently
deify their stomachs, as to be always talking about them:
dinner was the meal of the day, and there is no doubt that
the most was made of that opportunity. Misson says: 'The
English eat a great deal at dinner; they rest a while, and to it
again, till they have quite stuff'd their Paunch. Their Supper
is moderate: Gluttons at Noon, and abstinent at Night. I
always heard they were great Flesh eaters, and I found it
true. I have known several people in England that never
eat any Bread, and universally they eat very little: they
nibble a few crumbs, while they chew the Meat by whole
Mouthfuls. Generally speaking, the English Tables are not
delicately serv'd. There are some Noblemen that have both
French and English Cooks, and these eat much after the
French manner; but among the middling Sort of People they
have ten or twelve Sorts of common Meats, which infallibly

take their Turns at their Tables, and two Dishes are their
Dinners: a Pudding, for instance, and a Piece of Roast Beef;
another time they will have a piece of Boil'd Beef, and then
they salt it some Days before hand, and besiege it with five
or six Heaps of Cabbage, Carrots, Turnips, or some other
Herbs or Roots, well pepper'd and salted, and swimming in
putter: A Leg of roast or boil'd Mutton, dish'd up with the
same dainties, Fowls, Pigs, Ox Tripes, and Tongues, Rabbits,
Pidgeons, all well moistened with Butter, without larding:
Two of these Dishes, always serv'd up one after the other,
make the usual Dinner of a Substantial Gentleman, or wealthy
Citizen. When they have boil'd Meat, there is sometimes
one of the Company that will have the Broth; this is a kind
of Soup, with a little Oatmeal in it, and some Leaves of
Thyme or Sage, or other such small Herbs. They bring up
this in as many Porringers as there are People that desire
it; those that please, crumble a little Bread into it, and
this makes a kind of Potage.'
   Here, then, we have a very graphic, and evidently un-
biassed, account of the cuisine of this reign. Two o'clock
seems to have been the middle-class time of dining, but
people with any pretension to fashion dined later. 'Why,
does any Body Dine before Four a Clock in London ? For
my Part, I think it an ill bred Custom to make my Appetite
Pendulum to the Twelfth Hour.' Besides, 'tis out of Fashion
to Dine by Day light.' 1 And Steele, writing about 'Rakes,'
says: 'All the noise towards six in the evening is caused by
his mimics and imitators; 2 thus leading to the inference
that, dinner being at four, and wine being plentifully drunk
after it, they rose from table half drunk, and went noisily to
the coffee-houses.
   This, probably, was the case at such a place as Pontack's,
which held the first rank among the restaurants of the time.
It was situated in Abchurch Lane, and was said to have
derived its name from Pontack, a president of the Parliament
of Bordeaux, who gave his name to the best French clarets;
but this could hardly be the case, as all contemporary writers
call the proprietor Pontack. Misson speaks in high terms of
         1 The Basset Table.      2 Tatler, No. 27.

the place. Swift writes to Stella: 'I was this day in the
City, and dined at Pontack's with Stratford, and two other
merchants. Pontack told us, although his wine was so good,
he sold it cheaper than others, he took but seven shillings a
flask;' and again, 'I dined in the City at Pontack's with
Stratford; it Cost me Seven Shillings.' ' Would you think
that little lap dog in Scarlet there, has Stomach enough to
digest a Guinea's worth of Entertainment at Pontack's every
Dinner Time ?' 1 'Mr. Montgomery said you had better go to
Pontack's, Gentlemen, I think there is none here but knows
Pontack's, it is one of the greatest Ordinaries in England.' 2
'Your great Supper lies on my Stomach still, I defie Pontack
to have prepar'd a better o' th' sudden.' 3
   There were others nearly as good.

         At Locket's,4 Brown's and at Pontack's enquire,
         What modish Kick shaws the nice Beaus desire,
         What famed Ragoust, what new invented Salate
         Has best pretentions to regale the Palate.5

Ward describes a tavern ordinary well; he is in his element;
but to give his description would take up too much room.
On entering the bar, the principal person visible was the
dame de comptoir, ' all Ribbons, Lace and Feathers.' Having
passed her, and taken a seat at the table, he had 'a Whet of
Old Hock' to sharpen his appetite for dinner, which consisted
of two calves' heads, a couple of geese, and Cheshire cheese;
after which they all fell to a-drinking wine.
   There were cheaper places, or ordinaries, than these to
dine at. 'I went afterwards to Robin's, 6 and saw People who
had dined with me at the Five penny Ordinary just before,
give Bills for the Value of large Estates;' 7 and twopenny
ordinaries are mentioned, but they must have been for the
very poor.
   In spite of what Misson says, there was good cookery to
be got, only it hardly came into ordinary life; and there are

two cookery books which give most excellent receipts, and
show that there was plenty of variety, both in the material
and cooking of food; nay, even in the elegances of the
table, which were well cared for, as the following receipt of
Howard's shows: ' How to dish up a Dish of Fruits with
preserved Flowers.-Take a large Dish, cover it with another
of the same bigness, and place the uppermost over with
Paste of Almonds, inlaid with red, white, blue, and green
Marmalade in the figure of Flowers and Banks; then take
the branches of candied Flowers, and fix them upright in
Order, and upon little Bushes erected, and covered with
Paste: Fix your preserved and Candied Cherries, Plumbs,
Pease, Apples, Goosberries, Currans, and the like, each in
their proper place; and for Leaves, you may use Coloured
Paste or Wax, Parchment, or Horn; and this, especially in
Winter, will be very proper.' Some of the dishes he gives
are hardly in vogue now; as for instance: ' Spinage Tarts.-
Take Marrow, Spinage, hard Eggs, of each a handful, Cloves,
Mace, Nutmeg, Limon-peel shred very fine; then put in as
many Currans as you think fit, with Raisins stoned, and
shred, candied, Orange and Citron peel; sweeten it to your
taste, make Puff Paste, and make them into little square
Pasties; bake or fry them.'
   Perhaps few people now would care to make Mr. Lamb's
'Patty of Calves' Brains.-The Calves Brains being clean,
scald them, then blanch some Asparagus, and put it in a
Sauce pan, with a little Butter and Parsley; being Cold, put
the Brains in the Patty, with the Asparagus, five or six Yolks
of hard Eggs, and Forc'd Meat; season it with Pepper and
Salt. When it is bak'd, add the Juce of a Lemon, drawn
Butter and Gravy. So serve it.'
    Listen to Misson's ecstasies over our national dish-the
PUDDING. 'The Pudding is a Dish very difficult to be
describ'd, because of the several Sorts there are of it; Flower,
Milk, Eggs, Butter, Sugar, Suet, Marrow, Raisins, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
are the most common Ingredients of a Pudding. They bake

them in an Oven, they boil them with Meat, they make them
fifty several Ways: BLESSED BE HE THAT INVENTED PUD-
DING, for it is a Manna that hits the Palates of all Sorts of
People; a Manna better than that of the Wilderness, because
the People are never weary of it. Ah, what an excellent
Thing is an English Pudding ! To come in Pudding time, is
as much as to say, to come in the most lucky Moment in the
World.'
    Of fish he says: 'In Proportion Fish is dearer than any
other Belly-timber at London ;' and as a matter of fact we
hear very little about it as an article
of food. The country, inland, was of
course entirely dependent upon fresh-
water fish, such as carp, jack, perch,
etc. The London market was at
Billingsgate (which kept up its repu-
tation for its peculiar vernacular), but
that was also waterman's stairs, and a
place of departure for boats; and here
was sold whatever fish was brought to
London. A little before every Lent
came vessels loaded with salt cod,
which were sold at 1s. 6d. to 2s. a
couple, and sometimes at 1d. per lb.
Mackerel, on account of its perishable
nature, was allowed to be sold on
Sunday, as Gay notes, 'Ev'n Sun-
days are prophan'd by Mackrell cries.'
   From Billingsgate the fish was distributed to the various
stalls throughout London:-

           You'll see a draggled Damsel, here and there,
           From Billingsgate her fishy Traffick bear.

 1  There was 'the Royal Peace Pudding, Tickets 1s. each, Made on Thanks-
 giving Day, 1713, 9 feet long, 20 and one half inches broad, and 6 inches deep,' and there were
the famous 12d. Marrow puddings. Blood Puddings were also in vogue. See
Trivia :-
          ' Blood stuffed in Skins is British Christian Food,
          And France robs Marshes of the croaking Brood;
          Spongy Morells in strong Ragousts are found,
          And in the Soupe the slimy Snail is drown'd.'

And these stalls are thus described:

         When fishy Stalls with double Store are laid;
         The golden belly'd Carp, the broad-finn'd Maid,
         Red speckled Trouts, the Salmon's silver Soul,
         The jointed Lobster, and unscaly Soale,
         And luscious 'Scallops, to allure the Tastes
         Of rigid Zealots to delicious Fasts;
         Wednesdays and Fridays you'll observe from hence,
         Days, when our Sires were doom'd to Abstinence.

Care was taken for the preservation of salmon, as the follow-
ing notice shows: ' Whereas by divers ancient statutes made
to prevent the Destruction of the Fry and Brood of Salmons,
it is ordained, That none shall be taken in any of the Rivers
or Waters, wherein Salmon is taken, between the 8th of Sep-
tember and the 11th of November; and that none shall be
taken in the Waters in the County of Lancaster between the
29th of September and the 2d of February; and by a late
Statute, That no Salmons shall be taken in the County of
Southampton and the Southern Parts of Wiltshire between
the 30th of June and the 11th of November, nor be exposed
to Sale under the Penalties thereby provided: These are to
give Notice that all Salmons taken out of their Seasons, and
exposed to Sale in London, will be destroyed, as many lately
have been, by the Rt. Hon. the Lord Mayor of the said City,
as not fit to be sold for Victuals, being taken out of their
Seasons, contrary to the Statutes afore mentioned: And that
every Person bringing before the Lord Mayor such unseason-
able Salmons, shall have a Reward for the same, to be paid
by the Company of Fishmongers, London, as the Lord Mayor
for the time being shall think fit.'1
   Our River Thames, then, was really the habitat of good
fish, for we read: 'A Sturgeon was taken the last Week in
the River near Stepney, which the Lord Mayor sent as a
Present to Her Majesty.' 2
   It causes a sigh of regret to read of the great plenty, and
wonderful cheapness, of real native oysters. They were then,
as now, only considered fit to eat during the months with R

in them; and Gay, speaking of autumn, says, as a sign of
its arrival, 'And Damsels first renew their Oyster Cries';
and in another part of' Trivia' he gives the following sound
advice:-
         If where Fleet Ditch with muddy Current flows,
         You chance to roam; where Oyster Tubs in Rows
         Are rang'd beside the Posts; there stay thy Haste,
         And with the sav'ry Fish indulge thy Taste:
         The Damsel's Knife the gaping Shell commands,
         While the salt Liquor streams between her Hands.

   And they were wonderfully cheap, sold in the streets by
the wheelbarrow men at
'Twelve Pence a Peck.'
There was keen compe-
tition in them, and rival
fishmongers advertised
the superior excellence
of their oysters.  One
will serve as a sample
of the whole. ' Thomas
West Fishmonger in

Cheat, it must be by the Oyster Man, which hath been too
often practised to my Loss and their shameful Gain. My
Oysters Comes in on Monday's, Wednesdays, Thursdays and
Fridays by Water Carriage.  No Trader in the City or
Suburbs having them come in so often, by reason of which,
they will hold good the farthest Journey, to please the nicest
Eater. Those that are not bought at my own Shop, will, by
reason of the Extraordinary Charge be 2d. in a Barrel
advanc'd; and all that are desirous to have them from my
Shop, the same day that they come in of, they shall be
delivered, if desired, as far as St. James for 2d. Temple Bar
1d. And all other places proportionable, and when all is
said, I hope tryal will be your Satisfaction.'
    Pickled oysters were also imported from Jersey, and sold at
1s. 8d. per hundred. Swift writes Stella 1 how 'Lord Masham
made me go home with him to night to eat boiled oysters.
Take Oysters, wash them clean, that is, wash their shells
clean; then put your oysters in an earthen pot, with their
hollow sides down, then put this pot covered, into a great
Kettle with water, and so let them boil. Your oysters are
boiled in their own liquor, and (do) not mix water.'
   Poultry, with the exception of game, was the same as
now; the only importation from foreign parts, seemingly,
being ortolans, which were brought over in September of
each year. The English ortolan, too, was keenly relished by
epicures.  ' You have a coarse stomach, and to such a one,
a Surloin of Beef were better than a dish of Wheat ears.' 2
   For relishes, there were anchovies 8d. per 1b., neats'
tongues and York hams 6d. per 1b.; but salt was somewhat
dear. The home manufacture did not supply the whole
demand, as now, and it was imported both from Portugal and
France.  Still, it was made at home.  'Whereas it hath
been reported, that there was not a sufficient quantity of Salt
made at Shirley wich, in the county of Stafford, to supply the
customers that came for it. This is to give notice, that with the
Additional Works, there is now twice the quantity made out
of the new Pit, much better and stronger than was formerly.' 3

   And so they continued to regulate the price, according to
the fluctuations of the corn market.
   Milk was produced from cows kept in London, and was
carried round by women, or milkmaids, as they were called.
         On Doors the sallow Milkmaid chalks her Gains;
         Ah ! how unlike the Milkmaid of the Plains !
And the milch-asses went their daily rounds. Asses' milk
was in great request, and many were the advertisements of
milch-asses for sale. Its price was 3s. 6d. per quart.

Butter was got from the surrounding villages, but already
there was a trade in this article with Ireland, for on August
14, 1705, was sold at the Marine Coffee House thirty-eight
casks of Irish butter and forty-nine casks of Irish beef.
   There were several markets in London, each with its
specialty.

       Such Newgate's copious Market best affords;

   Vegetables were principally supplied from the Lambeth
market gardens, which are thus mentioned by Steele 1:
'When we first put off from Shore, we soon fell in with a
Fleet of Gardeners bound for the several Market Ports of
London; and it was the most pleasing Scene imaginable to
see the Chearfulness with which those industrious People
ply'd their Way to a certain Sale of their Goods. The Banks
on each Side are as well peopled, and beautified with as
agreeable Plantations, as any Spot on the Earth; but the
Thames itself, loaded with the Product of each Shore, added
very much to the Landskip. It was very easie to observe by
their Sailing, and the Countenances of the ruddy Virgins who
                       1 Spectator, No. 454.

 were Supercargoes, the Parts of the Town to which they were
 bound. There was an air in the Purveyors for Covent Garden,
 who frequently converse with Morning Rakes, very unlike
 the seemly Sobriety of those bound for Stocks Market.'
    Neither Ward nor Brown viewed the Lambeth gardeners
 in such a couleur-de-rose aspect; and haply they described
 the scene more accurately. The former says: 'A scoundrel
 crew of Lambeth Gardeners attacked us with such a Volley of
 saucy Nonsence, that it made my Eyes stare, my Head ake,
 my Tongue run, and my Ears tingle.' Brown tells us that
 ' the next diverting Scene that the River afforded us, was a
 very warm Engagement between a Western Barge, and a
 Boat full of Lambeth Gardeners, by whom Billingsgate was
 much outdone in stupendious Obscenity, tonitrous Verbosity,
 and malicious Scurrility, as if one side had been Daniel
 D-f-'s l Party, and the other the Observator's.' And they
 both give examples of this bargee slang, which, it is needless
 to say, are utterly unfit for reproduction.
    From these market gardens came the 'Asparagrass' and
'Sallary,'2 the 'Apricocks' and those melons which the
Spectator noted were consigned by Mr. Cuffe of Nine Elms
to Sarah Sewell and Company, at their stall in Covent
Garden.
    Misson says, 'Fruit is brought only to the Tables of the
Great, and of a small number even among them. The Desert
they never dream of, unless it be a Piece of Cheese.' That
possibly was correct, but still a great deal of fruit was eaten.
The Daily Courant of Feb. 20, 1714, mentions the following
-Pears: 'Bon chrestien,' 'Mesir jean,' 'Beure.' Apples:
'Pomme Royal,' ' Pomme Dapy,' ' Reinette Grise,' and the
' Magdelaine' peach. We also see that
         Wallnuts the Fruit'rer's Hand, in Autumn stain,
         Blue Plumbs, and juicy Pears augment his Gain;

'Lisbon, China Oranges, and Sower Oranges' were sold in
Love Lane, near Billingsgate; as were also 'a Parcel of Pot

China Oranges, of a pleasant taste and flavour, landed out of
the Lisbon Fleet, now a delivering.' Oranges were favourite
trees to grow here, and one advertisement mentions 7,000
of them for sale. The retail price of oranges was not ex-
cessive, considering the restricted commerce, and the small
tonnage of the shipping. 'We have the finest oranges for
two pence a piece,' writes Swift.
   The foreign fruit market was, as now, near Billingsgate,
and here were sold olives, raisins, currants, French ' Pruants,'
and the choicer sorts of French dry fruits, 'Pears of Rousselet,
of Champagne, Prunes of Tours, and Muscadine Grapes,'
'Candid Maderas Citrons, and Sweet Barbary Almonds.'

BEER always has been the alcoholic liquor most largely
consumed in England, and, among the poorer and lower
middle classes, it was so in Anne's reign; but it was looked
down upon, and despised, by the upper classes. It 'was of
different qualities, from the 'penny Nipperkin of Molassas
Ale' 1 to 'a pint of Ale cost me fivepence.'2  Not only were
there the local brewers in London, but the excellence of
' right Darby' and 'Sleeford or Lincolnshire' ales was such
that these breweries were represented. ' Right North Country
Pale Ale ready bottled at 4s. per dozen' was also to be
had; and pale ale was exported. 'Any Merchant that has
occasion for Pale Ale and Stout, to send to the West Indies,
may at any time be supplied at the Fountain Brewhouse, by
the Hermitage, with Beer for Shipping at reasonable rates.'
Dantzic Spruce was also imported. Beer was taxed then, as
now, by the barrel. 'Yesterday the Commons, in a Com-
mittee of Ways and Means, resolved, That an additional duty
of 3d. per barrel be laid upon all beer and ale above 6s. per
barrel; and under 6s., 1d.; vinegar 9d.; cyder per hogshead
5d.; strong waters mead and matheglin 1d. per gallon.'3
   But, for well-to-do people, wine was the drink, and the
variety was nearly as great as in our time. It was a hard-
drinking age, and the habit was universal. 'I look'd to have

found you with your Head ake and your morning Qualms'1
must have been a not unusual salutation; but it was not
done for the same reason as by those gentlemen mentioned
in the Guardian (No. 58), 'who drink vast quantities of ale
and October to encourage our manufactures; and another
who takes his three bottles of French claret every night
because it brings a great custom to the Crown.'

These evening potations rendered a morning's draught
generally necessary; but, after that, drinking was again
postponed till the day's work was over. The modern system
of 'nipping' did obtain to a slight degree, but it was repre-
hended. 'Whereas Mr. Bickerstaff, by a letter bearing date
this twenty fourth of February, has received information that
there are in and about the Royal Exchange a sort of people
commonly known by the name of WHETTERS, who drink
themselves into an intermediate state of being neither drunk
nor sober before the hours of Exchange, or business; and in
that condition buy and sell stocks, discount notes, and do
many other acts of well disposed citizens; this is to give
notice, that from this day forward no WHETTER shall be
able to give or endorse any note, or execute any other point
of Commerce, after the third half pint, before the hour of
one; and whoever shall transact any matter or matters with a
WHETTER, not being himself of that order, shall be conducted
to Moorfields 2 upon the first application of his next of kin.' 3
   The war with France made the French wines somewhat
scarcer than they would otherwise have been, and opened a
trade for wines from other countries; still the number of
prizes taken, laden with clarets, etc., and the efforts of smug-
glers, kept the market pretty well supplied. The wines seem
to have been good, although the Spanish and Portuguese
wines were fortified with ' Stum,' a fact well known, especially

as to its effects: 'get drunk with Stum'd wine.'1 The French
wines were very numerous-some even unknown to us by
their names-comprising Champagne, Burgundy, Frontiniac,
Muscat, Anjou, Bouvrie (? Vouvray), Bayonne, Obrian (Haut-
brion), Pontack, Claret, Bomas (? Pomard), High Priniac
(Preignac), La Fitt, Margouze (Margeaux), La Tour, Graves,
Cahorze, Blacart, Monson, Hermitage, Langoon, Bosmes
(? Beaumes), Macco (? Macon), Languedoc, and Cap Breton
clarets. Their prices were various: ordinary clarets from
the wood 4s. to 6s. per gallon; good bottled clarets from
3s. or 4s. to 10s. a bottle. Champagne came over in baskets
or hampers containing ten dozen to two hundred bottles per
basket, and was sold retail about 8s. a bottle. Good Bur-
gundy cost 7s. a bottle, but these prices varied, as they do
now, with the quality.
   French wines, however, were not universal favourites. 'A
Bottle or two of good solid Edifying Port, at honest George's,
made a Night chearful, and threw off Reserve. But this plaguy
French Claret will not only Cost us more Money, but do us less
Good,' growls Steele. 2  Being at war with France, it was con-
sidered patriotic not to drink French wine, and Port became
popular. Its introduction was owing to the treaty with Por-
tugal in 1703, called the Methuen Treaty, from the name of
our minister at Lisbon. It is famed as being the shortest
treaty known, consisting of only two clauses, one that the
Portuguese should take British cloths, and the other that
Portuguese wines should be admitted here at one third less
duty than the French wines paid. Red Viana seems to have
been frequently substituted for port, and it was sold at about
5s. a gallon. Then there were White Viana, Lisbon, Passada,
Annadea, Bende Carlo (Beni Carlos), Barrabar, Carcavella,
and Ribidavia, whilst the Spanish wines were Sherry, Malaga,
Tent, Saragusa, Villa Nova, Barcelona, Alicant, Re Gallicia,
Sallo or Mattero, and White Muscadine. There were Florence
wines, which came over in rush-covered flasks with oil in the
neck of the flasks-Chiante, Multapulchana (? Montepulciano),
Madeira, Canary, Tockay from Hungary, and also (verily,
there is very little new under the sun) Carlowitz, from the
     1 Shadwell's Epsom Wells.      2 Spectator, No. 43.

same country; there were wines from Neuchatel, and a wine
I cannot class, called Mount Allaguer. We hear very little
of Rhenish wines. In 'Tunbridge Walks' an uncomplimen-
tary reference is made, 'Dam rotgut Rhenish'; but fine old
hock was selling in I713 at 26s. a dozen, including bottles,
or new Rhenish might be had for 1s. 8d. a quart, or 6s. a
gallon. It is hardly worth going into the prices of these
miscellaneous wines. One advertisement will be sufficient.
'Advertisement to Private Families of 33 Dozen Bottles
of excellent rich Palm Canary Wine, a Flower; also 45
Dozen of Curious Red Zant, a most noble and scarce Wine,
no Champaign or Burgundy drinks finer, and likewise 60
Dozen of Choice Florence Wine, true Flavour and Colour, all
perfect Neat, and as good as ever was tasted, reserv'd by a
Gentleman for his own drinking, but oblig'd to sell them:
The Palm Wine at 30s. a Dozen, the Zant and Florence
each 36s. Bottles and all (none less than 4 Bottles) which is
but at the rate of 2s. 3d. a Quart for the Palm Wine, and
2s. 9d. for the Zant and Florence, tho' would fetch more if
the Owner could Keep them, the like being scarcely to be
had in Town, at leastwise not under 3s. a Quart the first, and
3s. 6d. the last, if for that, and will be dearer.'
   Retailers had to take out a licence to sell wine; and of
course there were customs duties. Luttrell says, Dec. 4, I703:
' Yesterday the Commons, in a Committee upon the Supply,
resolved, nemine contradicente, that 1s. per gallon be laid
upon all Wines over and above the present Customs, to be
paid by the retailer ;' but, afterwards, he writes, Jan. 15, 1704,
that the Commons rejected the bill for 1s. per gallon upon
wines.  On March 20, 1706, the Queen gave her royal
assent to an Act 'for a further duty on low Wines'; and, in
1713, French wines paid a duty of 4s. 6d. per gallon !
   The wine merchants of the time were an enterprising firm
named Brooke & Hellier (mentioned in the Spectator more
than once), who had several branch establishments in various
parts of London, even brought wine by road from Bristol,
and one year paid as much as 25,000&pound;. customs duties; but
they came to grief in 1712, and dissolved partnership.
Brooke afterwards set up in business by himself.

   There was Batavian arrack for those that liked it, usque-
baugh (both green and golden), and brandy-especially
Nants brandy-beloved of the poor in penny drams. Not
but what there were other brandies-Gaudarella, Viana or Fial
(? Fayal), Strasburg, Spanish, and even our familiar old friend
British brandy.  The average retail price of 'right Nants'
seems to have been about 12s. per gallon, but Spanish could
be got 2s. 6d. per gallon cheaper. In 1713 the customs duty
on brandy was 6s. 8d. per gallon; freight and leakage came
to 2s. 6d.; so that it did not leave much profit after paying
for the brandy.
   There were liqueurs and cordials; and they must have
been very diversified, for the name of the 'Still room' was
not then an empty sound; and scandal just whispered that
it was sometimes possible that the dear creatures tasted their
own manufactures. Are we to believe the following sketch ?
' It would make a Man smile to behold her Figure in a front
Box, where her twinkling Eyes, by her Afternoon's Drams of
Ratifee and cold Tea, sparkle more than her Pendants...
Her Closet is always as well stor'd with Juleps, Restoratives,
and Strong Waters, as an Apothecary's Shop, or a Distiller's
Laboratory; and is herself so notable a Housewife in the
Art of preparing them that she has a larger Collection of
Chemical Receipts than a Dutch Mountebank . . . As soon
as she rises, she must have a Salutary Dram to keep her
Stomach from the Cholick; a Whet before she eats, to
procure Appetite; after eating, a plentiful Dose for Con-
coction; and to be sure a Bottle of Brandy under her Bed
side for fear of fainting in the Night.''
   These cordials were not always palatable, if we can
believe Addison's description of 'Widow Trueby's Water,'
which Sir Roger 'always drank before he went abroad.'
There were the ' Ratafia of Apricocks,' the ' Fenouillette of
Rhe,' 'Millefleurs,' 'Orangiat,' 'Burgamot,' 'Pesicot,' and
citron or cithern water, with many others. Elder and other
home-made wines were in use. Let us see how they were
appreciated.  'Her female Ancestors have always been
fam'd for good Housewifry, one of whom is made immortal,

by giving her Name to an Eye Water and two sorts of
Puddings.  I cannot undertake to recite all her Medicinal
Preparations; as Salves, Sere cloths, Powders, Confects, Cor-
dials, Ratifia, Persico, Orange Flower, and Cherry Brandy,
together with innumerable sorts of Simple Waters. But
there is nothing I lay so much to Heart, as that detestable
Catalogue of Counterfeit Wines, which derive their Names
from the Fruits, Herbs or trees of whose Juices they are
chiefly compounded: They are loathsome to the taste and
pernicious to the health; and as they seldom survive the Year,
and then are thrown away, under a false Pretence of Frugality,
I may affirm they stand me in more than if I entertain'd all
our Visiters with the best Burgundy and Champaign.'
   Punch had begun to make its appearance, but it was a
simple liquor to what afterwards became known by that
name. Here is a receipt given by a noted brandy merchant
of the time: 'Major Bird's Receipt to make Punch of his
Brandy. Take 1 Quart of his Brandy, and it will bear 2
Quarts and a Pint of Spring Water; if you drink it very
strong, then 2 Quarts of Water to a Quart of Brandy, with 6
or 8 Lisbon Lemmons, and half a Pound of fine Loaf Sugar:
Then you will find it to have a curious fine scent and flavour,
and Drink and Taste as clean as Burgundy Wine.'
   There was also an intoxicating liquor, still in limited use,
called 'Brunswick Mum,' whose price was '9s. the dozen
without doors, and 10s. within.' The name of this compound
is supposed to be derived from its power of making men
speechlessly drunk.
         The clamorous crowd is hush'd with mugs of mum,
         Till all, turn'd equal, send a general hum.
Bottled cyder, too, could be obtained at 6s. per dozen.
   The antidote to all these intoxicants was to be found
in 'The Essence of Prunes, Chymically prepar'd by a Son
of Monsieur Rochefort, a Sworn Chymist of France.  It
gives English Spirits the smell and taste of Nantz Brandy;
it prevents any Liquor from intoxicating the Brain.'
   We must not forget, however, that tea, coffee, and choco-
late were in much demand, and that both the coffee and
                        1 Spectator, 328.

chocolate houses really supplied these beverages as their
staple article. Tea was more of a home drink, and was very
dear, reckoning the different values of money. Perhaps there
were greater fluctuations in its price than in any other article
of food. Black tea varied in 1704 from 12S. to 16s. per 1b.;
in 1706, 14s. to 16s.; in 1707, which seems to have been an
exceptionally dear year, 16s., 20s., 22s., 24s., 30s., and 32s.;
in 1709, it was from  I4s. to 28s.; and in 1711, 12s. to 28s.
Green tea in 1705 was 13s. 6d. ; in 1707, 20s., 22s., 26s.; in
1709, 10s. to 15s.; and in 1710, 10s. to 16s. The difference
between old and new is given once.  The new tea is 14s.,
and the old 12s. and 10s.
   The margins in price are not only accounted for by the
difference in age, but it was well known that old leaves were
redried, and used in the cheaper sorts; indeed, there is a very
curious advertisement in the advertising portion of the Tatler,
Aug. 26, 1710: 'Bohea Tea, made of the same Materials that
Foreign Bohea is made of, 16s. a Pound. Sold by R. Fary
only, at the Bell in Grace Church Street, Druggist. Note.
The Natural Pecko Tea will remain, after Infusion, of a light
grey Colour. All other Bohea Tea, tho' there be White in it,
will Change Colour, and is artificial.'
   Luttrell writes, Dec. 16, 1704: 'The Commons in a Com-
mittee of wayes and means, resolved to double the duties on
Coffee, Tea, and Chocolate.'
   The first noteworthy incident in the price of coffee in this
reign is an advertisement. 1 'Whereas Coffee was formerly
sold at 2s. 6d. per pound, and is now already amounted to
betwixt 6s. and 7s. per pound, the Majority of the Retailers
have thought it reasonable to request their Customers to pay
3 half pence per Dish, and do assure that no person that
sells Coffee for 1d. a Dish can make good Coffee.' It is rather
interesting to watch the fluctuations in price. In 1706, from
6s. to 6s. 8d. per 1b.; in 1707, from 7s. it fell to 5s. 10d. and
5s. 4d.; in 1708 it rose, either owing to speculation, or a
failure in the crop, to 8s. 4d., 10s., and 11s. 6d., which was the
highest price, when it fell to 9s. 10d. and 9s. In 1709 it still
further fell-7s. 4d. and 6s. 8d.; and in 1710 it was 5s. 8d.

   Attention was paid to its manufacture, for we find that
'Thomas Burges, Druggist, removed from Snow hill to the
Blew Anchor in Fleet Street, near Serjeants Inn, sells the
best of Coffee roasted after a new way, having a better
flavour, and is a much sweeter way than the common method
of roasting Coffee.'
   As tea came into favour, chocolate-drinking fell into dis-
use, although it was generally taken as a drink the first thing
in the morning, before taking tea and toast. It was of two
kinds, Caracas or Caraco, and Martineco; and the former was
the most esteemed. It was roasted and ground, and either
sold plain or mixed with sugar. Its usual price was 3s. per lb.
for the one, and 2s. 6d. for the other. Early in 1703, a man
advertised a machine of his invention, for making chocolate
of a far superior quality, at least 1s. per 1b. under the then
prices; and, as his advertisements are somewhat curious,
an example is given: 'To the Nobility and Gentry. Whereas
the Author of the new Invention for making Chocolate, hath
given a general Satisfaction both for its fineness, goodness
and Cheapness, to all those that ever yet drank of the same,
besides the Satisfaction all persons have of its being cleanly
made, upon sight of the Invention, which some Malicious
persons, the better to impose upon the World to vend their
foul broken Nuts does imitate; but for the working part
are as Ignorant as a Natural Bull. But the Author of this
Invention thinks himself oblig'd to declare to the World, after
10 Years improving the same with great charge and labour,
as many honourable persons in London can testifie; and if
any person can make it appear, that they were the first
Inventers of this so great a conveniency, as does no ways
exceed 12 Inches, before himself, the Author will lay it by,
and Act no more, notwithstanding he is now actually peti-
tioning Her Majesty for a Patten, and, till such time as he
shall obtain the same, will continue to make and sell his
Chocolate at these Rates following, viz. All Spanish Nut
with Vanello at 4s. 8d. a pound, plain 4s. 2d. all Marteneco
Nut with Vanello 3s. 8d.-plain 3s. 2d.-both sorts made up
with Sugar answerable. If any Chocolate maker, or others,
can make it appear he reserves above 8d. in selling a pound

for labour and charges in making, a farther remittance shall
be made in the price.' This gentleman subsequently adver-
tised that he sold it at '2d. per Dish liquid-14d. a Quart
without doors. Sundays excepted.'
   The duty on the nuts was sufficiently high to induce
smuggling. 'Last Week 6 Sacks of Cocoa Nuts were seiz'd

ALLUSION has been made to the prevalent use of tobacco,
both in smoking and as snuff; and, perhaps, at no time in
the century was there a larger consumption. The habit of
meeting convivially at the coffee-houses, and taverns, favoured
the practice of smoking among the men. Ward, who disliked
smoking, gives the following account of a famous tobacco
shop in Fleet Street. Speaking of the company assembled,
he says: 'There was no Talking amongst 'em, but Puff was
the Period of every Sentence; and what they said was as
short as possible, for fear of losing the Pleasure of a Whiff,
as How d'ye do?   Puff.  Thank ye.  Puff. Is the Weed
good?   Puff. Excellent.  Puff.  It's fine Weather.  Puff.
G-d be thanked. Puff. What's a clock. Puff, &amp;c. Behind
the Counter stood a Complaisant Spark who I observ'd
show'd as much Breeding in the Sale of a Pennyworth of
Tobacco, and the Change of a Shilling, as a Courteous Foot-
man when he meets his Brother Skip in the Middle of Covent
Garden; and is so very Dexterous in Discharge of his Occu-
pation, that he guesses from a Pound of Tobacco to an Ounce,
to the certainty of one single Corn. And will serve more
Pennyworths of Tobacco in half an Hour, than some Clou-
terly Mundungus Sellers shall be able to do in half Four
and Twenty. He never makes a Man wait the Tenth part
of a Minute for his Change, but will so readily fling you down
all Sums, without Counting, from a Guinea to three Penny-
worth of Farthings, that you would think he had it ready

in his Hand for you before you ask'd him for it. He was
very generous of his Small beer to a good Customer; and
I am bound to say thus much in his behalf, That he will
show a Man more Civility for the taking of a Penny than
many Mechanicks will do for the taking a Pound.'
   'Tobacco is very much used in England.  The very
Women take it in Abundance, particular'y in the Western
Counties,' writes Misson, and Brown also mentions the prac-
tice; but, although Jorevin reports that in Charles the Second's
time, in Worcestershire, it was not only usual for the women
to join the men in smoking, but that the children were sent
to school with pipes in their satchels, and the schoolmaster
called a halt in their studies whilst they all smoked-he
teaching the neophytes-yet Thoresby runs him very hard.
'20 Jan. 1702. Evening with brother &amp;c. at Garraway's'
Coffee House; was surprised to see his sickly child of
three years old fill its pipe of Tobacco and smoke it as
audfarandly as a man of three score; after that, a second
and a third pipe without the least concern, as it is said to
have done above a year ago.'
   The tobacco was twisted into rope and made up in rolls,
more after the fashion of Varinas Knaster than of our other
twisted tobaccos, and it generally had to be cut up before
using. Its price may be learned from the following adver-
tisements. 'Whereas there has been several Persons who
have pretended to sell the true Spanish roll'd Tobacco;
These are therefore to inform the World, that Jeremiah
Stoaks at Garraway's Coffee House in Exchange Ally,
bought the whole Parcel that was brought into England,
as by Prize taken by Her Majesty's Fleet at Vigo, and
that there is not a Nett Portacco in England but what he
has in his Hands; These are therefore to advise all Gentle-
men, that they may be furnish'd with the same tobacco at
8s. per Pound, at the above mentioned Place, and no where
else.'  This class of tobacco was evidently exceedingly
choice, comparing it with the ordinary price. 'Benjamin
Howes, Tobacconist, at the Corner of Shoe Lane in Fleet
Street, London, who hath lived there 30 years and up-
                        At Leeds.

wards; he was Partner with Mr. Montague, did sell his best
old, mild, sweet-scented Virginia Tobacco for 2s. per Pound,
does now, and will continue to sell the same for 20d., either
Large Cut, Small or Long Cut, and Penny Papers for
Taverns or Publick Houses, full half Ounces for 20d. a
Pound (for present Money). He sells right Spanish in the
Roll for 8s. a Pound, and Spanish and Virginia mixt for
3s. a pound, and Encouragement to Country Chapmen.'
   There was a Customs duty on tobacco, of course; and
we find, in 1707, the Irish Parliament increasing this tax,
among many others, in order to vote a supply of 135,000&pound;.
to Her Majesty. 'Dublin, 5 Aug. Resolved, That it is the
Opinion of this Committee that the said Additional Duty
be three pence halfpenny per Pound weight on all Tobacco
which shall be so Imported into this Kingdom, from and after
the said 29th day of September 1707 over and above the
Hereditary Duty of two pence halfpenny per Pound, pay-
able for the same.'
   But it was the singular growth of the practice of taking
snuff that specially marks the reign of Anne, before which
time it was comparatively unknown. Lillie, the perfumer,
previously mentioned, sold snuff, as all his craft did: and
from him we get a very interesting account of its rise. He
says: 'Before the year 1702, when we sent out a fleet of
ships under the command of Sir George Rooke, with land
forces commanded by the Duke of Ormond, in order to
make a descent on Cadiz, snuff taking was very rare, and,
indeed, little known in England; it being chiefly a luxurious
habit among foreigners residing here, and a few of the
English gentry who had travelled abroad. Among these,
the mode of taking the snuff was with pipes of the size of
quills, out of small spring boxes.  These pipes let out a
very small quantity of snuff, upon the back of the hand, and
this was snuffed up the nostrils with the intention of pro-
ducing the sensation of sneezing, which, I need not say,
forms now no part of the design, or rather fashion of snuff
taking.
   'But to return to our expedition by sea. When the fleet
arrived near Cadiz, our land forces were disembarked at a

209



place called Port St. Mary, where, after some fruitless attempts,
it was resolved to re-embark the troops, and set sail for
England. But previous to this, Port St. Mary, and some
adjacent places were plundered. Here, besides some very
rich merchandize, plate, jewels, pictures, and a great quantity
of cochineal, several thousand barrels and casks of fine snuffs
were taken, which had been manufactured in different parts
of Spain. Each of these contained four tin canisters of
snuff of the best growth, and of the finest Spanish manu-
facture.
   'With this plunder on board (which fell chiefly to the
share of the land officers) the fleet was returning to Eng-
land; but, on the way, it was resolved to pay a visit to
Vigo, a considerable port in Spain, where the Admiral had
advice that a number of galleons from the Havannah, richly
laden, had put in. Here our fleet got in and destroyed
most, or all of the Spanish shipping, and the plunder was
exceedingly rich and valuable.
   'It now came to the turn of the sea officers and sailors
to be snuff proprietors and merchants; for, at Vigo, they
became possessed of prodigious quantities of gross snuff,
from the Havannah, in bales, bags, and scrows, l which were
designed for manufacture in different parts of Spain. Thus,
though snuff taking was very little known or practised in
England, at that period, the quantities taken in this expe-
dition, (which was estimated at fifty tons weight,) plainly
shew that in the other countries of Europe, snuff was held
in great estimation, and that the taking of it was considered
not at all unfashionable.
   'The fleet having returned to England, and the ships
being ordered to be laid in their several ports, the sea
officers and sailors brought their snuff (which was called,
by way of victorious distinction, Vigo Snuff,) to a very
quick and cheap market; waggon-loads of it being sold at
Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Chatham, for not more than
three or four pence per pound.
   'This sort of bale snuff had never been seen or known in
England before, except through some Spanish Jews, who,
                     1 Raw hide packages.

in the present case, bought up almost the whole quantity at a
considerable advantage.
    'The land officers, who were possessed of the fine snuffs
taken at Port St. Mary, sold some of them in the several
ports at which they landed.  Others of them, however,
understood better the nature of the commodity which had
fallen to their share, and kept it for several years, selling it
off by degrees, for very high prices.
    'From the above mentioned quantity of different snuffs,
thus distributed throughout the kingdom, novelty being
quickly embraced by us in England, arose the custom and
fashion of snuff taking; and, growing upon the whole nation,
by degrees, it is now almost as universal here, as in any other
part of Europe.'
    But snuff was not always sold ready made: people made
their own, out of roll tobacco-by means of rasps, which
were generally carried in the pocket. Specimens of these
rasps may be seen at the South Kensington Museum,
but, unless they are in some loan collection, they are very
poor examples. In private collections, and especially on
the Continent, are some of them, being exquisite specimens
of ivory carving. 'Then there's the Miscellany, an apron
for Stella, a pound of chocolate, without sugar, for Stella, a
fine snuff rasp of ivory, given me by Mrs. St. John for
Dingley, and a large roll of tobacco, which she must hide,
or cut shorter out of modesty, and four pair of spectacles for
the Lord knows who.' 1
   Here we see how customary it was for ladies to take
snuff in 1711, although Steele seems to be shocked at it, as
quite a new fashion in 1712. Vide his letter in Spectator
(344):' I have writ to you three or four times to desire
you would take notice of an impertinent Custom the Women,
the fine Women, have lately fallen into, of taking Snuff.
This silly Trick is attended with such a Coquet Air in
some Ladies, and such a sedate Masculine one in others, that
I can not tell which to most complain of; but they are to
me equally disagreeable. Mrs. Saunter is so impatient of
being without it, that she takes it as often as she does Salt

  at meals; and as she affects a wonderful Ease and Negli-
  gence in all her manners, an upper Lip mixed with Snuff
  and the Sauce is what is presented to the Observation of all
  who have the honour to eat with her. The pretty Creature
  her Niece does all she can to be as disagreeable as her Aunt;
  and, if she is not so offensive to the Eye, she is quite as much
  to the Ear, and makes up all she wants in a confident Air,
  by a nauseous Rattle of the Nose, when the Snuff is de-
  livered, and the Fingers make the Stops and Closes on the
  Nostrils. . . . But Flavilla is so far taken with her Be-
  haviour in this kind, that she pulls out her Box (which is
  indeed full of good Brazile) in the middle of the Sermon ; 1
  and to shew she has the Audacity of a well bred Woman,
  she offers it to the Men, as well as to the Women who sit
  near her .... On Sunday was sennight, when they came
  about for the Offering, she gave her Charity with a very good
  Air, but at the same Time asked the Church warden if he
  would take a Pinch.'
    But, if the ladies took snuff, how much more did the men ?
 who were especially addicted to 'the humour of taking
 SNUFF, and looking dirty about the mouth by way of orna-
 ment.' They took snuff 'with a very Jantee Air,' 2 as is well
 exemplified by Steele's humorous puff in Spectator (138): 'The
 Exercise of the Snuff Box, according to the most fashion-
 able Airs and Motions, in opposition to the Exercise of the
 Fan, will be taught with the best plain or perfumed Snuff
 at Charles Lillie's, Perfumer, at the Corner of Beaufort
 Buildings in the Strand, and Attendance given for the
 Benefit of the young Merchants about the Exchange for two
 hours every day at Noon, except Sundays, at a Toy Shop
 near Garraway's Coffee House.   There will likewise be
 Taught The Ceremony of the Snuff box, or Rules for offering
 Snuff to a Stranger, a Friend, or a Mistress, according to the
 Degrees of Familiarity or Distance; with an Explanation of
 the Careless, the Scornful, the Politick, and the Surly Pinch,
and the Gestures proper to each of them.'
    Snuff was not always taken with the finger and thumb,

but a spoon was used-as it is now, in some parts of Scot-
land, Lapland, Sweden, Norway, and China. In the pro-
logue of a play called ' Hampstead Heath,' published in I706,
this habit is mentioned.

   A more exhaustive list could have been made, but enough
is given to show the difference in price of the various sorts.
These were more than have just been given, and included
Oronoko, Barcelona, Portugal, Tonkar, Orangerie, Port St.
Mary's, Alicant, Rancia, and Cabinet Havannah.
   And there were snuffs which hardly came under the
category of harmless sternutatories: as, 'The true Imperial
Golden Snuff; which thousands of People have found to be
the most effectual Remedy ever known, for all Distempers
of the Head and Brain; It immediately cures the Head-

for all Humours in the Eyes and Dimness of sight, and cer-
tainly prevents Appoplexies and Falling Sickness.'
   Snuff played its part in helping to pay for the long war
with France. l '9 Feb. 1710. Yesterday the House of Com-
mons, in a Committee on Ways and means, resolved, that
. . . a duty of 3s. per pound be laid upon Snuff above what
it already pays, except that of Her Majesty's growth.'

THE coffee-house was not a new institution in Anne's reign,
but then it reached the zenith of its popularity. It was
the centre of news, the lounge of the idler, the rendezvous
for appointments, the mart for business men. Men might
have their letters left there, as did Swift; 1 'Yet Presto2
ben't angry, faith, not a bit, only he will begin to be in pain
next Irish Post, except he sees M. D.'s little handwriting in
the glass frame at the bar of St. James's Coffee House, where
Presto would never go but for that purpose.' They were alike
the haunt of the wit and the man of fashion-a neutral
meeting-ground for all men, although they naturally assorted
themselves, like to like, by degrees. There

Farquhar suggests, when he makes Aimwell say to Gibbet,4
who is a highwayman, 'Pray Sir, ha'nt I seen your face at
Will's Coffee House?' and he replies, 'Yes Sir, and at
White's too.' But the excellent rules in force, and the good
common sense of the frequenters, prevented any ill effects

playing or dicing allowed, and no wager might be made
exceeding 5s. These were the simple rules generally used,
and, if they were only complied with, all must have felt the
benefit of such a mild despotism.
   Wood mentions that the first coffee-house was at Oxford,
and was kept, in 1650, by Jacobs, a Jew. The first in Lon-
don, seems to have been kept by a foreigner named Rosa
Pasquee, in 1652, in St. Michael's Alley, Cornhill, whilst
Hatton says : 'I find it Recorded that one James Farr,
a Barber, who kept the Coffee House which now is the
Rainbow, by the Inner Temple Gate, (one of the first in
England) was in the year 1657 presented by the Inquest of
St. Dunstans in the W. for Making and Selling a sort of
Liquor, called Coffee, as a great Nusance and Prejudice of
the neighbourhood, &amp;c. And who would then have thought
London would ever have had near 3,000 such Nusances, and
that Coffee should have been (as now) so much Drank by the
best of Quality and Physicians.' Of these 'near 3,000' I
have, in my searches through the newspapers, etc., of the
period, found the names of over 500, which, to preserve them
again from  falling into oblivion, are to be found in the
Appendix to this book.
   These coffee-houses sold alcoholic liquors as well as
coffee; a fact which is somewhat whimsically illustrated
in the following extract from  a letter of Bishop Trelawney
to Bishop Sprat, July 20, 1702 or 3. 2 'I had a particular
obligation to Burnett, and will publicly thank him in print
(among other matters I have to say to him, and to his Articles
against our religion) for his causing it to be spread by his
emissaries that I was drunk at Salisbury the 30th of January;
whereas the Major General,3 Captain Culleford, a very honest
Clergyman, and the people of the Inn (which was a coffee
house too) can swear I drank nothing but two dishes of
Coffee; and, indeed I had not stopped at all, but to enable

  3 His brother. Bishop Trelawney was also a baronet; and he had an
unepiscopal habit of swearing occasionally, but when such afaux pas occurred
he always said it was the baronet, not the bishop, that swore. The inconvenience
of this arrangement was pointed out to him one day by a friend, who remarked
that, if the baronet was damned for swearing, what would become of the bishop ?

my children, by a very slender bait, to hold out to Blandford,
where I dined at 6 that night.'
   Misson, speaking of coffee-houses, says: 'These Houses,
which are very numerous in London, are extreamly con-
venient. You have all Manner of News there: You have a
good Fire, which you may sit by as long as you please; You
have a Dish of Coffee, you meet your Friends for the Trans-
action of Business, and all for a Penny, if you don't Care to
spend more.' Yes, that was all-anybody, decently dressed,
might have all this accommodation for One Penny. 'Laying
down my Penny upon the Bar,' writes Addison, 1 and 'so
briefly deposited my Copper at the Bar,' says Brown, show
that the habitue's spent no more; and Steele, in the first
number of the Tatler, speaking of the expenses attending
the production of the paper, says: 'I once more desire my
readers to consider, that as I cannot keep an ingenious man
to go daily to Will's under two pence each day, merely for
his charges; to White's under sixpence; nor to the Grecian,
without allowing him some plain Spanish (snuff) to be as
able as others at the learned table,' etc.
   A man with leisure got rid of some hours daily at the
coffee house, or houses, and such a one would spend from
1O A.M. till noon, and again, after his two-o'clock dinner,
would be there from 4 to 6, when he would leave for the
theatre, or his turn in the park.
   The illustration gives us an excellent idea of the interior
of a coffee-house, and its domestic economy--the dame de
comptoir, the roaring fire with its perpetual supply of hot
water, and its coffee and tea pots set close by, so as to be
kept warm, and the very plain tables and stools, show the
accommodation that was required, and accepted, by the very
plain-living people of that day.
   A coffee-house is necessarily a piece de resistance with
Ward. He describes it graphically, though somewhat roughly,
and he brings the scene of the interior vividly before our
eyes. 'Come, says my Friend, let us step into this Coffee
House here; as you are a Stranger in the Town, it will afford

you some Diversion. Accordingly in we went, where a parcel
of Muddling Muckworms were as busy as so many Rats in
an old Cheese Loft; some Going, some Coming, some Scri-
bling, some Talking, some Drinking, some Smoaking, others
Jangling; and the whole Room stinking of Tobacco, like a
Dutch Scoot or a Boatswain's Cabbin. The Walls being hung
with Gilt Frames, as a Farriers shop with Horse shooes;
which contain'd abundance of Rarities, viz. Nectar and
Ambrosia, May Dew, Golden Elixirs, Popular Pills, Liquid
Snuff, Beautifying Waters, Dentifrisis, Drops, Lozenges, all
as infallible as the Pope,
            Where every one above the rest
            Deservedly has gain'd the Name of Best

(as the famous Saffold has it).'
   Brown, also, has plenty to say about them, but one short
extract only will be borrowed: '`1Every Coffee House is illu-
minated both without and within doors; without by a fine
glass Lantern, and within by a Woman so light and splendid,
you may see through her without the help of a Perspective.
At the Bar the good Man always places a Charming Phillis
or two, who invite you by their amorous glances into their
smoaky Territories, to the loss of your sight.' These 'pretty
barmaids' are spoken of by Steele 1: 'Upon reading your
late Dissertation concerning Idols, I cannot but complain to
you that there are, in Six or Seven Places of this City, Coffee
houses kept by Persons of that Sisterhood. These Idols sit
and receive all Day long the adoration of the Youth within
such and such Districts,' etc. Another contemporary2 notices
that'A Handsom Bar keeper invites more than the Bush.
She's the Loadstone that attracts Men of Steel, both those
that wear it to some purpose, and those that wear it to none.

Morning, know that my friend Beaver the Haberdasher has
a Levy of more undissembled Friends and Admirers, than
most of the Courtiers or Generals of Great Britain. Every
Man about him has, perhaps, a News Paper in his Hand;
but none can pretend to guess what Step will be taken in
any one Court of Europe, till Mr. Beaver has thrown down
his Pipe, and declares what Measures the Allies must enter
into upon this new Posture of Affairs. Our Coffee House is
near one of the Inns of Court, and Beaver has the Audience
and Admiration of his Neighbours from Six 'till within
a Quarter of Eight, at which time he is interrupted by the
Students of the House; some of whom are ready dress'd for
Westminster, at Eight in a Morning, with Faces as busie as
if they were retained in every Cause there; and others come
in their Night Gowns to saunter away their Time, as if they
never designed to go thither. I do not know that I meet
in any of my Walks, Objects which move both my Spleen
and laughter so effectually, as these young Fellows at the
Grecian, Squire's, Searle's, and all other Coffee Houses ad-
jacent to the Law, who rise early for no other purpose but
to publish their Laziness. One would think these young
Virtuosos take a gay Cap and Slippers, with a Scarf and
Party Coloured Gown, to be Ensigns of Dignity, for the
vain things approach each other with an Air, which shews
they regard one another for their Vestments. . . . When the
Day grows too busie for these Gentlemen to enjoy any longer
the Pleasures of their Deshabille with any manner of Con-
fidence, they give place to Men who have Business or Good
Sense in their Faces, and come to the Coffee house, either to
transact Affairs or enjoy Conversation.'
   News was, of course, one of the prime objects of these
gatherings. 'I love News extreamly, I have read Three
News Letters to day. I go from Coffee House to Coffee
House all day on Purpose,' 1 was literally true of some men.
Not that their little newspapers gave them much-but of
them hereafter. Yet there was a chance of hearing some
news before it got into the papers; and the quidnuncs would
go to the Windsor, where was to be had ' also the Transla-
                        ' The Scowrers.

tion of the Harlem Courant, soon after the Post is come,'
or to Grigsby's, where 'all Foreign News is taken in, and
Translated into English immediately after the arrival of any
Mail,' or to Elford's, where 'is to be seen and read Gratis,
the Journal of the famous Voyage of the Duke and Dutchess
Privateer of Bristol, that took the rich Aquiapulca Ship con-
taining many remarkable Transactions. Also an Account of
a Man living alone 4 Years and 4 Months in the Island of
John Fernando, which they brought with them.' This was,
of course, Alexander Selkirk, who was brought off the
island on February 12, 1709; and this log, or the coffee-
house gossip anent it, probably furnished the inspiration for
'Robinson Crusoe,' which Defoe published in 1772.
   We have seen how the coffee-house keepers tried to
advance their beverages from 1d. to 1 and a half d. because of the rise
in coffee; but the effort was spasmodic, and did not last.
They had a far better cry in 1712, as we find in the Daily
Courant of August 8 in that year. 'These are to give
Notice, That the Coffee Men by reason of the present Taxes
on Coffee, Tea, Paper, Candles, and Stamps on all Newspapers,
find themselves under a necessity of advancing some of their
Liquors to the prices following; viz, Coffee 2d. per dish:
Green Tea 3 halfpence; and all Drams 2d. per Dram: to
commence from this day.' Let us hope when they got this
huge advance they made their tea stronger, and did not give
their customers 'that pall'd Stuff too often found in mean
Coffee Houses.' 1
   No doubt, from the familiar abbreviations, such as Tom's,
Ned's, Will's, John's, etc., some of the coffee-houses were
kept by waiters who had saved a little money-such an one
as' Tom the Tyrant; who, as first Minister of the Coffee
House, takes the Government upon him between the Hours
of Eleven and Twelve at night, and gives his Orders in the
most Arbitrary manner to the Servants below him as to the
Disposition of Liquors, Coal and Cinders;' 2 while Kidney,
the waiter at the St. James's Coffee House, immortalised in
the Tatler as having' the ear of the greatest politicians that
come hither,' could not be spoken with 'without clean linen.'

   The chocolate-houses seem to have been a specialty, and
they were few in number. In the commencement of the
reign, in 1702, chocolate was sold at 12d. the quart, 2d. the
dish. I can only find the names of five chocolate-houses
(describing themselves as such), and but two of them are of
any note, White's and the Cocoa Tree. White's was started
in 1698, and was, in Queen Anne's reign, situated five doors
from the bottom of the west side of St. James's Street,
ascending from St. James's Palace. It had a small garden
attached to it. This house was burnt down in 1723, the
King and Prince of Wales looking on. Hogarth has im-
mortalised this event in Plate 6 of the 'Rake's Progress.'
It was to all intents and purposes a gambling house. When
White died is not known, but Mrs. White had it in March
1712. Afterwards it passed into the hands of Arthur, who
had it when it was burnt down; and he removed next door
to the St. James's Coffee House. It soon ceased to be a
chocolate house, and became a club.   In 1755 it was
removed to No. 38, on the opposite or east side of St.
James's Street. White's Club is supposed to be political;
but, apart from its members being Conservative, it takes
no leading part, contenting itself with being extremely aris-
tocratic.
   The Cocoa Tree Chocolate House stood at the end of
Pall Mall, on the site of what now is 87 St. James's Street.
It was a Tory house; indeed, Defoe says, 'A Whig will no
more go to the Cocoa Tree or Ozinda's, than a Tory will be
seen at the Coffee house of St. James's.' The Cocoa Tree
Club is now held at 64 St. James's Street.
   As the coffee-houses occupied so prominent a part in
the social economy of the time, a very brief notice of
some of the best known will be of interest. Anderton's is
still in Fleet Street, beloved of Freemasons and literary
men. Batson's, in Cornhill, was a famous meeting-place for
physicians. The Bay Tree still stands in St. Swithin's Lane.
Button's, which was opposite Tom's, in Russell Street, Covent
Garden, was a great resort of Addison's; and here contribu-
tions to the Guardian could be received. The lion's head
which served as a letter-box has been immortalised in that

paper. It was in imitation of the famous lion at Venice.
The original is still in existence, but is not always accessible
to the curious. It was removed from Button's when that
coffee-house was taken down, and took refuge in the
Shakespeare's Head Tavern, Covent Garden. For a time it was
placed in the Bedford Coffee House, and was used as a letter






























box for contributions to The Inspector. It returned to the
Shakespeare's Head in 1769, and remained there till 1804.
It was then bought by Charles Richardson, the proprietor
of Richardson's Hotel, and at his death it came into the
possession of his son, who sold it to the Duke of Bedford,
and it is now preserved in Woburn Abbey.

     Child's was in St. Paul's Churchyard, and was famous
  for its learned frequenters. It was not far from the College
  of Physicians, which was then in Warwick Lane, so doctors
  came there, and, chief among them, Dr. Mead. Sir Hans
  Sloane and other members of the Royal Society dropped in,
  and the house was a noted resort of clergymen-so much so,
  that it is mentioned as such in the Spectator (No. 609):
  'For that a young Divine, after his first Degree in the
  University, usually comes hither only to shew himself, and on
  that Occasion is apt to think he is but half equipp'd with a
  Gown and Cassock for his publick Appearance, if he hath
  not the additional Ornament of a Scarf of the first Magni-
  tude to entitle him to the appellation of Doctor from his
  Landlady, and the Boy at Child's.'
     The Camisards was in St. Martin's Lane, and took its
  name from the Camisars, who were French religious fanatics,
  who, being persecuted in their own country, came over here
  in 1707. They claimed the gifts of prophecy, and of working
  miracles. The sect soon died out. Dick's, in Fleet Street,
  still stands, and was so called from its first proprietor,
  Richard Turner, in 1680.
     Garraway's is famous, and derived its name from its
 original proprietor, Thomas Garway, a tobacconist and coffee-
 man, who had it in the middle of the 17th century. He is
 said to have been the first to retail tea. It was always a
 mercantile resort, and here were sold wines, etc., by auction.
 The Grecian, in Devereux Court, Temple, was chiefly visited
 by learned men; it was from this place that Steele, in his
 scheme of the Tatler, said that all accounts of learning
 should appear under the title of Grecian. It was not, how-
 ever, because of this proclivity that it obtained its classical
 name: it was kept by a Greek named Constantine. Apart
 from its being naturally frequented by the lawyers, the
 scientific elite went there, as we gather from Thoresby,
 June 12, 1712: 'Attended the Royal Society, where I found
Dr. Douglas dissecting a dolphin, lately caught in the Thames,
where were present the President, Sir Isaac Newton, both the
Secretaries, the two Professors from Oxford, Dr. Halley and
Keil, with others, whose company we afterwards enjoyed at






224    SOCIAL LIFE in the reign of QUEEN ANNE.

the Grecian Coffee House.' The Guildhall Coffee House still
survives.
   Jonathan's was essentially a stockjobbers' house, and was
in Exchange Alley, as was also Baker's, which had a similar
clientele.  'I have been taken for a Merchant upon the
Exchange for above these Ten Years, and sometimes pass for
a Jew in the assembly of Stock Jobbers at Jonathan's,' writes
Addison in the first number of the Spectator. ' Stock Jobbers
busie at Jonathan's from Twelve to Three,' says Ward. The
St. James's was as thoroughly a Whig house as White's was
Tory; and 'Foreign and Domestic News you will have from
St. James's Coffee House' was part of the Tatler programme.
We have seen how Swift used it, and how his letters used to
be directed there; but what he wrote to Stella was hardly the
reason of his frequenting the house. He seems to have got
on very friendly terms with Elliot, the proprietor, rather early
in his London career, for he writes: ' I dined to day with poor
Lord Mountjoy, who is ill of the gout; and this evening I
christened our Coffeeman Elliot's child; where the rogue had
a most noble supper, and Steele and I sat among some scurvy
company over a bowl of punch, so that I am come home late,
young woman, and cannot stay to write to little rogues.' 1
The Jamaica is still in existence, although not where it was
in Anne's reign. It was then in Cornhill, 'by the Ship and
Castle.' The Jerusalem was then, as it used to be not so
long since, 'near Garraway's.'
   Lloyd's was then in Lombard Street, and indeed to this
day, on Lloyd's policies, is stated that this policy shall have
the same effect as if issued in Lombard Street. 'And it is
agreed by us the Insurers, that this Writing or Policy of
Assurance shall be of as much Force and Effect as the surest
Writing or Policy of Assurance heretofore made in Lombard
Street, or in the Royal Exchange, or elsewhere in London.'
Both Steele2 and Addison3 mention this coffee-house; and
for mercantile purposes it shared, with the Marine in Birchin
Lane, the reputation of being the busiest. Here were sales
of wine and ships, and the latter business is still transacted
there.

    A curious custom obtained in this reign-that of selling
 goods, notably wines, by 'the Candle.' Pepys notes it in his
 diary as being new to him, so that it had not been long in
 vogue.  Lloyd's and the Marine Coffee Houses were the
 principal places where these singular auctions were held.
    When the custom died out I cannot learn, but probably
 it was during the first quarter of this century. The latest
 account I can find of its being practised is in The Saturday
 Bristol Times and Mirror of March 29, 1873. 'Sale by
 Candle. The practice of letting by inch of Candle still pre-
 vails in the County of Dorset. At the annual letting of the
-parish meadow of Broadway, near Weymouth, which occurred
a few weeks ago, an inch of candle was placed on a piece of
board nine inches square, and lighted by one of the parish
officers. The biddings were taken down by one of the parish
officers, and the chance of taking the meadow was open to
all while the candle was burning.  The last bidder before
the candle went out was the incoming tenant.  This year
the candle was extinguished suddenly.  The land, about
two acres in extent, was in 1624 presented to the poor by
William Gould, the object of the gift being to keep the poor
from working on the highways.' The custom, for aught I
know, may still exist in some out-of-the-way places.
  Information on maritime matters was even then forwarded
to Lloyd's (although his News was not published after Feb.
23, 1696, till 1726), as is shown by the following episode:
London, August 4th. Yesterday Morning a Letter was sent
by the Penny Post to Mr. Edward Lloyd, Coffee man, in
Lombard Street; which letter was subscrib'd Jo. Browne, was
dated from on Board the Little St. Lewis off Bantry Bay in
Ireland. July. 22. and contain'd in Substance, That the said
Browne coming in a Vessel of which he was Master, from the
Bay of Campeachy for Ireland, was taken by the said little
St. Lewis, a French Frigate of 30 Guns, the 14th of July.'
He then went on circumstantially to relate how an officer on
board had told him that the French had taken the Island of
St. Helena and fifteen English East India ships; and that
the fleet intended to sail for the Cape, to intercept our out-
                    1 Daily Courant, Aug. 4, 1704.

ward-bound East India ships. The editorial comment on
this news is: ''Tis very probable this Letter is a Forgery, but
as we cannot possibly determine whether it be or not, and
the Story having made a great Noise in Town, we found our-
selves oblig'd to give an Account of it.'  It turned out a
hoax, for, next day, Lloyd received a letter saying that the
rumour had served its turn. 'To which Mr. Lloyd thinks fit
to Answer.   Sir, Whoever you are that wrote these two
letters to Mr. Lloyd, he makes it his Request to you, that
you would please to Confirm your Willingness to take off the
Amusement made by the first, by writing him a third Letter
in the same Hand the first was, which the second is not.'
Lloyd died on Feb. 15, 1713.
   There were several coffee-houses kept by persons of the
name of Man. There was Old Man's, Young Man's, Man's
New Coffee House, Charing Cross, Man's in Birchin Lane,
and Man's in Chancery Lane, opposite Lincoln's Inn Gate.
Old Man's was in the Tilt Yard, Whitehall, and was the
rendezvous for officers in the army. The Paymaster-General's
office is now built upon its site. It was kept by the well-
known Jenny Man, whom Brown describes as 'pledging an
Irish Colonel in Usquebaugh.' The Postboy, June 3/5, 1712,
notices her: 'Expect something Extraordinary' in our Next.
In the mean time, we are inform'd, that Jenny - Man is
indispos'd'; and in the Flying Post, Nov. 6/8, 1712, is a
song, one verse of which refers to her :-

           Alas ! alas! for Jenny Man,
           'Cause she don't love the Warming Pan,2
           High Church with all her Actions Scan
             Since she was an Inch long, Sirs;
           She is no Friend to Right Divine,
           Therefore she must not sell French Wine,
           But Tea and Coffee, very fine,
             And sure that is no Wrong, Sirs.

Young Man's was at Charing Cross, and was a fashionable
lounge. It was also a gambling house, for Brown says of it:

Young Man's Coffee House threw it self in my way, and very
kindly offer'd its Protection.  I acquiesced then, knowing
myself secure from more Dangers than one, and immediately
upon my entrance mounted the Stairs, and mingled my
Person with the Knights of the Round Table, who hazard
three Months Revenue at a single Cast.' Ward is disgusted
with the superfine air of the place, and says of its frequenters,
'their whole Exercise being to Charge and Discharge their
Nostrils; and keep the Curles of their Periwigs in proper
Order. . . . They made a Humming, like so many Hornets
in a Country Chimney, not with their talking, but with their
Whispering over their New Minuets and Bories, with their
Hands in their Pockets, if freed from their Snush Box ....
Amongst them were abundance of Officers, or Men who by
their Habit appear'd to be such; but look'd as tenderly, as if
they Carried their Down beds with them into the Camp, and
did not dare to come out of their Tents, in a cold morning,
till they had Eat a Mess of Plum Panada for Breakfast, to
defend their Stomachs from the Wind. . . . Having sat all
this while looking about us, like a Couple of Minerva's Birds,
among so many Juno's Peacocks, admiring their Gaiety; we
began to be thoughtful of a Pipe of Tobacco, which we were
not assur'd we could have the liberty of Smoaking, lest we
should offend those Sweet Breath Gentlemen. But, however,
we Ventur'd to call for some Instruments of Evaporation,
which were accordingly brought us, but with such a Kind of
unwillingness, as if they would much rather have been rid of
our Company; for their Tables were so very Neat, and Shin'd
with Rubbing, like the Upper Leathers of an Alderman's
shoes. The floor as clean Swept, as a Sir Courtly's Dining
Room, which made us look round, to see if there were no
Orders hung up to impose the Forfeiture of so much Mop
Money upon any Person that should spit out of the Chimney
Corner.'
   Nando's was in Fleet Street, at the corner of Inner
Temple Gate, the house wrongly described as being formerly
the palace of Cardinal Wolsey, and now a hairdresser's. It
was not particularly famous for anything in Anne's time, only
the name is familiar to students of that epoch, as being next

door to the shop of Bernard Lintot the bookseller, and men-
tioned by him in all his advertisements.
    Ozinda's was in St. James's Street, and ranked with
White's as a Tory house. Robin's was in Exchange Alley.
Swift dated some of his letters to Stella from this coffee-
house, and Steele mentions it as a Stock Exchange house in
the Spectator, No. 454. The Rainbow in Fleet Street is still
in existence, and Ward  classes it thus: 'Coffee and Water
Gruel to be had at the Rainbow and Nando's at Four.' It
seems to have been a favourite sign, for I have seven on my
list.
   Squire's was in Fulwood's (now called Fuller's) Rents in
Holborn, and has been rendered historical by Addison, who
makes Sir Roger ask him 2 'if I would smoak a Pipe with
him over a Dish of Coffee at Squire's. As I love the old
Man, I take delight in complying with everything that is
agreeable to him, and accordingly waited on him to the
Coffee House, where his venerable Figure drew upon us
the Eyes of the whole Room. He had no sooner seated
himself at the upper End of the high Table, but he called for
a clean Pipe, a Paper of Tobacco, a Dish of Coffee, a Wax
Candle, and the Supplement with such an Air of Cheerfulness
and Goodhumour, that all the Boys in the Coffee room (who
seemed to take pleasure in serving him) were at once em-
ployed on his several Errands, insomuch that no Body else
could come at a Dish of Tea till the knight had got all his
Conveniencies about him.' Squire died in 1717.
   The following note on the Smyrna Coffee House is the
best description possible to give of it.3 'This is to give notice
to all ingenious gentlemen in and about the cities of London
and Westminster, who have a mind to be instructed in the
noble Sciences of Music, Poetry, and Politics, that they repair
to the Smyrna Coffee House in Pall Mall, betwixt the hours
of eight and ten at night, where they may be instructed
gratis, with elaborate ESSAYS by word of mouth on all, or any
of the above mentioned Arts. The disciples are to prepare
their bodies with three dishes of bohea, and purge their brains
with two pinches of snuff.  If any young student gives

   'N.B. The seat of learning is now removed from the corner
of the chimney on the left hand towards the window, to the
round table in the middle of the floor over against the fire;
a revolution much lamented by the porters and chairmen,
who were much edified through a pane of glass that remained
broken all the last summer.'
   John Salter's (or, as he was christened by Steele, or Rear
Admiral Sir John Munden, 'Don Saltero') was situated in
the middle of Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. He was originally a
servant to Sir Hans Sloane, and, when he left his service to
set up as barber and coffee-house keeper, Sir Hans gave him
some odds and ends from his Museum. Other kind friends
followed, and Don Saltero's became a place of note, the
curiosities, natural and otherwise, taking up much of the
space. Indeed, Steele, in recording a visit to the Don's, says, 1
'When I came into the Coffee house, I had not time to salute
the Company, before my eye was diverted by ten thousand
jimcracks round the room and on the ceiling.' The first
catalogue of his curiosities that he published, was in 1729,
and in the preface he says, 'The first Donor was the Honour-
able Sir John Cope, bart., to whom and Family I am much
obliged for several very valuable pieces, both of Nature and
Art.' The list comprises 249 articles, which in the 12th
edition, 1741, was increased to 420, so that, probably, in Anne's
time there were not more than a couple of hundred. Apart
from the natural curiosities, which were numerous, were
many undoubtedly spurious, as '(2) Painted Ribbands from
Jerusalem with the Pillar, to which our Saviour was tied
when scourged, with a Motto on each.' '(40) The Queen of
Sheba's Fan.' He seems to have invested largely in this
royal lady's property, for we have '(53) Queen of Sheba's
Cordial Bottle,' and '(55) The Queen of Sheba's Milk Maid's
Hat.' No. 56 was 'Pontius Pilate's Wife's Chambermaid's

Sister's Sister's Hat'-a relic which, Steele declares, was
made within three miles of Bedford.
   These rather detract from the possible authenticity of the
historical relics, which were numerous, and, if genuine, were
curious and valuable. '(15) A Wooden Shoe put under the
Speaker's Chair in K. James IId's Time.' '(37) Gustavus
Adolphus's Gloves.' '(38) Harry VIIIth's Coat of Mail.'
'(39) Queen Elizabeth's Stirrup.' '(41) Katherine Q. Dow-
ager's Coronation Shoes.' '(42) King Charles IId's Band, which
he wore in Disguise in the Royal Oak.' '(43) William the
Conqueror's Flaming Sword.' '(44) Oliver's Sword.' '(45)King
James IId's Coronation Shoes.' '(46) King William the IIId's
Coronation Sword.' '(47) King William's Coronation Shoes.'
'(49) Queen Anne's Testament.' (50) 'Henry the VIIIth's
Gloves.' '(51) The Czar of Moscow's Gloves ;' and last but
not least-an undeniable forgery, '(242) Robinson Crusoe's
and his Man Friday's Shirts.'
   Steele describes the Don as 'a sage of a thin and meagre
countenance; which aspect made me doubt whether reading
or fretting had made it so philosophic; but I very soon per-
ceived him to be of that sect which the ancients call Gingivistae;
in our language, tooth drawers.' Besides shaving and tooth
drawing, he played on the violin: 'if he would wholly give
himself up to the string, instead of playing twenty beginnings
to tunes, he might, before he dies, play Roger de Caubly 1
quite out. I heard him go through his whole round, and
indeed he does play the " Merry Christ Church Bells "2 pretty
justly;' and another authority says, 'There was no passing
his house, if he was at home, without having one's ears grated
with the sounds of his fiddle, on which he scraped most
execrably.' Steele recommends some of his curiosities to be
taken away, 'or else he may expect to have his letters patent
for making punch superseded, be debarred wearing his Muff
next winter, or ever coming to London without his wife.'
Either of these would have punished Saltero severely, for he

himself. His collection seems to have dwindled away, for
when it was sold in 1799 there were only 121 lots, and the
whole seem to have sold for a little over 50&pound;.
    Slaughter's Coffee House in St. Martin's Lane afterwards
superseded Old Man's as a military meeting-place, and in
the latter half of the century it was frequented by artists
and sculptors. Searl's, or Serle's, was a legal coffee-house,
and was situated at the corner of Lincoln's Inn Fields. Of
Tom's-I have a list of six-perhaps the best known was
that in St. Martin's Lane, where, as we have seen, was one of
the first insurance offices. The Virginia, which was in St.
Michael's Alley, and afterwards in Cornhill, has disappeared
within the last few years.
    'All accounts of POETRY, under Will's Coffee House,'
says the Tatler; it was situated No. I Bow Street, at the
corner of Russell Street, and took its name from its proprietor,
William Urwin. If Ward can be trusted, gamblers as well
as wits frequented it, for he says there was 'great shaking
of the Elbow at Wills about Ten.' Still it was, par excel-
lence, the Wits coffee house, a class who are very happily
described by a contemporary writer: 2 'All their words go
for Jests, and all their Jests for nothing. They are quick in
the Fancy of some ridiculous Thing, and reasonable good in
the Expression. Nothing stops a Jest when it is coming;
and they had rather lose their Friend than their Wit.' And
they are also written of as being 'Conceited, if they had but
once the Honour to dip a finger and thumb in Mr. D--'s 3
snush box, it was enough to inspire 'em with a true Genius of
Poetry, and make 'em write Verse, as fast as a Taylor takes
his stitches.' In fact, it was on Dryden's reputation that
Will's coffee-house was then living; and his going there is
noticed by Pepys, 'Feb. 3, 1664-In Covent Garden to-night,
going to fetch my wife, I stopped at the great Coffee house
there, where I never was before: where Dryden, the poet, I
knew at Cambridge, and all the wits of the town, and Harris
the player, and Mr. Hoole, of our College. And, had I time
then, or could at other times, it will be good coming thither,

for there, I perceive, is very witty and pleasant discourse.
But I could not tarry, and, as it was late, they were all ready
to go away.' Here also Pope saw the old man, whom he
described as 'a plump man with a down look, and not very
conversible.'
   Such, then, were some of the principal coffee-houses.
What were the taverns like ? There were then no hotels
proper, such as we know them: a man had to live in private
apartments, and, when he wanted dinner, he had to betake
himself to a tavern, or ordinary. As Misson remarks, ' At
London they hardly so much as know what an Auberge is:
There are indeed a thousand and a thousand Taverns, where
you may have what you please got for you.' A tavern was a
far more free-and-easy place than a coffee-house-in fact, it
is a question whether the convenances of a coffee-house
would admit of a man 'washing his teeth at a tavern window
in Pall Mall'; 1 indeed, the keeping of them was hardly con-
sidered reputable, for we find 2 that 'Her Majestie sign'd a
warrant for continuing the salaries of the prince's servants
during her life, provided they kept no publick houses.'
   Ward describes 3 the freedom and jollity of these places:
'Accordingly we stept in, and in the Kitchen found half a
dozen of my Friends Associates, in the height of their Jollitry,
as Merry as so many Cantabridgians at Sturbridge Fair, or
Coblers at a Crispins Feast. After a Friendly Salutation, free
from all Foppish Ceremonies, down we sat; and when a
Glass or two round had given fresh Motion to our drowsy
Spirits, and abandon'd all those careful thoughts which
makes Man's Life uneasie, Wit begot Wit, and Wine a Thirsty
Appetite to each Succeeding Glass. Then open were our
Hearts and unconfined our Fancies; my Friend and I con-
tributed our Mites to add to the Treasure of our Felicity.
Songs and Catches Crown'd the Night, and each Man in his
Turn pleased his Ears with his own Harmony.'
   The most singular thing was, that it was not at all dero-
gatory for a nobleman or gentleman to go to a tavern for
a carouse-and all clubs were held at taverns. Thoresby
relates that, after his reception by the Queen, as one of a

Majesty's health, and stayed full late.' And Swift writes to
Stella: l 'After dinner we went to a blind tavern, where
Congreve, Sir Richard Temple, Eastcourt, and Charles Main
were over a bowl of bad punch. The Knight sent for six
flasks of his own wine for me, and we staid till twelve.' This
sending for one's own wine was a peculiar arrangement, but
doubtless the landlord was satisfied with a premium on
'corkage.' Swift frequently speaks of this custom: 'To-
day I dined with Lewis and Prior at an eating house, but
with Lewis's wine.' 'I dined in a Coffee house with Stratford
upon Chops, and some of his Wine.' Again he was with
Lords Harley and Dupplin, the son and son-in-law of the
Earl of Oxford-and 'we were forced to go to a tavern, and
send for wine from Lord Treasurer's.'
   But the frequenters of taverns were not all so respectable
as these examples; and Brown supplies particulars of another
section of society. 'A Tavern is a little Sodom, where as many
Vices are daily practised, as ever were known in the great
one; Thither Libertines repair to drink away their Brains,
Aldermen to talk Treason, and bewail the loss of Trade;
Saints to elevate the Spirit, hatch Calumnies, coin false
News, and reproach the Church; Gamesters to shake their
Elbows; Thither Sober Knaves walk with Drunken Fools to
make Cunning Bargains and overreach them in their Dealings;
Thither Young Quality retire to spend their Tradesmens
Money; Thither Bullies Coach it to Kick Drawers, and
invent new Oaths and Curses; Thither run Sots purely to be
drunk, Beaux to shew their Vanity, Cowards to make them-
selve valiant by the Strength of their Wine, Fools to make
themselves witty in their own Conceits, and Spendthrifts to
be made Miserable by a Ridiculous Consumption of their
own Fortunes.'
   There were lower depths yet: there were the purl houses,
where 'Tradesmen flock in their Morning gowns, by Seven,
to cool their Plucks,' and the mug houses, 2 which in George
    1 Journal, Oct. 27, 1710.
  2 'Here is nothing drunk but Ale, and every Gentleman hath his separate
Mug, which he Chalks on the Table, where he sits, as it is brought in; and every
one retires when he pleases, as from a Coffee House.'-A Journey through Eng-
land, 1722.

the First's time were made into political clubs. 'King George
for Ever' was then the mug-house cry, which the coffee-houses
countered with 'High Church and Ormonde; no Presbyte-
rians; no Hanover; down with the Mug.'
   The following is a list of the principal taverns then in
existence, for some of which I am indebted to Timbs ' Club
Life of London.' 'The Bear,' at the foot of London Bridge,
Southwark and west side, which was in existence in I463,
was not pulled down till 1761.  The 'Boar's Head,' in East-
cheap; Pontack's, in Abchurch Lane; and the ' Pope's Head'
tavern in Pope's Head Alley, were all standing; and the
' Cock,' in Threadneedle Street, was only destroyed in 1851.
There was the 'Salutation' in Newgate Street, where Wren
used to smoke his pipe, whilst St. Paul's was rebuilding.
Dolly's chop-house, in Paternoster Row, was established in
Queen Anne's reign.  The 'White Hart' in Bishopsgate
Without, which bore the date 1480, was not pulled down till
1829. The 'King's Head,' in Fenchurch Street, at the corner
of Mark Lane, was the hostel at which Queen Elizabeth is
said to have dined in May 1554. The 'Devil,' in Fleet
Street, now occupied by Childs' bank, was flourishing, and
Steele describes it 1 as 'a place sacred to mirth tempered with
discretion, where Ben Jonson and his Sons used to make their
liberal meetings,' and he says that in the Apollo room were
the rules of Ben's Club, painted in gold letters over the
chimney piece.
   This tavern was so popular that a rival sprung up on the
other side of the street, the 'Young Devil,' and here, for a
year or so, from the beginning of 1708, till some time in or
about 1709, the Society of Antiquaries held their meetings,
afterwards at the 'Fountain' tavern, Inner Temple Gate.
The 'Cock,' in Fleet Street, has only just been demolished.
There was another famous tavern which was near St. Dun-
stan's Church, in Fleet Street, called 'The Hercules' Pillars,'
which was visited by Pepys, as appears by four entries in his
diary. Another tavern of this name, at Charing Cross, will
be noted when treating of the amusements of the people

236    SOCIAL LIFE in the reign of QUEEN ANNE.

The ' Mitre' tavern must not be confounded with the coffee-
house of that name in Mitre Court, but was the one
frequented by Dr. Johnson, and so often referred to by
Boswell.
   The 'Palsgrave's Head,' on the south side of the Strand,
near Temple Bar, was then a coffee-house, and was so named
from the Palsgrave Frederick, afterwards King of Bohemia,
who married the Princess Elizabeth, daughter of James I.
The 'Crown and Anchor,' which stretched along the Strand
from Arundel Street to Milford Lane, was famous as being
the place where the Academy of Music was instituted in
1710. The 'Rose' tavern in Drury Lane is frequently men-
tioned in the literature of this time. It was afterwards
absorbed into Drury Lane Theatre, when Garrick enlarged
it in 1776. The 'Rummer Tavern,' at Charing Cross, near
Locket's Ordinary, is often mentioned in advertisements, and
Brown and Ward speak of 'Heaven' and ' Hell,' which were
two ale-houses near Westminster Hall. Pepys notices one of
them on January 28, 1660-' And so I returned, and went to
Heaven, where Ludlin and I dined.' And last, not least, was
the 'Bumper' tavern, which 'Dick Estcourt,' the actor, opened
on January I, 1712, and which Steele so kindly puffed in
Spectator No. 264. An exhaustive catalogue of the taverns
in the City is given by Ward in his 'Vade Mecum for
Maltworms,' a very curious and now rare book; but it is
hardly worth while to reproduce their names, even in an
appendix.

Origin-October Club-Calves Head Club-Kit Cat Club-Other clubs-
                      Suggested clubs.
THE name of Club, is undoubtedly taken from the practice
of a jovial company to 'club,' or divide the whole expenses
of the entertainment; and 'the payment of our Clubs' l is a
frequently mentioned wind-up of any festivity. Naturally,
such agreeable meetings were repeated until they became
habitual, and the society, or club, was formed; and these
humble beginnings laid the foundation of that great social
organisation which nowhere flourishes better than in
England.
   The principal clubs of Queen Anne's time were the
October Club, the Calves Head Club, and the Kit Cat Club.
The October Club was a Political Club, of high Tory pro-
clivities, and it was so called from the 'October Ale' which
was supposed to be the drink of the members. It was held
at the 'Bell Tavern,' in King Street, Westminster, and they
succeeded in plaguing the Whigs to their hearts' content.
Swift writes Stella of them :2 'We are plagued here with an
October Club; that is, a set of above a hundred Parliament
men of the Country, who drink October beer at home, and
meet every evening at a tavern near the Parliament, to
consult affairs, and drive things on to extremes against the
Whigs, to call the old ministry to account, and get off five
or six heads. The ministry seem not to regard them, yet
one of them in confidence, told me that there must be some-
thing thought on to settle things better.' Swift wrote a little
pamphlet called 'Some Advice Humbly Offered to the

Members of the October Club, in a letter from a Person of
Honour,' which met with varying fortunes; for he tells Stella,
'The little twopenny letter of "Advice to the October Club,"
does not sell: I know the reason; for it is finely written, I
assure you; and like a true author, I grow fond of it, because
it does not sell: you know that it is usual to writers to
condemn the judgment of the world; if I had hinted it to
be mine, every body would have bought it, but it is a great
secret.'  A few days later, and he writes, February 1, that
it 'begins now to sell; but I believe its fame will hardly
reach Ireland.' There is no doubt but that it partially had
the desired effect-of making these troublesome gentlemen
less obstructive. Poor Swift was once nearly getting into a
dilemma with regard to this club, and his story is as follows:
'Then Ford drew me to dine at a tavern, it happened to be the
day and the house where the October Club dine. After we
had dined, coming down, we called to inquire, whether our
yarn business had been over that day, and I sent into the
room for Sir George Beaumont. But I had like to be drawn
into a difficulty; for in two minutes out comes Mr. Finch,
Lord Guernsey's son, to let me know, that my Lord Compton,
the steward of this feast, desired, in the name of the club,
that I would do them the honour to dine with them. I sent
my excuses, adorned with about thirty compliments, and got
off as fast as I could. It would have been a most improper
thing for me to dine there, considering my friendship for the
Ministry. The Club is about a hundred and fifty, and near
eighty of them were then going to dinner at two long tables
in a great ground room.' 2 Afterwards the October Club was
split, and the more Jacobite portion formed themselves into
the March Club.
   The Calves Head Club was decidedly an opposition one,
and its history, true or not, is told in a little book which
some people have attributed to Ward,3 The SECRET HIS-
TORY of the CALVES HEAD CLUB: or, the REPUBLICAN
UNMASK'D. Wherein is fully shewn the religion of the

   The author tells the history of the club as follows:
'Happening in the late Reign to be in the Company of a cer-
tain active Whigg, who in all other Respects was a Man of
probity enough; he assured me, that to his Knowledge, 'twas
true, That he knew most of the Members of that Club, and
that he had been often invited to their Meetings, but that he
had always avoided them: Adding, that according to the
Principles he was bred up in, he wou'd have made no scruple
to have met Charles the First, in the Field, and oppos'd him
to the utmost of his Power; but that since he was Dead, he
had no further Quarrel to him, and looked upon it as a
cowardly piece of Villany, below any Man of Honour, to
insult upon a Memory of a Prince, who had suffer'd enough
in his Life Time.
   'He farther told me, that Milton, and some other Creatures
of the Commonwealth, had instituted this Club, as he was
inform'd, in Opposition to Bp. Juxon, Dr. Sanderson, Dr.
Hammond, and other Divines of the Church of England, who
met privately every 30th of January; and, tho' it was under
the Time of the Usurpation, had compil'd a private Form of
Service for the Day, not much different from that we now
find in the Liturgy ....
   'By another Gentleman, who, about Eight Years ago,
went out of meer Curiosity to see their Club, and has since
furnish'd me with the following Papers; I was inform'd that
it was kept in no fix'd House, but that they remov'd as they
saw convenient; that the place they met in when he was

with 'em, was a blind Ally, about Morefields; 1 that the
Company wholly consisted of Independents and Anabaptists
(I am glad for the Honour of the Presbyterians to set down
this Remark); that the Famous Jerry White, formerly Chap-
lain to Oliver Cromwell, who, no doubt on 't, came to sanctify
with his Pious Exhortations, the Ribbaldry of the Day, said
Grace; that after the Table Cloth was removed, the Anni-
versary Anthem, as they impiously call'd it, was sung, and
a Calves Scull filled with Wine or other Liquor, and then a
Brimmer went about to the Pious Memory of those worthy
Patriots that had kill'd the Tyrant, and deliver'd their Coun-
try from his Arbitrary Sway; and lastly, a Collection made
for the Mercenary Scribler, to which every Man contributed
according to his Zeal for the Cause, or the Ability of his
Purse.'
    The following 'Anthem,' if not the most refined of the
series, is, at least, the most spirited and characteristic:-

               An Anthem on the 30th of January 1696.
  There was a King of Scottish Race, a Man of Muckle might a,
  Was never seen in Battels Great, but greatly he would sh--a;
  This K. begot another K. which made the Nation sad a,
  Was of the same Religion, an Atheist like his Dad a:
  This Monarch wore a Picked Beard, and seem'd a Doughty Hero,
  As Dioclesian Innocent, and Merciful as Nero.
  The Churches darling Implement, but Scourge of all the People,
  He Swore he'd make each Mother's Son Adore their Idol Steeple:
  But they perceiving his designs, grew plagy shy and jealous,
  And timely Choppt his Calve's head off, and sent him to his fellows.
  Old Rowly did succeed his Dad, such a King was never seen a,
  He'd lye with every nasty Drab, but seldom with his Queen a.

  1 In the ninth ed., 1714, after ' Morefields' it goes on: ' Where an Axe hung
up in the Club Room, and was reverenced as a principal Symbol in this Diabolical
Sacrament. Their Bill of Fare was a large Dish of Calves-Heads, dressed several
ways, by which they represented the King and his Friends, who had suffer'd in
his Cause; a large Pike with a small one in his Mouth, as an Emblem of Tyranny;
a large Cod's Head, by which they pretended to represent the Person of the King
singly; a Boar's Head with an Apple in its Mouth, to represent the King, by
this, as Beastial, as by their other Hieroglyphicks they had done Foolish and
Tyrannical. After the Repast was over, one of their Elders presented an Ikon
Basilike, which was with great Solemnity burn'd upon the Table, whilst the
Anthems were singing. After this, another produc'd Milton's Defensio Populi
Anglicani, upon which all laid their Hands, and made a Protestation in the form
of an Oath, for ever to stand by, and maintain the same;' then the text goes on
as above.

  Whether this 'Secret History' be true or not, it would
almost appear that there was a Calves Head Club in George
the Second's reign, for in the Monthly Intelligencer, which was
a portion of the Gentleman's Magazine, we find 1: 'Friday,
January 30, 1735. Some young Noblemen and Gentlemen
met in a Tavern in Suffolk Street,2 called themselves the
Calves Head Club; dress'd up a Calfs Head in a Napkin,
and after some Huzzas threw it into a Bonfire, and dipt
Napkins in their red Wine, and wav'd them out at Window.
The Mob had strong beer given them, and for a time hallood
as well as the best; but taking Disgust at some Healths
propos'd, grew so outragious, that they broke all the Win-
dows, and forc'd themselves into the House, but the Guards
being sent for, prevented further Mischief.' Different accounts
exist of this occurrence, variously modifying it, until they
end in a total denial; but engravings exist professing to
give the 'True Effigies' of the scene.   Apropos of this,
in the 1714 edition of the 'Secret History' is an engraving
of 'the Westminster Calf's Head Club,' which is none other
than the representation of a coffee-house already produced
(see p. 215), but altered somewhat to suit the occasion. For
instance, the dame de comptoir is erased, and in her place is
a huge axe.
   Perhaps one of the now best-known clubs of Anne's time
was the Kit Cat, which derived its peculiar cognomen (so
Addison says) 'from a Mutton Pye.' Attempts have been
made to attribute its origin to a political gathering of Whig

noblemen and gentlemen, but contemporary authorities all
agree that it was founded by Jacob Tonson, the bookseller;
and Sir R. Blackmore, who wrote a poem called 'the Kitcats'
in 1708, may be considered as knowing something about
what he wrote. Whether the pieman's name was Christopher
Cat, or Christopher, living at the sign of the Cat and Fiddle,
does not much matter: certain it is that the pies from which
the club was named were called Kit Cat's pies.
   Various domiciles have been given to the club, but Sir
R. Blackmore says it was held at the Fountain in the Strand,
a site now occupied by the Cigar Divan, as is denoted by
the name of Fountain Court.
      On the fair Strand by which with graceful Pride,
      Unrival'd Thamis rolls his alternate Tyde,
      Between the Courts which most the People awe,

      Which both the Thames and Town around survey'd.

      Where mighty Vats his chearful Throne support;
      High o'er the Gate he hung his waving Sign,
      A Fountain Red with ever-flowing Wine.

      One Night, in Seven, at this convenient Seat,
      Indulgent BOCAJ 1 did the Muses treat,
      Their Drink was generous Wine, and Kit Cat's Pyes their Meat.
      Here he assembled his Poetic Tribe,
      Past Labours to Reward, and new ones to prescribe;
      Hence did th' Assembly's Title first arise,
      And Kit-Cat Wits sprung first from Kit-Cat's Pyes.

   Another proof, if it were needed, that Tonson was the
founder of the club, is that forty-two of its members pre-
sented him with their portraits, painted by Sir Godfrey
Kneller, to adorn his house at Barn Elms. As the room
was not lofty enough to admit of their being the regulation
size, special canvases were had (36 x 28 in.), and this is
still called Kit Cat size. These portraits are still in exist-
ence, and were all shown at the Art Treasures Exhibition
at Manchester, and some at the International Exhibition of
1862. This club was famous for the toasts engraved on its
drinking glasses, many of which have survived to this day;
and this gave rise to Dr. Arbuthnot's epigram-
           Whence deathless Kit-Cat took his name,
             Few Critics can unriddle:
           Some say from pastry cook it came
             And some from Cat and Fiddle.
           From no trim beaus its name it boasts,
             Grey statesmen or green wits,
           But from this pell mell pack of toasts
             Of old Cats and young Kits.

    There were numerous social clubs, the Beefsteak, and
the Saturday Club, of which Swift makes frequent mention
in his letters to Stella. Take one instance 1 : 'I dined with
lord-treasurer, and shall again to-morrow, which is his day,
when all the ministers dine with him. He calls it whipping
day. It is always on Saturday, and we do indeed usually
rally him about his faults on that day. I was of the original
club, when only poor Lord Rivers, lord keeper, and Lord
Bolinbroke came; but now Ormond, Anglesey, lord Steward,
Dartmouth, and other rabble intrude, and I scold at it; but
now they pretend as good a title as I; and, indeed, many
Saturdays I am not there.' He also belonged to a club or
society for social converse and the encouragement of litera-
ture, which was founded in the latter part of the year 1712.
Its meetings were on Thursday, and it was the custom of the
members to entertain their brethren in turns. He gave one
dinner at the Thatched House 2: 'it will cost me five or six
pounds; yet the secretary says he will give me wine.' But

they soon got extravagant, for their very next dinner is noted
as 'The Duke of Ormond's treat last week cost 20 though
it was only four dishes, and four without a dessert; and I
bespoke it in order to be cheap;' and this did not include
wine. In this society, when money was raised for a bene-
volent purpose, the members were assessed according to their
several estates: thus, the Duke of Ormond paid ten guineas,
Swift half a guinea.
   Steele, in Tatler No. 9, gives an amusing and graphic
account of a club, held at a tavern called the Trumpet, in
Shire Lane; and, to show how prevalent the establishment
of clubs was in this reign, the following are some of suggested
ones (of course only in fun) to be found in the Spectator:
The Amorous, Chit Chat, Everlasting, Fox hunters, Fringe
glove, Hebdomadal, Henpecked, Lazy, Lawyers, Mohock,
Moving, Rattling, The Romp, Sighing, Spectator's, Street,
Twopenny, Ugly, Widows; and the Guardian supplies a list
of supposed clubs of little men, and the Short, Silent, Tall,
and Terrible Clubs.

BUT clubs were not the only social enjoyments. The populace
had, during this reign, many free sights-and the numerous
visits of the Queen to the City provided fine shows gratis.
She dined at Guildhall on the Lord Mayor's day after her
accession, and she visited the City again on November 12
the same year, accompanied by both Houses of Parliament, to
return thanks for the successes at Vigo. Certainly January 19,
1704, was kept as a fast; but on September 7 of that year
the Queen again went to St. Paul's, in commemoration of the
victory at Blenheim and the capture of Gibraltar; and on
January 3, 1705, the standards 1 taken at Blenheim were
carried, by a detachment of horse and foot guards, from the
Tower, and hung up in Westminster Hall.         On the 6th of
the same month the Duke of Marlborough dined, by invita-
tion, with the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, at Goldsmiths'
Hall. Once more the Queen visited St. Paul's, on August 23,
1705, to return thanks for the Duke's forcing the French
lines in Brabant, and yet again for the victory at Ramilies on
  1  There was an engraving made of these standards; and a handbill about it
(Harl. MISS. 5996, 40) is curious, as showing how they pushed trade then. ' The
Colours being only to be seen in Westminster Hall, several Gentlemen and Others
have desired to share in the Commemoration thereof, by placing the Representation
of 'em in their Halls and Houses: And now to accommodate those who are so
disposed, the said Representation with the Imbellishments above mention'd, is
done on fine Imperial Paper, and will in a Day or Two be left at your house for
your Perusal, till call'd for next Day, when you are desired either to return it, or
be pleased to pay Two Shillings and Sixpence to the Person that deliver'd the
Same.'

June 27, 1706. This time, the colours taken were deposited
in the Guildhall, with great pomp, on December 19, 1706:
the Queen, and Prince George, going into St. James's Park
to see them pass. On this occasion the Duke dined with
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, in Vintners' Hall. On
December 30 of the same year, the Queen gave thanks at
St. Paul's for the successes of the last campaign in Spain and
Italy; and, as the newspaper account informs us, 'the Night
ended with Ringing of Bells, Bonfires, Illuminations, and
other Rejoycings.'
   Yet again was there another day of public rejoicing, on
May 1, 1707, to celebrate the union with Scotland, and the
Queen once more visited St. Paul's. But this was to be the
last. On thanksgiving day, July 7, 1713, to celebrate the
conclusion of peace, Anne was too unwell to play her accus-
tomed part, and was reluctantly compelled to abandon it and
remain at home. The fireworks on this occasion were splendid.
'Those in Smithfield began about Ten at Night, and ended
about Eleven; when those upon the Thames, over against
Whitehall, began, and lasted till after Midnight. Besides that
these were in both Places Excellent in their kind, they were
play'd off with the utmost Regularity and good Order; so
that we have not heard of the least Mischief done either upon
the River or in Smithfield;' and, as was observed in the
Guardian, No. 103: 'In short, the artist did his part to
admiration, and was so encompassed with fire and smoke
that one would have thought nothing but a Salamander
could have been safe in such a situation.' But these seem
to have been eclipsed by a display at Dublin in honour of
the Queen's last birthday, February 6, 1714, as is recorded
in the Daily Courant of February 16, 1714.
   The Londoner, too, had his Lord Mayor's Show, with its
fun, perhaps just a trifle rougher than in our day. Owing
to the difference of old and new style, Lord Mayor's day
was on October 29 instead of November 9 as now. Ward
naturally revels in it 1: 'Tuesday 29. Windows in Cheapside
stuck with more Faces at Ten, than the Balconies with
Candles on an Illumination Night. Wicked havock of Neats-

Tongues and Hamms in the Barges about Eleven. Artillery
Men march by two and two, burlesqued in Buff and Bandi-
leers. The Vintners and Brewers, the Butchers and Apothe-
caries justle about precedence; 'Tis pity they are not
incorporated. The Ladies pelted with dead Cats instead of
Squibs from Twelve to Three. Mob tumultuous. Boys
starting to see that which, as the Old Woman said, they
must all come to one Day.' And in the London Spy he gives
a very long account of the show, its pageants, and the rough
humour of the spectators.
   'I took three lads, who are under my Guardianship, a
rambling, in a hackney Coach, to shew them the town; as
the lions, the tombs, Bedlam.'  These were the three great
sights of London: the lions at the Tower, the tombs in
Westminster Abbey, and the poor mad folk in Bedlam. 'To
see the lions 'is proverbial, and these had to be visited by
every one new to the City. In 1703 there were four, two
lions and two lionesses-one with a cub. In this reign three
of the lions died almost at the same time, and it was looked
upon by some as an event of dire portent. Addison laugh-
ingly alludes to the popular idea of something awful happening
on the death of a 'Tower' lion, when, in the Freeholder, he
makes the Jacobite squire ask the keeper whether any of the
lions had fallen sick when Perth was taken, or on the flight
of the Pretender. When dead they were sometimes stuffed,
as Ward relates. He also says there was a leopard, three
eagles, two owls, and a hyena.  That was in 1703; and
Thoresby, writing in 1709, went to see the 'lions, eagles,
catamountains, leopards, &amp;c.' He also relates 2 his experiences
of a visit to the Tower itself: Walked with Mr. Dale to the
Tower; was mightily pleased with the new and excellent
method the Records 3 are put into (of which see a letter of
the Bishop of Carlisle to me;) and viewed many great curi-
osities of that nature, and original letters from foreign kings
and potentates, upon parchment, and paper as old (reckoned
as great a rarity) to the Kings of England, very ancient
tallies, Jewish stars, &amp;c., which the obliging Mr. Holms showed
     1 Tatler, No. 30.    2 Diary, Jan. 21, 1709.
     3 The records were kept in the Tower until the present reign.

me, who also gave me an autograph of Queen Elizabeth, that
was his own property; then went to view the several armouries,
as that more ancient of the weapons taken in the year 1588
from the pretended Invincible Armada, and those modern
from Vigo, and in other memorable transactions of this age;
the present armoury for use is put to a surprising method, in
the form of shields, pyramids, trophies, &amp;c. Some of the
elder and later kings' armour are placed as though mounted
on horseback.'
   Ward also visited the Tower, after seeing the lions, and
has left a most amusing account of what he saw, which is far
too long for transcription. He first noted ' a parcel of Bulky
Wardens, in old fashion'd Lac'd Jackets, and in Velvet Flat
caps, hung round with divers colour'd Ribbonds, like a Fool's
hat upon a Holiday.' Indeed, their costume was identical
with their present state dress, only it was utterly marred by
their wearing portentous periwigs. Under the guidance of
one of these gentry he was shown Traitor's Gate, the White
Tower, and St. Peter's Church; and afterwards, the Grand
Armoury, where he was particularly delighted to see that 'at
the corner of every Lobby, and turning of the Stairs, stood a
Wooden Granadier as Sentinel, painted in his proper Colours,
cut out with much exactness upon Board.' Arrived in the
arsenal, he was handed over to one of the armourer's men,
who had 'everything as ready at his fingers' ends, as the
Fellow that shows the Tombs at Westminster. The first
Figure at our Coming in, that most effected the Eye, by
reason of its bigness, was a long Range of Muskets and
Carbines, that ran the length of the Armory, which was dis-
tinguish'd by a Wilderness of Arms, whose Locks and Barrels
were kept in that admirable Order, that they shone as bright
as a Good Housewifes Spits and Pewter in the Christmas
Holidays, on each side of which were Pistols, Baggonets,
Scimiters, Hangers, Cutlaces, and the like Configurated into
Shields, Triumphal Arches, Gates, Pillasters, Scollopshells,
Mullets, Fans, Snakes, Serpents, Sun Beams, Gorgon's Heads,
the Waves of the Ocean, Stars and Garters, and in the middle
of all, Pillars of Pikes, and turn'd Pillars of Pistols; and at
the end of the Wilderness, fire Arms plac'd in the Order of a

great Organ.' Coming thence, he noticed the Tower rooks,
as he called those men who asked 'Whether you will see the
Crown, the whole Regalia or the King's Marching Train of
Artillery ?' He would have none of them, but went with a
warder into the armoury proper, where he 'View'd the Princely
Scare crows, and he told us to whom each Suit of Armour
did belong Originally, adding some short Memorandums out
of History, to every empty Iron side; some True, some False,
supplying that with Invention, which he wanted in Memory.'
He would not see the Regalia, but got a description of it
from the warder, 'and so Cozened the Keeper of our Eighteen
Pence a piece.' The warder told them 'there was a Royal
Crown, and a new one made for the Coronation of the late
Queen Mary, and three others wore by his Majesty with
Distinct Robes, upon several occasions; also the Salt, Spoons,
Forks and Cups, us'd at the Coronation.' Altogether, a visit
to the Tower then very much resembled one nowadays.
    As to the tombs at Westminster, what more do we want
to know about them, as they then were, than what is con-
tained in Spectator No. 26, where Addison grumbles at Sir
Cloudesley Shovel's monument, 'Instead of the brave rough
English Admiral, which was the distinguishing Character of
that plain gallant Man, he is represented on his Tomb, by
the Figure of a Beau, dress'd in a long Perriwig, and reposing
himself upon Velvet Cushions under a Canopy of State?'
And for all else in the grand old abbey, have we not the
lifelike description of Sir Roger's visit? 1 how he saw Jacob's
pillar, sat in the Coronation Chair, handled Edward the Third's
sword, and afterwards wanted the Spectator to call on him
'at his Lodgings in Norfolk Buildings, and talk over these
Matters with him more at leisure.' It would be a literary
profanity to deal with them except in their entirety.
    But the lions, the tombs, and Bedlam could never be
sufficient recreative pabulum for a large city, so there were
outlets for the exuberance of their spirits in the three fairs,
Bartholomew, May fair, and Southwark. Bartholomew fair
stands pre-eminent, both for its antiquity, its size, and length
of duration. In Anne's time it was no longer the great mart
                        1 Spectator, 329.

for cloth it used to be-and the fair was given over to rioting
and unlimited licence. This fair is a most congenial subject
for Ward's pen, and he gives it free range-too free, alas! for
many extracts. He describes the entrance to it as a 'Bel-
fegor's Concert, the rumbling of Drums, mix'd with the in-
tolerable Squalling of Cat Calls and Penny Trumpets,' so, to
get out of the noise and smell, prominent in which latter was
'the Singeing of Pigs, and burnt Crackling of over Roasted
Pork' (which was a specialty in the fair), he turned into an
ale house, where he had doctored beer, and was so annoyed
by a waiter, who would constantly inquire, 'Do you call,
sirs?' that he threatened to kick him downstairs.  From
this upper room he could see the booths, and note the
humours of the fair: the mock finery of the actors, who were
'strutting round their Balconies in their Tinsey Robes, and
Golden Leather Buskins;' and the sorry buffoonery of the
Merry Andrews. Having rested, he sallied forth into the
fair, saw the rope-dancers, one of whom was a negress, who
set a countryman near Ward into fits of laughter, which he
explained: 'Master, says he, I have oftentimes heard of the
Devil upon two Sticks, but never Zee it bevore in me Life.
Bezide, Maister, who can forbear Laughing to see the Devil
going to Dance ?' He speaks in high terms of the German
rope-dancer, of whom Lauron gives two portraits. He then
went into a booth to see 'a Dwarf Comedy, Sir-nam'd a Droll,'
but does not seem to have cared much about it. He and his
friend then refreshed themselves with 'a Quart of Fill-birds,
and Eat each of us two Penny worth of Burgamy Pears,' and
witnessed another performance. They then needed solid
food, so determined to have a quarter of a pig (sucking pig
of course), and made their way to Pye Corner, 'where Cooks
stood dripping at their Doors, like their Roasted Swine's
Flesh,' but the total absence of cleanliness in the cookery was
so repulsive, that they had to forego the luxury.
   After undergoing the certain penalty of having his hand-
kerchief stolen, he went to see another droll, the plot of which
seems to have been perfectly inexplicable, and he came to
the conclusion that 'Bartholomew Fair Drolls are like State
Fire Works, they never do any Body good, but those that






SIGHT-SEEING and FAIRS.



251



are concern'd in the Show.' The wax-work was then visited,
and then they went to a music and dancing booth, in which
they not only had a most discordant instrumental concert,
but saw a woman 'Dance with Glasses full of Liquor upon
the Backs of her Hands, to which she gave Variety of Motions,
without Spilling,' and a youthful damsel perform a sword
dance, which was succeeded by 'abundance of Insipid Stuff.'
They got away, and passed by the 'Whirligigs,' went into a
raffling shop, and the Groom Porter's, after which he went
to an alehouse to rest himself and smoke a pipe, and finally
went home, thoroughly tired.
   This, then, was a true record of a visit to Bartholomew
Fair, by the aid of which we shall thoroughly appreciate the
following advertisements of the amusements there :-
   'At the great Booth over against the Hospital Gate,
during the time of Bartholomew Fair will be seen the Dancing
on the Ropes, after the French and Italian Fashion, by a
Company of the finest Performers that ever yet have been
seen by the whole World. For in the same Booth will be
seen the two Famous French Maidens, so much admired in
all Places and Countries wherever they come (especially in
Mayfair last), where they gain'd the highest Applause from
all the Nobility and Gentry, for their wonderful Performance
on the Rope, both with and without a Pole; so far out doing
all others that have been seen of their Sex, as gives a general
Satisfaction to all that ever yet beheld them. To which is
added, Vaulting on the High Rope, and Tumbling on the
Stage. As also Vaulting on two Horses, on the great Stage,
at once. The Stage being built after the Italian manner, on
which you will see the Famous Scaramouch and Harlequin.
With several other Surprizing Entertainments, too tedious
here to mention. Perform'd by the greatest Masters now in
Europe. The like never seen before in England.'
   Rope-dancing was evidently very popular, for there is
another booth, in which Blondin is outdone. 'It is there you
will see the Italian Scaramouch dancing on the Rope, with
a Wheel Barrow before him with two Children and a Dog in
it, and with a Duck on his Head; who sings to the Company,
and causes much laughter.' And yet one more, for it intro-

duces us to the most famous rope-dancer of the reign-' Lady
Mary.' 'Her Majesty's Company of Rope Dancers. At
Mr. Barnes and Finly's Booth, between the Hospital Gate
and the Crown Tavern, opposite the Cross Daggers, during
the usual time of Bartholomew Fair, are to be seen the most
famous Rope dancers in Europe. And 1st. 2 young Maidens,
lately arrived from France, Dance with and without a Pole
to admiration. 2. The Famous Mr. Barnes, of whose per-
formances this Kingdom is so sensible, Dances with 2
Children at his Feet, and with Boots and Spurs. 3. Mrs.
Finly distinguished by the name of Lady Mary for her
incomparable Dancing, has much improv'd herself since the
last Fair.' Lady Mary is frequently mentioned in contem-
porary literature, and on one occasion is alluded to 'as little
dressed as Lady Mary.' This probably arose from her dis-
pensing with petticoats in dancing. The German rope-dancer,
immortalised by Lauron, is dressed in a fine frilled Holland
shirt, trunk hose, and tights-in fact, the usual acrobatic dress;
and Ward notices two dancers, 'who, to show their Affection
to the Breeches wor'em under their Petticoats; which, for
decency's sake, they first Danc'd in; But they doft their
Petticoats after a gentle breathing.' This probably accounts
for the caustic remark in the Spectator (No. 51), 'The
Pleasantry of stripping almost Naked has been since prac-
tised (where indeed it should have begun) very successfully
at Bartholomew Fair.'
   There were, also, natural curiosities to be seen. 'At the
next Door to the Sign of the Greyhound in Smithfield, is
to be shown (by Her Majesty's Order) a Wonderful and
Miraculous Sight, a Male Child which was born in Garnsey
of the body of Rebecca Secklin, and now sucks at her Breasts,
being but Thirty Weeks old, with a prodigious big Head,
being above a yard about, and hath been shown to several
Persons of Quality.'
   'By Her Majesties Authority. At the Hart's Horn's Inn
in Pye Corner, during the time of Bartholomew Fair, will be
seen these strange Rarities following, viz. A Little Farey
Woman, lately come from Italy, being but Two Foot Two
Inches high, the shortest that ever was seen in England, and

no ways Deform'd, as the other two Women are, that are
carried about the Streets in Boxesfrom House to House, for
some years past, this being Thirteen Inches shorter than either
of them; if any Person has a desire to see her at their own
Houses, we are ready to wait upon them any Hour of the
Day.
   'Likewise a little Marmazet from Bengal that dances the
Cheshire Rounds,1 and Exercises at the Word of Command.
Also a strange Cock from Hamborough, having Three proper
Legs, Two Fundaments, and makes use of them both at one
time. Vivat Reginae' (sic).
   'Next Door to the Golden Hart in West Smithfield,
between the Hospital Gate and Pye Corner during the time
of Bartholomew Fair, is to be seen the Admirable Work of
Nature, a Woman having three Breasts; and each of them
affording Milk at one time or differently, according as they
are made use of. There is likewise to be seen the Daughter
of the same Woman, which hath breasts of the like Nature,
according to her Age; and there never hath been any ex-
tant of such sort, which is wonderful to all that ever did, or
shall behold her.'
    Theatrical performances naturally took a prominent part;
for the two theatres shut up during Fair time, and Mills,
Doggett, and Penkethman, all fair actors, and belonging to
the regular stage, had booths here, and did well; in fact,
Penkethman became wealthy. As Ward remarks 2: 'After
struggling with a Long See-Saw, between Pride and Profit;
and having Prudently consider'd the weighty difference
between the Honourable Title of one of His Majesties
Servants, and that of a Bartholomew Fair Player, a Vagabond
by the Statue, did at last, with much difficulty, conclude,
That it was equally Reputable to Play the Fool in the Fair
for Fifteen or Twenty Shillings a Day, as 'twas to please
Fools in the Play House at so much a week.'
    At Parker's Booth was played the Famous History of
 Dorastus and Fawnia, 'With very pleasant Dialogues and
 Antick Dances.'
    'Never Acted before. At Miller's Booth, over against
            1 See Appendix,        2 London Spy,

the Cross Daggers, near the Crown Tavern, during the time
of Bartholomew Fair will be presented an Excellent new
Droll call'd

         'The Tempest, or the Distressed Lovers,

With the English HERO and the Highland Princess, with the
Comical Humours of the Inchanted Scotchman, or Jockey
and the three Witches. Shewing how a Nobleman of
England was cast away upon the Indian Shore, and in his
Travels found the Princess of the Country, with whom he
fell in Love, and after many Dangers and Perils, was married
to her; and his faithful Scotchman, who was saved with him,
travelling thorow Woods, fell in among Witches, where be-
tween 'em is abundance of Comical Diversion. There in the
Tempest, is Neptune with his Tritons in his Chariot drawn
with Sea Horses and Mairmaids singing. With Variety of
Entertainments, Performed by the best Masters; the Par-
ticulars would be too tedious to be inserted here. Vivat
Regina.'

   There seems to have been another version of this play,
which, after all, was only a travesty of Shakespeare's
'Tempest.'
   'At Doggett's Booth, Hosier Lane End, during the Time
of Bartholomew Fair, will be presented a New Droll, called
the Distress'd Virgin, or Unnatural Parents, Being a True
History of the Fair Maid of the West; or The Loving

of his Master's Daughter, and his encounter with Three

   Here we see a departure from the old drolls, and a
reliance on the part of the management on mechanical and
spectacular effects: besides which, there was the puppet
show, pure and simple.   'By Her Majesties Permission.

   There was a famous Merry Andrew who used to act for
Pinkethman, and who, at other times, followed the vocation
of a Horse Doctor. There is a very curious elegy upon him,
still extant 1:
          That us'd to visit Smithfield or May Fair,
          To pertake of the Lewdness that is acted there;
          T' oblige the Mobb, that did some Pastime lack,

          Forsake a Fortnight, then that time expir'd
          The Name of Doctor was again acquird.

   Occasionally there were rather more refined exhibitions,
but they were very rare. Here is one, 'In the first Booth on
the left Hand from the Hospital Gate, over against the Royal
Oak Lottery, in Bartholomew Fair, from 9 o'clock in the
Morning till 9 at Night, will be exposed to publick View,

    Bartholomew Fair began on August 24 of each year,
being St. Bartholomew's Day, and lasted fourteen days. In
1691 and 1694 it was reduced to the old term of-three days,
and in 1697, 1700, and 1702 stage plays were prohibited in
the fair. The revenue derived from it formed part of the
income of the Lord Mayor, and in 1697 a proposal was
made to allow the Lord Mayor 4,000&pound;. a year for the main-
tenance of his office, and abolish his perquisites; when
Bartholomew Fair was valued at 100&pound;. per annum.
   On June 2, 1708, 'the Common Council of this City
Mett, and the lease for holding Bartholomew Fair expiring
the 11th of August, agreed, That for the future none should
be kept for Stage Plays, raffling Shops &amp;c. which tend to
debauchery; but only 3 dayes for the sale of leather and
Cattle, according to its antient custome.' 1 The raffling shops
were clearly illegal, for the same writer says, October 11,
1705: 'Yesterday the grand jury found bills of indictment
against all those persons who kept raffling shops in the
Cloysters during Bartholomew fair.' But all the legislation
in the world was impotent to put down this fair, until, in this
century, public opinion as to the expedience of fairs was
changed, and 'Bartlemy' fair was proclaimed for the last
time in 1855.
   May Fair, or, as it was originally called, St. James's Fair,
was of old date, as Machyn mentions it in his 'Diary for
1560.' Pepys, also, calls it by the latter name when he
speaks of it: its name of May fair was comparatively recent,
and was, of course, owing to its being held in that month.
It was held on the north side of Piccadilly, and seems to

have had even a more evil repute than Bartholomew Fair.
The' Observator says: 'Can any rational men imagine that
her Majesty would permit so much lewdness as is committed
in May Fair, for so many days together, so near to
her royal Palace, if she knew anything about the matter ?'
Anyhow the fair flourished during the major portion of Anne's
reign.
   The shows were very much like those at the larger fair.
Here is one in 1702: 'At MILLER'S Booth in May Fair, the
Second Booth on the Right Hand coming into the Fair, over
against the Famous Mr. Barnes the Rope Dancer, will be
presented an Excellent Droll, call'd Crispin and Crispianus;
or a Shoemaker a Prince. With the Comical Humours of
Barrady and the Shoemaker's Wife. With the best Machines,
Singing and Dancing, ever yet in the Fair. Where the Famous
Ladder Dancer performs those things upon the Ladder
never before seen, to the Admiration of all Men. Vivat
Regina.'
   'Lady Mary' was at the same fair, and advertises herself
by means of a disclaimer: ' Whereas it hath been maliciously
reported that Mrs. Finley, who for her incomparable Dancing
on the Rope, is unwillingly distinguish'd by the Name of the
Lady Mary, was Dead; This is to inform all Persons, That
the said Report is Notoriously false, she now being in Mr.
Barnes's and Finley's Booth, over against Mr. Pinkethman
and Mr. Simson's, next to Mr. Mills, and Mr. Bullock's in
May Fair,' &amp;c. And she was there again in 1704: 'At Mr.
Finley and Mr. Barnes's Booth, During the time of May Fair,
will be seen a Compleat Company of near 20 of the best
Rope Dancers, Vaulters and Tumblers in Europe, who are all
excellent in their several Performances, and do such won-
derful and surprizing things, as the whole World cannot
parallel; where Finley, who gave that extraordinary satisfac-
tion before Charles III. King of Spain on Board the Royal
Katherine, performs several new entertainments, and where
the Lady Mary, likewise shows such additions to her former
admirable perfections, as renders her the wonder of the
whole world.' She was very popular, as Pinkethman some-
what bitterly remarks in the 'Epilogue to the Bath' (acted






262    SOCIAL LIFE in the reign of QUEEN ANNE.



at Drury Lane, 1701), where he says he made grimaces to
empty benches, while Lady Mary had carried all before her:-
              Gadzooks, what signified my Face ?

   This, however, did not prevent Pinkethman from going
there again; for in 1704 he issued the following advertise-
ment: 'In Brookfield Marketplace at the East corner of
Hide Park, is a Fair to be kept for the space of Sixteen days,
beginning the First of May: The first three days for Live
Cattle and Leather, with the same Entertainment as at Bar-
tholomew Fair, where there are shops to be Lett ready built,
for all manner of Tradesmen that usually keep Fairs; and
so to continue yearly at the same Time and place; being a
Free Fair; and no person to be arrested or molested during
the Time of this Fair by Virtue of Pye Powder Court. And
at Mr. Pinkeman's Droll Booth will be performed several
Entertainments which will be expressed at large upon the
Bills, especially one very surprizing that the whole World
never yet produced the like, viz, He speaks an Epilogue upon
an Elephant between Nine and Ten Foot high, arriv'd from
Guinea, led upon the Stage by Six Blacks. The Booth is
easily known by the Picture of the Elephant and Mr. Pin-
kethman sitting in State on his back, on the outside of
his Booth. Any body that wants Ground for Shops or
Booths, may hire it of Mr. Pinkeman, enquire at the Bull
Head in Brookfield Market, alias May Fair.'
   He was there again in 1707. 'At Pinkeman's Booth in
May Fair, to entertain the Quality, Gentry, and others, he
has got Eight Dancing Doggs, brought from Holland, which
are Admir'd by all that see them: and they will dance upon
Mr. Pinkeman's Stage in each Show. This Extraordinary
Charge he's at (in procuring these Doggs) is purely to divert
the Town. They are the Wonder of the World, The last
Show beginning between 8 & 9 a Clock for the Entertainment
of the Quality, as the Park breaks up.'
   There was another theatrical company: 'At the NEW
PLAY HOUSE in MAY FAIR, During the time of the FAIR
will be Play'd, the True and Ancient Story of MAUDLIN the
Merchants Daughter of BRISTOL and her lover ANTONIO.

How they were Cast away in a Tempest upon the Coast of
Barbary; where the Mermaids were seen floating on the
Seas, and Singing on the Rocks, foretelling their danger. The
DROLL intermingled with most delightful merry Comedy,
after the manner of an OPERA, with extraordinary variety of
Singing and Dancing: By his Grace the Duke of Southamp-
ton's Servants. The Place will be Known by the Balcone
adorn'd with Blue Pillars twisted with Flowers. Vivat Regina.'
   May Fair boasted of its natural curiosities, as the two
following advertisements testify: 'Near Hide Park Corner
during the Time of May Fair, near the Sheep pens over
against Mr. Penkethman's Booth; Is to be seen the Wonder
of the World in Nature, being a Mail Child born with a Bear
growing on its Back alive, to the great Admiration of all
Spectators, having been shown before most of the Nobility
of the Land.'
   'By Her Majesties Permission. This is to give Notice to
all Gentlemen, Ladies and others, that coming into May Fair,
the first Booth on the left Hand, over against Mr. Pinke-
mans Booth; During the usual time of the Fair, is to be
seen, a great Collection of Strange and Wonderful Rarities,
all Alive from several parts of the World.
   'A little Black Man lately brought from the West Indies,
being the Wonder of this Age, he being but 3 Foot high and
25 Years Old.
   'Likewise 2 Wood Monsters from the East Indies, Male
and Female, being the Admirablest Creaturs that ever was

soever, and are so Wonderful in Nature that it is too large
to insert here.
   'Also a little Marmoset from the East Indies, which by
a great deal of Pains is now brought to that perfection, that
no Creature of his Kind ever perform'd the like; he Exercises

also dances with 2 Naked Swords, and performs several other

   The 'London Spy' would be incomplete without an
account of a scene so congenial as May Fair, so of course he
visited it; but it does not appear to have vied in any degree
with Bartholomew Fair. 'We order'd the Coach to drive
thro' the Body of the Fair that we might have the better
View of the Tinsey Heroes and the gazing Multitude; ex-
pecting to have seen several Corporations of Stroling Vaga-
bonds, but there prov'd but one Company, amongst whom
Merry Andrew was very busie in coaxing the attentive Crowd
into a good Opinion of his Fraternitie's and his own Per-
formances; and when with abundance of Labour, Sweat,
and Nonsense he had drawn a great cluster of the Mob on
his Parade, and was just beginning to encourage them to
Walk in and take their Places his unlucky opposite, whose
boarded Theatre entertain'd the Publick with the wonderful
activity of some little Indian Rope Dancers, brings out a

did on the one side, was mimick'd by the little Flat nos'd
Comedians on the other, till the two Diminutive Buffoons,
by their Comical Gestures had so prevail'd upon the gaping
Throng, that tho' Merry Andrew had taken pains, with all
the wit he had to collect the Stragling Rabble into their
proper order, yet like an unmannerly Audience, they turn'd
their Backs upon the Players, and devoted themselves wholly
to the Monkeys, to the great vexation of Tom Fool and all
the Strutting train of imaginary Lords and Ladies. At last
comes an Epitome of a Careful Nurse, drest up in a Country
Jacket, and under her Arm a Kitten for a Nurslin, and in her
contrary hand a piece of Cheese; down sits the little Matron
with a very Motherly Countenance, and when her Youngster

as great signs of Affections as a loving Mother could well
shew to a disorder'd Infant; then bites a piece of the Cheese,

as I have seen some Nasty Old Sluts feed their Grand-

   The other shows in the fair seem to have been very poor:
two or three dancing booths, a puppet show, a Turkey Ram,
with as much Wooll upon his Tail as would load a Wheel-
barrow,' and a couple of tigers, were all Ward could find
worth recording.
   The fair was disorderly, and in 1702 an incident occurred
which materially assisted its downfall. 'Westminster, May 16.
The Constables of this Liberty being more than ordinary
vigilant in the discharge of their duty, since the coming forth
of her Majesty's pious Proclamation again Vice and De-
bauchery, and having in pursuance thereof taken up several
Lewd Women in May Fair, in order to bring them to Justice,
were opposed therein by several rude Soldiers, one of whom
is committed to Prison, and the rest are diligently enquired
after.' 1 In fact, among them they managed to kill a constable,
named John Cooper-for which murder a fencing-master
named Cook was afterwards hanged at Tyburn; and, although
the fair lingered a few years longer, yet it became such a
nuisance that in November 1708 the Grand Jury of West-
minster 'did present as a publick Nuisance and Incon-
venience, the yearly riotous and tumultuous Assembly in a
place called Brook Field, in the Parish of St. Martins in the
Fields, in this County, called May Fair.' 2
   This was the beginning of its end, and 1708 saw the last
of the fair. 'Saturday 30 April 1709. Yesterday was pub-
lished a proclamation by her Majestie, prohibiting the erecting
or making use of any booths or stalls in Mayfair, for any
plays, shows, gaming, musick meetings, or other disorderly
assemblies.' 3 That this had been expected is shown by Steele,
writing on April 18, 1709. ' Advices from the upper end of
Piccadilly say, that May Fair is utterly abolished.' 4
   The Tatler (No. 21) makes merry over its downfall, and
says, 'if any lady or gentleman have occasion for a tame
elephant, let them enquire of Mr. Pinkethman, who has one to
dispose of at a reasonable rate. The downfall of May-fair

' The Ball of Little Dogs come from Lovain, which performs,

whose Dexterity is not to be compared; he dances with
Mrs. Poncette his Mistress, and the rest of their Company at
the sound of Instruments; observes so well the Cadance,
that they amaze every Body. They have danced in most of
the Courts of Europe, especially before the Queen and most
of the Quality of England. They are carried to Persons of
Qualities Houses if required. They stay but a little while in
this Place. They give a General Satisfaction to all People
that see them.'
   Here also was to be seen the English Sampson, William
Joyce, described by Ward as 'the Southwark Sampson, who
breaks Carmens Ribs with a Hug, snaps Cables like Twine
Thread, and throws Dray Horses upon their backs, with as
much Ease as a Westphalia Hog can crack a Cocoa Nut.'
When he exhibited before William III., he lifted 1 ton and
14  1/2 lbs. of lead, tied a very strong rope round him to which
was attached a strong horse, which, although whipped, failed
to move him: this rope he afterwards snapped like pack thread.
'We are credibly inform'd that the said Mr. Joyce pull'd up
a Tree of near a Yard and a half Circumference by the Roots
at Hamstead on Tuesday last in the open View of some
Hundreds of People, it being modestly computed to Weigh
near 2000 weight.'

BUT it must not be imagined that these fairs monopolised all
the rarities and natural curiosities. On the contrary, there
were plenty on exhibition elsewhere, as we shall see. 'This is
to give Notice to all Gentlemen, Ladies, and Others, that the
Great Ox that hath been so long talk'd of, and that hath
been in the News so often, is now come to London, and is to
be seen any Hour of the Day, at the White Horse Inn in
Fleet Street, at the same place where the great Elephant was
seen. This Large and Famous Beast, otherwise called the
True Lincolnshier Ox, is Nineteen Hands High, and Four
Yards Long, from his Face to his Rump, and never was
Calv'd nor never Suckt, and two Years ago was no bigger
than another Ox, but since is grown to this Prodigious Big-
ness. This Noble Beast was lately shown at the University
of Cambridge, with great Satisfaction to all that saw him.
The like Beast for Bigness was never seen in the World
before. Vivat Reginae' (sic). Other dimensions are given
when it was exhibited at May Fair. ' His shin being 36 inches
round, and an Ell broad from Huckle Bone to Huckle Bone
across the Back.' The following looks suspiciously like a
newspaper puff: 'Yesterday the 17th Instant, was proffer'd
for the Great Lincolnshire Ox, 350 Guineas.'1

   Then there was a 'Large Buckinghamshire Hog, above
10 Foot long; 13 Hands high; above 7 foot and a half
round the Body; almost 5 Foot round the Neck, and 18 inches
round the fore Leg, above the Joynt.' And 'At the White
Horse in Fleet Street' could be seen the 'Wonderful Wor-
cestershire Mare 19 Hands high, curiously shaped, every way
proportionable.'
   These were native productions, and, although abnormal,
could not compete with rarities from foreign lands-especially
with the whale, vide Daily Courant, September 15, 1712:
'There being last Week a Royal Parmacitty Whale taken in
the Thames, which is the noblest Fish ever seen in England,
the same will for the curiosity of Gentlemen, &amp;c., be exposed
to view in a Barge near the Faulcon over against Black Fryers
at 2d. a piece.' It got rather odoriferous by keeping, so we
read in the Daily Courant of September 22, that 'the Royal
Whale, supposed to be the Spermacete so much admired,
will be exposed to Sale by Auction to-morrow at 4 o'clock.'
Its purchaser is unknown, but we hear of it again: 'We
called at the Isle of Dogs to see the Skeleton of a whale,
forty-eight yards long, and thirty-five round.'
   Of course there was no Zoological Society at that time,
and the only way of seeing foreign animals was by small
private collections, which, for want of capital, never contained
any very rare specimens. Still, it was something even to get
this, and we must not forget that our own Zoological collec-
tion is the work of the present century, and is an example
followed by scarcely any other town in England, where still,
as in the villages, people are dependent upon the travelling
menageries for any practical knowledge they may possess of
the natural history of any land other than their own. In
London a permanent collection of wild beasts, or at all events
lions and tigers, had existed at the Tower, where once was a
white bear, which used, duly fastened by a cord, to fish in the
Thames; and we have seen that these animals were one of
the principal sights of the city.
   'At the White Horse Inn in Fleet Street, any time of the
Day or Evening,' were to be seen '1. A little Black Hairy

Male and Female, the Male being the largest that ever was
in England, being seven foot high, and ten foot in length;
his common burden is twelve hundredweight, with which he
travels 40 miles a day; there is also to be seen a Civet Cat
giveing a pleasant smell throughout the Room. Likewise a
Wolf and other wild beasts are there to be seen at any time
of the day (all being alive).'
   A dromedary seems to have been considered a great
curiosity, and the following advertisement gives a wonderful
description of it. 'By Her Majesties Authority. Betwixt
the Queen's Head and Crooked Billet near Fleet Bridge. This
is to give notice to all Gentlemen, Ladies, and others, that
there is here to be seen, two strange wonderful and re-
markable monstrous Creatures, an old She Dromodary, being
seven foot high, and ten foot long, lately arriv'd from Tartary,
and her young One, being the greatest Rarity and Novelty
that ever was seen in the three Kingdoms before. These Crea-
tures is much admired above all other Creatures in their way
of bringing forth their young, for they go fourteen Months
with young; these Creatures resembles several sorts of
Creatures, and yet but one at the last; they are headed like
a Horse, ey'd like an Ox, nos'd like a Deer, cloven Lipt like
a Hare, also neck'd like a Swan, and Tail'd like a Mule, and
cloven footed like a Cow, also the young Creature shewing
several Actions by the word of Command. Note also that
natural Dromodarys (as these be) are the swiftest Creatures
upon Earth: These Creatures are to be seen at any hour

   ' By Her Majesty's Authority. Is to be seen, the Hand
of a Sea Monster which was lately taken on the Coasts of
Denmark; the whole Creature was very large, and weigh'd
(according to Computation) at least fifty Tuns, and was
seventy foot in length: His upper part resembled a Man;
from the middle downwards he was a Fish, &amp;c. Likewise
there is a Man Teger, lately brought from the East Indies, a
most strange and wonderful Creature, the like never seen

and his hinder parts all Hairy; having a long Head of Hair,

There is also a famous Porcupine, a Martin Drill, a Pecari
from the Deserts of Arabia, the Bone of a Giant above a
Yard long, with several other Monstrous Creatures too diffi-
cult to describe, all alive.  This is to give notice that the
Man Teger is removed from Holborn Bars to the sign of
the George against the steps of Upper More Fields. Vivat

   'This is to give Notice to all Gentlemen, Ladies, and
Others, that are Lovers of Ra-arities, that over against the
Muse Gate, near Chairing Cross, is to be seen the same
Creature that was shown at Epsom and the Bath all this
Summer. This Noble Creature, which much resembles a
Wild Hairy Man, was lately taken in a Wood at Bengall in
the East Indies, he Dances upon the strait Rope with a Pole
in his hands, he cuts Capers upon the Rope, and Dances true
to the Musick.  Likewise this Creature walks the Steep
Rope with a Pole in his hands. He walks upon a small
Slack Rope Swinging, at the same time drinks a Glass of
Ale, and all this is performed on a Rope no bigger than a
penny Cord; and swings on it, to the great Admiration of
all Spectators. He pulls off his Hat, and pays his Respects
to the Company, and smoaks a Pipe of Tobacco as well as
any Christian. This Noble Creature flings a Strapader, and
hangs by his Hands and his Feet, and performs such Won-
derful Things, that ne'er was done by any Rope Dancer
whatever.' This was the rope-dancer spoken of by Addison:
' He is by birth a Monkey; but swings upon a Rope, takes a
pipe of Tobacco, and drinks a glass of Ale, like any reason-
able Creature.' 1
   Occasionally, but very rarely, the nobler beasts were shown.
'At the Duke of Marlborough's Head in Fleet Street, is to
be seen these Rarities following. 1. The noble and majes-
tick Lion, lately brought from Barbary, which for its most
surprizing Largeness, and its being so wonderful tame, far

Lion lately brought over from Algier, so wonderful tame
that any Person may handle him as well as his keeper. 3.
The noble Panther lately brought from Egypt, one of the
beautifullest Creatures in the World for variety of Spots of
divers Colours; a Creature much admired by all the Gentle-
men, and Ladies that ever saw him. 4. The Noble Pelican
or Vulture, lately arrived from America 3 foot high, 9 over.

   A rhinoceros could only be seen stuffed, and with its
skeleton.
   In the latter part of 1711 there was a show of 'the
Lest Man and Hors in the World,' which Addison has
immortalised in the Spectator (No. 271), saying that the man,.
his wife, and horse 'are so very light, that when they are put
together into a Scale, an ordinary Man may weigh down the
whole Family.' These were combined with some wild
animals, which evidently would not pay to exhibit by them-
selves.

    ' There were giants in the earth in those days,' and at the
'Hercules's Pillars at Charing Cross' might be seen a German
giant, seven and a half feet high, and an Italian giantess
'above Seven foot high, and every way proportionable
weighing 425 Pounds Weight.' This seems to have been
the normal height of giants, for the Saxon giant who was
' but Twenty Five Years of Age, he is Seven Foot and Five
Inches in height, and every way Proportionable.' He was
shown to the Queen and Prince George at Windsor; but,
previously, 'he had the Honour to be presented with a piece
of Armour proportionable to his Bigness, by the King of the
Romans.'
    Germany, however, was not to have the monopoly of sup-
plying us with giants-that, our patriotism could not stand-
so a real live British giant was produced, warranted genuine.
The only fault about him is that he does not state his height,
so that we have no means of comparing him with the foreign

   'There is lately brought to this Place from America a
Savage; being a Cannibal Indian or Man Eater who was
taken in a Skirmish near South Carolina, between the Natives
of that Place and some of the Wild Savage Men. Likewise
an Indian Woman, a Princess of that Country.'
   Divers freaks of humanity were shown, but it requires

















some credulity to take in the following: 'At the Herculus
Pillars at Charring Cross, is to be seen a Girl that was found
on a Mountain, in the west of England; When an Eminent
Gentlewoman observing her to be without Fingers or Toes;
and without Speech, in regard to her Distress, ordered her to
be brought to her Habitation; this Gentlewoman for many
Years, was troubled with Convulsions of a severe kind, was
perfectly Cured in a very short time, by the Girls Stroaking.

and what is very Remarkable also in her; She never spoke
one Word in Four Years, and then by a Prophetick Spirit,
said, the Gentlewoman that preserved her, would Die by Two
a Clock which happened accordingly. The Girl is Ingenious,
and can Work at her Needle; and perform several other
things worth Observation; Price for seeing her Six Pence a
Piece. She Toucheth Gratis.'
   ' This young Man was Born in Hungary, and is about 18
years of Age, a Foot and a Half High: In the places where
the Thighs, or Legs should be; hath Two Breasts in all
points like a Woman's on which He Walks. The Natural
parts are of the Male kind; Climes, or gets from the Ground
upon a Table, and sits on a Corner of it, but 3 Quarters of
an Inch broad, and shews more Artful Tricks, to the General
Diversion, Satisfaction, and Admiration of all Spectators, and
speaks several Languages. Vivat Regina.'
   The following, although a curious, could hardly have been
a pleasing, exhibition. 'The Bold Grimace Spaniard. At
the Ram's Head Inn in Fanchurch Street, is to be seen a
Bold Grimace Spaniard, lately brought over, by David Corn-
well, in the Bilboa Merchant: He liv'd 15 Years among wild
Creatures in the Mountains, and is reasonably suppos'd to
have been taken out of his Cradle, an Infant, by some Savage
Beast, and wonderfully preserv'd, 'till some Comedians ac-
cidently pass'd thro' those Parts, and perceiving him to be of
human Race, pursu'd him to his Cave, where they caught
him in a Net. They found something wonderful in his
Nature, and took him with 'em in their Travels thro' Spain
and Italy. He performs the following surprising Grimaces,
viz. He lolls out his Tongue a Foot long, turns his Eyes in
and out at the same time; contracts his Face as small as an
Apple; extends his Mouth six Inches, and turns it into the
Shape of a Bird's Beak, and his Eyes like to an Owl's; turns
his Mouth into the Form of a Hat cock'd up three ways;
and also frames it in the manner of a four square Buckle;
licks his Nose with his Tongue, like a Cow; rolls one Eye
Brow two Inches up, the other two down; changes his face
to such an astonishing Degree, as to appear like a Corpse
long buried; Altho bred wild so long, yet by travelling with

the aforesaid Comedians 18 years, he can sing wonderfully
fine, and accompanies his Voice with a thorow Bass on the
Lute. His former natural Estrangement from human Con-
versation obliged Mr. Cornwell to bring a Jackanapes over
with him for his Companion, in whom he takes great Delight
and Satisfaction.'
   Queen Anne's time could also match our age with 'Two
Headed Nightingales,' 'Siamese Twins,' or 'Pygopagi.' 'At
Mr. John Pratt's, at the Angel in Cornhil . . . are to be seen
two Girls, who are one of the greatest Wonders in Nature
that ever was seen, being Born with their Backs fasten'd to
each other, and the Passages of their Bodies are both one
way. These Children are very Handsome and Lusty, and
Talk three different Languages; they are going into the
7th year of their Age. Those who see them, may very well
say, they have seen a Miracle, which may pass for the 8th
Wonder of the World.' These were Helen and Judith, who
were born at Tzoni, in Hungary, October 26, 1701; lived to
the age of twenty-one, and died in a convent at Petersburg
February 23, 1723. They were well shaped, very good look-
ing, and very fond of each other. They spoke Hungarian,
high and low Dutch, French, and English.
   There was also exhibited 'A young fresh country Lad
just arriv'd from Suffolk; who is covered all over his Body,
except the Face, Palms of the Hands, and Soles of his Feet,
with Bristles like a Hedgehog, as hard as Horn, which shoots
off yearly.'
   'There is lately arrived a Person that was born without
either Arms or Hands, and he does such miraculous things
with his Feet, that the like never was known in the World.
   .... He writes very fine with his Mouth, right and left Foot
without discerning, which is the best, and in five sorts of
Languages, and makes his own Pens with a Pen Knive; he
walks upon his two great Toes, and stands upon one Toe;
he lays his Foot in his Neck, and hops upon the other, he
stands upon the top of a little Stool, and reaches a Glass
with his Mouth from under it; he threads a very fine and
small Needle, and sows very prettily; and all Actions what-
soever is done by Hands, he does with his Feet: he Combs

or dresses a Perriwig very well, shaves himself, dresses and
undresses himself &amp;c., and all with his feet, &amp;c.'
   There were conjurors, especially 'the incomparable Ger-
man. ... He makes pass through his Cups 60 Balls, with-
out touching them, and they are turn'd into little live Birds,
which whistle upon the Table. He takes a parcel of Cards,
and throws them about the Room, and they are turn'd into
little live Birds.' He was only equalled by 'An admirable
Piece of Ingenuity in Hanging Sword Court, the Middle of
Fleet Street,' where twice a day 'several Persons may
                            be Entertained at Table, with
                            various Dishes, and different
                            kinds of Liquors, arising from
                            Fountains on the Table to the
                            drinking Glasses of the Enter-
                            tained; of the which, when
                            they are satisfied, a Serpent
                            arising from a Box on the
                            Middle of the Table, flyeth
                            away with the Table and what's
                            thereon remaining; and that
                            very moment another Table of
                            the same Dimensions, and fur-
                            nished with another service, is
                            in place where the former Table
                            stood, without any visible
                            Cause.'
    Posture masters, as the acrobats were then called, abounded,
 and one of the chief among them was Higgins, successor to
 the famous Clark, who could dislocate and deform himself at
 pleasure. But he must have found a worthy imitator in 'The
 young Posture Master from Exeter, who performs those Pos-
 tures of Body, that none never yet did; he extends his Body
 into all deform'd Shapes of Stature; he makes his Hip and
 Shoulder Bones meet together; he stands upon one Leg and
 extends the other in a direct Line half a Yard above his
 Head; he drinks her Majesty's Health on his Head; he lays
 his Head on the Ground, and turns his Body round twenty
 Times, without stirring his Face from the Place; he sucks all

his Bowels into his Breast, making a pack Saddle on his Back,
that he will bear the lustiest Man that will be pleas'd to sit
upon his Rump; he will sit in a Posture as if his Body was
split, and so divides his Legs that his Toes are separated
Six Foot ten Inches from Toe to Toe; he stands on a Table
and turns his Head backwards below his Heels; he likewise
dances any Dance upon his Knees with his Toes in his Hands,
and dances true to the Musick.' But even all these accom-
plishments do not seem to have been sufficiently attractive of
themselves, for with him was 'a Child of five Years of Age,
who does the Activity of Tumbling to the greatest Per-
fection. After which, Mr. Cornwall takes an empty Bag,
and turns it twenty times, and stamps on it, if requir'd, and
then commands several Eggs out of it, and at last the live
Hen.'
   Children then, as now, had to go through acrobatic per-
formances. There was 'a Boy that walks upon a Slack Rope
no thicker than a Penny Cord, and a little Girl that vaults on
the high Rope;' but, even in our time, we should hardly like
to see ' a little Child about two Years and a half old, perform
such wonderful things on the Stiff Rope, as is surprising to
all that behold him.' We hear more of this poor little thing.
'Whereas it has been industriously and falsly reported that
the little Child that is under 3 years old, that danced on the
Rope and tumbled, is dead; Mr. Francis thought it proper
to certify all People, that the Child is living and well; and
he challenges all Europe to produce a Child of his Age to
perform what he does, both for Dancing and Tumbling. Like-
wise the little Girl about 7 Years old, that danced the Rope,
vaulted the Slack Rope, and tumbled to the Admiration of
all who saw her.'
   There was a curious entertainment that lasted nearly the
whole of Anne's reign; of which the first notice I can find is
in the Daily Courant, November 27, 1704. By degrees Clench
enlarged his repertoire until he did all described in the
accompanying handbill. 'These are to give Notice to all
Gentlemen, Ladies and Others, that Mr. Clench of Barnet who
imitates the Horn, Huntsman and Pack of Hounds, the Sham
Doctor, Old Woman, Drunken Man, the Bells, Flute, Double

Curtell, l the Organ with three Voices, by his own Natural
Voice, to the greatest Perfection; (being the only man that
ever could Attain to so great an Art,) will perform,' etc.
Clinch is mentioned in the Tatler (No. 51): 'A good com-
pany of us were this day to see, or rather to hear, an artful
person do several feats of activity with his throat and wind-
pipe. The first thing wherewith he presented us, was a ring
of bells, which he imitated in a most miraculous manner;
after that, he gave us all the different notes of a pack of
hounds, to our great delight and astonishment.' Thoresby
went to see him, and reports: 2 'Evening to hear the memor-
able Mr. Clench, whose single voice, as he has learned to
manage it, can admirably represent a number of persons, at
sport and in hunting, and the very dogs and other animals,
but none better than a quire of Choristers chanting an
anthem, &amp;c.'
   Waxwork figures have always been a popular exhibition,
and then was living a Mrs. Salmon, whose fame was as great
as Madame Tussaud's.  Her handbills were curiosities in
their way, but they are so long that one only can be tran-
scribed. 'The Royal Off Spring: Or, the Maid's Tragedy
Represented in Wax Work, with many Moving Figures and
these Histories Following. King Charles the First upon the
Fatal Scaffold, attended by Dr. Juxon the Bishop of London,
and the Lieutenant of the Tower, with the Executioner and
Guards waiting upon our Royal Martyr. The Royal Seraglio,

of Ireniae Princess of Persia, and the fair Sultaness Urania.

the Emperor, was sentenced to be starved to Death, but was
preserved by Sucking his Daughter's Breast. Old Mother
Shipton that Famous English Prophetess, which fortold the
Death of the White King; All richly dress'd and composed
with so much variety of Invention, that it is wonderfully
Diverting to all Lovers of Art and Ingenuity. All made by
Mrs. Salmon, and to be seen near the Horn Tavern in Fleet
Street. Vivat Reginae (sic).'
   Of the miraculous accouchement of Margaret, Countess
of Heningberg, Thoresby says': 'After, walked to Gray's
Inn to Mr. Smith, who most courteously entertained me, and
gave me some inscriptions he had taken for me in his travels,
particularly that for the memorable Countess who had 365
children at a birth; he saw the two basins they were bap-
tized in.'
   Nor was this the only exhibition of the kind; there
was yet another similar show.  'The Effigies of his late
Majesty King William III. of Glorious Memory, is Curiously
done in Wax to the Life, Richly Drest in Coronation
Robes, standing by the Effigies of his late Royal Consort,
Queen Mary in the like Dress; likewise the late Duke of
Gloucester in his Garter Robes. Together with the Effigies
of several Persons of Quality and Others, all which are Alive,
or have been so of late Years, whereby the Spectators may
Judge of Likeness. They are to be seen every Day at Mr.
Goldsmith's in Green Court in the Old Jury.' 2 This is the
same artist who is spoken of in a newspaper paragraph. 'On
Wednesday last Mrs. Goldsmith, the famous Woman for Wax-
work, brought to Westminster Abbey the Effigies of that cele-
brated Beauty the late Duchess of Richmond, which is said
to be the richest Figure that ever was set up in King Henry's
Chapel.' 3
   'To be seen in Exeter Change in the Strand, as well in
Christmas and other Holidays, as at all other times, tho' the
Change be shut, only then you must go in at that end towards
Charing Cross.

Persons may have their Effigies made, or their deceas'd Friends
               on reasonable Terms.'
  The Westminster waxwork figures were then in a sadly
dilapidated condition. Brown says: 'As soon as we as-
cended half a Score Stone Steps in a dirty Cobweb hole, and
in old Worm eaten Presses, whose Doors flew open on our

approach; here stood Edward the Third, as they told us,
which was a broken piece of Waxwork, a batter'd Head, and
a Straw stuff'd Body, not one quarter cover'd with Rags; his
beautiful Queen stood by, not better in Repair; and so to the
number of half a score Kings and Queens, not near so good
figures as the King of the Beggars make, and all the begging
Crew would be ashamed of their Company. Their Rear was
brought up with good Queen Bess, with the Remnants of an
old dirty Ruff, and nothing to cover her Majesty's Naked-
ness.'
   One of the most popular exhibitions was the puppet
shows kept by Robert Powell, a dwarf-
ish deformity. 'This is Mr. Powell-
That's he-the little Crooked Gentle-
man, that holds a Staff in his Hand,
without which he must fall.' 1 His
'Punch's Theatre' was in the little
Piazza, Covent Garden-and Steele
makes the under sexton of St. Paul's 2
Church grumble at his entertainment,
because it took people away from him.
Defoe says : ' Mr. Powell by Subscrip-
tions and full Houses, has gathered
such Wealth as is ten times sufficient
to buy all the Poets in England; that
he seldom goes out without his Chair,
and thrives on this incredible Folly
to that degree, that, were he a Freeman, he might hope
that some future Puppet Show might celebrate his being
Lord Mayor, as he has done Sir R. Whittington.' 3 Both in
the Tatler and Spectator he is frequently referred to, especi-
ally in the former. In the season he took himself and his
puppets to Bath, so that he always kept them employed.
   His performances were very varied, one being 'The
History of King Bladud, Founder of the Bath. The Figures
being drest after the manner of the Ancient Britains. With
the Walks, Groves, and Representation of the King's Bath
           1 Introduction to A Second Tale of a Tub, ed. 1715.

and new Pump house. The Figures of Ladies and Gentle-
men all moving in real Water.' He caught the passing folly
as it flew, and depicted it as in 'The City Rake or Punch
turn'd Quaker,' 'Poor Robins Dream or the Vices of the Age
Exposed;' or, he had a puppet 'of a Rope Dancer, being an
exact Pattern of the present Lady Isabella.' He was for ever
bringing out some novelty, even if it was such rubbish as 'a
New Piece of Machinary after the British Manner, contrived
and just finished by Powell, which represents a Paradice
wonderful surprising. At the breaking of the clouds arise
several Triumphal Arches, which form several most agreeable
Prospects; beautify'd by her most Serene Majesty of Great
Britain in her Royal Robes, attended by her Peers and
Officers of State; under their Feet are represented the
Trophies taken from the French and Bavarians by her
Majesty's Arms this War.'
   One of the last of Powell's advertisements, in Queen Anne's
reign, was: 'Whereas it has been reported that Punch of the
Bath and Covent Garden was dead, these are to inform the
Publick that he was only in a small consumption, but by the
long experienc'd Cordial of the Golden Elixir is recovered,
and remov'd for the Air to the Great Masquerading House in
Spring Garden, where he hopes once more to see his noble
Benefactors.'
   Pinkethman was far too keen to let Powell have the
monopoly of this sort of entertainment, so we find a hand-
bill: 'This is to give Notice, that Mr. PENKETHMAN, who,
by his Indefatigable Industry, has ever made it his Study
to Invent Something New and Excellent to please the
World, has, with the Greatest Diligence, Labour and Ex-
pence, set himself to contrive, which he has now, after
Several Years Application, brought to Perfection, a most
Surprising and Magnificent Machine, call'd the PANTHEON,
consisting of several Curious Pictures, and Moving Figures,
representing the Fabulous History of the HEATHEN GODS.
   'The Whole contains Fourteen several Entertainments,
and near a Hundred Figures (besides Ships, Beasts, Fowl,
and other Embellishments) some near a Foot in Height; all
which have their respective and peculiar Motions, their very

Heads, Legs, and Arms, Hands and Fingers, Artificially
moving exactly to what they perform, and setting one Foot
before another, as they go, like Living Creatures, in such a
Manner that Nothing but Nature itself can exceed it. In
short, the PAINTING is by the Finest Hands, and the Story
and Contrivance so Admirable, that it justly deserves to be
esteemed One of the Greatest Wonders of the Age.' This
show is casually mentioned in Spectator (No. 31).
   Pinkethman was also proprietor of a moving picture, for
in an advertisements 1 he says: 'Mr. Pinkethman In order to
divert and oblige the Gentry and others of Greenwich, Dept-
ford, Woolwich, Lee, and other adjacent places thereabouts,
has remov'd the most Famous Artificial and Wonderful
Moving Picture that came from Germany, and was to be
seen at the Duke of Marlborough's Head in Fleet Street, is
now to be seen at the Hospital Tavern in Greenwich,' etc.
Thoresby 2 saw this picture when in London in 1709, and was
highly delighted with it. He also says: 'I had some dis-
course with the German inventor of it, Mr. Jacobus Morian.'
The following is its handbill:-
         ' To All Gentlemen, Ladies and others
Notice is hereby given, that here is arrived from Germany, a
most artificial and Wonderful Original Picture, the like never
seen in all Europe: Part of this fine Picture represents a
Landskip, and the other part the Water on Sea: In the
Landskip you see a Town, out of the Gates of which cometh
a Coach Riding over a Bridge through the Country, behind,
before, and between the Trees till out of sight; coming on the
Bridge, a Gentleman sitting on the Coach, civilly salutes the
Spectating Company, the turning of the Wheels and motion
of the Horses are plainly seen as if natural and Alive. There
Cometh also from the Town Gate a Hunter on Horseback,
with his Doggs behind him, and his Horn at his side, coming
to the Bridge he taketh up his Horn and Blows it that it is
distinctly heard by all the Spectators. Another Hunter
painted as if Sleeping, and by the said Blowing of the Horn
awaking, riseth up his Head, looks about, and then lays

down his Head again to Sleep, to the great Amazement and
Diversion of the Company. There are also Painted and
Represented, Country men and Women, Travellers, Cows and
Pack horses going along the Road till out of sight. And
at a seeming distance on the Hills are several Windmills con-
tinually Turning and Working. From a River or Sea port,
you see several sorts of Ships and Vessels putting to Sea,
which Ships by degrees lessen to the sight as they seem to
Sail further off. Many more Varieties too long to be in-
serted here, are Painted and Represented in this Picture to
the greatest Admiration, Diversion and Satisfaction of all
Ingenious Spectators. The Artist Master of this Piece hath
employed above 5 years in contriving, making and per-
fecting it. It was design'd for a present to a great Prince
in Germany, to be put in his chiefest Cabinet of greatest
Rarities, but that Prince Dying, the maker kept it to him-
self, and now presents it to the View and Diversion of
all ingenious Persons.' This picture is just noticed in the
Tatler (No. 129): 'and I doubt not but it will give as good
content as the moving picture in Fleet Street.'
   There was another of these mechanical toys, exhibited at
the same place. 'Far exceeding the Original formerly shewn,
and never publish'd before the beginning of the present Year
171O. Representing several stately ships and vessels sailing
out of the Port of a City; a Coach, drawn by four Horses
going over a bridge into the Town; a Cart with an Old
Woman in it, drawn by two Horses, the Wheels moving: A
Gentleman carry'd in a Chair, saluting the Company, A
Windmill continually turning round; Swans swimming,
which dip their Heads in the Water: A Man digging with
a Pick Ax: All in lively Motion,' etc. And still one more
appeared in 1713, which was a representation of the sky
effects of morning, moon, and night, with ships sailing, and
saluting the forts as they passed.
   At the Duke of Marlborough's Head, too, was to be seen
'a true and very natural Representation of the most famous
Antiquities and Stupendious Works commonly called the
Seven Miracles of the World; All which cannot but be
pleasant to the Eyes of all curious Beholders, and perhaps

more agreeable than may by Words be expressed,' but there
is no record of what this exhibition was like.
   'In Bell Yard, over against the Middle Temple Gate,
Fleet Street, next door to the Bell Inn, at the Arms of
Amsterdam, will be shewn for the satisfaction of all persons
of Quality and others, most Curious and exact Model of
the famous City of Amsterdam, being between 20 and 30
foot long, and near 20 foot broad; with all the Churches,
Chappels, Stadt house, Hospitals, noble Buildings, Streets,
Trees, Walks, Avenues, with the Sea, Shipping, Sluices,
Rivers, Canals, &amp;c., most exactly built to admiration; In
short, the Situation and Representation of the whole City is
performed with such Art and Ingenuity, to the wonderful
satisfaction of the States General of the United Provinces,
several Foreign Princes, our Nobility, Gentry, Artificers and
others, that have seen it, that it is allowed to be one of the
greatest curiosities ever yet seen in England. This great
piece of Work was 12 years in finishing, and cost a vast sum
of Money.'
   It is always interesting to watch glass-blowers at work,
and see them turn out their pretty but fragile toys; and
doubtless they yielded as much, or more, delight in Anne's
time.
             'By Her Majesties Authority.
This is to give Notice to all Gentlemen, Ladies, and Others,
That there is lately arriv'd in this Place, a Rare and Curious

bloweth of all Colours in Glass, so curiously, the like was
never seen in this Kingdom.

too tedious to Mention.
   'There is a Wheel that's turn'd by Humane power, which
Spins Ten Thousand Yards of Glass in less than half an

   'He also maketh Artificial Eyes of Glass to admiration,

Bottles and Ladles, with pipes to smoke Tobacco, and Grena-
does to stick by the Snuff of a candle that gives a report like
a Gun; blows Tea Pots and other fancies imitating China.'
   A singular mechanical toy, too, deserves special men-
tion: ' At the Black Horse in Hosier Lane, near West
Smithfield is to be seen a large piece of Water Work, 12
Foot long and 9 foot high, with a new Mathematical Foun-
tain 8 foot high, made in white flint glass, in which is a

   But the man who did most with hydraulic power was
Winstanley, the builder of the fantastic, semi-Chinese pagoda
lighthouse on the Eddystone rock. Winstanley had been

he constructed ingenious but useless hydraulic toys, and,
from being locally famous, he opened an exhibition of them
in London.
   The first mention I can find of it in this reign, is in the
Postman, May 1/4, 1703: 'Mr. Henry Winstanley's Water
Works, will be Opened on Thursday being the 6th of May;
And All Persons that please to see them, are desired to be
there between 3 and 4 of the Clock. The House is at the
lower end of Pickadilly, towards Hide Park.' In the Daily
Courant, August 14, 1703, he notifies that: 'Mr. Henry
Winstanley's Water Works being now open'd, and several
Persons coming too late, by reason of the days being shorter,
this is to satisfie and give notice, that they will be shewn
from Monday next at Four of the Clock. And therefore
all Persons that are disposed to see them, are desired to be
there before the time, or exactly at it. And also this is
further to acquaint, that they will not be shewn this Season
longer than 10 or 14 days, by reason of Mr. Winstanly's
having extraordinary Occasions of going out of Town.'
   It was a disastrous 'out of town' for him, for he had his
wish gratified in being in his gimcrack lighthouse 'in the
greatest storm ever known,' namely, that of November 27,
1703, which clean swept away the building, Winstanley, and
five other persons.
   For some years after his sad death his exhibition was in
abeyance, until we see by the Daily Courant, June 5, 1707:
' The famous Water Works of the late Ingenious Mr. Henry
Winstanley are now open'd, and will continue to be shown
this present June, and the ensuing Month of July (for the
Benefit of his Widow) by his old Servants, with several
Additions. And all Persons that please to see them, are
desir'd to be at the House by 5 of the clock at the farthest,
and they will not lose time in staying. The House is at the
lower End of Picadilly towards Hide Park, and is known by
the Wind Mill on the top of it. As also his famous House
at Littlebury in Essex is kept up, and shewn as formerly,
with several additions.' His widow continued to show them,
with many variations, every summer during the remainder of
the reign. In 1711 there were shown 'Sea Gods and God-

desses, Nymphs, Mermaids, and Satirs, all of them playing
of water as suitable, and some Fire mingling with the water,
and Sea Triumphs round the Barrel that plays so many
Liquors; all which is taken away after it had perform'd its
part, and the Barrel is broke in Pieces before the Spectators.'
In 1712 there is the same entertainment, but fuller details
are given: it was 'of 6 several sorts of Wine, and the best
brandy and biskets, all coming out of the famous Barrel, and
given to the Boxes and Pit; with Geneva, Cherry beer, and
Cyder to the first Gallery, there is also Coffee and Tea as at
all other times.'
   In 1713 'the Curious Barril will be made a Spring
Garden, entertaining the Boxes and Pit with Cool Tankards,
Spaw Waters, Bisquits, Milk, Ale, Beer, Sullibubs, Cake, and
Cheese Cakes, and Flowers playing of Water: And a very
delightful part will be added to the 3 Parts that are usually
performed. There is Galuthetis's Flight from Polyheme, and
as she is carried in State by Neptune attended by many
Figures playing of Water, and some with Fire mingling with
it; then will be a great Tempest of Thunder and Lightning
and burning Flames rolling in great Cascades of Water,
to the Expence of 300 Tun extraordinary.' In 1714, 'the
Curious Barrel will be made a Dairy House, entertaining the
Boxes and Pit with Curds, several sorts of Creams, Milk,
Whey, Cakes, Cheese Cakes, Sullibubs, New Butter, Butter
Milk, which a Woman will be seen to churn, and a flying
Zepherus, a Flora presenting the Spectators with a Basket of
Fruit ... There is Galathea's flight from Polypheme guided
by two flying Boys, with a flaming Torch playing Water
through the Flames: A flying fiery Dragon, out of whose
Mouth comes great Fire Balls, flames of Fire, a large sheet of
Water, with many Cascades of Water, to the expence of 800
Tuns extraordinary.' It was a very popular exhibition, and
ranked, as we see,1 with the opera and the play.
   In I710 the good folks of London were treated to a
somewhat unusual spectacle-that of four real live Indian
chiefs, or kings, as they were called. They came over in April
of that year, and were treated as guests of the nation; apart-

BUT all amusements at this time were not so innocent as
the foregoing: there were fiercer and more blood-stirring
excitements for the men. Take bear and bull baiting. The
former was dying out, and was no longer as popular as it
was during the reigns of Elizabeth, James I., and Charles I.

not?
   Anne. Ay, indeed, Sir.

women, indeed, cannot abide 'em; they are very ill-favoured rough

    Indeed, in 1709, Christopher Preston, of Hockley-in-the-
Hole, was attacked and partially devoured by one of his own
bears. His funeral sermon was preached by the Rev. Dr.
Pead, then incumbent of St. James's, Clerkenwell.
   The animals destined for combat were paraded through
the streets, as we learn from Gay ('Trivia,' Book 2).

   That these places of so-called sport were disorderly need
not be said; indeed, to 'make a place a bear-garden' is
proverbial. The rough element wanted some safe outlet for
its energy, and found it in such exhibitions. Nor must we
be too hasty to decry them when we recollect that it was only
in 1835 that it absolutely became illegal to keep any house,
pit, or other place for baiting or fighting any bull, bear, dog,
or other animal. We have our dog-fights now-prize-
fighting is not yet extinct, many a quiet main of cocks is
fought, many a rat-pit exists, and badger-drawing is not
altogether an unknown thing.
   There were three bear-gardens-at Hockley-in-the-Hole
(Clerkenwell), at Marrybone Fields (at the back of Soho
Square), and at Tuttle (Tothill) Fields, Westminster, and at
all these baiting was carried on. Of the latter we find an
advertisement promising plenty of sport:    ' At William
Wells's Bear Garden, in Tuttle Fields, Westminster, this
present Monday the 10th of April, will be a Green Bull
Baited; and 20 Doggs fights for a Coller, and that Dogg that
runs farthest and fairest wins the Coller; with other Diver-
sion of Bull Baiting and Bear Baiting.'

   'Here follows the Manner of those Bull Baitings which
are so much talk'd of: They tie a Rope to the Root of the
Horns of the Ox or Bull, and fasten the other End of the
Cord to an Iron Ring fix'd to a Stake driven into the
Ground; so that this Cord being about 15 Foot long, the
Bull is confin'd to a Sphere of about 30 Foot Diameter.
Several Butchers, or other Gentlemen, that are desirous to
exercise their Dogs, stand round about, each holding his
own by the Ears; and when the Sport begins, they let loose
one of the Dogs: The Dog runs at the Bull: the Bull im-
movable, looks down upon the Dog with an Eye of Scorn,
and only turns a Horn to him to hinder him from coming
near: The Dog is not daunted at this, he runs round him,
and tries to get beneath his Belly, in order to seize him by
the Muzzle, or the Dewlap, or the pendant Glands: The Bull
then puts himself into a Posture of Defence; he beats the
Ground with his Feet, which he joins together as close as
possible, and his chief Aim is not to gore the Dog with the
Point of his Horn,2 but to slide one of them under the Dog's
Belly (who creeps close to the Ground to hinder it) and to
throw him so high in the Air that he may break his Neck in
the Fall. This often happens: When the Dog thinks he is
sure of fixing his Teeth, a Turn of the Horn, which seems to
be done with all the Negligence in the World, gives him a
Sprawl thirty Foot high, and puts him in danger of a damnable
Squelch when he comes down. This Danger would be un-
avoidable, if the Dog's Friends were not ready beneath him,
some with their Backs to give him a soft Reception, and
others with long Poles which they offer him slant ways, to
the Intent that, sliding down them, it may break the Force
of his Fall. Notwithstanding all this care, a Toss gener-
ally makes him sing to a very scurvy Tune, and draw his
Phiz into a pitiful Grimace: But, unless he is totally
stunn'd with the Fall, he is sure to crawl again towards the
Bull, with his old Antipathy, come on't what will. Some-
times a second Frisk into the Air disables him for ever from
playing his old Tricks; But, sometimes, too, he fastens upon
     These dogs were only a moderate size.

his Enemy, and when once he has seiz'd him with his Eye
teeth, he sticks to him like a Leech, and would sooner die
than leave his Hold. Then the Bull bellows, and bounds,
and Kicks about to shake off the Dog; by his Leaping the
Dog seems to be no Manner of Weight to him, tho' in all
Appearance he puts him to great Pain. In the End, either
the Dog tears out the Piece he has laid Hold on, and falls, or
else remains fix'd to him, with an Obstinacy that would
never end, if they did not pull him off. To call him away
would be in vain; to give him a hundred blows would be as
much so; you might cut him to Pieces Joint by Joint before
he would let him loose. What is to be done then ? While
some hold the Bull, others thrust Staves into the Dog's
Mouth, and open it by main Force. This is the only Way
to part them.'
   This, however, was not always the case. Look at the
other side :-
              Curs'd dog, the bull reply'd, no more
              I wonder at thy thirst of gore;
              For thou (beneath a butcher train'd,
              Whose hands with cruelty are stain'd,
              His daily murders in thy view)
              Must, like thy tutor, blood pursue.
              Take then thy fate. With goring wound
              At once he lifts him from the ground:
              Aloft the sprawling hero flies,
              Mangled he falls, he howls, and dies.2

   Here is a refinement of cruelty: 'At the Bear Garden
in Hockley in the Hole, 171O. This is to give notice to all
Gentlemen, Gamsters, and Others, That on this present
Monday is a Match to be fought by two Dogs, one from
Newgate Market, against one of Honey Lane Market, at a
Bull, for a Guinea to be spent. Five Let goes out off
Hand, which goes fairest and farthest in Wins all; like wise
a Green Bull to be baited, which was never baited before,
and a Bull to be turned lose with Fire works all over him;
also a Mad Ass to be baited; With variety of Bull baiting
and Bear baiting; and a Dog to be drawn up with Fire
works.'3  These novelties took, for a subsequent advertise-

ment tells us that 'The Famous Bull of Fire works pleased
the Gentry to Admiration.' Indeed, it must have been
popular, for in an advertisement of the Tatler, Jan. 3/5, 1709
(1710), we find: 'This Day is published The Bull Baiting, or
Sach---ll  1 dressed up in Fire works; lately brought over
from the Bear Garden in Southwark, and exposed for the
Diversion of the Citizens of London: at 6d. a piece.' This
book, however, is very dreary fun.
   But bears and bulls, though baited, were never allowed to
be killed by their adversaries, which, however, was not the
case with cock-fighting, a pastime passionately indulged in
in this reign. There were many cock-pits-one historical one,
the Council Chamber at Whitehall, where in 1710 Guiscard
stabbed Harley with his penknife, and which went by the
name of the Cockpit certainly till 1810. There was 'The
Royal Cock Pit on the South Side of St. James Park,' where
mains used to be fought for such prizes as '4 Guineas a
Battel and 40 the odd Battel.' And there was a famous one
near Gray's Inn Walks, or Gardens, where dear Sir Roger
walked with the Spectator, and which Brown describes as
'The Lawyer's Garden of Contemplation, where I found (it
being early in the Morning) none but a parcel of Super-
annuated Debauchees, huddled up in Cloaks, Frize Coats and
Wadded Gowns, to preserve their old Carcases from the
searching sharpness of Hampstead Hair.'  There had been
one there previous to 1704, when we find 'At the New Cock
pit at the Bowling Green, behind Grays Inn Walks, this
present Tuesday being the 28th of March, will begin a great
Match of Cock fighting, for Ten Guineas a Battle, and Two
Hundred Guineas the odd Battle, between the Gentlemen of
Essex and Cambridgeshire, against the Gentlemen of London
and Surry.' In 1706 it was to let, and in 1708 it was burnt
down under sad circumstances. 'There had been a great
Match fought on Saturday, and the Weather being hard, two
of the Feeders, Crompton and Day, would stay all Night with
their Cocks; when by Negligence their Candle fell among
the Straw, which took Fire.  In the Morning one Mr.
Newberry, a great Cocker, sent his two Sons to see his

Cocks fed, who wonder'd they saw no Snow upon the Cock
pit; when coming thither they saw a great Smoak, and
before they cou'd make any Body hear, the place was all
on Fire.  One of the feeders was found burnt, only some
part of his Body remaining, and the other is missing.'1 It
was repaired and re-opened 1709, but was again to be re-let
in 1710. There were many others, even extending to the
suburbs, such as Hampstead.
   Misson's description of them is amusing, but it would
hardly appear from it that he ever witnessed a fight. ' Cock
fighting is one of the great English Diversions; they build
Amphitheatres for this Purpose, and Persons of Quality some-
times appear at them. Great Wagers are laid; but I'm told,
that a Man may be damnably bubbled, if he is not very sharp.'
   County matches used to be arranged; but for a spice of
arrogance little can beat this: 'At the New Cock Pit by the
Bowling Green behind Gray's Inn Walks, next Tuesday, will
begin a great Match of Cock Fighting which will continue all
the Week; the Gentlemen of Essex against all the rest of
Great Britain, for 10 Guineas a Battle and 500 Guineas the
Odd Battle.' These were the highest stakes ever publicly
advertised in Queen Anne's reign, whatever might have been
done at private matches-as, for instance, in the Tatler's Club
(Tatler, 132), Sir Jeoffrey Notch, their chairman, would talk
about his favourite old game-cock Gauntlett, 'upon whose
head, the Knight, in his youth, had won five hundred pounds,
and lost two Thousand.'
   The cocks sometimes fought in silver spurs, but generally
with steel ones, and of these there were several kinds. 'Note
that on Wednesday there will be a single battle fought with
Sickles, after the East India manner. And on Thursday
there will be a Battle Royal, one Cock with a Sickle, and 4
Cocks with fair Spurs. On Friday there will be a pair of
Shake bags fight for 5&pound;. And on Saturday there will be a
Battle Royal, between a Shakebag with fair Spurs, and 4
Matchable Cocks which are to fight with Sickles, Launcet
Spurs, and Penknife Spurs, the like never yet seen. For the
Entertainment of the foreign Ambassadors and Gentlemen.'

    Cock-fighting even had a literature of its own. In 1709
was published 'The Royal Pastime of Cock fighting &amp;c. by
R. H. a Lover of the Sport'; and in the same year was printed
another edition of 'The Compleat Gamesters, by C. Cotton,'
in which are full directions as to the breeding, feeding, and
fighting of cocks. As so little is now known of this cruel
sport, a few short extracts from this latter work will make us
more thoroughly comprehend it as it was then practised.
    In shape, the cock must be neither too large nor too
small; with a small head and strong legs; his spurs, though
long and sharp, turning slightly inwards. He should walk
very upright and stately; and if he crows frequently in his
pen it is a sign of courage. The combs or wattles are to be
cut as soon as they appear; and the cock chickens are to be
separated as soon as they begin to peck each other. Fighting
cocks should not begin their career as such until they are
two years old; and before a battle they should be dieted-i.e.
for four days they should be fed with stale bread three times
a day; after which they may have a spar, or sham fight, with
another cock, their spurs being carefully guarded with leather
balls. They must then be stoved, which meant putting them
in deep baskets filled with straw, covering them with straw
and shutting down the lids; but before undergoing this
' sudatorium' they were to be fed with sugar candy, chopped
rosemary, and butter. In the evening the cock was released,
and fed with wheat meal and oatmeal, ale, white of eggs, and
butter. 'The second day after his sparring, take your Cock
into a fair green Close, and having a Dunghill Cock in your
arms, show it him, and then run from him, that thereby you
may entice him to follow, you permitting him to have now
and then a blow; when he begins to pant, being well heated,
take him up and carry him home.' He was then to have a
dose of pounded leaves of herb of grace, hyssop, and rose-
mary, mixed with butter, and then stoved till the evening.
Next day he was to rest, and the day after to be sparred,
which treatment was to be continued for a fortnight; but for
the next month, by which time he was to be fit for fighting,
he was merely to be fed and stoved. He was not to be fed
before fighting.

THE horse, necessarily, in those days, when locomotion was
only obtainable through its agency, was of prime importance:
farriery was fairly understood, and some voluminous dis-
quisitions on it were published, with most curious receipts
for the various ills horseflesh is heir to, and elaborate engrav-
ing of fleams, firing irons, bits (some of them very cruel),
and all sorts of harness-even down to curry-combs, dandy-
brushes, and stable utensils. But it is not here that the
hack or roadster is to be spoken of, but the horse kept for
sport-the race horse-about which they had already found
out the fact,' Like Race Horses cost more in keeping them
than they're worth.' 1 The Queen was fond of racing, and
gave her 100&pound;. gold cups to be run for, as now: nay more,
she not only kept race horses, but ran them in her own name.
Her six-year-old grey gelding Pepper ran for her gold cup at
York (over Clifton and Rawcliffe Ings) on July 28, 1712.
Over the same course, and for the same stake, on August 3,
1714, ran her grey horse Mustard, by the Taffolet Barb,
which, according to the Daily Courant of May 14, 1714, was
entered to run 'in Whitsun week at Guildford in Surrey for
the 50&pound;. plate'; and, sad to tell, her brown horse Star (after-
wards called Jacob) ran at York for a plate of the value of

14&pound;., and won it, on July 30, 1714, the very day on which the
Queen was struck with apoplexy, expiring the next day.
    She paid a visit to Newmarket in April 1705, going to
Cambridge once or twice during her stay. Luttrell says:
'Aprill 26, 1705. The queen has ordered her house at New-
market to be rebuilt, and gave 1000&pound;. towards paving the
town; and bought a running horse of Mr. Holloway, which
cost a 1000 guineas, and gave it to the prince.' Prince
George shared his august consort's love of horse-racing, and
in the Gazette, June 18/21, 1705, we find: 'These are to give
notice, That his Royal Highness the Prince is pleased to give
a Gold Plate, value One Hundred Guineas to be run for
at Black Hambleton in Yorkshire, over the four Miles old
Beacon course, the last Thursday in July, by any Horse five
years old last Foaling time: No Horse to be admitted to
run but such as bring a Certificate from the Breeder of his
Horses Age; and likewise to be judged and approved to be
no older than aforesaid, by the Gentlemen whose Horses run
for the said Plate; each horse to carry ten Stone weight,
and start at the usual hours.
   'And his Royal Highness is also pleased to give another
Gold Plate, Value One Hundred Guineas, to be run for the
second Thursday in October next, one Heat, over the Heat's
Course at Newmarket, ten Stone, by Horses five years old,
whose Age must be certified as aforesaid, and likewise allowed
by Gentlemen whose Horses run. This year no Mare will
be admitted to run for either of those Plates: Although for
the future his Royal Highness designs to give a Plate of the
like Value, to be run for at each of the aforesaid Courses by
Mares only, of the said Age.'
   Indeed, in that year of 1705 the royal couple seemed
mightily given to racing, for 'the queen has appointed
horse races to be at Datchet after her return from Winchester
to Windsor.'
   Her gold plates, as far as can be made out from news-
paper advertisements, were, in 1703, 100&pound;., at Stapleton Leys,
Yorkshire, September 2; one at Newmarket on April 12,
1705; at Langton Wold, near Malton, Yorkshire, July 24,

1707: in 1709 at Black Hambleton, Yorkshire, July 26;
one of 50&pound;. at Datchet, August 24; one of 100&pound;. at New-
market, October 6; while the Prince's Cup of 100&pound;. for
mares four years old was run for on October 8 the same
year; in 1711, at Clifton and Rawncliffe Ings; in 1712 at
Black Hambleton, on July 26; and at Clifton Ings, on
July 28; in 1713 at Hambleton, August 1 ; Clifton, August 3;
and in the same year one was run for at Ascot Heath
on August 12-the first mention that I can find of racing
there ; in 1714, Clifton Ings, on July 28.
   A few racing mems of this time will illustrate to what an
extent this passion for the turf was carried. I702: 'They
write from Newmarket, That the Lord Godolphin's and
Mr. Harvy's Horses ran for 3,000&pound;. His Lordship won; As
also the Earl of Argile, and the Duke of Devonshire's;
the latter's Horse won, by which Mr. Pheasant got a con-
siderable sum.' 1703 : ' The great horse race at Newmarket,
run for 1000 guineas between the lord Treasurer and the
Duke of Argyle, was won by the latter.' Perhaps the earliest
sporting paper is 'News from New Market: or An Account
of the Horses Match'd to Run there in March, April, and
May 1704, The Weight, Miles, Wages and Forfeits. Printed
for John Nutt near Stationer's Hall. Price 2d.' 1707: ' Last
Monday was a horse race at Newmarket, between the lord
Granby's Grantham and Mr. Young's Blundel, for 3000&pound;.-
the latter won.' On April 10, 1708, at Newmarket, the Duke
of Bedford's bay horse (9 stone) had a match with Mr.
Minchall's bay colt (8 1/2 stone) for 1,000 guineas; but there
is no record of which won. These were the highest stakes
recorded during the reign: they were generally for 200 or
300 guineas.
    Luttrell records a somewhat singular match against time:
'14 April 1709. Some days since, a baker at Clerkenwell
Green, laid with a Vintner there, a wager of 400 guineas
against 16 Guineas, that his horse could not run from Shore-
ditch Church to Ware and back again (being 40 miles) in
2 hours and 36 minutes, which race was last Tuesday, and
performed in 2 hours and 28 minutes, but the horse since
dead.'

   The first mention, in this reign, of Epsom Races, as far
as I can find, is in the London Gazette April and May 26/3,
1703, when three small plates were to be run for, of 30&pound;., 10&pound;.,
and 5&pound;. value. On May 25, 1704, there was only one to be
competed for, and that of 20&pound;. They had very early ' Epsom
Spring Meetings'; for, in the Daily Courant, February 15,
1709, it says: 'On Epsom Downes in Surrey, on the first
Monday after the Frost, a Plate of 20l. will be run for,' etc.
   Races for stakes of little value were common all over the
country, and were deemed of sufficient importance to be
advertised in the London papers. Take a few haphazard:
Nottingham, Kerfall, Boston, Winchester, Croydon, Coventry,
Quainton, Horsham, Woodstock, Mansfield; nay, there was
even a 'Jockey Field betwixt Bedford Row and Gray's Inn,
having a full Prospect of Hampstead and Highgate.'
   What a vast difference there was between those old race-
courses and ours! No grand stands, no howling ring, no
carriages, no ladies; not even a special dress for the jockeys.
According to a nearly contemporary print, there were very
few spectators even-and but a sorry booth, or so, for the sale
of liquor.
   The most famous sporting man of his time was Tregonwell
Frampton, Esq., of Moreton, Dorsetshire, 'the Father of the
Turf,' who was keeper of her Majesty's running horses at
Newmarket-a post he had filled in the time of William III.,
and which he continued to hold under Georges I. and II. He
is described as being'the oldest, and as they say the cunningest
jockey in England; one day. he lost 1,000 gs., the next he
won 2,000, and so alternately. He made as light of throwing
away 500l. or 1,000l. at a time, as other men do of their
pocket money, and was perfectly calm, cheerful and uncon-
cerned when he lost a thousand pounds as when he won it.'
This may be true, but I find no record of his running for any
such large sums in any match. 'April 6, 1708. Mr. Framp-
ton's Monkey and Mr. Cotton's Snap, 100 Guineas. Ap. 27.
Sir Cecil Bishop's Quaker and Mr. Frampton's Monkey 200
guineas. Ap. 28. Mr. Minchall's Cork and Mr. Frampton's
Trumpeter 500 guineas. Oct. I, 1709. Mr. Pullen's Slouch
against Mr. Frampton's White Neck 200 g's. 5 Oct. Mr.





HORSE-RACING, HUNTING, SHOOTING, ETC.  307



Frampton's Teller against L'd Dorchester's Colt, 200 g's.' And
even his sporting bid in Sept. 1713 was not for high stakes,
although he challenged dukes to compete. 'Mr. Frampton
that keeps the Queen's Running Horses, has made a Sporting
Proposal to three Dukes, allowing them to joyn their Stables,
and Name to him any 6 Horses or Mares (the Horse called
Wyndham 1 excepted) against 6 of his now in his Stables ...
they are to run for 100&pound;. each horse,' etc.
   Thus we see he owned many horses, but the most famous
of all was one named Dragon, to whom it is alleged Frampton
behaved with cruel barbarity. On Oct. 30, 1712, Dragon ran
against Lord Dorchester's Wanton for three hundred guineas,
and on April 22, 1713, encountered the redoubtable Wyndham
for the same stakes. His alleged mutilation and death are
told by Dr. John Hawkesworth in No. 37 of The Adventurer.
There is no record of his death, but in an old song, called
'Newmarket Horse Race,' belonging to the early part of
George the First's reign, it says-
         For I'll have the brown Bay, if the blew bonnet ride,
         And hold a thousand Pounds of his side, Sir;
         Dragon would scow'r it, but Dragon Grows old;
         He cannot endure it, he cannot, he wonnot now run it,
           As lately he could:
         Age, age, does hinder the Speed, Sir,

which would infer that Dragon was old and worthless as a
racer before his death, and the other story falls to the
ground.
   When young, the Queen was very fond of hunting, and,
in fact, pursued it after her accession to the throne, when,
from her increasing size, she no longer mounted the saddle.
'The Queen came last Thursday to Hampton Court, and
having assisted in council, and dined there, returned at night
to Windsor, where she takes the divertisement of hunting
almost every day in an open Calash in the forest,'2 i.e. she
drove down the long rides and saw what she could of the
hunt. Again,3 three years later: 'This morning her Majestie
and the prince went for Winchester to take the diversion
               1 Belonging to the Duke of Somerset.

of hunting.' Still later 1: 'The queen was hunting the stag
till four this afternoon, and she drove in her chaise, above
forty miles.'
   The country gentry then, as now, were ardently fond of
sport; but then the hunting field was a thoroughly neigh-
bourly gathering, there were no subscription packs, and no
fast trains to bring every snob that possesses, or can hire, a
'hunter.' The runs might not be so fast as now, nor were
they ever recorded in any sporting paper-horrible dis-
advantages, doubtless, but still they brought neighbours
together, engendered a kindly feeling, and gave legitimate
occupation to people whose brains were not addled with too
much reading. Where can there be a prettier picture of
a thoroughbred old English sportsman than that which
Addison draws of Sir Roger2: 'The Walls of his great
Hall are covered with the Horns of several kinds of Deer
that he has killed in the Chace, which he thinks the most
valuable Furniture of his House, as they afford him frequent
Topicks of Discourse, and shew that he has not been Idle.
At the lower End of the Hall, is a large Otter's Skin stuffed
with Hay, which his Mother ordered to be hung up in that
manner, and the Knight looks upon it with great Satisfaction,
because it seems he was but nine Years old when his Dog
killed him. A little Room adjoining to the Hall is a kind
of Arsenal filled with Guns of several Sizes and Inventions,
with which the Knight has made great Havock in the Woods,
and distroyed many thousands of Pheasants, Partridges, and
Woodcocks. His Stable Doors are patched with Noses that
belonged to Foxes of the Knights own hunting down. Sir
Roger shewed me one of them that for Distinction Sake has
a Brass Nail struck through it, which cost him about fifteen
Hours riding, carried him through half a dozen Counties,
killed him a Brace of Geldings, and lost above half his Dogs.
This the Knight looks upon as one of the greatest Exploits
of his Life. The perverse Widow, whom I have given some
Account of, was the Death of several Foxes; for Sir Roger
has told me that in the course of his Amours he patched
the Western Door of his Stable. Whenever the Widow was
               1 Stella.     2 Spectator, 115.






HORSE-RACING, HUNTING, SHOOTING, ETC. 309



cruel, the Foxes were sure to pay for it. In proportion as
his Passion for the Widow abated, and old Age came on,
he left off Fox hunting; but a Hare is not yet Safe that
Sits within ten Miles of his House.'
   Hunting commenced both earlier in the season and in the
day than now. 'It must be imagined it was near Day when
we went to Bed and therefore could not be expected we should
get out a Hunting at Five or Six in the Morning.'1 From a
set of nearly contemporary prints we gather that possibly
little attention was paid to earth-stopping, when fox-hunting,
for one part of the engraving shows a fox being dug out.
In another part the hounds are breaking up the fox, which
has not been denuded of his brush. Only the gentlemen
are represented as being on horseback, the huntsmen having
leaping poles. This was better for them than being mounted,
for the country was nothing like as cultivated as now, and
perfectly undrained, so that they could go straighter on foot,
and with these poles leaps could be taken that no horseman
would attempt.
           Nor should the Fox shun the pursuing Hound
           Nor the Tall Stag with branching Antlers crown'd.2

   From the engravings referred to, we find that the stag
was first found, or harboured, with a bloodhound-the stag-
hounds were coupled, and let loose when wanted by the
huntsmen, who were on foot. Its death was duly celebrated
by a ' Mort,' or blowing of horns, when a hunting knife was
presented to the principal man present, to cut off its head,
after everyone had passed his opinion as to his age, weight,
etc.: the deer was then carted home. Guns were carried
wherewith to shoot the stag, if necessary, when at bay.
   Budgell, in Spectator No. 117, well describes a run after
a hare, and the discipline of the hounds who were close upon
the hare, when the huntsman threw his pole between them-
this the well-tutored dogs would not pass, and the hare was
rescued. Gay, too, tells the story of a run well:-
           Now at a Fault the Dogs confus'dly stray,
           And try t'unravel his perplexing Way;

           They trace his artful Doubles o'er and o'er,
           Smell every Shrub, and all the Plain explore,
           'Till some stanch Hound summons the baffled Crew,
           And strikes away his wily Steps anew.
           Along the Fields they scow'r with jocund Voice,
           The frighted Hare starts at the distant Noise;
           New Stratagems and various Shifts he tries,
           Oft' he looks back, and dreads a close Surprize;
           Th' advancing Dogs still haunt his list'ning Ear,
           And ev'ry breeze augments his growing Fear:
           'Till tir'd at last, he pants, and heaves for Breath;
           Then lays him down, and waits approaching death.1

   Or what better description could we have of coursing a
hare than the following:-
         The Greyhound now pursues the tim'rous Hare,
         And shoots along the Plain with swift Career;
         While the sly Game escapes beneath his Paws,
         He snaps deceitful Air with empty Jaws;
         Enrag'd, upon his Foe he quickly gains,
         And with wide Stretches measures o'er the Plains;
         Again the Cunning Creature winds around,
         While the fleet Dog o'ershoots, and loses Ground;
         Now Speed he doubles to regain the Way,
         And crushes in his Jaws the Screaming Prey.
   Many packs of hounds were advertised for sale during
Anne's reign-not such large packs as we now           have, but
small packs, with which a man could then show sport, and yet
the keeping of which need not be costly. Two or three are
given for example's sake: 'Any Gentleman that hath a mind
to purchase a good pack of cloddy strong Hounds, fit for any
Country, from 15 couple to 10, may be accommodated,' etc.
'There are to be dispos'd of 18 Couple of Hare Hounds, well
siz'd and well mark'd, at reasonable rates.' 'There are 9
Couple of good Fox Hounds (with a Tarrier) (4 Couple being
stanch finders) to be sold at a very reasonable Price. These
Hounds are as proper for Deer as Fox.' 'Lost the 16th
Instant from the Earl of Litchfield's Foxhounds in some
Woods near Crawford in Kent, a small White Beagle, with
Red Spots on her Ears, and a short Tail, (being a Tarrier),
etc.
   There were cockney hunts, with deer, both at Hampstead

and Muswell Hill, and live deer were bought and sold com-
monly; indeed there is one advertisement which has a touch
of old Leadenhall Market about it. 'Any person who has
Beagles, Foxes or Hares to dispose of, may hear of a Pur-
chaser by giving Notice to the Porter at Sion Chappel near
Hamsted.'
   One sport then in vogue must not be omitted from the
list-otter-hunting.
          If you'd preserve a num'rous Finny Race,
          Let your fierce Dogs the Rav'nous Otter chase;
          Th' amphibious Creature ranges all the Shores,
          Shoots through the Waves, and ev'ry haunt explores:
          Or let the Gin his roving Steps betray,
          And save from hostile Jaws the Scaly Prey.

   Angling was extensively practised, with almost the same
appliances and tackle as now, even down to the wicker creel
at the side. Will Wimble 'makes a May fly to a Miracle;
and furnishes the whole country with angle rods.' Isaac
Walton had not long been dead (Dec. 15, 1683), and his
disciples in the 'Contemplative Man's     Recreation' were
many and experienced. Hear what Gay says about making
a fly to suit the water:-
         Oft' have I seen a skillful Angler try
         The various Colours of the treach'rous Fly;
         When he with fruitless Pain hath skim'd the Brook,
         And the coy Fish rejects the skipping Hook,
         He shakes the Boughs that on the Margin grow,
         Which o'er the Streams a waving Forrest throw;
         When if an Insect falls (his certain Guide)
         He gently takes him from the whirling Tide;
         Examines well his Form with Curious Eyes,
         His gaudy Colours, Wings, his Horns and Size,
         Then round his Hook a proper Fur he winds,
         And on the Back a speckled Feather binds.
         So just the Properties in ev'ry part,
         That even Nature's Hand revives in Art.

   Hawking, too, was a sport not then extinct, the land not
being so parcelled into fields, and fenced in, as now; so that
the flight of the birds could be easily followed. The birds
were startled by five or six spaniels trained to the work. Here






312    SOCIAL LIFE in the reign of QUEEN ANNE.



is a description of one lost by the Earl of Abingdon: 'a
small black and white Hawking Spaniel. his Hair not very
long, more black than white, long Back, with a thick Head.'
In brook hawking, men used to beat the rushes with poles,
and they also hawked partridges and pheasants. The latter
are depicted in the engraving as being poked off their roosts
with poles.
   They went bat-fowling with the same nets as are now
used, and they also netted partridges at night, with the aid
of a lanthorn. In wild-fowl shooting they also used a horse
for stalking. There were decoys for ducks, and we get an
insight as to how they were managed. ' These are to give
Notice, that if any Person that understands the management
of a Decoy, wants a place, he may have one about 40 Miles
from London provided he brings a Certificate from the last
Master he served as to his ability .... he shall have as good
Wages as is usually given, or a third Bird, as he shall agree
when he seeth the Decoy.'
   It was not every person that might shoot game: 'The
first of them, says he, that has a Spaniel by his Side, is a
Yeoman of about an hundred Pounds a Year, an honest
Man; He is just within the Game Act and qualified to kill
an Hare or a Pheasant; he knocks down a Dinner with his
Gun twice or thrice a Week; and by that means lives much
cheaper than those who have not so good an Estate as him-
self. He would be a good Neighbour if he did not destroy
so many Partridges; in short he is a very sensible man;
shoots flying; and has been several times foreman of the Petty
Jury.'  This game Act, which he was just within, was the
3rd James I. cap. 14, clause 5, which says that no one not
having forty pounds per annum, or 200&pound;. worth of goods and
chattels, may shoot game; and should they do so,' then any
person having lands, tenements or hereditaments, of the clear
yearly value of one hundred pounds a year, may take from
the person or possession of such malefactor or malefactors,
and to his own use for ever keep, such guns, bows, cross-
bows, &amp;c. &c,' and this Act was in force till 1827, when it
was repealed.

      HORSE-RACING, HUNTING, SHOOTING, ETC.                313

    Shooting flying was not an ordinary accomplishment: it
was but just coming in, and most people took 'pot shots,'
and would not risk shooting at a bird on the wing.
          The dreadful Sound the springing Pheasant hears
          Leaves his Close Haunt, and to some Tree repairs;
          The Dog, aloft the painted Fowl surveys,
          Observes his Motions, and at distance Bays.
          His noisie Foe the stooping Pheasant eyes,
          Fear binds his Feet, and useless Pinions ties,
          Till the sure Fowler, with a sudden Aim,
          From the tall Bough, precipitates the Game.

   Partridges, because they flew well, and strongly, were then
not shot, but snared, by means of a trained dog.

         Now the warm Scent assumes the Covey near,
         He treads with Caution, and he points with Fear.
         Then lest some Sentry Fowl his Fraud descry,
         And bid his Fellows from the Danger fly,
         Close to the Ground in Expectation lies,
         Till in the Snare the flutt'ring Covey rise.

   'But if I miss Sitting, I commonly hit 'em Flying,' says
Bellair in Mrs. Centlivre's 'Love at a Venture,' which shows
that it was only when the former failed, that he tried the
latter plan. And, in an advertisement for a gamekeeper, it
is noticed: ' Any one that is a very good Coach man, and
can Shoot flying, perfectly well, may hear of a good Place.'
If being a good coachman was useful to a gamekeeper, what
can we say to this: 'Any Gentleman that wants a Man for
Shooting, Hunting, Setting, or any Manner of Game, may
hear of one well qualified. He is a good Scholar, and shaves
well.'
   Luttrell notes, Mar.  5, 1707 : 'Yesterday the lords past
the bill for the preservation of the game, in which is a clause,
that if any poulterer, after the 1st of May next, sells hare,
pheasant, partridge &amp;c. shall forfeit 5&pound;. for every offence,
unless he has a certificate from the lord of the mannor that
they were not taken by poachers.' The killing of game must
have been earlier then than now, for, appended to Spectator
No. 156, Aug. 29, 1711, is the following: ' ADVERTISEMENT-

Mr. Spectator gives his most humble service to Mr. R. M. of
Chippenham in Wilts, and hath received the Partridges.'
   There were rifle matches in those day. One was shot at
the artillery ground, Finsbury, on July 16, 1703, for a cup
value twenty-five guineas: 'No gun to exceed 4 foot and a
half in the Barrel, the distance to be 200 yards, and but one
Shot a piece, the nearest the Centre to win.' On July 7,
1709, was a match for four pieces of plate: 'to stand 100
yards distance from the Target.' A deer, value 50s., was
to be shot for more than once-and the prize once sank as
low as 'a pair of breeches.' There was one very singular
prize: 'A very fine brass Gun, in the form of a Walking
Cane, to be us'd as a Gun or Pistol, and in it a fine Prospect
Glass, and a Perpetual Almanack engrav'd about the Head,
and a Sun Dial in the Head, and several other ingenious
Utensils.'
   Archery was still kept up, as we see by the following adver-
tisement 1: 'All Gentlemen who are Lovers of the Ancient
and Noble Exercise of Archery, are hereby Invited by the
Stewards of the Annual Feast for the Clerkenwell Archers, to
Dine with them at Mrs. Mary Barton's, at the Sign of Sir
John Oldcastle, upon Friday the 18th Day of July 1707 at
One of the Clock, and to pay the Bearer Thomas Beaumont,

IN those days, when everyone with any pretensions to gentility
wore a sword, and duelling was rife, it is no wonder that
exhibitions of skill in that weapon were favourites. Like
modern prize fights, they drew together all the scum and
riff-raff, as well as the gentry who were fond of so-called
sport.  They were disreputable affairs, and were decried
by every class of contemporary. The preliminaries were
swagger and bounce, as one or two out of a very large
number will show 1:-

A Tryal of Skill to be Performed between these two following
Masters of the Noble science of Defence, on Wednesday the
Fifth of April, 1710, at Three of the Clock precisely.
   'I, John Parkes from Coventry, Master of the Noble
Science of Defence, do Invite you Thomas Hesgate, to meet
me and Exercise at these following Weapons, viz:-
     Back Sword,                 Single Falchon,

   The challenger would wager some twenty or thirty
pounds, and the stakes would be deposited and delivered
to the challenged: the challenger receiving the money taken
at the door,2 or, as we should term it, gate money; which,
frequently, twice or thrice exceeded the value of the stakes.
   There is one remarkable exception, I have found, to this
monetary arrangement, but it is the only one in my ex-
perience. For, in an advertisement of the usual character,
there comes: 'Note. That John Stokes fights James Harris,
and Thomas Hesgate fights John Terriwest three Bouts each
at Back Sword, for Love.'

the combat duly advertised in at least one newspaper, and
the day arrived: like the bull and bear, the combatants
paraded the streets, preceded by a drum, having their sleeves
tucked up and their swords in hand. All authorities agree
that the fights were to a certain extent serious: 'The Edge
of the Sword was a little blunted, and the Care of the Prize
fighters was not so much to avoid wounding each other, as
to avoid doing it dangerously: Nevertheless, as they were
oblig'd to fight till some Blood was shed, without which no
Body would give a Farthing for the Show, they were some-
times forc'd to play a little ruffly. I once saw a much deeper
and longer Cut given than was intended.' 1
   Ward 2 gives a short description of one of these fights:
'Great Preparations at the Bear Garden all Morning, for the
noble Tryal of Skill that is to be play'd in the Afternoon.
Seats fill'd and crowded by Two. Drums beat, Dogs yelp,
Butchers and Foot soldiers clatter their Sticks; At last the
two heroes, in their fine borrow'd Holland Shirts, mount the
Stage about Three; Cut large Collops out of one another,
to divert the Mob and Make Work for the Surgeons: Smok-
ing, Swearing, Drinking, Thrusting, Justling, Elbowing,
Sweating, Kicking, Cuffing all the while the Company stays.'
   Steele gives a good account of a prize fight 3: 'The Com-
batants met in the Middle of the Stage, and shaking Hands,
as removing all malice, they retired with much Grace to the
Extremities of it; from whence they immediately faced about,
and approached each other, Miller with an Heart full of Reso-
lution, Buck with a watchful untroubled Countenance; Buck
regarding principally his own Defence, Miller chiefly thought-
ful of annoying his Opponent. It is not easie to describe
the many Escapes and imperceptible Defences between Two
Men of quick Eyes, and ready Limbs; but Miller's Heat laid
him open to the Rebuke of the calm Buck, by a large Cut on
the 'Forehead. Much Effusion of Blood covered his Eyes in
a Moment, and the Huzzas of the Crowd undoubtedly quick-
ened his Anguish. The Assembly was divided into Parties
upon their different ways of Fighting: while a poor Nymph

in one of the Galleries apparently suffered for Miller, and
burst into a Flood of Tears. As soon as his Wound was
wrapped up, he came on again in a little Rage, which still
disabled him further. But what brave Man can be wounded
with more Patience and Caution ? The next was a warm
eager Onset, which ended in a decisive Stroke on the Left Leg
of Miller. The Lady in the Gallery, during the second Strife,
covered her Face; and for my Part, I could not keep my
thoughts from being mostly employed on the Consideration
of her unhappy Circumstance that Moment, hearing the Clash
of Swords, and apprehending Life or Victory concerned her
Lover in every Blow, but not daring to satisfie herself on
whom they fell. The Wound was exposed to the View of
all who could delight in it, and sowed up on the Stage. The
surly Second of Miller declared at this Time, that he would
that Day Fortnight fight Mr. Buck at the Same Weapons,
declaring himself the Master of the renowned German; but
Buck denied him the Honour of that Courageous Disciple,
and asserting that he himself had taught that Champion
accepted the Challenge.'
   I have been, to my great regret, unable to find a con-
temporary print of one of these combats; the nearest
approach to it being the fight between Dr. Sacheverel and
Dr. Hoadley, which furnishes a graphic, though burlesque,
representation of the scene.
   Looking at the class from which these gladiators sprung,
it is not surprising to hear that some of these prize fights
were pre-arranged, or, to use modern slang, 'squared.' In
Spectator 449 is a letter, from which the following is an
extract: 'Being in a Box at an Alehouse, near that renowned
Seat of Honour above mentioned, 1 I overheard two Masters
of the Science agreeing to quarrel on the next Opportunity.
This was to happen in the Company of a Set of the Frater-
nity of Basket Hilts, who were to meet that Evening. When
this was settled, one asked the other, Will you give Cuts or
receive? the other answered, Receive. It was replied, Are
you a Passionate Man ? No, provided you cut no more nor
no deeper than we agree.'

  The very children were bitten with the mania.  'Appren-
tices, and all Boys of that Degree, are never without their
Cudgels, with which they fight something like the Fellows
before mention'd, only that the Cudgel is nothing but a stick;
and that a little Wicker Basket which covers the Handle of
the Stick, like the Guard of a Spanish Sword, serves the com-
batants instead of defensive Arms.'  1
   This sword-fighting, however, was seeing its last days,
and was, in the next reign, to be superseded by pugilistic
encounters. At present, boxing, although extensively prac-
tised, had not been reduced to a science. Whatever was it
made everybody so pugnacious ?  'Anything that looks
like fighting,' says Misson, 'is delicious to an Englishman.
If two little Boys quarrel in the Street, the Passengers stop,
make a Ring round them in a Moment, and set them against
one another, that they may come to Fisticuffs. When 'tis
come to a Fight, each pulls off his Neckcloth and his Waist-
coat, and give them to hold to some of the Standers by;
then they begin to brandish their Fists in the Air; the Blows
are aim'd all at the Face, they Kick one another's Shins, they
tug one another by the Hair &amp;c. He that has got the other
down may give him one Blow or two before he rises, but no
more; and let the Boy get up ever so often, the other is
obliged to box him again as often as he requires it. During
the Fight, the Ring of Bystanders encourage the Combatants
with great Delight of Heart, and never part them while they
fight according to the Rules. The Father and Mother of the
Boys let them fight on as well as the rest, and hearten him
that gives Ground or has the Worst.
   'These Combats are less frequent among grown Men than
Children, but they are not rare. If a Coachman has a Dis-
pute about his Fare with a Gentleman that has hired him,
and the Gentleman offers to fight him to decide the Quarrel,
the Coachman consents with all his Heart: The Gentleman
pulls off his Sword, lays it in some Shop, with his Cane,
Gloves and Cravat, and boxes in the same Manner as I have
describ'd above. If the Coachman is soundly drubb'd, which
happens almost always, that goes for payment; but if he is
                          1 Misson.

the Beator, the Beatee must pay the Money about which they
quarrelled. I once saw the late Duke of Grafton at Fisticuffs
in the open Street, with such a Fellow whom he lamb'd most
horribly.'
   There was cudgel playing-for a new       hat; 'he that
breaks most Heads to have the Hat; he that plays puts in
six-pence.' Quarterstaff was played, and there was a some-
what dangerous game-' there will be three bouts with
threshing flails.' ' A Tryal of Skill is to be fought &amp;c. be-
tween John Parkes of Coventry, and John Terrewest. Note
-They fight at the Ancient Weapon called the Threshing
Flail.'
   Mild athleticism seems to have obtained among a few
of the upper middle class: for instance, Addison speaks 2 of
the dumb-bell with which he used to practise every morning,
and also of a kind of Indian club exercise, 'brandishing of
two short Sticks grasped in each Hand, and loaden with
Plugs of Lead at either End. This opens the Chest, exer-
cises the Limbs, and gives a Man all the Pleasure of Boxing,
without the Blows.'
   There were foot races, but I can find but one or two
notices of them, and there is very little like professional
pedestrianism, except the following very mild feat: 'A
Wager of 100l. was laid last week, that a German of 64 years
old, should walk in Hyde Park 300 miles in 6 dayes, which
he did within the time, and a mile over.' 3
   Tennis was a fashionable game, although I only find one
public court mentioned, 'facing Oxenden Street near the
Haymarket.' Ward gets quite moral on the subject of this
game: 'Rightly considered, it's a good Emblem of the
World. As thus: the Gamesters are the Great Men, the
Rackets are the Laws, which they hold fast in their Hands,
and the Balls are we little Mortals which they bandy back-
wards or forwards from one to t'other as their own Wills and
Pleasure directs 'em.'
   John Parkes or Sparkes was buried at Coventry, and on his tombstone was
inscribed, inter alia, that he was a man of mild disposition, a gladiator by profes-
sion, who fought 350 battles in different parts of Europe, when he retired.
He died, 1733.

  Cricket was played, and sufficient interest was felt in the
matches: on one or two occasions they were advertised in
the newspapers. In 1705: 'This is to give notice, That a
Match at Cricket is to be plai'd between 11 Gentlemen of
the West part of the County of Kent against as many of
Chatham for 11 Guineas a man, at Mauldon in Kent on the
7th of August next.' And in 1707: 'There will be two
great Matches at Cricket plaid, between London and
Croydon; the first at Croydon on Tuesday July 1, and the
other to be plaid in Lamb's Conduit Fields near Holborn, on
the Thursday following, being the 3rd of July.'
   On the approach of winter football came into vogue, and
it was played in the streets.
                                 When lo ! from far
           I spy the furies of the Foot ball war:
           The 'prentice quits his Shop, to join the Crew,
           Increasing Crowds the flying Game pursue,
           Thus, as you roll the Ball o'er Snowy Ground,
           The gathering Globe augments with every Round.
           But whither shall I run? the Throng draws nigh,
           The Ball now skims the Street, now soars on High;
           The dext'rous Glazier strong returns the bound,
           And jingling sashes on the Penthouse sound. l

   'In Winter Foot-balls is a useful and charming Exercise.
It is a Leather Ball about as big as ones Head, fill'd with
Wind: This is kick'd about from one to t'other in the Streets,
by him that can get at it, and this is all the Art of it.' 2
    Skating, although practised here in the time of Fitz-
Stephen, had fallen into desuetude, until it was reintroduced
by the Cavaliers who had been with Charles II. in Holland.
Pepys thought it was 'a very pretty art,' yet got very nervous
over the Duke of York's skating. ' To the Duke, and fol-
lowed him into the Parke, where, though the ice was broken
and dangerous, yet he would go slide upon his scates, which
I did not like, but he slides very well.' Skating was popular
in London in Anne's reign, but it is doubtful whether it
obtained in the remote parts of the country. Writes Swift
to Stella, Jan. 31, 1711: 'The Canal and Rosamonds Pond

         1 Trivia, book 2.               2 Misson.

full of the rabble sliding, and with skates, if you know what
those are.'
    'The Gentile, cleanly and most ingenious Game at
Billiards' was a resource at home; and it was played on a
table like ours-an oblong wooden table, covered with green
cloth, and with pockets of netting, in precisely the same
position as now, the cushions being stuffed with fine flax or
cotton. The game was not played as we play it, but there
were two balls, a port or archway at one end, and a king or
cone at the other. The cues were not like ours, but more
like maces, only much heavier.  Your Sticks ought to be
heavy, made of Brazile Lignum Vitae, or some other weighty
                       wood which at the broad end must be
                       tipt with Ivory.' The game was not
                       only played in private, but in coffee,
                       houses. 'At the Greyhound Coffee
                       House near Monmouth Street in Soho,
                       are to be sold two new Billiard Tables,
                       and all other goods and conveniences
                       fit for a Coffee House,' etc. And
                       again: 'A very good French Billiard
                       Table little the worse for wearing,
                       full size, with all the Materials fit for
                       French or English play &amp;c. Enquire
                       at Scot's  Coffee House.'   Indeed
Cotton says there were few towns of note in England which
had not a public billiard-table. He, however, warns people
against' those spunging Caterpillars, which swarm where any
Billiard Tables are set up, who make that single room their
Shop, Kitching and Bed Chamber.'
   The rough sports, such as cudgel-playing, football, wrest-
ling, throwing, boxing, leaping, and running, were kept alive
by the country wakes, which took place on the dedication
festival of the parish church. These were sometimes supple-
mented by a grinning match, such as that which drew down

  1 This illustration, although from the 1709 edition of Cotton's Compleat
Gamester, is of older date; indeed, it is identical with the first edition of 1674.
The fact of its being a text-book in Anne's reign shows that the game had not
then been modified.

Addison's wrath,1 and which was afterwards abandoned, in
deference to his opinion.
    Near London these wakes, like Hampstead or Deptford
wakes, were well kept up; and there was my Lady Butter-
field in Epping Forest, of whose entertainment and calf-
roasting we have already had a description through Ward's
instrumentality. Here is one of her advertisements: 'My
Lady Butterfield gives a Challenge to all England, to Ride
a Horse, Leap a Horse, Run on Foot or Hallow with any
Woman in England Ten years younger, but not a Day
older, because she would not under value herself. Gentlemen
and Ladies, whilst in the Spring 'tis worth your while to
come to hear the Nightingal Sing in Wanstead within a Mile
of the Green Man, in Essex, at my Lady Butterfields at
Nightingal Hall. This is to give notice to all Gentlemen and
Ladies, and all the best of my Friends, that on the last
Wednesday of April is my feast, where is very good Enter-
tainment for that Day, and for all the Year after from my
Lady Butterfield.'
   Or another:-
              TO ALL GENTLEMEN AND LADIES.
         If Rare Good young Beans and Pease can Tempt Ye,
         Pray pass not by my Hall with Bellies Empty;
         For Kind Good Usage every one can tell,
         My Lady Butterfield does al excell;
         At Wanstead Town, a Mile of the Green Man,
         Come if you dare and stay away if you can.

   She had a rival later on, in 1713. 'This is to acquaint
all Jolly Lads and Lasses.  That on Monday the 28th
Instant, there will be a Meeting of several Gentlemen and
Ladies at the Opening of Mr. Tucker's new House upon
Epping Forest, where the Company will be provided with
good Music and Dancing, and be likewise entertain'd by
Country People with the following Diversions, viz. A Beaver
Hat to be Cudgell'd for, A Pair of Buckskin Breeches to be
wrestled for; and a lac'd Holland Smock to be danced for,
by 6 young Women. N.B. The Sport begins at 10 a Clock

in the Morning; and such care is taken that the Company
may not return a hungry, One Ox will then be roasted and
given gratis.'
   Women raced for smocks, silk stockings, or topknots;
whilst one would surely have won Sir John Astley's heart.
'This is to give Notice, That there is a young Woman,
born within 30 Miles of London, will run, for Fifty or a
Hundred Pounds, a Mile and an half, with any other Woman
that has liv'd a Year within the same Distance; upon any
good Ground, as the Parties concern'd shall agree to.'
   Even a woman's suspected infidelity was turned into
sport. 'At Hammersmith near Kensington, to morrow, being
Friday, will be rode a SKIMMINGTON TRIUMPH, according
to the Manner described in Hudibras,' which the reader will
find, if he be curious in the matter, in Part. II. Canto II. of
Butler's immortal poem.
   One harmless diversion should not be passed over. 'At
Epsom Old Wells . . . on Whitsun Tuesday will be Moris
Dancing Set against Set, for Lac'd Hats, at 10 a Clock, with
other Diversions.'
   But the game, par excellence, which combined out-of-door
sport with the minimum of fatigue, suitable alike to the
mercurial young, and the steady middle-aged, was bowling;
and the bowling greens multiplied exceedingly in this reign,
especially (judging by the advertisements) after 1706. We
hear of them starting up in all the suburbs: at Putney,
Hoxton, Maribone, Hampstead, Stoke Newington, Ham
Lane, etc.
   That the bowls were the same as are now played with
we see by the following advertisement: ' Lost out of the
Bowl House belonging to Pemlico Green in Hogsdon near
Shoreditch two pair of Lignum Vitae Bowls and one pair of a
reddish Wood.' It was not an expensive recreation. 'The
New Green over against Bunhill fields will be open'd on
Saturday next, and the Old Green to be Bowled on for Six
Pence and One Penny for taking up.' Sometimes there were
prizes bowled for, as 'At the Black Gray hound Dog at
Bristow Causey, will be a Silver Tobacco Box Bouled for,
value 30s.'

  It was essentially a sober cit's amusement.  ' I wonder
how so many Fat Gentlemen can endure the Green all Day,
tho' tis pleasant enough to look out o' the window and
observe 'em-To see a Tun o' Grease, with a broad fiery
Face, and a little black cap, waddle after a Bowl, rub, rub,
rub, rub, rub, and lose more Fat in getting a Shilling-Than
wou'd yield him a Crown at the Tallow Chandler's.' 1 'A
Bowling Green is a Place where there are three Things
thrown away besides Bowls, viz. Time, Money, and Curses;
the last ten for one.  The best Sport in it, is a sight of the
Gamesters, and the looker on enjoys it more than him that
Plays. It is the School of Wrangling, nay worse than the
Schools, for Men will cavil here for a Hair's bredth, and
make a Dispute, where a Straw might end the Controversie.
No Antick screws his Body into such strange Postures; and
you would think 'em mad, to hear 'em make Supplication to
their Bowls, and exercise their Rhetorick to intreat a good
Cast.' 2 A great nuisance in these public bowling-grounds
were the people who betted on the players' skill. 'Cuff.
Let's be sure to bet all we can. I have known a great Bowler
whose Better's place was worth above 200l. a year, without
venturing a farthing for himself.' 3
   'A Bowling Green is one of the most agreeable Compart-
ments of a Garden, and, when 'tis rightly placed, nothing is
more pleasant to the Eye. It's hollow Figure covered with a
beautiful Carpet of Turf very Smooth, and of a lively green,
most commonly encompassed with a Row of tall Trees with
Flower bearing Shrubs, make a delightful composition; be-
sides the Pleasure it affords us, of lying along upon its
sloping Banks, in the Shade, during the hottest weather.' 4 It
must have delighted a gardener's heart, in those days, to
have had something which must, almost of necessity, be orna-
mented in a somewhat formal manner. There were no land-
scape gardeners then, they were all fettered by the precision
style of elaborate parterres, terraces, cut trees, statuary;
and although a more educated mind pined for a better
state of things, as is evidenced throughout the Spectator
    1 Tunbridge Walks.  2 Hickelty Pickelty.  3 Epsom Wells.

whenever mention is made of a garden, the tyranny
of custom  and the gardeners prevailed.  'Our trees rise
in Cones, Globes, and Pyramids. We see the Marks of
the Scissors upon every Plant and Bush. I do not know
whether I am singular in my Opinion, but, for my own part,
I would rather look upon a Tree in all its Luxuriancy and
Diffusion of Boughs and Branches, than when it is thus cut
and trimmed into a Mathematical Figure; and cannot but
fancy that an Orchard in flower looks infinitely more de-
lightful than all the little Labyrinths of the most finished
Parterre.' 1 These parterres were made in as elaborate devices
as some of our specimens of leaf-gardening, and looked very
formal.
   In the Guardian (No. 173) this practice of clipping trees
is ridiculed most unmercifully. 'I know an eminent cook,
who beautified his Country seat with a Coronation dinner in
greens; where you see the Champion flourishing on horse-
back at one end of the table, and the queen in perpetual
youth at the other. For the benefit of all my loving Country-
men of this Curious taste, I shall here publish a Catalogue of
greens to be disposed of by an eminent town gardener....
Adam and Eve in Yew; Adam a little Shattered by the

   There were many works on gardening published in this
reign, notably that by James, which was a translation from
the French. It is enriched with beautiful designs for par-
terres, etc., and is undoubtedly the handsomest work on the
subject. Van Oosten's 'Dutch Gardener' is another transla-
tion, as is 'the Retir'd Gard'ner' of London and Wise. The
latter is a book of about 800 pages, with several woodcuts
                     1 Spectator, No. 414.

and copperplate engravings, and consists of two parts-one
a translation of 'Le Jardinier Solitaire,' and the other from
the work of the Sieur Louis Ligers. This was edited by
George London and Henry Wise, who are more than once
mentioned in the Spectator. They were practical gardeners,
and their nurseries far surpassed all others in England.
London was chief gardener to William and Mary, and
afterwards to Anne. During her reign the nurseries were
let to a man named Swinburne, but the name of the original
firm was still kept up.
   There is, however, an excellent book in English called
'the Clergy Man's Recreation,' by John Laurence, A.M., 1714,
but it is all about the cultivation of fruit trees.
   Plants would even grow out of doors in the City then,
and we find the fore courts of houses planted, or at all events
the walls covered, with jasmines, vines, etc. Whilst the news-
papers advertise for sale, 'Yews, Hollys and all sorts of
Fillbrea Laurell &amp;c. with all sorts of Fine Flowering Trees as
Honi suckles, Cittisus, Roses, Saevays both Headed and
Pyramid, Orange Trees, and Spanish Jesemins, Gilded Hollys
Pyramid and Headed, Filleroys, Lawrel Tines, and Arbour
Vitae,' and amongst the flowers were 'Double Emonies,
Ranckilos, Tulips, Aurickelouses, Double Anemonies, Double
Ranunculos and Double Junquils.'  Ranunculus seems to
have been a puzzling word, for once again we find it spelt
' Renunculices.'
    Town and country were eminently antagonistic. The
want of means of communication kept country people in a
state of stagnation, compared to their brethren of the town,
whose more fastidious taste could not brook the boorish
behaviour, and coarse pleasures, of the countryman.
    ' Woodcock. No Londiner shall either ruin my Daughter,
 or waste my Estate-If he be a Gamester 'tis rattl'd away
 in two Nights-If a lewd fellow, 'tis divided into Settle-

   'Reynard. So that instead of providing her a Gentle-
man, you'd Sacrifice her to a Brute; who has neither
Manners enough to be thought Rational, Education enough
for a Justice of the Peace, nor wit enough to distinguish fine
Conversation from the Yelping of Dogs; Hunts all the
Morning, topes all the Afternoon, and then goes lovingly
Drunk to Bed to his Wife.
   ' Woodcock. And pray, what are your Town Diver-
sions ? To hear a parcel of Italian Eunuchs, like so many
Cats, squawll out somewhat you don't understand. The
Song of my Lady's Birthday, by an honest Farmer, and a
Merry Jig by a Country Wench that has Humour in her
Buttocks, is worth Forty on't; Your Plays, your Park, and all
your Town Diversions together, don't afford half so sub-
stantial a Joy as going home thoroughly wet and dirty after
a fatiguing Fox Chace, and Shifting one's self by a good
Fire. Neither are we Country Gentlemen such Ninnies as
you make us; we have good Estates, therefore want not the
Knavery and Cunning of the Town; but we are Loyal Sub-
jects, true Friends, and never scruple to take our Bottle,
because we are guilty of nothing which we are afraid of dis-
covering in our Cups.'  A very pretty quarrel as it stood,
and one on which, as Sir Roger remarked,' much might be
said on both sides,' for Addison2 rather grumbles at the
old-fashioned courtesy of the well-bred squire, as opposed to
the greater ease of manners then in vogue: 'If, after this,
we look on the People of Mode in the Country, we find in
them the Manners of the last Age. They have no sooner
fetched themselves up to the Fashion of the polite World,
but the Town has dropped them, and are nearer to the first
State of Nature than to those refinements which formerly
reign'd in the Court, and still prevail in the Country. One
may now know a Man that never conversed in the World,
by his Excess of Good Breeding. A polite Country Squire
shall make you as many Bows in half an hour, as would
serve a Courtier for a Week. There is infinitely more to

do about Place and Precedency in a meeting of Justices
Wives, than in an Assembly of Dutchesses.'
   But if the country aristocracy were so behindhand, in
what state were the labourers? Their lot was hard work
and scant wage, only relieved by a village wake or a country
fair; no education, no hope of any better position, of the
earth, earthy; a man rose at early morning, worked hard all
day, came home to sleep, and so on without intermission.
Gay thus describes him and his labours:-

          If in the Soil you guide the crooked Share,
          Your early Breakfast is my Constant Care.
          And when with even Hand you strow the Grain,
          I fright the thievish Rooks from off the Plain.
          In misling Days when I my Threasher heard,
          With Nappy Beer I to the Barn repair'd;
          Lost in the Musick of the whirling Flail,
          To gaze on thee I left the smoaking Pail;
          In Harvest, when the Sun was mounted high,
          My Leather Bottle did thy Drought supply;
          When e'er you mow'd I follow'd with the Rake,
          And have full oft been Sun burnt for thy Sake;
          When in the Welkin gath'ring Show'rs were seen,
          I lagg'd the last with Colin on the Green;
          And when at Eve returning with thy Carr,
          Awaiting heard the gingling Bells from far;
          Strait on the Fire the sooty Pot I plac't,
          To warm thy Broth I burnt my Hands for Haste.
          When hungry thou stood'st staring, like an Oaf,
          I slic'd the Luncheon from the Barly Loaf,
          With crumbled Bread I thicken'd well thy Mess,
          Ah, love me more, or love thy Pottage less !1

    The dress of the labourer at this time was a broad-
brimmed flap felt hat, a jerkin, or short coat, knee breeches
and stockings; whilst the women wore their dresses very
plainly made-necessarily without furbelows and hoops, and,
for headgear, had a very sensible broad-brimmed straw hat,
or, on holidays, the high-crowned felt hat.
