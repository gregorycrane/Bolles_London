<div1 type="chapter" n="1" id="c.1"><HEAD>Chapter I:  Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery.</HEAD>
 
<p>Let us find ourselves again at Charing Cross, which forms the south-eastern angle of <rs type=subject>Trafalgar Square</rs>, a dreary expanse of granite with <num value="2">two</num> granite fountains, intended to commemorate the last victory of Nelson. Its northern side is occupied by the miserable buildings of the National Gallery; its eastern and   western sides by a hideous hotel and a frightful club.   Where the noble Jacobian screen of Northumberland House (which was so admirably adapted for a National Portrait Gallery) once drew the eye away from these abominations by its dignity and beauty, a view of the funnel-roof of Charing Cross Railway Station forms a poor substitute for the time-honoured palace of the Percy's!   In the centre of the square is a Corinthian pillar of Devonshire granite, <num value="145">145</num> feet in   height, by <hi rend=italics>W. Railton</hi>, erected in <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>. It supports a statue of Nelson by <hi rend=italics>E. H.. Baily, R.A</hi>., a very poor work, which, however, does not much signify, as it can only be properly seen from the top of the Duke of York's column, which no <num value="1">one</num> ascends.   The pedestal of the column is decorated by reliefs. <pb id="p.2" n="2">

   <p>The noble lions at the foot of the column were added by 
<hi rend=italics>Sir E. Landseer</hi> in <datestruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct>. Only <num value="1">one</num> of them was modelled: a slight variation in the treatment adapted the others to their pedestals. Their chief grandeur lies in their mighty simplicity. 
   <p>At the south-west angle of the square is a statue of Sir  C. S. Napier by <hi rend=italics>Adams</hi>; at the south-east angle a statue of  Sir Henry Havelock by <hi rend=italics>Behnes.</hi>   On a pedestal at the north-west corner is an equestrian statue of George IV. by 
 <hi rend=italics>Chantrey</hi>, intended to surmount the Marble Arch when it stood in front of Buckingham Palace. The corresponding pedestal is vacant, and likely to remain so: there has never been a pendant to George IV. 
    <p>On the east side of Trafalgar Square is its <num value="1">one</num> ornament.  Here, on a noble basement, approached by a broad flight of steps, rises the beautiful portico of the <pb id="p.3" n="3"> 
<rs type=subject>Church of St. Martin in the Fields</rs>.     It is the masterpiece   of <hi rend=italics>Gibbs</hi>
(<datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>-<num value="26">26</num>), and is the only perfect example of a Grecian portico in London. The regular rectangular plan on which Trafalgar Square was <num value="1">first</num> laid out was abandoned simply to bring it into view; yet, in <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>, the Metropolitan Board of Works, for the sake of giving uniformity to a new street, seriously contemplated the destruction of the well-graded basement to which it owes all its beauty of proportion, and which is <num value="1">one</num> of the chief features of a Greek portico. However, Parliament happily interfered, and the portico survives. 
   <p><QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE>Beautiful for situation, elegant in proportion, and perfect in construction, it is precisely the kind of building that the angle of Trafalgar Square requires. It is thoroughly in its place, is in harmony with all its surroundings, and lends more grace than it receives to  <Q> the finest site in Europe.</Q>  From whatever point it is seen, it impresses the beholder as a work of art, impelling him to draw nearer and examine it in detail, and unlike many other architectural structures it does not disappoint upon examination.</QUOTE><BIBL>-Morning Post, <datestruct VALUE="1877-02--"><month reg="02">Feb.</month>, <year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></CIT></QUOTE>
 
   <p>The building of St. Martin's is commemorated in the lines of Savage-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>O Gibbs! whose art the solemn fane can raise, 
<L>Where God delights to dwell, and man to praise.</QUOTE>
 But its portico is its best feature, and the effect even of this is injured by the tower, which seems to rise out of it. The sides of the church are poor; <QUOTE>in all,</QUOTE> as Walpole says, <QUOTE>is wanting that harmonious simplicity which bespeaks a genius.</QUOTE> The vane on the handsome steeple bears a crown, to show that this is the royal parish. In its upper story is preserved a <QUOTE>sanctus bell</QUOTE> from   the earlier church on this <pb id="p.4" n="4"> site; it was rung at the point when the priest said <QUOTE>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabaoth,</QUOTE> that the Catholic population outside might share in   the feeling of the service. 
   <p>The existence of a church here is mentioned as early as <datestruct value="1222"><year reg="1222">1222</year></datestruct>.   Henry VIII. was induced to rebuild it by the annoyance which he felt at the funerals constantly passing his windows of Whitehall on their way to St. Margaret's, and his church, still really <QUOTE>in the Fields,</QUOTE> to which a chancel was added by Prince Henry in <datestruct value="1607--"><year reg="1607">1607</year></datestruct>, became a favourite burial-place in the time of the Stuarts. It may be called the artists' church, for amongst those interred here were Nicholas Hiliard, miniature-painter to Elizabeth, <datestruct value="1619--"><year reg="1619">1619</year></datestruct>; Paul Vansomer, painter to James I., <datestruct value="1621--"><year reg="1621">1621</year></datestruct>; Sir John Davies the poet, author of <QUOTE lang=la>Nosce teipsum,</QUOTE> so much extolled by Hallam and Southey, <datestruct value="1626--"><year reg="1626">1626</year></datestruct>; Nicholas Laniere the musician, <datestruct value="1646--"><year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct>; Dobson, the <num value="1">first</num> eminent portrait-painter of English birth, called <QUOTE>the English Vandyke,</QUOTE> <datestruct value="1646--"><year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct>; Nicholas Stone the sculptor, <datestruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct>; and Louis Laguerre, <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>. The Hon. Robert Boyle (<datestruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>), the religious philosopher, author of many theological works, was buried here, and his funeral sermon was preached by Bishop Burnet, who was his intimate friend. <num value="2">Two</num> of the tombs from the ancient church, those of Sir Thomas Mayere, physician to James I. and Charles I.,  <datestruct value="1655--"><year reg="1655">1655</year></datestruct>-<num value="56">56</num>, and of Secretary Coventry, <datestruct value="1686--"><year reg="1686">1686</year></datestruct>, are preserved in the vaults of the present edifice. The register of the church records the baptism of the great Lord Bacon, born hard by at York House, in <datestruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct>.   It has been said that Prince Charles Edward renounced the religion of his forefathers here.<NOTE id="n.4.1">Walpole's <title>Letters to Sir Horace Mann</title>.</NOTE>
 <pb id="p.5" n="5"> 
   <p>Amongst those who were buried in the churchyard was (<datestruct VALUE="1615-11-15"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=15>15</day>, <year reg=1615>1615</year></datestruct>) the beautiful Mrs. Anne Turner, who was hanged at Tyburn for her part in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, and who, <QUOTE>having been the <num value="1">first</num> person. to bring yellow   starched ruffs into popularity, was condemned by Coke to be hang'd in her yellow Tiffiny ruff and cuffs,</QUOTE> the hangman also having his bands and cuffs of the same, <QUOTE>which made many to forbear the use of that horrid starch, till it at last grew   generally to be detested and disused.</QUOTE> After he had lain in   state, the   murdered   body   of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey <NOTE id="n.5.1">Macaulay and others write the name Edmundsbury. But in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey there is a monument to a brother of Sir Edmund, where he is designated as Edmundus Berry Godfrey. The best authority, however, is Sir Edmund's father. The Diary of Thomas Godfrey of Lidd, in Kent, says, <QUOTE>My wife was delivered of another son the <datestruct VALUE="1621-12-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1621">1621</year></datestruct>, who was christened the <datestruct VALUE="-01-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, being Sunday. His godfather was my cousin John Berrie, his other godfather my faithful loving friend and my neighbour sometime in Greek Street, Mr. Edmund Harrison, the king's embroiderer. They named my son Edmund Berrie, the <num value="1">one</num>'s name, and the other's Christian name.</QUOTE> </NOTE> was buried in this churchyard in <datestruct value="1679--"><year reg="1679">1679</year></datestruct>, with an immense public funeral, at the head of which walked <num value="72">seventy-two</num> clergymen of the Church of England, in full canonicals; John Lacy, the dramatist, was buried here in <datestruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></datestruct>; Sir Winston Churchill, father of the great Duke of Marlborough, in <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>; George Farquhar, the comedy-writer and friend of Wilkes, in <datestruct value="1707--"><year reg="1707">1707</year></datestruct>; and Lord Mohun, killed   in   duel with   the   Duke   of Hamilton, in <datestruct value="1711--"><year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct> Hogarth and Reynolds here followed Roubiliac to his grave, which was near that.of Nell Gwynne, who died of an apoplexy in her house in Pall Mall in <datestruct value="1687--"><year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct>, being only in her <num value="38">thirty-eighth</num> year.. She left an annual sum of money to the bell-ringers which they still enjoy.   Archbishop Tenison, who had attended her death-bed, preached her funeral sermon here with great extolling of her virtues, <pb id="p.6" n="6"> a fact which, repeated to Queen Mary II. by the desire of his enemies to bring him into discredit, only drew from her the answer, <QUOTE>I have heard as much. It is a sign that the unfortunate woman died penitent; for if I can read a man's heart through his looks, had she not made a pious and Christian end, the doctor would never have been induced to speak well of her.</QUOTE> 
   <p>The parish of St. Martin's, now much subdivided, was formerly the largest in London. Burnet speaks of it in <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct> as <QUOTE>the greatest cure in England,</QUOTE> and Baxter tells how its population consisted of <num value="40000">40,000</num> persons more than could find room in the church. The labyrinthine alleys near the church, destroyed in the formation of Trafalgar Square, were known as <QUOTE>the Bermudas;</QUOTE> hence the reference in Ben Jonson-

    <p>In the time of the Commonwealth St. Martin's Lane was a shady lane with a hedge on either side. It was open country as far as the village of St. Giles's. In a proclamation of <datestruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct>, Henry VIII. desires to have <QUOTE>the games of  Hare, Partridge, Pheasant and Heron,</QUOTE> preserved from the  Palace of Westminster to St. Giles's in the Fields. In  Faithorne's Map of London, <datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>, St. Martin's Lane is the western boundary of the town. At <num value="1">one</num> time the Lane was the especial resort of artists, and in <num value="1">one</num> of its entries, <rs type=subject>St.  Peter's Court</rs>, was the <num value="1">first</num> house of the Royal Academy.

    <p>The ambition of London tradesmen   might justly feel encouraged by the almost European reputation which was obtained in his own day by Thomas Chippendale, a cabinet. maker of St. Martin's Lane, and which has not diminished, but increased, since his death.

   <p>The National Collection of pictures originated in the purchase   of Mr. Angerstein's   Gallery   on   the urgent advice of Sir George Beaumont, who added to it his own collection of pictures, in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>.   It has since then been enormously increased by donations and purchases.   A sum   of <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure>.<num value="000">000</num> is annually allotted   to the purchase of pictures. The contents of the gallery were rehung in <pb id="p.9" n="9"> <datestruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></datestruct>, when many new rooms were opened, which allow an advantageous arrangement of the pictures, but are full of meretricious taste in their upper decorations, and of tawdry colour injurious to the effect of the precious works of art they contain.   The collection (according to the numbers attached to the Rooms) begins with the specimens of the British school; but alas I the curators are only beginning to realise the truth of Ruskin's advice that-

If catching the manners and follies of an age <hi rend=italics>living as they rise</hi>, if general satire on vices and ridicules, familiarised by strokes of nature, and heightened by wit, and the whole animated by proper and just expressions of the passions, be comedy, Hogarth composed comedies as much as Moliere; in his Marriage a la Mode there is even an intrigue carried on throughout the piece. . .. Hogarth had no model to follow and improve upon. He created his art; and used colours instead of language. He resembles Butler, but his subjects are more universal, and amidst all his pleasantry, he observes the true end of comedy, reformation; there is always a moral to his pictures. Sometimes he rose to tragedy, not in the catastrophe of kings and heroes, but in marking how vice conducts insensibly and incidentally to misery and shame. He warns against encouraging cruelty and idleness in young minds; and discerns how the different vices of the great and the vulgar lead by various paths to the same unhappiness.</QUOTE><BIBL>-Walpole,

The Virgin and St. Anne are enthroned. The Child, on its mother's knee, stretches to take an apple from St. Anne, the very type of a grandmother, whose aged face--the noblest in the picture-is full of playful affection: on the left are St. Sebastian and St. Paul, on the right St. Lawrence and St. Romualdo.

On the left is a noble triumphant St. Michael, with wings half scaly, half feathered: the scales with which he weighs souls hang on a tree beside him. On the right, St. Raphael leads the young beautiful Tobias, who carries his fish, through a flowery meadow. This picture belonged to an altar-piece in <num value="3">three</num> parts painted for the Certosa of Pavia. <num value="1">One</num> of the upper parts remains there still, the other compartments are supplied by copies.

Of <num value="2">two</num> angels, <num value="1">one</num> looks indifferently out of the picture: the other gazes in rapturous awe at something beyond the group. Such strange rocks as are introduced here may be frequently seen in the Apennines at La Vernia. The ethereal glories here are peculiar to Florentine masters of this period.

<p><num value="293">293</num>. <hi rend=italics>Filippino Lippi</hi>.   A grand weird picture.   The Virgin and <pb id="p.30" n="30"> Child are in a wild Apennine landscape between St. Jerome and St.. Anthony--a noble figure with his book and lily. Behind St. Anthony the simple hermit life of the mountain is portrayed.   Behind St. Jerome, his lion defends his lair against the pig (a wild boar) of St. Anthony. This picture, in its marvellous finish, introduces the peculiar flowers of the high mountains in Tuscany. In the predella is St. Joseph of Arimathea supporting the dead Christ between St. Francis and the Magdalen. The arms of the family indicate the picture having been painted for the Ruccellai Chapel at Florence, where it long remained in the Church of St. Pancrazio.

St. Roch and the Angel-splendid in colour.   St. Roch is always represented with the ulcer in his leg, which resulted from his devotion to those sick of the plague at Piacenza, but which caused him to be exiled from the haunts of men for fear of infection: in his solitude he was supported by his little dog, which brought him bread from the city.

Sebastian had already enlisted himself as a partisan of Michel Angelo in his rivalry with Raffaelle, and it is generally believed that in this instance the greater master-<QUOTE lang=it>il dio di disegno</QUOTE>-furnished the drawing of some of the figures, if not the design of the whole composition.

With the desert all ringing with the mad cymbals of his followers, made lucid with the presence and new offers of a god--as if unconscious of Bacchus, or but idly casting her eyes as upon some unconcerning pageant, her soul undisturbed from Theseus, Ariadne is still pacing the solitary shore, in as much heart-silence, and in almost the same local solitude, with which she awoke at daybreak to catch the forlorn last glances of the sail that bore away the Athenian.</QUOTE><BIBL>-Charles Lamb.</BIBL></CIT></QUOTE>

<p>From   Trafalgar Square, Pall Mall, the handsomest street in London, leads to the west.   Its name is a record of its having been the place where the game of Palle-malle was played--a game still popular in the deserted streets of old sleepy Italian cities, and deriving its name from   <foreign lang=it>Palla</foreign>, a ball, and <foreign lang=it>Maglia</foreign> a mallet.   It was already introduced into England in the reign of James I., who (in his <QUOTE lang=greek>*basiliko\n *dw=ron</QUOTE>) recommended his son Prince Henry to play at it. Charles II., who was passionately fond of the game, removed the site for it to St. James's Park.<NOTE id="n.43.1">Curious details as to the game are given in <bibl><title>Le Jen de Mail, par Joseph Lanthier</title>, <datestruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct>.</bibl> It was played with balls made from the root of box, which were gradually attuned to the stroke of the mallet, and were always rubbed with pellitory before being put away after use.</NOTE>

   <p>It was across the ground afterwards set apart for Pallemalle, described by Le Serre as <QUOTE>near the avenues of the (St. James's) palace--a large meadow, always green, in which ladies walk in summer,</QUOTE> that Sir Thomas Wyatt led his rebel troops into London in <datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct>, passing with little loss under the fire of the artillery planted on Hay Hill by the Earl of Pembroke, and forcing his way successfully through the guard drawn out to defend Charing Cross, but <pb id="p.44" n="44"> only to be deserted by his men and taken prisoner as he entered the City. 
    <p>The street was not enclosed till about <datestruct value="1690--"><year reg="1690">1690</year></datestruct>, when it was at <num value="1">first</num> called Catherine Street, in honour of Catherine of Braganza, and it still continued to be a fashionable promenade rather than a highway for carriage traffic.

    <p>In No. x, Hamilton Place (named from James Hamilton, ranger of Hyde Park under Charles II.) lived the great <pb id="p.84" n="84"> Lord Eldon. Just beyond we may notice No. <num value="139">139</num>, Piccadilly Terrace, as the house in which the separation between Lord and Lady Byron took place. 
   <p>Returning to <rs type=subject>Berkeley Street</rs> (named from John, Lord Berkeley of Stratton, Lord Deputy of Ireland in the time of Charles II.), we may remember that it was the London residence of Alexander Pope.   On the left is <rs type=subject>Lansdowne Passage</rs>, a stone alley sunk in the gardens of Lansdowne House, leading to Bolton Row. The bar which crosses its entrance is a curious memorial of London highwaymen, having been put up in the last century to prevent their escape that way, after a mounted highwayman had ridden full gallop up the steps, having fled through Bolton Row, after robbing his victims in Piccadilly. This is <QUOTE>the dark uncanny-looking passage</QUOTE> described by Trollope in <title>Phineas Redux </title> with a persistency which almost impresses the fact as real, as the scene of Mr. Bonteen's murder-<QUOTE>It was on the steps leading up from the passage to the level of the ground above that the body was found.</QUOTE>

   <p>On the left a heavy screen of foliage gives almost the seclusion of the country to <rs type=subject>Lansdowne House</rs>, which stands in a large garden approached by gates decorated with the bee-hives which are the family crest. The house was built <pb id="p.85" n="85"> by Robert Adam   for the prime-minister Lord Bute, and, while still unfinished, was sold to William Petty, Earl of Shelburne, who became prime-minister on the death of Lord Rockingham, and upon whom   the title of Marquis of Lansdowne was conferred by Pitt, from Lansdowne Hill, near Bath, part of the property of his wife, Sophia, daughter of John, Earl Granville.

   <p>The adjoining house, ugly and poverty-stricken as it looks now, was that in which Sir Isaac Newton passed the latter years of his life, in an honoured old age, from <datestruct value="1710--"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1725--"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>, <num value="2">two</num> years before his death at Kensington. He had been made Master of the Mint under Anne, and in <datestruct value="1703--"><year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct> became President of the Royal Society. Always frugal in his own habits, he devoted his wealth to the poor, especially to the French refugees in his neighbourhood.   In the observatory on the top of his house he was wont to say that   the happiest years of his life were spent. This observatory, once used as a Sunday school, was kept up till <datestruct value="1824"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct> for the inspection of the foreign visitors who came by thousands to visit it, and who now, when they come to seek it, turn away disgusted at the treatment which the shrines of their illustrious dead meet with at the hands of Englishmen, for it was sold some years since to supply some pews for the chapel next door. 
   <p>The house was afterwards inhabited by Dr. Burney, whose celebrated daughter wrote her <title>Evelina</title> here. John Opie, the artist, who died in <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, lived close by; and   Thomas Holcroft, the novelist and dramatist, was born in St. Martin's Street in <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>, being the son of a shoemaker. 
   <p>Leicester Square   was formerly decorated by a statue of George I., brought from the seat of the Duke of Buckingham at Canons: in <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct>. After the square was railed in, it became a favourite site for duels, and the duel between Captain French and Captain Coote was fought here in <datestruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct>, in which the latter was killed.   In his <hi rend=italics>Esmond</hi>, Thackeray, true to his picture of the times, narrates how Lord Mohun and Lord Castlewood-having seen Mrs. <pb id="p.130" n="130"> Bracegirdle act, and having supped at the.

   <p>From   the beginning of the present century Leicester Square began to decline, and gradually presented that aspect of ruin which is said to have given rise to Ledru Rollin's work on the decadence of England.   In <num value="185">185</num>   its area was leased, and its miseries were concealed by the erection of Wyld's Globe, while the neighbouring houses were given up to taverns, exhibitions of waxworks, acrobatic feats, or panoramas. After the Globe was cleared away, the area remained uncared for, and the statue perished slowly under generations of practical jokes, till Mr. Albert Grant took pity upon the square in <datestruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>, decorated it in the centre with a statue of Shakspeare (a copy of that in Westminster Abbey), and at the corners with busts of <num value="4">four</num> of the most famous residents-Hogarth, Newton, Hunter, and Reynolds, and opened it to the public.

There it was founded by Matilda of Boulogne, the half-Saxon princess who, being niece of Matilda the Good, stole the hearts of the English people from   the Norman Matilda for her husband, King Stephen. Its inmates were perpetually to pray for the souls of her <num value="2">two</num> dead eldest children, Baldwin and Maud. Eleanor, wife of Edward I., and Philippa, wife of Edward III., did much to enrich the hospital.   The. patronage has always rested with the Queens of England, and the presentations are usually given to those who have been connected with the Court. There are <num value="4">four</num> brethren and <num value="4">four</num> sisters, who are supplied here with incomes, houses, and small gardens of their own. The modern chapel contains some of the fittings of the old <num value="1">one</num> (in which Katherine the Fair, widow of Henry V., lay in state before her burial at Westminster), the stalls, and a pulpit of wood given by Sir Julius Caesar, who was Master of the Hospital, and inscribed <QUOTE>Ezra the Scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which he had made for the preachin.

In fact, the whole place is desecrated and ruined. 
   <p>Entering the church, we may notice on the north wall, under the gallery, an unknown monument of Purbeck marble, with recesses for brasses. In the north gallery is a monument to Thomas Doughty, <datestruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>, <num value="1">first</num> owner of the Doughty estate, of which the name became so familiar in <pb id="p.145" n="145"> the Tichborne trial.

   <p>The neighbourhood of St. Pancras was peopled at the end of the last century by noble fugitives from the great French Revolution, and for the most part they are buried in this churchyard, which is crowded with remarkable memorials of the dead.

 Under the Tudors the character of St. Giles's was changed from a country village to that of <num value="1">one</num> of the poorest parishes in London. <QUOTE>A cellar in St. Giles's</QUOTE> has long been an epithet to denote the lowest grade of poverty. In <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, during the Great Plague, <num value="3216">3,216</num> persons died in St. Giles's alone.

Much harm has been done by the ill-judged benevolence of writers of little religious books, and the exaggerated pictures they have drawn of the poverty of this district, resulting in unnecessarily large subscriptions, which destroy the habit of self-dependence amongst the inhabitants. There is seldom absolute destitution   except amongst those who, having <pb id="p.159" n="159"> fallen from better days, have never been able to acquire the habit of work. Old-clothes-men, bird-fanciers, bird-cage makers, and   ballad-mongers drive   the most flourishing trades. Apropos of the latter, Walford's <title>Old and New London</title> gives an amusing account of the origin of the expression <QUOTE>Catchpenny,</QUOTE> in the displeasure of the people at being taken in by the ingenuity of James Catnach, a popular ballad printer in Monmouth Court, who, after the murder of Weare by Thurtell, obtained a great sale for a broadside, which he headed, <QUOTE>WE ARE ALIVE AGAIN,</QUOTE> which the public read as WEARE.

 <pb id="p.164" n="164"> When the changeable tide of fashion in the last century flowed north from   the neighbourhood of St. Clement Danes and Whitehall, it settled with a deceptive grasp, which seemed likely to be permanent, on the estate of the Duke of Bedford.   Everything here commemorates the glories of that great ducal family. Bloomsbury Street and Square, Chenies Street, Francis Street, Tavistock Square, Russell Square, Bedford Square, and many places less important, have their names and titles.

She is chiefly celebrated, however, for her violent grief for the loss of her husband (who was also her brother), whose ashes she mixed daily with her drink, of whom she <pb id="p.170" n="170"> induced the most eminent Greek rhetoricians to proclaim the praises, and for whose loss she died in <num value="2">two</num> years of a broken heart, having erected to his memory a mausoleum which surpassed in splendour all the monuments of the ancient world. It was an edifice like an Ionic temple, raised on a lofty basement, and surmounted by a pyramid, with a chariot group on the summit. The whole was of Parian marble. Its architects were Satyros and Pythios. <num value="4">Four</num> great sculptors-Scopas, Leochares, Bryaxis, and Timotheos--were employed on its decorations; a <num value="5">fifth</num>, probably Pythios, made the crowning chariot group. From its beauty the name of mausoleum came to be applied to all similar monuments. The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus is mentioned by Vitruvius, Pliny, and Lucian, and is alluded to as a still-existing wonder by Eustathius, who wrote in the <num value="12">twelfth</num> century. After this it ceased to excite attention till, in <datestruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct>, <num value="13">thirteen</num> sculptured slabs were sent to England by Lord Stratford de Redcliffe from the Castle of Budrum, which had been built by the Knights of St. John in the ruins of Halicarnassus. In <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct> Mr. C. J. Newton, Keeper of the Greek and Roman antiquities of the British Museum, visited Budrum, and his discovery of the colossal lions inserted in the walls of the castle and other evident remains of the Mausoleum led the Government, in <datestruct VALUE="1856-11--"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>, to send out the steam corvette <hi rend=italics>Gorgon</hi>, with workmen, and a firman permitting them to excavate.

   <p>The <hi rend=italics>Elgin   Room</hi>   is almost entirely   devoted   to   the precious marbles removed by Lord Elgin from the Parthenon in <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct>, lost by shipwreck, recovered by divers, and purchased by Government, after long controversy, in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>.  It is almost forgotten   now   with what vituperation the marbles were assailed   on their arrival in England--they were <QUOTE>not originals,</QUOTE> they were <QUOTE>of the time of Hadrian,</QUOTE> they were the <QUOTE>works of journeymen, not deserving the name of artists,</QUOTE> they were <QUOTE>too much broken to be of any value.</QUOTE> The sum   paid to Lord Elgin was less than he had expended upon the marbles, and far less than Napoleon was willing to pay for them.   Yet now   they are <pb id="p.172" n="172"> recognised as the greatest masterpieces of Greek art in this or any other country.   A   model of the Parthenon (the Temple of Athene) here shows their original position. Around the room are the glorious frieze and metopes of the temple (their subjects are described beneath): we must remember that here they are, as it were, turned inside out. The frieze represents the procession which took place every <num value="5">five</num> years in honour of the goddess. The south side is the least perfect, having been injured by the winds from the sea: it is chiefly occupied by the victims, who made this procession a kind of cattle-show, as each of the Athenian colonies contributed, and, by their anxiety to shine in this, Athens knew the disposition of her colonies. Here also we see the maidens carrying the sacrificial vessels, the flat vessels being used for libations.   To meet this procession comes from the north side a long cavalcade of chariots and horsemen, many of the latter most glorious. From the east end of the temple, where the processions united, are representations of the gods, without whose presence no Greek festival was considered complete, and of the delivery of the <hi rend=italics>peplos</hi>, the embroidered veil of Athene, given every <num value="5">five</num> years. 
    <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>The Temple of Minerva in the Acropolis of Athens, erected by  Ictinus and Callicrates, was under the direction of Phidias, and to him we probably owe the composition, style, and character of the sculpture, in addition to much assistance in drawing, modelling, choice of the naked, and draperies, as well as occasional execution of parts in the marble. 
    <p> The emulators of Phidias were Alcamenes, Critias, Nestocles, and  Hegias; <num value="20">twenty</num> years after, Agelades, Gallon, Polycletus, Phragmon,  Gorgias, Lacon, Myron, Scopas, Pythagoras, and Perelius. 
<p><gap>

    <p>It is the peculiar character and praise of Phidias's style that ho represented gods better than men. As this sculptor determined the <pb id="p.173" n="173"> visible idea of Jupiter, his successors employed a <num value="100">hundred</num> years on the forms of the inferior divinities.

   <QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE>It is the union of nature with ideal beauty, the probabilities and accidents of bone, flesh, and tendon, from extension, flexion, compression, gravitation, action, or repose, that rank at once the Elgin Marbles above all other works of art in the world.

Every truth of shape, the result of the inherent organization of man as an intellectual being; every variation of that shape, produced by the slightest variation of motion, in consequence of the slightest variation of intention, acting on it; every result of repose on flesh as a soft substance, and on bone as a hard-both being influenced by the common principles of life and gravitation; every harmony of line in composition, from geometrical principle,--all proving the science of the artist; every beauty of conception proving his genius; and every grace of execution proving that practice has given his hand power, can be shown to exist in the Elgin Marbles....

    <p>On the left of the room are the sculptures from the eastern pediment of the temple, at which they occupied platforms at the <num value="2">two</num> ends, a much larger space in the middle than is seen here having been filled by figures which are lost. The subject of the whole is the Birth of Athene from the brain of Zeus. The father of the gods complaining <pb id="p.174" n="174"> of a violent pain in his head, Hephaestus split it open with his axe, when Athene sprang forth in full armour. The central figures are wanting: those of which we see the remnants represent the gods and goddesses who were present at the event, which is supposed to have taken place on Olympus.   At the south end of the pediment the horses of Helios, or the Sun, are rising from   the waves. at the north end Selene, or Night, is going down.

As the light streamed across the room and died away into obscurity, there was something awful and solemn in the grand forms and heads and trunks and fragments of mighty temples and columns that lay scattered about in sublime insensibility,--the remains, the only actual remains, of a mighty people.

Kouyunjik is believed to have been Nineveh itself, while the mound now   called   Nimroud, which is <num value="20">twenty</num> miles below the modern   Mosul, is believed   to have been the Calah of Scripture (Gen. x. <num value="8">8</num>-<num value="11">11</num>).

   <p>The <num value="2">second</num> series, of later date (Nos. <num value="45">45</num> to <num value="50">50</num>), exhibit the victories of Assurbanipal, grandson of Sennacherib, over the Elamites.

It is no longer Oxford Street. In other parts of London we have already seen how great a feature of the London of the Henrys and Edwards were the numerous streams which rose on the different hill-sides, and flowed towards the Thames or the Fleet, and which are now either swallowed up or arched over, though they sometimes leave the association of their name to a street which marks their rise or their <pb id="p.188" n="188"> course. <num value="1">One</num> of the most important of these streamlets, <num value="1">one</num> which flowed down the steep hill-side to join the Turnmill Brook where Farringdon Street now stands, was the Old Bourne or Hill Bourne, which broke out at the point now called Holborn Bars, and which, though it has totally disappeared now, still gives a name to the Old Bourne or Holborn Hill.   Till the end of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century this hill was almost in the open country, and, in the old maps of <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>, only a single row of houses will be seen on the north side of the thoroughfare. The street called Field Lane was a path between open fields, and Saffron Hill was an open park attached to the gardens of Ely House, and famous for its saffron. To the south were the broad acres of pasturage called Lincoln's Inn Fields, and barriers were erected to prevent the cattle which fed there from straying into the neighbouring highway, which are still commemorated in the openings called Great, Little, and New Turnstile. Gerard the herbalist, writing in <datestruct value="1597--"><year reg="1597">1597</year></datestruct>, mentions the large garden behind his house in Holborn, and the number of rare plants which grew there. 
   <p>Holborn, which escaped the Great Fire, still contains many old houses anterior to the reign of Charles II.. those beyond Holborn Bars to the west being outside the liberties of the City. Milton lived here from <datestruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>, and here wrote his <title>Tenure of Kings and Magistrates,</title> <title>Eiconoclastes,</title> and the <title>Defence of the People of England against Salmasius.</title> The hill of Holborn was called the <QUOTE>Heavy Hill,</QUOTE> for by it the condemned were driven to Tyburn from Newgate and the Tower, wearing on their breasts the nosegays which, by old custom, were always presented to them as they reached St. Sepulchre's Church.

 The garden of Ely House was great and famous. Saffron Hill still bears witness to the saffron which grew there, and Vine Street to its adjacent vineyard, while its roses and its strawberries are both matters of history.

 and the Bishop replies- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Marry, I will, my lord, with all my heart.</QUOTE>
 The Bishop then goes out to send for the strawberries, and, on his return, finds Gloucester gone, and exclaims- <QUOTE>Where is my lord of Gloucester? I have sent for those strawberries ;</QUOTE> <pb id="p.198" n="198"> and Lord Hastings replies-

But a few   minutes after Gloucester, returning, accuses Hastings of witchcraft, and he is hurried off to be beheaded in the Tower courtyard below. 
   <p>Another record of the fertility of the Ely Place garden will be found in the fact that when, to please Elizabeth, Bishop Cox leased the gatehouse and garden to her favourite, Sir Christopher Hatton, for a quit-rent of a red rose, <num value="10">ten</num> loads of hay, and <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> yearly, he retained the right not only of walking in the gardens, but of gathering <num value="20">twenty</num> bushels of roses yearly!   Sir Christopher Hatton expended a large sum   upon Ely Place, and petitioned Elizabeth to alienate to him the whole of the house and gardens. She immediately desired Bishop Cox to do so, but he refused, saying that <QUOTE>in his conscience he could not do it, being a piece of sacrilege;</QUOTE> that he was intrusted with the property of the see <QUOTE>to be a steward, and not a scatterer.</QUOTE> The Bishop was, however, eventually obliged to consent to the alienation of the property to Sir Christopher till all the money he had expended upon Ely Place should be repaid by the see. It was when the Queen found his successor, Dr. Martin Heton, unwilling to fulfil these terms, that she addressed to him her characteristic note- 
   <p><QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Proud Prelate!

The money which Sir Christopher had expended upon Ely <pb id="p.199" n="199"> Place was borrowed from the Queen, and it was her demanding a settlement of their accounts which caused his death. <QUOTE>It broke his heart,</QUOTE> says Fuller, <QUOTE>that the queen, which seldom gave loans, and never forgave due debts, rigorously demanded the payment of some arrears which Sir Christopher did not hope to have remitted, and did only desire to have forborne: failing herein in his expectation, it went to his heart, and cast him into a mortal disease. The queen afterwards did endeavour what she could to recover him, bringing, as some say, cordial broths unto him with her own hands; but all would not do. There's no pulley can draw up a heart once cast down, though a queen herself should set her hand thereunto.</QUOTE> Sir Christopher died in Ely House, <datestruct VALUE="1591-09-20"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=20>20</day>, <year reg=1591>1591</year></datestruct>. His residence here gave a name to Hatton Garden, which now occupies a great part of the site of the gardens of Ely Place. Here the beautiful Lady Hatton, widow of Sir Christopher's nephew, was courted at the same time by Lord Bacon and Sir Edward Coke, the famous lawyer. She married the latter, but soon quarrelled with him   and refused him admittance to her house, with the same success with which she and her successors repelled the attempts of the Bishops of Ely to recover the whole of their property, though they retained the old buildings beyond the gateway, where Laney, Bishop of Ely, died in <datestruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct>-<num value="5">5</num>.

When he arrived, having walked from St. James's, <QUOTE>the King went up <pb id="p.210" n="210"> the stairs leading to the Long Gallery</QUOTE> of Henry VIII., and so to the west side of the palace.   In the <QUOTE>Horn Chamber</QUOTE> he was given up to the officers who held the warrant for his execution. Then he passed on to the <QUOTE>Cabinet Chamber,</QUOTE> looking upon Privy Garden.

Several of the Puritan clergy knocked at the door and offered to pray with him, but he said that they had prayed <hi rend=italics>against</hi> him too often for him to wish to pray with them in his last moments. Meanwhile, in a small distant room, Cromwell was signing the order to the executioner, and workmen were employed in breaking a passage through the west wall of the Banqueting House, that the warrant for the execution might be carried out which ordained it to be held <QUOTE>in the open street before Whitehall.</QUOTE>

   <p>It was from Whitehall that Queen Mary Beatrice made her escape on the night of <datestruct VALUE="1688-12-9"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=9>9</day>, <year reg=1688>1688</year></datestruct>. The adventure was confided to the Count de Lauzun and his friend M. de St. Victor:   gentleman of Avignon. The queen on that terrible evening vainly entreated to be allowed to remain and share the perils of her husband; he assured her that it was absolutely necessary that she should precede him, and that he would follow her in <num value="24">twenty-four</num> hours. The king and queen went to bed as usual to avoid suspicion, but rose soon after, when the queen put on a disguise provided by St. Victor. The royal pair then descended to the rooms of Madame de Labadie, where they found Lauzun, with the infant Prince James and his <num value="2">two</num> nurses. The king, turning to Lauzun, said, <QUOTE>I confide my queen and my son to your care: all must be hazarded to convey them with the utmost speed to France.</QUOTE> Lauzun then gave his hand to the queen to lead her away, and, followed by the <num value="2">two</num> nurses with the child, they crossed the Great Gallery, and descended by a back staircase and a postern gate to Privy Gardens. At the garden gate a coach was waiting, the queen entered with Lauzun, the nurses, and her child, who slept the whole time, St. Victor mounted by the coachman, and they drove to the <QUOTE>Horse Ferry</QUOTE> at. Westminster, where. a boat was waiting in which they crossed to Lambeth. <pb id="p.216" n="216"> 
   <p>On the   <num value="11">11th</num> the Dutch troops had entered London, and James, having commanded the gallant Lord Craven, who was prepared to defend the palace to the utmost, to draw   off the guard which   he commanded, escaped himself in a boat from the water-entrance of the palace at <num value="3">three</num> o'clock in the morning. At Feversham his flight was arrested, and he returned amid bonfires, bell-ringing, and every symptom   of joy from   the fickle populace. Once more he slept in Whitehall, but in the middle of the night was aroused by order of his son-in-law, and hurried forcibly down the river to Rochester, whence, on <datestruct VALUE="-12-23"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=23>23</day></datestruct>, he escaped to France.

Compton, Bishop of London, was waiting for her with a hackney coach, and she fled to his house in Aldersgate Street.

   <p>But the glories of Whitehall were now over; William III., occupied with his buildings at Hampton Court and Kensington, never cared to live there, and Mary doubtless stayed <pb id="p.217" n="217"> there as little as possible, feeling oppressed by the recollections of her youth spent there with an indulgent father whom she had cruelly wronged, and a stepmother whom she had once loved with sisterly as well as filial affection, and from whom she had parted with passionate grief on her marriage, only <num value="9">nine</num> years before. The Stone Gallery and the late apartments of the royal mistresses in Whitehall were burnt down in <datestruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>, and the whole edifice was almost totally destroyed by fire through the negligence of a Dutch maidservant in <datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>. 
    <p>The principal remaining fragment of the palace is the 
 <hi rend=italics>Banqueting House</hi> of Inigo Jones, from which Charles I. passed to execution. Built in the dawn of the style of  Wren, it is <num value="1">one</num> of the most grandiose examples of that style, and is perfect alike in symmetry and proportion.  That it has no entrance apparent at <num value="1">first</num> sight is due to the fact that it was only intended as a portion of a larger building. In the same way we must remember that the appearance of <num value="2">two</num> stories externally, while the whole is <num value="1">one</num> room, is due to the Banqueting House being only <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="4">four</num> intended blocks, of which <num value="1">one</num> was to be a chapel surrounded by galleries, and the other <num value="2">two</num> divided into <num value="2">two</num> tiers of apartments. The Banqueting House was turned into a chapel by George I., but has never been consecrated, and the aspect of a hall is retained by the ugly false red curtains which surround the interior of the building. It is called the <rs type=subject>Chapel Royal of Whitehall</rs>, is served by the chaplains of the sovereign, and is <num value="1">one</num> of the dreariest places of worship in London. The ceiling is still decorated with canvas pictures by Rubens (<datestruct value="1635--"><year reg="1635">1635</year></datestruct>) representing the apotheosis of James I. The painter received <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure> for <pb id="p.218" n="218"> these works.

   <p>To this chapel the <num value="7">Seven</num> Bishops came to return thanks immediately after their acquittal.

   <p>The <hi rend=italics>Weathercock</hi> on the north end of the Banqueting House is of historic interest, as having been placed there by James II., that he might watch from his chamber whether it was a wind which would bring the Dutch fleet to England.

<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Oh, but why does he stay behind?

    <p>The exterior of the Banqueting House has always been much studied by architects. A dirty little ragged chimneys-weeper was once found drawing its front in chalk upon the basement stones of the building itself, and begged with tears <pb id="p.219" n="219"> not to be exposed to his master. The gentleman who found him purchased his indentures and sent him   to Rome to study, and he lived to make a large fortune as Isaac Ware the architect.<NOTE id="n.219.1"><title>Builder</title>, <datestruct VALUE="1876-02-5"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg=5>5</day>, <year reg=1876>1876</year></datestruct>.</NOTE>

    <p>In a courtyard behind the Banqueting House is <num value="1">one</num> of our best London statues, that of James II. by Grinling  Gibbons.

   <p>The south side of Downing Street is formed by the magnificent pile of modern   Italian   buildings by Sir Gilbert Scott, erected   <datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>-<num value="73">73</num>, to include the <rs type=subject>Home Office</rs>, <rs type=subject>Foreign Office</rs>, <rs type=subject>Colonial Office</rs>, and <rs type=subject>East India Office.</rs>
The Foreign Office, presided over by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, is at the north-west corner of the building, with a grand staircase: cabinet councils are frequently held here. The Colonial Office, facing Parliament Street, is presided over by the Secretary of State for the <pb id="p.224" n="224"> Colonies. Lord Nelson and the Duke of Wellington had their only meeting in a waiting-room of the old building. The affairs of the India Office were formerly transacted in the East India House in Leadenhall Street, but were transferred to the Crown when the East India Company came to an end by Act of Parliament, <datestruct VALUE="1858-09-1"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1858>1858</year></datestruct>, and are now managed by a council of <num value="12">twelve</num> members under a Secretary of State. Facing Downing Street is the <hi rend=italics>Exchequer</hi>, so called from a <num value="4">four</num>-cornered table covered with parti-coloured cloth, which heralds call <hi rend=italics>chequy</hi>, round which the old court was held. 
   <p>The stately modern house with high roofs, on the left of Whitehall, is <rs type=subject>Montagu House</rs>,<NOTE id="n.224.1">Montagu House is not shown to the public.</NOTE> built in <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct> by the Duke of Buccleuch, upon the site of an old family mansion erected immediately after the Court had abandoned Whitehall. The house contains some magnificent Vandykes and <num value="1">one</num> of the noblest collections of <hi rend=italics>Historical Miniatures</hi> in England, beautifully arranged in large frames on the walls of the principal rooms. The important English miniatures begin with Henry VIII., Catherine of Arragon, Catherine Howard, and those who surrounded them. Elizabeth is represented over and over again, with almost all the leading characters of her age.   The Stuart Kings follow, with their wives, mistresses, courtiers, and the chief literary men of their time; and the reigns of the Georges are represented with equal completeness. Many cases are devoted to the Foreign miniatures, of which most are French, and belong to the reigns of Louis XIV., XV., and XVI.     Amongst the pictures especially deserving notice are-

<p>The <num value="1">first</num> church on this site was built on the Isle of Thorns-- <QUOTE>Thorney Island</QUOTE> --an almost insulated peninsula of dry sand and gravel, girt on <num value="1">one</num> side by the Thames, and on the other by the marshes formed by the little stream Eye,<NOTE id="n.228.1">The Eye, now a sewer, still passes under New Bond Street, the Green Park, and Buckingham Palace, to join the Thames near Vauxhall Bridge,</NOTE> which gave its name to Tyburn, before it fell into the river.   Here Sebert, King of the East Saxons, who died in <num value="616">616</num>, having been baptized by Mellitus, is said to have founded a church, which he dedicated to St. Peter, either from an association with the great church in Rome, from   which Augustine had lately come, or to balance his rival foundation in honour of St. Paul upon a neighbouring hill.   Sulcard, the <num value="1">first</num> historian of the Abbey, relates that on a Sunday night, being the eve of the day on which the church was to be consecrated by Bishop Mellitus, Edric the fisherman was watching his nets by the bank of the island. On the opposite shore he saw a gleaming light, and, when he approached it in his boat, he found a venerable man, who desired to be ferried across the stream. Upon their arrival at the island, the <pb id="p.229" n="229"> mysterious stranger landed, and proceeded to the church, calling up on his way <num value="2">two</num> springs of water, which still exist, by <num value="2">two</num> blows of his staff. Then a host of angels miraculously appeared, and held candles which lighted him as he went through all the usual forms of a church consecration, while throughout the service other angels were seen ascending and descending over the church, as in Jacob's vision. When the old man returned to the boat, he bade Edric tell Mellitus that the church was already consecrated by St. Peter, who held the keys of heaven, and promised that a plentiful supply of fish would never fail him as a fisherman if he ceased to work on a Sunday, and did not forget to bear a tithe of that which he caught to the Abbey of Westminster. 
    <p>On the following day, when Mellitus came to consecrate the church, Edric presented himself and told his story, showing, in proof of it, the marks of consecration in the traces of the chrism, the crosses on the doors, and the droppings of the angelic candles. The bishop acknowledged that his work had been already done by saintly hands, and changed the name of the place from Thorney to Westminster, and in recollection of the story of Edric a tithe of fish was paid by the Thames fishermen to the Abbey till  <datestruct value="1382"><year reg="1382">1382</year></datestruct>,<NOTE id="n.229.1">In <datestruct value="1231--"><year reg="1231">1231</year></datestruct> the monks of Westminster went to law with the vicar of Rotherhithe for the tithe of salmon caught in his parish, protesting that it had been granted by St. Peter to their Abbey at its consecration.-<hi rend=italics>Flete</hi>.</NOTE> the bearer having a right to sit that day at the prior's table, and to ask for bread and ale from the cellarman. 
   <p>Beside the church of Sebert arose the palace of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs, to which it served as a chapel, as <pb id="p.230" n="230"> St. George's does to Windsor. It is connected with many of the legends of that picturesque age. Here, while he was attending mass with Leofric of Mercia and his wife, the famous Godiva, Edward the Confessor announced that he saw the Saviour appear as a luminous child. By the wayside between the palace and the chapel sate Michael, the crippled Irishman, who assured Hugolin, the chamberlain, that St. Peter had promised his cure if the king would himself bear him   on his shoulders to the church, upon which Edward bore him to the altar, where he was received by Godric, the sacristan, and walked away whole. 
   <p>Whilst he was an exile Edward had vowed that if he returned to England in safety he would make a pilgrimage to Rome. This promise, after his coronation, he was most anxious to perform, but his nobles refused to let him go, and the pope (Leo IX.) released him from his vow, on condition of his founding or restoring a church in honour of St. Peter. Then, to an ancient hermit near Worcester, St. Peter appeared, <QUOTE>bright and beautiful, like to a clerk,</QUOTE> and bade him tell the king that the church to which he must devote himself, and where he must establish a Benedictine monastery, was no other than the ancient minster of Thorney, which he knew so well. 
   <p>Edward, henceforth devoting a <num value="10">tenth</num> of his whole substance to the work, destroyed the old church, and rebuilt it from the foundation, as the <QUOTE>Collegiate Church of St. Peter at Westminster.</QUOTE> It was the <num value="1">first</num> cruciform church erected in England,<NOTE id="n.230.1"><QUOTE lang=la>Novo compositionis genere.</QUOTE>--<hi rend=italics>Matthew Paris.</hi></NOTE> and was of immense size for the age, covering the whole of the ground occupied by the present building.   The foundation was laid in <datestruct value="1049--"><year reg="1049">1049</year></datestruct>, and the <pb id="p.231" n="231"> church was consecrated <datestruct VALUE="1065-12-28"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1065>1065</year></datestruct>, <num value="8">eight</num> days before the death of the king.   Of this church and monastery of the Confessor nothing remains now but the Chapel of the Pyx, the lower part of the Refectory underlying the Westminster schoolroom, part of the Dormitory, and the whole of the lower walls of the South Cloister; but the Bayeux tapestry still shows us in outline the church of the Confessor as it existed in its glory. 
   <p>The <num value="2">second</num> founder of the Abbey was Henry III., who pulled down most of the Confessor's work, and from <datestruct value="1245--"><year reg="1245">1245</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1272--"><year reg="1272">1272</year></datestruct> devoted himself to rebuilding. The material he employed was <num value="1">first</num> the green sandstone, which has given the name of God-stone to the place in Surrey whence it came, and afterwards Caen stone.   The portions which remain to us from his time are the Confessor's Chapel, the side aisles and their chapels, and the choir and transepts.  The work of Henry was continued by his son Edward I., who built the eastern portion of the nave, and it was carried on by different abbots till the great west window was erected by Abbot Estney in <datestruct value="1498--"><year reg="1498">1498</year></datestruct>. Meantime, Abbot Littlington, in <datestruct value="1380--"><year reg="1380">1380</year></datestruct>, had added the College Hall, the Abbot's House,  Jerusalem Chamber, and part of the cloisters.   In <datestruct value="1502--"><year reg="1502">1502</year></datestruct>  Henry VII. pulled down the Lady Chapel, and built his beautiful Perpendicular chapel instead.   The western towers were only completed from designs of Sir Christopher  Wren (<datestruct value="1714--"><year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct>), under whom   much of the   exterior was refaced with Oxfordshire stone, and its original details mercilessly defaced and pared down.

The common allegorical materials of other monuments are here.   Even History is inscribing a conceit-she has written John, Duke of Argyle and Gr--there she pauses and weeps.

--the aisles surrounding   the choir, outside which are a number of hexagonal chapels, which were probably built by Henry III. in imitation of those which he had   himself seen in the course of construction in several of the northern cathedrals of France.     These chapels contain all that is most precious in the Abbey. The gates of the choir-aisles are guarded by vergers. 
<p>[The chapels are freely opened to the public on Mondays; on other days a fee of sixpence is deposited on entering, and visitors are shown round by a verger.

   <p>Permission to draw in the chapels may be obtained by personal or <pb id="p.252" n="252"> written application to the Dean; and no church in the world--not even St. Mark's at Venice, St. Stephen's at Vienna, or the Mosque at Cordova-affords such picturesque subjects.

    <p>It is said that on looking back from the portico of Henry  VII.'s Chapel, every phase of Gothic architecture, from  Henry III. to Henry VII., may be seen.   The glorious brass gates are adorned with all the badges of the founder--the fleur-de-lis, the portcullis and crown, the falcon and fetterlock, the thistle and crown, the united roses of York and Lancaster entwined with the crown, the initials R. H., the royal crown, and the <num value="3">three</num> lions of England.. The devices of Henry VII. are also borne by the angels sculptured on the frieze at the west end of the chapel. The windows have traces of the white roses of Lancaster and of the fleur-de-lis and H&rsquo;s with which they were once filled; from the end window the figure of Henry VII. looks down upon the whole.   <num value="73">Seventy-three</num> statues, whose <QUOTE>natural simplicity and grandeur of character and drapery</QUOTE> are greatly commended by Flaxman, surround the walls. 
   <p><QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE> The very walls are wrought into universal ornament, encrusted with tracery, and scooped into niches, crowded with statues of saints and martyrs.

   <p>The stalls of the Knights of the Bath surround the chapel, with the seats for the esquires in front. The end stall on the right is decorated with a figure of Henry VII. The sculptures on the misereres are exceedingly quaint, chiefly monkish satires on the evil lives of their brethren. Amongst them are combats between monks and nuns, a monk seized <pb id="p.266" n="266"> and a monk carried off by the devil, <num value="1">one</num> boy whipping another, apes gathering nuts, and a fox in armour riding a goose. The best is the Judgment of Solomon; the cause of the contention--the substitution of the dead for the living child--is represented with ludicrous simplicity, repeated on either side of the bracket.

   <p>This chapel, more than any other part of the Abbey, remains as it was left by its <num value="2">second</num> founder, Henry III. He made it a Holy of Holies to contain the shrine of his <pb id="p.289" n="289"> sainted predecessor.   For this he moved the high altar westward, and made the choir project far down into the nave, like the <hi rend=italics>coro</hi> of a Spanish cathedral; for this he raised behind the high altar a mound of earth, <QUOTE>the last funeral tumulus in England.</QUOTE>   For this he imported from Rome

   <p>Edward the Confessor died in the opening days of <datestruct value="1066--"><year reg="1066">1066</year></datestruct>, when his church at Westminster had just been consecrated in the presence of Edith his queen. He was buried before the high altar with his crown upon his head, a golden chain and crucifix around his neck, and his pilgrim's ring upon his finger. Thus he was seen when his coffin was opened by Henry I. in the presence of Bishop Gundulf, who tried to steal a hair from his white beard. Thus he was again seen by Henry II., in whose reign he was transferred by Archbishop Becket to a new and <QUOTE>precious feretry,</QUOTE> just after his canonization (<datestruct VALUE="1161-02-7"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg=7>7</day>, <year reg=1161>1161</year></datestruct>) by Pope Alexander III., who enjoined <QUOTE>that his body be honoured here on earth, as his soul is glorified in heaven.</QUOTE> Henry III. also looked upon the <QUOTE>incorrupt</QUOTE> body, before its translation to its present resting-place, on the shoulders of the royal Plantagenet princes, whose own sepulchres were afterwards to gather around it. The body lies in a stone coffin, iron-bound, within the shrine of marble and mosaic. It appears from <pb id="p.290" n="290"> an illumination in the <title>Life of St. Edward</title> in the University Library at Cambridge that, after his canonization, <num value="1">one</num> end of the shrine was for some time left open, that sick persons might creep through and touch the coffin. The <num value="7">seven</num> recesses at the sides of the shrine were intended for pilgrims to kneel under. The inlaid wooden wainscoting on the top was added by Abbot Feckenham in the reign of Mary I., by whom the shrine was restored, for it had been partially, if not wholly, displaced at the Dissolution. Before that it probably had a Gothic canopy. At the coronation of James II. both shrine and coffin were broken by the fall of some scaffolding. It was then robbed for the last time. Henry Keepe, who wrote the <title>Monumenta Westmonasteriensia,</title> relates that he himself put in his hand and drew forth the chain and crucifix of the Confessor, which were accepted by the last of the Stuart kings. The shrine, which was <num value="1">one</num> of the most popular points of pilgrimage before the Reformation, is still the object of pilgrimages with Roman Catholics.

<div1 type="chapter" n="7" id="c.7"><HEAD>Chapter VII:  Westminster Abbey.-II</HEAD>
 
<p>We now enter the <hi rend=italics>North Transept</hi> of the Abbey, of which the great feature is the beautiful rose-window (restored <datestruct value="1722--"><year reg="1722">1722</year></datestruct>), <num value="32">thirty-two</num> feet in diameter. This transept was utterly uninvaded by monuments till the Duke of Newcastle was buried here <num value="200">two hundred</num> years ago. Since then it has become the favourite burial-place of admirals, and since Pitt, Earl of Chatham, was laid here in <datestruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct>, the central aisle has been 
<QUOTE>appropriated to statesmen, as the other transept by poets.</QUOTE>
The whole character of the monuments is now changed; while the earlier tombs are intended to recall <hi rend=italics>Death</hi> to the mind, the memorials of the last <num value="2">two</num> centuries are entirely devoted to the exaltation of the <hi rend=italics>Life</hi> of the person commemorated.   In this transept, especially, the entire space between the grey arches is filled by huge monuments groaning under pagan sculpture of offensive enormity, emulating the tombs of the Popes in St. Peter's in their size, and curious as proving how taste is changed by showing the popularity which such sculptors as Nollekens, Scheemakers, and Bacon long enjoyed in England. Through the remainder of the Abbey the monuments, often interesting from their associations, are in themselves chiefly remarkable <pb id="p.322" n="322"> for their utter want of originality and variety. Justice and Temperance, Prudence and   Mercy, are for ever busy propping up the tremendous masses of masonry upon which Britannia, Fame, and Victory are perpetually seen crowning a bust, an urn, or a rostral column with their wreaths; while beneath these piles sit figures indicative of the military or naval professions of the deceased, plunged in idiotic despair. As we continue our walk through the church we descend gradually but surely, after we leave the fine conceptions and graphic portraiture of Roubiliac and Rysbrack. Even Bacon and Flaxman are weighed down by the pagan mania for Neptunes, Britannias, and Victorys, and only rise to anything like nobility in the single figures of Chatham   and Mansfield.   The abundant works of Chantrey and Westmacott in the Abbey are, with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> exceptions, monotonous and commonplace. But it is only when utterly wearied by the platitudes of Nollekens or Cheere,<NOTE id="n.322.1">It would scarcely be believed from his works that Cheere was the master of Roubiliac.</NOTE> that we appreciate what lower depths of degradation sculpture has reached in the once admired works of Taylor and Nathaniel Read and in most of the works of Bird. 
   <p>When he came back from Rome and saw his works in Westminster Abbey, Roubiliac exclaimed, <QUOTE>By God I my own work looks to me as meagre and starved, as if made of nothing but tobacco-pipes.</QUOTE>

   <p>The <hi rend=italics>Chapter House</hi> of Westminster, which is the largest in England except that of Lincoln, was built by Henry III. in <datestruct value="1250--"><year reg="1250">1250</year></datestruct>, upon the ancient crypt of the Chapter House of Edward the Confessor. Matthew   Paris (<datestruct value="1250--"><year reg="1250">1250</year></datestruct>) says of Henry III., <QUOTE lang=la>Dominus Rex aedificavit capitulum incomparabile,</QUOTE> and at the time it was built there was nothing to be compared to it.

   <p>Here the monks, at least once a week, assembled to hold their chapters, in which all the affairs of the monastery were discussed. The abbot and the <num value="4">four</num> chief officers took their seats in the ornamented stalls opposite the entrance, the monks on the stone benches round. In front of the stalls criminals were tried, and, if found guilty, were publicly flogged against the central pillar of Purbeck marble (<num value="35">35</num> ft. high), which was used as a whipping-post. 
   <p>But the monks had not sole possession of the Chapter House, for, as early as <datestruct value="1282"><year reg="1282">1282</year></datestruct>, when the Houses of Lords and Commons were separated, the House of Commons began to hold its sittings here, and for <num value="300">three hundred</num> years it continued to hold them, sometimes in the Refectory, but generally in the Chapter House. This chamber has therefore witnessed the principal acts which have been the foundation of the civil and religious liberties of England. <pb id="p.349" n="349"> The Speaker probably occupied the abbot's stall, and the members the benches of the monks and the floor of the house.

Here also, perhaps, Francis Atterbury, the most eminent of the Westminster deans--the furious Jacobite who, on the death of Queen Anne, prepared to go in lawn sleeves to proclaim James III. at Charing Cross--entered into those plots for which he was sent to the Tower and exiled. 
   <p>During the Commonwealth the Deanery was leased to <pb id="p.361" n="361"> John Bradshaw, President of the High Court of Justice. He died in the Deanery and was buried in the Abbey. 
   <p>On the other side of the picturesque little court in front of the Deanery is the Abbot's Refectory, now the <hi rend=italics>College Hall</hi>, where the Westminster scholars dine. Till the time of Dean Buckland (<datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>-<num value="56">56</num>) the hall was only warmed by a brazier, of which the smoke escaped through the louvre in the roof. The huge tables of chestnut-wood are said to have been presented by Elizabeth from the wrecks of the Spanish Armada.   Here probably it was--in the <QUOTE>Abbot's Place</QUOTE> --that the widowed   queen   Elizabeth Woodville (<datestruct VALUE="1485-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1485">1485</year></datestruct>), crossing over from the neighbouring palace, took refuge with Abbot Esteney while the greater security of the Sanctuary was being prepared for her. Here she sate on the niches, <QUOTE>all desolate and dismayed,</QUOTE> with her long fair hair, which had escaped from its confinement in her distress, sweeping upon the ground. 
   <p>Through the little court of the Deanery is the approach to <hi rend=italics>Jerusalem Chamber</hi>, built by Abbot Littlington between <datestruct value="1376--"><year reg="1376">1376</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1386--"><year reg="1386">1386</year></datestruct> as a guest-chamber for the Abbot's House. It probably derived its after-name from tapestry pictures of the History of Jerusalem with which it was hung. Here, in the ancient chamber where Convocation now holds its meetings, Henry IV. died of apoplexy, <datestruct VALUE="1413-03-20"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=20>20</day>, <year reg=1413>1413</year></datestruct>, thus fulfilling the prophecy that he should die in Jerusalem.

   <p>The chief existing decorations of this beautiful old chamber are probably due to Dean Williams in the-time of James I., but the painted glass is more ancient. The panelling is of cedar-wood.

    <p>From the Deanery a low archway leads into <hi rend=italics>Dean's Yard</hi>, once called <QUOTE>The Elms,</QUOTE> from   its grove of trees.   The eastern side was formerly occupied by the houses of the  Prior, Sub-Prior, and other officers of the  Convent, which still in part remain   as houses   of the   Canons.

   <p>In the green space in the centre of the yard an exhibition of <QUOTE>the results of Window Gardening</QUOTE> takes place every summer, exceedingly popular with the poorer inhabitants of Westminster, and often productive of much innocent pleasure through the rest of the year. 
   <p>On the east is a beautiful vaulted passage and picturesque gate of Abbot Littlington's time, leading to the groined entrance of <hi rend=italics>Little Dean's Yard</hi>. The tower above the gate is probably that which is known as <QUOTE>the Blackstole Tower.</QUOTE> On the other side of the yard is a classic gateway, the design of which is attributed to Inigo Jones, now covered with names of scholars, which forms the entrance to 
<hi rend=italics>Westminster School</hi>, originally founded by Henry VIII., and richly endowed by Queen Elizabeth in <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>. The <hi rend=italics>Schoolroom</hi> can be best visited between <num value="2">2</num> and <num value="3">3</num> P.M.

At the south-western extremity <num value="2">two</num> round arches of the Confessor's time remain, with the door which led by a staircase to the cloisters. On the opposite side is another arched window, and a door which led to Abbot Littlington's Tower. 
    <p>In its present form   the Schoolroom   is a noble and venerable chamber. The timber roof is of oak, not chestnut as generally represented.   The upper part of the walls and the recesses of the windows are covered with <pb id="p.365" n="365"> names of scholars.   Formerly the benches followed the lines of the walls as in the old <QUOTE><num value="4">Fourth</num> Form   Room</QUOTE> at Harrow; the present horseshoe arrangement of benches was introduced from   the Charter House by Dean Liddell (who had been   a Charter House boy) when he was head-master.   The half circle marked in the floor of the dais recalls the semicircular form   of the   end   of the room, which existed till <datestruct value="1868"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>, and which gave the name of <QUOTE>shell</QUOTE> (adopted by several other public schools) to the class which occupied that position. The old <QUOTE>shell-forms,</QUOTE> the most venerable of the many ancient benches here, hacked and carved with names till scarce any of the original surface remains, are preserved in a small class-room on the left. In a similar room on the right is a form which bears the name of Dryden, cut in narrow   capital letters.   The school-hours are from <num value="8">eight</num> to <num value="9">nine</num>, <num value="10">ten</num> to half-past <num value="12">twelve</num>, and half-past <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="5">five</num>. 
   <p>High up, across the middle of the Schoolroom, an iron bar divides the Upper and Lower Schools.   Over this bar, by an ancient custom, the college cook or her deputy tosses a stiffly-made Pancake on Shrove Tuesday.   The boys, on the other side of the bar, struggle to catch it, and if any boy can not only catch it but convey it away intact from all competitors to the head-master's house (a difficult feat) he can claim a guinea. In former days a curtain, hanging from this bar, separated the schools. 
   <QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE><p>Every <num value="1">one</num>, who is acquainted with Westminster-school, knows that there is a curtain which used to be drawn across the room, to separate the upper school from the lower. A youth (Wake, father of Archbishop Wake) happened, by some mischance, to tear the above-mentioned curtain. The severity of the master (Dr. Busby) was too well known for the criminal to expect any pardon for such a fault; so that <pb id="p.366" n="366"> the boy, who was of a meek temper, was terrified to death at the thoughts of his appearance, when his friend who sate next to him bade him be of good cheer, for that he would take the fault on himself.

By the answer, he was soon convinced that it was his former generous friend; and without saying anything more at that time, made the best of his way to London, where employing all his power and interest with the protector, he saved his friend from the fate of his unhappy associates.</QUOTE><BIBL>--<hi rend=italics>Spectator</hi>, No. <num value="313">313</num>.</BIBL></CIT></QUOTE>

    <p>On the north of Little Dean's Yard, occupying the site of part of the monastic building known as <QUOTE>the Misericorde,</QUOTE> is <hi rend=italics>Ashburnham House</hi> (now the residence of the Sub-Dean), built by Inigo Jones, which derives its name from having been the residence of Lord Ashburnham in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>.

The house has a broad noble staircase, with a quaint circular gallery above and the ceiling and decorations of the <pb id="p.368" n="368"> drawingroom are beautiful specimens of Inigo Jones's work: a small temple-summer-house in the garden is also, but without much probability, attributed to him.   Dean Milman resided in this house as Canon of Westminster. 
   <p>The precincts of the Monastery extended far beyond those of the College and were entered (where the Royal Aquarium now stands) by a double Gatehouse of the time of Edward III., which served also as a gaol.   <num value="1">One</num> of its chambers was used as an ecclesiastical prison, the other was the common prison of Westminster, the prisoners being brought by way of Thieving Lane and Union Street, to prevent their escaping by entering the liberties of sanctuary.

 fled hither to sanctuary from Cardinal Wolsey in the time of Henry VIII., and remained here till his death, not all the Cardinal's influence having power to dislodge him. After the fall of the Abbey criminals were deprived of the rights of sanctuary, but they were retained for debtors till the time of James I. (<datestruct value="1602--"><year reg="1602">1602</year></datestruct>), when they were finally abolished. 
   <p>Within the precincts, to the right on passing the Gatehouse (where the Westminster Palace Hotel now stands), was the <hi rend=italics>Almonry</hi>, possessing an   endowment for male pensioners from   Henry VII., and for females from   his mother, the Countess of Richmond.   <num value="2">Two</num> chapels were connected with it, <num value="1">one</num> of which was commemorated in the name of <hi rend=italics>St. Annes Lane</hi>.   It was in the Almonry that William Caxton's printing-press was established.

was produced, which is generally supposed to have been his <num value="1">first</num> work printed in this country.   Gower's <title>Confessio Amantis </title> and Chaucer's different poems were printed here by Caxton. 
   <p>We have still left <num value="1">one</num> interesting point unvisited which <pb id="p.372" n="372"> is connected with the Abbey. Beyond the Infirmary Garden were the cell of the Hermit, who, by ancient custom, was attached to the Abbey, and the ancient tower which formerly served as the <hi rend=italics>King's Jewel House</hi>. The latter remains. Its massive rugged walls and narrow Norman windows are best seen from the mews in College Street, entered by the gateway on the south of Dean's Yard. But to visit the interior it is necessary to ask admission at <num value="6">6</num>, Old Palace Yard. The tower has been generally described as a building of Richard II., but it was more probably only bought by him, and it is most likely that it was <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest portions of the Abbey, and contained the primitive Refectory and Dormitory used by the monks during the building of the principal edifice by the Confessor. A layer of Roman tiles has been discovered in the building. 
   <p>The interior was evidently refitted by Abbot Littlington, and the exceedingly beautiful vaulted room on the basement story is of his time. The bosses of the roof are curious, especially <num value="1">one</num> with a face on every side. A small vaulted room opens out of the larger chamber. The upper chamber of the tower, which has its noble original chestnut roof, is now a small historical museum. Here are some of the old standards of weights and measures-those of Henry VII. being especially curious; the old Exchequer Tallies; Queen Elizabeth's Standard Ell and Yard, &amp;c. Here also are the <num value="6">six</num> horseshoes and <num value="61">sixty-one</num> nails which, by ancient custom, the sheriffs of London are compelled to count when they are sworn in. In the time of Edward II., when this custom was established, it was a proof of education, as only well-instructed men could count up to <num value="61">sixty-one</num>. At the same time it was ordained that the sheriff, in proof <pb id="p.373" n="373"> of strength, should cut a bundle of sticks: this custom (the abolition of which has been vainly attempted) still exists, but a bundle of matches (!) is now provided. The original knife always has to be used. 
   <p>There is a noble view of the Abbey from the platform   on the top of the Tower.   It will scarcely be credited by those who visit it, that the destruction of this interesting building is in contemplation, and that the present century, for the sake of making a <QUOTE>regular</QUOTE> street, will perhaps bear the stigma of having destroyed <num value="1">one</num> of the most precious buildings in Westminster, which, if the houses around it were cleared away (and it were preserved as a museum of Westminster antiquities), would be the greatest possible addition to the group of historic buildings to which it belongs. <pb id="p.374" n="374">

<p>Immediately facing us as we emerge from Parliament Street is New Palace Yard, backed by Westminster Hall and the New Houses of Parliament. They occupy the site of the palace inhabited by the ancient sovereigns of England from early Anglo-Saxon times till Henry VIII. went to reside at Whitehall. Here they lived in security under the shadow of the great neighbouring sanctuary, and <num value="1">one</num> after another saw arise, within the walls of their Palace, those Houses of Parliament which have now swallowed up the whole. It was here that Edward the Confessor entertained the Norman cousin who was to succeed him, and here he died on the <datestruct VALUE="1066-01-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1066">1066</year></datestruct>. The palace was frequently enlarged and beautified afterwards, especially by William Rufus, who built the hall; by Stephen, who built the chapel, to which the finishing touches were given by Edward III.; and by Henry VIII., who built the Star Chamber.   Edward I. was born, and Edward IV. died, within the walls of the palace. The most interesting parts of the ancient building were St. Stephen's Chapel, the Painted Chamber, and the Star Chamber. 
   <p>St. Stephen's Chapel was a beautiful specimen of rich <pb id="p.375" n="375"> Decorated Gothic, its inner walls being covered with ancient frescoes relating to the Old and New Testament history; it was used as the House of Commons from   <datestruct value="1547--"><year reg="1547">1547</year></datestruct> till <datestruct value="1834"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, and its, walls resounded to the eloquence of Chatham, Pitt, Fox, Burke, Grattan, and Canning. 
   <p>The walls of the Painted Chamber were pointed out by tradition as those of the bedroom   where the Confessor died. It was <num value="1">first</num> called St. Edward's Chamber, and took its <num value="2">second</num> name from the frescoes (arranged round the walls in bands like the Bayeux tapestry) with which it was adorned by Henry III., and which were chiefly illustrative of the History of the Maccabees and the Legendary life of the Confessor.<NOTE id="n.375.1">They are engraved in J. T. Smith's <title>Vetusta Monumenta.</title></NOTE>   Here conferences between the Lords and Commons took place; here the High Court of Justice sate for the trial of Charles I.; and here the king's death-warrant was signed in the disgraceful scene when Cromwell and Henry Marten inked each other's faces. It was here also that Cromwell's daughter Elizabeth Claypole lay in state, and, long afterwards, Lord Chatham   and William Pitt. 
    <p>The Star Chamber, which was rebuilt by Henry VIII., took its name from the gilt stars upon its ceiling. It was the terrible Court in which the functions of Prosecutor and  Judge were confounded, and where every punishment except death   could   be inflicted-imprisonment, pillory, branding, whipping, &amp;c. It was there that William, Bishop of Lincoln, was fined <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure> for calling Laud <QUOTE>the great  Leviathan,</QUOTE> and that John Lilburn, after being fined  <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure>, was sentenced to the pillory, and to he whipped from Fleet Street to Westminster. On the south side of the <pb id="p.376" n="376"> palace was the Chapel of Our Lady de la Pieu (des Puits?) where Richard II. offered to the Virgin before going to meet Wat Tyler. It was burnt in <datestruct value="1452--"><year reg="1452">1452</year></datestruct>, but rebuilt by the brother of Elizabeth Woodville, Anthony, Earl Rivers, who left his heart to be buried there. 
   <p>At the end of the old Palace, opening upon Old Palace Yard, was the Prince's Chamber, built upon foundations of the Confessor's time, with walls <num value="7">seven</num> feet thick. The upper part had lancet windows of the time of Henry III., and beneath them the quaintest of tapestry represented the birth of Elizabeth. Beyond was the ancient Court of Requests, hung with very curious tapestry representing the defeat of the Armada, woven at Haarlem, from designs of Cornelius Vroom for Lord Howard of Effingham. This was the House of Lords till <datestruct value="1834"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>. Its interior is shown in Copley's Picture of the <title>Death of Lord Chatham,</title> who was attacked by his last illness (<datestruct VALUE="1779-04-7"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=7>7</day>, <year reg=1779>1779</year></datestruct>) while declaiming against the disgrace of the proposed motion <QUOTE>for recognising the independence of the North American colonies.</QUOTE> Beneath was the cellar where Guy Fawkes concealed (<datestruct VALUE="1605-11-5"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=5>5</day>, <year reg=1605>1605</year></datestruct>) the barrels of gunpowder by which the king, queen, and peers were to be blown up. Hither, on the day before the opening of Parliament, Lady Aveland, as Hereditary Lord High Chamberlain, comes annually, by her deputy, with torches, to hunt for the successors of Guy Fawkes. On the night of <datestruct VALUE="1834-10-16"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=16>16</day>, <year reg=1834>1834</year></datestruct>, occurred the great conflagration which was painted by Turner, and the ancient Palace of Westminster, with St. Stephen's Chapel, and the old House of Lords were entirely gutted by fire.<NOTE id="n.376.1">The fire began in the rooms adjacent to the House of Lords, amid the piles of tallies which were preserved there-pieces of stick upon which the primitive accounts of the House were kept by notches.</NOTE>

It is twice the size of the old palace, and is <num value="1">one</num> of the largest  Gothic buildings in the world. The exterior is constructed of magnesian   lime-stone from   the Yorkshire quarries   of  Anston; the interior is of Caen   stone.

But while he was under sentence of death, an affidavit was made by several persons that the clock actually did strike <num value="13">thirteen</num> instead of <num value="12">twelve</num>, whereupon he received the king's pardon.</NOTE>   and the   <hi rend=italics>Victoria   Tower</hi> (<num value="75">75</num> feet square, and   <num value="336">336</num>   feet   high),   being   the    gateway   by which the Queen is intended to approach the House of  Lords.   Over the arch of the gate is the statue of Queen  Victoria, supported by figures of Justice and Mercy; at the sides her parents, the Duke and Duchess of Kent, are commemorated, and other members of her family.

   <p>On Westminster Hall 
   <QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE><p>Ireton's head was in the middle, and Cromwell's and Bradshaw's on either side. Cromwell's head, being embalmed, remained exposed to the atmosphere for <num value="25">twenty-five</num> years, and then <num value="1">one</num> stormy night it was blown down, and picked up by the sentry, who, hiding it under his cloak, took it home and secreted it in the chimney-corner, and, as enquiries were constantly being made about it by the Government, it was only on his deathbed that he revealed where he had hidden it. His family sold the head to <num value="1">one</num> of the Cambridgeshire Russells, and, in the same box in which it still is, it descended to a certain Samuel Russell, who, being a needy and careless man, exhibited it in a place near Clare Market. There it was seen by James Cox, who then owned a famous museum. He tried in vain to buy the head from Russell; for, poor as he was, nothing would at <num value="1">first</num> tempt him to part with the relic, but after a time Cox assisted him with money, and eventually, to clear himself from debt, he made the head over to Cox. When Cox at last parted with his museum, he sold the head of Cromwell for <measure value="230l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="230">230</num></measure> to <num value="3">three</num> men, who bought it about the time of the French Revolution to exhibit in Mead Court, Bond Street, at half a crown a head. Curiously enough, it happened that each of these <num value="3">three</num> gentlemen died a sudden death, and the head came into the possession of the <num value="3">three</num> nieces of the last man who died. These young ladies, nervous at keeping it in the house, asked Mr. Wilkinson, their medical man, to take care of it for them, and they subsequently sold it to him. For the next <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> years Mr. Wilkinson was in the habit of <pb id="p.379" n="379"> showing it to all the distinguished men of that day, and the head, much treasured, remains in the family. 
   <p>The circumstantial evidence is very curious. It is the only head in history which is known to have been embalmed and afterwards beheaded. On the back of the neck, above the vertebrae, is the mark of the cut of an axe where the executioner, having, perhaps, no proper block, had struck too high, and, laying the head in its soft embalmed state on the block, flattened the nose on <num value="1">one</num> side, making it adhere to the face. The hair grows promiscuously about the face, and the beard, stained to exactly the same colour by the embalming liquor, is tucked up under the chin with the oaken staff of the spear with which the head was stuck upon Westminster Hall, which staff is perforated by a worm that never attacks oak until it has been for many years exposed to the weather. The iron spear-head, where it protrudes above the skull, is rusted away by the action of the atmosphere. The jagged way in which the top of the skull is removed throws us back to a time when surgery was in its infancy, while the embalming is so beautifully done that the cellular process of the gums and the membrane of the tongue are still to be seen.</QUOTE><BIBL>-Letter signed &lsquo;Senex,&rsquo;

Here Edward III. received the Black Prince when he returned to England with King John of France as a prisoner after the Battle of Poitiers. Hither came the English barons with the Duke of Gloucester to denounce Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland, to Richard II.; and here, when Richard abdicated, Henry Bolingbroke claimed the realm of England as descended by right line of blood from Henry III.<NOTE id="n.383.1">Shakspeare in his <hi rend=italics>Richard II</hi>. makes the King pronounce his abdication at this scene.</NOTE>

   <p>Westminster Hall was the scene of all the Coronation banquets from the time of William Rufus to that of George IV.

   <p>The most important feature of the church is the east window, justly cited by Winston, the great authority on stained   glass, as the   most beautiful work as regards harmonious arrangement of colouring with which he is acquainted.   It was ordered by Ferdinand and Isabella to <pb id="p.394" n="394"> be executed at Gouda in Holland, and was intended as a gift to the new chapel which Henry VII. was building, upon the marriage of their daughter Catherine with his eldest son Arthur. But the execution of the window occupied <num value="5">five</num> years, and before it was finished Prince Arthur was dead, and the chapel was finished. Henry VIII. presented the window to Waltham Abbey, and thence, on the Dissolution, the last abbot sent it for safety to his private chapel at New Hall, an estate which was afterwards purchased by Sir Thomas Boleyn, father of Queen Anne. The window remained at New Hall till the place became the property of General Monk, who took down the window and buried it, to preserve it from the Puritans, but replaced it in his chapel at the Restoration. After his death the chapel was pulled down, but the window was preserved and was eventually purchased by Mr. Conyers of Copt Hall in Essex, by whose son it was sold in <datestruct value="1758--"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct> to the churchwardens of St. Margaret's for <measure value="400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400">400</num></measure>.<NOTE id="n.394.1">Timbs's <title>Curiosities of London.</title></NOTE>   Even then the window was not suffered to rest in peace, as the Dean and Chapter of Westminster looked upon it as <QUOTE>a superstitious image and picture,</QUOTE> and brought a lawsuit for its removal, which, after having been fought for <num value="7">seven</num> years, happily failed in the end.<NOTE id="n.394.2">In memory of this triumph the then churchwarden presented to the parish the beautiful <title>Loving Cup of St. Margaret.</title></NOTE>

Of such a character, which the dull overlook, and the gay despise, it was fit that the value should be made known, and the dignity established.

Its pillars have been buried nearly up to their capitals, to prevent the rising of the river tides within its walls.

   <p>The screen, erected by Laud, was suffered to survive the Commonwealth.   At the west end of the chapel, high on the wall, projects a Gothic confessional, erected by Archbishop Chicheley.

The beautiful western door of the chapel opens into the curious <hi rend=italics>Post Room</hi>, which takes its name from the central wooden pillar, supposed to have been used as a whipping-post for the Lollards. The ornamented flat ceiling which we see here is extremely rare.   The door at the north-east corner, by which the Lollards were brought in, was walled up c. <datestruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>.

The winding staircase, of rude slabs of unplaned oak, on which the bark in many cases remains, is of Chicheley's time.

The rough-hewn boards bear many fragments of inscriptions which show that others besides Lollards were immured here. Some of them, especially his motto <QUOTE lang=la>Nosce te ipsum,</QUOTE> are attributed to Cranmer. The most legible inscription is <QUOTE>IHS cyppe me out of all al company.

Above some of the rings the boards are burnt with the hot-iron used in torture. The door has a wooden lock, and is fastened by the wooden pegs which preceded the use of nails; it is a relic of Archbishop Sudbury's palace facing the river, which was pulled down by Chicheley. From the roof of the chapel there is a noble view up the river, with the quaint tourelle of the Lollards' Tower in the foreground.

   <QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE>Let us look, for instance, at the list of the officers of Cranmer's household.

There were generally <num value="3">three</num> tables spread in the hall, and served at the same time, at the <num value="1">first</num> of which sat the archbishop, surrounded by peers of the realm, privy-councillors, and gentlemen of the greatest quality; at the <num value="2">second</num>, called the Almoner's table, sat the chaplains and all the other clerical guests below the rank of diocesan bishops and abbots; and at the <num value="3">third</num>, or Steward's table, sat all the other gentlemen invited.

The daily fragments thereof did suffice to fill the bellies of a great number of poor hungry people that waited at the gate; and so constant and unfailing was this provision at my  Lord's table, that whosoever came in either at dinner or supper, being not above the degree of a knight, might here be entertained worthy of his quality, either at the steward's or almoner's table. And moreover, it was the Archbishop's command to all his servants, that all strangers should be received and treated with all manner of civility and respect, and that places at the table should be assigned them according to their dignity and quality, which abounded much to the praise and commendation of the Archbishop. The discourse and conversation at meals <pb id="p.422" n="422"> was void of all brawls and loud talking, and for the most part consisted in framing men's manners to religion, or to some other honest and beseeming subject. There was a monitor of the hall; and if it happened that any spoke too loud, or concerning things less decent, it was presently hushed by <num value="1">one</num> that cried silence.

    <p>Ascending the Grosvenor Road we come to <rs type=subject>Chelsea</rs>, which, in the last century, from   a country village, has become almost a part of London. As regards the etymology of its name, formerly written Chelchyth, the opinion of Norden is generally followed, who says <QUOTE>that Chelsey was so called of the nature of the place, whose strand is like the <hi rend=italics>chesel</hi>, which the sea casteth up of sand and pebble stones.</QUOTE>

   <p>In the <hi rend=italics>Wards</hi> of the Hospital each pensioner has his own little oak chamber (where he may have his own pictures, books, &amp;c.), with a door and window opening upon the great common passage.

   <p>The <hi rend=italics>Hall</hi> (now used by the pensioners as a club-room, with tables for chess, cards, books, newspapers, &amp;c.) is hung with tattered colours taken by the British army. On the end wall is a vast picture by <hi rend=italics>Verrio</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Henry Cooke</hi>, given by the Earl of Ranelagh, with an equestrian figure of Charles II. in the centre. It was the figure of the orange-girl in the corner of this picture which gave rise to the now exploded tradition that the foundation of the Hospital was instigated by Nell Gwynne.   On the panels round the room the victories of Great Britain are recorded.

    <p>The <hi rend=italics>Chapel</hi> has a picturesqueness of its own, from   the mass of banners in every stage of decay, often only a few threads remaining, which wave from the coved roof, and fill the space at once with gloom and colour.

    <p>The <rs type=subject>Gardens of Chelsea Hospital</rs> (open to the public from <num value="10">10</num> A.M. to sunset) somewhat resemble those of the old French palaces. A pleasant avenue leads to the wide open space towards the river, in the centre of which an obelisk was erected in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct> in memory of the <num value="155">155</num> officers and privates who fell at Chilianwallah.   Hence the great red   front of the Hospital, black   under its overhanging eaves and high slated roof, with a narrow dome-capped portico in the centre, rises, rich in colour, beyond the green slopes. The eastern side of the gardens was once the famous <hi rend=italics>Ranelagh</hi>, which was opened, <datestruct value="1742--"><year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct>, as a rival to Vauxhall, and rose to great popularity under the patronage of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. <datestruct VALUE="1744-06-29"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=29>29</day>,  <year reg=1744>1744</year></datestruct>, Walpole writes, <QUOTE>Ranelagh has totally beat Vauxhall.

   <p>Another great resort near this was the <QUOTE>Old Chelsea <pb id="p.429" n="429"> Bun House,</QUOTE> a queer picturesque old house in Jew's Row, which had a marvellous popularity at all times, but especially on Good Friday, when as many as <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> persons came here to buy buns, and <num value="240000">two hundred and forty thousand</num> buns were sold.   George II. and Caroline of Anspach were fond of driving down to fetch their own buns, and the practice was continued by George III. and Queen Charlotte, which set the fashion with every <num value="1">one</num> else.

   <p>The <rs type=subject>Botanic Garden</rs> facing the river is the oldest garden of the kind in existence in England, Gerard's garden in Holborn and Tradescant's garden at Lambeth having perished. It was leased to the Apothecaries' Company, who still possess it, by Lord Cheyne in <datestruct value="1673--"><year reg="1673">1673</year></datestruct>, and was finally made over to them by Sir Hans Sloane in <datestruct value="1722--"><year reg="1722">1722</year></datestruct>.

   <p>Fronting the river is the pretty water-side terrace called 
<rs type=subject>Cheyne Walk</rs> (from the Cheynes, once lords of the manor). Though much altered since the river has been thrust back by the Embankment, this, more than any place outside Hampton Court, recalls, in the brick houses and rows of trees like those in the Dutch towns, the time of William and Mary. The lower part of the terrace has a row of somewhat stately houses, bow-windowed, balconied, and <pb id="p.430" n="430"> possessing old iron gates with pillars and pine-apples: in the upper part the line of ancient shops ends at the old church, while beyond the broad river are the yet open fields of Battersea. While the Thames was yet the aristocratic highway, Chelsea was the most convenient of country residences, and many of the great nobles had houses here. Elizabeth annually celebrated the anniversary of her coronation by coming in her barge to dine here with the Earl of Effingham, Lord High Admiral, the only person who had sufficient influence with her to make her go to bed in her last illness. There was a quadrangular royal manor-house here enclosing a courtyard (near where the pier now stands) which was long inhabited by illustrious relations of the sovereign. It was settled upon Queen Catherine Parr by Henry VIII. at her marriage, and to it she retired at his death. Hither her <num value="4">fourth</num> husband, Sir Thomas Seymour, came secretly to woo her (being still only in her <num value="35">35th</num> year) within <num value="2">two</num> months of the King's death, and she, fearing the displeasure of Edward VI., and still more that of the Protector Somerset and his proud wife, wrote hence to beg him to <QUOTE>come without suspect,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>I pray you let me have knowledge over-night at what hour ye will come, that your portress may wait at the gate to the fields for you.</QUOTE> <NOTE id="n.430.1">Letters of <title>Kateryn the Quene.</title></NOTE> At the time of the Queen's <num value="4">fourth</num> marriage, her stepdaughter, the Princess Elizabeth, then only <num value="13">thirteen</num>, was residing with her at Chelsea, and here occurred those probably innocent familiarities which were afterwards made <num value="1">one</num> of the articles in the impeachment of Seymour. After Catherine's death at Sudeley Castle in <datestruct value="1548--"><year reg="1548">1548</year></datestruct>, the old royal manor of Chelsea appears to have been given to the Duke <pb id="p.431" n="431"> of Northumberland, father-in-law of Lady Jane Grey (whence his widow's burial in the church), and then to another Queen, <QUOTE>Anna, the daughter of Cleves,</QUOTE> as she signed herself, who died at Chelsea, <datestruct VALUE="1557-07-10"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=10>10</day>, <year reg=1557>1557</year></datestruct>, and was taken thence to be buried in Westminster Abbey with the splendour denied in her lifetime. Elizabeth afterwards granted the manor to the widowed Anne, Duchess of Somerset, aunt of Edward VI., who made it her residence.

You would say there was in that place Plato's academy; but I do his house an injury in comparing it to Plato's academy, where there were only disputations of numbers and geometrical figures, and sometimes of moral virtues. I should rather call his house a school or university of Christian Religion; for though there is none therein but readeth or studieth the liberal sciences, their special care is piety and virtue: there is no quarrelling or intemperate words heard; none seem idle; that worthy gentleman doth not govern with proud and lofty words, but with well-timed and courteous benevolence; everybody performeth his duty, yet there is always alacrity; neither is sober mirth anything wanting.</QUOTE>

After the brief reign of Lady Jane was over, the Duchess saw her husband and her son Lord Guildford Dudley beheaded on Tower Hill, her son John die in the Tower, and the confiscation of all her property: but she survived these calamities, and, having borne all her trials quietly with great wisdom and prudence, she lived to see the restoration of her house.

    <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Thomas More, of the city of London, was of an honourable, though not a noble family, and possessed considerable literary attainments. After having, as a young man, practised for some years at the bar, and served as sheriff for his native city, he was summoned to the palace and made a member of the Privy Council by the invincible king Henry VIII. (who received the distinction unattained by any other sovereign, of being justly called Defender of the Faith, which he had supported both with his sword and pen). He was then made a knight and vice-treasurer, and through excessive royal favour was created chancellor, <num value="1">first</num> of the Duchy of Lancaster, and afterwards of England. In the mean time, he had been returned to serve in Parliament, and was besides frequently appointed ambassador by his Majesty. The last time he filled this high office was at Cambray, where he had for a colleague, as chief of legation, Tunstall, Bishop of London, soon afterwards of Durham, a man scarcely excelled by any of his contemporaries in learning, prudence, and moral worth; at this place he was present at the assembly of the most powerful monarchs of Christendom, and beheld with pleasure the renewal of ancient treaties, and the restoration of a long-wished--for peace to the world.  <Q>Grant, O ye Gods, that this peace may be eternal!</Q>  
   <p> In this round of duties and honours he acquired the esteem of the best of princes, the nobility and people, and was dreaded only by thieves and murderers (and heretics).<NOTE id="n.442.2">Fuller says that More had a tree in his garden at Chelsea which he called  <Q>the tree of truth,</Q> and that he.used to bind heretics to it to be scourged.</NOTE> At length his father, Sir John <pb id="p.443" n="443"> More, was nominated by the king a member of the Privy Council. He was of a mild, harmless, gentle, merciful, and just disposition, and was in excellent health, though an old man. When he had seen his son Chancellor of England, he felt that his life had been sufficiently prolonged, and passed gladly from earth to heaven. 
   <p>At his death, the son, who in his father's lifetime was esteemed a young man both by himself and others, deeply lamenting his father's loss, and seeing <num value="4">four</num> children and <num value="11">eleven</num> grandchildren around him, began to feel the pressure of years.   Shortly afterwards this feeling was increased by a pulmonary affection, which he regarded as the sure forerunner of old age. Therefore, wearied of worldly enjoyments, he obtained permission from the best of princes to resign his dignities, that he might spend the closing years of his life free from care, which he had always desired, and that, withdrawing his mind from the occupations of this world, he might devote himself to the contemplation of immortality. As a constant reminder of the inevitable approach of death, he has prepared this vault, whither he has removed the remains of his <num value="1">first</num> wife. Good Reader, I beseech thee, that thy pious prayers may attend me while living, and follow me when dead, that I may not have done this in vain, nor dread with trembling the approach of death, but willingly undergo it for Christ's sake, and that death to me may not be really death, but rather the door of a more blessed life.</QUOTE>

 <p>Knightsbridge, till lately a suburb, now part of London, skirts the southern side of Hyde Park. It is supposed to derive its name from <num value="2">two</num> knights who quarrelled on their way to receive the Bishop of London's blessing, and, fighting, killed each other by the bridge over the West Bourne.   The brook called the West Bourne has shared the fate of all London brooks, and is now a sewer, but it still works its way under ground from Hampstead, after giving its name to a district in Bayswater, and passes under Belgravia to the Thames. Pont Street has its name from a bridge over the West Bourne. 
   <p>At the crossways, where the Brompton Road turns off to the left, is <hi rend=italics>Tattersall's</hi>, the most celebrated auction mart for horses in existence, and the headquarters of horse-racing, established in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct> by Richard Tattersall, stud-groom to the last Duke of Kingston.   Sales take place every Monday throughout the year, and every Thursday during the season.   The business of the   firm is confined to the selling of horses; they have nothing to do with the betting. <pb id="p.452" n="452"> 
   <p>Following the Knightsbridge Road on the left are several of the handsomest houses in London-<rs type=subject>Kent House</rs> (Louisa, Lady Ashburton), on the site of a house once inhabited by the Duke of Kent; <rs type=subject>Stratheden House</rs>, where Lord Campbell wrote his <title>Lives of the Lord Chancellors; </title> and <rs type=subject>Afford House</rs> (Lady Marian Alford), an admirable building of brick, with high roofs, and terra-cotta ornaments.

The pedestal, whose classic forms so strangely contrast with the Gothic structure above, is decorated with a vast number of statuettes in high relief, representing different painters, sculptors, and musicians, from Hiram and Bezaleel, Cheops and Sennacherib, to Pugin, Barry, and Cockerell!

   <p><rs type=subject>Kensington Palace</rs>, as Nottingham   House, was the residence of the Lord Chancellor Heneage Finch, Earl of Nottingham.

Immediately after the king's return (<datestruct VALUE="1691-11-10"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=10>10</day>, <year reg=1691>1691</year></datestruct>) a great fire broke out in the palace, in which William and Mary, having narrowly escaped being burnt in their beds, fled into the garden, whence they watched their footguards as they passed buckets to extinguish the flames.

His son was Edward, Earl of Warwick, who died in <datestruct value="1701--"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>, and whose widow (Charlotte, daughter of Sir Thomas Middleton of Chirk) married Joseph Addison, <QUOTE>famous for many excellent works,</QUOTE> as he is described in the announcement of his marriage in 
<title>The Political State of Great Britain,</title> for <datestruct VALUE="1716-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>.

    <p>The Earl of Warwick, who was Addison's step-son, only <pb id="p.466" n="466"> survived him <num value="2">two</num> years, and was succeeded by his cousin William Edwardes (created Baron Kensington in <datestruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct>), who sold Holland House in <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct> to Henry Fox, <num value="1">first</num> Lord Holland. 
   <p>The fortunes of the Fox family were founded by Sir Stephen Fox, who gained the favour of Charles II. by being the <num value="1">first</num> to announce the death of Cromwell to him at Brussels. He was made Clerk of the Green Cloth and Paymaster of the Forces, and acquired a great fortune, <QUOTE>honestly got and unenvied, which is nigh to a miracle,</QUOTE> says Evelyn. Sir Stephen Fox, <QUOTE>of a sweet nature, well-spoken, well-bred, and so highly in his Majesty's esteem,</QUOTE> was the practical founder of Chelsea Hospital, as well as of many other charitable institutions.   By deserting the cause of James II. he continued to enjoy Court favour till his death in <datestruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>, when Anne was on the throne. His <num value="2">second</num> son, the son of his <num value="2">second</num> wife, was Henry Fox, the Secretary of State and Paymaster of the Forces. It was with him that Lady Caroline Lennox, the Duke of Richmond's daughter-after she had cut off her eyebrows to protect herself from an unwelcome marriage arranged by her father-eloped in <datestruct value="1744--"><year reg="1744">1744</year></datestruct>. Having endured the fury of her parents for <num value="4">four</num> years, she was forgiven on the birth of her eldest son. Henry Fox was created Lord Holland after his purchase of Holland House, where he died in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>. His son Stephen, who succeeded him, only survived him <num value="6">six</num> months, and left an only son, Henry, <num value="3">third</num> Lord Holland, who was educated under the guardianship of his uncle, Charles James Fox, the famous orator and statesman. 
   <p>Under the <num value="3">third</num> Lord Holland, Holland House attained <pb id="p.467" n="467"> a splendour and beauty which it had never acquired before, and it became an intellectual centre, not only for England, but for the world. Its master is remembered as the most genial of mankind; Lady Holland, though wayward and fanciful, was also beautiful and clever; Miss Fox, Lord Holland's sister, was loving, gracious, and charitable. Sydney Smith, Luttrell, and Allen were habitu&eacute;s of the house, and had their fixed apartments assigned to them.   The list of guests included Sheridan, Blanco White, Parr, Byron, George Ellis, Lord Jeffrey, Payne Knight, Thurlow, Eldon, Brougham, Lyndhurst, Sir Humphry Davy, Count Romford, Lord Aberdeen, Lord Moira, Windham, Curran, Sir Samuel Romilly, Washington Irving, Pozzo di Borgo, Counts Montholon and Bertrand, Princess Lieven, the Humboldts, Talleyrand, Tom   Moore, Madame de Stael, Macaulay.   Daily all that was most brilliant in European society was welcomed uninvited to the hospitable dinner-table.   It was no wonder that Sydney Smith heard <QUOTE><num value="500">five hundred</num> travelled men assert that there was no such agreeable house as Holland House.</QUOTE> 
   <p>The <num value="3">third</num> Lord Holland died in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, and was succeeded by his son, British Minister at Florence. He died in <datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>. Under his widow, Mary Augusta, Lady Holland, daughter of the <num value="8">eighth</num> Earl of Coventry, Holland House still has the reputation of being the most charming house in England. 
    <p>As we pass the terrace which bounds the garden and enter the deep belt of shade which encircles the mansion, the most conspicuous feature is a gateway with stone piers by  Inigo Jones bearing the arms of Rich, approached by a <pb id="p.468" n="468"> double flight of steps enclosing a fountain. The house is now entered from the east side; originally the entrance was on the south, and it was there that William Penn, to whom Holland House was let for a time, narrates that he could scarcely get down the steps through the crowd of suitors who besought him to use his good offices with the king in their behalf. 
    <p>The <hi rend=italics>Interior</hi> of Holland House is full of historical relics, <pb id="p.469" n="469"> pictures, and china.   Many of the portraits are by Watts, who <num value="1">first</num> rose into fame under the patronage of Elizabeth, Lady Holland, and who painted, for the walls of the house, many of the most valued friends of its master. <num value="1">One</num> of his best portraits is that of Princess Lieven. 
   <p>In the last of <QUOTE>the West Rooms</QUOTE> --around which, to those who know it well, many of the happiest associations of the house are entwined--are <num value="3">three</num> interesting works of <hi rend=italics>Hogarth</hi>, a view of Ranelagh; a portrait of the <num value="1">first</num> Lord Holland; and a scene of Private Theatricals (from Dryden's Indian Emperor) at the house of Mr. Conduitt, Master of the Mint, in which the <num value="1">first</num> Lady Holland, then Lady Caroline Lennox, with her father and mother, took a part.   Her portrait by <hi rend=italics>Ramsay</hi> also hangs here, with that of her sister Lady Cecilia Lennox, who died of consumption at Holland House. 
   <p>From the <num value="3">third</num> of the West Rooms a staircase leads to the <hi rend=italics>Library</hi> (originally a Portrait Gallery), a long room, warm with a glow of crimson velvet, with <num value="2">two</num> great carved chimney-pieces, and deeply recessed windows, from <num value="1">one</num> of which there is a view, through the dark boughs of a cedar, into the radiant flower-garden. In <num value="1">one</num> corner is Addison's folding-table (purchased at Rogers' sale) covered with faded green velvet, blotted by his pen. A little lobby leads from the library to the inner rooms. Here, on a pane of glass, are the lines written by Hookham Frere in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>--

<p>The gardens of Holland House are unlike anything else <pb id="p.472" n="472"> in England.   Every turn is a picture: Art has combined with Nature to make it so, and has never intruded upon Nature.

   <QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE>Yet a few years, and the shades and structures may follow their illustrious masters. The wonderful city which, ancient and gigantic as it is, still continues to grow as fast as a young town of logwood by a water-privilege in Michigan, may soon displace those turrets and gardens which are associated with so much that is interesting and noble, with the courtly magnificence of Rich, with the loves of Ormond, with the counsels of Cromwell, with the death of Addison. The time is coming when, perhaps, a few old men, the last survivors of our generation, will in vain seek, amidst new streets, and squares, and railway stations, for the site of that dwelling which was in their youth the favourite resort of wits and beauties, of painters and poets, of scholars, philosophers, and statesmen. They will then remember, with strange tenderness, many objects once familiar to them, the avenue and terrace, the busts and the paintings, the carving, the grotesque gilding, and the enigmatical mottoes. With peculiar fondness they will recall that venerable chamber, in which all the antique gravity of a college library was so singularly blended with all that female grace and wit could devise to embellish a drawing-room. They will recollect, not unmoved, those shelves loaded with the varied learning of many lands and many ages, and those portraits in which were preserved the features <pb id="p.475" n="475"> of the best and wisest Englishmen of <num value="2">two</num> generations. They will recollect how many men who have guided the politics of Europe, who have moved great assemblies by reason and eloquence, who have put life into bronze and canvas, or who have left to posterity things so written as it shall not willingly let them die, were there mixed with all that was loveliest and gayest in the society of the most splendid of capitals. These will remember the peculiar character which belonged to that circle, in which every talent and accomplishment, every art and science, had its place. They will remember how the last debate was discussed in <num value="1">one</num> corner, and the last comedy of Scribe in another; while Wilkie gazed with modest admiration on Sir Joshua's Baretti; while Mackintosh turned over Thomas Aquinas to verify a quotation; while Talleyrand related his conversations with Barras at the Luxembourg, or his ride with Lannes over the field of Austerlitz. They will remember, above all, the grace, and the kindness, far more admirable than grace, with which the princely hospitality of that ancient mansion was dispensed. They will remember the venerable and benignant countenance and the cordial voice of him who bade them welcome. They will remember that temper which years of pain, of sickness, of lameness, of confinement, seemed only to make sweeter and sweeter, and that frank politeness, which at once relieved all the embarrassment of the youngest and most timid writer or artist, who found himself for the <num value="1">first</num> time among Ambassadors and Earls. They will remember that constant flow of conversation, so natural, so animated, so various, so rich with observation and anecdote; that wit which never gave a wound; that exquisite mimicry, which ennobled instead of degrading; that goodness of heart which appeared in every look and accent, and gave additional value to every talent and acquirement. They will remember, too, that he whose name they hold in reverence was not less distinguished by the inflexible uprightness of his political conduct, than by his loving disposition and his winning manners. They will remember that, in the last lines which he traced, he expressed his joy that he had done nothing unworthy of the friend of Fox and Grey; and they will have reason to feel similar joy, if, in looking back on many troubled years, they cannot accuse themselves of having done anything unworthy of men who were distinguished by the friendship of Lord Holland.</QUOTE><BIBL>-Macaulay.</BIBL></CIT></QUOTE>

   <p>Hence we reach the <hi rend=italics>North Gallery</hi>, which contains the celebrated <hi rend=italics>Cartoons of Raffaelle</hi>, being the original designs (drawn with chalk upon strong paper and coloured in distemper) by Raffaelle and his scholars, especially Francesco Penni, for the tapestries ordered by Leo X. to cover the lower walls of the Sistine Chapel, the upper part being already clothed with the glorious frescoes which still adorn them. There were originally <num value="11">eleven</num> Cartoons, but <num value="4">four</num> are lost-The Stoning of Stephen, The Conversion of St. Paul, St. Paul in his Dungeon at Philippi, and the Coronation of the Virgin, which last was intended to fill the space above the altar. The tapestries were executed at Arras, and were hence called <hi rend=italics>Arazzi</hi>. They were worked under the superintendence of Bernard   van   Orley, a Dutch   pupil of Raffaelle, and were hung up in the Sistine, on St. Stephen's Day, <datestruct VALUE="1519-12-26"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=26>26</day>, <year reg=1519>1519</year></datestruct>. <num value="8">Eight</num> years after, they were carried off in the sack of Rome by the French, but were restored to Julius III. by the Constable Anne de Montmorency.   In <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct> they were again carried off by the French, and passing through various hands, were repurchased by Pius VII. in <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct> from a Frenchman named Devaux, at Genoa. Though greatly faded and much injured by bad restoration, they still hang in the Vatican. <pb id="p.483" n="483"> 
   <p>The <num value="7">seven</num> Cartoons, which alone exist now, lay neglected in the manufactory at Arras till they were seen there in <datestruct value="1630--"><year reg="1630">1630</year></datestruct> by Rubens, who advised Charles I. to purchase them for a tapestry manufactory which was established at Mortlake. On the death of Charles, Cromwell bought them for <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure>.   They remained almost forgotten at Whitehall till the time of William III., who removed them to Hampton Court, where a room was built for them by Wren, in which they hung till they were brought to South Kensington. Tapestry workers have twice cut them into strips and pricked the outlines with their needles, <num value="1">first</num> at Arras, and afterwards at Mortlake, where several copies were executed. A splendid set of tapestries worked from the Cartoons whilst they were at Arras (probably ordered by Henry VIII.) was in the collection of Charles I. at Whitehall, and was purchased, after his death, by the Duke of Alva : they are now in the Royal Museum at Berlin. 
   <p>The Cartoons require many visits to be properly understood.   He who visits them   often will agree with Steele:

A young man, observing the distress of the apostles, tries to stop the sacrifice, and already, in some of the faces at the edge of the picture, is evinced the change in the temper of the people of Lystra, who afterwards stoned Paul.

The galleries on the ground-floor are occupied by objects <pb id="p.496" n="496"> illustrative of the Natural Products. Minerals, and Zoology of India.   On the upper-floor are specimens of Indian Manufactures. In Room IX. are the principal curiosities, which were formerly shown at the East India House- Runjeet Singh's golden throne, and Tippoo Saib's Tiger, taken at Seringapatam, which was made by mechanism to growl, and the Englishman it is supposed to be devouring, to scream, for his amusement. The passage by which the lower galleries are reached is occupied by the curious sculptures brought in <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct> from the Amravati Tope on the river Kistna in the district of Guntoor in Madras. 
   <p>The dull <rs type=subject>Horticultural Gardens</rs> occupy the site of those of Loudon and Wise, whose collection of trees and shrubs was so much eulogised by Evelyn.   To the south-west of these, at the junction of Cromwell Road and Gloucester Road, stood Gloucester Lodge, built for the Duchess of Gloucester and inhabited by Princess Sophia, and afterwards by George Canning. It was pulled down in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>. 
   <p>Returning to the Brompton Road, we find the Fulham Road running southwards. On the right is <rs type=subject>Onslow Square</rs>, which retains a portion of the fine avenue which once extended from the grounds of Cowper House to the Fulham Road, where it terminated opposite Hollis Place. 
   <p>The <rs type=subject>Consumptive Hospital</rs>, at the south-east corner of Onslow Square, occupies part of the grounds of Sydenham Edwards, the editor of the Botanical Register, which grounds existed till <datestruct value="1844"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>. The perfectly countrified aspect of Brompton at this time is described by Lord Lytton in his novel of <title>Godolphin.</title>

   <p>On the right are <rs type=subject>The Boltons</rs>, where <num value="40">forty</num> years ago <num value="6">six</num> brace of partridges used to rise in a morning, now regularly laid out with villas, much frequented by artists. 
<p>[The road leads through Walham Green to <rs type=subject>Fulham</rs>, which, though <num value="4">four</num> miles from Hyde Park Corner, requires a cursory mention here as the home of the Bishops of London. 
   <p>Fulham, which, according to Camden, means <QUOTE>the place of fowles,</QUOTE> but, according to most authorities, <QUOTE>the place of dirt,</QUOTE> is a pretty antiquated village with a wooden bridge over the Thames. The Inn of the Golden Lion existed in the time of Henry VII., and was for some time the residence of Bishop Bonner. At another tavern, the King's Arms, the Fire of London was annually commemorated on September i, in honour of its having given refuge to a number of city fugitives. The perpendicular <rs type=subject>Church of All Saints</rs>, which stands near the river, contains a great number of interesting monuments.   We may especially notice that of John Viscount Mordaunt of Avalon, father of the great Earl of Peterborough, <hi rend=italics>ob</hi>. <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, by Bushnell, sculptor of the figures on Temple Bar, with a statue by Bird; the noble monument by Gibbons to Dorothy Hyliard, <datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>, wife of Sir W. Clarke, Secretary at War to Charles II., and afterwards of Samuel Barrow, physician to the same, author of the Latin verses prefixed to <title>Paradise Lost;</title> the simple altar tomb of Sir William Butts, <datestruct value="1545--"><year reg="1545">1545</year></datestruct>, the physician <pb id="p.498" n="498"> to Henry VIII., mentioned by Shakspeare; the quaint monument of Margaret, wife of Sir Peter Legh of Lyme, <datestruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></datestruct>, and her <num value="2">two</num> babies; the mural monuments of Thomas Carlos, <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, son of the Colonel Careless who hid Charles II. in the oak, and was allowed to change his name to Carlos as a reward; of Thomas Smith, Master of Requests to James I., <datestruct value="1609--"><year reg="1609">1609</year></datestruct>; of Bishop Gibson, <datestruct value="1748--"><year reg="1748">1748</year></datestruct>; Bishop Porteus, <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>; and Bishop Blomfield, <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>. An admirable Flemish brass commemorates Margaret Swanders, <datestruct value="1529--"><year reg="1529">1529</year></datestruct>.   In the churchyard are the monuments of Sir Francis Child, <datestruct value="1713--"><year reg="1713">1713</year></datestruct>, and of Theodore Hook, <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>.   On the eastern side of the church are the tombs of a number of the bishops (beginning at the church wall)-Lowth, <datestruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></datestruct>; Terrick, <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct>; Randolph, <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>; Gibson, <datestruct value="1748--"><year reg="1748">1748</year></datestruct>; Sherlock, <datestruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>; Compton, <datestruct value="1713--"><year reg="1713">1713</year></datestruct>; Hayter, <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>; Robinson, <datestruct value="1723--"><year reg="1723">1723</year></datestruct>. Near the tomb of his patron, Bishop Compton, lies Richard Fiddes, author of the Life of Cardinal Wolsey.   In the grave of Bishop Lowth rests his friend Wilson, Bishop of Bristol, <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>. 
   <p>A drive through an avenue, or (from the church) a raised causeway called <QUOTE>the Bishop's Walk,</QUOTE> leads to <rs type=subject>Fulham Palace</rs>, the ancient manor-house of the Bishops of London. A gateway is the approach to a quaint picturesque courtyard surrounded by low buildings of red and black bricks, erected by Bishop Fitzjames in the reign of Henry VII. The interior of the palace is unimportant, though the Library contains a number of episcopal portraits, including that of Bishop Ridley, whose <num value="4">four</num> years' residence here is <num value="1">one</num> of the most interesting periods in the history of the palace. Under his hospitable roof the mother and sister of his predecessor, Bonner, continued to reside, ever-welcome <pb id="p.499" n="499"> guests at his table, where the place of honour was always reserved for <QUOTE>our mother, Bonner.</QUOTE>   The palace gardens were filled with rare shrubs by Bishop Grindal, who was a great gardener: they still contain a very fine cork-tree. A picturesque garden-gateway bears the arms of Bishop Fitzjames. The <hi rend=italics>Chapel</hi>, in the garden, was built by Butterfield for Bishop Tait, <datestruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct>. 
    <p>In the water-meadows and on the river banks, near  Fulham Palace, may be recognised many of the familiar subjects in the pictures of De Wint, who repeated them over and over again. In ascending the river to Fulham a perfect gallery of De Wints is seen. 
    <p>Near the palace is <rs type=subject>Craven Cottage</rs>, much admired when it was built by Lady Craven, afterwards Margravine of  Anspach. At <rs type=subject>Parson's Green</rs>, a hamlet of Fulham, lived <pb id="p.500" n="500"> Lord Mordaunt, whose tomb is in the church, and his son, the famous Earl of Peterborough.
