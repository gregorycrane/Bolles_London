<head>Character of Mrs. Evelyn. 
<LB>By Dr. Bohun.<note>The Rev. Dr. Ralph Bohun, D.C.L., was a scholar at Winchester College, and was elected probationary fellow of New College, Oxford, at the early age of <num value="19">19</num>. In <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct> he wrote a Discourse on the History and Nature of Wind; and in <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>, he completed his Doctor's degree. His connection with Evelyn's family arose from his having superintended the education of his son.</note></head>

<p><text><body><p>I had lately occasion to review several letters to me from Mrs. Evelyn of Deptford. After reading them, I found they were much to be valued, because they contained not only a complete description of the private events in the family, but public transactions of the times, where are many curious and memorable things described in an easy and eloquent style. 
<p>Many forgotten circumstances by this means are recalled afresh to my memory; by so full and perfect a narration of them, they are again present to my thoughts, and I see them re-acted as it were before my eyes. This made strong impressions on my mind, so that I could not rest till I had recollected the substance of them, and from thence some general reflections thereon, and from thence drew a character of their author, so far only as by plain and natural inferences may be gathered from their contents. This was not performed in a manner worthy of the design, but hastily and incorrectly, which cost no more time than could be employed at <num value="1">one</num> sitting in an afternoon; but in <pb id="p.4" n="4"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>.</note>
this short model, Mrs. Evelyn will appear to be the best daughter and wife, the most tender mother, and desirable neighbour and friend, in all parts of her life. The historical account of matters of fact sufficiently set forth her praises, wherein there could be no error or self--conceit; and declare her to be an exact pattern of many excellent virtues; but they are concealed in such modest expressions, that the most envious censurers can't fix upon her the least suspicion of vanity or pride. Though she had many advantages of birth and beauty, and wit, yet you may perceive in her writings an humble indifference to all worldly enjoyments, great charity, and compassion to those that had disobliged her, and no memory of past occurrences, unless it were a grateful acknowledgment of some friendly office; a vein of good-nature and resignation, and self-denial, runs through them all. There's nothing so despised in many of these letters as the fruitless and empty vanities of the town; and they seem to pity the misfortunes of those who are condemned by their greater quality or stations to squander away their precious time in unprofitable diversions, or bestow it in courtly visits and conversations. Where there happens to be any mention of children or friends, there is such an air of sincerity and benevolence for the <num value="1">one</num>, and religious concern for the happiness of the other, as if she had no other design to live in the world than to perform her own duty, and promote the welfare of her relations and acquaintance. 
<p>There's another observation to be collected, not less remarkable than the rest, which is her indefatigable industry in employing herself, and more for the sake of others than her own: This she wrote, not out of vain glory, or to procure commendation, but to entertain them with whom she had a familiar correspondence by letters, with the relation of such accidents or business wherein she was engaged for the month or the week past. 
<p>This was a peculiar felicity in her way of writing, that though she often treated of vulgar and domestic subjects, she never suffered her style to languish or flag, but by some new remark or pleasant digression kept it up to its usual pitch. 
<p>The reproofs in any of these numerous letters were so <pb id="p.5" n="5"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>.</note>
softly insinuated, that the greatest punishment to be inflicted upon any disobligation was only to have the contrary virtue to the fault they had been guilty of, highly applauded in the next correspondence, which was ever so managed as to please and improve. 
<p>Scarce an harsh expression, much less any evil surmise or suspicion, could be admitted where every line was devoted to charity and goodness. This is no effect of partiality, but appears in the particular instances, so that the same judgment must be made by all unprejudiced persons who shall have a sight of them. 
<p>Any misfortune or disappointment was not mournfully lamented, but related in such a manner as became a mind that had laid in a sufficient provision of courage and patience beforehand to support it under afflictions. All unfortunate accidents are allayed by some consolatory argument taken from solid principles. No kind of trouble, but <num value="1">one</num>, seems to interrupt the constant intention to entertain and oblige; but that is dolorously represented in many of the letters; which is the loss of children or friends. That being an irreparable separation in this world, is deplored with the most affectionate tenderness which words can express. You may conclude that they who write in such a manner as this, must be supposed to have a just sense of religion, because there can scarce be assigned <num value="1">one</num> act of a beneficent and charitable temper but has many texts of the Gospel to enforce it. So that all good Christians must be very useful and excellent neighbours and friends; which made this lady ever esteemed so. She was the delight of all the conversations where she appeared, she was loved and admired, yet never envied by any, not so much as by the women, who seldom allow the perfections of their own sex, lest they eclipse their own; but as this very manifestly and upon all occasions was her temper, the world was very grateful to her upon that account. This happiness was gained and preserved by <num value="1">one</num> wise qualification; for though no person living had a closer insight into the humours or characters of persons, or could distinguish their merits more nicely, yet she never made any despising or censorious reflections: her great discernment and wit were never abused to sully the reputation of others, nor affected any applause that might <pb id="p.6" n="6"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>.</note>
be gained by satirical jests. Though she was extremely valued, and her friendship prized and sought for by them of the highest condition, yet she ever treated those of the lowest with great condescension and humanity. The memory of her virtues and benefits made such deep impression on her neighbours of Deptford and Greenwich, that if any <num value="1">one</num> should bring in another report from this, or what was generally received among them, they would condemn it as false, and the effect of a slanderous calumny: either they would never yield that any change should happen to this excellent lady, or they'd impute it to sickness, or time, or chance, or the unavoidable frailties of human nature. But I have somewhat digressed from my subject, which was to describe her person or perfections no otherwise than may be gathered from the letters I received;<note>Copies of many letters to Dr. Bohun were found at Wotton, but not those here referred to. Several of them will follow, with some addressed to other correspondents, as specimens of her manner and great good sense.</note> they contain historical passages and accounts of any more or less considerable action or accident that came to her knowledge, with diverting or serious reflections as the subject required, but generally in an equal and chaste style, supported by a constant gravity, never descending to affected sallies of ludicrous wit. 
<p>It's to be further observed, that though she recites and speaks French exactly, and understands Italian, yet she confines herself with such strictness to the purity of the English tongue, that she never introduces foreign or adopted words. That there's a great steadiness and equality in her thoughts, and that her sense and expressions have a mutual dependence on each other, may be inferred from hence&mdash; you shall never perceive <num value="1">one</num> perplexed sentence, or blot, or recalling a word in more than <num value="20">twenty</num> letters. 
<p>Many persons with whom she conversed or were related to her, or had any public part in the world, were honoured by very lively characters conferred on them, always just and full of discernment, rather inclining to the charitable side, yet no otherwise than as skilful masters who paint like, yet know how to give some graces and advantages to them whose pictures they draw. The expressions are clear and unaffected, the sentences frequent and grave, the remarks judicious, the periods flowing and long, after the Ciceronian <pb id="p.7" n="7"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>.</note>
way; yet, though they launch out so far, they are strict to the rules of grammar, and ever come safe home at last without any obscurity or incoherence attending them. 
<p>I will only give <num value="1">one</num> instance of a person who was characterized by her in a more favourable manner than he durst presume that he deserved; however, to show the method of her writing, I shall set it down. &ldquo;I believe (such an <num value="1">one</num>) to be a person of much wit, great knowledge, judicious and discerning, charitable, well natured, obliging in conversation, apt to forget and forgive injuries, eloquent in the pulpit, living according to known precepts, faithful to his friend, generous to his enemy, and in every respect accomplished; this in our vulgar way is a desirable character, but you'll excuse if I judge unrefinedly who have the care of cakes and stilling, and sweetmeats and such useful things.&rdquo; 
<p>Mrs. Evelyn has been often heard to say concerning the death of her admirable and beloved daughter, that though she had lost her for ever in this world, yet she would not but that she had been, because many pleasing ideas occur to her thoughts that she had conversed with her so long, and been made happy by her for so many years.

<p>SIR, 
<p>I am concerned you should be absent when you might confirm the suffrages of your fellow collegiots, and see the mistress both Universities court; a person who has not her equal possibly in the world, so extraordinary a woman she is in all things. I acknowledge, though I remember her some years since and have not been a stranger to her fame, I was surprised to find so much extravagancy and vanity in any person not confined within <num value="4">four</num> walls. Her habit particular, fantastical, not unbecoming a good shape, which she may truly boast of. Her face discovers the facility of the sex, in being yet persuaded it deserves the esteem years forbid, by the infinite care she takes to place her curls and patches. Her mien surpasses the imagination of poets, or the descriptions of a romance heroine's greatness; her gracious bows, seasonable nods, courteous stretching out of her hands, twinkling of her eyes, and various gestures of approbation, show what may be expected from her discourse, which is as airy, empty, whimsical, and rambling as her books, aiming at science, difficulties, high notions, terminating commonly in nonsense, oaths, and obscenity. Her way of address to people, more <pb id="p.9" n="9"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1667--"><year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>.</note>
than necessarily submissive; a certain general form to all, obliging, by repeating affected, generous, kind expressions; endeavouring to show humility by calling back things past, still to improve her present greatness and favour to her friends. I found Doctor Charlton with her, complimenting her wit and learning in a high manner; which she took to be so much her due that she swore if the schools did not banish Aristotle and read Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle, they did her wrong, and deserved to be utterly abolished. My part was not yet to speak, but admire; especially hearing her go on magnifying her own generous actions, stately buildings, noble fortune, her lord's prodigious losses in the war, his power, valour, wit, learning, and industry,&mdash;what did she not mention to his or her own advantage? Sometimes, to give her breath, came in a fresh admirer; then she took occasion to justify her faith, to give an account of her religion, as new and unintelligible as her philosophy, to cite her own pieces line and page in such a book, and to tell the adventures of some of her nymphs. At last I grew weary, and concluded that the creature called a chimera which I had heard speak of, was now to be seen, and that it was time to retire for fear of infection; yet I hope, as she is an original, she may never have a copy. Never did I see a woman so full of herself, so amazingly vain and ambitious. What contrary miracles does this age produce. This lady and Mrs. Philips!<note>The once &ldquo;matchless Orinda;&rdquo; now forgotten. An edition of her poems had come out during the present year.</note> The <num value="1">one</num> transported with the shadow of reason, the other possessed of the substance and insensible of her treasure; and yet men who are esteemed wise and learned, not only put them in equal balance, but suffer the greatness of the <num value="1">one</num> to weigh down the certain real worth of the other. This is all I can requite your rare verses with; which as much surpass the merit of the person you endeavour to represent, as I can assure you this description falls short of the lady I would make you acquainted with: but she is not of mortal race, and therefore cannot be defined.

<p>If it be true that we are generally inclined to covet what we admire, I can assure you my ambition aspires not to the fame of Balzac, and therefore must not thank you for entitling me to that great name. I do not admire his style, nor emulate the spirit of discontent which runs through all his letters. There is a lucky hit in reputation, which some obtain by the defect in their judges, rather than from the greatness of their merit: the contrary may be instanced in Doctor Donne, who, had he not been really a learned man, a libertine in wit and a courtier, might have been allowed to write well; but I confess in my opinion, with these qualifications he falls short in his letters of the praises some give him. 
<p>Voiture seems to excel both in quickness of fancy, easiness of expression, and in a facile way of insinuating that he was not ignorant of letters, an advantage the Court air gives persons who converse with the world as books. 
<p>I wonder at nothing more than at the ambition of printing letters: since, if the design be to produce wit and learning, there is too little scope for the <num value="1">one</num>; and the other may be reduced to a less compass than a sheet of gilt paper, unless truth were more communicative. Business, love, accidents, secret displeasure, family intrigues, generally make up the body of letters; and can signify very little to any besides the persons they are addressed to, and therefore must lose infinitely by being exposed to the unconcerned. Without this declaration, I hope I am sufficiently secure never to run the hazard of being censured that way; since I cannot suspect my friends of so much unkindness, nor myself of the vanity to wish fame on so doubtful a foundation as the caprice of mankind. Do not impute my silence to neglect. Had you seen me these <num value="10">ten</num> days continually entertaining persons of different humour, age, and sense, not only at meals, or afternoon, or the time of a civil visit, but from morning till night, you will be assured it was impossible for me to finish these few lines sooner; so often have I set pen to paper and been taken off again, that I almost despaired <pb id="p.11" n="11">

<p>SIR, 
<p>I think myself obliged, since this is the day designed for your happiness, to express the part I take in your joy, and join my wishes for the continuance of it. The favour you intend me on Monday I receive with much satisfaction, but fear you will not afford it us long, when you find the many inconveniences of a little house, a disordered family, and the difference in judgments; all which may be dispensed with, whilst health, the discretion of servants, and other accidents, permit; but should there be a miscarriage in any of these, the end of our joining families ceases, and I, who am sensible of my own defects and tender of my friends' contentment, cannot entertain the hopes you will be sufferers many days. Let not this surprise you, since it proceeds from a cautiousness in my nature, which will not suffer me to engage, where I have any part to act, with that assurance some are more happy in; therefore prepare your lady with the nicety of my temper, and the truth of this, that I may not pass in either opinions for a person that promises more than can be performed by,

I will suppose your college affairs take up much of yoru time, and that your diversions in Oxford are very charming; yet neither should make you so absolutely forget Deptford and those in it, as not to impart some of your pleasant thoughts, at spare moments especially, knowing how well we receive your letters, and how naturally our sex loves novelty, that I cannot but accuse you of unkindness; however, I am,

<p>SIR, 
<p>I have received your kind letter, and am not astonished Mr. Fuller finds so great a difference between a French pension and Woodcott table. Let him know eating is the least design of travellers; that particular waived, I still persevere in the defence of France; and will believe, when you have overcome the difficulties of the language, and gained some acquaintance amongst the better sort, visited the Court, seen the noble buildings and pleasant seats in and about Paris, you will render to what has been related to you, that it is an excellent country, wherein indeed riches are partially distributed, yet employed to great use and ornament. The people are little various in their tempers, for which blame the several nations from which they are descended; but all agreeing in the desire to enlarge their bounds, and augment the glory of the prince under whom the most of them do but breathe. I am sorry it was not my good fortune to stay till you came, or your lot to come when I was there, that I might have been assisting to your conversation. An ambassador is daily <pb id="p.13" n="13">

Montagu; since it does not depend on their abilities for the employment, but their being disposed to marry my Lord Arlington's wife's sister, as the necessary article to arrive to that dignity. When either is declared, you shall not fail of the address you desire. In the meantime any English gentleman must be well received by my Lord of St. Alban's. Though your eye be continually over my cousin your son, and your care as great as a tender and knowing parent's can be, yet I am persuaded you will find the breeding in an academy the likeliest way to answer all ends except that of expense, which must be greater there than elsewhere; but not to be valued, considering the advantages of good conversation, the emulation which young persons of good birth raise in <num value="1">one</num> another, the learning all manly exercises in community, and the gaining a good air and assurance best acquired by example, which works most with such ingenious and observing tempers as my cousin seems to be. The orders are generally good, the discipline strict, and, I am informed, the chief master in our time has left a nephew, that not only equals but excels him; and is also of the religion.<note>A Protestant, Mrs. Evelyn means.</note>
If you are inclined to take this course with my nephew this winter, you will find him out in the Faubourg St. Germain, so pleasant a part of the town I admire you can live out of it. When you walk to the Charity, if you inquire for the Rue Farrene you may see how pleasantly our house was situated. I fear you will judge I mention Paris with that affection persons in age remember the satisfaction of their youth, to which happiness was the nearest, at least in their opinion, and so past that there is no hopes of a return. Such, I confess, in part are my thoughts of that place, but must not flatter myself you will confirm me in them, who arrive there in a more discerning age, and carry with you a little prejudice against the people; yet something is to be expected from the justice of your nature in their behalf, and from the goodness of your nature in mine.

<p>SIR, 
<p>I have received yours with the enclosed to Mr. Bohun, which shall be conveyed to him with care. I am not to doubt of your good reception where your merit is well understood; I am rather to wish you may not meet with engagements to keep you long out of this country, which, if so unhappy as to impart vices to its neighbours, cannot boast of many virtues to spare. This may truly be esteemed an admiring age, if distance from what is worthy define it well; and what leads me to this opinion is the strange veneration paid to the ruins of ancient structures, greater than the entire edifices ever could pretend to; a sort of justice virtue challenges in our time, and leaves the practice to the choice of the succeeding age. To inform you of what passes here cannot be acceptable, since I suppose you are, not without the curiosity of travellers, desirous to collect foreign novelties; which, should you be exempt from, little is worth communicating to you from hence. The censure of our plays comes to me at the <num value="2">second</num> hand.

<p>SIR, 
<p>Had I not been assured by some of your friends that you were upon your return into England about Easter, I should not have omitted my acknowledgments for your obliging letter; but since finding, upon better information, that good fortune is not so near, give me leave to beg your excuse for an undesigned fault, and inquire farther what can be the charms of a place which has not only invited but detained persons of so much wit and merit in it? Can it be the natives' fame for learning of late years which is the powerful attraction? or the Irish beauties above those of other countries, which engages through such dangerous seas? It cannot be judged by Mr. Terryll that interest only should be the motive; there must be something more reasonable than rich fields and herds to souls so much raised above the vulgar. But I will give a stop to my curiosity, and satisfy myself that the same prudence which was our guide here accompanies you everywhere, and will maintain your choice of every thing but friends, which admits of no objection except the permission you give me to be of the number; yet I am certainly as much as any,

<p>DEAR SISTER, 
<p>The indisposition which you carried out of town, and the solitude you live in, gives me a desire to inquire after your health, and a title to interrupt your melancholy thoughts,<note>The death of her husband (Evelyn's brother Richard) had taken place a few months before.&mdash;See <hi rend=italics>Diary</hi>, vol. ii. pp. <num value="48">48</num>-<num value="9">9</num>.</note> though it be but with the assurance of our wishes for your perfect recovery. <num value="1">One</num> who is of so judicious a temper as you are, cannot, if you give your reason leave to act, but be armed against all accidents which may disturb your quiet in a great measure. I confess to be wholly insensible of sorrow or misfortune is as little to be wished, as it is seldom to be found; since the inequalities of human life contribute much to the happiness of it, so that the variety of ills prove not the greater share; which hitherto your condition seems to have exempted you from. It is true you have newly lost a friend and a guide, but you have it now more absolutely in your own power to be whatever prudence and generosity dictates to you. And as you have it in your power, so I am confident it is in your will to oblige and gratify a friend, especially <num value="1">one</num> who may challenge your kindness in some sort upon the account of <pb id="p.18" n="18"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>.</note>
avowed services and much worth, <num value="1">one</num> who has pursued your satisfaction preferably to his own interest, which shows he has a true sense of honour,&mdash;and not to keep you longer in suspense with the character of a person, better known to you by his actions than by any description I can make of him, it can be no other than my brother Glanvil; who certainly, being named, tells you wherein you may acknowledge past obligations and engage him for the future, by advancing his pretensions to my Lady Lewtner. Possibly you may think it early to propose anything of that nature to a discreet widow and your own sister, who it may be you could wish might never have any thoughts of changing her condition, upon like resolutions of your own; but be assured, persons so considerable for beauty, virtue, and fortune, will never enjoy that calm of those thoughts long; attempts will be made; persons of all degrees of merit and sufficient quality will make addresses, and value themselves by breaking through those rules of decency that they may be the <num value="1">first</num> discoverers of their extreme; therefore you ought not to blame my brother if he has already given marks of his, who from a long knowledge of my Lady's great merit and obliging nature, has taken courage to lay himself at her feet; from whence he must not hope to be raised if she were of a haughty mind, that could allow of no happiness but in great titles and vast riches (in which certainly it is not wholly to be placed); but did it consist in either, she is so secured by a large provision of both, that she need not require an addition from a husband; all that seems to be required is, her choice in a man that can value her perfections, be a friend to her interests, and make her happiness his own; which qualifications may assuredly be allowed my brother, who protests with all imaginable zeal and sincerity that he has no other design but her satisfaction and advantage, and to live with honour the rest of his days, towards which who would not that could assist, and who better can than yourself; an endeavour which acquits your obligations to a sister that you love, and a friend that you value; which that you will do cannot be thought strange, but that I should concern myself in my Lady Lewtner's affairs may appear so, being neither solicited by my brother, who knows nothing of my per- <pb id="p.19" n="19">

<p>DEAR SISTER, 
<p>I very much rejoice in the improvement of your health, and do still persist in my opinion that you may owe much of your happiness and quiet to your own prudence. I also continue to believe that my brother Glanvil deserves very much from you; and you have rightly guessed my meaning by the intrigue between my cousin Will and my niece, which would have proved no dishonour to him had he resolved to succeed in it, since we judge of things of that nature commonly by the event, and not from the means, but he being tender of your satisfaction made honour a very nice point. Give me leave to rectify a little mistake in Mr. Evelyn's behalf, who though he might often wish <num value="1">one</num> of the name worthy of my niece, never declared for my cousin Will more than that, if she should think him sufficiently deserving, with my brother and your consent, it was not a choice to be contemned and deplored, since he is likely to make a very good man; and farther than such a reply I believe he never made to several discourses on that subject, urged at several times by many of our relations and acquaintance. As to my Lady Lewtner's concern, I do acknowledge I ought not to have gone so far had I not flattered myself with the hopes of your embracing any proposition so much to my brother's advantage; but possibly you have reasons in reserve more powerful than those which are visible to the world against him; and it is not my single opinion, but the belief of many others, that my Lady, your sister, though never so prudent and cautious, may not injure herself in marrying such a person as he is; yet I will not importune you to be his advocate since you declare so positive a dislike to <num value="2">second</num> marriages in general, the only excuse you can make for not being his friend in this particular, be it on the account of gratitude or kindness, the <pb id="p.20" n="20">

Some part of this you will think strange doctrine, but I seriously beg of you not to persist in your opinions concerning marriage, and that you will conform to so good a father's desires as you have in this particular, and endeavour to establish your happiness beyond his life, which, that you may long enjoy, with all other blessings I heartily wish, being

<p>JACK, 
<p>I have received your letter and request for a supply of money; but none of those you mention which were bare effects of your duty. If you were so desirous to answer our expectations as you pretend to be, you would give those tutors and overseers you think so exact over you, less trouble than I fear they have with you. Much is to be wished in your behalf: that your temper were humble and tractable, your inclinations virtuous, and that from choice, not compulsion, you make an honest man. Whatever object of vice comes before you, should have the same effect in your mind of dislike and aversion that drunkenness had in the youth of Sparta when their slaves were presented to them in that brutish condition, not only from the deformity of such a sight, but from a motive beyond theirs&mdash;the hope of a future happiness, which those rigorous heathens in moral virtue had little prospect of, finding no reward for virtue but in virtue itself. You are not too young to know that lying, defrauding, swearing, disobedience to parents and persons in authority, are offences to God and man: that debauchery is injurious to growth, health, life, and indeed to the pleasures of life; therefore, <pb id="p.22" n="22">

now that you are turning from child to man, endeavour to follow the best precepts, and choose such ways as may render you worthy of praise and love. You are assured of your father's care and my tenderness; no mark of it shall be wanting at any time to confirm it to you, with this reserve only, that you strive to deserve kindness by a sincere honest proceeding, and not flatter yourself that you are good whilst you only appear to be so. Fallacies will only pass in schools. When you thoroughly weigh these considerations, I hope you will apply them to your own advantage, as well as to our infinite satisfaction. I pray daily God would inspire you with his grace, and bless you.

<p>SIR, 
<p>Though I will not murmur that you prefer West Dean to Deptford to pass your Christmas in, since the attractive upon all accounts is so much more powerful, yet give me leave to lament the loss of so good conversation as I promised myself in yours: but to let you see I can prefer the satisfaction of a friend to my own, I will turn my complaints of you into good wishes for the success of so reasonable an address, as I am persuaded you are now making; and could I question any perfection in the ladies you so much admire, it would only be how <num value="1">one</num> who deserves so well should so long dispute the merit of such a man as you are; do not imagine I pretend to compliment in return of those civilities you pass upon our sex, since, having the least title to your praises, I will have the least share in the acknowledgments; but to be just to you and serious in my opinion, I do repeat, what I have so often declared with sincerity in your concern, that might I, after such a loss as a good husband must be to a virtuous wife, hope to repair it by the choice of a <num value="2">second</num>, I should not only hope, but think myself secure, when I had <num value="20">twenty</num> years known and <pb id="p.23" n="23">

This my Lady Lewtner cannot be ignorant of; and being convinced that it is true, how is it possible she can resist her own happiness in making yours? what scruple can remain in the breast of a worthy woman, who finds all that is desirable in her power? she may oblige you with her person and show her generosity too, since you will not pretend to equal her in fortune, though in nothing else inferior were articles to be drawn: I would take the liberty to own as much to the lady herself, were the acquaintance I have with her such as is requisite to recommend advice; but I dare not offer my sense to be the guide of another's actions, though I flatter myself I do not err in this opinion: but what discourages me chiefly is the slight reception my sister Evelyn gave a few lines I writ to her on this subject, who I thought might have endeavoured more to your satisfaction than I find she is inclined to do, since not inconsistent with her own interest and the value she has for such a sister. Pardon the liberty I take to tell you my thoughts plainly, and the interruption I give those happy moments you now enjoy, to which I wish to bring increase.

<p>SIR, 
<p>If a friend be of infinite value living, how much cause have we to lament him dead! Such a friend was Sir Samuel Tuke, who retired out of this life on St. Paul's day [<datestruct VALUE="-01-25"><day reg="25">25</day> <month reg="01">Jan.</month></datestruct>] at midnight, and has changed the scene to him and us, and left occasion to all that knew him to bewail the loss. You need not to be made sensible by a character of a person you knew so well, and you can enumerate virtues enough to lament and shed some tears justly; therefore spare me the sorrow of repeating what effect it has wrought on such a mind as mine, who think no misfortune worth regretting besides the loss of those I love. Do not blame me if I believe it almost impossible to meet with a person so worthy in himself, and so disposed to esteem me again; and yet that is not the chiefest cause of my affliction. I might waive much of my own interest, had I not so many partners that will suffer equally. These are the trials which make Christian philosophy useful, not only by a resignation to the Divine decree, but by that hope which encourages us to expect a more lasting happiness than any this world can give, without which we were extremely wretched, since no felicity here has any duration. The greatest conquerors themselves are subject to this unsteady state of human nature, therefore well may I submit, whose concerns are trivial in respect of others.

<p>SIR, 
<p>I must believe you are very busy, hearing so seldom from you, and that you are much in the esteem of Dr. Bathurst,<note>Dr. Ralph Bathurst, Dean of Wells, and President of Trinity College, in Oxford, whose Life and Literary Remains were published by Thomas Warton.</note> since he judges so favourably of your friends. It cannot be the effect of his discernment which makes him give sentence in my behalf, being so great a master of reason as he is; but it is certainly a mark of his great kindness to you that he defers to your judgment in opposition to his own. I should not question yours in other things, but the wisest may be allowed some grains, and I conclude you no less a courtier than a philosopher. Since my last to you I have seen &ldquo;The Siege of Grenada,&rdquo; a play so full of ideas that the most refined romance I ever read is not to compare with it; love is made so pure, and valour so nice, that <num value="1">one</num> would imagine it designed for an Utopia rather than our stage. I do not quarrel with the poet, but admire <num value="1">one</num> born in the decline of morality should be able to feign such exact virtue; and as poetic fiction has been instructive in former ages, I wish this the same event in ours. As to the strict law of comedy I dare not pretend to judge: some think the division of the story not so well as if it could all have been comprehended in the day's actions: truth of history, exactness of time, possibilities of adventures, are niceties the ancient critics might require; but those who have outdone them in fine notions may be allowed the liberty to express them their own way, and the present world is so enlightened <pb id="p.26" n="26">

<p>SIR, 
<p>I wish you had remembered my answer to some discourses you held before your departure concerning my cousin Glanville: it might have spared you the trouble, and my cousins the importunity, of a proposition not at all to their advantage or our satisfaction, since Jack is designed for the law in good earnest, in which he can make little progress, should marriage intervene; neither will his grandfather, father, and myself sacrifice him for a fortune, but shall rest satisfied with such a mediocrity as may be obtained with stratagem when his age and discretion will allow of that tie. Besides, having heard my cousin had intentions to bestow his daughter and fortune upon <num value="1">one</num> of his name, it would not become us to select for ourselves to the prejudice of a relation we should willingly assist; therefore, upon the account of generosity or mistaken interest, let this design die as civilly as you can: when your time permits you to think of coming to town, you need not question your being welcome at Deptford; we are all well in health; all our relations are in town, your Deptford friends are well, and I am,

<p>SIR,

letter. Love cannot be the motive from a man prepossessed, nor can interest in either of us be the inducement; it must then be concluded a mutual disposition to like <num value="1">one</num> another's inclinations and tempers, which we will call friendship, and which, from this day forward, let neither piquant raillery nor pleasant interrupt, let neither censure nor whisper destroy; and if you sign these articles you shall never complain of a breach on my side. Well, what do you think of widows? are they not odd creatures? There is now a lady, newly a fine prize, near you. Who hovers about her yet? Can <num value="20">twenty</num> years esteem of the Sussex lady change into a violent passion for the Dorking lady? If need were, cannot you imagine more probability in an address there, than the other way; were she as considerable, I would advise it: but when <num value="1">one</num> goes to yoke oneself <num value="1">one</num> would be glad it should be very easy; consideration of religion and fortune will come into <num value="1">one</num>'s head whether <num value="1">one</num> will or no: and then, it may be, my friend Glanville is a happier man with liberty than so engaged; for marriage to such minds as yours and mine requires plenty and quiet, without which considerations, keep as you are, master of yourself; take heart, and, let fortune throw cross or pile, be merry, and always a friend to <num value="1">one</num> that will ever be yours, since I am,

<p>DEAR JACK, 
<p>I do not question your being very happy in so fine a place and so good company, neither do I think you wholly pass your time in diversion. I wish you early wisdom; it may prevent late repentance. Your father is gone a little journey with Mr. Treasurer, to Newmarket, and to my Lord Arlington's upon his earnest invitation;<note>It was on this occasion that Evelyn dined familiarly with the King, and was witness of &ldquo;fondness and toying&rdquo; highly characteristic of the time.&mdash;See <hi rend=italics>Diary</hi>, vol. ii. p. <num value="68">68</num>.</note> your grandfather is newly recovered of a fit of the gout; your sisters are all <pb id="p.28" n="28">

well except Moll, who, I fear, has taken a cold which may end in an ague. Mrs. Durfe comes down stairs after your sister Susan's fashion, she is yet so weak; we have been like to lose Mrs. Turner, but she is now passed danger; we shall certainly lose Madam Howard, and your spouse who is this night arrived, if the news hold that Sir Thomas Osborne brings his family this next summer to Deptford; Mr. Bohun sticks so close to his Spanish brother that we seldom see him; I have rare chocolate of his presenting for you. The foul weather and storms at sea have produced many shipwrecks and strange escapes. A seaman of this town, being the <num value="20">twentieth</num> in a rotten ship boat, which sunk by their weight, and the only <num value="1">one</num> amongst them that could swim, endeavoured to save the life of <num value="2">two</num> of his companions that laid hold of an oar by driving them to the shore; but finding his skill and strength fail him he shook off <num value="1">one</num> of the men, who gave him such a parting look so full of sorrow and pity, that though he came safe to land with his other companion, he cannot banish the thought of that dreadful farewell, nor almost forgive himself for not perishing with him. Another adventure of a Yarmouth fisherman, not less remarkable, who, being at sea when a great storm arose, alone in a little boat endeavoured to get to a bigger vesse which lay at anchor, but was loosened by the storm and set a drift, which he would have recovered, but in the attempt lost his oars, the waves dashing over him, so as he was almost overturned into the sea; when he saw a ship not far off, towards which he made, and by signs implored aid, which they speedily granted, and hauled him aboard. Few hours after, God gave him an occasion to show his gratitude; they being strangers, unacquainted with the coast, and in great danger of striking against the sands, which this old seaman perceiving, though he could not be understood by them in words, made them sensible by taking the rudder hastily from the steersman and turning another course, and so brought them safe to Yarmouth, where he saw his own abandoned barque returned safe also freighted with as many men as she could bring to harbour, which seemed to be a kind of providence for the safety of these men, who else had perished in a bigger vessel. To this accident it were desirable that some fine lady had made an escape to complete <pb id="p.29" n="29"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>.</note>
the adventure, which might have given you a subject for a copy of verses,&mdash;but what may not a poet add? Amongst the ships that made the late discovery of the new strait, <num value="1">one</num> had the ill fortune to perish with most of her men, and those few which escaped were preserved by the generosity of a seaman that could swim, who ventured <num value="5">five</num> times with success to the rescue of <num value="5">five</num> of his companions which he brought safe to shore, but perished endeavouring to bring in the <num value="6">sixth</num>; an attempt that merits a better fate, and not outdone in the Roman story, since more greatness of mind has not been often expressed. Were you here, there would be no end of these stories; but it is time I finished this discourse, to remember my obligations to my brother for his favours to you, and to wish my cousin joy of the little <num value="1">one</num>, since I hope the sorrowful hour is past. My service to my cousin Joe, to my cousin John, and to my cousin Mary when she returns.

<p>SIR, 
<p>When I have assured you that my usual indisposition has treated me so severely this winter, that I have had little leisure to think of anything but the means of gaining health and ease, I am persuaded you will excuse me if I have not decided in my thoughts which was the greatest captain, C&aelig;sar or Pompey; whether M. De Rosny were not a great politician, a brave soldier, and the best servant that ever Prince had for capacity, fidelity, and steadiness, a man strangely disinterested, infinitely fortunate, and every way qualified to serve such a master as was Henry the Great, who, notwithstanding human frailties, was worthy to be faithfully dealt with, since he knew how to judge and to reward. But why do we always look back into times past? we may not reproach our own, since here is at this present a scene for gallantry and merit, and whilst we may hope, we must not condemn. Should I tell you how full of sorrow I have been for the loss of Dr. Bretton,<note>Minister of Deptford; he died in <datestruct VALUE="1671-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>-<num value="2">2</num>.</note> you only would blame me; after death flattery ceases, therefore you may believe there was some cause to lament, when thousands of weeping eyes witnessed the affliction their souls were in; <num value="1">one</num> would have imagined every <num value="1">one</num> in this parish had lost a father, brother, or husband, so great was the bewailing; and in earnest it does appear there never was a better nor a more worthy man. Such was his temper, prudence, charity, and good conduct, that he gained the weak and preserved the wise. The suddenness of his death was a surprise only to his friends; as for himself it might be looked upon as a <pb id="p.31" n="31"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>.</note>
deliverance from pain, the effect of sickness; and I am almost persuaded God snatched him from us, lest he might have been prevailed with by the number of petitions to have left him still amongst us. If you suspect kindness in me makes me speak too much, Dr. Parr<note>Richard Parr, D.D., Vicar of Reigate and Camberwell. He died <datestruct VALUE="1691-11-2"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=2>2</day>, <year reg=1691>1691</year></datestruct>. The funeral sermon alluded to was printed in <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>. See Manning and Bray's History of Surrey, vol. i. p. <num value="323">323</num>.</note> is a person against whom you cannot object; it was he who preached the funeral sermon, and as an effect of truth as well as eloquence he himself could not forbear weeping in the pulpit. It was his own expression that there were <num value="3">three</num> for whom he had infinitely grieved, the martyred King, my Lord Primate,<note>Archbishop Usher.</note>
and Dr. Bretton; and as a confirmation of the right that was done him in that oration, there was not a dry eye nor a dissenting person. But of this no more.

<p>SIR, 
<p>Do not think my silence hitherto has proceeded from being taken up with the diversions of the town, the &eacute;clat of the Court gallantry, the entertainment of the wedding masquerades, which trebled their number the <num value="2">second</num> night of the wedding that so there was great disorder and confusion caused by it, and with which the solemnity ended: neither can I charge the housewifery of the country after my return, or treating my neighbours this Christmas, since I never find any business or recreation that makes me forget my friends. Should I confess the real cause, it is your expectation of extraordinary notions of things wholly out of my way. Women were not born to read authors and censure the learned, to compare lives and judge of virtues, to give rules of morality, and sacrifice to the Muses. We are willing to acknowledge all time borrowed from family duties is misspent; the care of children's education, observing a husband's commands, assisting the sick, relieving the poor, <pb id="p.32" n="32"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>.</note>
and being serviceable to our friends, are of sufficient weight to employ the most improved capacities amongst us; and if sometimes it happens by accident that <num value="1">one</num> of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> aspires a little higher, her fate commonly exposes her to wonder, but adds little of esteem. The distaff will defend our quarels as well as the sword, and the needle is as instructive as the pen. A heroine is a kind of prodigy; the influence of a blazing star is not more dangerous or more avoided. Though I have lived under the roof of the learned, and in the neighbourhood of science, it has had no other effect on such a temper as mine, but that of admiration, and that too but when it is reduced to practice. I confess I am infinitely delighted to meet in books with the achievements of the heroes, with the calmness of philosophers, and with the eloquence of orators; but what charms me irresistibly is to see perfect resignation in the minds of men, let whatever happen of adverse to them in their fortune: that is being knowing and truly wise; it confirms my belief of antiquity, and engages my persuasion of future perfection, without which it were in vain to live. Hope not for volumes or treatises; raillery may make me go beyond my bounds, but when serious, I esteem myself capable of very little, yet I am,

<p>MADAM, 
<p>I can assure you neither the cold weather nor the hilliness of the ways has kept me thus long from paying my respects to your Ladyship, but an indisposition to which I am subject, and which has treated me so severely this winter, that I have been confined to my chamber and house above <num value="3">three</num> months without once venturing out so far as the church; a kind of weaning me from that sensible loss we have made by the death of Doctor Bretton; a more worthy man there never was, and <num value="1">one</num> in whom there is so many things to be justly said in his praise, that should I but enter <pb id="p.33" n="33">

Madam Howard has almost quitted this place, with whose concerns I am as little acquainted as during her last long absence; yet I wish all imaginable happiness to that family. The marriage of Betty Turner with a citizen of London is the latest joy has been in this parish, the fame of which has not reached your Ladyship yet, at which fine clothes, fine company, and great feasting could not be wanting. My father has been so happy as to be free from the gout this winter. Mr. Evelyn is at present taking care of those that fall by the hands of the Dutch, being gone to visit Chatham and Dover, and the rest of those places where sick and prisoners put in; Jack is with him. My little flock of girls are all well, and I promise myself so much health as may give me leave to wait upon my Lady Vere and your Ladyship very suddenly. I keep the portrait of the Duchess of Richmond with care, that I may return if you should desire it; I am so out of the way of such kind of wits that I dare not pretend to judge of it, yet I fancy the Duchess deserves all that is said of her; and did the author pass for lover, much more might have been expected from him, but he has now another kind of gallantry in chase, which I wish may prove successful to him and those other brave men that daily hazard themselves in the war. I am so near the guns that your Ladyship will not wonder that I should be solicitous for a happy event, and I am not less concerned to be esteemed,

If knowledge and discernment in curious and choice speculations, joined with virtues not common, though desirable in your sex, may obtain return of friendship from persons who cannot be unjust, and therefore must allow you a share of their esteem, you may pretend; but should I hope for a part, it must be upon no other account, but as I have a little interest in you, and possibly a kindly thought of by you, which happiness produces many advantages to

<p>SIR, 
<p>I find the slight cares of a family are great hindrances to the study of philosophy, and that <num value="1">one</num> grows less and less capable of improvements by books, as <num value="1">one</num> grows more acquainted with the world; yet amongst those fine experiments which fall in my way, could I meet with any <num value="1">one</num> equally curious with those of the Greshamites, though as unuseful and trifling, I might hope in time to be in something famous; learning is become so easy of access by the late industry of some who have removed the bar language put to the illiterate, and make women pretenders to judge of Alexander's valour and conduct, and determine whether <pb id="p.35" n="35"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>-<num value="3">3</num>.</note>
the effeminacy and imbecility of the Persians did not abate of the miracles of such a conquest; that it was suddenly and unjustly gained, and as precipitously lost; and yet allow the man heathen worth who made all that stir till prosperity made him forget himself. He might have expected a better fate; but this subject has been in so many boys' mouths and themes, that it is reasonable for me to give it over and fall upon Dr. Pierce's sermons, which is a great step from Homer's admirer. Not to dispute the eloquence of the person who appears more like a Grecian orator than a Christian preacher for <num value="3">three</num> parts of each sermon,&mdash;which how necessary, now whole countries are under the Christian profession, I know not,&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> would imagine <num value="26">26</num> <num value="100">hundred</num> years had worn out the remembrance of idolising insensible orators; that there were no more need of drawing instances from the moral men to encourage virtue, where light and joyful truth have had such influences. But for the selections of young students whose <num value="1">first</num> compositions are far--fetched, and keep alive the stories of the ancients by succession in the pulpit, <num value="1">one</num> should hardly know who Socrates and Zeno were; and of what importance to the congregation, few in it understand. The great example should be Christ. His doctrine, and the effects of it in the <num value="1">first</num> ages of the church, when innocency and purity filled the minds of men; when the sincerity of their words appeared by the manifestation of good works; when the leaders and people lived in mutual charity and love. If this could be brought into fashion again it were a happy effect of men's labours. And since I have seen that piece of the primitive christianity, I fancy we are strangely out of the way to heaven; self-denial is a kind of by-path, and many necessary circumstances of a true believer are wholly out of use. Do not wonder I treat with you in this style, since I am assured you own it as the greatest honour that could have happened to you to serve at God's altar, and therefore cannot be displeased when anything is suggested to His glory. Your last to Mr. Evelyn gave us hope of seeing you suddenly.</text>

<p>MRS. SAUL, 
<p>The esteem I have had for you as a neigbour and a deserving person, makes me more concerned for the general censure upon your late quitting your husband and family: had you consulted real friends with your design, they never would have advised a separation without equal consent of both parties; there is something so strict and binding in the marriage vow, that but upon extraordinary causes (the examples of which are rare) any divorce can be lawful: women especially being very tender how they violate that obligation, choosing rather to bear with infirmities, to pray for and endeavour the reformation of an ill man, by all the ways respect and love can suggest, and to bear injuries patiently, valuing their mutual reputation above particular satisfaction, as the necessary duty of a good wife, and the common effects of a good Christian, which qualification enables persons to overcome their own inclinations for a better end yet than present or worldly advantages, and secures their future and more lasting happiness. There is no state of life unattended with cares and troubles, afflictions are common and fall to every <num value="1">one</num>'s share more or less, therefore we should not without great presumption expect to run the course of this life so smoothly as to meet with no rub by the way. I take the more freedom to enlarge upon this subject with you, because I am really sorry <num value="1">one</num> who appeared so sensible of what became her upon all accounts, as I have often observed you were, should take such ill measures in this last action as you have done; you cannot be ignorant how many there are who rejoice at peoples' misfortunes, and think they excuse their own errors by publishing others' failings; and I wish, and wish it heartily, you had not justified your husband by hurting yourself. I do remember some occasional discourse of yours to me in confidence, concerning some of his miscarriages, which obliged me to lament for you both, that a couple so likely by the agreeableness of person, quality, fortune, and age, should meet with any interruption to their happiness; but do now infinitely bewail it is come to so <pb id="p.37" n="37"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>-<num value="3">3</num>.</note>
wide a breach. I was in hopes you had convinced Mr. S. that it was both reasonable as well as convenient to reform the ill habits company might have engaged him in, and that he had wholly designed to take off your suspicion of a relapse; which disposition to virtue and kindness should have been complied with, and cherished by welcome at home, and all endeavours used to confirm him in so good a resolution. I know not what the real cause of dislike is on your part at present, neither will I judge. But were I to recommend Mr. S. to a wife in the temper I find him, I should pronounce in his behalf that he is likely to make a wife as happy as any man I know, if good humour, generous inclinations, industry, and many other good qualities, you have yourself done him the right to acknowledge him possessed of, can contribute towards it. Pray be so kind to yourself and him to return to all the duties of a wife; to forgive past faults like a Christian, to forget them like a friend; to begin your friendship upon a new account; and as caution for him, give me leave to be the person; your word is sufficient for yourself. Since he desires so earnestly to make you happy, banish all obstacles; do not entertain a thought that may check a blessing offered to you both.

Who would not try it, and submit to harder conditions than any I hope you will find?

with a note to Will. Hayes, which I have given him. He will punctually observe your orders concerning your horse; for the beer, according to his judgment of things, he believes, since it is left undisturbed to which cellar it should go, it most properly belongs to his, as being worst furnished of any in Deptford; yet upon <num value="2">second</num> orders it shall be bestowed where you please. You need not fear a long comment upon the lady's censure of my indulgence to children, since I confess myself too much inclined to that failing; but I have a maxim never to disturb the company with my own affairs, in showing dislike to servants' mistakes and children's faults; so that sometimes, I believe, I pass for a very fond mother and remiss mistress; yet it may be, in a convenient place, both are reproved; and amongst those who understand civility very well, this method is not unacceptable. Were I willing to entertain grief, I could answer to every particular of your <num value="1">first</num> letter; but since there is no recalling of the dead, let us not mingle past sorrows with the present; every moment produces new occasions to exercise our morality. To comply with Mrs. Palmer's request it is impossible, till I am as much convinced of the excellency of my style as Mr. Alderson is of his preaching, who assured me his last funeral sermon was an elaborate, judicious, welltimed piece; and then all the scraps I have written shall be at her service. And in the meantime advise her, since she is a person of wit, bred under Doctor Bathurst's wing, and lives in the air of the university, to hazard some of her own lines abroad, and try what justice may be in the world. If I do not enlarge at this time, impute it to Easter-Eve; and excuse this character, scarce legible.

Pray assure him and his lady I am their humble servant. When you are disposed to make us happy with your conversation, you cannot fail of welcome in a family that rejoice in the hopes of seeing you. You have conversed so much in the world, that you cannot be ignorant either of your own merit, or how kindly you will be received by those that have a real value for you. Be assured neither care nor industry would be wanting if an occasion would offer. Whatever else is unequal to you must be forgiven. The unsteadiness of the times is such, that a great man's favour is no sooner gained, but <num value="1">one</num> is to begin again; and the difficulty is to know where a new endeavour may be made. The next lesson will try how fast some of them sit. If you were <num value="1">one</num> of the house, you have a talent that might improve what interest you please. I suppose your correspondent is so good, I need not entertain you with news. The satisfaction I had in a week's stay in town was not so great that I should trouble you with the relation of it, besides the honour to have the Duchess's hand, visit the Duchess of Modena, &amp;c. Only this particular I cannot omit concerning Sir George Lane, who is married to a daughter of my Lord of Dorset, a young, handsome person, who has <num value="5000">5000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>

The son desires to go into Ireland; to oblige him perfectly, the father settles <num value="3000">3000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> a year on his son, and reserves as much for a <num value="2">second</num> venture: makes her a <num value="1000">thousand</num> a year jointure, and all the advantages in Ireland. I have had the honour to wait on the lady, and to give them both joy. My father has had his turn in town&mdash;proceeds as vigorously as he can in his affair, but they stand it out, which forces him to issue out an arrest against them. What that course may produce is yet to learn. He seemed desirous to finish it himself, as being best able to dispute their right, or defend his own; but the gout seizes him so often, though with less violence, that he is the more solicitous to end it. He is at present in bed, but not very ill. We have our workmen still, but hope a little time will finish all. Your brother watches and prays still. Jack studies and <pb id="p.40" n="40"> ruminates; the girls make a noise; and I lend a little of my time to any <num value="1">one</num> that seems to want it. How well I pass the hours in which I am not serviceable to others, I am no good judge. The conclusion of this year with this day, puts me in mind to wish you happiness with all imaginable joy the next.

<p>How to express the sorrow for parting with so dear a child is a difficult task. She was welcome to me from the <num value="1">first</num> moment God gave her, acceptable through the whole course of her life by a <num value="1000">thousand</num> endearments, by the gifts of nature, by acquired parts, by the tender love she ever showed her father and me: a thread of piety accompanied all her actions, and now proves our greatest consolation. The patience, resignation, humility of her carriage in so severe and fatal a disease, discovered more than an ordinary assistance of the Divine goodness, never expressing fear of death, or a desire to live, but for her friends' sake. The <num value="7">seventh</num> day of her illness she discoursed to me in particular as calmly as in health, desired to confess, and receive the blessed Sacrament, which she performed with great devotion; after which, though in her perfect senses to the last, she never signified the least concern for the world, prayed often, and resigned her soul. What shall I say! She was too great a blessing for me, who never deserved anything, much less such a jewel. I am too well assured of your Ladyship's kindness to doubt the part you take in this loss; you have ever showed yourself a friend in so many instances, that I presume upon your compassion; nothing but this just occasion could have hindered me from welcoming you to town, and rejoicing with the best friend I have in the world&mdash;a friend by merit and inclination, <num value="1">one</num> I must esteem as the wife of so worthy a relation and so sincere a friend as Sir Samuel was to me and mine.

<p>She had much improved herself by the remarks she had made of the world and all its vanities&mdash;what shall I add! I could ever speak of her, and might I be just to her without suspicion of partiality, could tell you many things. The papers which are found in her cabinet discover she profited by her reading &mdash; such reflections, collections out of Scripture, confessions, meditations, and pious notions, evidence her time was not spent in the trifling way of most young women. I acknowledge, as a Christian, I ought not to murmur, and I should be infinitely sorry to incur God's further displeasure. There are those yet remaining that challenge my care, and for their sakes I endeavour to submit all I can. I thank my poor Cousin a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times for her kind concern, and wish she may live to be the comfort you deserve in her, that God will continue the blessing of both, and make you happy&mdash;which is the prayer of her who is

<p>HONOURED SIR, 
<p>I am heartily sorry that I forced you to buy tulips for your fine garden. I must confess your guineas look more glorious than now these tulips do; but, when they come to blow, I hope you will be better pleased than now you are.

<p>I cannot, sir, send my husband's service to you, because I do not acquaint him with my trading for tulips. Sir John Shaw I cannot yet speak with (being taken up so much with visitors), as to know his mind about a gardener. Sir, I now beg your pardon for my rude lines, and desire you to assure yourself, that my husband and I, upon any occasion, shall be alway ready either to ride or go to serve you or yours. Thus having no more, but desiring to have my service to yourself, your lady, and Sir Richard Browne, and your beloved progeny, I shall take leave, and subscribe myself,

<p>MON AMY (that is, My Friend), 
<p>I am not so well pleased with Mrs. Owen's letter as with her tulips, because I am assured there must needs be some mistake, and that my gardener (who, perhaps, does not care that I should purchase anything but through his hands and in the common manner), as was to tell you that I would come myself and make friends with you, did leave that out. Can you ever imagine that I looked on your kindness as an imposing on me? Sure, you know me better than to think so; and that when I told you flowers of less value would better become my poor garden, it was neither to save my money nor reproach your merchandize. But I assure you I not only thank you for [them], but shall condemn you for a very unwise woman if you should forbear to continue a traffic which is so innocent, so laudable, and so frequent even among very great persons. You and I, therefore, must come to a better understanding upon this chapter. In the meantime I had a good mind to have sent you your last present back again, till all this had been cleared; for I do not love to be overcome in point of generosity, though I <pb id="p.43" n="43">

see that for this present I must be. You seen to think I complained I had not full measure, and think now to make it up by overwhelming me with your kindness. This is a revenge that I cannot long endure, as you shall be sure to find, the <num value="1">first</num> opportunity I can lay hold on. In the meantime I thank you most heartily for all your good intentions, and the kind offices which both you and the Doctor have ever been ready to do me. Sir Jo.

<LB>King Charles I. 
<LB>and his 
<LB>Secretary of State, Sir Edward 
<LB>Nicholas;

<div2 type=section id="c.2.35"><head>The Correspondence of Charles I. and Sir Edward Nicholas.</head>

<p>Few more valuable or more interesting illustrations of English history have been at any time made public than the Private Correspondence between Charles I. and his secretary-of-state, Sir Edward Nicholas. These letters were found at Wotton, with the correspondence of Evelyn; his father-in-law, Sir Richard Browne, whose papers he inherited, having been connected by marriage with Mr. Secretary Nicholas; and since their publication they have been quoted and commented upon by every historian or critic of the period on which they throw so much curious and important light. 
<p>In no respect illustrating or forming part of Evelyn's history, the reason which existed for modernising the spelling in the case of the &ldquo;Diary and Letters&rdquo; did not here apply. These papers are strictly historical documents, and, as such, are presented in all respects precisely as they were found; with the king's apostils, by way of answer or remark to his secretary's information, printed as written in the margin of the secretary's dispatches; with the queen's notes and messages appended; with the occasional ciphers as in the originals; and, throughout, whether in these particular letters or in the few additional ones of later date, with a strict adherence to the exact orthography of the individual writers. 
<p>The date of the commencement of the letters is <num value="1">one</num> of the most critical in the life of the king. It was that of the journey to Scotland, which preceded the fatal attempt to arrest the <num value="5">five</num> members. The king's motives for this journey have been variously surmised and stated; but that, besides his hope of effecting a better understanding with the Scotch parliament by personal communication with its members, they also included an attempt by means of the new anticovenanting Scotch party which had been secretly formed by Montrose, to obtain evidence available against the popular leaders in England, may be gathered from a study of the present correspondence. The feeling entertained in the House of Commons as to what was involved in the king's departure became manifest as soon as it was ascertained to have actually taken place; commissioners being immediately named and appointed to proceed to Scotland, ostensibly to treat with the Scots concerning the satisfaction of the treaty under discussion, but really to thwart as far as possible the king's suspected intentions. The new secretary-of-state, Nicholas, appointed <pb id="p.48" n="48"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>.</note>
on the flight of Windebank, had it left to him in charge by his royal master to furnish diligent information, during his absence, of what was going on in London; and his letters, noted and answered in the margin by Charles, and posted back to the writer, form the bulk of the succeeding correspondence. They begin with the king's <num value="1">first</num> letter from Edinburgh, written <num value="5">five</num> days after he quitted London, and continue during the whole of the stay in Scotland. After Charles's return there is a considerable interval in the correspondence, but it is resumed at the period of the treaty of Uxbridge, for which Nicholas was appointed <num value="1">one</num> of the commissioners; and is continued through the vicissitudes and disasters of the war, up to the king's detention by the army of the Scots, and his imprisonment at Holdenby and in the Isle of Wight. 
<p>Of Sir Edward Nicholas, who plays so prominent a part in this correspondence, and of whom Clarendon remarks that he was appointed secretary upon the king's observation of his virtue and fidelity, and without any other recommendation, some brief account may be expected by the reader. He was the eldest son of John Nicholas, Esq., of Winterbourne Earls, in the county of Wilts; was born in <datestruct VALUE="1592-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1592">1592</year></datestruct>-<num value="3">3</num>, educated at Oxford, and entered of the Middle Temple; resided some time in France, and on his return to England, directed his thoughts to public business. His <num value="1">first</num> official appointment was in the time of James I. He was named <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="6">six</num> clerks in chancery; and afterwards became secretary to Lord Zouch, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, who surrendered that employment to please the king, by enabling him to confer it on the Duke of Buckingham. The duke continued Nicholas in his office, and advanced him to be secretary to the Admiralty. The commissioners appointed to administer the affairs of the Admiralty, on the duke's death, also continued Nicholas as their secretary; and he retained the office till <datestruct value="1636"><year reg="1636">1636</year></datestruct>, when Algernon, Earl of Northumberland, being appointed Lord High Admiral, he was removed to the clerkship of the council. This brought him more within the personal view and knowledge of the king, from which resulted his selection for the office of secretary-of-state, when the flight of Windebank left it vacant in <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>. He received his knighthood at Whitehall, at the close of <datestruct VALUE="1641-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, the day after the king's return from Scotland. For his activity and earnestness in the execution of his duties, he had meanwhile become obnoxious to the Parliament, and was <num value="1">one</num> of those excepted in the terms which they offered to the king after he had raised his standard at Nottingham. Notwithstanding this exception, however, they did not refuse to receive him as <num value="1">one</num> of the king's commissioners at the treaty of Uxbridge. He was at Oxford during the time it was besieged by the parliament forces. On the death of the king he went to France, and afterwards joined the exiled prince at Rouen, on his arrival there from Jersey. <pb id="p.49" n="49"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>.</note>

<p>In this service he remained, discharging it at various places in France and Holland, till the treaty of Breda, when Charles went to Scotland. On his return, Nicholas again joined him at Aix; and when the Restoration came, in <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, he was continued as secretary. In <datestruct VALUE="1662-10--"><month reg="10">October</month> <year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, being then about <num value="70">seventy</num> years of age, he finally resigned the secretaryship, in which he was succeeded by Bennet, afterwards Earl of Arlington. He refused a peerage offered him by the king; and retiring to his seat at West Horsley, in Surrey, an estate which he had purchased of Carew Raleigh, Esq. (son of Sir Walter), died there in <datestruct VALUE="1669-09--"><month reg="09">September</month> <year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>. In the church of that parish are monuments erected to him and his descendants, who continued there till <datestruct value="1749"><year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>. He left <num value="4">four</num> sons. In <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, it would appear from the letters now printed, he had a house at Thorpe, in Surrey. 
<p>The reader of these letters will scarcely need to be told that he was not only a devoted servant of Charles I., but a diligent and faithful adviser, never scrupling to offer his opinion, and that a conscientious and honest <num value="1">one</num>. It is to the king's credit that he allowed him to do so, commending his openness, though unhappily for himself he did not always attend to the advice so given. It was Charles's greatest misfortune to have had few counsellors so judicious, industrious, and experienced as Nicholas; of such unimpeachable integrity, or of a temper so unambitious and averse to intrigue.

The Commons had been very busy since the King's departure: having brought fresh charges against the impeached Bishops; voted Perry, Jermyn, and Suckling, guilty of high treason; and established a complaint against the Queen's Capuchin Friars. Though the King was gone, yet Commissioners were left to exercise the royal functions in Parliament, and the assent was given to the Bill for Tonnage and Poundage on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>.

<p>May it please yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> most excellent Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>, 
<p>This morning about <num value="6">6</num> o'clock I receaved by y<hi rend=sup>e</hi>
hands of Mr. Murray yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> of the <num value="22">22</num>th, &amp; have acquainted my Lo.

<p>Before my receipt of yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> last letter I had acquainted my Lo. Keeper (in y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> absence of 
<note place=marg>I see your discretion may bee trusted in kreater maters.</note>
my Lo. Ch. Justice Bankes) w<hi rend=sup>h</hi> what yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>
commanded me, touching yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> engagem<hi rend=sup>t</hi> for transportac'on of <num value="4">4</num> regiments of Irishe for y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> service of the Spanishe King, &amp; w<hi rend=sup>h</hi> y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> reasons of it, &amp; his Lo<hi rend=sup>pp</hi> having that morning made y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> same knowne to the Lo<hi rend=sup>des</hi>, they thereupon had y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> next day a conference w<hi rend=sup>h</hi> y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Comons House, the result of w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi>
conference is not as yet reported to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Lo<hi rend=sup>des</hi> House, but I am tould, that the Comons<note>On the <datestruct VALUE="-08-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, when the House of Commons again took this affair into consideration, Sir Benjamin Rudyard spoke loudly against it; founding his objections principally upon the points here stated by Sir Edward Nicholas. The Commons then refused assent to the measure, in which the Lords agreed with them; and a letter, expressing their refusal, was sent to the King.</note> are very much against these <num value="4">4</num> regiments going for Spayne, in regard it crosseth w<hi rend=sup>th</hi> yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> &amp; y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Houses Declaration <pb id="p.55" n="55"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>.</note>
against y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Spanyard on behalf of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Prince Elector;<note>Charles Louis, elector of Bavaria, Prince Palatine of the Rhine, and nephew to Charles I., being the son of his sister Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia.</note>
&amp; therefore my Lo. Keeper thinkes not fitt to hasten y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> report of that conference: As soone as there shal be any order or resolucon in it by y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Parliam<hi rend=sup>t</hi>, I shall advertise it to yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>. I sent yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> letter to Sir Ph. Maynewaring<note>He was of Over Peover, in Cheshire, and father to the <num value="1">first</num> Baronet of that name, so created after the Restoration. He was Sheriff of Cheshire in <datestruct value="1639--"><year reg="1639">1639</year></datestruct>, and Captain in the Cheshire light horse. Collins does not mention his knighthood.</note> by an expresse messenger into Northamptonsh: whither S<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Phillip was gonne <num value="2">2</num> dayes before my receipt of yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> to him. 
<p>Since Satterday last there hath beene noe business done in Parliam<hi rend=sup>t</hi> of any publique nature<note>Again the Secretary is remiss, or at fault. Public business was certainly going forward. On the <datestruct VALUE="-08-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct> the Lords sequestrated the temporalities of Dr. Roger Manwaring, Bishop of St. David's, for his contumacy to an order of the House; and, on the day on which Sir Edward wrote his letter, both Houses had a conference respecting a proposed recess of Parliament.</note> that I can heare of; but only the order made by the Lo<hi rend=sup>des</hi>
touching y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> election of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> present Sheriffs of London, whereof I gave advertisem<hi rend=sup>t</hi> to Mr. Thre'r<note>&ldquo;Mr. Treasurer,&rdquo; that is, Sir Henry Vane the elder.</note> by myne of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> <num value="23">23</num><hi rend=sup>th</hi>.<note>This evidently relates to the dispute then existing between the Lord Mayor and the Commons of London; the former laying claim to the choice of <num value="1">one</num> of the Sheriffs, by a prescription of <num value="300">three hundred</num> years. The Livery refusing to abide by this, the Court of Aldermen petitioned the King to decide upon the affair; but the King referred it to the House of Lords, who, after some delay, ordered that the Commonalty should proceed to the choice of the <num value="2">two</num> Sheriffs, at the same time recommending that they would have those who had already been nominated by the Mayor. The Sheriffs chosen were George Garret and George Clark. Sir William Acton, Bart., was the then Lord Mayor; but he was superseded by the Parliament, and replaced by Sir Edmund Wright.</note> This day y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Lo. Mayor was att the Upper House to get an alteration of that their Lo<hi rend=sup>p<*></hi>
order but the House would not recede from it in any p'ticular, whereat y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Lo. Mayor and cheif cittizens seeme to be much troubled. <pb id="p.56" n="56"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>.</note>

<note place=marg>They came hcere yesternight.</note>

<p>There is here great expectation what recepcon yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi>
Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> will give to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Comittees sent hence. I wishe yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> could have soe tymely expedited yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> affaires there, as that you might have bene reddy to come away before their arrivall there.<note>The names of the Commissioners were Lords Bedford and Howard of Esricke, Hampden, Fiennes, Sir Philip Stapleton, and Sir William Armyne. The Secretary seems to entertain a reasonable fear of the King's being brought into collision with such Commissioners.</note>

<p>Yesterday y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Comons ordered<note>Not recorded in the Parliamentary Debates.</note> that y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> pay of Coll. Willmot, Ashbournham, &amp; y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> rest of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> soldiers (that are questioned in P&lsquo;liam't) shalbe sequestred untill their busines shalbe heard &amp; adjudged. And upon occasion of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> discourse of that busines, Mr. Selden did then in that house deliver his opinion with much confidence, that by y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> ACT OF OBLIVION Mr. Percy and Mr. Jermyn,<note>Jermyn had been especially implicated, by the confession of Colonel Goring, in the alleged plot contrived by certain officers of the army to secure Strafford's escape, and overawe and dissolve the Parliament, by marching the army on London and making the King absolute. Balfour, the Lieutenant of the Tower, bafiled that part of it relating to Strafford; and, a quarrel arising between the leaders of the design, Goring and Wilmot (&ldquo;Gorrein et Hailmot,&rdquo; as Madame de Motteville calls them in her account of the affair), which Jermyn had in vain done his best to reconcile, Goring made a quasi discovery of the plot to Lord Newark, from whom, through Lords Bedford and Kimbolton, it reached Pym. Goring subsequently asserted that for his own part he had refused concurrence with the proposals to put the army into a posture to serve the King, and send a Declaration to Parliament that Episcopacy should not be infringed upon, and that the King's revenue should be established; for he said that he thought it belonged to an army to maintain, not to contrive, acts of state. At the same time he professed that his particular object, in joining in the proposed measures, was to solicit &ldquo;a redresse for the miseries of the souldiers.&rdquo;</note> &amp; all y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> rest that are questioned with them, are freed and pardoned, w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi>
he argued so strongly out of the very words of that Act, as y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> sages of that house, who oppugned his opinion, did not (in y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> iudgem<hi rend=sup>t</hi> of able men) give any reasonable or satisfactory answere to it: the House seemed to be much amazed att this slipp in that <pb id="p.57" n="57"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>.</note>
Act, &amp; were not well pleased with him who delivered this opinion: some said that it was not in y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> intencon of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> House to pardon them, whereupon it was replyed that lawes are to be understood according to the words in y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Act, &amp; not according to the intencon of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> makers, further than y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> words will beare. 
<p>This day the House of Peers have comitted to prison y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> man that printed the scandalous ballet concerning the Qu. Mother's going away, &amp; will consider of further punishm<hi rend=sup>t</hi> for him, and they have ordered that these ballets shalbe burnt by y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> hand of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> hangman.

<p>According to my advertisem<hi rend=sup>t</hi> yesterday, both Houses of Parliam<hi rend=sup>t</hi> have this day adiourned till <datestruct value="20"><year reg="20">20</year></datestruct><hi rend=sup>o</hi>

Octo<hi rend=sup>br</hi> next. They have appoynted Comittees to meete during the recesse,<note>Lists of those Committees may be found in the <num value="9">ninth</num> volume of the Parliamentary History, p. <num value="536">536</num>.</note> &amp; their <num value="1">first</num> day of meeting is to be Tuesday next, &amp; then they are to adiourne from tyme to tyme as they shall thinke good. Their principall busines is to receave &amp; annsweare all le<hi rend=sup>rs</hi> from Scotland, according to instrucc'ons alreddy given to the Comittees there, whom they have power to call home if they see cause. They have also power to send downe monny to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> army, &amp; to doe what they shall think requisite for y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> disbanding of it, &amp; to dispose of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> cannons and artillery in y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> North, &amp; they are to make report of the whole busines att y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> next meeting of both Houses. 
<p>There was not att parting a very p'fect agreem<hi rend=sup>t</hi>
(as I heare) betwene the <num value="2">2</num> Houses in all things, for the Peers declyning to ioyne w<hi rend=sup>th</hi> the Com'ons in orders touching innovac'ons in y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Church, the Com'ons notwithstanding ordered y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> same to be printed, the particulars of w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> orders are here inclosed.<note>The Lords did not quarrel with the spirit of the resolutions of the House of Commons: but they made some slight alterations in the details. The Commons, however, went further on the day before adjournment than they had previously done; for it was ordered that a lecture might be set up, and an orthodox minister maintained, at the expense of any parishioners, to preach on various occasions throughout the week, and also on the Sabbath where there was no sermon.</note> I heare that the Lo<hi rend=sup>ds</hi> &amp; Com'ons have intimated that none of the disbanded soldiers, either horse &amp; foote, Englishe or Irishe, shalbe p'mitted to serve either the ffrench or Spanishe King, but that they may serve the States.<note>This leave to serve the States does not appear on the Parliamentary Records.</note> Upon a report that the Spanish and ffrench<note>Popular prejudice had arisen to a great height against these diplomatic personages; the House of Lords having found it necessary on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct> to issue an order for the punishment of some rioters who had insulted the French Ambassador and his servants.</note> Amb'dors had treated w<hi rend=sup>th</hi> diverse of the horse &amp; foote to serve their masters, <pb id="p.67" n="67"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>.</note>
the Co'mons House sent <num value="2">2</num> of their members to each of their Amb'dors, to know by what warr<hi rend=sup>t</hi> they did goe about to levy any soldiers here, &amp; by whose procurement they obteyned such warr<hi rend=sup>ta</hi>, but (it seemes) they could discover nothing att all. 
<note place=marg>I receaued yours of the <num value="8">8</num>: yesterday, this, this day, but tell my Wife, that in nether of them, there was anie from her.</note>

<p>As soone this day as the L<hi rend=sup>ds</hi> House was adiourned, I receaved from Withering's deputy <num value="2">2</num> packetts of le<hi rend=sup>rs</hi>, y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> <num value="1">one</num> directed to yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> and y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> whole P&lsquo;liam<hi rend=sup>t</hi>, the other to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> L<hi rend=sup>da</hi> in P&lsquo;liam<hi rend=sup>t</hi>; both w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> I have sent now to Mr. Th&lsquo;rer<note>Sir Henry Vane.</note> for yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>.

<p>May it please yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> most excellent Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>, 
<p>Being yesterday at Oatlands to attend the Queenes com'aunds, her Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> gaue me this paper inclos'd, w<hi rend=sup>th</hi>
comaund to send it this day to yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>: it was brought to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Queene by y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Lady Carlile,<note>This was the Dowager Carlisle, Lady Lucy Percy, <num value="2">second</num> wife, and, at this date, widow of James Hay, <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Carlisle; a famous woman in her time, celebrated by Waller and others, and supposed to have become as intimate with Pym as she had previously been with Strafford. Clarendon accuses her of perplexing the King's affairs, and what Nicholas states of her above seems to exhibit an equal readiness to perplex the affairs of Parliament. But, being upwards of <num value="40">forty</num>, she had now perhaps wholly given up amatory for political intrigues.</note> who saith she had it from y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Lo. Mandeville.<note>Son to the <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Manchester of the Montague family, and formerly a personal friend of the King, having accompanied him on his romantic journey to Spain. The nature of the paper here alluded to, may be surmised from the fact that Lord Mandeville was at this time an active member of the Parliament party, and deep in the counsels and confidence of Pym. In the preceding year he had been <num value="1">one</num> of the Commissioners to arrange all causes of dispute with Scotland. He was now best known, however, as the Lord Kimbolton, having at this period been called to the Upper House for his father's barony, though retaining the title of Viscount Mandeville by courtesy. A little later, he was impeached with the <num value="5">five</num> members. His brother, Walter Montague, was a bigoted Catholic priest, Abbot of Pontoise, in France, and Confessor to the Queen after the death of Father Phillips; he is further noticed in subsequent letters.</note> I confesse it were not amise to have it published, but I had rather it should be donne by any other hand than yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi>
or y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Queenes, &amp; therefore I could wishe yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>

<note place=marg>I shall.</note>
would conceale it for a day or <num value="2">2</num>, by w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> tyme I know there wilbe other coppies of it sent into Scotland. 
<p>The late crosse orders, &amp; vnusuall passages in P&lsquo;liam't a little before y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Recesse, are so distastfull to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> wiser sorte, as it hath taken off y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> edge of their confidence in parliamentary proceedings, &amp; I verily beleeve, that if y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Houses (when they next meete) <pb id="p.76" n="76"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>.</note>
shall approove of what was then done, it will loose them y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> reverence that hath bene heretofore paid to Parliame<hi rend=sup>ts</hi>. 
<note place=marg>It were not amiss that some of my seruaunts met lykewais to countermynd ther Plots, to w'ch end speake w'th my Wyfe &amp; receaue her directions.</note>

<p>I heare there are divers meetings att Chelsey att y<hi rend=sup>e</hi>
Lo. Mandevilles house &amp; elsewhere by Pym<note>This was a very short time previous to the City riots, and the affair of the London apprentices. Subsequently the City found it necessary to check those riots, and Venn, <num value="1">one</num> of their members, having exerted himself to keep the peace, a party pamphlet observed that the rioters would have proceeded to the Mansion House, &ldquo;but by the providence of God, and the great wisdom of Captain Ven, they were prevented.&rdquo;</note> and others, to consult what is best to be donne at their next meeting in P&lsquo;liam<hi rend=sup>t</hi>: &amp; I beleeve they will in y<hi rend=sup>e</hi>
<num value="1">first</num> place fall on some plausible thing, that may redintegrate them in y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> people's good opinion, w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> is their anchor-hold &amp; only interest; &amp; (if I am not much misinformed) that wilbe either vpon Papists, or vpon some Act for expunging of Officers and Counsellors here according to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Scottish p<hi rend=sup>e</hi>cedent, or on both together, &amp; therefore it will import yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi>
Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>, by some serious and faithfull advise, to doe some thing to anticipate or prevent them before their next meeting. 
<p>Yesterday at Oatlands I understood that S<hi rend=sup>r</hi>. Jo. Berkeley &amp; Capt. O&lsquo;Neale<note>O&lsquo;Neale was deeply implicated in what was called the Army Plot; the conspiracy for bringing up the English army against the Parliament, before referred to (<hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="56">56</num>), in which Percy, Wilmot, Goring, Ashburnham, and several others were engaged. May, in his <hi rend=italics>History of the Parliament</hi>, p. <num value="65">65</num> (Mason's edition), calls O&lsquo;Neale an Irishman and a Papist; and states that he was committed to the Tower, but escaped before trial. Berkeley was an officer of high rank, always active in the King's service, and is repeatedly mentioned by Clarendon, particularly as Governor of Exeter which he was obliged to surrender to the Parliamentary forces.</note> were come over, &amp; that they had bene the day before privately at Waybridge: I was bould then to deliver my opinion to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Queene, that I did beleeve if they continued in England they would be arrested (thoughe y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> P&lsquo;liam't sit not) by vertue of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> warrant, that was given att <num value="1">first</num> to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Sarjant at Armes (attending y<hi rend=sup>e</hi>

<p>May it please yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> most excell<hi rend=sup>nt</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>, 
<p>These inclosed from y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Queene &amp; my Lo. Keeper were brought to me y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> last night late to be sent to yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>.

<note place=marg><*> may see by this that all their desynes hit not, &amp; I hope before all be done that they shall miss of more.<note>From this, and the similar covert threats in the margin of the letter preceding, as well as in others that follow, it is obvious that the King now believed himself in possession of facts involving the probable overthrow of the popular leaders.</note></note>

<p>The partie here, who we say hath y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> best intelligence from Scotland (w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> is Mr. Pym &amp; young S<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Hen.

<p>I hear Mr. Th&lsquo;rer is still at Raby,<note>His own country seat.</note> &amp; that he will not returne to Scotl. before yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> coming thence, w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> makes me humbly to craue yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi>

<p>I assure yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> it is here resolved (if my intelligence doth not much deceaue me) to presse yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi>
Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>, at y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> next meeting in P&lsquo;liam<hi rend=sup>t</hi> for y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> like Act touching y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> elecc'on of officers and Councellors here,

<p>May it please yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> most excell<hi rend=sup>nt</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>, 
<p>Yesterday I receaved yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> com'ands by an apostile vpon my le<hi rend=sup>r</hi> of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> <num value="24">24</num><hi rend=sup>th</hi> of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> last moneth, &amp; forthw<hi rend=sup>th</hi> p<hi rend=sup>e</hi>sented yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Queene, and sent that to my Lo.

<p>It hath bene here confidently said, by those that holde correspondency w<hi rend=sup>th</hi> y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Engl.

they will settle yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> returne, &amp; nothing can brake their designes here but yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> presence; &amp; if yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> do not hasten to be here some dayes before ye next meeting in Parliam<hi rend=sup>t</hi>, I doubt there wilbe few that will dare to appeare here to oppose y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> party that now swayeth; &amp; I pray God there be not some designe in deteyning yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> there till yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> affaires here be reduced to the same state they there are in. I assure yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> opinion of wise men here is, that to have what officers you desire in that kingdome cannot make soe much for your service there, as yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> absence hence at this tyme will preiudice you in businesses of more importaunce here: and as for the Lo.

<p>I am credibly assured, that y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Citty of London growes very weary of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> insolent carriage of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi>
Schismaticks, finding their way of governm<hi rend=sup>t</hi> to be wholly arbitrary. Alderman Gourney [Gurney] (according to his right and place) is elected Lo.

<p>May it please yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> most excellent Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>, 
<p>Yesterday I sent to yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> in myne a let'r from my Lo<hi rend=sup>d</hi> Keeper by packet: and this is to give yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi>

<note place=marg>I have done this alreddie</note>
Justices, forthw<hi rend=sup>th</hi> to set forth a proclamac'on to that purpose: &amp; another by the way of West Chester or thereabouts, least y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> former should miscarry or receave delay. The Lo<hi rend=sup>dds</hi> of yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> Privy Councell here have also this day giuen order to the Justices of Peace (in &amp; neeere London) to take a course, that a more effectuall and strict order be taken for present sending away all y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> disbanded souldiers (w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> still pester this city): &amp; for shutting up of all houses <pb id="p.88" n="88">

infected, for that y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> sicknes disperseth very much &amp; dangerously hereabouts. 
<p>There was this day nothing donne by the Comittees of either House worthy yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> notice. There is a strong report (spred by persons of best creddit here for intelligence &amp; knowledge of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> proceedings in Scotl:) that yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> will not be here these <num value="2">2</num> moneths, but what ground they have for it, I cannot learne. 
<p>There is a whispering here, as if yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Parliam<hi rend=sup>t</hi> (when it meetes) would adiourne for some moneths, or to some other place: I tould my Lo: Keeper this day that if y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> P&lsquo;liam<hi rend=sup>t</hi> should adiourne to a further day, (thoughe 
<note place=marg>I would not have that intention hindered, Cambridge would be best.</note>
but for a moneth or <num value="2">two</num>) before they passed y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Bill of Tonnage &amp; Poundage to yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>, (the same being graunted only to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> <num value="1">first</num> of Decem: next.) it would put yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> to a great streight for want of monny to uphold yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> house, &amp; for divers other occasions: and 
<note place=marg>For this, I would haue you consult with the Keeper &amp; others of my seruants what to doe in it, leaving it to your discretions to doe as you shall see cause, but I would have the adjurnement furthured by anie meanes. As I haue beene sufficientlie slandered heere in sume respects, so there also I heere that I haue not mist those good offices, though in an other kynde, as being resolved, at my retorne, to alter the forme of the Churche gouernement in England to this heere: therfor I com'and you to asseure all my seruants there that I am constant for the Doctrine &amp; Disepline of the Churche of England as it was established by Queene Elis &amp; my Father &amp; resolues (by the grace of God) to liue &amp; dey in the maintenance of it.</note>
I humbly offer it to yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> considerac'on, whether it may not be fitt for you to let my Lo: Keeper, &amp; some other of yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> best affected servaunts of either House of P&lsquo;liam<hi rend=sup>t</hi> know, what you would have them to insist upon in case there should be any moc'on for a further adiournem<hi rend=sup>t</hi>, before yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi>

<p>May it please yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> most excellent Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>,

vaunts here, then it is almost impossible for such yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi>

<note place=marg>It will be well done.</note>

<p>This inclosed is y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> let<hi rend=sup>r</hi> from y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Lo<hi rend=sup>dds</hi> of yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi>
Privy Counsell, whereof in my last by Mr. Mungo Murrey<note>Murrey (Mungo) was a confidential servant and gentleman of the bedchamber to the King, who often entrusted him with private correspondence. In <datestruct VALUE="1646-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct>, whilst the King was in the power of the English Commissioners at Newcastle, Murrey, having obtained leave of absence on pretence of visiting Scotland, was admitted to his Majesty's presence before witnesses for the purpose of kissing his hand. The Commissioners, however, observed something put into his hand by the King; and having followed him, when out of the presence, they searched him, and found a letter in cypher directed to Montreuil the French agent. The letter was immediately sent up to the Parliament, and Murrey committed to prison, but admitted to bail after <num value="2">two</num> days' confinement.</note> I sent a coppy: their Lo<hi rend=sup>pps</hi>, as soon as they rose from Councell, (&amp; before y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> let<hi rend=sup>r</hi> was drawne) dispersed themselves to their severall homes in y<hi rend=sup>e</hi>
country, w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> is y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> cause (as I am tould), that it was <pb id="p.90" n="90"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>.</note>
this day before it was brought signed to me for yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi>
Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>. The more secreey and expedic'on there is used in dispatch of yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> let<hi rend=sup>r</hi> to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Lo<hi rend=sup>dds</hi> Justices (if you shall approove of their Lo<hi rend=sup>pps</hi> advise) y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> better, &amp; that made me p<hi rend=sup>e</hi>sume to hasten to yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> y<hi rend=sup>e</hi>
coppy, before y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> let<hi rend=sup>r</hi> itself was signed. I finde that y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Com'ttees of both Houses (by reason of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> contynuaunce of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> sicknes) incline to be very earnest, when y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Parliam<hi rend=sup>t</hi> meets next, to perswade a further adiournem<hi rend=sup>t</hi> for a tyme, but Mr. Pym, &amp; those of his

party, will not heare that y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> P&lsquo;liam<hi rend=sup>t</hi> shalbe held any where but in London or Westminster: I hope yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi>
Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> (if you shall stay there past y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> <num value="18">18th</num> present) will send some direcc'ons to yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> servaunts here how to apply their endeavours in P&lsquo;liam<hi rend=sup>t</hi>, in case there shalbe any debate touching an adiournem<hi rend=sup>t</hi>. 
<note place=marg>I haue syned it, &amp; therefor see that it be imediatlie sent ouer, for tell my Wyfe that I shall loose no tyme in sending to Sr Will: Boswell<note>Boswell seems to have been an old confidential servant of the King, who mentions him as his agent in <datestruct value="1634--"><year reg="1634">1634</year></datestruct>, in a letter to the Queen of Bohemia.

said Collar, for it is apparent, that these merchaunts dare not have a hand in the engaging of it, but they say they will take order that, upon receipt of yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> warraunt, it shalbe safely delivered accordingly.

Lord Lanerick's (or Lanark's) relation of it may be seen in Hardwicke's State Papers, vol. ii. p. <num value="299">299</num>, wherein he asserts that there was a plan laid, by the opposite party, to cut the throats of himself and the <num value="2">two</num> Lords mentioned in this letter; and he adds, that their &ldquo;abandoning the Court and Parliament&rdquo; was literally nothing more than quitting Edinburgh in order to save their lives. All that is absolutely known in the matter is, that Charles had summoned these <num value="3">three</num> Lords to attend his Court; but that they not only absented themselves, but quitted the city, and placed their houses in a state of defence; and that on the King demanding an investigation to clear his honour, a secret committee of the Scotch Parliament made a report in exculpation of his Majesty, but justifying the <num value="3">three</num> Lords in the course they had taken. Clarendon says that Montrose had advised and &ldquo;frankly&rdquo; undertaken the assassination of Hamilton, his brother Lanerick, and Argyle; and whatever reception may have been given to this proposal (which there is no ground for thinking that the King for a moment sanctioned), it is hardly to be doubted that schemes were now on foot between Montrose and Charles, embracing a simultaneous movement in the <num value="3">three</num> kingdoms, and sufficiently explaining the alarm and excitement of the Parliamentary leaders, especially on the sudden breaking out of the Irish rebellion. It should be added that the friends of Montrose strenuously assert, in opposition to the statement of Clarendon, that his secret proposal to the King was not for the murder, but simply for the arrest, of Argyle and the Hamiltons.</note> our Com'ittee here was yesterday in a great fright, &amp; <pb id="p.92" n="92">

<p>I have, inclosed, sent yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> coppy of an order<note>A conference took place on this subject between the <num value="2">two</num> Houses, wherein it was urged that the Prince had recently been often at the Queen's residence at Oatlands; and though the Commons did not doubt the motherly affection and care of her Majesty towards him, yet there were some dangerous persons at Oatlands, Jesuits and others, and therefore it was desired that the Marquis of Hertford should be enjoined to take the Prince into his custody and charge, attending upon him in person, and also that the Prince would make his ordinary abode and residence at his own house at Richmond. To this it was added, that Lord Hertford should place some person about the Prince to be answerable to both Houses; so that, in fact, the Prince would have been a complete prisoner. When the message was sent to the Queen, she made answer that the Prince was celebrating his Sister's birthday.</note> of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Parliam<hi rend=sup>t</hi> concerning their abundant care of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Princes highnes safety and education, the reasons thereof were delivered at Oatlands by my Lo. of Holland<note>Henry Rich, <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Holland (and <num value="2">second</num> son of the Earl of Warwick), so created by James the <num value="1">First</num>, in <datestruct value="1624--"><year reg="1624">1624</year></datestruct>. He is recorded in the <hi rend=italics>Loyal Martyrologie</hi> by Winstanley, as a special favourite of Charles in the early part of his reign, being them Governor of Windsor Castle: yet, after that date, says Winstanley, &ldquo;when the Long Parliament began to sit, and religion became the bone of contention, he sided with them; but afterwards perceiving that they made religion only a cloak to cover their rebellion, he deserted them, and took up armes for the Royal interest.&rdquo; Being defeated and taken prisoner, he suffered on the same scaffold with the Duke of Hamilton and Lord Capel, on the <datestruct VALUE="1648-03-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct>. In the charge of his siding with the Parliament, Winstanley goes further than Dugdale, and those writers who copy from him; the latter asserting only that the favours heaped on Holland by Charles made that Earl so fearful of the Parliament's enmity as to induce him not only to stand neutral himself, but also to persuade the Earl of Essex, his near kinsman, and Lord Chamberlain, to desert his Royal Master when forced to fly from Whitehall. De Larrey, a French historian, says of him that he possessed greater genius than his brother, Lord Warwick, who was &ldquo;a person of an agreeable wit, perhaps a little too much libertine, but knew very well how to dissemble, and imposed on the people by an affected devotion, and going regularly to sermons.&rdquo;</note> to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Queene, who (I heare) gave <pb id="p.106" n="106">

a very wise and discreete answeare to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> same, as (I beleeve) her owne pen will very speedily acquaint yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>. 
<p>It is said there is a new designe discovered of a later intenc'on then Mr. Percyes to have debauched y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> late Army, but what it is I cannot learne. My Lo.

<p>May it please yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> most excellent Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>, 
<p>This is y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> <num value="1">first</num> day since my falling sick, that I have bene able to sit vp to write: &amp; albeit I shall doe it w<hi rend=sup>th</hi> some difficulty, yet my duty will not suffer me to forbeare any longer to give yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi>
Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> an accompt, that by Mr. Barkley I receaved on Sunday night last yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> comaunds in <num value="3">3</num> apostiles dated y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> <num value="9">9</num><hi rend=sup>th</hi> of this moneth: All w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> I have alreddy p&lsquo;form'd, excepting that concerning giving notice to my Lord Mayor of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> day of yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi>
Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> entring into London, whereof (I beleeve) I shall this afternoone have certeynty from the Queene. 
<p>Herew<hi rend=sup>th</hi> yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> will receave a proclamac'on for y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> attendance of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Parliam<hi rend=sup>t</hi> men, w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> my Lo: Keeper &amp; Mr. Attorney conceaved would have bene better to have beneforborne to be published till yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> returne, w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> is now so neere in expectac'on.

<p>The order of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> House of Com'ons for y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> number of Scots to be sent into Irland, was altered from <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct>, to <num value="5000">5000</num>. vpon Saturday last in y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> afternoone, &amp; thoughe (wee heare) that y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> imploym<hi rend=sup>t</hi> of soe many Scots wilbe very acceptable to that nac'on, yet it is here apprehended by wise men, that y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> same will exasperate y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Irishe, &amp; make them buckle more resolutely to a warre of rebellion, then otherwise they would doe.

Mr. Pym<note>Plots against the life of Pym were rife at this time. Among the parliamentary chiefs he was the most prominent mark for such attempts, and many appear to have been undertaken. &ldquo;He seemed to all men,&rdquo; says Clarendon, &ldquo;to have the greatest influence upon the House of Commons of any man; and, in truth, I think he was the most popular man, and the most able to do hurt, that hath lived in any time.&rdquo; The <num value="1">first</num> of the plots referred to by Nicholas was a strange <num value="1">one</num>. The plague still lingered in various places in and near London; and it would seem that as the popular leader entered the House of Commons <num value="1">one</num> day, the porter of the House delivered to him a letter (received from &ldquo;a gentleman on horseback, in a grey coat, who gave him twelvepence for the speedy delivery of it&rdquo;), from which, on his opening it, there dropped a covering which had come from a plague wound; the letter itself containing &ldquo;many menaces and much railing against him.&rdquo;</note> a le<hi rend=sup>tr</hi> w<hi rend=sup>th</hi> a plaster and a threatening in it, there was on Munday last in y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> evening, another as desperate and dangerous a conspiracy against him, &amp; diverse members of both Houses, discovered by a poore zealous taylor, who, being in y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> fields mending y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> notes he had taken of a sermon, there happened to come (as he relates it) <num value="2">2</num>. souldier-like men, soe neere him, as he overheard them telling each other, how many of their acquaintance were to be forthw<hi rend=sup>th</hi>

<p>Yesterday I wrote to yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>, &amp; addressed it by packet to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> D. of Richmond, as yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> co'manded me when you should be on yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> returne: since that, I have receaved from y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Queene <num value="3">3</num> of my l'trs, all of them apostiled by yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> <num value="13">13</num><hi rend=sup>th</hi> of this moneth, &amp; I humbly acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> for yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> grac'ous goodnes in returning and burning my l'trs. I shall carefully obey all yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> com'aunds in those l'trs.

Royall assent for y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> B<hi rend=sup>pp</hi> of Lincolne<note>John Williams, D.D. Dean of Westminster, and formerly Lord Keeper.

<p>The business against O&lsquo;Neale is referred to a select Com'ittee to be p<hi rend=sup>e</hi>pared reddy for y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> House against Munday next, &amp; some thinke it wilbe hardly heard then, for albeit y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Com'ons haue a very good minde to proceede roundly against him, yet (I heare) y<hi rend=sup>e</hi>

When the war broke out, Goring, as Governor of Portsmouth, declared for the King; but that town, being unable to sustain a siege, was soon lost to the Royal Cause. Goring then went to France, as Bulstrode says, with the money he had received on both sides, &ldquo;without making good his promises to either.&rdquo; That Author adds, that &ldquo;if his conscience and integrity had equalled his wit and courage, he had been <num value="1">one</num> of the most eminent men of the age he lived in; but he could not resist temptations, and was a man without scruple, and loved no man so well, but he would cozen him, and afterwards laugh at him.&rdquo; Goring's high command in the army, and subsequent court-favour, are supposed to have been occasioned in a great measure by the very active assistance he afforded to the Queen, whilst in France, in procuring both money and arms.</note> The Com'ons have bene in <pb id="p.133" n="133">

It appears by the above letter that Nicholas had been informed of Hyde's intention to make this attempt. Hampden's motion was not carried till <num value="2">two</num> o'clock, and after a scene of extraordinary excitement (in which bloodshed was only prevented, according to Sir Philip Warwick, &ldquo;by the sagacity and great calmness of Mr. Hampden&rdquo;) the House adjourned at <num value="3">three</num> o'clock.

In some old Tracts of that period we find also recorded &ldquo;<num value="5">Five</num> most noble Speeches&rdquo; spoken to his Majesty by the mayors of several cities on his route homeward.

<p>Nicholas, as I haue hitherto approued of your proceedings, so I will nott now censure them: since upon the place, you may have founde such reasons as you haue not fully expressed to me: but, to deale freely, I could haue wished, that ye had used more reseruation concerning the Militia: for though I could be content to buy Peace at the rate ye haue sett downe, yet ye might haue reserued something to <pb id="p.138" n="138">

<salute>The King to Prince Rupert.</salute>

<dateline>TICKNILL<note><p>Tickenhall, near Bewdley. Whilst Charles was here, he I aid a formal visit to Bewdley, the Corporation having previously met to determine upon the mode of receiving the Royal visit. The charges are entered upon the Town Books; and it appears that the sum of <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> was expended in repairing the Corporation Pew in the Church, and sixpence for sweeping out that sacred edifice; making in all the grand total of <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence sterling. 
<p>In a very minute account of the King's affairs at this period, written by Sir Edward Walker, Garter King at Arms, and preserved in the Harleian Collection, No. <num value="4229">4229</num>, it is stated that the King arrived at Bewdley on the <num value="12">12th</num>; after having made that very arduous and judicious retreat from Oxfordshire, in which he evaded the pursuit of both Essex and Waller, by forced marches over the country between Witney and Worcester, along what was afterwards the Cheltenham road. The march upon Bewdley is said by Sir Edward to have been made with the intent of saving Worcester from a siege, of drawing Waller further from London, and also of enticing him into a difficult country, where the King's army, then without artillery or heavy baggage, might obtain considerable advantage over him. Waller, however, avoided the western side of the Severn, and fixed his head-quarters at Bromsgrove, contenting himself with advancing a small body of horse to Kidderminster, the &ldquo;Foreign&rdquo; of which town, as it is called, reaches to the eastern end of Bewdley Bridge. The King's foot were all in Bewdley on the <num value="14">14th</num>, and the horse quartered along the Severn towards Bridgenorth. 
<p>The King was so much aware of the delicacy of his situation at this moment, that on the day preceding the date of the letter in the text, he had formed a Council of War, directing them to meet every day and report their proceedings in respect to forming a plan of retreat, either into Wales or upon Shrewsbury; and on this day the Council and King determined to retreat back to Worcester, and so on to Evesham. He was closely followed by Waller; but, immediately after this date, eluded him so far as to reach Daventry before him, and finally he defeated Waller at Cropredy bridge, on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>. 
<p>At the date of his letter the King had got intelligence that York was besieged by the Scottish army (just before the battle of Marston Moor), and that the Scots had been also joined by Fairfax and Lord Manchester. This fact explains the military orders given in it, which are perfectly in consonance with the existing accounts of Prince Rupert's conduct previous to that battle. It may be remarked, however, that Bulstrode, as well as others, brings an accusation against Rupert for fighting the Parliamentary forces after raising the siege; but the express words of the King imply a desire not only for the relief of York, but also for a battle with the enemy; else why did he allude to &ldquo;beating the Rebel armies&rdquo; as a means of enabling him to spin out time? This is a most important fact in the history of the Civil Wars; for the Marquis of Neweastle, and other general officers, were so disgusted with the Prince for fighting against or without orders, as they supposed, that they left England immediately, going to Hamburgh, and thereby the whole of the north was lost to the King's cause. The letter in the text is a copy, but it presents no material discrepancy from the original, which has since been printed in Mr. Foster's <hi rend=italics>Statesmen of the Commonwealth</hi>, vol. iv. pp. <num value="129">129</num>, <num value="130">130</num>.</note> <datestruct VALUE="1644-06-14"><day reg="14">14</day> <month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1644">1644</year></datestruct>.

Bulstrode says that he wrote the General's reply, in which Charles was urged to act upon the defensive until Taunton should be taken; but he hints some strong suspicions of Goring being actuated by sinister views. The whole passage is curious. See Bulstrode's

So little had he been conscious of the approach of the enemy, that on the previous day he had been hunting, and what he designed for the morrow (the fatal day of naseby) we observe by the letter in the text.</note> I marche <pb id="p.152" n="152">

<salute>The King to Sir Edward Nicholas.<note>This letter is without date of place; but by means of it, and several of the subsequent ones, we mark the King's route between the battle of Naseby and his arrival at Newark; a space of time during which Bulstrode describes him as &ldquo;flying from place to place, not well knowing which way to turn himself.&rdquo; It is evident, notwithstanding, that he had specific plans in view; on account of which he visited Wales, Shropshire, and afterwards Huntingdon and Yorkshire, before he proceeded to Newark.</note></salute>

<p>Nicholas, I receaued yesterday bothe of your letters (for I perceaue by their markes, that you haue yet written no more) with the advertisments from London, w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> as you say is worthy my notice, but without considering make this answer, that the just contrary, concerning the new discouery of my Com'ission in a letter to the <num value="2">two</num> Queenes<note>Queen Henrietta Maria, and her mother the Queen of France, the widow of Henry IV.</note> about the Irishe Papists, is trew: for indeed that roag Hartogen made such a foolishe proposition, but it was flatly denyed by me, &amp; (if my memory much faile me not) my Wyfe tooke occasion upon some clause in my answer, wherby it semed to her (in w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> she was mistaken) as if I thought she had lyke the proposition, to disclaime any parte in it (so far from aprobation) but only the transmitting of it to me, w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> certainly was not fitt for her to refuse: &amp; this (with many other ansome expressions of her affection to me, euen to the ventring of being thought a Protestant in condemning the Irish proceedings) was, as I beliue, in that letter w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> Tom Elliot deliuered me from her, as I was marching over Broadway Hills the <datestruct VALUE="-05-9"><day reg="9">9</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct> last; for I am sure the most of that letter was concerning the Irish business, &amp; I know the reason why the Rebelles haue not printed it is, because it cleers that point more then any of those betweene vs, w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> are published: That all this is trew, &amp; that the Rebelles haue all this under my Wyfes hand &amp; myne, I comand you to affirme positiuely in my name upon all occasions of this subject: but it is possible that all I mention to be, is not in the letter Tom Elliot brought me (though I am sure most is), but then it is in some other.

<p>Nicholas, 
<p>When you shall have considered the strange and most inexcusable deliverye vpp of the Castle and Fort of Bristoll,<note>Alluded to in the preceding letter.</note> and compared it with those many precedinge aduertisments w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> have been giuen mee, I make noe doubt, but you and all my Counsell there will conclude that I could doe noe lesse, then what you will find heere inclosed, in my care of the preseruation of my Sonne, of all you my faithfull servaunts there, and of that important place, my Citty of Oxford. In the <num value="1">first</num> place you will finde a coppy of my letter to my nephew; secondly, a reuocation of his commission of Generall; thirdlye, a warrant to Lieutenant Coll&lsquo; Hamilton to exercise the charge of iLeutenant Gouernor of Oxford in Sir <pb id="p.164" n="164">

Thomas Glemhams<note>The King appears to have reposed great confidence in Sir Thomas Glemham, notwithstanding his surrender of Carlisle on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct> preceding; which, however, had not taken place till after a long siege, and when he had reason finally to despair of succour. Indeed he had distinguished himself, from the <num value="1">first</num>, in the Royal Cause; having been <num value="2">second</num> in command in Yorkshire, under the Earl of Cumberland</note> absence; fourthly, a warrant to the sayd Lieutenant Colonell Hamilton to apprehend the person of Will: Legge<note>This is a piece of private history not noticed in the Peerage; but it is right to add that the King's suspicions of his old and faithful friend, the ancestor of the present family of Dartmouth, were subsequently ascertained to be without the slightest foundation.</note> present Gouernour of Oxford; and lastlye, a warrant to be directed to what person shall bee thought fittest for the apprehendinge my Nephew Rupert, in case of such extreamitye as shall bee hereafter specifyed, and not otherwise. As for the circumstances and the timinge of the execution of all these particulars, as farr forth as they may admitt of some howres delay more or lesse, I must referr it to my Lord Treasurers<note>Sir John Culpepper.</note> care and yours to aduise of, vpon the place, how it may be done with most securitye, and accordinglye to direct the manner of proceedinge. But yett I shall tell you my opinion as farr forth as I can judge at this distance, w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> is, that you should beginne with securing the person of Will: Legge, before any thing be declared concerninge my Nephew. But that once done, then the sooner you declare to the Lords both the revokinge of my Nephews commission, and my makinge S<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Thomas Glemham Gouernour of Oxford, the better. As for the deliuery of my letter to my Nepheu, if hee bee at Oxford, I take the proper time for that to be as soone as possiblye may bee after the securinge of Will: Legge. But if my Nepheu be not there, I would then haue you hasten my letter unto him, and in the meane time putt the rest in execution. 
<p>The warrant for my Nephews commitment is onlye that you may haue the power to doe it, if it <pb id="p.165" n="165"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1645--"><year reg="1645">1645</year></datestruct>.</note>
stead of submittinge to, and obeyinge my commaunds in goinge beyond sea, you shall finde that hee practise the raysinge of mutinye or any other disturbance in that place, or any other, in w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> case the sayd warrant for his committment is to bee deliuered unto whome you and my Lord Treasurer shall thinke fittest for it to be directed unto, and by that person to be putt in execution. Lastlye I enjoyne you the care to lett all the Lords know, that whateuer is done in this kinde, is out of my tender regard of their safetye and preseruation, and that they shall speedilye receiue for their satisfaction a particular account of the reasons of this necessarye proceedinge.

<salute>Copie of Pr: Ruperts &amp;c. Petition deliuered at 
<lb>Newarke.<note>The affair that gave rise to this Petition deserves notice. The King having at this moment gone to Newark, as a place of the best security, some differences of opinion arose among his confidential officers respecting the defeat of Lord Digby at Sherborne, which General Gerard asserted to be the result of treason. Digby's character, however, was supported by Bellasis, the Governor, and several others; but the Princes, Rupert and Maurice, sided with Gerard. At length swords were drawn, and the King rushed in to part them; but when it was found that his opinion was in favour of Digby, Prince Rupert, and <num value="400">400</num> of that party, actually threw up their commissions, as Burton declares in his Civil Wars. This Petition now printed, however, seems to imply positively that their commissions were taken from them. There appears a strange inconsistency in the accounts given of these affairs by the various contemporary writers of the period. The curious reader will find much amusement in referring to Bulstrode's

Consider well, whether the season is not proper for this designe, when the wealth of this nation is already so exhausted, and the sufferings of the people soe great, that they are no longer to be supported. This is reason, tis not to cast a bone amongst you: The only remedye is (and it is a safe and honourable <num value="1">one</num> for you) that you sett your selfe, the gentleman that was quartered with you, and all his and your freinds to preuaile, that the King may come to London vpon the termes he hath offered; where, if Presbitery shall be soe strongly insisted vpon as that there can be noe peace without itt, you shall certainly haue all the power my master cann make to ioyne with you in rooting out of this kingdome that tyrannicall Gouernment; with this condition, that my master may not haue his conscience disturbed (yours being free) when that easy worke is finished.

<p>S<hi rend=sup>r</hi>, 
<p>I shall only add this word to what was said in my last: that you hasten my business all that possibly you cann; the occasion lately giuen being fairer than euer, and donn on purpose. Be very confident that all things shall be performed according to my promise. By all that is good, I coniure you, to dispatch that curtoysye for me with all speed, or it will be too late, I shall perish before I receiue the fruits of itt. I may not tell you my necessityes, but if it were necessary soe to doe, I am sure you would lay all other considerations aside, and fulfill my desires. This is all: trust me, I will repay your fauour to the full. I have donn. If I haue not an answeare within foure dayes after the receipt of this, I shall be necessitated to finde some other expedient. God direct you, I haue discharged my dutye. (<hi rend=italics>Not signed.</hi>) 
<p>Written at the bottom of this letter by the King. 
<p>&ldquo;This is a true Copie of what was sent by jack Asheburnham &amp; my comand to Sir Henry Vane the younger. C. R.&rdquo; 
<p><hi rend=italics>The King's promise to Mons. de Montreuil concerning those that should come with him to the Scots Army.</hi>

<p>I do promise to Mounsieur de Montreull, that none shall come with me to the Scots army, or meet me there, who are excepted by those att London, but only my <num value="2">two</num> nepheues, and Jack Ashburnham.<note>The King's confidence in Ashburnham was very great at this crisis. But a very short time before, he was obliged, by the approach of Fairfax, to escape from Oxford in disguise; and this he did as the servant of Ashburnham: after which he joined the Scottish army before Newark. Yet Ashburnham is accused of having misled the King when he was taken prisoner in <datestruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct>, either through treachery or folly. Bulstrode (in his <hi rend=italics>Memoirs</hi>) asserts that when Charles arrived in great privacy at the house of Lady Southampton, and Ashburnham went up stairs to the King's bed-chamber to announce to him that Colonel Hammond was below at supper, and had given assurance for his Majesty's safety, but not of liberty for his person, the King instantly, with much emotion, struck his hand upon his breast, exclaiming, &ldquo;And is this all! Then I am betrayed!&rdquo;</note>
 <pb id="p.175" n="175"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1646--"><year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct>.</note>
Notwithstanding, the said Montreull is to receaue this my protestation, that all my seruants, and all others who doe adheare to me, shalbe saved from ruine, or any publique dishonour; which is a condition that my wife writt to me that not only she, but likewise Cardinall Mazarine,<note>Mazarine had recently become Prime Minister of France, in consequence of the death of Richelieu. The latter bore an implacable malice and hatred to England for her interference respecting the French Protestants, particularly in the affairs of the Isle du Rhe, and Rochelle. It is curious to compare this opinion of Mazarine with the well-authenticated fact that, notwithstanding his outward appearance of friendship for the King, he was keeping up a good correspondence with the Parliament through the medium of Don Alonzo de Cardenas, the Spanish Ambassador.</note> were absolutely of opinion that I was sooner to dye, than not to haue. As for Church Gouernement, as I haue already, soe I now againe promise, that as-soone as I come into the Scotts army, I shall be very willing to be instructed concerning the presbiteriall gouernement: whereupon they shall see, that I shall striue to content them in any thing, that shall not be against my conscience.

<p>Nicholas, since my last I had neither sufficient tyme nor matter to write to you, but now I haue enough of either, yet I shall to ease both our paynes, contract my thoughts, merely to what is (for the present) necessary for you att Oxford.<note>Oxford was at this moment nearly reduced; so that Sir Thomas Glemham, the Governor, in answer to a summons, asked permission to send a messenger to the King for orders. This, however, was refused by Fairfax, and the city was delivered up, but not until after a treaty of some weeks' continuance. The actual date of the surrender was the <datestruct VALUE="-06-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>. The facts contained in the indorsements possess considerable interest for the future historian. When this letter was written, the King was with the Scottish army, who had retreated thus far after the surrender of Newark to the Parliament. In Herbert's <hi rend=italics>Memoirs of the <num value="2">Two</num> last years of Charles the <num value="1">First</num></hi> there is an allusion to the King's consent, through the Lords of the Privy Council then at Oxford.</note> ffor directions then, know that you are not to expect releefe, so that I giue you leaue to treate for good condic'ons. Let those of Exeter be your example: the additions must be the taking care particularly of the University, and to trye if you can gett the Duke of Yorke to be sent hither to me, as alsoe all my seruaunts who wilbe willing to come (of w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> number I am sure you are <num value="1">one</num>) but feare you will not get leaue, and those goods w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> I haue there. 
<p>These directions I would haue you keepe very secreat, that you may make better conditions: ffor the number and choyce, I leave to the Lordes discrec'ons (the gouernor being <num value="1">one</num>), but you must give out that releefe will come. Jack Ashburnham is this day gonne for ffraunce. I haue no more to say, so I rest

<p>There is noe meanes to raiseany considerable forces for an army ag<hi rend=sup>t</hi> y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> next Spring: for that all Wales was lost p<hi rend=sup>e</hi>sently after y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> losse of Bristoll, and since that, Munmouth &amp; Hereford.

<head>Correspondence of Sir Edward Nicholas and the Royal Family, After the Death of Charles I.</head>

<p>THE subjoined letters, in continuation of the preceding correspondence, will be found to require little illustrative comment. They embrace the brief and unsuccessful royalist campaign which closed on the field of Worcester; they contain illustrations of Charles the <num value="2">Second</num>'s distrust and dislike of his Presbyterian friends and supporters; but they derive perhaps their chief interest from the gossiping details in which the deceased King's sister, Elizabeth of Bohemia, so largely indulges, and in which the fears and jealousies, the enjoyments and privations of the Exiles, the fluctuation of her nephew's hopes, Cromwell's assumption of power, the vagaries of the errant Queen of Sweden, the attempts of the Queen-mother Henrietta to make Roman Catholics of her children, and the childhood of that young Prince of Orange for whom those attempts were preparing a throne, are curiously and impartially mixed up The letter of earnest remonstrance to the Duke of Gloucester, &ldquo;concerning his being tempted to turne papist,&rdquo; bearing the signature of his elder brother, is a somewhat strange comment on the faith in which charles the <num value="2">Second</num> died.

<dateline>PARIS,<note>Charles, at the period of his father's death, was at the Hague with his brother in law, the Prince of Orange; after which he went to France to join his mother; but having been proclaimed King throughout Ireland, with the exception of Dublin and Londonderry, he would have proceeded there, had he not been forewarned that such a procedure would produce much alarm among the Protestant friends to his cause. He therefore went no farther than Jersey, where he was proclaimed King, a short time previous to the date of this Remonstrance. To what Courtier or Minister about Charles's person it was addressed, does not appear; but it was written by Sir Edward Nicholas during his retreat from England, after the death of his royal master. He appears at its date to have been resident with his relative, Sir Richard Browne, who still remained Charg&eacute; d&lsquo;Affaires at the French Court.</note> <datestruct VALUE="1649-11-6"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=6>6</day>, <year reg=1649>1649</year></datestruct>.

<p>May it please yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>.<note>Written by Sir Edward Nicholas, and alluded to in a note, <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="184">184</num>.</note>

<p>I came to yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> out of duty to serve you if I could, not out of designe to gaine preferment, &amp; thoughe I understood well, that yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> Privy Councell here was neither of number or weight equall to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> importaunce of yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> affaires, yet yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi>
Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> being then resolved to goe for Irland (where I conceaved there would be an addition of Councellors answearable to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> weight of yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> aff<hi rend=sup>res</hi>) I did y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> more willingly tender my humble services here. 
<p>But since its not now councellable for yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>
upon y<hi rend=sup>r</hi> change of yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> busines in Irla: to goe thither, I held it my duty humbly to advise you, that I find yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi>
affa<hi rend=sup>res</hi> of soe great importaunce, &amp; of such a nature, as (in my poore iudgem<hi rend=sup>t</hi>) it will not be possible for you to man'age y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> same w<hi rend=sup>th</hi>out a steddy, setled, &amp; <pb id="p.192" n="192">

<note place=marg>D. Richmond Ea: Arundell Ea: Derby Ea: Norwich E. South'ton Sir Art. Hopton, Mr. Cha. Exch. L&lsquo;d Hatton.</note>
more full Councell of able, graue &amp; experienced p&lsquo;sons of unblemished integrity, whose honor, esteeme, fidellity, &amp; prudence may raise y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> reputac'on of yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Councell from that greate contempt it lyes under both at home and abroade; &amp; whereby forraigne Pr<hi rend=sup>ees</hi> may be encouraged to assist yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>, &amp; yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Royall party in Engl: to appeare more vigorously for you. 
<p>If for want of such a setled &amp; ho<hi rend=sup>le</hi> Privy Councell, yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> shalbe necessitated (as lately) to call (upon every important occasion) such to Councell who are not sworne, it will not much satisfy yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> party in Engla: nor advantage yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> aff<hi rend=sup>res</hi>. Besides yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Privy Councell wilbe att a great disadvantage, when they are to give their advise upon oath, &amp; are by y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> same obliged to be secreat, &amp; y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> others shalbe att liberty &amp; under noe tye att all. 
<p>My humble advise therefore is, that yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>
forthw<hi rend=sup>th</hi> endeavour by all meanes possible to get a Councell composed of a convenient number of such ho<hi rend=sup>ble</hi>, experienced, &amp; faithfull p&lsquo;sons, as may be equall to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> great importaunce of yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> p<hi rend=sup>e</hi>sent aff<hi rend=sup>res</hi>, &amp; above y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> contempt that yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> now Councell lyes under, aswell in yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> owne Court, as abroade, w<hi rend=sup>th</hi>out w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> it will not be possible for you to goe throughe yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi>
greate businesses. 
<emph>As for my owne particular,<note>De Larrey, a French contemporary writer formerly quoted, says of Sir Edward Nicholas, that he had much better qualities and more zeal for the late Monarch, than the preceding Secretary of State, Windebank. He adds, that he was truly devoted to the Church of England; and having, besides, as much integrity as ability, was as faithful to the son as to the father. &ldquo;Charles II. recompensed his fidelity, and restored him, in <datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>, to the post that his father had given him; if this employment was honourable to him, all the profit redounded to the King, who conferred it on him not till he left France, and when he was a wanderer from Court to Court, and from country to country.&rdquo;</note></emph>

<p>I humbly beseech yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> to give me leave to put you in minde, that att St. Germains y<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>
comaunded me to wayte on you in this place, where you were pleased to tell me you should have occasion to make use of my service as Secre&lsquo;<hi rend=sup>ie</hi>, &amp; to that end <pb id="p.193" n="193"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>.</note>
yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> comaunded me to gett prepared a signet, and other provisions fitting, w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> accordingly I p&lsquo;vided att my owne cost. I was there further tould from yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>, that when I came to Jersey, I should be sworne Sec'rie. And since I came hither, yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>
tould me I should be sworne, as soon as I came into Irla: Now since yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> goes not for Irla: I humbly desire that I may be sworne before yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> dep&lsquo;ture from hence: 
<p><num value="1">1</num>. Because, I know y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> busines belonging to a Sec'rie of State ought not to be p&lsquo;formed by <num value="1">one</num> that is not sworne in y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> place. 
<p><num value="2">2</num>. For that y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> busines I shall doe (not being sworne), will not have that creddit &amp; esteeme, as is requisitt for y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> advantage of affaires of that nature. 
<p><num value="3">3</num>. That it wilbe a great disrepute for me (who have had the honor to serve yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Royale father <num value="7">7</num> yeares in that office) to execute any considerable p&lsquo;te thereof, &amp; not be established in it by oath, w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> only can make a man capable of p&lsquo;formaunce of the duty of that place, as it ought to be. 
<p>Yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> obiection, that if you sweare me, you must doe y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> like for Mr. Long,<note>Mr. Long appears to have been engaged as secretary to Charles in a quasi-private capacity, for his name is not entered upon any of the official lists. The King, influenced most probably by his mother, showed much favour to him. It is perhaps not irrelevant also to observe, that if the handwriting of the rival Secretaries had been allowed any weight in the discussion of the question, Mr. Long must have proved successful against Sir Edward; his mode of writing being singularly precise and clear, whilst that of Nicholas is often scarcely intelligible.</note> is rather a discouragement then a satisfac'con to me, who did hope my soe long faithfull service to yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Royall father would have mov'd yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> to make more difference betweene us, since I have hitherto (I thanke God) carryed a cleere reputac'on in all my wayes. 
<p>Wherefore its my most humble suyte, that yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi>
Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi> wilbe pleased either to give order that I may be sworne yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> Sec'rie (whereby I may be enabled to doe you service), or else that I may have leave w<hi rend=sup>th</hi> yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> gracious favour, to retire untill my faithfull &amp; disinterested service may be of more use in yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> affaires.</text>

<p>Mr. Secretarie, I ame verie glade that I shall see my Neece heere so soone, and I thanke you for all your other news. I beleeue Dr. Morley will write those that he heares out of England of Cromwells dessoluing of his Parliament,<note>An allusion to the transactions of the <datestruct VALUE="1654-09-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1654">1654</year></datestruct>, when Cromwell summoned that Parliament which he immediately afterwards dissolved for their opposition to his assumption of the Protectorate. The speech to which the Queen of Bohemia refers was that remarkable <num value="1">one</num> on the <num value="1">first</num> sitting of the House, when a member, after denying the authority which had called them together, boldly exclaimed, &ldquo;that as God had made him instrumental in cutting down tyranny in <num value="1">one</num> man, so now he could not endure to see the nation's liberties shackled by another, who had no right to the government but by the length of his sword.&rdquo;</note> for being so ungratious as not to doe as he would haue them. it was confirmed to me the last night by <num value="1">one</num> of the States Generall, for <num value="3">three</num> of ther Deputies are come from London that were sent about the treatie of the Amb&lsquo;<hi rend=sup>ors</hi> and the other disputes; they confirme all, but it was so late that I coulde not heare of the particullars. the same State tolde me there was a speech of part of the orange and red men in rebellion against his pretious highness. I pray tell your daughter all this, for I had sealed her letter before I had the certaintie of the news. I ame verie glad the king resolues to stay at Aix, it is much better than Collein. I heare there is <num value="1">one</num> that has heeretofore served my Lo: of Brainford<note>Patrick Ruthen, Earl of Forth, in Scotland. He had been General of Charles's forces during the Rebellion; but was dead at the date of this letter.</note> paked from Scotland to the King but <num value="3">three</num> days agone, and came from thence but sixe days before, he would tell no news but made hast away. Soone as he went, there reached heere <num value="1">one</num> Thomson, <num value="1">one</num> I haue seene before: he tells all the particullars of the defeat that is so bragged of. he saith that they were dispersed vpon it, but it is aboue fiue weekes since he came from <pb id="p.212" n="212">

thence, being come thourough England by his countrie, the borders, where in his passage he mett with a partie where he was hurt and lamed, but for all that he is gone to the King. he much complaines of diuisions amongst them, and not of Sir George Monroe, which they doe also. I doe admire how people could tell so great a lye as the pacquet, but it is verie common amongst my countriemen. Phil: Mohun is heere, she is fled from England fearing to be imprisoned by Cromwell, shes verie good companie and talkes verie freelie but handsomlie. My Ladie Herbert is also heere, since Sunday last; I haue had yett no time to aske her anie thing, hauing not seene her since Sunday.

Manning by name), discovered unto the Protector all his designs and counsels; who being found out, was by his Majesty's command sent to a strong castle adjacent to Colen, there to be kept close prisoner. But all the Court being highly incensed against him for his perfidiousnesse, <num value="1">one</num> of his Majesty's servants (though contrary to order) pistoled him as he was lighting out of the coach at the Castle gate, giving him less than the due reward of his so abominable treachery.&rdquo; It was by Manning that Penruddock had been betrayed. He corresponded with Thurloe.</note> I wish all those of his cabal with him. I wish I might know whome he has accused on this side the sea, to auoide them, but this is onelie in case you may tell it, for I doe not desire it otherwise; I haue curiositie enough to desire to know the rest, but I will not desire but as you think fitt.

 <pb id="p.231" n="231"> 
<div2 type=section id="c.4.37"><head>Letters of Sir Edward Hyde (Afterwards Earl of Clarendon), and Sir Richard Browne.</head>

<p>The letters now to be given, also from the papers of Sir Richard Browne, will be found to throw additional and valuable light on the condition of the various members of the royal family and their adherents during the interval between the death of Charles the <num value="1">First</num> and the Restoration. Only the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> letters of the series are of earlier date. These were written (in <datestruct value="1646--"><year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct>) from Jersey, whither Hyde had accompanied the Prince of Wales, afterwards Charles the <num value="2">Second</num>; having been named of his Council in the preceding year. His object at this time was to counteract the intrigues of the Queen to get possession of the Prince; and the desponding tone in which these letters are written marks the failure of that design. The <num value="1">first</num> is dated but a few days after the Prince had left Jersey to join his mother in Paris. Jersey was now under the government of Lord Jermyn, the Queen's favourite; but his deputy, Sir George Carteret, was Hyde's intimate friend; and with him he remained, solaced also by the friendly intercourse of Lords Hopton and Capel, and engaged in the composition of his <hi rend=italics>History of the Rebellion</hi>, which he had begun at Scilly not many weeks before. He did not quit this retreat till <datestruct value="1648"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct>. During the same period Sir Edward Nicholas was at Caen in Normandy, and afterwards in Holland, where, on being obliged to fly from England, he had the King's permission to reside. Lord Digby also, to whom frequent reference is made, had been in Ireland at the time of the Prince's flight to Jersey, but joined him soon after with <num value="2">two</num> frigates and <num value="200">two hundred</num> soldiers, strenuously to advise an attempt upon Ireland, in which the Prince refused to engage. On quitting Jersey, in <datestruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct>, Hyde joined Charles in Holland (his <hi rend=italics>Life</hi> gives an interesting notice of his adventures on that occasion), and soon after the King's death he was sent Ambassador to Spain, from which country he rejoined Charles in France, and was appointed Resident at Antwerp, where he remained during the unsuccessful Scotch campaign, and till he and his master again met after the escape from the field of Worcester. In the latter passage <pb id="p.232" n="232"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1646--"><year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct>.</note>
of the Correspondence, to which these events bring us, so many allusions occur to the royal fleet that it may be desirable to describe its position at the time. When Charles I. perished on the scaffold, a portion of the navy revolted from the Parliament, and sailed to Holland in aid of the Royal exiles. These ships were put under the command of Prince Rupert, and were employed by him in a predatory warfare against the Commonwealth, besides making several attempts on the Eastern coast of England in aid of the small Royal party still existing there; after which they proceeded to the Irish coast, where they took some valuable prizes. The Parliament sent Blake after them; but in <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>, Rupert, having forced his way through Blake's fleet, continued to capture English ships, apparently on his own account, and indeed without either asking for, or receiving, any orders from the young exiled King. He then proceeded for Portugal, but was forced off by Blake, so that he was obliged to fly for the Mediterranean, where he commenced aggressions on the Spaniards, and having afterwards repaired and refitted at Toulon, from whence he found it necessary to retire, sailed, in <datestruct value="1650--"><year reg="1650">1650</year></datestruct>, for the West Indies. At this period Scilly and Jersey sent out swarms of privateers; but those islands being captured by the Parliamentary forces, the freebooters were obliged to bring their prizes into the ports of Britanny; and, in return for the sanction of Royal Commissions, were called upon to pay certain droits into the King's Exchequer. To that arrangement many of the following Letters refer. In <datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>, Rupert arrived at Nantes on his return from the West Indies, after suffering heavy losses from storms; so that, in fact, he only brought back <num value="1">one</num> man of war, and <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> other vessels, being the sole remains of <num value="25">twenty five</num> ships of force of which his squadron originally consisted: and these he was compelled to sell to pay his seamen, under circumstances which will be found illustrated in the ensuing Correspondence. Finally, it may be convenient to bring to the reader's recollection that the young King staid at Paris until <datestruct value="1654--"><year reg="1654">1654</year></datestruct>, when he proceeded through Flanders to Spa; thence to Aix-la-Chapelle, and ultimately to Cologne; and that in <datestruct VALUE="1658-01--"><month reg="01">January</month> <year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>, he was at Bruges, where he appointed Sir Edward Hyde, his Chancellor of the Exchequer up to that period, to be Lord Chancellor of England. It is of course needless to add that the men among whom these highsounding titles were thus exchanged continued still to be as powerless as they were poor; they found themselves destitute even of the ordinary comforts of existence; yet, as the letters now printed show, this little exiled Court had its intrigues, jealousies, fears, and hopes, in quite as great an abundance as when, after the lapse of a few years, it was &ldquo;restored&rdquo; to Whitehall and St. James's. <pb id="p.233" n="233">

sent from the Duke of Orleans, which it seemes they thinke fitt to conceale, when they do not intende to satisfy. 
<p>I am very sorry for the good Deanes<note>This was Dr. Stewart, Dean of the Chapel Royal, whom Clarendon, in another place, calls &ldquo;a very honest and learned gentleman, and most conversant in the learning which vindicated the dignity and authority of the Church.&rdquo; He had been long about Charles's person; for, as early as <datestruct value="1646"><year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct>, in a letter preserved in the Clarendon <hi rend=italics>State Papers</hi>, vol. ii. p. <num value="253">253</num>, and addressed to the Prince, the King calls him an honest trusty servant, and recommends him to his Royal Highness as Dean of his Chapel, telling him at the same time to take the Doctor's advice, &ldquo;giving reverence to his opinion in all things concerning conscience and church affairs.&rdquo;</note> indisposicon, though I am gladd it is nothinge but a ffitt of <pb id="p.244" n="244">

<p>The wante of the title of the Duke of Bauaria keepes us from making a congratulatory dispatch to him, which is requisite in seuerall respectes, therfore I pray hasten it as soone as you may: let me heare any particulars you receaue from Englande, especially how our frends at Detforde doe.<note>This inquiry refers to the Evelyn family at Says Court.</note> If it would be any comforte to you to haue companyons in misery, you will heare shortly that wee are in greate distresses,<note>The periodical prints of that day thus account for the King not wishing to remain at Paris. &ldquo;The Scots King is still in Paris, but now upon his remove. What shall he do then? Trayl a pike under the young Lady of Orleans:&rdquo; (this lady had recently raised a regiment for the French King's service against the Confederate Lords:) &ldquo;an honour too large for the late Majesty of Scotland. His confidents have satt in Council, and it is allowed by his Mother, that during these tumults in France, it is neither honourable nor expedient for him to continue in Paris, the affections of the citizens for the most part being alienated from the King,&rdquo; &amp;c</note> for I cannot imagyne which way the Kinge will be able to procure mony for his subsistance; nor indeed how the ffrench Courte will subsiste it selfe. Wee know nothinge heare of the Spanish army: what is become of it?

<p>S<hi rend=sup>r</hi>, 
<p>That yours of the <num value="10">10</num>. of December (which came to my handes the same day that I dispatched my last to you) hath yett brought you no answer, is not my faulte, for as I was takinge penn &amp; paper to do it on Sunday last, your other of the <num value="14">14</num>. arryued, which derected me to change my cource of writinge, and to send no more to Nantz,<note>Sir Richard Browne was at this moment very actively endeavouring to collect the King's dues on the prizes brought into the different ports of France.</note> but to St. Malos: and indeede I was very gladd to finde that you were bounde for Brest, wher I should haue wished you, notwithstanding any discouragements you receaued from thence, except you could bringe a recommendation from this Courte: for Mr. Holder<note>Holder was Secretary to Prince Rupert. He was loyal, and it appears from the Clarendon <hi rend=italics>State Papers</hi> that great dependence was placed on him when wanted; yet Sir Edward calls him &ldquo;the pert, importunate agent of the Catholics.&rdquo; See

very little. I am confident the letter you haue from our Master, will pr&aelig;serue you from any affronts, and then sure your beinge ther will be at least for your owne aduantage, both to collecte what is dew to his Ma<hi rend=sup>ty</hi> upon accounts,<note>The difficulty which Charles experienced in raising any money upon the prizes, is alluded to in <hi rend=italics>Perfect Passages</hi> of the <datestruct VALUE="1652-10-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>: &ldquo;Prince Rupert hath lately seized on some good prizes; he keeps himself far remote, and makes his kinsman, Charles Stuart, make a leg for some cullings of his windfalls.&rdquo;</note> which must be worth somewhat, and will be easily discouer'd by what Mr. Holder hath receaued from the Duke, and to receaue the dewes upon ther last pryzes, which will, they say, amounte to a rounde summ.&mdash;Though S<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Geo. Carterett was gone out of the towne, when I receaued yours of the <num value="10">10</num>. yett very contrary to my expectation he returned hither <num value="3">3</num> or <num value="4">4</num> dayes after, and stayed only <num value="1">one</num> night, when I shewed him your letter; sure he will do all the good offices to you in all thinges he is able. My L<hi rend=sup>d</hi> . . . . . will obserue the caution you giue him, and will be gladd you can discouer any monyes to be dew to him, and he will gladly giue you authority to receaue it; indeed a supply will come as seasonable to him as to any body, for when I haue told you, that none of us haue receaued a penny since you went, you will belieue our necessityes to be importunate enough, which would be more insupportable, if wee did not see the King himselfe reduced to greater distresse then you can believe or imagyne. I perceaue the arrest of ffarrande, is upon some pique betweene the Duke of Vandosme and the Marshall Melleray,<note>Melleray was Governor of Nantes.</note> betweene whom the contests grew very high, and are like to breake out to such a degree that the Courte is not without apprehension, that it shall not conteyne them both to its seruice, and seemes at present, to be vnsatisfyed with the Marshall, and I heare some letters of reprehension are sent to him; therefore this arrest is not like to produce any aduantage to his Ma<hi rend=sup>ty</hi>, besides that it seemes the shipp is out of the power of the Marshall. I haue giuen Choquex the <pb id="p.257" n="257"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>.</note>
papers, and will conferr with him what is to be done, for it is I perceaue true that the shipp and all the furniture was really putt into his handes by Pr. Ruperte,<note>Prince Rupert, just before this date, was in the West Indies, and had with him a fleet of <num value="15">fifteen</num> sail, to which <num value="8">eight</num> Dutch ships were joined in October. He is stated in the journals to have captured <num value="10">ten</num> rich English vessels, whilst cruising off St. Kitts. It is a remarkable circumstance, however, that another journal, the <hi rend=italics>Perfect Passayes</hi>, places him off Cyprus, and describes him as capturing all vessels that pass him in the Levant.</note> so that besides the restitution of the vessell, there will be a large accounte to be made: When any thinge is resolued, you shall haue an accounte of it. 
<p>I am very gladd you haue had so good successe in your suite, I hope it is but an instance of future good fortune at Brest, wher ther is much dew, if you haue receaued so little, as I haue formerly hearde you haue mentioned:&mdash;I pr&aelig;sume you haue kept an exacte accounte of all you haue had upon those assignations, which I putt you only in minde of, because upon conference with S<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Geo. Carterett, he could not belieue it had bene possible, that upon so many pryzes as he obserued to be brought in, you should touch so little, as I assured him had come to your handes. When you went from hence, and vpon occasyon of somewhat I writt lately in a letter to Mr. . . . . . of the no profitt accrewed to his Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>
upon that receipte, he answered me that it was impossible much could come to his Ma<hi rend=sup>tys</hi> owne receipte, when he granted so large assignments out of it, and so mentioned in the <num value="1">first</num> place, what was allotted to you, as if it had bene payde.&mdash;Wee know nothinge of Englande more than that your ffrench Minister was landed at Dover. Wee shall shortly see what his reception hath bene, and shall then better guess at the effects: in the meane tyme, we are at no ease heare. My Lo: of Rochester (for that is my L<hi rend=sup>d</hi> Willmotts title)<note>There was considerable difficulty in finding a proper title for Lord Wilmot, his <num value="1">first</num> proposed <num value="1">one</num> of Esssx being claimed by Lord Capel, and that of Danby by the Attorney- Geheral; upon which, as stated in the Clarendon <hi rend=italics>State Papers</hi>, iii. <num value="121">121</num>, &ldquo;my Lord declined that title, and so his patent is drawn up for the Earl of Rochester.&rdquo;&mdash;See also iii. <num value="57">57</num>.</note> is to sett out from hence <pb id="p.258" n="258">

on Thursday morninge, he trauells with a small trayne, and hath it in his power to assume the title of Ambassadour,<note>It was hoped that he might succeed in inducing the German Princes to advance money for the King's private expenditure; and also might so manage with the Dutch as to render them disposed to undertake some decided step in his favour. The King must at this time have been in sore distress. A letter from Paris in the <hi rend=italics>Several Proceedings</hi>, of <datestruct VALUE="-12-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, asserts that &ldquo;the titular King of Scots is reduced to so low a condition that he is forced to eate his meals in taverns here at Paris, having not the commodity of dining at home.&rdquo; And not <num value="3">three</num> months before this date, even Hyde had thus expressed himself in a letter to Sir Edward Nicholas: &ldquo;It is no wonder you should desire to be eased, as much as may be, of all kinds of charges. I am sure I have as much reason as any man living to join with you in thrift; yet I cannot avoid the constant expense of <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> livres the week for postage of letters, which I borrow scandalously out of my friends pockets, or else my letters must more scandalously remain still at the post-house; and I am sure all those which concern my own private affairs would be received for <num value="10">ten</num> sous a week, so that all the rest are for the King, from whom I have not received <num value="1">one</num> penny since I came hither, and am put to all this charge; and yet it is to no purpose to complain, though I have not been master of a crown these many months, and cold for want of clothes and fire, and owe for all the meate which I have eaten these <num value="3">three</num> months, and to a poor woman who is not longer able to trust.&rdquo;</note> which I suppose he will choose to declyne, and do his businesse in a priuate way, which will procure a speedyer dispatch.&mdash;God pr&aelig;serue you.

haue had to carry you out: The Spanyard<note>A part of the private history of the time, to which no certain clue remains. Some plans had been put in agitation on the part of the Condeans to persuade both England and Spain to aid them with their arms; and as at this period there were <num value="2">two</num> powerful political parties at Madrid, the man alluded to may have been a secret agent in the politics of the day.</note> desyred me to giue you my thankes for your care of him, which I do very heartily, and conceaue by this tyme he is gotten into his owne Country, and I do not thinke he will euer visitt ffrance agayne, which he hath no reason to loue, but for the English which he founde heare. Ther hath beene yett no letter from the Mareschall de Melleray, which ther was no reason to exspecte, if you had not mentioned it, as somewhat you thought intended; I am exceedinge gladd that he proceeded so roundly with the English Rebells, as to arrest both the shipps and goods,<note>An event not elsewhere recorded; unless it refers to the seizures of some ships at Dunkirk, afterwards restored to Cromwell by the French Government.</note> I wish they did so in all other partes of ffrance, that they might proceede a little more briskely towards ther greate worke, then yett they appeare to doe, but if I am not deceaued, the English will quicken them shortly, if they haue any spiritts left.

Marechall de Melleray,<note>Melleray was at this moment a great object of jealousy to Cardinal Mazarin, who caused a letter to be sent to him from the King, inviting him to Court, and adding an offer of the command in Champagne; but the Marshal, knowing well that this was an intrigue to get him and his son, both of them suspected as friendly to the Cond&eacute; party, into the power of the Court faction, excused himself on pretence of illness, &amp;c.

She left her son the fugitive at the Louvre, given up to the bent of his Common Prayer Mongers, and of Jermyn, whose power is now greater with him than any; which is a sure sign that his Mother rules him again, and that he hath resigned his judgment, affection, and all to her; because heretofore there was a sore grudge between him and Jermyn, in regard at his former being here. Jermyn (who then commanded and still keeps the purse) was very streight handed over him in his expenses.&mdash;&mdash;The old Court flies begin now again to flock about him&rdquo; (<datestruct VALUE="1651-12-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> <month reg="12">Dec.</month> <year reg="1651">1651</year></datestruct>) &ldquo;from all parts.

Some of them are come to the Louvre already out of Flanders, as Hyde, a man of dignity too, that calls himself the Chequer Chancellor; here is also Bramhall, of London Derry, Dan O&lsquo;Neill, Fraiser, a physitian, and <num value="1">one</num> Lloid, a Chaplain.

But to pacify them they were told his intent was but to go to Rosney upon the way to Roan. His mother marches with him. The small baggage they have is already gone. They give out that they will returne after the peace is made, and condemn this City of ingratitude; alledging that it had bin blockt up by the King before this time, had it not bin for their mediation with his Majesty.&rdquo;</note>

<p>S<hi rend=sup>r</hi>, 
<p>I am sure it can be no newes to you that Pr. Rupert is safe at Nantes,<note>This was the last of Prince Rupert's maritime expeditions during the Interregnum. On his return to Europe he captured a rich prize laden with tobacco, and having carried her into Nantz, in <datestruct VALUE="1653-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>, he was soon after seized with a violent illness, recovering from which he proceeded to Paris, and was well received by the French King. From Paris he went to the Imperial Court; but returned to England at the Restoration. The small fleet now under the command of Prince Rupert had been originally refitted at Toulon; but having met with losses of ships, particularly at the Azores (where his own flag-ship, the Reformation, had been sunk, and the whole crew of <num value="360">360</num> men perished, with the exception of Rupert, his brother Maurice, and <num value="12">twelve</num> others), it was found necessary to return to the northern parts of France; particularly as Admiral Penn, with his squadron, was waiting for them in the Straits of Gibraltar.</note> and therfore it is very probable this letter may not finde you at Brest, but that you may haue thought it fitt to attende his Highnesse, and offer him your seruice. The Kinge hath sent Mr. Holdersome derection concerninge the Hamborough shipp. If George Carterett<note>Sir George Carteret, a little before this time, commanded a small squadron of the Royal ships, with which he cruised, principally upon the coast of Ireland, and greatly to the annoyance of the Republican party, if we may judge from their journals.</note> be not with you, I pray send this letter to him by the <num value="1">first</num> safe opportunity, and if he hath not a coppy of your cypher, send it to him, I havinge used it in this letter for <num value="3">3</num> or <num value="4">4</num> lynes, which it is necessary for him to understande. Excuse me, who hauinge no letter of yours to answer, for beinge at present so shorte, which you know is not my naturall faulte.

<p>About <num value="3">three</num> days since I receaued yours of the <num value="24">24</num>. of the last moneth, which makes me still wonder how it comes to passe, that yours are so longe upon the way, for it is not possible that the post can be <num value="12">12</num> or <num value="14">14</num> dayes upon the way from Brest, and so much tyme ther is still betweene your writinge and my readinge. I suppose the Governour is now gone to Nantes, or else he will not wayte on the Prince, which I should be sorry for. the Kinge sent his coach on Wensday to Orleans, supposinge it will meete his Highnesse<note>Prince Rupert. This event is much noticed in the London journals of the time. Those journals also assert, upon the authority of some runaway seamen who had landed at Weymouth, &ldquo;that all the plunder he hath brought is not worth <num value="10000">10,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, and the Swallow is hallen up altogether unserviceable.&rdquo;</note>
ther, or that he will be ther within a day or <num value="2">2</num> after, so that wee exspecte him heare on Tuesday or Wensday, and till his returne I do not conceaue that you neede putt your selfe to the troble of a iourny, and if ther be then any occasy on for it, I will aduertise you: If the euidence against the Captaynes be so pregnant as it seemes by you to be, of seueral theftes and cozinages, how would it be possible for the Judge to declare them innocent? and though it may, it would be difficulte to obteyne iustice against them in that jurisdiction, yett the declininge to giue in the testimony and charge against them before the proper officer (though it is possible he will not haue power enough to cause reparacon to be made, if he had the will to do it) will be made a greate countenance to them, as if the allegations were not waighty; and I finde (though I am a stranger to all that is done on that syde of the house) that the Captaynes are upon all occasyons much magnifyed, as excellent vsefull ministers.&mdash;I am very gladd of that order you <pb id="p.269" n="269">

Hath G<hi rend=sup>e</hi> Carterett a good opinion of Anthonio? I hope ther will be some parte of your house-rent payd out of hande, but I know not what to say to your assignements upon the Prince, who no doubt will haue occasyon to vse all and more than he can haue brought home, to repayre and fitt out his shipps.<note>These were the shattered ships which had returned to Nantz from the West Indian cruise: but another portion of the Royal squadron was now favourably received in the ports of Holland; as we find asserted in the <hi rend=italics>Moderate Publisher</hi> of the <datestruct VALUE="1653-04-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>.

Wee do flatter ourselves with an opinion that our affayres will mende, and that wee shall not stay long heare, indeede I belieue our Master will putt himselfe into some action this summer, and that wee shall not spende it in ffrance.<note>This was a vain hope, for Charles remained in France until the ensuing year.</note> God pr&aelig;serue you and,

I haue not yet theard <num value="1">one</num> word from the Gouernour since his goinge hence: butt Mr. Holder (who yesterday returned from Nantes) assures mee that hee had beene with the Prince some dayes before his Highnesses going for Paris; and that His H. did also acknowledge to him to haue receiued my I're by Sir G: Carterett.<note>How very little chance the Privy Purse had of assistance from the assets of the squadron, may be judged from a letter of Hyde's to Nicholas, where he says: &ldquo;You must never expect information from me of any of the business of the prize, or anything that is managed by Prince Rupert, who consults only with the Lord Keeper; and I much doubt very little of that money will come to the King.

Charles Stuart is at a non plus what to do; things do not answer his expectations: his designes faile him.&rdquo; Another observes: &ldquo;Prince Rupert flourishes with his blackmoors and new liveries, and so doth his cousin Charles, they having shared the moneys made of the prize goods at Nantz; and in recompence Rupert is made Master of the Horse.&rdquo;</note>

Indeed all the affairs connected with these prizes were very badly managed, as Sir Edward Hyde observes in another place, by Sir Edward Herbert, whom he describes as despising all men, and looked upon by Prince Rupert as an oracle. See the Clarendon <hi rend=italics>State Papers</hi>, vol. iii. p. <num value="177">177</num>.

<p>Yours of the <num value="31">31</num>. of the last (which is the last I haue receaued from you) gaue me so much ioy, that as soon as I receaued it, I thought it my duty to imparte the good newes to the Kinge, who upon reading that clause, made not the least scruple that Mr. Morrice<note><p>From this mention of Mr. Morrice's escape, it would seem as if some report now prevailed that a Royalist of that name, who was supposed to have been (and in fact was) put to death in <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>, had made his escape, and remained in Ireland. This Morrice had in the latter year got possession of Pomfret Castle, and held it some time for the King, till it was besieged and taken by Lambert. Morrice, who was excepted from the terms of surrender, managed to make his escape at the time; but he was afterwards seized and executed at Lancaster, as Whitelock tells us. His story, as given by Lord Clarendon, is a curious episode of the civil war, and sufficiently brief to be worth repeating here: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>A young man, in the beginning of the war, had been an officer in the King's army, but engaged in the Parliament army with some circumstances not very commendable. By his courage and pleasant humour he made himself very acceptable, and obtained a commission as Colonel; but being a free speaker, and living licentiously, he was left out in new modelling the army, but not without compliments. He had a competent estate in Yorkshire, to which he went, and resided there. As he grew older, he repented of having left the King's service, and meant to take an opportunity of returning to it. His humour was so cheerful and pleasant, and he mixed so much with men of all parties, that he had great weight with all of them. The Governor of Pomfret Castle was his most intimate and particular friend, and was so fond of him that he was never easy without him; he was continually at the Castle, and the same bed served him. He now concerted with the King's party to surprize the Castle, and he so artfully managed with the Governor, telling him that there was such a design, that he mixed with those concerned, in order to communicate everything to the Governor, that he completely lulled that gentleman to sleep, and made him inattentive to notices which he received from other quarters. He also ingratiated himself with many of the soldiers, and at length effected his purpose. Cromwell was then gone for Scotland, so that they had time to repair the fortifications, and collect a good garrison. Cromwell ordered Rainsborough to go with a few troops to keep them in check; and whilst he lay at Doncaster, <num value="10">10</num> miles from Pomfret, they sent <num value="20">20</num> picked men, who by the most dexterous management actually surprized Rainsborough in his bed, and mounted him on a horse; but when he found how few there were who had surprized him, he called to his soldiers, and then the captors, finding they could not carry him off, actually killed him, and then all made their way back to the Castle. 
<p>At length Lambert was sent to besiege the Castle; the garrison made a most gallant defence, but finding no hopes of relief, they at length offered to surrender, if they might have honourable conditions. Lambert said, they were gallant men, and he would do all he could to preserve them; but Col. Morrice and <num value="5">five</num> more of those who had destroyed Rainsborough, must be given up, and he could not save their lives. The garrison said they never would deliver up any of their compamons, and desired <num value="6">six</num> days, that these <num value="6">six</num> might deliver themselves as well as they could, the rest being at liberty to assist them. Lambert generously consented. The garrison made several sallies to effect the desired escape in <num value="1">one</num> of which Morrice and another escaped; in another sally <num value="2">two</num> more got away; and when the <num value="6">six</num> days were expired and the other <num value="2">two</num> remained in the castle, their friends concealed them so effectually, with a stock of provisions for a month, that rendering the castle, and assuring Lambert that the <num value="6">six</num> were all gone, and he was unable to find them after the most diligent search, and had dismantled the castle, they at length got off also.</QUOTE>

I heare nothinge of Choquez, and what his undertakinge is I know not. I asked the Kinge whether he knew anything of the businesse, and I haue reason to believe that he nether hath nor will giue any order in that affaire without askinge me how the case standes; but if you give me no cause to move publiquely in it, it is no wonder if I say nothinge of it, and if you do write upon the argument, you will write so that the letter may be reade at Councell, any other advertisements you will put in a paper aparte. I heare nothinge of the wyne, nor know not any thinge of Nantes, when they come away, who are ther, or what they do ther. 
<p>The Kinge hath spent the last fortnight in the country at Chantilly, and returned hither on Wensday last: and proposes to goe backe thither agayne tomorrow, and I suppose will spende his tyme ther, till the fayre weather be done: I can tell you little of newes, the distractions I thinke are so high in Englande, that ther must be some suddayne alteration: and I depende more on that, then any thinge that can happen abroade, wher ther is little care of <pb id="p.287" n="287">

honour, or any thinge but therowne present conveniences. It may be, all the pause in your businesse is in contemplation of the greate pryze, and I would not interrupt that, by any meddlinge in a matter so particular and inferior as the other; but if that were at an end, or I knew what were like to come of it, I would be very importunate to knowe what the grounde of the proceedinge is. If ther be no reason to the contrary, I shall be gladd to heare from you, and as particularly as you please; but if you thinke it in any consideration inconvenient, I referr it wholly to you, and am very heartily,

Octob<hi rend=sup>r</hi> I can now give your Hon<hi rend=sup>r</hi> this brief account of my businesse here on which I haue soe longe and with much charge and trouble attended.

By H. H. Prince Rupert's order I haue now commenced a sute in law for recoverie of the fifteenths, and the Duke of Yorkes interest (both which the Mar<hi rend=sup>l</hi> allways intended to restore without diminution) and his highnesse doth soe nobly support and countenance me therin, that I hope eyther by decree of justice, or by the Captains volontary rendition, to have a speedy end, &amp; therby be soon able to remit to Paris that money his Ma<hi rend=sup>ty</hi>

<p>I haue (together with money for the charges of the carriage) committed to Mr. Killigrews care, a butt of Canary wine divided into <num value="3">three</num> barrells.

It will be observed in the next letter, that suspicions of Killigrew, by no means surprising, appear to have occurred to Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer.</note>

Mr. Long, the Ex-Secretary, was therefore brought forward to concoct this story of the conference with Cromwell on the evidence of <num value="1">one</num> Massonet, or rather on his <num value="2">second</num>-hand hearsay evidence from a maidservant in London, who assured him that she had seen Sir Edward go into Cromwell's chamber at Whitehall. Charles of course had the sense to laugh at it, being himself in fact a competent witness to prove an alibi. See Clarendon's <hi rend=italics>History</hi>, vol. iii. p. <num value="402">402</num>. When Charles the <num value="1">First</num> appointed a Council for the Prince of Wales in <datestruct value="1644--"><year reg="1644">1644</year></datestruct>, Mr. Long was their Secretary; but after this was suspected of holding a correspondence with the Earl of Essex, on which he went into France, and made great complaint to the Queen-mother, who always strongly supported his interests. After the death of Charles the <num value="1">First</num> he became Secretary to the young King in his exile, was created a Baronet shortly after the Restoration, was Auditor of the Exchequer, and a Privy Councillor. Suspicion attached to him of having been secretly a Roman Catholic, and this is partly borne out by a legacy in his will.

Ratcliffe<note>Ratcliffe, instead of Lord Byron, had once been thought of by Charles the <num value="1">First</num> as Governor to the Duke of York in his infancy. He was a Privy Counsellor, and lived at Oxford during the siege, before which the Queen had desired him either to bring the Duke to her at Paris, or carry him to Ireland; but this Ratcliffe refused, on the plea that he dared not to convey any of the King's sons out of the kingdom without an express order from the King. In the &ldquo;Life of James the <num value="2">Second</num>,&rdquo; evidently written with authority from that Prince, speaking of this affair it is remarked, &ldquo;which nicety, or I may rather call it indiscretion of his, might have cost his Highness dear, as being the occasion of his being put into the Rebells' hands.&rdquo; When the Duke of York was taken prisoner at Oxford by the Parliamentary army, Fairfax ordered Ratcliffe to continue with him, until the pleasure of the Parliament should be known; and he was only discharged from his attendance on the Earl of Northumberland being appointed Parliamentary Governor to the Duke. In consequence of his early acquantance, Ratcliffe retained much influence over James, to the great dislike of the Queen, and also in opposition to Lord Byron. He was at Jersey with Charles, and afterwards joined him in Flanders. He was also very active in caring for the Duke's interests, when it was reported that the King was dead in Scotland, <num value="3">three</num> years before this period.

<p>The French Court parted hence a weeke since, and remaines yett at Compeigne. Yesterday came newes that the Marl<hi rend=sup>l</hi>: de Turene had defeated <num value="4">4</num> Regiments of horse, and taken a small place: yf true, a good beginninge of this Campaigne. 
<p>M<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Locker, M<hi rend=sup>r</hi> Crumwells Envoye, followes the Court: before his going hence he declared to a person of quality, that he had by him, and would ere long produce, a Commission to be Ambassador; nottwithstandinge that I haue publiquely (since my returne hither) appeared in the French Court in presence both of this K. &amp; Queene, and twice beene with the Count of Brienne, yett I find nothinge at all of any the least intimation to retire:<note>The temporising policy of the French Court, still unwilling openly to concede all that Cromwell demanded, yet fearful to offend the Protector by abrupt dismissal of his Envoy, appears in these allusions.</note> And the other day in conference with my Lord Jermyn, his opinion was that this State would permitt me to remaine here as long as his Ma<hi rend=sup>ty</hi> thought good: soe that I expect to heare what his Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> pleasure will bee, in this particular: forbeareinge in the meane time to engage for the continuance of my house, or to make a new family: humbly intreating your Hon<hi rend=sup>r</hi>, that yf his Ma<hi rend=sup>ty</hi> thinke fitt to continue mee here, you will please to move for a settlement of my subsistence uppon some good and well assured funds, without which I shall soone lapse into a very sad condition. 
<p>In the conuersation I have had abroad in my trauail, as well as here in Paris since my returne had with the French Protestants, I find them generally much inuolved in Crumwells interests, he hauinge <pb id="p.314" n="314"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1656--"><year reg="1656">1656</year></datestruct>.</note>
dexterously insinuated into their belief that he will maintaine them in the enjoyment of ther preuiledges: a more manifest demonstration of their good inclinations to him may also doubtlesse bee, their hauinge since Lockers arriuall effaced the name of <hi rend=italics>Kinge</hi> out of the inscription of the Seate for the Inglish Ambassad<hi rend=sup>rs</hi> at Charanton, and left only &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>pour les Ambassad<hi rend=sup>rs</hi> de la Grand Bretaigne.</hi>&rdquo; 
<quote rend=blockquote lang=la><L>Olim tempus erit magno cum optaverit emptum

<p>We exspecte the Duke of Yorke here very speedily, and then wee shall come the sooner to a resolution in that pointe which concernes you. I pray lett us know more of Don, Michel de Castile, and of Mr. Locker: I would be gladd you would send me (if you have it by you) the life of the Connestable De Desguynes, which they say is well written.

<head>A Selection from the Correspondence of Sir Richard Browne, Ambassador at Paris.</head>
 <pb id="p.327" n="327"> 
<div2 type=section id="c.5.38">

<head>Selection from the Correspondence of< Sir Richard Browne.</head>

<p>The subjoined extracts are taken exclusively from the letters and papers of Sir Richard Browne, Evelyn's father-in-law, of whom such frequent mention is made in the Diary and Correspondence now brought to a close. They will be found to refer chiefly to matters strictly historical, having been selected for the occasional new facts they contribute to that series of remarkable events which form the subjects of the various correspondences contained in this volume. They require little illustration, beyond what has incidentally been supplied in notes already given. The <num value="1">first</num> paper contains instructions for Browne's special embassy to Holland; but, with this exception, all the extracts given relate to his official residence in Paris, in the interval between <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1651--"><year reg="1651">1651</year></datestruct>. What followed the latter year has been the subject of the correspondence just given between himself and Clarendon. If the reader refers to the <hi rend=italics>Diary</hi>, vol. i., p. <num value="288">288</num>, he will oberve that it was shortly after the date when the last of these letters was written, the result of the fight of Worcester having put a decided close to all further Royalist effort for the time, that Sir Richard Browne sent his son-in-law Evelyn over to &ldquo;compound with the soldiers,&rdquo; and take possession of Sir Richard's seat at Sayes Court, Deptford, with a view to permanent residence, &ldquo;there being now so little appearance of any change for the better, all being entirely in the rebels' hands.&rdquo; Shortly after Evelyn had so left Paris, at which his young wife was to remain, with her father, till Sayes Court should be prepared for her reception, Sir Richard Browne had to communicate a piece of news of much domestic interest to his son-in-law, and his notes on the occasion may be given here not inappropriately, whether as specimens of Sir Richard's more intimate and friendly manner of writing, or as connected very closely with the family story of the Evelyns. The <num value="1">first</num> is dated from Paris, on the <datestruct VALUE="1652-05-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>. &ldquo;Dear Son,&mdash;Dick Hoare hath formerly given you notice of the safety of your lost half, or half lost Ben: Johnson, and will also tell you by what good fortune I have (paying the half-pistole) got possession of your letter post. I am now to acquaint you, that your wife <pb id="p.328" n="328"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1640--"><year reg="1640">1640</year></datestruct>.</note>
will (God blessing her with safety) bring you a depositum you left behind you here, of far greater value, viz. a <hi rend=italics>Hans in Kelde</hi>, a young cavalier, who hath within these few days unexpectedly discovered his vivacity, and plainly manifests his intention within few months to come forth, and be a citizen of this world. This (though yet a secret here) is so real a certainty, that I exceedingly joy to give you this <num value="1">first</num> notice thereof. And if grandfathers love more tenderly their remote offspring, you will not I hope envy me my share in the great contentment, who so passionately wish you and yours all happiness, under God's eternal, and the temporary blessing of your ever dearly loving father, to serve you, RD BROWNE.&rdquo; &mdash;The <num value="2">second</num> is dated <num value="3">three</num> days later, and addressed &ldquo;My son Evelyne.&rdquo; Thus it runs: &ldquo;Dear Son,&mdash;Lest what I sent you by the last post should by accident have gone astray, I now repeat what much concerns you to know, that you may, as soon as may be, participate our joy, the nature whereof is to be diffusive. Your wife, by being since your departure so free from nausea's and other ordinary indications of childbearing, hath so deceived us that, until very lately, we scarce other ways than in wishes thought of so great a blessing; of the certainty whereof there is now no doubt to be made, though as yet it be here so much a secret, that none but my wife and I and your maid do know it. God accomplish prosperously this his mercy, to his glory, your comfort, and the singular contentment of your dearly loving father to serve you, RICHARD BROWNE.&rdquo;

The Elector Palatine, Charles Louis, the writer of the letter in the text, returned soon after its date into England, where he had long been a pensioner. His brothers were constant to the Royal cause; but he took part with the Parliament, and sat in the Assembly of Divines.

In order to w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> the ffrench ffleet hath set saile for L&lsquo;Abruzzo, there to joyne w<hi rend=sup>th</hi> the Conte de Conuersano, who hath reuiued y<hi rend=sup>t</hi> rebellion and is at the head of a considerable army.

<text><body><p>S<hi rend=sup>r</hi>, 
<p>Yf thorough the difficult and hazardous passage, these lines come safe to you, they will conuey my serious and hearty congratulations of that condition you are now in neere his Ma<hi rend=sup>ty</hi>, wherein his gracious fauour and your owne merit haue concurrently placed you. Though I haue receiued noe letter from you since your arrivall in Schotland, yett I injoy the fruits of your care and kindnesse towards mee, witnesse the <num value="2">two</num> warrants of his Ma<hi rend=sup>tie</hi>, dated y<hi rend=sup>e</hi>
<num value="4">4</num> Aprill <num value="3">3</num><hi rend=sup>o</hi> Car. <datestruct value="1651--"><year reg="1651">1651</year></datestruct>, directed to Prince Rupert and to Mr. Windam in my behalfe, for which as I render all humble acknowledgements to my most Gracious and Royall Maister, soe, I giue you also my hearty thankes for beinge soe happily instrumentall in a concernment of mine, though hithertoo neyther of them haue prouued any way aduantageous unto mee, for I can giue noe account where Pr. Rupert is since his comminge into the Ocean, and takinge some rich shipps belonginge to the Kinge of Spaine, and to the Genoese: And when I addresse any demands to Mr. Windham, hee makes mee noe returne butt these kind of warrants, such as the inclosed, of which he hath many. Soe that unlesse his Ma<hi rend=sup>ty</hi> be pleased eyther to thinke of some other way of supply for mee, or direct some more effectuall commands to Mr. Windam, your kindsman and his family must (for ought I see) begge bread (or starue) in the streetes of Paris. In March last Mr. Windam assigned mee a <num value="1000">thousand</num> guilders of Dunkirke money, which makes little aboue fourescore pistolls <pb id="p.352" n="352">

here. Butt the man (<num value="1">one</num> John Arden) in whose hands he had deposited the prize goods out of which this summ was to bee raysed, is soe insoluent that he lyes in prison eyther nott able or not willinge to giue any satisfaction. The truth of this will bee confirmed to you by word of mouth by Mr. Edgman, of whose safe arriuall with you, and returne into these parts, I should be gladd to heare. 
<p>The affaires of this kingdome are in a dubious condition, occasioned chiefly by reason of some jealosies betweene the Queene Regent and the Princes; to which the neere approachinge majority (the <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=sup>th</hi>. <num value="7">7</num><hi rend=sup>r</hi>.) will, in probability giue a period, <num value="1">one</num> way or other, by a more firme settlement of the authority, ministery, and direction of affaires. As for the aspect towards vs, all I can say to you is, it will bee answerable to the successe of his Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi>
affaires in schottland, vppon which they here looke as the North Pole-starre by which they intend to steere. Our good Queene spends much of her time of late in a new Monastery at the end of Queene Mother's Cours (formerly the faire and pleasant house of Mar<hi rend=sup>l</hi> Basompeere at Challiot) of which shee is the titular foundresse; and the sweete Duke of Yorke doth here subsist vppon the allowance of <num value="1000">one thousand</num> crownes a month payd him from this state, beinge greatly esteemed by all for his comelinesse and personall dexterity, in his behauiour and exercises. 
<p>Amongst all the publique and priuat calamities wherwith it hath pleased God to visit my poore family, wee yett (by His gracious blessinge and mercy) injoy our healths, and the hopes of a better condition, when eyther our humiliations, or our enemies sinnes shall moue the Divine power to looke more fauourably vppon vs; in order to the obtaininge wheroff I yet make shifte to keep vp a chappell and the Inglish Liturgie in my house, where, by ordinary and extraordinary deuotions wee implore Gods blessinges vppon his Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> person and just cause. To that divine Omnipotency <pb id="p.353" n="353">

<p>Postscript. Extract of a letter from Nantes. <num value="15">15</num><hi rend=sup>th</hi> Aug<hi rend=sup>t</hi>.

This is written by a good hand from Lisbone. 
<p>Wee heere hope the newes of Schottland, and the defeat in Fife, is nott soe bad as the London prints would make vs beleeue. I pray God send us some comfortable tidinges, and bless his Ma<hi rend=sup>ty</hi>. with victory and successe in all his undertakinges.</text>
