<p>The <num value="1">one</num> domestic question at present uppermost in the public mind is the social condition of the humbler classes. It has been forced upon us by a winter of unexampled severity; by an amount of national distress, not at all exceptional in the cold season, which has gone to the very verge of bread riots; <NOTE>Extract from a report in the <hi rend=italics>Morning Star</hi>, <datestruct VALUE="1861-01-18"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=18>18</day>, <year reg=1861>1861</year></datestruct>.- <QUOTE>Owing to the continuance of the frost, and all outdoor labour being stopped, the distress and suffering that prevail in the metropolis, particularly among the dock labourers, bricklayers, masons, and labouring classes at the East End, are truly horrible. Throughout the day thousands congregate round the approaches of the different workhouses and unions, seeking relief, but it has been impossible for the officers to supply <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3">third</num> that applied. This led to considerable dissatisfaction, and hundreds have perambulated the different streets seeking alms of the inhabitants and of the passers-by. On Tuesday night much alarm was produced by an attack made on a large number of bakers' shops in the vicinity of the Whitechapel Road and Commercial Road East. They were surrounded by a mob of about <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> in number, who cleared the shops of the bread they contained, and then decamped. On Wednesday night, however, affairs assumed a more threatening character, and acts of violence were committed. By some means it became known, in the course of the afternoon, that the dock labourers intended to visit Whitechapel in a mass, as soon as dusk set in, and that an attack would be made on all the provision shops in that locality. This led to a general shutting up of the shops almost throughout the East End--a precaution highly necessary, for between <num value="7">seven</num> and <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock thousands congregated in the principal streets and proceeded in a body from street to street. An attack was made upon many of the bakers' shops and eatinghouses, and every morsel of food was carried away. A great many thieves and dissipated characters mingled with the mob, and many serious acts of violence were committed. The mounted police of the district were present, but it was impossible for them to act against so large a number of people. Yesterday, the streets were thronged with groups of the unemployed, seeking relief of the passers-by. In the outskirts similar scenes were observed, and in some instances acts approaching intimidation were resorted to to obtain alms.</QUOTE> 
</NOTE> and by agitations in the <pb id="p.4" n="4"> press and on the platform for an immediate improvement in labourers' cottages. The chief streets of the metropolis have been haunted for weeks by gaunt labourers, who have moaned out <pb id="p.5" n="5"> a song of want that has penetrated the thickest walls. The workhouses have been daily besieged by noisy and half-famished crowds; the clumsy poor-law system, with its <num value="23000">twenty-three thousand</num> officers, its boards, and its <num value="12000">twelve thousand</num> annual reports, has notoriously broken down; the working clergy, and the London magistrates, worn out and exhausted, have been the willing almoners of stray benevolence; Dorcas societies, soup-kitchens, ragged-schools, asylums, refuges, and all the varied machinery of British charity, have been strained to the utmost; and now we may sit down and congratulate ourselves that only a few of our fellow-creatures have been starved to death. The storm to all appearance has passed, but the really poor will feel the effects of those <num value="2">two</num> bitter months-<datestruct VALUE="1860-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, and <datestruct VALUE="1861-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>-for years. It is doubtful if there was not more real privation in February than in January of the present year; and the registrar-general's return of deaths from starvation--the most awful of all deaths--for the mild week ending <datestruct value="0-02-16"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=16>16</day></datestruct>, had certainly increased. <pb id="p.6" n="6"> There has been no lack of generosity on the part of those who have been able to give. The full purse has been everywhere found open, and thousands have asked to be shown real suffering, and the best mode of relieving it. A local taxation, cheerfully and regularly paid, of <measure value="18000000l." type=currency><num value="18000000">18,000,000</num>l.</measure> per annum, beyond the Government burden, is either inadequate for the purposes to which it is applied, or applied in the most wasteful and unskilful manner. The sum, or its administration, is unable to do its work. The metropolis, not to speak of other towns, is not <QUOTE>managed,</QUOTE> not cleansed, not relieved from the spectre of starvation which dances before us at our doors. We are evidently surrounded by a dense population, half buried in black kitchens and sewer-like courts and alleys, who are not raised by any real or fancied advance in wages; whose way of life is steeped in ignorance, dirt, and crime; and who are always ready to sink, even to death, at their usual period of want. How many they really number, what they really profess to be, and in what proportion they may be found in different parts of the metropolis, <pb id="p.7" n="7"> are secrets that no census has ever fully exposed. 
<p>We are a little too apt to pride ourselves on our material growth, and to overlook the quality in the quantity of our population. <num value="30">Thirty</num> millions of people in the United Kingdom-<num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10">tenth</num> of whom belong to London proper-make a very pretty figure in returns and official documents, until they come to be carefully sifted and examined. Taken in the bulk, with a lofty statistical disregard of minds and souls, they show an undoubted advance in capital and prosperity. Taken in detail, in a kind of house-to-house visitation, they show that the spreading limbs of a great city may be healthy and vigorous, while its heart may gradually become more choked up and decayed. 
<p>A vast deal of life that skulks or struggles in London is only familiar to the hard-working clergy, certain medical practitioners, and a few parochial officers. It burrows in holes and corners, at the back of busy thoroughfares, where few know of its existence, or care to follow it. <pb id="p.8" n="8"> The largest and most painstaking directories pass it by; writers upon London reject it as too mean, too repulsive, or too obscure; and novelists, when they condescend to touch it, for the sake of obtaining contrasts, often paint it in the colours of imagination, rather than in the hard outlines of fact. Its records, if truthfully given, have little romance, little beauty, and little variety. Poverty, ignorance, dirt, immorality, crime, are the <num value="5">five</num> great divisions of its history. Immovability, love of place, a determination to huddle together, are some of its chief characteristics; and the growth of many courts and alleys, disgraceful to humanity, is the sure result. Whatever is demanded in London, whether in defiance of law or public decency, is promptly supplied; and ill-constructed, ill-ventilated lurking nests of dwellings exist in every quarter of the metropolis, in obedience to this rule of trade. 
<p>Those who wish to search London for gross examples of overcrowded dwellings may find them in the centre, or in any <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="4">four</num> outskirts. Soho, St. James's, Westminster, and <pb id="p.9" n="9"> St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, can lay no claim to purity in this respect; and that part of Westminster known as Tothill Fields is notoriously <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest offenders. In the west there is Knightsbridge, rendered filthy and immoral by the presence of its large military barracks, with Chelsea, and Brentford; in the south there are Lambeth, Walworth, embracing Lock's Fields, and the Borough, with its notorious Kent Street; in the north there is Agar Town, built on a swamp, and running down to the canal in every stage of dirt and decay, with Somers' Town, Kentish Town, and Camden Town, each contributing its share to the general mass of misery; and in the east there are St. George's, Whitechapel, Bethnal Green, and overgrown Shoreditch. A melancholy list like this could be filled up for pages by any <num value="1">one</num> familiar with the back streets of London. I have not touched upon the corners of Clerkenwell, of <QUOTE>merry Islington,</QUOTE> and a dozen other districts; and I have purposely omitted St. Giles's and Saffron Hill, because they no longer represent the worst parts of London. I <pb id="p.10" n="10"> have merely taken a broad glance round the metropolis, to show that overcrowding amongst the poor, with all its attendant evils, is not peculiar to any particular parish or district. 
<p>The features of this huddling together vary slightly in different neighbourhoods, being governed, in some degree, by the character of the houses. In neighbourhoods that have <QUOTE>seen better days</QUOTE> --where family mansions that were once inhabited by city merchants, or the leading clerks and managers in banks or offices, have sunk gradually through all the different grades of lodging-houses, <QUOTE>classical and commercial</QUOTE> schools, down to workshops for cabinet-makers, turners, or ginger-beer brewers--the overcrowding takes the form of living in what are called <QUOTE>tenements.</QUOTE> The old mansion, faded and dilapidated, with its garden cut off, it may be, for a skittle-ground or a factory, is let out to a dozen or <num value="15">fifteen</num> families, according to the number of its rooms. Its broad staircase, broken, shattered, and muddy, is always open to the street; and its long, narrow windows are patched with paper. <pb id="p.11" n="11"> Its broad closets and store-chambers are now filled with ragged children, who share their rough beds with coals, coke, wood, and a few cooking utensils. Its dark wainscotings, scratched and chipped, are hung with damp yellow clothes, that are always <QUOTE>in the wash;</QUOTE> its passages are often strewn with oyster-shells and broken tobacco-pipes; and its fore-court is filled with ashes, <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> rusty, broken saucepans, like old hats, and sometimes with a dead cat,--the playthings of the crowd of dirty children, who roll about on its hard, black earth. The iron railings that once closed it in from the thoroughfare have been long torn away, stolen, destroyed, sold; and all that remains of the low wall in which they were fixed may be a few rotten, jagged bricks standing on <num value="1">one</num> side. I can find scores of such houses-containing <num value="40">forty</num>, <num value="50">fifty</num>, or even <num value="60">sixty</num> human beings, surrounded by neighbourhoods crowded with gas factories, cooperages, and different workshops, or pierced by the dark arches of metropolitan railways--that stand within <num value="2">two</num> miles of the Bank of England, and that <pb id="p.12" n="12"> once were looked upon as pleasant country retreats! 
<p>Dropping, however, this description of Ragged London, drawn from memory, let us go out into the ragged streets, and ragged houses, and see what the ragged people are doing in <datestruct VALUE="1861-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>. We will begin with Ragged London in the centre. 

<div2 type="chapter" n="1" id="c.1"><HEAD>Clerkenwell and the City Borders.</HEAD>
<pb id="p.13" n="13"> 
 
<p>We have been too much accustomed of late years to look upon certain notorious localities as representing the only plague-spots in London. They have been visited by day, inspected by night; have formed the text-books of preachers, the back-bones of sanitary reports, and the building materials of popular authors. They have attained an exaggerated importance in the public mind, and have been erroneously regarded as the tumours of our social degradation. The sweepings of society have seldom been carefully traced to their hiding-places, and fancy neighbourhoods have been created upon paper, and peopled with the phantoms of imagination. Where are the emaciated children who have often been, dangled before our eyes? Certainly not in the <pb id="p.14" n="14"> black-holes inhabited by the poor. What is it that gives fulness to the cheeks, agility to the limbs, and even bone and sinew to the form? It cannot be food. A block of coarse bread, taken at uncertain intervals, is far from forming the supposed necessary <num value="3">three</num> meals a day, and yet those children who get nothing but this plain and scanty fare astonish those who know them best with their healthy vigour. These children live in the streets, and draw their nourishment from wind and mud. They are not stunted, far from it, and with few exceptions are stronger than the children of the middle class. 
<p>The close, crowded borders of the city of London haves been touched upon too frequently in some parts, too little in others. We have heard enough of Saffron Hill, and have been lectured about a certain refuge in Field Lane until we have almost forgotten that there are any more refuges in the world. The homeless wanderer must be housed, the starving castaway must be fed; but the great work to be done is to improve the habits of the industrious poor. <pb id="p.15" n="15"> If there were no such thing as <QUOTE>social science,</QUOTE> no meddling legislation, no local Government Act with boards and inspectors, no vestries, no committees, and no guardians (save the mark!), society might settle down in its chosen places, and no <num value="1">one</num> take any heed of any <num value="1">one</num> but himself. While, however, we profess to love our neighbours as ourselves, and establish costly public systems--to say nothing of the efforts of private benevolence--to assist those who are too ignorant or too weak to help themselves, it is high time to inquire what is doing for the people in every corner of the town. There are scores of courts in Bishopsgate Street, scores more in Sun Street, Finsbury, scores more in Chiswell Street, Cripplegate, some in Lower Thames Street, others in parts of Blackfriars, that are not fit for human habitation. There are Golden Lane, Whitecross Street, 
<NOTE><p>A correspondent writing <datestruct VALUE="1861-01-20"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=20>20</day>, <year reg=1861>1861</year></datestruct>, says:-- <QUOTE>The district of which Old Street, Goswell Street, Barbican, and Whitecross Street are the boundaries, is a maze of courts swarming with people in a state of starvation.</QUOTE> 
<p>The following report of an earlier date (<datestruct VALUE="1861-01-6"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=6>6</day>, <year reg=1861>1861</year></datestruct>) also refers to the same neighbourhood:--On Monday night an inquest was held by the coroner as to the death of Sarah Brasnall, aged <num value="74">seventy-four</num>, who was discovered in a dying condition, at No. <num value="4">4</num>, Graham's Buildings, Bunhill Row, St. Luke's, and who died from exposure to the cold. The deceased was a slop-worker, and in the receipt of <measure value="1s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> per week and a loaf from the parish. On Thursday night the deceased was not about at her usual time, and on the following morning a lodger went to her room and found her lying upon the bedstead naked. It was very cold and frosty at the time. An alarm was raised, and Mr. Cullen, the surgeon, was called, but the deceased soon afterwards expired. The deceased was suffering from strangulated hernia, and her body was much emaciated. Mr. Cullen, the surgeon, said that the deceased's death had no doubt been accelerated by exposure to the inclement weather, and the want of sufficient food and clothing. The jury returned a verdict accordingly. The same evening, the coroner held an inquiry concerning the death of Hannah Coward, an infant child, who was found in a wretched condition at a low and disreputable house, in Sycamore Street, St. Luke's. The police deposed that the mother had been taken into custody on a charge of felony, but was discharged by the magistrate, and when the police went to the house they found the children in a most deplorable condition. The constables kindly took them to the workhouse, and every assistance was rendered by the authorities, but the deceased died on Friday. The police said that another child was dying from the same cause, and when the deceased was found, she had a <QUOTE>teat</QUOTE> made of a small bag of plums, which had been placed in her mouth. Dr. Love said the deceased had died from neglect, starvation, and cold; and the other child could not live. The coroner, by the special request of the jury, severely reprimanded the conduct of the mother and father, when they returned a verdict of <QUOTE>Death from want of the necessaries of life, and exposure to the weather, through the wilful neglect of the parents.</QUOTE> </NOTE>
and that melancholy avenue <pb id="p.16" n="16"> of vermin-haunted furniture called Long Alley which runs from the Curtain Road, Shoreditch, <pb id="p.17" n="17"> across Sun Street, into Moorfields,<NOTE>The Earl of Derby, speaking in the House of Lords of the parish of St. Bartholomew, Moorfields, Cripplegate, <datestruct VALUE="1861-02-28"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1861>1861</year></datestruct>, says:-- <QUOTE>The population of this parish amounts to <num value="4500">four thousand five hundred</num> odd, but I am informed by the incumbent that it may now be taken as exceeding <num value="5000">five thousand</num>. The number of houses in it does not exceed <num value="500">five hundred</num>, which gives a proportion of <num value="9">nine</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> persons to every house in the parish. There is not a single gentleman's house in it, not a single large shopkeeper. The whole population is of the poorest class, the lower order of shopkeepers, costermongers, dock labourers, and others of the poorest order of the population. There are not <num value="10">ten</num> families in it that occupy a single house, though the bulk of these houses contain only <num value="3">three</num> rooms. In fact, to use the expression of the clergyman who called on me yesterday in reference to this subject, the aristocracy in the parish are those who can indulge in the luxury of <num value="2">two</num> rooms; the great number of families have <num value="1">one</num> room only, and in many cases there is more than <num value="1">one</num> family in a room.</QUOTE> </NOTE> which are a disgrace to any country that prides itself upon its civilization. The blind alleys in coal-mines, the slimy passages of district sewers, anything that is dark and filthy, may be compared to these places. It is impossible and unnecessary to visit them all. I have known them for years, <pb id="p.18" n="18"> and, whatever sanguine clergymen or apologetic inspectors may say to the contrary, they get worse every day, and can never be improved. The tinkering of a drain, the whitewashing of a ceiling, will never remove the evils of their original structure. They are filled with labourers, artizans, needlewomen, and girls employed in many fancy trades, and the capital and enterprise of the city of London are largely responsible for them all. In the Clerkenwell district, <num value="2">two</num>-thirds of the enormous population of <num value="60">sixty</num> or <num value="70000">seventy thousand</num> depend upon the City for their support. It is the old story of workpeople who must be <QUOTE>near their bread,</QUOTE> and overcrowding follows as a matter of course. 
<p>Clerkenwell is a hard-working, operative district, especially in the interior, and contains few thieves, except those that are bottled up in prison. A penal air is given to the neighbourhood by the Houses of Correction and Detention, but, with this exception, the population is patient, industrious, and honest. Very little prostitution defiles its streets, and this not openly. The watch and <pb id="p.19" n="19"> watchcase making trades form the chief occupation of the men, and the women and children work at artificial flower-making, mantle-making, &amp;c., for the City warehouses. In its upper portion --towards Pentonville--on the top of the mountain, are numbers of large private residences; and in the lower portion-down in the valley-the parish runs into Smithfield. Many French eggmerchants, importing enormous quantities of these eatables, are scattered about the neighbourhood; and a place called Sharp's Alley was once famous for making common sausages of refuse meat, known in the slang of the district as <QUOTE>bloodworms.</QUOTE> <NOTE><emph rend=caps>Sanitary Condition of the City, <datestruct VALUE="1861-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct></emph>.-At the meeting of the City Commissioners of Sewers yesterday, <datestruct value="0-02-5"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=5>5</day></datestruct>, Dr. Letheby, the medical officer of health, reported on the state of <num value="197">one hundred and ninety-seven</num> houses that had been inspected during the week, and he submitted a list of <num value="39">thirty-nine</num> places for sanitary improvement. He also reported that the markets and slaughterhouses had been duly inspected in the course of the week, and that the officers had seized <num value="6090">6,090</num> lbs., or nearly <num value="2.75">2 3/4</num> tons, of meat, as unfit for human food. Nearly all this was meat in a state of disease. There were the carcases of <num value="56">fifty-six</num> rotten sheep, <num value="4">four</num> pigs, and <num value="34">thirty-four</num> quarters of beef, besides smaller joints. <num value="2664">2,664</num> lbs. were sized by Mr. Fisher in Newgate Market; <num value="1740">1,740</num> lbs. by Mr. Davidson in Leadenhall; and <num value="1684">1,684</num> lbs. by Mr. Newman in Aldgate, and in Tyler's Market, and elsewhere. The mortality returns for the week are still excessively high. Last week the number of deaths in the City was <num value="97">ninety-seven</num>, instead of an average of <num value="62">sixty-two</num>. 
</NOTE>
 <pb id="p.20" n="20"> 
<p>Like most places with pretensions to great antiquity, it is closely built upon. It has its old archways and remains of monastic times, and presents in many places the aspect of a cathedral city. This is a peculiarity which makes it very picturesque, but largely uninhabitable. The back courts of Rouen give materials for charming pictures; but their sanitary condition has yet to be represented. A few rags hanging out of a window, a hole without any sash in it, a tattered woman, with a shock-headed baby standing at the side of a winding alley, make a delightful water-coloured sketch when they are touched off by Prout; but not so delightful a sketch in a blue book or a descriptive paper. Clerkenwell, especially near the parish church, was laid out on a plan evidently copied from those old cities that had to be built closely so as to come within the fortified walls which formed their protection from invasion. 
<pb id="p.21" n="21">. The old courts, or outlines of courts, in the <QUOTE>Close,</QUOTE> as it is called, still remain, and are, as usual, the worst nests of overcrowding in the district. There is Union Place, a row of houses built within the last few years, and forming an alley of close, ill-ventilated dwellings. They contain <num value="2">two</num> small rooms, the size of which may be about <num value="12">twelve</num> feet square, with a cupboard of a room about half the size, and they are let for about <measure value="5s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="5">5</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> a week. As usual in these places, there is but <num value="1">one</num> public privy for all; and the population, with children, may average <num value="10">ten</num> to a house, giving more than <num value="80">eighty</num> people. The pavement was tolerably clean, and the place may rank as a <num value="1">first</num>-class court; but the rooms smelt musty for want of a through draught of air, which they can never get, as there are no windows at the back. Here we found <num value="1">one</num> woman sick and going to the infirmary, having been deserted by her husband, and another trying to support herself, her husband (who was out of work), and <num value="8">eight</num> children, by washing and house cleaning. It is astonishing what miracles a tub, a piece of <pb id="p.22" n="22"> soap, a brisk pair of arms, and a stout heart will often do. 
<p>Opposite this place, in another corner of the Close, is a lower class of court, called Cromwell Place. Here the houses are chiefly let off in rooms at from <measure value="1s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> to <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> a week, and <num value="7">seven</num> persons in <num value="1">one</num> small room--father, mother, grownup children, and infants--appear to represent the average distribution of tenants. <num value="1">One</num> family of <num value="7">seven</num>--the man a labourer at a greengrocer'shad just been discovered by the working clergy nearly naked, and provided with a few articles of clothing. The next room sheltered another family--equal in numbers, and very little better off in condition. The children were all running about with naked feet; and the rooms were barely furnished, dirty, and musty. These poor people were once far better off, and they dated their fall from a winter a few years back, when bread was at a very high price. This is not the <num value="1">first</num> time that I have heard a connection traced between present poverty and past scarcity of corn. The parlour contained another family of <num value="6">six</num>, and the <pb id="p.23" n="23"> mother had just sold her only bed to a marine-store dealer for <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure>, to stop the many little hungry mouths around her. The father had been out of work for many weeks; <num value="1">one</num> son had enlisted in the army, another had become a sailor, and a girl of <num value="14">fourteen</num> could have got a situation as a domestic servant, but she had nothing but rags to go in. This, I am sorry to say, is a very common case. The best workman in the family was a little stuttering, red-coated shoeblack, who earned his shilling every day, paid his regulation fourpence honestly over to his office, and brought home his eightpence every night to his mother. This small house contained eighteen people. 
<p>Near this alley is a lower and complex series of passages, going generally by the name of Pear-tree Court. The open space, where the orchard may have been, if we are to infer anything from the name, is now filled with every description of animal and vegetable refuse. The houses on <num value="1">one</num> side are very old, and chiefly made of wood, which is rotten and black with age; the stunted houses on the other side turn their backs <pb id="p.24" n="24"> to this space, and show yards that are actually not more than <num value="4">four</num> feet square. The alleys about this place are very numerous, with houses, dark, squeezed up, wavy in their outline, and depressed about the roof, like crushed hats. The population is almost a parish in itself, being so numerous; and in the most open parts hawkers of common china have their store-sheds. Some of the passages are so narrow that it is scarcely possible to creep up them; and tracing <num value="1">one</num> of these to its source we came to an ancient smithy, rusty brown, idle, and crowded with litter. A rotten bellows, full of rat-holes, was lying in a puddle by the side of a dismantled grindstone, and a few splinters of wood. Inside the low door of the smithy, under clusters of old rusty keys, bolts, and rings, which hung from the black, smoky rafters like grapes, were <num value="2">two</num> old yellow-shirted, dusty, grisly men in spectacles, who might have sat to Quentin Matsys for his picture of <QUOTE>The Misers.</QUOTE> <num value="1">One</num> said he had been in the parish for <num value="70">seventy</num> years, and bemoaned the decay of trade; and the other complained of <pb id="p.25" n="25"> the competition of <QUOTE>furriners.</QUOTE> The sunlight shone through a broken window into the hollow forge, showing the black cinders, and a blacker cat. 
<p>The landlord of all this unsightly property keeps his own missionary and his own doctor to look after his tenants; but he neither ventilates the rooms nor enlarges the stifling yards. A little more cleanliness might help the missionary, and would certainly lessen the doctor's work. 
<p>Near Pear-tree Court is a settlement called Red Lion Gardens--the remains probably of Clerkenwell, when it was a country village. The entrance to this place is between those dingy brokers' shops, which look out upon the bleak hills of dirt accumulated on each side of New Farringdon Street. It is at the upper end, nearly opposite the workhouse, and is not easily found. It contains several rows of low <num value="1">one</num>-roomed cottages, with little square yards in front, and is very much like similar places about Hoxton, Holywell Mount, Shoreditch, and other outskirts. In <num value="1">one</num> room, or cottage, was a labourer with his <pb id="p.26" n="26"> wife and <num value="6">six</num> children; in another was a poor cabman and family--the man trying to mend a very rotten pair of shoes to go out in, having sold his best pair off his feet. He had just come out of prison, where he had been sent for <num value="5">five</num> days, because he was summoned for hanging about the Great Northern Railway Terminus with his cab, and had no money to pay the fine. He was civil and intelligent, and his room, though poorly furnished, was very clean. At another cottage a young woman was standing, waiting for her mother to return and open the closed door. She had come some little distance to see her father--an old, blind street fiddler--who was ill in bed with a fever. The mother had gone to the public soup-kitchen to try and get some food, and had locked the door; the old man was too ill and helpless to rise and open it. While we were talking to the young woman, who told us that she was a brushmaker, living in Finsbury, and that her husband was a butcher's man, out of work, in consequence of the badness of trade, the mother came back, with her bonnet in her <pb id="p.27" n="27"> hand, and her apron all in tatters. She had been roughly treated in the crowd at the soup-kitchen, as all the really poor, weak, and helpless always are; and while greasy tramps, low thieves and their girls, and other unworthy objects, got in (as I saw afterwards at Clerkenwell, and also at the Leicester Square soup-kitchen), the decent old fiddler's wife came empty away. She burst into tears as she told her daughter this, and was some time before she could be comforted. They were not beggars, not tramps, and were clean and honest. We went into the cottage--I and the excellent clergymen who accompanied me where the old fiddler was propped up in bed. The doctor had ordered him some beef-tea--a rather costly luxury for a blind fiddler! 
<p> <QUOTE>He's brought up a heavy family,</QUOTE> said the old woman, <QUOTE>and never asked nobody for anything, until the frost bit him, and now he's dropped from his eating.</QUOTE> 
<p>The old man recognized the voice of <num value="1">one</num> of the clergymen, and seemed pleased with the goodness of his memory and ear. The gentleman was the <pb id="p.28" n="28"> son of some <num value="1">one</num> before whose door the old fiddler had played for many years. 
<p> <QUOTE>Very proud I am to hear that voice,</QUOTE> whispered the old man, <QUOTE>and many's the sixpence I've had from your father, God bless him.</QUOTE> 
<p>Street hawkers and street minstrels are not ungrateful vagrants and thieves, and it would be a pity if they were, for the London courts and alleys shelter about <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> of them. I know much of working people of all kinds, and I have seen hundreds of bright, open, honest faces under the battered hats and bonnets of costermongers. 
<NOTE><p>On Thursday, <datestruct VALUE="1860-12-13"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=13>13</day>, <year reg=1860>1860</year></datestruct>, a meeting of street vendors of the metropolis was held at the sale-room of Messrs. Keeling and Hunt, Monument Yard; Mr. Keeling in the chair. There were a good many costermongers present on the occasion. The chairman said the street vendors were at present the principal means of conveying provisions to the artisan class of the community. But they were interfered with in the pursuit of their useful calling, were subjected to fine and imprisonment, and were told when they were following their occupation that they were violating the law. The great objection made against them was that they obstructed the thoroughfares, but if that was an objection it applied equally to others. Were it not for the street vendors, the goods which they circulated would not be brought to London <pb n="p.29"> at all. All they wanted was to be allowed a fair opportunity of following their calling. The hon. secretary then read a very respectful petition to the Court of Aldermen, stating fully the nature of their grievances. Mr. H. Isaacs moved the adoption of the petition, and the appointment of a deputation to present it to the City authorities. The resolution was seconded, and unanimously adopted. The next resolution-- <QUOTE>That this meeting pledges itself to protect the street vendors from interference when lawfully pursuing their calling, by placing it in their power to employ counsel to defend them when unjustly prosecuted</QUOTE> --was moved by Mr. Brooke, seconded by Mr. Wallace, and adopted. Solomon Green was afraid there were thieves in other callings besides street vendors. He believed that not much less than <measure value="3000000l." type=currency><num value="3000000">3,000,000</num>l.</measure> of money was invested in various articles by the costermongers throughout the country, and if they were only true to themselves he had no doubt they would be able to protect their capital. 
<p>A vote of thanks to the chairman closed the proceedings. 
</NOTE>
 <pb id="p.29" n="29"> 
<p>The freehold property in Clerkenwell often belongs to charities and corporations. Berry Street, Little Sutton Street, and other places lying off Wilderness Row--very fair specimens of the dull, badly-built, badly-ventilated, overcrowded streets of the neighbourhood--are laid out on ground belonging to the Charter House. Lamb-and-Flag Court, Fryingpan Alley, and several other branches of the same property--the lowest and most degraded in the parish-were left by <num value="1">one</num> William Sanderson, in <datestruct value="1659--"><year reg="1659">1659</year></datestruct>, to be <pb id="p.30" n="30"> divided equally between the poor of Clerkenwell and the poor of Wendover, Buckinghamshire. The property is now divided, doubtless under many leases and sub-leases, amongst tenants who are proud of their dirty habits. Fryingpan Alley is what I should call a rampant court. Its entrance is <num value="2">two</num> feet wide--a long narrow slit in the wall--half paved, with a gutter which constantly trickles with sewage. Its tenants are chiefly gipsies and the lowest class of vegetable vendors. It is worse than anything in Whitechapel or Bethnal Green. The rooms are dustbins--everything but dwelling-places. The women are masculine in appearance; they stand with coarse, folded arms and knotted hair, and are ready to fight for their castle of filth. They dislike the new underground railway that is forming in the neighbourhood; they look upon New Farringdon Street as a Corporation job; and they have got a rude notion that all local improvements put money into the pockets of Government. Children make faces at you; repulsive men smoke down upon you from the <pb id="p.31" n="31"> holes that serve for windows; old women howl at you from the gloomy cellars; and a spreading heap of wet, muddy vegetable refuse, lying in an open spot that an inhabitant called <QUOTE>the square,</QUOTE> was regarded like part of old William Sanderson's freehold. An idle, pipe-sucking giant, who was offered sixpence to clear away this nuisance, walked slowly round it, looked at it reflectively --not to say affectionately--and finally decided that he had better leave it alone. Such a place as this, with its old herring-casks standing at the dark doors, its rags hanging across from house to house, and its swarthy defenders, would make a very telling picture upon canvas, like many of its companions. Its reform, I am afraid, is beyond the reach of anything, except an earthquake or a new railway, and even then the inhabitants would only be pushed somewhere else.<NOTE>The Metropolitan Railway projects of <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct> are estimated to destroy <num value="1000">one thousand</num> houses in low neighbourhoods, and displace a population of not less than <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num>.</NOTE>
 
<p>The greater part of this enormous neighbourhood is actively watched over by the Rev. Robert <pb id="p.32" n="32"> Maguire, the rector of the parish church, and a staff of <num value="3">three</num> hard-working, business-like curates. 
<p>In the fine weather they preach much in the open air, and the rector says:-- 
<p> <QUOTE>This very successful portion of our summer work was conducted last season with much spirit and energy, not indeed on my part, but through the services of Mr. Tindall and Mr. Herbert. I felt much disappointed that, from illness and other causes, I could avail myself of so few opportunities of preaching in the streets. My place and duties, however, were well supplied by Mr. Tindall, who occupied the station on the Green on Sunday evenings, during my absence, and preached with much profit to the people. The other preaching stations were occupied, more or less, during the summer, with the same gratifying success which has attended all such efforts for the spiritual instruction of the people. <num value="1">One</num> man remarked, a few evenings after hearing an open-air sermon by <num value="1">one</num> of my curates,-- <Q> Well, no sermon, in church or anywhere else, ever stuck to me so tight as that did: I can't get rid of it.</Q> </QUOTE> <pb id="p.33" n="33"> 
<p>The visiting--to say nothing of the mere church labour-must be enormous.

There is a Bible society, a working-man's institute, a pure literature society; and, amongst the institutions largely self-supporting, there is a clothing fund, and a provident fund.

The rector and those who work with him. do everything they can to cultivate the friendship of the poorest parishioners, by means of social gatherings at different periods of the year. It is no uncommon thing to see <num value="2000">2,000</num> of the poor assembled at <num value="1">one</num> of these gatherings, enjoying themselves in a manner they could never hope to <pb id="p.35" n="35"> do at their own wretched homes. Husbands come with their wives, and children with their parents, and every <num value="1">one</num> is made to feel happy and at ease. Many of them spoke to me about these meetings during my morning's walk, and spoke utterly free from cant, or a desire to appear pious. There can be little doubt that such gatherings are not only kindly conceived, but very happily conducted by the curates and the rector. They do their best with the vast district committed to their charge, and will only fail in curing those evils that are beyond the reach of charity or preaching.

<p>If I were writing a partially fancy description of the poverty and wretchedness in a particular district, I should mix the aspects of <num value="1">one</num> street with the aspects of another, and hide my real locality under a very thin veil. I should call Whitechapel by its more appropriate name of Blackchapel, and play with the East of London under the title of St. George's-in-the-Dirt. As this book, however, is intended to be a faithful chronicle of what I have seen, what the local clergy and others see every day, and almost every hour, and what every <num value="1">one</num> else may see in a week's walk about the back streets of London, I give up effect for the sake of truthfulness, and strive to become a plain, matter-of-fact guide. <pb id="p.40" n="40"> 
<p>There are many different degrees of social degradation and unavoidable poverty, even in the east. Whitechapel, properly so called, may not be the worst of the many districts in this quarter; but it is undoubtedly bad enough. Taking the broad road from Aldgate Church to old Whitechapel Church, a thoroughfare, in some parts, like the high street of an old-fashioned country town, you may pass on either side about <num value="20">twenty</num> narrow avenues, leading to thousands of closely-packed nests, full to overflowing with dirt, and misery, and rags. Many living signs of the inner life behind the busy shops are always oozing out on to the pavements and into the gutters; for all children in low neighbourhoods that are not taken in by the ragged and other charity schools are always living in the streets: they eat in the streets what little they get to eat, they play in the streets in all weathers, and sometimes they have to sleep in the streets. Their fathers and mothers mope in cellars or garrets; their grandfathers or grandmothers huddle and die in the same miserable dustbins (for <pb id="p.41" n="41"> families, even unto the <num value="3">third</num> and <num value="4">fourth</num> generation, have often to keep together in these places), but the children dart about the roads with naked, muddy feet; slink into corners to play with oyster-shells and pieces of broken china, or are found tossing halfpennies under the arches of a railway. The local clergy, those who really throw themselves heart and soul into the labour of educating these outcasts, are daily pained by seeing <num value="1">one</num> or more drop through into the great pit of crime; and by feeling that ragged schools are often of little good unless they can give food as well as instruction, and offer the children some kind of rude probationary home. At the George Yard Ragged School, Whitechapel, conducted by the Rev. Mr. Thornton, and personally superintended by Mr. Holland, they have turned part of an old distillery into <num value="1">one</num> of the most useful and active institutions of this kind in the metropolis, and they are already struggling with these and other difficulties. The secretary, Mr. Lewis, writing January <num value="151861">15,1861</num>, says:-- <pb id="p.42" n="42"> 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>We have lately had a number of boys in a most distressing state-homeless, hungry, and almost naked. The teachers and friends have done what they could to help them, and can do no more. Those who teach the  <Q>ragged band</Q>  have feeling hearts, and it is painful to lie in <num value="1">one</num>'s own bed and feel that there are a number of poor boys wanting even shelter these bitter nights. Should we send them away and they perish in the streets, at our doors certainly would their deaths lie. We have paid for their lodgings, at various lodging-houses, night after night; but now with this severe weather, and the mass of distress it has brought around us, matters have come to such a pass we are compelled to ask the public to lend us a helping hand in our extremity. We have taken a place to shelter them in, and earnestly ask for help to go on. Old boots and shoes, old clothes, old rugs or blankets, rice, potatoes, oatmeal, &amp;c., will be most acceptable. To send these helpless ones adrift is, apart from anything else, to make thieves of them.</QUOTE>
 <pb id="p.43" n="43"> 
<p>They have gathered some <num value="400">four hundred</num> children, of all ages, and of both sexes.; and they give them every encouragement to consider the school as their home. They provide a meal of rice on <num value="1">one</num> day, a meal of bread on another; and a meal of soup, if they can, on the <num value="3">third</num> day; and they have taken <num value="8">eight</num> poor castaways- nobody's children-- <QUOTE>into the house,</QUOTE> and are endeavouring to train them into honest working boys. The stories of destitution, cruelty, and desertion which these outcasts have to tell are more harrowing than a <num value="1000">thousand</num> tragedies. <num value="1">One</num> has lost all traces of his parents, another is a street beggar's orphan, and another owns no parent but a drunken prostitute, who kicked him, swore at him, stabbed him in the cheek, and left a scar which he will carry to his grave. He can now find no traces of such a mother, except in the cruel mark upon his face; and is more happy, perhaps, in calling his schoolmaster father than he ever was before in his life. 
<p>The conductors of this school are anxious to fit up some kind of rough sleeping-loft for the <pb id="p.44" n="44"> children. They dread to let them go out into the black courts and alleys, knowing what dirt and brutality often await them. It requires very little diving behind the houses on either side of the Whitechapel main road to account for this feeling on the part of the ragged-school managers. Within a few yards of this refuge is New Court, a nest of thieves, filled with thick-lipped, broadfeatured, rough-haired, ragged women, and hulking, leering men, who stand in knots, tossing for pennies, or lean against the walls at the entrances of the low courts. The houses present every conceivable aspect of filth and wretchedness; the broken windows are plastered with paper, which rises and falls when the doors of the rooms are opened; the staircases always look upon the court, as there is seldom any street door, and they are steep, winding, and covered with blocks of hard mud. The faces that peer out of the narrow windows are yellow and repulsive; some are the faces of Jews, some of Irishwomen, and some of sickly-looking infants. The ashes lie in front of the houses; the drainage is thrown out of the <pb id="p.45" n="45"> windows to swell the heap; and the public privy is like a sentry-box stuck against the pump in a corner of the court. There may be as many families as there are rooms, cellars, and cupboards in a single house; <num value="40">forty</num> people, perhaps, huddled together in a small dwelling; and if there is not a mixture of different families in <num value="1">one</num> room it is due to the ceaseless vigilance of the sanitary officer, Inspector Price, in carrying out the Lodging-Houses Act. The lowest order of Irish, when they get an opportunity, will take a room and sub-let it to as many families as the floor will hold. Inkhorn Court is a fair sample of an Irish colony; the houses are <num value="3">three</num> stories high, and there is not a corner unoccupied. Tewkesbury Buildings is a colony of Dutch Jews, and, if anything, they are a little cleaner than their Christian neighbours. George Yard is an English colony, numbering about a <num value="100">hundred</num> families; and Wentworth Street, Crown Court, and, Castle Alley have the same character. Their inhabitants are chiefly dock labourers, and their families a class who form <num value="1">one</num>-half of the population of this <pb id="p.46" n="46"> district. A correspondent, Mr. Wilford, of Catherine Street East, writing <datestruct VALUE="1861-01-10"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=10>10</day>, <year reg=1861>1861</year></datestruct>, says :-- <QUOTE>The dock labourers consist of a mixed class of people-English, Irish, Scotch, Germans, and a few French, and others. There are employed at times as many as <num value="20000">20,000</num> to <num value="25000">25,000</num> labourers in the <num value="5">five</num> docks, who are extra men, and about <num value="3000">3,000</num> or <num value="4000">4,000</num> permanent men; and at the wharves below London Bridge there are at times as many as <num value="3000">3,000</num> men employed, making a total of upwards of <num value="30000">30,000</num> men employed in the docks and wharves below bridge. It is thought at the present time that there are not more than <num value="4000">4,000</num> or <num value="5000">5,000</num> who are at work, owing to the adverse winds and the severe frost. The average earnings of thousands of these poor fellows is not more than <measure value="7s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="7">7</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> per week all the year round, so that when there is a great stagnation in the shipping trade, many thousands are almost starved to death. It is a lamentable fact that such is the case at the present time.</QUOTE> The other half of the inhabitants in these streets is made up of thieves, costermongers, and <pb id="p.47" n="47"> stall-keepers, professional beggars, rag-dealers, brokers and small tradesmen. 
<p>In <num value="1">one</num> court I saw a singular blind labourer, who was out of work in consequence of the frost. He got his living by reading the Bible in the street, feeling the raised letters with his hand, and he complained that he could do nothing now because <QUOTE>the touch was cold.</QUOTE> He staggered over the mud heaps with a thin stick, and disappeared in the dark, cellar-like lower room of a ragged-school refuge for outcasts. In some of these repulsive courts the inhabitants cling to a rude love of flowers, and many an unsightly window-ledge is fitted up to resemble a garden enclosure, with miniature railings and gates. 
<p>The rents drawn for the wretched apartments in these courts vary from <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>s.</measure> to <measure value="9d." type=currency><num value="9">9</num>d.</measure> a week, the average being about <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>s.</measure> a week. This rental often pays for the hire of <QUOTE>furniture,</QUOTE> consisting of a round table, white with age, a couple of bare wooden chairs, a fender and poker, often, unfortunately, not wanted except when the parish coals are being sparingly burnt; a turn--up <pb id="p.48" n="48"> bedstead, with a rustling bag of straw for a bed, and a very dirty scanty coverlet. The rent for this accommodation is collected painfully, punctually, and incessantly by small instalments; and unpromising as this class of property looks to the superficial observer, thriving tradesmen are found to <QUOTE>farm</QUOTE> it in the neighbourhood as middlemen, and in some cases it belongs to important local residents. The Jews have bought a little of it up of late years, perhaps because their colony in this quarter is slowly increasing. The Jewish poor are fewer and better provided for than our poor, and the applications for relief are never made except in cases of extreme distress. They are wonderfully independent and self-supporting, and keep up the ceremonies of their nation under the most adverse circumstances. In a very black miserable hut in Castle Alley, a poor Jewess was burning the <QUOTE>twelvemonth's lamp</QUOTE> for her deceased mother, although it was only a glimmering wick in a saucer full of rank oil. 
<p>The female population in these courts and alleys, as usual, forms the greatest social difficulty <pb id="p.49" n="49"> to be dealt with. Their husbands may be dock labourers, earning, when employed, if on the <QUOTE>permanent list,</QUOTE> <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> a day--if on the <QUOTE>casual list,</QUOTE> only <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> a day; their children, after an education in the streets or the ragged schools, may be drafted off into lucifer-match or brush factories, where cheap and juvenile labour is in much demand; but for the woman, and the grownup daughters, although it may be necessary for them to help in maintaining the poor household, there is nothing but ill-paid needlework, which they may never have learnt. Domestic servitude in this neighbourhood, with a few exceptions, is not to be coveted, as there is little more, for the local-bred servant, than a choice of low ginshops, or lower coffee-houses. The best paid occupation appears to be prostitution, and it is a melancholy fact that a nest of bad houses in Angel Alley, supported chiefly by the farmers' men who bring the hay and straw to Whitechapel market twice a week, are the cleanestlooking dwellings in the district. The windows have tolerably neat green blinds, the doors have <pb id="p.50" n="50"> brass plates, and inside the houses there is comparative comfort, if not plenty. While the wretched virtuous population are starving in black holes, or creeping out in the hour of their wildest prosperity to purchase sixpennyworth of refuse meat from the stall opposite the greasy, sawdusty shambles, the inhabitants of this court of vice know little, at least for a few years, of want and suffering. If their ranks are thinned by death or disease, there are always fresh recruits coming forward; and must be while there are as many houseless women as men, and nothing but low threepenny lodging-houses, where little or no distinction is made between the sexes. I heard a child in the street--a boy about <num value="8">eight</num> years of age-telling another boy what a man had given his mother as the price of her shame. The boys and girls here are men and women at <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> years of age. 
<p>The local clergy are painfully aware of these facts, and they have made an effort with some success to check the evils of prostitution. The indefatigable incumbent of St. Jude's--the <pb id="p.51" n="51"> Rev. Mr. Thornton before alluded to--with local assistance, has started a temporary refuge for females in Boar's Head Yard, Petticoat Lane, in the very heart of this melancholy district. The work of this refuge commenced in <datestruct VALUE="1860-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>. Since that period it appears that <num value="64">sixty-four</num> young women--mostly fallen, some in danger--nearly all from the neighbourhood, have passed through the institution; of these <num value="16">sixteen</num> are in situations doing well, <num value="7">seven</num> have been restored to their friends, <num value="1">one</num> is married, <num value="1">one</num> has died, <num value="19">nineteen</num> have been sent to other institutions; and of the remaining <num value="20">twenty</num> some have left, with approval, to seek an honest living; some have proved failures, having left soon after admission from dislike of the discipline or other causes; and <num value="8">eight</num> are now in the refuge, making the total <num value="72">seventy-two</num>. This excellent institution is in some degree self-supporting, the inmates earning money by washing, mangling, and needlework. By this means the cost of each case has been kept down to about <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> a week. The receipts from work are small, in consequence <pb id="p.52" n="52"> of the constant change of inmates, the institution being designed as a temporary refuge, not as a permanent home. The managers, consisting of a committee of ladies, solicit female clothing, assistance in procuring more work for the inmates, and the inspection of visitors, especially ladies. <pb id="p.53" n="53"> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="3" id="c.3"><HEAD>St. George's in the East.</HEAD>
 
<p>Passing from Whitechapel towards the river into the Commercial Road, you find the thoroughfare <num value="1">one</num> of the broadest in London, with stone tramways for waggon traffic laid down on each side as far as Blackwall. This main road, viewed at any hour, shows little evidence of the crowded population who huddle together behind the houses, especially on the river-side. The difference in the superficial appearance of this road, compared with Whitechapel, may be accounted for by the fact that it is pierced by very few courts and alleys, strictly so called, the small dwellings being invariably arranged in streets. There are thousands of these streets spread over Stepney, Limehouse, Shadwell, St. George's, and Mile End, having such a family likeness that the description of <num value="1">one</num> in its main features will serve for them <pb id="p.54" n="54"> all. Their houses look flat and depressed, being only <num value="1">one</num> story high, and they generally contain <num value="2">two</num> small rooms on the ground floor, <num value="2">two</num> more above, with a very close little yard, seldom larger than <num value="1">one</num> of the rooms. When they are new, clean, and in the possession of their original tenants, they shelter a hard-working class, chiefly connected with the shipping trade and the different factories in the east; and when they fall a few degrees in the scale of comfort and respectability, they follow the example of more wealthy neighbourhoods and admit a lower colony of tenants. From being occupied by struggling householders they sink gradually through all the phases of lodging-letting until they are reduced to the condition of being divided into tenements. Each room is then taken by a different family; the doorstep is seldom cleaned; the passage and stairs belong to everybody, and are looked after by nobody; the little yard becomes choked up with dust and filth; the inspector of nuisances is openly defied if he ever goes near the place, and the unfortunate street is doomed; it grows <pb id="p.55" n="55"> more black and more ragged every day; a yellow mist always seems to hang over it, through which its unsightly inhabitants may be dimly seen from the main thoroughfare into which it runs; ignorant policemen begin to look suspiciously upon it, and overrated <QUOTE>detectives</QUOTE> put it down as a harbour for thieves. It gets an ill-name, like an unlucky dog, and is hanged by all except the patient district visitors. 
<p>It is unnecessary for any writer to go over all the low streets of a particular district to give the public a faint picture of their chief characteristics, and he will do his duty if he carefully selects that representative thoroughfare which seems to him to present most of the features he wishes to depict. Such a representative hole and corner I believe I have found in Star Street, in the Christ Church division of St. George's in the East, a locality of <num value="43">forty-three</num> acres, with a population of <num value="13300">13,300</num>, untiringly watched over by the Rev. G. H. M&lsquo;Gill. 
<p>Star Street is a narrow avenue, leading out of the Commercial Road towards the river, the <pb id="p.56" n="56"> entrance to which is half blocked up with fruitstalls crossing-sweepers, and loiterers. Unlike most of its neighbours, it hangs out every sign of overcrowding for the most careless or hurried passer-by to look at, and it contains, perhaps, within an equal area, more hard-working, would-be-honest strugglers for dear life than any similar street in the same district. Its road is black and muddy, half filled with small pools of inky water, in which stand a number of trucks and barrows belonging to the poorest class of costermongers. The end is nearly blocked up with a public-house, which seems to thrive in the very citadel of want. At some of the low dirty doors wet baskets are standing half full of a common fish called <QUOTE>dabs;</QUOTE> in some of the wretched parlour windows, under sickly yellow curtains, a few rotten oranges are displayed on an old shutter for sale; another miserable front parlour seems to have been scooped out so as to form something like a shop, in which a few coals are thrown down in <num value="1">one</num> corner as a sign of trade; another parlour has been turned into a cat's-meat store, <pb id="p.57" n="57"> and there is <num value="1">one</num> of those small chandler's-shops where nearly everything is sold, and <QUOTE>weekly payments</QUOTE> are taken, which invariably flourish in such neighbourhoods. 
<p>I went down this thoroughfare with the chief clergyman of the district, and we were immediately surrounded by poor, thin women, in scanty dresses, representing every variety of dirt and poverty. They have nothing to pawn, nothing to take to the marine-store dealers. Their husbands can get no work for the present at the docks,<NOTE><datestruct VALUE="1861-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> and they can get little or no needlework from the cheap clothiers in the neighbourhood. Their standard of living is so low that a few days of compulsory idleness brings them to the brink of starvation. <num value="1">One</num> has a story to tell of fever and sickness, another of bread refused by the poor-law authorities on some technicality, another begs to be visited without delay, and a dozen others present letters of recommendation for relief from the funds at the disposal of the clergyman. The same <pb id="p.58" n="58"> question seems always to bring the same melancholy answer:-- 
<p> <QUOTE>How many children have you?</QUOTE> 
<p> <QUOTE><num value="8">Eight</num>, sir.</QUOTE>

<p> <QUOTE>Come to me, at the parsonage, at <num value="3">three</num>.</QUOTE> 
<p>We go into some of the houses to inspect the misery. The ground floor of <num value="1">one</num> is occupied by a sweep. A short broom sticks out over the door. The front parlour contains <num value="2">two</num> women, half covered with soot. A bed, as black as the women, stands in <num value="1">one</num> corner, in which an infant is sleeping, with its little face looking pale, even under the dirt, and its head lying lower than its legs. <num value="2">Two</num> other young children are playing on the black floor in front of the little glowworm of a fire, eating what is literally bread and soot. <num value="6">Six</num> other children, belonging to the same parents, are playing somewhere about in the inky puddles; and even this family only <pb id="p.59" n="59"> represents half the population of the small house. The rooms may be <num value="10">ten</num> feet square-certainly not more<NOTE>Average height, <num value="8">eight</num> feet <num value="5">five</num> inches; length, <num value="9">nine</num> feet <num value="6">six</num> inches; width, <num value="9">nine</num> feet <num value="6">six</num> inches.</NOTE>--and the rent averages about <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> a room. The back parlour is also rented by the sweep, and it contains nothing but a mountain of soot--the store resulting from several weeks' work --an empty birdcage, and a fluttering green rag of a window-blind. Upstairs, in <num value="1">one</num> room, is a street hawker, with a wife and <num value="5">five</num> children, and in another room is a carpenter, also with a wife and <num value="5">five</num> children. The latter has the same old painful story to tell of no work and no pay. He is a strong, healthy man, nearly <num value="50">fifty</num> years of age, respectable in appearance, and civil in address. He is trying to still his evident hunger with a little weak tea, probably made from boiled tea-leaves, which his wife has begged from some family for whom she works. A few small lumps of precious bread are floating in the tea, and a hungry child is looking over the edge of the table at the remains of <pb id="p.60" n="60"> a small coarse loaf. Not a crumb is wasted of the scanty store; for the blank days of unproductive idleness may not be near their end, and the hateful workhouse must be kept at arm's length. The other children, if not in the ragged or national schools, are rolling anywhere about the streets, like all other children of the very poor, in every back alley of the town. When they are gathered together at night--if they ever are so gathered--the roof of this stunted dwelling will cover <num value="25">twenty-five</num> inmates. Other houses in the same poor street--not larger, not cleanershelter <num value="22">twenty-two</num> and <num value="21">twenty-one</num> inmates respectively; and <num value="13">thirteen</num> lodgers for <num value="1">one</num> house seems to be a very common number. <num value="2">Two</num> of the rooms have <num value="11">eleven</num> inmates, while <num value="1">one</num> particular room has <num value="9">nine</num>, and another room has <num value="9">nine</num> also. The general result seems to beaccord- ing to a local census taken by the Rev. Mr. M&lsquo;Gill, on <datestruct VALUE="1860-12-19"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=19>19</day>, <year reg=1860>1860</year></datestruct>-that in <num value="235">two hundred and thirty-five</num> small rooms there is, self-crammed, a growing, breeding population of <num value="344">three hundred and forty-four</num> adults and <num value="3">three</num> <pb id="p.61" n="61"> <num value="157">hundred and fifty-seven</num> children, making a total of <num value="71">seven hundred and one</num>. A few of these unfortunates have been struck off the list since this melancholy account was taken; some by exhaustion, or long-settled disease, brought to an end by want. <num value="1">One</num> labourer gave in, under a low fever, a few hours before we visited the street, and his dead body was stretched upon the only bed in the dark room, covered with a borrowed white sheet. Round the fire was a crowd of weeping women, and amongst them the widow, with <num value="2">two</num> of the dead man's moaning children stricken with the same fever. Wretched as these people were, they would struggle to bury the dead body without assistance from the parish, for there is nothing the poor have such a horror of as a pauper's funeral. No sooner have we left this abode of misery than we are almost dragged over to another, where a mere girl is suddenly left a widow with <num value="2">two</num> helpless infants. Her husband was a dock labourer, twice as old as herself, and he died of asthma. He hung about the docks in the keen weather, day after <pb id="p.62" n="62"> day, waiting for ships that never came, and the afternoon before he came home wet, miserable, and hungry, took to his scanty bed, and never left it again. Death is bitter enough at all times, and in all places, but it is a <num value="100">hundred</num>-fold more bitter where those who are left are haunted by the dreadful feeling that a few pence would have kept the body and soul together if they could only have been found. 
<p>There are other streets in this district, such as Devonshire Street and Hungerford Street in the immediate neighbourhood, which are as full of hunger, dirt, and social degradation as Star Street--my representative thoroughfare. They have all been in the same condition for years, and they show little prospect of material improvement. They contain no thieves, and no threepenny lodging-houses, and are tolerably free from houses of ill-fame. It is a curious social fact that when a particular street reaches a certain depth of poverty it becomes purified from its vice; for though thieves and prostitutes do not become converted in a period of scarcity, <pb id="p.63" n="63"> they invariably shift their quarters. The lower industrial occupations in the general locality I have been dealing with may be broadly classed as dock-work, needle-work, coal-whipping, and street hawking. The labouring population are independent and honest, and no alms are ever applied for at a period of full labour. The district is industriously <QUOTE>worked</QUOTE> by the clergy and their assistants. The ragged and national schools, some of them fitted up under railway arches, collect and educate about a <num value="1000">thousand</num> children of both sexes-boys, girls, and infants. These schools are supported by government to the extent of <measure value="290l." type=currency><num value="290">290</num>l.</measure> (I take the figures of <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>), by the pence of the children to the extent of <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure>, and by local subscriptions to the amount of <measure value="150l." type=currency><num value="150">150</num>l.</measure> more. A movement is on foot to enlarge and improve the old Middlesex Society's National Schools in Cannon Street Road, founded in <datestruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct>, which are far behind the pressing wants of the locality. There is a blanket-and-rug society, instituted for the purpose of giving (not lending) these necessaries to the poor, and every year <pb id="p.64" n="64"> <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4">fourth</num> of the stock distributed has to be renewed from fair wear and tear. Instances where this property has been pawned, even in periods of great want and suffering, are very rare. There is a small Dorcas society, which dispenses about <measure value="25l." type=currency><num value="25">25</num>l.</measure> a year, andwhich only stops here for want of funds. There is no public soup-kitchen, but the clergy distribute bread, coals, and grocery, as far as their means go; and the Rev. Mr. M&lsquo;Gill receives assistance every year from the Marquis of Westminster, for these and other parochial purposes, to the extent of <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure> 
<p>The clerical work seems very heavy, as in <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct> there were <num value="611">six hundred and eleven</num> baptisms, <num value="135">one hundred and thirty-five</num> marriages, and <num value="520">five hundred and twenty</num> churchings; and the visiting work, divided amongst <num value="21">twenty-one</num> local visitors, has reached <num value="453">four hundred and fifty-three</num> cases of poverty and sickness in <num value="1">one</num> day during <datestruct VALUE="1861-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>. It is proper to mention here that the incumbent is assisted in this part of his labours, by the Metropolitan District Visiting Association, with an annual donation of <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure> <pb id="p.65" n="65"> 
<p>Amongst all this charity and benevolent work there is <num value="1">one</num> healthy example of self-help in the Christ Church Penny Bank, the oldest institution of its kind in London. Its total receipts in <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct> were about <measure value="944l." type=currency><num value="944">944</num>l.</measure>, and its total repayments about <measure value="945l." type=currency><num value="945">945</num>l.</measure> It brought over a balance from the former year of about <measure value="388l." type=currency><num value="388">388</num>l.</measure>, and it begins the present year with a balance of about <measure value="387l." type=currency><num value="387">387</num>l.</measure> The detailed accounts for <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct> show that more money was paid in during the winter and autumn than during the spring and summer, and the heaviest withdrawal was made in December. 
<p>This is hardly the place to dwell upon certain notorious inequalities in the metropolitan poor-rates; but I cannot close this chapter without referring to the different assessments of the <num value="2">two</num> great docks in the quarter I have been dealing with. The London Dock Company, which usually employs about <num value="1500">one thousand five hundred</num> of the men who are now thrown upon the parish or upon chance relief, paid <measure value="19000l." type=currency><num value="19000">19,000</num>l.</measure> as its share of the poor-rate in <datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>; and the St. Katharine Dock Company, which usually employs about <pb id="p.66" n="66"> <num value="1000">one thousand</num> similar labourers, only paid <measure value="720l." type=currency><num value="720">720</num>l.</measure> in the same year. The <num value="2">two</num> properties are only divided by a lane which a man can almost leap over; but the <num value="1">first</num> has the misfortune to stand in part of Shadwell, St. George's, Wapping, and Aldgate, while the last has covered the whole of an extinct parish, and has pushed the poor upon its neighbour's shoulders. 
<p>The latest parochial statistics in St. George's in the East (for the week ending <datestruct VALUE="1861-01-19"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=19>19</day>, <year reg=1861>1861</year></datestruct>) show that the poor-law guardians relieved <num value="3720">3,720</num> out of an estimated population of <num value="60000">60,000</num>, and issued some <num value="600">600</num> summonses for the last quarter's rates. 
<p>The whole area of the parish is <num value="3">three</num> quarters of a mile long, by <num value="3">three</num> quarters of a mile broad. <pb id="p.67" n="67"> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="4" id="c.4"><HEAD>Behind Shoreditch.</HEAD>
 
<p>That vast district of eastern London familiar to the public under the broad title of Bethnal Green would exhaust a twelvemonth in a house-to-house visitation. It is flat, it is ancient, dirty, and degraded; its courts and alleys are almost countless, and overrunning with men, women, boys, dogs, cats, pigeons, and birds. Its children are ragged, sharp, weasel-like; brought up from the cradle--which is often an old box or an egg-chest--to hard living and habits of bodily activity. Its men are mainly poor dock labourers, poor costermongers, poorer silk-weavers, clinging hopelessly to a withering handicraft, the lowest kind of thieves, the most ill-disguised class of swell-mobsmen, with a sprinkling of box and toy makers, shoe-makers, and cheap <pb id="p.68" n="68"> cabinet-makers. Its women are mainly hawkers, sempstresses, the coarsest order of prostitutes, and aged stall-keepers, who often sit at the street corners in old sedan-chairs, and sometimes die, like sentinels, at their posts.<NOTE>Last Monday evening, <datestruct VALUE="1860-12-24"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=24>24</day>, <year reg=1860>1860</year></datestruct>, the deputy coroner for East Middlesex held an inquest at the <QUOTE>Marquis of Cornwallis</QUOTE> public-house, Curtain Road, Shoreditch, relative to the death of Agnes Edgell, aged <num value="73">seventy-three</num> years, who died from exposure to the weather. It appeared from the evidence that the deceased had kept an oyster-stall at the corner of Charles Street, Pitfield Street, and on Saturday night last she was seen sitting on a chair by her stall. When her daughter and a lodger called upon her and asked her if she wanted anything, she replied, <QUOTE>Yes, I am very cold.</QUOTE> The daughter went for some tea and bread and butter, but about half-past <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock the deceased suddenly became ill, and died in her chair before medical assistance could be got. The deceased had been in charge of the stall about <num value="30">thirty</num> years, and was a decent woman, much noticed by the neighbours for her cleanly and sober habits. Mr. John George Blackall, surgeon, of Pitfield Street, Hoxton, stated that the deceased was dead when he was called. Life had been extinct <num value="5">five</num> minutes, and he found her dead in a chair. He had made a <foreign lang=la>post-mortem</foreign> examination of the body, and found that the various organs were healthy and free from disease. The heart and lungs were congested, and the immediate cause of death was cold and exposure to the severity of the weather. On the night in question the deceased complained of the cold, and had once had some warm rum and water, although she was an abstemious woman. The jury returned a verdict that <pb n="p.69"> <QUOTE>The deceased died from congestion of the heart and lungs, brought on by exposure to the cold and inclemency of the weather while sitting at a public stall.</QUOTE> 
</NOTE> Its <pb id="p.69" n="69"> broadest highways are chiefly lined with the most humble shops. There are steaming eatinghouses, half filled with puddings as large as sofa squabs, and legs of beef, to boil down into a cheap and popular soup; birdcage vendors; mouldy, musty dens full of <num value="2">second</num>-hand garments, or gay <QUOTE>emporiums</QUOTE> in the ready-made clothing line; pawnbrokers, with narrow, yellow side entrances, whose walls are well marked with the traces of traffic; faded grocers; small print shops, selling periodicals, sweetstuff, and stale fruit; squeezed--up barbers, long factories and breweries, with the black arches of the Eastern Counties Railway running through the midst. Every street of any pretension is generally guarded at its entrances by public-houses smelling of tobacco, stale beer, and sawdust; and the corners of every leading thoroughfare cutting into the heart of the district are watched over by glittering genii in the shape of gin-palaces. <pb id="p.70" n="70"> Concerts, which consist chiefly of street <QUOTE>nigger</QUOTE> singing, held in dingy, long rooms, over the bars of the public-houses in the interior, form the chief amusement of the common inhabitants in their hours of plenty, occasionally varied by dog-fights, rat-matches, and the sport of drawing the badger. On Sundays the whole neighbourhood is like a fair. Dirty men, in their sooty shirt-sleeves, are on the housetops, peeping out of little rough wooden structures built on the roof to keep their pigeons in. They suck their short pipes, fly their fancy birds, whistle shrilly with their forefingers placed in their mouths, beat the sides of the wooden building with a long stick, like a fishing-rod, and use all their ingenuity to snare their neighbours' stray birds. Those they catch are not quite as Valuable as the products of the Philoperisteron Society, but they have a value, varying from tenpence to half-a-crown, and long usage has settled the amount of redemption money which will buy back <num value="1">one</num> of these captives. Down in some of the streets a regular exchange is held <pb id="p.71" n="71"> for the purpose of buying, selling, and comparing animals; and, as in Whitechapel and all such neighbourhoods, no difficulty is found in obtaining beer or spirits contrary to law, as long as the money to pay for it is forthcoming. 
<p>This enormous portion of London is divided into many small district parishes, each <num value="1">one</num> watched over by a very active clergyman. Amongst the principal workers are the Rev. Mr. Christie, the Rev. Mr. Gibson, and the Rev. James Trevitt. I have taken the lower portion of Bethnal Green (the district parish of St. Philip), which has been carefully worked by the latter excellent gentleman for more than <num value="9">nine</num> years, because it enables me to deal with certain social features common also to Shoreditch and Spitalfields. 
<p>I have known the neighbourhood I am describing for <num value="20">twenty</num> years, and, if anything, it seems to me to be getting dirtier and more miserable every year. Old houses, in some few places, have been taken away-simply because they fell to pieces; but the new houses erected within <pb id="p.72" n="72"> the last <num value="10">ten</num> years show little advance in the art of building dwellings for the poor. The whole present plan and arrangement of the district is against improvement, and the new structures sink to the level of the old. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> court I go into with my guide is called <QUOTE>Reform Square</QUOTE> &mdash; a bitter satire upon its aspect and condition. It is nearly opposite the Church of St. Philip, and is a square yard &mdash; not much larger than a full-sized dining-room. It is entered by a mountainous slope of muddy brick pathway, under an archway; and contains half-a-dozen houses, which look out upon <num value="2">two</num> dust-heaps, a pool of rain and sewage, mixed with rotten vegetable refuse, and a battered, lopsided public privy. The houses are like doll'shouses, except that they are black and yellow. The windows are everywhere stuffed with paper &mdash; rags being in too much demand at the marine store-shop, or for the clothing of the human child-rats, who are digging into the dust-heaps, with muddy oyster-shells. Every child must have its toys; and at the back of Shoreditch <pb id="p.73" n="73"> they play with rusty old saucepans, pieces of broken china, stones torn out of the roadway, or cinders that they search for laboriously. Very often the boys have to mind babies, while their mothers are out at work, and they sit about upon doorsteps with dirty brown limp bundles that never look like young children. 
<p>At the entrance to <QUOTE>Reform Square</QUOTE> is a row of zigzag <num value="2">two</num>-roomed houses, let for about <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> a week; the street-doors of which open into the lower rooms, almost upon the wretched tenants' beds. The staircases leading to the upper apartments are little more than ladders in <num value="1">one</num> corner, and there is no space for more than the usual furniture--a table, <num value="2">two</num> chairs, and a bedstead. The flooring of the lower rooms in these houses is so high above the pavement in the street, that <num value="3">three</num> stones are placed at each of the street-doors for the inhabitants to climb into their dwellings by. I say climb, for the lower stone is so lofty, and the whole <num value="3">three</num> are so shallow on their flat surfaces, that it is with difficulty a full-sized <pb id="p.74" n="74"> man can stride up them. When you stand in the narrow doorway, and look down into the street, it is like looking down into a deep pit. The comfort in the inside of these dwellings is about equal to the conveniences outside. The <num value="1">one</num> we went into smelt so close and musty from overcrowding, neglect, and, perhaps, <num value="40">forty</num> years' dirt, that it almost made me sneeze. It was occupied by a sallow-faced woman, who called herself a <QUOTE>gipsy,</QUOTE> and who gets her living amongst servants and others as a fortune-teller. 
<p>In another house of greater height, with a close, black, uneven staircase, almost perpendicular, we found a mixed population of about <num value="50">fifty</num> people. In <num value="1">one</num> room was a labourer's wife and several children, yellow, eager, and very ragged; in another was a woman with a blighted eye; in another a girl making match-boxes, assisted by a boy, while her father, a hawker of bootlaces, crouched despondingly over the grate, groaning about the badness of trade, and her mother was busy about the room. The dirt in this apartment was the landlord's dirt, not the <pb id="p.75" n="75"> tenant's--a most important distinction. The walls were chipped and greasy--the <num value="1">one</num> cupboard was like a chimney; but the few plates were clean and neatly arranged--clean, perhaps, for want of being used. The floor had been well scrubbed and sanded, the mantelshelf was set out with a few poor china ornaments, and there were a few pictures stuck up which had been cut out of an illustrated newspaper. <num value="1">One</num> was a fancy portrait of Lord Brougham. This room was admittedly occupied by this family and another woman--a stranger--from necessity, not from choice. At the top of the house was a weaver's work-room, lighted by <num value="2">two</num> long windows with diamond panes. It contained <num value="2">two</num> idle shuttles, watched over by a sickly woman, almost sinking with anxiety, if not from want. The husband was out seeking work in the silk market, like hundreds of fellow-labourers, with little prospect of obtaining it. A change in fashion, and the inevitable operation of the French Treaty, have affected Spitalfields and Bethnal Green in the same way as Coventry, and a <pb id="p.76" n="76"> large mass of trained industry finds itself suddenly <QUOTE>displaced.</QUOTE> It is not easy in middle life, with energies kept down by low living, little recreation, and bad air, to turn the mind and fingers into a fresh trade. The best of us are not always equal to such a task, and a poor weaver's wife may naturally sit on the edge of her scanty bed, and look into the future with little hope. 
<p>The statistics of silk-weaving show a melancholy decline. In <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct> there were <num value="25000">25,000</num> looms in and about Spitalfields, now there are only <num value="8000">8,000</num>. In <datestruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct> wages were lower by <num value="30">thirty</num> per cent. than in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, and they did not average more than <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure value="9s." type=currency><num value="9">nine</num> shillings</measure> a week. Now they cannot be higher than <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">seven</num> shillings</measure>, or <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">seven</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence a week, on an average; and there are only from <num value="25">twenty-five</num> to <num value="30">thirty</num> master weavers. Perhaps, <num value="20000">20,000</num> working weavers are now struggling against this decay of their handicraft, and many of them, in despair, are taking to street hawking. The Rev. Mr. Trevitt has set up many of these skilled labourers in this rough calling, with a capital of a few <pb id="p.77" n="77"> shillings. Mr. Corkran, the excellent missionary connected with the London Domestic Mission, who knows more, perhaps, of the misery in Spitalfields proper, than most men, gives a very sad account of the poor in his district. I do not quote his admirable reports, because they deal with a period earlier than what I am dealing with.<NOTE><datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct> inclusive. <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct> is not yet published.</NOTE>
 
<p>I entered another street, not far from the <num value="1">one</num> I have been speaking of, to witness more misery and more pain. There is nothing exceptional or transient in the conditions of life I am endeavouring faintly to describe. In Whitechapel, in St. George's in the East, and in Bethnal Green, the people have lived for nearly a quarter of a century as they are living now. Strike off a few cases of obvious imposition--of pardonable exaggeration on the part of Scripture readers--and make a little allowance for the late severe weather-and we shall find the social condition of nearly <num value="1">one</num>-half of London to be nearly as low and degraded as that of Ireland in its worst days. Here is a <pb id="p.78" n="78"> representative street of houses--leading off from the road in which stands St. Philip's Church--the windows in the lower rooms of which are actually on the ground. These lower rooms are wells, dark and unventilated; and overcrowding, with all its attendant evils, can hardly be avoided in such a place. Just now we saw a row of houses where you had to climb up into the lower rooms; here you have to dive down into them. The <num value="1">first</num> house we enter at random contains a suffering family. A large-headed, gaunt girl, tall and speechless, with arms like thin sticks, sits motionless in a chair. It scarcely requires a <num value="2">second</num> glance at this poor creature to tell that she is an idiot. A man sits shivering by the fire--old-looking though not aged. He is a sawyer by trade. We ask after his health, and his wife, who struggles to speak cheerfully, answers for him: 
<p> <QUOTE>He went out, sir, to work, <num value="1">one</num> morning early, without food, and the cold seems to have struck on his chest.</QUOTE> 
<p>The man tries to tell us that he has never <pb id="p.79" n="79"> been warm since, but the words seem to hiss in his throat. I have spoken to scores of people who have nearly lost their voices from asthma and other diseases of the chest; and I have seen many poor deaf and dumb creatures who could only show their misery by their looks. <num value="1">One</num> youth--a young coal-whipper, with scanty and uncertain work--was maintaining a father and mother who both suffered under this terrible affliction. The most melancholy sight, however, is to watch the blind when they hear that the visiting clergyman is in the street or court. They creep out of dark holes of doorways, feeling their road carefully, and throw out their arms widely as if to embrace the expected loaf. 
<p>Christopher Street, with its continuations, is a fair sample of an ordinary Bethnal Green street, and though short, it contains many varieties of low and humble life. In <num value="1">one</num> <num value="2">two</num>-roomed house is a notorious dog-trainer, who has lived there for many years, and who keeps a dog-pit for the gratification of his patrons. His yard is often crammed with every kind of terrier and fighting <pb id="p.80" n="80"> dog, and his upper room, where the pit is built, is reached by a ladder passing through a trapdoor. When you enter this room, the ladder can be drawn up and the trap-door shut down, and so far you are secure from interruption. The windows are boarded up behind the blinds, so that no noise within can reach the little street; and when a sufficient number of patrons are gathered together to pay the spirited proprietor of this den, the delights of Hockley-in-the-Hole are partially revived. Dogs are set together by the throat, cats are worried and killed by bullterriers within a certain time, to show the training of the dog, and rats are hunted round the pit for the same purpose. 
<p>Within a few doors of this illegal sporting theatre is a family who have just been rescued from the lowest depths of wretchedness. They were found, a few days ago,<NOTE><datestruct VALUE="1861-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> without food, without fire, or any other necessary, in a room nearly bare, their furniture having been seized for rent. There were a father, mother, and several children <pb id="p.81" n="81"> standing shivering within the bare walls, the children having nothing on them but sacks tied round their waists. 
<p>In Old Nichols Street, a turning in this district leading off from Shoreditch, we have a specimen of an east-end thieves' street. Its road is rotten with mud and water; its houses are black and repulsive; and at least <num value="50">fifty</num> dark sinister faces look at you from behind blinds and dirty curtains as you pass up the rugged pavement. 
<p>Courts of the filthiest description branch off on either side, filled with the usual dust-heaps, the usual pools of inky water, and the usual groups of children rolling in the dirt. There is a silence about the street and its houses indicative of the character of the place. The few trades that are carried on are in most cases merely masks--industry is the exception, robbery is the rule. A few hawkers, who have eaten up their <QUOTE>stock money,</QUOTE> or capital, and have even pawned their baskets at the baker's for a loaf of bread, are to be found in some of the holes and corners, but the dark public-house with the green blinds is <pb id="p.82" n="82"> full of thieves, the houses on either side are full of thieves and prostitutes, and a tavern in a side street is full of swell-mobsmen. Even here, as in all these places, there is something to admire. A woman, who works at box-clump-making, with her husband, has picked an orphan boy from the streets, and given him a place amongst her own children. His father was a porter at <num value="1">one</num> of the markets, and died suddenly in the midst of his work. The boy was tossed about for many days, fighting hard for food, until he found a home with people who were nearly as poor as himself. Many cases of such self-sacrifice, such large-hearted generosity, may be easily found amongst the poor. The cases of heroic endurance under the most frightful trials are even more frequent, and they make us respect these poor creatures even in their dirt and rags. 
<p>The Rev. Mr. Trevitt is unceasing in his labours within his own district, and he has called round him an efficient staff of assistants. He has about <num value="40">forty</num> visitors who watch over the poor, and he draws about <measure value="80l." type=currency><num value="80">80</num>l.</measure> per annum from the <pb id="p.83" n="83"> Metropolitan District Visiting Society. He has <num value="2">two</num> ragged schools, which collect about <num value="700">seven hundred</num> children; <num value="2">two</num> national schools, which collect about <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> more; and an infant school, which gather about <num value="100">one hundred</num> infants. His Sunday schools are attended by about <num value="800">eight hundred</num> children, who have to work during the week, and his evening schools are generally attended by about <num value="80">eighty</num> of the same class. 
<p>There is no public soup-kitchen, but the usual miscellaneous distribution at the parsonage, according to means. Mr. Trevitt looks sharply after the many hungry children in his district, and often has a soup-dinner for these alone. A few days ago a thin, sickly man came to the parsonage door, and asked to be admitted amongst the children. He was told that this was against the rules, and he went away in tears. He was called back before he had crawled out of the street; he crept in, like a poor dog, and was seated with the little ones. His case was inquired into, and it turned out that he was <num value="1">one</num> of the most wretched of that very wretched class, an hospital <pb id="p.84" n="84"> <QUOTE>incurable.</QUOTE> He had been turned out by the doctors a few weeks before, had been tossed about the streets unable to work, and was dying from starvation. His case may be only <num value="1">one</num> out of thousands.  <NOTE><p>The following is another <QUOTE>incurable</QUOTE> case, from the same neighbourhood, bearing date <datestruct VALUE="1861-01-20"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=20>20</day>, <year reg=1861>1861</year></datestruct>:-- 
<p> <QUOTE>Inspector Armstrong, of the H division of police, mentioned to Mr. Leigh, the sitting magistrate at the Worship Street police court, the following pitiable case of distress, to which his attention had been called, and which he had himself visited. The inspector said that on entering the top room of a house situate in Thomas Street, Brick Lane, Spitalfields, he found a man and woman lying in what might with due allowance be termed a bed; covering or blanket there was none. The rooms were nearly bare. The inmates were evidently very ill, and they looked much older than they really were. They were man and wife; Copeland by name. The man was formerly a cabinet-maker. His mother was present, and doing all she could to comfort them. From her the inspector learned that they were both in a consumption, the husband having been turned out of the London Hospital a fortnight since as incurable, after a <num value="7">seven</num> weeks' attendance there. The inspector added that the wretched couple were incessantly obliged to be raised to a sitting position, in consequence of inability to breathe otherwise. The mother of Copeland was called for by Mr. Leigh, and vouched for the truth of her miserable relative's condition. A fortnight since a son of Inspector Constable, H division, in pity for the sufferings he witnessed, gave them <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> Mr. Leigh, for present aid, ordered that <num value="2">two</num> blankets and <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> should be instantly sent them.</QUOTE> </NOTE>
 <pb id="p.85" n="85"> 
<p>There is a maternity society in the St. Philip's district, to lend necessaries for child-birth, and an excellent industrial school (built and presented to the district by Mr. Edward Thornton, at a cost of <measure value="3000l." type=currency><num value="3000">3,000</num>l.</measure>), where girls and women are taught needlework. The penny bank, in <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, showed receipts to the amount of <measure value="900l." type=currency><num value="900">900</num>l.</measure>, and this is the poorest of the Bethnal Green parishes. 
<p>The other side of Shoreditch--the Finsbury side --is quite as full of black courts and alleys as Bethnal Green. Walk along the main thoroughfare from the parish church towards the city, peep on <num value="1">one</num> side of the hay-bundle standing at the corn-chandler's door; look through the group of rough, idle loungers, leaning against the corner of the gin-shop, or dive under the fluttering garments that hang across outside the cheap clothiers window, and you will see a dark, damp opening in the wall, like the channel of a sewer passing under and between the houses, and leading to <num value="1">one</num> of the wretched courts and alleys. You enter the passage, picking your way to the bottom, and find a little square of low, black <pb id="p.86" n="86"> houses, that look as if they were built as a penal settlement for dwarfs. The roofs are depressed, the doors are narrow, the windows are pinched up, and the whole square can almost be touched on each side by a full-grown man. At the further end you will observe a tap, enclosed in a wooden frame, that supplies the water for the whole court, with a dust-bin and privy, which are openly used by all. In the middle of the little sooty square, standing in the puddles always formed by the sinking stones, you will see <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> barrows belonging to street vendors, and you will gather from this that some of the stallkeepers you have noticed in the thoroughfare outside retire to these dark hiding-places when their labour is done. Glancing over the tattered green curtain at <num value="1">one</num> of the black windows, you will see a room like a gloomy well, and in its depths perhaps a knotted old woman crouching over a small glow-worm of coal, gleaming in a grate full of dust; or the frowning face of some idle male inhabitant of the court, whose expression somehow reminds you of the felon's dock. If you <pb id="p.87" n="87"> pass to the right or left, you may find other ovenlike entrances leading to other similar courts; or you may go out into the main thoroughfare, and, seeing a similar passage a few yards farther on, you may explore it, to find yourself in another twin huddling-place of the poor. The plan and design of this <num value="2">second</num> court will be in all respects the same as those of the <num value="1">first</num>, showing that the same master-mind has created them both. Who the owners of this class of property are may remain a mystery; they draw their rents in short, sharp payments, and they have no reason to complain of the unprofitable character of their investments. These settlements, of which there may be <num value="50">fifty</num> scattered at the backs of the houses on each side of Shoreditch, within the space of half a mile, were all built <num value="30">thirty</num>, <num value="40">forty</num>, <num value="60">sixty</num>, and even <num value="80">eighty</num> years ago, when building regulations were not so strict as they are now; and they were nearly all framed to meet that desire of the English people to have a <QUOTE>house to themselves.</QUOTE> The value of house property in these holes and corners of Shoreditch must be rising rather than <pb id="p.88" n="88"> falling. An ordinary room, in <num value="1">one</num> of these courts, will fetch <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> a week, and an ordinary house, which contains little more than <num value="1">one</num> room covered with a loft, will fetch <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> a week. In some cases these courts are choked up with every variety of filth; their approaches wind round by the worst kind of slaughter-houses; they lie in the midst of rank stables and offensive trades; they are crowded with pigs, with fowls, and with dogs; they are strewn with oyster-shells and fish refuse; they look upon foul yards and soaking heaps of stale vegetable refuse; their drainage lies in pools wherever it may be thrown; the rooms of their wretched dwellings have not been repaired or whitewashed for years; they are often smothered with smoke, which beats down upon them from some neighbouring factory, whose chimney is beyond the control of the Act of Parliament; ragwarehouses have their close store-rooms looking them full in the face; and cats'-meat preparers boil their cauldrons amongst them without fear. In most cases the inhabitants, as we might fully <pb id="p.89" n="89"> expect, are not superior to their surroundings, and in places like Bowl Court, Plough Yard, which contains a half-Irish colony, they form the greatest nuisance of all. An Irish landlord or landlady will rent a room at about <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> a week, and then take in as many families, or individuals, at a small nightly rental, as the floor can possibly hold. This is openly done in defiance of the Lodging-house Act, or any other social reform law. 
<p>Red Lion Court, near the Shoreditch corner of the Kingsland Road, is another bad specimen of these alleys, being overcrowded with men and their families engaged in the watercress trade. Pierce's Court, New Inn Yard, Shoreditch, is another of the worst; and the whole line of Holywell Lane, on either side, is full of these holes and corners. 
<p>Each <num value="1">one</num> has got its story to tell, like more ambitious thoroughfares, and here is a narrative of a Shoreditch Court, told in the words of the Reporters:-- <QUOTE>A middle-aged, poor-looking woman, who stated her name to be Sarah Wilkinson, <pb id="p.90" n="90"> and who was accompanied by a pale-faced little girl, dressed in black, said to be <num value="11">eleven</num> years old, but who seemed about <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num>, applied at the beginning of <datestruct VALUE="1860-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, to Mr. Leigh, the sitting magistrate at the Worship Street police court, for advice, with the following strange statement:--Mrs. Wilkinson said that the object of her application to the magistrate was to learn what she was to do with the little girl she had with her, who had neither home nor food, and was utterly friendless. The child's name was Eliza Clarke, and she was the daughter of an engineer of the same name, who formerly worked for Mr. Ramsay, in the same business, near Shoreditch Church, but who abandoned the girl's mother about <num value="7">seven</num> years ago, to go to Australia, and had never since been heard of. About <num value="2">two</num> years ago the mother was taken into custody, and brought to this court, charged with selling spirits without a licence, as she believed, and on her being committed for that offence her child was taken into Shoreditch Workhouse, and remained there as long as the mother's term of <pb id="p.91" n="91"> imprisonment lasted, for as soon as the mother was liberated she instantly went to the workhouse, and claimed and took away her daughter. The mother and child had since lived in a court called Mark's Place, Leonard Street, Shoreditch, in <num value="1">one</num> of the houses of which she had a small ready-furnished room, which she held up to the morning of the previous Monday week, when she went out, as usual, leaving the little girl at home, and had never again been seen from that time to this. Inquiries had been made about her, but she could not be traced anywhere, and she (the applicant) and all the neighbours felt quite sure that something must have occurred to the woman, as she was such a good and affectionate mother she would be certain to come back to her child if she could. They were all poor people down that court, and, as the mother did not come back, and it was unsafe to leave so young a girl in charge of the room, which was wanted for some <num value="1">one</num> else, the landlady had accordingly resumed possession of her room and goods, and then the child had no place <pb id="p.92" n="92"> to go to. All the neighbours liked the mother, and pitied the child, and they had all given her something to eat and drink by turns; but they had too many incumbrances of their own for any <num value="1">one</num> to take her in and lodge her; and the little girl had consequently been sleeping about anywhere she could, and on Monday slept all night upon the stairs of <num value="1">one</num> of the houses. She (Mrs. Wilkinson) was a widow, and had been so <num value="3">three</num> years, and had <num value="3">three</num> little children to keep. She had only <num value="1">one</num> room herself, and could not possibly take the child in. Besides, she was only a charwoman, and that occupation was so uncertain that she could hardly keep herself and family. She did not live in Mark's Place, but a short distance off; and on going there that morning to see about some work, she met the little girl, sopped through with rain, and in such a pitiable state that, knowing how fond her mother was of her, she could not bear it, and determined to go at once with her to Shoreditch workhouse, and induce them to admit the girl till something was heard of the mother. <pb id="p.93" n="93"> She accordingly took the child there, and some person seated at a desk told her she must see Mr. Cole. Who Mr. Cole was she did not know, nor whether she did see Mr. Cole, but a thin gentleman inquired her business, and she explained to him the forlorn state of the little girl, and told him everything that she had now told the magistrate. Instead of admitting the child, however, the gentleman did not even take down her name or address, but told the witness she had no business to interfere, and as she had interfered so much, she had better look after her herself, which, as she had already explained, she could not do. On receiving this refusal, she told the gentleman that she must take the little girl before a magistrate, and he replied that she might do so if she liked. She then walked out of the house, leaving the child behind her, thinking that they might perhaps keep her, as she was there, but in a minute or so afterwards the girl was turned out into the street, although a shower of rain was coming down at the time. She had now, therefore, brought the child to <pb id="p.94" n="94"> the magistrate, to know what was to be done with her, as it was enough to make any heart ache to see a child in such a state as this was. Mr. Leigh said it was certainly a strange story the woman had told. The child seemed to him to have been wholly deserted, and if the applicant had really told the workhouse authorities all that she had told him, and she said she had, it did seem surprising that they should see a child like this, with no food, no mother, and no place to go to, and yet refuse to take her in. He thought some explanation would be given of it, and the warrant officer of that district must take the woman and child to the house, state the particulars, and inquire why they did not admit her.--Mr. Edwards, of the Shoreditch Board of Guardians, and Mr. Cole, relieving officer, waited upon Mr. Leigh to explain that part of the above case with which they are connected. Mr. Cole stated that the woman did attend with the child, and made the application referred to. She said she was a widow with <num value="3">three</num> children of her own, and that she could not keep the child, and <pb id="p.95" n="95"> although he told her that she would be compensated by the parish for her trouble, and any expense she might incur by tending it while the inquiry was made, she refused to have anything more to do with it, and took the child away with her without further parley, and expressed her determination to take her before a magistrate. The officer said that if she was resolved upon doing that he could not help it, and the woman went out with the child, and did not leave it behind her at the house, as she stated, nor was it, as she also said, thrust out into the street. Mr. Edwards said that every anxiety was felt by the guardians to attend to all cases of this kind, as far as possible, and he could confidently appeal to the warrant officer whether immediate attention was not paid to any recommendation or order of the magistrates, whether verbal or written. The child had been admitted the same night without hesitation, and when he stated that they had an ancillary establishment at Brentwood, now full of children, many of whom had been cruelly deserted by their parents, <pb id="p.96" n="96"> with the object of getting them there, it was obvious that some previous inquiry was imperative, and Mr. Cole had been appointed as an extra overseer for that especial purpose. Some further observations of a similar tenor followed, and ultimately Mr. Leigh expressed himself satisfied with the explanation now given, and thanked the gentlemen for their waiting upon him to afford it.</QUOTE> 
<p>Some of the alleys, which are sometimes called <QUOTE>rents,</QUOTE> sometimes <QUOTE>rows,</QUOTE> sometimes <QUOTE>gardens,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>places,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>buildings,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>lanes,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>yards,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>squares,</QUOTE> and sometimes <QUOTE>walks,</QUOTE> ---situated near Mark's Place, on the other side of the Curtain Road, down Holywell Mount-still maintain a little of a certain rural aspect which they must have had in full bloom when they were <num value="1">first</num> built and occupied. Their houses are not larger, but they have each a piece of ground in front, which, though it grows nothing, to all appearance, but broken, uneven railings, serves to ventilate the place, and keep the opposite dwellings at a proper distance. In other alleys, even in the thickest <pb id="p.97" n="97"> part of Shoreditch, there is, here and there, a desire shown to be clean; and I may mention <num value="1">one</num> little, ill-constructed court in Holywell Lane, which is quite a flower in the wilderness. Its entrance is low and gloomy, but the rugged stones on its footway are carefully swept, and the uneven steps leading down to its little row of houses are white with hearthstone. The <num value="1">first</num> dwelling--a small room with a staircase like a ladder, leading up into the top loft (the plan upon which nearly all the small houses in these courts appear to be built)-has nothing about it to account for its luxurious look, and yet it seems to be a palace compared with its neighbours. Its owner is an humble working man, with <num value="1">one</num> child, and an cleanly, decent wife, and all the magic that struck me, or that would strike any <num value="1">one</num> who took the trouble to pay it a visit, was produced by nothing more wonderful than a little soap and water. <pb id="p.98" n="98"> <pb id="p.99" n="99">

<p>The Church, as an institution, has more authority in poor than in rich neighbourhoods; and, as a building, it shines by the meanness lying at its feet. We are never tired of looking up a narrow avenue of fruit-stalls and old-clothes shops when the prospect closes with spires and a Gothic porch. The lower and more irregular the houses that cluster under the shadow of the <pb id="p.102" n="102"> temple the more charming is the picture. The blue smoke curls upwards from the red housetops, the sunlight touches the corners of the crumbled cathedral stone, and the solemn gray towers seem to watch over all as they stand amidst the low white clouds. Writers like Longfellow, coming from the raw new cities of America, that were only yesterday reclaimed from the jungle, looking upon such scenes, are lost in admiration of the broken outlines and irregular lines, and the slums become invested with the purple hues of poetry. 
<p>Unfortunately, however, there is a period in the history of slums when they become utterly mouldy and putrid. I say unfortunately, for most of us like old houses and old neighbourhoods, and Victoria Street, W., will not please the present generation like old Westminster. The mouldy, putrid period fell upon the old Abbey district some few years ago, and an improved thoroughfare was ploughed through to Pimlico. The diseased heart was divided in half-<num value="1">one</num> part was pushed on <num value="1">one</num> side, and the <pb id="p.103" n="103"> other part on the other, and the world was asked to look upon a new reformation. A great city, a leprous district, is not to be purified in this manner by a Diet of contractors; and the chief result has been to cause more huddling together.<NOTE>The Bishop of London spoke as follows in the House of Lords, <datestruct VALUE="1861-02-28"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1861>1861</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>Their lordships were perhaps in the habit of thinking that the East-end of London was inhabited almost solely by the poor; but he believed that they would find that nearer to their own doors there was more squalid misery than in the East-end. In the very neighbourhood where they then were the clergyman who was entrusted with the spiritual charge of the parish of St. John had informed him that evening that when Victoria Street was constructed <num value="5000">five thousand</num> poor persons were displaced in his parish, <num value="3">three</num>-fourths of whom went into the already overcrowded parishes on the other side of the river, whilst the other <num value="4">fourth</num> found refuge in his own parish; so that in many instances, where a family had a house before, there were now <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> families in it.</QUOTE> </NOTE>
While the nightmare street of unlet palaces was waiting for more capital to fill its yawning gulf, and a few more residents to warm its hollow chambers into life, the landlords of the slums were raising their rents; and thieves, prostitutes, labourers, and working women were packed in a smaller compass. The mouldiness and putridity <pb id="p.104" n="104"> of Westminster--the part popularly so called--have gone on increasing, and of all the criminal districts in London I think it is now the worst. 
<p>It matters little on which side of Victoria Street you turn, if you wish to find examples of social degradation. The streets and alleys that may be marked with a black cross, even in the <num value="5">five</num> districts of St. John, St. Mary, St. Stephen, St. Mathew, and Holy Trinity, are nearly <num value="70">seventy</num>, and there are others scattered about the neighbourhood. The courts here are the worst kind of courts, both in structure and condition; and the streets present lamentable blocks of overcrowding. In Carpenter Street, which is a working-man's street, nearly every room contains a different family of <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> members, and the rents run about <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> and <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings</measure> a week for each room. At <num value="1">one</num> of the houses I went into an empty kitchen which had recently contained a mother and <num value="3">three</num> children, the roof of which was not more than <num value="5">five</num> feet <num value="10">ten</num> inches from the floor, and the window of which was not a yard deep. In another street, <pb id="p.105" n="105"> called Grub Street, the houses were even more faded, dilapidated, and overcrowded; and a place called York Buildings presented some of the worst features of an east-end sweeps' court. The dirt in the latter place, both in and outside the houses, was like a thick cement; and the rents for <num value="2">two</num> dark dustholes of rooms was nominally <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> a week. A lazy-looking man, who was smoking out of an upper window down the court, remarked <QUOTE>that they never paid more than <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence on the average, because they were often out of work.</QUOTE> The energy of some of these men in seeking employment is not very great, and a bricklayer's labourer is never so happy as when he is standing against the archway of his court, with his hands in his pockets, and his eyes looking vacantly into space. On Sunday morning, in places like the <num value="7">Seven</num> Dials, Whitechapel, Somers Town, Marylebone, the New Cut, Lambeth, or the Broadway, Westminster, you may always see a <num value="100">hundred</num> of these men gathered in silent groups, smoking, but seldom talking to each other. <pb id="p.106" n="106"> 
<p>A court, recently rebuilt, called Champion's Alley, may be taken as a model of its class. The rooms are small, and the dimensions of the passage in front are not greater than those of many other similar passages, but each house is ventilated at the back, and is complete in itself. A dwelling of <num value="2">two</num> rooms in a court like this seems to satisfy the most ambitious workman. The landlords in this neighbourhood, with a few exceptions, apologize for the wretched condition in which they let and maintain their property, by saying that they dare not fit up a cistern or an outbuilding with anything that would sell for sixpence at the marine store-shop. There may be some truth in this assertion, though it is an obvious excuse for neglecting the tenants. 
<p>Tripp's Buildings is an example of a court whose inhabitants struggle to be clean and decent, even in the face of bad building arrangements. The houses have no outlet, no air-hole at the back, and are, therefore, unhealthy and illegal. They have each <num value="2">two</num> rooms, <num value="1">one</num> over the other, the size of which may be about <num value="7">seven</num> feet broad <pb id="p.107" n="107"> and <num value="12">twelve</num> feet long. Each house lets for about <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> a week. 
<p>The gas-works in this neighbourhood are sure to attract a certain number of labourers, and these labourers are sure to live as near as possible to the factory. Laundry Yard, a long, narrow strip of pavement, covered with every kind of filth, contains a row of dwarfed <num value="2">two</num>-roomed huts, filled with Irish labourers and their families, and closely faced by the high wall of the Chartered Gas Company's premises. It is no uncommon thing to find eighteen people, of both sexes and of all ages, in <num value="1">one</num> of these miserable dwellings. The rooms are dark on the finest day, and the small outlet at the back is nearly full when it contains a dog's house and a pail. The male inhabitants are chiefly Irish, and are mostly engaged at the gasworks. 
<p>If some of these places are dirty, repulsive, and overcrowded, they are all brightness and purity compared to other parts of the colony. Enter a narrow street called St. Anne's Lane, glance up at a fearful side-court called St. Anne's Place, <pb id="p.108" n="108"> and wonder whether such filth and squalor can ever be exceeded. I went up the last-mentioned court, which had every feature of a sewer, and found a long puddle of sewage soaking in the hollow centre. The passages of the low black huts on either side were like old sooty chimneys, and the inhabitants were buried out of sight in the gloom. As I turned round to leave this place I caught a glimpse of several rough, long-haired heads peeping round the edges of the entrance. They disappeared immediately, like figures in a Punch and Judy show. 
<p>I crossed over the road, and entered the openly acknowledged high street of thieves and prostitutes. It is called Pye Street, and has no mock modesty about it--no desire to conceal its real character. Threepenny <QUOTE>homes for travellers</QUOTE> abound on both sides-yellow, sickly, unwholesome places, many of them far below the level of the road, and entered by a kind of pit. Many of the houses have no flooring on their passages; and there is nothing for the barefooted children to stand upon but the black, damp, uneven earth. <pb id="p.109" n="109"> A child, dirty and nearly naked, was hanging out of <num value="1">one</num> of the old-fashioned casement windows; and in the summer time it is no unusual thing to see about <num value="50">fifty</num> coarse women exhibiting themselves in the same manner. The yards at the back of the houses contain little mountains of ashes and vegetable refuse; and a dustcon- tractor's yard, in the centre of the street, seems to have burst its bounds, and to have nearly poured out its oyster-shells, cabbage-stalks, and broken china into the open thoroughfare. Shorthaired young men, with showy handkerchiefs round their neck, and tight corduroy trousers, were standing at most of the doors, looking pretty sharply about them from under the peaks of their caps. A fiddler was playing a dancing tune to a mixed assembly of thieves and prostitutes, and a morning ball was being arranged on both sides of the pavement. Many of the side streets and courts about here are shored up with black beams to keep the houses from falling, which adds to their wretched appearance. A few ragged and other schools have been planted in this district in <pb id="p.110" n="110"> some of those faded shops which were formerly the haunts of receivers of stolen property. 
<p>The hilly playgrounds for this hopeful colony lie on both sides of Victoria Street, down by the arches of the roadway. Where the links of new buildings have not yet joined each other you can see fag-ends of courts or interiors of ruined houses lopped, like diseased limbs, but not sewn up and healed. Sometimes the filth of these places runs out in black streams, and winds its way slowly down under the road arches. The interiors as seen from the highway, are much like what we have been looking at in the last few chapters, and any <num value="1">one</num> who walks leisurely along this bread thoroughfare may observe the kind of life that is boiling within the settlement. 
<p>The melancholy row of shops in Orchard Street will remind many of the old days of Field Lane. There is the dismal chandlers shop, with wood, tobacco, and coals mixed up with sooty lard, stale saveloys, a dry knuckle of boiled pork, and a few balls of cotton; a mysterious shop, that may be a lodging-house, or an unlicensed <pb id="p.111" n="111"> beershop; and the low pawnbrokers, with the brown, greasy door, and the many-coloured pockethand- kerchiefs hanging in strings from a hook. In Snow's Rents, in this neighbourhood, you may see a specimen of a very dirty costermonger's colony, with a stream of thick black water and vegetable refuse flowing down the centre of the passage. In King's-head Buildings, in the Broadway, you may see the filthiest court in Westminster. The narrow roadway up it is worse than a sewer, because there is no flow of water; and amongst its swarm of inhabitants are several sweeps. It was near here that I saw the only instance of intoxication that I met with during my journeys, and I mention the fact for what it is worth. A drunken sweep and bricklayer were supporting each other as well as they were able, and exchanging what appeared to be vows of lasting friendship. 
<p>The old Almonry, as it was called, near the spot where Caxton's house is said to have stood, and the art of printing to have been <num value="1">first</num> pursued, is now nothing but the dreariest of ruins. A low <pb id="p.112" n="112"> passage leads out of Tothill Street into the hollow shell of a house, whose rooms seem to have sunk into a few heaps of rotten bricks. Dead dogs, soaking fragments of old placards, and other refuse, lie amongst the bricks and dust, and the space is watched by closed, battered houses, with black, jagged window-panes. In a murky room of <num value="1">one</num> of these houses a few tattered garments were drying; but this was the only sign of life to be seen within the place. <pb id="p.113" n="113"> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="6" id="c.6"><HEAD>Near Regent Street.</HEAD>
 
<p>The evils of overcrowding in courts and alleys are, unhappily, not confined to the eastern end of the metropolis. There are almost as many dark holes and corners within a few yards of Regent Street or Charing Cross, which shelter almost as much sickness, crime, and poverty, as any back hiding-places in Whitechapel or Bethnal Green. We may have all hurried for years along the bright open highways, scarcely glancing at the little doorways scattered here and there between the busy shops, and yet these doorways--holes--call them by what name we will--are the entrances to many thousands of closely-packed homes. These human dwellings --human in little else but the old familiar house shape--in old central neighbourhoods, like St. <pb id="p.114" n="114"> James's, Westminster, form square openings, reaching up to the little patch of heaven overhead, like the shaft of a mine. The air in them is close and heavy, and they are dark on the clearest day. The infants and mothers suffer because they cannot escape from them; the elder children, as soon as they are able to run, desert them from instinct, and find more comfort in the gutters and streets; and the men leave them to seek for warmth and cheerfulness in the neighbouring tavern. They are penal settlements, not homes, and those who visit them and consider the effect they must have on mind and morals are compelled to wonder that there is not far more vice and drunkenness in the world. 
<p>The poverty and low living of London have to be largely dug out. The noisy crowds who clamour at police-courts--who jam against workhouse-doors, like visitors to a theatre--who are foremost at soup-kitchens, and other similar charitable distributions-contain very few of the patient, hard-working poor. These sit in their wretched rooms, looking into each other's faces, <pb id="p.115" n="115"> drooping over bare shopboards, bare benches, bare tables, and half-empty grates, hoping and praying for work. They only ask to be employed. They tramp through miles of mud--they stand for hours in work-room passages--they bear rain, and cold, and hunger without murmuring, and they clear their little households of every saleable article rather than beg. When they have got their little strip of cloth, or leather, to stitch or cut into shape, they clasp it like some precious treasure, and hurry home to begin their ill-paid task. In times of plenty they are, perhaps, a little wasteful; they look a very short way into the future; but we must think of their education and habits, and their cheerless lives. It is easy to add up their little excursions, their few dissipations, and fewer amusements, and to bring a wholesale charge of improvidence against them when they drop dead from want; but how few would bear the trial of living where they live and come out of it prudent, thoughtful, and pure! 
<p>The great central neighbourhood of St. James's, <pb id="p.116" n="116"> Westminster, which is a fair sample of many adjacent districts, such as Soho, part of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, &amp;c., is chiefly occupied in its Berwick Street district by working tailors, porters, and shoemakers. Nearly every street has got its history in London handbooks, and is famed for having sheltered some celebrity in literature, science, or art. Now, however, the mansions fashionable in the last century are let off in <QUOTE>tenements.</QUOTE> Every room is crowded with a different family, and <num value="4">four</num>, if not more, landlords are interested in the rent. The leases are invariably sub-let, <num value="3">three</num> deep, and the active inspector of nuisances, Mr. J. H. Morgan, has more than enough to do. Dwellings that originally sheltered <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> persons are now crowded with <num value="30">thirty</num>, <num value="40">forty</num>, or <num value="50">fifty</num> inmates. The carved wainscotings are torn to pieces, or covered, an inch deep, with black grease. The old banisters are broken down. The stairs are rugged, dark, and uneven, but fortunately broad, according to the original plan of the buildings. Garrets are as much crowded as ground-floors. <pb id="p.117" n="117"> and even more, because some of these groundfloors have been turned into common shops, and <num value="1">one</num> of the worst features of the district is a tendency to live in kitchens and cellars. <num value="9">Nine</num> of these kitchens, wholly unfit for human habitation, were condemned last year, chiefly in Windmill Street, Haymarket; Pulteney Street, and Francis Street. In some cases they are lighted by a small window, looking out into a shallow area half full of stones, oyster-shells, and dust; and in other cases they are lighted by nothing but a small gridiron grating. In each of these damp, dreary, underground prisons were self-confined a large family, consisting of <num value="4">four</num>, <num value="8">eight</num>, or even <num value="10">ten</num> persons, and the average rental paid for each room was about <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings</measure> a week. Hundreds of these kitchens are still so occupied, although the district has been weeded of the very worst; and some of the condemned apartments are turned into carpenters' workshops, others into dustholes and receptacles for filth. Looking down more than <num value="1">one</num> of these repulsive places, I saw <pb id="p.118" n="118"> a shelving heap of dust, broken bricks, eggshells, and vegetable refuse. Here it was that the cholera spent its chief fury in <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>; and though every house then felt the weight of that affliction in <num value="1">one</num> or other of its rooms, and the gutters ran with chloride of lime for many weeks, the same crowding and dirty habits still prevail. The dirt arises partly from long-settled carelessness about domestic cleanliness, partly from the impossibility of keeping <num value="1">one</num> room tidy when <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> people have to eat and sleep in it, and partly from the neglect of landlords to whitewash, paint, and paper the dwellings. The crowding arises from the desire of the working population to be <QUOTE>near their bread,</QUOTE> as they express it; and the high rental of the tenements, averaging <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> a room per week, arises naturally from this rush upon a particular spot. An empty room is a novelty. The distribution of population is not equal, even in the same parish, because the rents are unequal. About <num value="134">one hundred and thirty-four</num> persons live on an acre in the St. James's Square <pb id="p.119" n="119"> division, about <num value="262">two hundred and sixty-two</num> on an acre in the Golden Square division, and <num value="432">four hundred and thirty-two</num> on an acre in the Berwick Street division, the neighbourhood I am dealing with. 
<p>I went into <num value="1">one</num> of the houses in Pulteney Court --within a stone's throw of Regent Street--and was struck by its resemblance to <num value="1">one</num> of the lowest dwellings of Bethnal Green. The small yard seemed rotting with damp and dirt. The narrow window of the lower back room was too caked with mud to be seen through, and the kitchen was <num value="1">one</num> of those black-holes, filled with untold filth and rubbish, which the inspector had condemned a twelvemonth before. The stench throughout the house, although the front and back doors were wide open, was almost sickening; and when a room-door was opened this stench came out in gusts. In <num value="1">one</num> apartment I found a family of <num value="6">six</num> persons, flanked by another apartment containing <num value="5">five</num>. <num value="1">One</num> room was a little better furnished than another, but the gloom of poverty, dirt, and foul air hung over all. A <pb id="p.120" n="120"> turn--up bedstead, dirty and broken, a small cracked table, a couple of rickety chairs, a piece of soap lying on the table by the side of a greasy knife, a pail full of soaking rags, and a knot of sooty infants in a corner, seemed to be the usual contents of a room. <num value="1">One</num> thin, sharp-faced boy was minding <num value="1">one</num> of these apartments for the tenants, while they (both husband and wife) were out seeking work. I asked him if he lived there: <QUOTE>No, sir,</QUOTE> he said; <QUOTE>my house is higher up.</QUOTE> He led the way to <num value="1">one</num> of the garrets, where there were more signs of misery still, and this he told us was his <QUOTE>house.</QUOTE> The dead cinders had oozed out of the grate into the room; an empty saucepan stood on the table by the side of a piece of soap, a cracked tea-cup was on the floor; an old collapsed bedstead, covered with something like a ragged mat, stood in <num value="1">one</num> corner; and the dismal aspect of the place was heightened by <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> flower-pots full of black earth and dry, sapless sticks. The boy's mother was a poor shirtmaker, deserted by her husband, and left, fortunately, with only this <num value="1">one</num> child. In the <pb id="p.121" n="121"> next garret were a shoemaker and his family, a wife and <num value="3">three</num> children. The room was tidy, and even comfortable, though the work-bench under the window was idle. The rent of this apartment was <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings</measure> a week, although the low roof had been broken in in half-a-dozen places by the snow. The man, upon being questioned why he lived in such a hole at such a rent, with the ceiling scarcely higher than his head, spoke about his long residence in the parish, his familiarity with its people and its ways, and his dread of going into another neighbourhood, which he said would be like a <QUOTE>foreign country</QUOTE> to him. This dislike of going amongst strangers is the feeling which often keeps up rents, and often keeps the working population huddled together, and poor. In another room was a consumptive tailor, working on a shop-board under the window, faced by his wife, who was also employed in the same trade. <num value="1">One</num> child was playing between them on the board, another on the floor, and <num value="5">five</num> more were in the street. The man was almost bent double with disease and <pb id="p.122" n="122"> long stooping; and, bad as he was, he was only like hundreds of his class. Seen dimly through the garret windows opposite were many more similar workers, and many garrets in the neighbourhood contain half-a-dozen yellow, crooked workmen, stitching themselves into their graves as they sit cross-legged on the floor. This man was an out-door patient of the Brompton Hospital, and he held out his letter of recommendation in his long, thin hand The hand, the voice, the hollow chest were quite sufficient credentials of disease, without any written attestation. His employment, like that of most of the tailors in this district, comes chiefly from the West-End houses, and he has to live in the neighbourhood to be within reach of his masters. He was working painfully on some tough piece of army cloth. 
<p>In another small street, called New Street, remarkable for its condemned kitchens, was a little broker's shop, which looked miserably bare of stock. An old bedstead and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> small articles stood at the door, but the interior was <pb id="p.123" n="123"> empty. The room at the back of the shop, where the owner and his wife lived, with <num value="7">seven</num> children, was also nearly empty, for the bedstead at the door was almost the last of their own domestic furniture. The man was a Frenchpolisher out of work, and bit by bit his little home had been broken to pieces and sold to passers-by. It was suggested that an application to the parish was a proper thing under the circumstances, but the wife proudly declined to ask for such charity, saying they were well known in the neighbourhood, and after poor-law relief they would never be able to hold up their heads. This is a very common feeling, especially amongst poor ratepayers. 
<p>The most singular hole and corner in the district is No. <num value="6">6</num>, Husband Street. It is a small yard containing a dustbin, a water-tank, a couple of lower rooms or cellars, that look like condemned cells, and a number of rooms with black wooden exteriors, reached by ladders, and supplied with rude balconies. The population of each room on each flat can look over into the yard <pb id="p.124" n="124"> from these balconies, which help, in some degree, to ventilate the place. Each room is crowded with a distinct family, having many children; and <num value="1">one</num> room contains a mother-in-law in addition to the usual family. In <num value="1">one</num> of the small garrets is an old charwoman, living by herself, who is going into the infirmary in a few days; and in the other garret is a widow with <num value="3">three</num> children, who supports herself as a tailoress. Her few goods were seized for rent at her last lodgings, and she was left without a single article of furniture, except a few rags for a bed. The children were squatting on the bare boards, and she was standing up stitching a piece of scarlet cloth at the window. <num value="1">One</num> advantage of living <QUOTE>in tenements,</QUOTE> as it is called, is that the poor come together and help each other, or their lot would often be harder than it is. The miserable lodger who has no fire can often run up or down and sit with the <num value="1">one</num> who is more comfortably situated; and many a hungry mouth is filled, or naked form partly clothed, by those who have little more than a few crumbs to share. <pb id="p.125" n="125"> 
<p>The sanitary work of this neighbourhood is perhaps heavier than that of most districts, except the Strand district; certainly far heavier, taking equal areas. The inspector of nuisances is that rare workman, a man whose heart is in his work, and the poor regard him as a friend and adviser. Besides nuisances arising from overcrowding in ordinary dwellings, or courts and alleys, he has to deal with many troublesome animals. The district contains nearly <num value="400">four hundred</num> stables, in which are kept more than <num value="1000">one thousand</num> horses. Over these stables are a number of small close rooms, in which about <num value="900">nine hundred</num> people reside and bring up their families, or onefortieth part of the whole population of the parish. Another nuisance arises from cows, of which there are at least <num value="200">two hundred</num> kept at <num value="8">eight</num> stations in as many streets. I went into <num value="1">one</num> liquorice-coloured den, where <num value="39">thirty-nine</num> of these animals were standing with their faces against the wall, being milked. There was no light except a glimmer from <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> murky windows in the roof, and the whole place was ankle-deep <pb id="p.126" n="126"> in slush. Whether the milk supplied to the neighbourhood from this dark stable is an invigorating fluid or not, I leave the able officer of health, Dr. Lankester, to determine; and, I believe, in his reports, he has spoken against the system and its product more than once. Slaughterhouses, belonging to small, struggling butchers, in the closest part of the neighbourhood, form another sanitary difficulty, which is only got over by incessant inspection. Something like <num value="1200">one thousand two hundred</num> distinct nuisances found, and <num value="1600">one thousand six hundred</num> abated during the year, represent a very low social condition for a small West-End district. <pb id="p.129" n="129"> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="7" id="c.7"><HEAD>Near King's Cross.</HEAD>
 
<p>Some of our most densely populated, faded parishes--like some of our most degraded streets--are known by names that mock their present condition. Paradise Row, Mount Pleasant, Angel Place, and similar titles are commonly attached to some of the rottenest courts in London; and <num value="2">two</num> of the central parishes-St. Martin's, at Charing Cross, and St. Giles's, at Upper Holborn--are only legally known as standing <QUOTE>in the fields.</QUOTE> The latter parish, at <num value="1">one</num> time the most notorious, if not the worst, in London, has been partly purified at the expense of other portions of the town, and we may now ask very fairly where we can find St. Giles's-in-the-Fields. Without assuming that the courts off Drury Lane, the dark, close avenues of Endell Street, and the <pb id="p.130" n="130"> dismal maze of the <num value="7">Seven</num> Dials, are half cleared of their human rats; without shutting our eyes to the troublesome fact that Lambeth, Marylebone, Whitechapel, and St. George's in the East have become more crowded with refuse population that certain improvements in Bloomsbury and thereabouts might be carried out, we may conclude that the real St. Giles's-in-the-Fields stands exactly where it has stood for nearly <num value="20">twenty</num> years --at Agar Town, in the noisy parish of St. Pancras. You may reach it in a walk of half-an-hour from the centre of Clerkenwell, and find it nestling, as snugly as ever, by the side of the Great Northern Railway. 
<p>The origin of a very few London eyesores may be traced to a landlord-and-tenant quarrel, and Agar Town apologizes for its present degraded existence by a local tradition. The ground belongs to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners--the whole property belongs to them now--and many years ago it was let to a gentleman on a certain lease, most probably for farming land. Some <num value="5">five</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num> years before the expiration of this <pb id="p.131" n="131"> lease he applied for a long extension, expecting no doubt to profit by the advance of railways on the metropolis. His application was refused by the commissioners, and upon this he resolved to make the most of his remainder, and annoy his landlords. The necessary steps were taken, the proper people were called together, and Agar Town--the lowest effort of building skill and arrangement in or near London--arose upon Church property. 
<p>It is exactly <num value="10">ten</num> years since I last went over this unsightly settlement, and I found upon visiting it again that more than <num value="1">one</num> half of its habitations (it contains about <num value="500">five hundred</num>) are hopelessly decayed, while its roads and footways are improved. In <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>--the historical year of civilizing exhibitions--it had gasworks, but no gas; for what lighting material was made upon the spot was despatched to more solvent and favoured neighbourhoods. Its highways were ditches--deep and filled with mud--and its footways were mere earthbanks on each side of the channel. Now, thanks to the efforts of the parochial <pb id="p.132" n="132"> authorities, and in defiance of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, who could never be brought to any sense of their public duty, although they have repurchased the property, Agar Town possesses lamps and pavements. Still, for all this, it forms a melancholy social picture--a sample of St. Giles's really in the fields--a collection of the very lowest order of labourers' cottages. There is no occasion to hunt all over the country for samples of overcrowding, dirt, discomfort, and even vice in rural dwellings--here is a Dorsetshire under our very walls, almost within a mile of Temple Bar. 
<p>The inhabitants of the lower part of this district are chiefly poor labourers and the poorest class of costermongers, or men, as they are called, <QUOTE>who follow the markets.</QUOTE> The women, if not laundresses, of which there are a great number, are nothing at all, and a <QUOTE>mother's society</QUOTE> strives hard to teach them the commonest home duties. It is doubtful if they know how to cook the simplest eatable, or wash a child; and the public soup-kitchen finds full employment in making up for their domestic shortcomings. In the upper <pb id="p.133" n="133"> portion of the town, near the railway, the inhabitants are of a higher class--hard-working mechanics and railway men. Their houses are houses, not hovels, and not unlike those at Wolverton, Crewe, or any other railway settlement. Much soup is given away, under the superintendence of the local clergyman, the Rev. R. P. Cleminger, and his assistants; but the place is largely used as a cheap eating-house, where men and woman come or send to get their dinners. The soup is generally sold at a price which leaves <num value="1">one</num>-half of the cost to be defrayed by voluntary contributions. When the inhabitants are ill, they can send to this benevolent cook-shop, and get a pint of beef-tea for threepence, a pint of mutton broth for the same money; a basin of gruel for <num value="1">one</num> penny; a basin of arrowroot for threepence: a jug of barley-water for twopence; a jug of lemonade for sixpence; a ration of corn-flower blancmange for sixpence; a sago pudding for the same money; and a tapioca pudding or a ground rice pudding at the same charge. This institution was started by Miss Margaret Howitt, and <pb id="p.134" n="134"> though it is excellently managed, and reflects great credit upon its originator, it shows the utter helplessness of the low resident population. 
<p>Agar Town, by those who knew it best, has long been regarded as the stepping-stone to or from the workhouse. People use it as a sleeping-place, within the meaning of the act, to entitle them to poor-law relief in St. Pancras, or they go from it direct into that stately pauper palace which looks down proudly upon this withered portion of the parish. When they are sent from the union--even other unions besides the local <num value="1">one</num>--they make Agar Town their <num value="1">first</num> residence, while they wait for something to turn up. They must have some hole or corner to go to, as the law will not allow them to huddle together in the gutters, and an open settlement where friends may be found, or where no questions will be asked, is what they naturally look for. <num value="1">One</num> half the houses are cottages or huts, standing in black yards that grow nothing but splintered tubs and palings. There are seldom any apartments but what are upon the ground floor. In <pb id="p.135" n="135"> some rooms there are no doors, in others no windows; in others the garden walls, moist, soft, like wet gingerbread, have fallen down from very rottenness. The water-pumps in some places have long since been destroyed, and the water is kept in a hole. Dust-bins are unknown in that portion of the old town named Cambridge Crescent, and the usual public privies are another rarity. The tiles of the huts are broken off; the interiors represent the lowest condition of poverty and filth; the yards often contain clothes-lines, on which a few wet sole-skins, used by brewers, are drying for sale; the children are barefooted and ragged; the women seem to know no better way of closing a hole in a dirty garment than with a pin or a bit of string; donkeys roam about the place as clean and as well housed as their masters; and under the broken flooring you can often see the rough uncovered earth. The whole population of this district may be <num value="6000">six thousand</num> or <num value="7000">seven thousand</num>, and the rents vary from <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure> and sixpence to <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings</measure> a week for a room. Of course in this, <pb id="p.136" n="136"> as in all the neighbourhoods I have been visiting, the apparent high rents must be taken to include rates, taxes, drawbacks, irregularities, losses, and cost of collection. 
<p>The huts in Agar Town were built of old rubbish, on a <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years' lease. Some of the builders still live in them, happy and contented, dreading the time--about <datestruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>--when their term will expire. They are always ready to rally round the place, and to call it a <QUOTE>pretty little town.</QUOTE> The landlady of <num value="1">one</num>, who was chief architect, builder, and assistant to her husband in raising some of these hovels, was burrowing in a kind of dog kennel at the side of her tenants--living, in fact, upon her property. Her maxim was, <QUOTE>Live and let live,</QUOTE> and she avoided the crime of being an absentee. In most of these squat places families of <num value="5">five</num>, <num value="6">six</num>, <num value="10">ten</num>, and <num value="12">twelve</num>, were found, leading a swinish life in <num value="1">one</num> room, even when they rented another. In <num value="1">one</num> cottage was a young girl with an illegitimate child still living with her parents. In the road we spoke to a girl who had been turned out of doors by <pb id="p.137" n="137"> her father and stepmother, and had been found sleeping in privies. To do the miserable inhabitants justice, they are never backward in helping their own class, and here, as in similar places, they share what little they have. They are partial to dogs; probably breeding them for sale; and, at <num value="1">one</num> time, there was scarcely a hut without <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> of these animals. Their answer always is that <QUOTE>A dog keeps itself.</QUOTE> No known thieves or prostitutes are found in the neighbourhood--its lowest part is too poor and miserable for that; and what vices it has arise largely from dirt, and overcrowding. Intemperance is <num value="1">one</num> of these, and the clergy and others try to check it--as the Rev. Mr. Maguire does in Clerkenwell-by a temperance society connected with the church and schools. An old inhabitant, who holds property in the district, and keeps <num value="1">one</num> of those comfortable chandlers' shops--which, as I said in a former chapter, always thrive in such places--thought Agar Town would be a delightful settlement <QUOTE>if it wasn't for the drink.</QUOTE> The public-houses in this and the <pb id="p.138" n="138"> surrounding neighbourhood are certainly very numerous, and they endeavour to attract custom by pleasing signs. <num value="1">One</num> calls itself <QUOTE>The Good Samaritan,</QUOTE> standing near the canal, and is largely frequented by coal-heavers from the wharves and dustmen from a neighbouring contractor's. Some of the huts run down to this canal with sloping yards, ornamented with a few laths put together in the shape of an arbour. The better class of houses form part of many short streets, in which <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="4">four</num> roomed dwellings are built, and let to <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> families. Some of the railway men and decent mechanics inhabit these, and some are occupied by the wives of sailors. <num value="1">One</num> attempt to build a superior kind of dwelling, on a <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> years' lease, at the extreme end of the town, has been stopped by the purchase of much of the property by the Midland Railway Company. The inhabitants have <num value="1">one</num> advantage not often enjoyed by persons in low districts, their air is remarkably pure. Though some of the roads and most passages between the huts, are still rivers of mud, and <pb id="p.139" n="139"> receive the slops thrown into them from each ill-regulated household; and though the dwellings are low, the spaces between them are very open, and St. Giles's evidently gathers health by being a little way out of town. 
<p>The efforts of the Rev. R. P. Cleminger, during the last <num value="10">ten</num> years, to improve this wretched district, as far as his means and powers go, have been crowned with considerable success. Starting with a temporary church he has gathered round him a maternity society; a national school, with a <num value="100">hundred</num> scholars; a mother's society, before alluded to; a Sunday school, with <num value="370">three hundred and seventy</num> scholars; and a penny bank, whose depositors in <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct> numbered <num value="600">six hundred</num>, and the amount deposited <measure value="250l." type=currency><num value="250">250</num>l.</measure> There is a girls' school and infant school held for the present in the rooms of <num value="2">two</num> of the small houses, and a day nursery, where children are taken care of while their parents are at work. An institution of this kind in such neighbourhoods saves many infants from being burnt to death, or from many serious accidents. The schools are liberally supported <pb id="p.140" n="140"> by Miss Agar. There is a district visiting society, a soup-kitchen (before mentioned), a Church missionary society, a Bible society, a working man's institute, and a lending library, but the latter has not been much drawn upon by the adults of the district. There is a clothing fund in connection with the Sunday school, and <num value="1">one</num> of the scholars, a little girl, was asked a few days ago if she would like to have a pair of socks. <QUOTE>I'm very well off for socks,</QUOTE> she said, <QUOTE>and should like something else.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>How many pairs have you got?</QUOTE> inquired the teacher. <QUOTE>This pair on my feet,</QUOTE> said the child, astonished at the question. 
<p>The district employs <num value="2">two</num> ministers, a Scripture reader, and a Bible woman, and the church and charities draw much of their support from the Agar family, Camden Town, and Highgate Rise. 
<p>The whole of Somers Town--the adjacent district at the back of the New Road, near King's Cross--is a worthy neighbour of Agar Town.<NOTE><p>On Tuesday <datestruct VALUE="1861-01-29"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=29>29</day>, <year reg=1861>1861</year></datestruct>, a scene presented itself in the Bloomsbury County Court, Portland Road, that has <pb n="p.141"> never, since these courts came into operation, been witnessed before. The plaintiff, Mr. John Hewitt, son of <num value="1">one</num> of the officers of the above court, who carries on an extensive business as a tallyman and draper, in Pratt Street, Camden Town, had summonsed no less than <num value="153">one hundred and fifty-three</num> defendants, for sums varying in amount from <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> to <measure value="2l." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>l.</measure> and upwards. This vast number of summonses issued at <num value="1">one</num> plaintiff's suit caused the court to appoint a special day for the hearing. The defendants were summonsed at the respective hours of <num value="10">ten</num>, <num value="11">eleven</num>, and <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock, and shortly after <num value="10">ten</num> the court was crowded with debtors of various grades. No <num value="1">one</num> who witnessed the scene can fail regret that the system of tally-dealing, which affords such easy access for credit to an improvident wife or gay woman, cannot receive some wholesome check to save a working man's home from desolation. Many of the defendants were residents of Agar Town, St. Pancras and its vicinity, a place fertile with filth and rags, and inhabited only by the humblest of labouring men. The court sat till the whole of the cases were disposed of, and gave judgments at <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure>, <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>s.</measure>, and <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure> per month, according to the means the parties had for payment. 
<p>On Thursday the court again presented a like scene. <num value="1">One</num> tallyman, named Goodwin, of King's Cross, having <num value="43">forty-three</num> on the list, and Clements, of Judge Street, Euston Road, <num value="26">twenty-six</num>, making a total of <num value="69">sixty-nine</num>, averaging more than <num value="2">two</num>-thirds of the causes to be tried this day. 
</NOTE>
 <pb id="p.141" n="141"> It is filled with courts and alleys; it puts forward a gin-palace built in the true <num value="7">Seven</num> Dials' style, even to a clock in the wall near the roof; and is crowded with cheap china-shops, cheap clothiers, and cheap haberdashers. Its side streets have a smoky, worn-out appearance; the gas-lamps <pb id="p.142" n="142"> project jauntily from the walls, the iron posts at the end lean towards each other as if for mutual support; every street door is open; no house is without patched windows; and every passage is full of children. Back views of dingy publichouses make the scene more dismal; and wherever there is a butcher's shop it contrives to look like a cat's-meat warehouse. Chapel Street is the chief centre of business, and Sunday morning is its most busy period. It is very much like Shoreditch or Tottenham Court Road on a Saturday night, or the streets at the back of Clare market. There is a popular notion in the neighbourhood that things are sold a little cheaper on a Sunday morning, and many of the shopkeepers encourage this idea. The stall-keepers who crowd in the gutters with fish-stalls, vegetable-stalls, and hardware-stalls, are mostly residents of Agar Town; and when they have done their business for the day they go home to their huts like merchants to their villas. <pb id="p.143" n="143"> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="8" id="c.8"><HEAD>Marylebone and the Outskirts.</HEAD>
 
<p>If large factories and centres of industry invariably attract a crowded, dependent population, terraces and squares of private mansions do the same. From Belgravia to Bloomsbury--from St. Pancras to Bayswater--there is hardly a settlement of leading residences that has not its particular colony of ill-housed poor hanging on to its skirts. Behind the mansion there is generally a stable, and near the stable there is generally a maze of close streets, containing a small greengrocer's, a small dairy, a quiet coachman's publichouse, and a number of houses let out in tenements. These houses shelter a large number of painters, bricklayers, carpenters, and similar labourers, with their families, and many laundresses, and charwomen. Each room, with a few exceptions, is the home of a different family, and <pb id="p.144" n="144"> the kitchens are often more crowded than any other parts of the house. This is particularly the case in old and faded neighbourhoods--as I stated in my chapter upon St. James's, Westminster &mdash; and it is also the case in Marylebone, near the Regent's Park. Squares and terraces that are scarcely <num value="30">thirty</num> years old are still surrounded by hopelessly faded streets--some of them builders' mistakes, and others designedly built for the class who now occupy them. They all bear a melancholy family likeness to each other. Their street doors are always open; a few trucks are generally standing in the gutter; a marine storedealer's coloured placard sticks out prominently from <num value="1">one</num> of the houses; and a flock of chickens are always strutting in the road. They often contain more uncomplaining poverty than some of the courts and alleys I have just been describing, or may be going to describe. Many of their inhabitants cherish a spirit of independence which a long course of intrusive visiting charity has not been able to crush. 
<p>In the district of St. Paul's, Marylebone--a <pb id="p.145" n="145"> neighbourhood lying to the right of Lisson Grove, as you enter from the New Road--there are many streets that answer to this description. Byron Street, Brand Street, Bridport Street, are all filled with houses let out in tenements, each room fetching a rental of <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings</measure> or <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence a week, and containing a large family. Externally the <num value="2">two</num> latter streets look like what are called <QUOTE>genteel thoroughfares.</QUOTE> Several families will be gathered under <num value="1">one</num> roof; most of these families will have <num value="6">six</num> members of both sexes--some grown to the age of youth--and each house will thus contain a dense population of poor working people in a very small space. Many of these poor lodgers, when periodically pressed, will sell everything saleable, even to their clothes, rather than ask for a sixpence from the local charities. The Rev. Mr. Keeling, who watches over the district, assures me that <num value="1">one</num> half of his parishioners-or about <num value="5000">five thousand</num> people--have nearly all their garments in pawn at the present moment.<NOTE><datestruct VALUE="1861-01-"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> Many <pb id="p.146" n="146"> have told the visiting clergyman that a year's constant work, with the greatest thrift on their part, will hardly raise them out of the distress into which they have fallen. 
<p>Boston Place is an example of a lower class of settlement, lying half-way between the position of a court and a street. The houses exhibit every stage of squalor and wretchedness: the rooms are let at about <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> or <num value="2">two</num> and sixpence a week; the huddling together is even more extreme and unwholesome, and the place is a harbour for a few thieves and prostitutes. A common mews let out to cabmen-very often a decayed collection of private or livery stables--is a very usual feature in such neighbourhoods as this; and Huntsworth Mews, in this district, is a fair sample of these places. The yard and stables are dirty and neglected, the stablehelps are brown with filth, and over each stable is a low, close room, containing a family more or less numerous. The stable population in this district numbers about <num value="100">one hundred</num> families. <pb id="p.147" n="147"> 
<p>This is the side of Lisson Grove which is supposed to contain the decent poor; and on the other side, in the streets leading into the Edgeware Road, is a more densely crowded and even lower population. Bell Street, now famous in history as the spot where Turkish baths were <num value="1">first</num> established, is the main stream of a low colony, with many tributary channels. There is no particular manufacture in the neighbourhood to call the population together; a great number are not dependent upon St. John's Wood or the Regent's Park for a living; and they come together simply because they like the houses, the rents, the inhabitants, and the general tone of living in the settlement. Somers Town, Shoreditch, and the New Cut, Lambeth, are here repeated in their principal features, and the whole place looks like a flourishing branch of some great central bank of costermongers, dingy brokers' shops, and Irish labourers. The Irish have a marvellous power of lowering the standard of comfort and cleanliness in any court, street, or colony in which they appear; and certain <pb id="p.148" n="148"> sewerlike alleys near the Islington turnpike, certain back streets in the neighbourhood of Manchester Square--not to go <QUOTE>over the water,</QUOTE> or to the east of London--are exactly like certain <QUOTE>gardens</QUOTE> or places in this part of Marylebone. Some of these <QUOTE>gardens</QUOTE> --Smith's Gardens for example--contain dwarfed cottages, very battered and dirty, standing in black yards, and are the evident remains of Marylebone as a village. In such places you will generally find a sweep or a dustman, and the bit of ground in front of each hut is more convenient to receive saleable refuse than a kitchen or a back parlour. Some of the streets (I may mention George Street) are notorious haunts of thieves, prostitutes, and the lowest threepenny lodging-houses; and in this case, the blot upon the district is not made more foul by being the property of a parish officer. Rate collectors, registrars, and active vestrymen are too often the proprietors of these places, making an extra profit by their local knowledge. Sometimes the land such pest-houses stand upon is Crown or Church property, and <pb id="p.149" n="149"> the rent, and more, has to be expended in the work of counteracting their influence! There are no courts and alleys in this neighbourhood such as disgrace the east of London. The avenues are so broad that they may be almost classed as streets; the roadways are paved; there is no open drain trickling down the centre, and none that I saw were disfigured with public privies. The entrances, in <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> cases, were low archways, with pathways covered with various kinds of filth, but the interiors were open and fairly ventilated. I should prefer living in a hut in Smith's Gardens to living in a kitchen or back parlour in the St. Paul's district. 
<p>The Christ Church division of Marylebone, in which Bell Street and all its ramifications stand, is watched over by the Rev. Llewellyn Davies. The whole population of this crowded district is estimated at <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num>, and it embraces the worst part of the parish. The parochial work in such an area, which contains at least <num value="16000">sixteen thousand</num> idle and industrious poor, is necessarily <pb id="p.150" n="150"> very heavy, and, on the whole, it appears to be conducted sensibly and energetically. The principle of self-help--the only principle that tends to assist the poor without demoralizing them--is adopted in every practicable way; and the pure charities are numerous and well conducted. There are <num value="4">four</num> classes of schools for boys, girls, and infants, where a small weekly payment is exacted; there is a special Sunday school for children not attending the day schools; there are free evening classes in connection with the Sunday school, and similar classes at another school for lads, men, and girls. A working party is held weekly to which mothers of families may bring work, and at which they will receive friendly advice and assistance as to household management. No healthy educational agency is neglected. Amongst the self-supporting institutions is a provident fund, which numbered <num value="1250">one thousand two hundred and fifty</num> depositors of small sums in <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, and an amount deposited of <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> No money paid into this fund is returned in any form except in tickets for necessaries. There is <pb id="p.151" n="151"> also a benefit club coming under this head, where members are entitled to receive certain payments during illness. Amongst the charities is a relief fund, the chief objects of which are to lend blankets, money (in small sums not exceeding <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>l.</measure>, without interest), to make allowances to the sick, and to supply linen and other comforts to women lying-in. The number of in-door poor at the Marylebone Workhouse (<datestruct value="0-01-18"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=18>18</day></datestruct>), amounting to <num value="2039">two thousand and thirty-nine</num>, would people a small town; whilst there are <num value="3332">three thousand three hundred and thirty-two</num> <QUOTE>on the books</QUOTE> receiving out-door relief; and, in addition to these numbers, <num value="2851">two thousand eight hundred and fifty-one</num> have had casual relief during the last week. The cost of the relief of the poor during the year has been <measure value="53500l." type=currency><num value="53500">53,500</num>l.</measure> 
<p>For all this such a public scandal as the death of an old woman from starvation on the workhouse steps on Christmas day, <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, has not been avoided; and the following case presents even more painful features: I quote the newspaper report:-- <QUOTE>Some excitement was occasioned <pb id="p.152" n="152"> yesterday, <datestruct VALUE="1860-12-25"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=25>25</day>, <year reg=1860>1860</year></datestruct>, in the neighbourhood of Lisson Grove, by the discovery of a poor deaf and dumb man in a dying state, from shocking neglect and destitution, in <num value="1">one</num> of Hedge's Cottages, Chapel Street, Edgeware Road. The discovery was made, it appears, by Ann Dunn, a resident of No. <num value="3">3</num>, Hedge's Cottages, who at once called the attention of the police to the unfortunate man. He was found in an almost naked state, frightfully dirty and emaciated, presenting the appearance of long-standing neglect, and of not having tasted food for days. He was removed in a helpless, but sensible condition, upon a stretcher to the St. Marylebone Workhouse, where he was immediately admitted, and evinced much delight at the kind treatment and attention which was readily given him by the officers of the house. Mr. Fuller, the resident surgeon, immediately attended him, and at <num value="1">first</num> some hopes were entertained of his recovery, but he expired about <num value="2">two</num> hours after his admission. His name, it has been ascertained, is Robert Hussey, aged <num value="45">forty-five</num>; and his death is a <pb id="p.153" n="153"> melancholy instance of the shocking destitution of the metropolis even at Christmas.</QUOTE> 
<p>The Rev. Mr. Davies, writing upon metropolitan distress in <title>Macmillan's Magazine</title> for <datestruct VALUE="1861-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>, has the following remarks in defence of the parochial administration of this workhouse :-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>I admit, however, that notwithstanding the good intentions of the board, the results of their administration are by no means of a kind that would defy criticism. Not to speak of the insuperable difficulties of a constant weary struggle against vice, and idleness, and fraud, the management of so vast a business as that of the St. Marylebone Workhouse requires great administrative capacity and constant vigilance; and a board of <num value="30">thirty</num> perfectly equal members, elected every year, does not promise much efficiency in government. 
<p><gap>

<p>But even if such blots were more numerous and discreditable than they are, it is obvious--and no well-informed person could forget it--that the substantial relief of the poor <pb id="p.154" n="154"> is, and must be, the work of the guardians, and that <hi rend=italics>the better this work is done the less the public hear of it.</hi> At the same time, the public have ample opportunities of knowing what is going on at the workhouse, through the meetings, open to ratepayers and reporters, at the workhouse and the vestry, and through the reports in the local newspapers. But the poorlaw administration does not exterminate distress, nor pretend to do it. <hi rend=italics>No system of relief, however charitable, could possibly put an end to distress.</hi>
The causes of physical misery, whilst they remain, make that misery inevitable. In those instances of undoubted destitution which have been detailed before the magistrates and elsewhere, we do not know how much is due to drunkenness, that plague and curse of our poor. And how can you keep a drunkard out of want? Another cause of distress is scarcely less difficult to cope with--the imbecility and want of energy which infects some persons like a disease. Then there is the downright idleness of not a few, which keeps them from <pb id="p.155" n="155"> seeking work, and throws them out of occupation when they get it. The destitution which arises from sickness and misfortune--the character of the sufferers having been reasonably good--ought to be relieved humanely by the workhouse, if not more indulgently cared for, as <num value="1">one</num> might surely hope it would be, by the kindness of friends and by Christian charity.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Passing out of Marylebone and the north proper, through the adjacent district of Paddington, on my road to a notorious western locality at Kensington called the Potteries, I looked at some old almshouses standing opposite the Vestry Hall, near the Green. They belong to the parish, according to the inscription on the front, and are, to all appearance, in as low a sanitary condition as some of the worst huts in Clerkenwell. They lie below the level of the road, are small, ill-ventilated, and dirty, and afford a very poor shelter to their wrinkled inmates. A tall man can almost touch their roofs from the pavement; and their continuance in the present position and condition must arise from <pb id="p.156" n="156"> what Jeremy Bentham called an absurd regard for the directions of the dead. 
<p>The Potteries, at Kensington--a marshy district lying in the hollow behind the villas at Bayswater and Notting Hill--is in nearly the same condition now as it was some <num value="10">ten</num> years ago, when attention was called to it in <title>Household Words.</title> It is like nothing in and about London except Agar Town, and its interior and approaches are even worse than those of that house of call for the workhouse even in its worst days. Most of the roads into it must be what are known as <QUOTE>undedicated roads</QUOTE> --highways not yet given up to or adopted by the public, and, consequently, dedicated to nothing but rivers of mud. The inhabitants are pig-trainers and brickmakers, keepers of ducks and fowls, <QUOTE>fanciers</QUOTE> of spurring gamecocks, and red-jawed bull-terriers, and supporters of the very lowest forms of sporting. The pothouses advertise <QUOTE>Rat matches every Monday night,</QUOTE> and the <num value="1">first</num> sight I saw was that of <num value="2">two</num> fowls which were combating in a dreary swamp of black manure-drainage, broken bottles, old <pb id="p.157" n="157"> bricks, and mud. The huts have grown a little the worse for wear, as all things do, and they hold together by some principle not yet discovered or laid down by theoretical builders. The settlement still retains its old proportions. It occupies about <num value="9">nine</num> acres of ground, numbers nearly <num value="300">three hundred</num> houses and hovels, including some of the neighbouring extensions, and contains at least a <num value="1000">thousand</num> of its original population. Refuse matter is still collected by the pig-trainers from club-houses and hotels, and boiled down in coppers, that the fat may be separated for sale. This business existed here long before the district rose around it, as it still exists in other outskirts of London; and the old inhabitants defend their right to the place, not only with legal parchments, but with energetic tongues. As a body they are happy and independent, and when sickness seizes <num value="1">one</num> of them, a basin is carried round the huts, and a collection is made. They have a village Hampden, who visits coffee-houses, reads newspapers, thinks for himself, speaks for others, and takes his stand upon the broad fact that pigs <pb id="p.158" n="158"> must be trained somewhere in a Christian land. He boasts that the pig-trainers have always paid <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure> in the pound, and is not at all disposed to sit down quietly under what he calls misrepresentation. 
<p> <QUOTE>We're not swine,</QUOTE> he said; <QUOTE>we don't lie in that there mud. We train pigs and we train children. There's a hut yonder that doesn't look fit for a donkey to live in, according to the editor of the <title>Bayswater Chronicle</title>; but let me tell that man, or any man--let me tell you, sir--that the old woman as has lived in that hut for <num value="40">forty</num> years has brought up as large a family of nice spoken boys as any woman in the Potteries. Let &lsquo;em come to me when they've got anything to say agen the place--let &lsquo;em meet me and talk it out at the temp&lsquo;rance-hall, and I'll not shrink from &lsquo;em. There's ignorant people here, people as doesn't know a trough from a brickbat; who doesn't know the proper pronunciation of prudence, as I may say; but they ain't everybody. People as call theirselves Christians ain't got no right to come here and write books about us, <pb id="p.159" n="159"> calling us a lot of pigs; and I'll get that book as I've heerd on and tell Mrs. Bayly a bit of my mind.</QUOTE> 
<p>This last remark applied to a work recently published about missionary work in the Potteries, called <QUOTE>Ragged Homes, and how to Mend Them,</QUOTE> which seems to have hurt the feelings of the village Hampden. The place, he considered, had never been fairly dealt with, either in illustrated journals, local newspapers, or volumes. 
<p> <QUOTE>Look at that brick-field,</QUOTE> he said, <QUOTE>which we calls  <Q>the hocean;</Q>  there's nothing much the matter with that. A brick-field ain't a drawingroom. Well, a gent comes down here and takes a pictur&lsquo; of that brick-field, and makes it look a hawful place. He puts in such a hut as I never see, and makes out that all the roofs of our cottages is covered with cow-dung. Now that ain't the way to go and talk about people, and show people up. We're sure to see these things now, because a working-man goes to his coffee-shop, reads his newspapers, and is not such a fool as he's often made out.</QUOTE> <pb id="p.160" n="160"> 
<p>Public discussion on the spot, he thought, was the only way of arriving at the truth, and he knew many who could stand up for their settlement. He looked upon the whole land as a grant from a former Bishop of London, and the brickmakers as interlopers and trespassers. 
<p>If settlers are wedded to a place like this, where, according to a sanitary report for <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>, the average age at death is under <num value="12">twelve</num> years, and where there is nothing to look at but clay, pools of stagnant water, and the most wretched hovels, there is no help for them. The pig-trainers must be left in possession of their happy hunting-grounds, and what little pity we have may be bestowed upon the brickmakers. These hardworking people are huddled together on the borders of the swine preserves, in huts provided for them by their employer, at a rental of <num value="2">two</num> and <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings</measure> a week. They live here, for the old reason, to be <QUOTE>near their bread,</QUOTE> and they get nothing for their rental but the barest covering. The public privy, of course, does duty for a whole row of huts, and there is no more water <pb id="p.161" n="161"> now for this part of the settlement than there was some <num value="10">ten</num> years ago. A school, with a service, is provided by their landlord, but this is hardly a substitute for the commonest necessaries, comforts, and conveniences. The same attempt to supply physical deficiencies by showy educational and spiritual stop-gaps I noticed in Agar Town. 
<p>I should like to hear the village Hampden on this topic, at the local temperance hall, with the owner of the huts and brickfield in the chair. <pb id="p.162" n="162">

<p>It has long been the boast of moving panoramas that their chief aim is to convey instruction. They carry us across America, or from Southampton to India; they hop from city to city throughout Europe, or they glide past with certain pictures of Australia, but they avoid a sketch of London. No speculator has ever been bold enough to grapple with the back streets-the human warrens--on the south side of the metropolis; to start from Bermondsey, on the borders of Deptford, and wriggle through the existing miles of dirt, vice, and crime, as far as the Lambeth Marshes. Picturesque as poverty and wretchedness look upon canvas, free as pictures are from harsh voices and unpleasant smells, no attempt has ever been made to deal with the <pb id="p.166" n="166"> black-holes of London in this popular form, and the <QUOTE>Special Correspondent</QUOTE> still remains in possession of the property. 
<p>A very vast and melancholy property it is. 
<NOTE>The permanent poor in the district allotted to the Southwark police court alone, have been recently calculated at, <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num>.</NOTE>
Within the boundaries before mentioned, and down in the hollow of the water-side basin of London, lighted up at intervals with special markets of industry, or budding into short patches of honest trade, sinking every now and then into dark acres of crime, and covered everywhere with the vilest sores of prostitution, are something like <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num> people, or <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="7">seventh</num> part of the whole metropolitan population. In many respects, its standard of civilization is lower than either that of Whitechapel or St. George's in the East, especially in the Southwark and Waterloo Road districts. It has scores of streets that are rank and steaming with vice; streets where unwashed, drunken, fishy-eyed women hang by dozens out of the windows, beckoning to the <pb id="p.167" n="167"> passers-by. It has scores of streets filled with nothing but thieves, brown, unwholesome tramps' lodging-houses, and smoky receptacles for stolen goods. To look at such places--to know from experience that they have existed in this state for <num value="20">twenty</num> years, and to learn from history that many have been notorious for more than a century --makes me doubt whether the world has really such things as working vestries, inspectors of nuisances, police authorities, and local selfgovern- ment. I am no advocate for routing out the industrious poor from an overcrowded district to make room for stucco temples or ornamental squares. Such metropolitan improvements are merely quieting doses for grumbling ratepayers, and schemes for benefiting <num value="1">one</num> corner of London at the expense of another. The working-classes in most cases must live where their bread grows, and there are Acts of Parliament more than enough to exercise a control over the structure and arrangement of their dwellings. But the recognized haunts of vice and crime want no ventilation, no enlargement, no tinkering philanthropy. <pb id="p.168" n="168"> They ought to be ploughed up by the roots. The Mint, in Southwark, is still the dear old collection of dens which it was in the days of our grandfathers, and, if it has no murky cellars like old St. Giles's, this virtue is due more to its geological formation than to its local self-government. The foundations are nothing but rotten muck. The whole district is far below the level of high-water mark in the river, and the sewage in many places bubbles up through the floors. The courts and alleys branch off on either side at every step, leading into endless mazes of low, sooty passages, squares, and <QUOTE>rents.</QUOTE> Some of these holes and corners must have received their titles from the most bitter satirists, for they bear such names as White-hind Alley and Dove Court--emblems of purity--Rose Passage and Melior Street. In some cases a little learning and mystery are combined in the name, and <num value="1">one</num> row of stunted dwellings is known as Pariatealia Place. In another case the proprietor of the property is less ambitious, and is contented with the humble and appropriate name of Halfpenny Court. <pb id="p.169" n="169"> Considering the alarming fruitfulness of mothers in most of these wretched neighbourhoods, I should like to have some of the places christened Malthus Yard. This is a suggestion for the consideration of the Metropolitan Board of Works. 
<p>A local correspondent, Mr. Dexter, writing <datestruct VALUE="1860-01-30"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=30>30</day>, <year reg=1860>1860</year></datestruct>, gives this neighbourhood the same character as I do :-- <QUOTE>Hundreds of the poor,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>living in Pariatealia Place and the courts, passages, squares and rents so thickly surrounding it, flock daily from <num value="11">eleven</num> till <num value="1">one</num> to the soup-kitchen. I am sorry I cannot give a better account of the neighbourhood than you do. Your statements are strictly true; and a more favourable relation would be wanting in accuracy. If any <num value="1">one</num> will muster up courage sufficient for the task, and visit the people of the district, he will find more misery, wretchedness, and almost starvation than he would care to see often. I could point to Palmer's Rents--I think the next turning to Pariatealia Place; in <num value="1">one</num> house would be found a blind girl, who, in the summer time, <pb id="p.170" n="170"> works at fancy knitting, in the City, but who, from illness and other causes, is so reduced that she cannot pursue her usual avocations. She has had no relief but the bread and soup the Melior Street soup-kitchen has supplied. <num value="3">Three</num> doors nearer Snow's Fields may be found <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> families in a small house. On the ground-floor is a labourer with a wife and <num value="4">four</num> small children. Nearly all the furniture and clothing they had has been disposed of, in order that the children, <num value="1">one</num> of whom is ill, might not absolutely starve. At the top of the house may be found a self-reliant Irishwoman, who has struggled hard to keep herself her brother and sister-in-law, and their children. But neighbours, as poor as herself, cannot find employment enough for her, and her brother has been several weeks out of employment, and unable to provide anything for his own family; while, to make the case still worse, his wife was last week confined. These cases are not isolated ones, but samples from very many hundreds, which lie together sickeningly close in these densely crowded courts and ill-ventilated houses. <pb id="p.171" n="171"> It will be long ere affairs can improve much among these people.</QUOTE> 
<p>The dreary zig-zag panorama of the south side of London--the part that is popularly known under the head of <QUOTE><hi rend=italics></hi>over the water</QUOTE> --might open at Lower Bermondsey, near Jacob's Island. Here we begin with an old, dilapidated red-brick mansion, sunken, decayed, chipped, and neglected, let out in tenements, with rowing-sculls in its passage, a boat lying high and dry in its yard, and its old gardens covered with courts and huts of the most wretched character. Its over-hanging, hood-like porch is still full of the ancient mouldings, representing clusters of fruits and flowers, and containing the date, <foreign>in relievo</foreign>, of <datestruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct>. Near this place is a black, shattered wooden building, which looks in its outlines like those houses which children draw upon slates at the early age of <num value="3">three</num> years. The courts at the back are crowded with hovels, whose rooms have not always got doors, and whose windows have not always got sashes. There are bare, black bits of ground occasionally containing <num value="1">one</num> withered <pb id="p.172" n="172"> tree; and close courts with public yards, where the inhabitants have the usual privy in common. The rents are <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> and <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings</measure> a week by the room, or <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> a week by the house. In <num value="1">one</num> yard a ragged crippled man and a ragged child were spinning a rope, while a sooty woman, with an infant, looked on from <num value="1">one</num> of the window-holes; and in another yard a decent old woman, whose room sent forth a gust of hot irons, was quarrelling with a bricklayer about the drain. <QUOTE>I never see such people as you are,</QUOTE> said the man, <QUOTE>you're never satisfied!</QUOTE> 
<p>Going towards London Bridge, you can branch off on either side, and visit numerous small courts and alleys, more or less dirty, neglected, and degraded, but you will find nothing, perhaps, worse than Magdalen Court, in Tooley Street. It is a blind alley of small <num value="2">two</num>-storied houses--close, dwarfed, foul, and unwholesome; filled with the lowest order of people who prey upon sailors, and curtained at intervals with patched clothes, hanging across to dry from house to house. The rents are high, as an extra profit is always made <pb id="p.173" n="173"> out of such places, and the houses let for about <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">seven</num> shillings</measure> a week. There are hundreds of such courts at Wapping and Rotherhithe, on both sides of the river, filled with coarse drunken women, whose thick fingers are covered with showy rings. Sometimes a crew of Malay sailors are enticed into these traps; raw spirits are sent for in basins and quart pots from the neighbouring publichouses; robbery, quarrels, and madness follow, as a matter of course; knives are drawn, a <QUOTE>muck</QUOTE> is run, and the whole bleeding, riotous, drunken population roll out into the open thoroughfare. 
<p>Bermondsey Street will show you a few more holes and corners on your road to the back of St. George's Church, in the Borough, every place being painfully like every other place, and every inhabitant, with a few struggling exceptions, painfully like every other inhabitant. Here is an extract from the letter of another local correspondent written in <datestruct VALUE="1861-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>, about the Bermondsey Ragged Schools:-- <QUOTE>I am sorry to say that the distress is still very great, as there are so many out of work. I have before me a <pb id="p.174" n="174"> list of cases filled up by the visitors, several of which I have also visited myself. This list consists of <num value="19">nineteen</num> of these destitute families, containing a total of <num value="115">one hundred and fifteen</num> human beings. <num value="3">Three</num> of the fathers are unable to work through illness. Some have been out of work <num value="4">four</num> and <num value="5">five</num> months, some <num value="9">nine</num> and <num value="10">ten</num> weeks, and the rest are unable to get work at present. Most of these families occupy but <num value="1">one</num> room. The following are some of the notes of the visitors:  <Q>Not tasted food to-day</Q> -- <Q> Very needy case,</Q> -- <Q>This case has not sought relief,</Q> -- <Q>The home very clean, but empty,</Q> -- <Q>The family is very much distressed,</Q> -- <Q>When visited, no food nor fire,</Q> -- <Q><num value="1">One</num> room, very wretched.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<p>When you arrive at the back of St. George's Church, you may look up Kent Street, another nest of dirt, vice, and over-crowding, which is in much the same state as it was when Smollett called it <QUOTE>a beggarly and ruinous suburb,</QUOTE> and bemoaned the necessity for bringing visitors from the Continent through it on their road into London. It was then the highway from <pb id="p.175" n="175"> Southwark to Dover--part of the Old Kent Road--and the French mail was often robbed while passing along it. The plan was to draw a rope across the entrance, over which the horse stumbled, and the post-boy had to return to the city and report the loss of his bags. Its character now is very slightly improved, and it is still the worthy companion of its neighbour, the Mint. 
<p>Passing over the Borough Road and down Mint Street, you will find yourself in the citadel of thieves. The low lodging-houses here-where beds are let at threepence a night--form the chief evidences of trade. At <num value="1">one</num> of the doors of these saffron-coloured places I saw a half-drunken militiaman and a black sailor, but very few hulking men standing at the corners. There were few children in the muddy roads, and the silence was as noticeable as in Old Nichols Street, Shoreditch. Norfolk Street is the most notorious thoroughfare in this district-often figuring in the police reports; but every by-court and alley is choking with filth, vice, and crime. 
<p>Most people know, or have heard, something <pb id="p.176" n="176"> about the Mint, in Southwark, and I will not, therefore, dwell upon that, but pass down to the St. Peter's district, near the river and Southwark Bridge. Here the inhabitants are chiefly labourers about the wharves, and dredgers, who get their living on the river by fishing for bits of old cord, iron, and fish. They seldom go lower than Deptford, and their gains are very precarious. Over-crowding is very common amongst them-<num value="6">six</num>, <num value="8">eight</num>, and <num value="10">ten</num> people living in <num value="1">one</num> room, and this long after the sons and daughters have grown up into young men and women. There are instances where the son or daughter will get married, and bring home the wife or husband to the same house or room, and thus <num value="2">two</num> families are compelled to huddle together. This is very common in such neighbourhoods, as all delicacy of feeling, even when the inhabitants are not steeped in poverty, has been early destroyed in youth. Education means something more than merely learning lessons out of a book, and habits early implanted last longer even than leases, districts, or towns. <pb id="p.177" n="177"> 
<p>Some of the houses in the courts about the Skin Market, although standing in an ancient neighbourhood--near the supposed site of the Globe Theatre and the old Bear Garden-have been built within the last <num value="20">twenty</num> years. There is Pleasant Place, where the rooms are only about <num value="3">three</num> yards wide, the back-yard about <num value="3">three</num> feet square, and the windows not more than <num value="2">two</num> feet and a half square. The court or passage in front is in exact proportion with these dimensions, and the houses stand in <num value="3">three</num> parallel rows with their faces to each others' backs. I stood at the side of <num value="1">one</num> of the end houses, and it seemd to me that I could almost span it with my arms. Each house lets for about <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> a week, and contains <num value="2">two</num> of these confined rooms. In White Hind Alley, near this place, there is a row of old black, rotten, wooden dwellings, chiefly rented by river thieves. This wretched district is watched over by the Rev. M. Mungeam (who kindly took me over it), the honorary secretary of the South London Visiting and Relief Association--a benevolent society which <pb id="p.178" n="178"> strives to do all the good it can in the vast expanse of London <QUOTE>over the water,</QUOTE> but whose funds are not equal to its work. It is a branch of the Metropolitan District Visiting Society at Charing Cross, and draws some part of its support from the parent source. Most of the local clergymen on the south side are on the committee. 
<p>Nearly the whole of the streets, courts, and alleys about Gravel Lane and Blackfriars are equally filthy, crowded, and faded. Crossing over the main road, we open up another channel of social degradation in the New Cut. The entrance to this thoroughfare in the Blackfriars Road is depressing enough, and the sight does not improve as you get further in. You begin with a closed block of houses, covered from garret to basement with fluttering rags of bills, and at every step you may glance right and left into wavy, smoky, damp, dismal side thoroughfares. No house to house visitation is necessary to show you the social condition of these places; they are either full of low prostitutes, with few children in the roads, or the roads are crowded with <pb id="p.179" n="179"> children and the houses are full of the working poor. Each street has got a dingy beer-shop, if not a public-house, and at least <num value="1">one</num> small coalshed, advertising <QUOTE>an enormous fall in coals.</QUOTE> Such streets run at right angles into the Waterloo Road, cross over that very mangy thoroughfare, and continue into the heart of Lambeth, by the side of the South Western Railway. Granby Street is perhaps the worst sample of a prostitutes' street in this neighbourhood, and the vice it contains overflows in every house and oozes out on to the pavement. 
<p>The New Cut does not differ much from Shoreditch, or Chapel Street, Somers Town, and it may be shortly described as a succession of groves. There are groves of stiff cheap clothing, groves of hardware, groves of flabbylooking meat, groves of boots, and groves of haberdashery; with the stalls of costermongers, filled with fish and vegetables, lining the gutters. There are plenty of gin-shops and a few cheap bakers, and at <num value="1">one</num> corner stands the Victoria Theatre, formerly called the Coburg. It is a <pb id="p.180" n="180"> large, well-built house, and has been celebrated, in its time, for good acting; but it is now <num value="1">one</num> of the <QUOTE>threepenny theatres,</QUOTE> giving a very coarse kind of drama, suited to its audiences. The fittings are faded, the walls are smeared with greasy dirt, the pit floor is muddy and half covered with orange peel and broken bottles, and the whole place is a little cleaner than the courts and alleys at its back, but nothing more. The audience are worth looking at; and on the night of a popular drama, such as <QUOTE>Oliver Twist,</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>Jack Sheppard,</QUOTE> the gallery presents a most extraordinary picture. Half the evil, low-browed, lowering faces in London are wedged in, <num value="1200">twelve-hundred</num> deep, perspiring, watchful, silent. Every man is in his yellow shirt sleeves, every woman has her battered bonnet in her lap. The yell when Bill Sykes murders Nancy is like the roar of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> wild beasts, and they show their disapprobation of the act, and their approbation of the actor, by cursing him in no measured terms. I once heard an eminent performer say <pb id="p.181" n="181"> that he looked upon hisses as applause when he played Iago; and if he played it at the Victoria Theatre, earnestly and powerfully, he would stand a chance of being spit upon and pelted. The most daring <QUOTE>star</QUOTE> never ventures to appear at this dramatic temple. 
<p>Not far from this place--towards the end of our panorama--nestling at the back of the Waterloo Road, immediately under the shadow of the large engineering premises of Messrs. Maudslay, Sons, and Field, is a reproduction of the worst features of a back settlement in Manchester, Bolton, or Birmingham. In no part of the overcrowded parish of Lambeth--a parish that probably contains nearly <num value="170000">one hundred and seventy thousand</num> people--are there any streets more badly built, more neglected, or more hopelessly filthy and miserable than Jurston Street, Cooper Street, and their adjacent thoroughfares. Here is a sample of what a great manufactory may nourish--nearly always does nourish-under its lofty walls. The labourer receives his fair day's wages for his fair day's work, according <pb id="p.182" n="182"> to the market price; finds it necessary, like all other labourers, to be <QUOTE>near his bread;</QUOTE> crowds upon a particular spot, and gets a wretched dwelling at a very high price. <num value="6">Six</num> and <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">seven</num> shillings</measure> a week are paid for dwarfed houses in and about this London Bolton, and this for the privilege of living within the sound of the factory bell--of being surrounded by dust-heaps in the streets, and fronted by a yard, called Owen's Yard, let out as a winter refuge for showmen's vans. Most of the regular inhabitants here are employed at the engineering works, and the showmen--the vagrants as they would be called, squatting for a shilling a week in their yellow smoking boxes upon wheelslook down upon these toiling householders with pity and contempt. They have let out their giants, their fat women, their dwarfs, their spotted boys, and boa-constrictors, to different exhibitors about London, and they form a half-gipsy settlement in this public yard, free from bad drainage and overcrowded rooms. 
<p>Behind some of the houses at the end of <pb id="p.183" n="183"> Jurston Street, behind a ZZZeats'-meat shop, where the proprietors complained that they were not able <QUOTE>to get their money in,</QUOTE> are a few rows of stumpy, close cottages standing in very rotten yards. There is no gas-lamp to light this part of the settlement (this is the case with many similar places), and after dusk the inhabitants have to feel their way in and out of their houses. <num value="1">One</num> of the male residents was looking at an overflowing drain, which was evidently faulty, and I asked him if he ever had a visit from the local inspector of nuisances. 
<p> <QUOTE>Inspector!</QUOTE> he said. <QUOTE>We never see no inspector down here--no nothing, except the landlord for his rent.</QUOTE> 
<p>As I threaded my way out of this black, smoky, wretched Bolton-looking district I met <num value="2">two</num> tallymen coming in to dun their debtors, with their oil-skin packs under their arms, and a cabman clearing out, with what, I presume, were his worldly goods--an old round table, and a few battered chairs crammed inside a Hansom cab. <pb id="p.184" n="184"> <pb id="p.185" n="185"> <pb id="p.186" n="186">

<p>The time has now arrived for a new Chamber of Horrors; a room not veiled under the thin apologetic title of <QUOTE>A Chamber of Comparative Physiognomy,</QUOTE> but a fearful national apartment, supported out of the national taxation, and standing as a national monument of disgrace and shame. It shall not be filled with the sullen faces of murderers and regicides; it shall not be so broad in design that it may exhibit horrors of all countries; and it shall not be merely a wax-work holiday show for gaping rustics. It shall be a Poor-law Museum of men, women, and children starved to death in England--in merry England--in wealthy England--in the country famed for nothing so much as its homely virtues; it shall be set up on the <pb id="p.188" n="188"> waste ground usually devoted to heroic statues in Parliament Street, Westminster, and, while it shall be a warning to reckless, breeding paupers, it shall be the standing curse of the Poor-law Board, and every poor-law official throughout the country. The world is too busy, the newspapers are too universal in their aspirations, and our statesmen are thinking far too much of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, to devote more than a passing glance to these most awful deaths, unless they are brought before them in a blunt, material shape. The dead man is hurried away in the parish coffin, the usual curt line is recorded in the registrar's book, the paragraph in the newspaper corner is read and forgotten, and the whole thing is buried in eternal night. This is not enough; and, for the sake of those strugglers who are left, we require more. Per-centages, averages, and all the hocus-pocus of statistics are only mists, fogs, curtains, and sleeping-draughts, except to the official mind; and we, the public, require something more gross--and more palpable.

<p>The <num value="1">first</num> stone of the New Chamber of Horrors must be laid at once; its architecture must be in keeping with its contents; famished paupers must support its entablature, in the shape of caryatides, and the death's head must blossom on every column.

<p> <QUOTE>Mr. Humphreys, the coroner for the eastern division of the county of Middlesex, held an inquest on Wednesday, at the Black Horse Tavern, Kingsland Road, upon the body of <pb id="p.191" n="191"> Thomas Bates, a cabinet-maker, aged <num value="62">sixty-two</num>, who committed suicide by hanging himself in a public-house where he lodged. The evidence of the deceased's daughter and another witness was to the effect that he complained that he could not obtain admission to Shoreditch workhouse, and, in reply to an offer on the part of his daughter to accompany him there, he said,  <Q> they would bully the eyes out of her head if she went.</Q>  He was very infirm and not able to work, although he did sometimes earn threepence or fourpence a day, and his children, who were all in poor circumstances, sometimes gave him a few halfpence. The deceased said several times that, if he were not admitted into the house, he should destroy himself. Upon the <datestruct value="0-11-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct> he told the witness that he had applied, but had been refused admission, but was to have <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure> and sixpence a week and a <measure value="4l." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> pound</measure> loaf of bread for <num value="3">three</num> months. The relieving officer denied that the deceased had applied for admission into the workhouse. It appeared that the deceased was <pb id="p.192" n="192"> an inmate of the house from <datestruct VALUE="1859-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>, to the <datestruct value="0-08-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct> last, during which time he was in the sick ward suffering from chronic bronchitis, but on the latter date he was discharged from the doctor's list as  <Q>relieved.</Q>  He was then called before the board, who directed him to be discharged with an allowance of <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure> a week and a <measure value="4l." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> pound</measure> loaf for <num value="2">two</num> weeks. The clerk to the guardians said the deceased quitted the workhouse voluntarily, but afterwards qualified that statement by admitting that the man had not applied to be discharged, and that the board had ordered him to leave the house. Dr. James Clark, surgeon to the Shoreditch workhouse, who attended him while he was an inmate, stated that deceased, when discharged by him  <Q>relieved,</Q>  on the <datestruct value="0-08-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, was not able-bodied, and was not in a fit condition to leave the house. After a lengthened inquiry, at which the Board of Guardians were represented by their solicitor, the jury returned a verdict that the deceased hung himself while in an unsound state of <pb id="p.193" n="193"> mind, through having been refused admission to the workhouse.</QUOTE> 
<p>By the side of Thomas Bates we shall place William Gurr, and tell his story as we find it recorded in the public journals of <datestruct VALUE="1860-12-23"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=23>23</day>, <year reg=1860>1860</year></datestruct>: 
<p> <QUOTE>On Monday, <datestruct VALUE="0-12-17"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=17>17</day></datestruct>, an inquest was held before the coroner, at the Market-house Tavern, Finsbury Market, Shoreditch, on the body of William Gurr, aged <num value="67">sixty-seven</num> years, a blacksmith, who died from starvation. Mary Gurr, of No. <num value="2">2</num>, King's Head Court, Long Alley, stated that she was the widow of the deceased, who had been very reduced and destitute. On Thursday fortnight he went into Shoreditch workhouse. Witness succeeded in obtaining a little work, and would not go into the establishment, as she could earn with her daughter about <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> per week, and <num value="3">three</num> persons had to subsist and pay rent out of that amount. Deceased came out on Monday, the <num value="3">3rd</num> instant, after being in the workhouse <num value="4">four</num> days. He said to witness,  <Q>I would rather be at home, <pb id="p.194" n="194"> however much trouble I am in.</Q>  The deceased left the workhouse and went before the Board of Guardians, who, after hearing the case, ordered him <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence and a loaf weekly. The deceased then came home and died in a few days afterwards. They never had meat for months. The only things they had to live upon were dry bread, treacle, dripping, with a little tea and sugar; and no beer. They were very deficient of wearing apparel and bedding. The deceased had not been able to work for the last eighteen months. The <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence per week from the parish, and the <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> witness and her daughter earned, were all they had to subsist on and to pay rent, food, and firing. I believe that the deceased died from want of food and the necessaries of life. When the deceased went into the workhouse he was so ill from weakness and debility that he reeled and staggered as he walked. He had nothing at home but dry bread for days. While in the workhouse the deceased had <num value="1">one</num> day tea for breakfast, <num value="1">one</num> day meat, another day <pb id="p.195" n="195"> pudding, and meat again on Sunday. Deceased only had meat twice while in the workhouse, and no stimulants. After other evidence, Mr. Thomas Pool Collier, surgeon, said that the deceased was dead when he was called. Had made a post-mortem examination. Several of the organs were healthy, but the stomach only contained a little water-gruel. There was not the slightest trace of fat inside or outside the body. The walls of the stomach were thin from want of nourishment, and the body was much emaciated. The coroner having commented on the case at some length, the jury returned a verdict of  <Q>Died from starvation through the want of the common necessaries of life.</Q> </QUOTE>

<div2 type="chapter" n="11" id="c.11"><HEAD>Our London Model Lodging-Houses. 
<p>After dwelling so long upon the <QUOTE>horrors of London,</QUOTE> I naturally turned to the other side of the account, and looked at what had been done or was doing to improve the homes of the poor. I knew that the <QUOTE>Board of Health</QUOTE> had come and gone, and was now represented by the Government Local Management Act Office-a shadow of a shade. I knew that a Common Lodging Houses Act, to prevent the huddling together of different families in <num value="1">one</num> room had been in operation for some years, and that its provisions were enforced, or not enforced, according to the energy and conscientiousness of the local inspectors of nuisances. I knew that many cellar-rooms, called <QUOTE>kitchens,</QUOTE> had been condemned in certain neigbourhoods; many ceilings had been compulsively whitewashed; many drains <pb id="p.200" n="200"> had been constructed; and many rotten dustheaps had been removed. I knew that there had been much talk, and much writing, about the social condition of the labouring classes, and that if I only held up my finger I might be deluged with pamphlets on this deathless subject. Although a writer by profession, I have a constitutional horror of English composition about any real work that requires to be done. Receiving certain reports, tracts, and prospectuses, more as a guide to places than to results, I went once more into the holes and corners of London to see what model lodging-houses we have really got. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> place I arrived at was a block of buildings in St. Pancras, lying between Agar Town and Chapel Street, Somers Town, the worst parts of the parish. They belong to a London society, started to some extent upon commercial principles, called the <QUOTE>Metropolitan Association for improving the dwellings of the Industrious Classes.</QUOTE> This society, I believe, was founded in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>, and the St. Pancras buildings were the <num value="1">first</num> large block of model houses, or rooms in <pb id="p.201" n="201"> <QUOTE>flats,</QUOTE> erected in London. They are laid out to accommodate about <num value="110">one hundred and ten</num> families, with about <num value="420">four hundred and twenty</num> rooms, at a rental varying from <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence to <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">seven</num> shillings</measure> a week for each set of rooms. The highest prices give the command of <num value="3">three</num> fair-sized rooms and a scullery, with every convenience. The plan of these rooms is very much like that of the <QUOTE>flat</QUOTE> dwellings in Edinburgh. The outer door secures the family from intrusion, and locks in the household at night. The sittingroom is equal in size to the <num value="2">two</num> bed-rooms, and the latter are reached by <num value="2">two</num> doors, <num value="1">one</num> at each side of the sitting-room fireplace. The scullery is a narrow strip, about the length of the sittingroom. The fore-court is an enclosed playground for the children. 
<p>The height of the building is its chief structural defect, although, if the calculations have been carefully made, this ought to enable the association to lower their rents. The tenure is leasehold; the building is apparently made to last for ages; and the nett dividend of the society <pb id="p.202" n="202"> from all their model houses is only about <num value="2">two</num> per cent. The inference is, that too much money has been expended in building for posterity. The rents are grumbled at by many of the tenants, although they are under the market price of the neighbourhood, and too low to meet the expenses of the building, and make a fair return upon the capital sunk, according to the average yield of London house property. The winding well staircases, running up perhaps about <num value="60">sixty</num> feet, with no protection at the sides or landings but an iron railing, reaching no higher than the waist of a man, are sad mistakes of the architect and builder. These staircases, at any hour of the day, are like Jacob's ladders swarming with children, and many accidents and deaths have occurred, so I was told, in the house, in consequence of these deep pits not being closed in. The necessary rail-guards should be fixed at once; such traps for careless, unwatched children, in a philanthropic building, are a disgrace that ought to be got rid of without an appeal to law. 
<p>The occupants are chiefly the higher class of <pb id="p.203" n="203"> labourers and artisans, and the regular payment of the different rents would show this, even if the friends of the association had not stated it in their reports. This may seem a cheering fact to many people, but to me it bears a different aspect. I will state why I regard it unfavourably a little further on. 
<p>The other London buildings of the association are in different parts of the town. In Nelson Square, Bermondsey, there is accommodation in <QUOTE>flats</QUOTE> for <num value="18">one hundred and eight</num> families; at Queen's Place, Dockhead, <num value="10">ten</num> dwellings have been taken and re-arranged for <num value="10">ten</num> families; and in Albion Buildings, Bartholomew Close, some old houses have been taken, and fitted up so as to lodge decently about <num value="24">twenty-four</num> families. In the east of London, in Albert Street, a block of family dwellings on the <QUOTE>flat</QUOTE> system, has been built for <num value="60">sixty</num> families; in Pelham Street, <num value="12">twelve</num> houses have been built for <num value="12">twelve</num> different families; and similar accommodation has been provided for <num value="9">nine</num> families in cottages in Pleasant Row. In Albert Street, the society has also <pb id="p.204" n="204"> built a set of chambers for single men, with accommodation for <num value="234">two hundred and thirty-four</num> tenants; and they have long held an old house in Compton Street, Soho, in the West, which will lodge <num value="128">one hundred and twenty-eight</num> single men on the same plan. In St. James's, Westminster--not far from this latter place-the association has also built another block of family buildings, capable of housing <num value="60">sixty</num> families. Altogether, we may reckon the population in the society's model houses at the present time, as being nearly <num value="2000">two thousand</num>. 
<p>I have not visited all the houses belonging to this society, because they are not always open to inspection. The tenants, as before stated, belong to the best class of labourers and artisans, and they very properly object to be watched, counted, and inspected. Their wages are not lower than those of Hugh Miller, when he worked as a quarryman, and they show a certain degree of independence. The charity they receive through a sentimental standard of rent, is given to them in such a silent underground way, that they are not <pb id="p.205" n="205"> aware when they receive it. As long as they are allowed to remain in their rooms, and pay their rent punctually, they believe that they are under no obligation to a charitable body of ladies and gentlemen. It would be difficult to persuade them that a nett dividend of only <num value="2">two</num> per cent. upon the capital of their landlords, must prove that something is really given to them that they do not pay for. 
<p>At the chambers for single men in Albert Street, Mile End, I found a large coffee-room, well lighted, well warmed, and fitted up with a due regard to cleanliness and comfort. There was also a kitchen, where a number of the lodgers were cooking and eating their dinners, and a rather dull heavy library, where <num value="1">one</num> man was writing a letter. About <num value="174">one hundred and seventy-four</num> lodgers were on the books (the place will house <num value="234">two hundred and thirty-four</num>), principally clerks, labourers, and mechanics, with a few men living on small superannuations. The beds upstairs were in separate cupboards, very much like the baths at the public wash-houses, each lodger <pb id="p.206" n="206"> having a locker to himself, and a private key. The weekly rent for all this accommodation, which is substantially as good as what is generally given at a West-End club, is only <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence. This sum pays for gas, fire, newspapers, water, soap, towels, and books, as well as the rest of the lodging. 
<p>Looking at the building, and its low charges, I was not surprised to find that its lodgers came from all parts, and that while its nett profits had only been a little over <num value="1">one</num> per cent. upon the outlay, it had not benefited the neighbourhood in any perceptible degree. The Bethnal Green population--the low and really poor--are housed even more badly now than they were before the society started in philanthropic business. They have been pushed on <num value="1">one</num> side, compelled to crowd closer together, because their huts have been pulled down for <QUOTE>improvements</QUOTE> and new buildings, and are looked upon by the managers of model houses with ill-concealed contempt. Even in the family houses at the side of these clubchambers, no weaver or street hawker is to be <pb id="p.207" n="207"> found; the rents, although unremunerative, are pitched too high for such people, and there are standing rules to keep them out. The association is for improving the dwellings of the <QUOTE>industrious classes</QUOTE> --a very loose and windy phrase--and, with <num value="1">one</num> exception, hereafter to be noticed, these model buildings may be looked upon as intruders. At St. Pancras, they have done nothing for the worst class in Somers Town and Agar Town, and they have wasted their means on a class who are well able to help themselves. I can find hundreds of tenants who are attracted to these houses from all sides by the low artificial rents, who have no more right to be pensioners of a half-benevolent society than I have. The costermongers-the street hawkers--the industrious poor, are still rotting up their filthy, ill-drained, ill-ventilated courts, while well-paid mechanics, clerks, and porters, willing to sacrifice a certain portion of their self-respect, are the constant tenants of all these model dwellings.<NOTE>Earl Granville made the following remarks in the House of Lords, <datestruct VALUE="1861-02-28"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1861>1861</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>He now came,</QUOTE> he said, <QUOTE>to the <num value="3">third</num> point, upon which he most entirely agreed--namely, <pb n="p.208"> the incalculable evil of the poorer classes being over-crowded to the extent which they had heard, and which account he believed to be perfectly true. The evil was great, but the difficulty was to find a remedy. The noble earl (Earl of Derby) made no suggestion, except that a committee should be appointed to inquire. The difficulty was enormous; and when they came to deal with the metropolis, with its <num value="3">three</num> millions of inhabitants, it was impossible to deal satisfactorily with the question. He himself was a shareholder, in common with many of their lordships, in the Metropolitan Association for Improving the Dwellings of the Poor, and they received an interest of <num value="2">two</num> per cent., and that was more than he had expected, though it was not an amount which would induce people to regard it as a profitable investment, and the question of interest had a most important bearing when they came to deal with the great question. He himself had spoken to <num value="1">one</num> of the great contractors, and asked him whether it was possible to do what the Metropolitan Association was doing upon a large scale, and get such interest as would tempt persons into speculations of the sort; and after that gentleman had considered the subject in all its bearings, he thought that such a scheme must be fruitless. Another objection to such a scheme was that a great part of the people who went to such places to live were persons who could afford to pay for better lodgings. Even in the model lodging-houses a great many of the apartments had been taken by persons that were above the class whom it was the particular object to reach, and who were huddled up in small rooms.</QUOTE> </NOTE>
 <pb id="p.208" n="208"> 
<p>The club-chambers for single men, I cannot help looking upon as a benevolent mistake. The Soho Chambers never presented any hopeful feature from their commencement, and they have <pb id="p.209" n="209"> long been a financial failure. The Albert Street Chambers, as I have just shown, are the next worst property on the society's books, and these are the only <num value="2">two</num> establishments devoted to single men. Why charity--for charity it is, to a large extent--should lay itself out to help those who are best able to help themselves, I cannot possibly imagine. The tenants of the Soho Chambers have always largely consisted of the idle, not the industrious classes, and there is nearly as much dissipation in wasting whole days reading periodicals over a coffee-room fire, as in playing at skittles or drinking in a tap-room. Idleness is idleness whatever form it takes, and it may always be met with, in large quantities, at these clubchambers. Of all associations, the Society for improving the Dwellings of the <hi rend=italics>Industrious Classes</hi>
is the least bound to help it in certain localities, at a considerable annual loss. 
<p>The family dwellings in Albert Street are carefully arranged; the staircase has no well, and the washhouse is in the playing-ground. The rents vary from <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> a week, for <num value="2">two</num> <pb id="p.210" n="210"> rooms and a scullery, to <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure> a week; the rooms in the area being the lowest in price, and the middle rooms the highest. The rooms at the top of the houses are the most difficult to let, and have been for the last <num value="10">ten</num> years. A great demand exists for model cottages, containing <num value="2">two</num> sets of rooms of <num value="3">three</num> each, for <num value="2">two</num> families; and those near the clubcham- bers, belonging to the society, are never unoccupied. 
<p>In another corner of Bethnal Green--in the worst and poorest part of this large and miserable district--Miss Burdett Coutts has partly built, and is now completing, a block of model lodging houses. They are light, cheerful, and somewhat ecclesiastical in appearance, and form, at present, <num value="3">three</num> sides of a large quadrangle. They stand upon ground formerly occupied by a notorious place called Nova Scotia Gardens, where the Italian boy was murdered, or <QUOTE>burked,</QUOTE> as it was called, some years ago, by Bishop and Williams. 
<p>The east and west wings of these model houses <pb id="p.211" n="211"> are now filled with tenants. The rents in the east wing are <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> a week for <num value="3">three</num> rooms, <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence a week for <num value="2">two</num> rooms, and <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> a week for <num value="1">one</num> room. The rooms are small, but well ventilated; and there is every convenience throughout the house, even to baths. The laundry is at the top of the wing, well supplied with water, and the playing-ground for the children is in the quadrangle below. The staircases have <num value="2">two</num> defects. There is a deep narrow well between the steps, which may lead to some serious accident, unless it be railed over; and the ventilation is too boisterous. Long, arched openings in the walls, running up nearly the whole length of the stairs, make the place too cold in the winter, although they are covered with thick blinds. <num value="200">Two hundred</num> men, women, and children are in the east wing, and <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> in the west wingmaking a population of <num value="3">three</num> hundreds and <num value="50">fifty</num>. When the place is finished this will be more than doubled, and the workmen are now busily employed in building the back row of rooms. The <pb id="p.212" n="212"> rooms in the east wing number about <num value="100">one hundred</num> and eighteen, and in the west wing <num value="15">one hundred and five</num>. The rents in the west wing are a little higher than those in the east wing; being <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure> a week for <num value="3">three</num> rooms, <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> a week for <num value="2">two</num> rooms, and <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence a week for <num value="1">one</num> room. 
<p>I feel a delicacy in criticising the charitable designs of an estimable lady, who has a perfect right to do what she likes with her own. Miss Coutts may have no intention of calling these buildings model lodging-houses, in the popular acceptation of the term, but the public will doubtless so name them for her, and look upon them as improved dwellings for the local poor. This they are not, and never will be, and the sooner the truth is told about them the better. The industrious poor of Bethnal Green are very sparingly represented in them, and then only on the east side. A weaver, who can only earn about <num value="7">seven</num> or <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure> a week in the present condition of his trade, would not be able to pay the rents of such rooms, even if they were large <pb id="p.213" n="213"> enough for his shuttle, which they are not, and even if the manager thought proper to admit him. Street hawkers and the old inhabitants of Nova Scotia Gardens are never found in such places, and the court and alley population are left exactly where they were. The clearance, like all clearances, must have raised their rents, and caused them to huddle more closely together. 
<p>An analysis of the population in the west wing of these new buildings would show something like the following:--A clerk, employed in the city, who came here from Hoxton; a warehouseman, employed in the city, who came here from Clerkenwell; a workman, employed at Woolwich, who runs up and down by the Eastern Counties' Railway; a compositor, employed in the neighbourhood, who came here from the city; a railway guard employed at the railway; the family belonging to the mate of a ship who is in the East Indies; a working cooper, who came here from St. Luke's parish; <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> more warehousemen and clerks, <pb id="p.214" n="214"> who came here from the city; a printer who came here from the country; a labourer who works some distance out of London; with a few working mechanics, perhaps not more than half-a-dozen out of <num value="50">fifty</num> tenants who really sprung from the district. Whatever good such buildings may do, they can never improve the neighbourhood they stand in. They fly over the heads of those who are most in want of improvement, instead of burrowing under their feet. They attract a crowd of sharp-sighted tenants from outside districts who are a little more advanced in cleanliness and civilization, and are quick to see where <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure>&lsquo; worth of comfort is selling at less than half-price. 
<p>The other building belonging to the Association for Improving the Dwellings of the Industrious Classes, which I have spoken of as an exception to the general rule of misappropriation, is the model lodging-house in St. James's, Westminster. Here, the <num value="60">sixty</num> families are chiefly working tailors the staple poor of the district; and although the site is not very cheerful, every <pb id="p.215" n="215"> room is occupied. <num value="3">Three</num> rooms, on the <QUOTE>flat</QUOTE> plan, let here for <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">seven</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence a week; and a <num value="2">second</num> class of rooms, let in blocks of <num value="3">three</num>, at <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">six</num> shillings</measure> and twopence a week. 
<p>The <QUOTE>Healthy Houses,</QUOTE> a small private speculation near here, in Husband Street, are very dark and badly constructed, the bedrooms having no chimneys or fireplaces. <num value="8">Eight</num> families are housed in this block, paying <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence a week for <num value="3">three</num> rooms on the ground floor, and <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">six</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence a week for similar rooms at the top. The best feature about them is the glazed bricks in the passages and staircases, which present a surface that rejects the dirt, and is easily kept clean. 
<p>Passing by the parochial model lodging-houses which exist in St. James's, Westminster, Marylebone, and other parishes, I come to the buildings belonging to the Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes. There are <num value="9">nine</num> establishments; <num value="1">one</num> in George Street, Bloomsbury, for <num value="14">one hundred and four</num> single men <pb id="p.216" n="216"> another in Hatton Garden for <num value="54">fifty-four</num> single men; a <QUOTE>renovated lodging-house</QUOTE> in Charles Street, Drury Lane, for <num value="82">eighty-two</num> single men; and a similar house in King Street, Drury Lane, for <num value="22">twenty-two</num> single men. There are also the renovated dwellings for families in Wild Court, Drury Lane, with <num value="16">one hundred and six</num> rooms; a similar building in Clark's Buildings, Broad Street, St. Giles's, containing <num value="82">eighty-two</num> rooms; the Thanksgiving Model Buildings in Portpool Lane, Gray's Inn Lane, for <num value="20">twenty</num> families, and <num value="128">one hundred and twenty-eight</num> single women, with a public wash-house; the renovated dwellings for families and single men in Tyndall's Buildings, Gray's Inn Lane, containing <num value="87">eighty-seven</num> family rooms, and <num value="40">forty</num> beds for men; and the building in Streatham Street, Bloomsbury, for <num value="54">fifty-four</num> families. 
<p>The society is supported by donations, subscriptions, and loans borrowed at interest, and it has now been in existence for nearly <num value="20">twenty</num> years. It has doubtless done much good in improving the habits of many of the dirty poor, but it has <pb id="p.217" n="217"> also met with the same bitter experiences as the other leading association. The people it has gathered under its wing are not often the class it ought to have started to benefit. In the Streatham Street houses, I saw indications of comfort in those dwellings I could look into which told me that certain well-paid workmen were accepting a lodging partly paid for by charity. <num value="1">One</num> of the warm friends of the association has recently said that <QUOTE>they find no reluctance on the part of the working classes to accept this kind of benevolence.</QUOTE> I can only say, I am sorry for it. The standard of morals must be very low where men with health, strength, and skilled hands, are content to accept anything that they do not fully pay for. 
<p>The building in Streatham Street is rather gloomy, built in a very heavy style to last for centuries, and disfigured by galleries with broad flat brick columns, when iron would have been so much lighter. These columns make the entrances dark, and throw a gloom into the bedrooms in front. The rents are about <num value="6">six</num> or <pb id="p.218" n="218"> <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">seven</num> shillings</measure> a week for <num value="3">three</num> rooms, and <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure> a week for <num value="2">two</num> rooms. The rent-book shows the superior class of tenants who have been sucked into these houses. In the week ending <datestruct VALUE="0-02-2"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=2>2</day></datestruct>, hard as the times are supposed to be, there were only <num value="2">two</num> gaps of a few shillings each in a rental of <measure value="14l." type=currency><num value="14">fourteen</num> pounds</measure> sterling. <num value="1">One</num> of these gaps was caused by a death, the other by a want of work. Can any house-agent, dealing with working people in London, show an equally clear rent-book at the present moment? 
<p>The single men's lodging-houses are very similar to many established by private individuals in different parts of London, particularly those opened by Mr. Sartoris in Commercial Street, Whitechapel. 
<p>I went to the <num value="1">one</num> in Charles Street, Drury Lane, where beds are made up for <num value="82">eighty-two</num> men at fourpence a night each, or <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> a week for each lodger. The beds are clean, and not too close together, and the house has seldom many vacant. In the kitchen, <pb id="p.219" n="219"> about a dozen men were standing about the room, some cooking at the fire, others talking and idling. <num value="1">One</num> old man was writing in <num value="1">one</num> of the boxes, which are like the compartments in common coffee-rooms; and another was asleep, with his head and arms lying amongst some broken potatoes on <num value="1">one</num> of the tables. They looked to me all greasy, faded men-men difficult to keep clean, who smelt of onions, and were mostly out of employment. The old lady, who regarded herself as the mother of them all, told me that many were lawyers' clerks, linen-drapers' assistants, and mechanics. <num value="1">One</num> lodger, a compositor, not then in the house, she had had for years. Some stopped a night only, some a month, some came from the country; and occasionally a few thieves crept in as lodgers, and stole a few of the other lodgers' clothes. She had never had but <num value="1">one</num> costermonger--a most superior man of his kind, who lived there for <num value="2">two</num> years, until he got married, when he left, most probably to live up a court. 
<p>Nearly all the kitchens of these places reminded <pb id="p.220" n="220"> me very much of a low ward in a debtors' prison, particularly the kitchen in Charles Street. 
<p>The society claims to be instituted for improving the condition of the labouring classes. Here, I am sorry to say, we have another loose phrase adopted as the watchword, or key-note of an association, which is well-intentioned, and royally supported in its operations. It would be rather difficult to define who the <QUOTE>labouring classes</QUOTE> really are, and I am afraid that many lodgers sheltered by this society would hardly bear a strict examination into their claims as labourers. Without any wordy flourishes, the society is a clean, wholesome lodging-house company, providing decent accommodation for any <num value="1">one</num> who knocks at their doors, if he is not a costermonger, or a confirmed dweller in courts. No <num value="1">one</num> seems to touch the lowest of the low, or their putrid hiding-places, and the depths in education reached by ragged schools are not yet reached by philanthropists in providing model dwellings. 
<p>Our benevolent societies are all either too <pb id="p.221" n="221"> large-minded, or tied to the log of a rumbling title. We want a division of labour,--a large association of real workers, not talkers and givers --and a body of home missionaries who will tuck up their shirt-sleeves, and go out with brooms, shovels, pails, and whitewashing brushes. We want creeds of all kinds put on the shelf, for a short period, and a few years of <QUOTE>soap and water societies;</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>scrubbing-brush societies,</QUOTE> and such like combinations. We have heard a good deal lately about muscular Christianity, and if it is anything more than a mere name, a splendid field of action is open before it. In no part of the world,--not even in the remotest dens of savage wildernesses,--is there such a field for labour as in our London courts and alleys. Peel off the stucco at any point, and there is the mass of dirt, vice, and social degradation festering beneath. I have lived in it and amongst it ever since I could walk and talk, and I speak with some authority when I say that I know what it is. No <num value="1">one</num> has ever properly grappled with it, has ever thoroughly understood it, or perhaps <pb id="p.222" n="222"> tried to understand it. The attempts at reform have been mere pickings at the surface,--feeble, half-supported efforts to do good. The man only preached at, goes back to his den and rubs the lesson off his mind in a few minutes. The child only preached at, goes out of the school, puts its tongue in its cheek, throws a <QUOTE>handspring</QUOTE> in the mud, and forgets all it ever learnt in its domestic hell. Education, as I have said before, is something more than merely <QUOTE>sitting under</QUOTE> a preacher, or learning lessons out of a book. We all know what home influence is for good or evil, and here are <num value="150000">one hundred and fifty thousand</num> families living in dens that are worse than sewers. The most awful thing in. connexion with these people, is to find them utterly blind to their dirt and misery. Their senses are blunted by long familiarity, they cannot see the overcrowding, the mass of rotten filth that surrounds them; they cannot smell the stench; they are choked with dirt, and yet feel clean; and they slink up the foul back streets, and are satisfied with their condition.

<div2 type="chapter" n="12" id="c.12"><HEAD>Mistaken Charity.</HEAD>
 
<p>No art is so difficult as the art of charity. To give a man a something (except in money) that he really wants, or to organize a home for him that he will really prize, are things that are not done once in a <num value="100">hundred</num> years. 
<p>The rudest idea of the charitable refuge is the almshouse. It existed at the time when waggons did the journey to York in a week or <num value="10">ten</num> days, and when it was not safe to wander towards Charing Cross after dusk. There is a wonderful sameness about all buildings of the kind. They have a central hall with a clock and a bell; a number of small brick tenements projecting to the right; an equal number projecting to the left; a pump, a cabbage-garden at the back, an ornamental grass-plot (where the <pb id="p.225" n="225"> charity is rich) laid out in front; a statue of the founder, or a tablet to his memory; a dull uniformity; and an awful silence. Every room is like every other room, and every door is opposite some other door. How can the inmates of such a place be happy? Neither broken-down haberdashers, decayed Turkey merchants, nor needy frame-knitters are grateful for such refuges. They go to them, because beggars have no power to be choosers. They walk about, reflecting each other's pauperism; they constantly revolve round the same old ideas, and they moodily watch each other's decay. No matter how picturesque the general view of their building may appear; no matter how healthy or delightful may be the locality in which they are placed; no matter whether you call their institution by the name of college or almshouse; there is a mixture of the workhouse and the penitentiary in its constitution which it will never lose while a single inmate remains.<NOTE>This paragraph is taken mainly from an old article of mine in the <title>Daily News</title>.</NOTE>
 <pb id="p.226" n="226"> 
<p>If almshouses that are almost rural in their aspect are felt to be prisons, how much less attractive those dwarfed, dark, cottage-looking dens must be, that, through the changes of time, are now in the very heart of the City? You may meet with them at every turn;--in Moorgate, Cripplegate, Bishopsgate, and Southwark. Their founders never had any politico-economical idea of making them repulsive in order to check the growth of the poor. Their design and position were supposed to be faultless by those who founded them. From the day on which they were raised, to the present hour--a period perhaps, of more than <num value="300">three hundred</num> years,--their low rooms have never been without inmates. Sometimes they shelter a few stooping old men who creep about the paved yards, or peer through the railings at the gate; and sometimes a few withered old women who clean their cottage windows, brush their door-steps, and fetch water from the pump. These pensioners exist, like strange animals in a cage, and are placed at the road-side for idle, thoughtless <pb id="p.227" n="227"> passengers to gape at. The field or country lane of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num>, <num value="17">seventeenth</num>, or even eighteenth century, in which their original hermitages were built, has become a close street of busy warehouses, if not an alley of dirty hovels. The old pensioners find themselves in everybody's way; and everybody is in their way. Their air, and their light, are half blocked out by a law of metropolitan progress, and their poor lives are doubtless shortened by the accidents of their position. They live daily and hourly in a way that their benefactors never meant they should live in; and the boards and corporations who manage their funds are as well aware of this as most people. Too much respect is paid to the assumed, not the real, wishes of the dead; and no <num value="1">one</num> has courage enough to ask Parliament to remove these unfortunate almshouses. 
<p>In London and the outskirts there are at least a <num value="100">hundred</num> of these charitable refuges, and more than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3">third</num> of this number are jammed up in and about the city. There is <num value="1">one</num> row for the deserving poor-re-built in <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>-up a <pb id="p.228" n="228"> court in Moorgate Street. The houses are clean and comfortable, and the situation is not very confined, but the ground must be wasting away under such an unproductive class of buildings.<NOTE><CIT><QUOTE><title rend=caps>Value of Land in the City.</title>--In consequence of improvements being made in Newgate Street, Great Tower Street, and <num value="2">two</num> other places within the City, land to the amount of <measure value="2670l." type=currency><num value="2670">2,670</num>l.</measure>-of which sum <measure value="890l." type=currency><num value="890">890</num>l.</measure> (<num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3">third</num>) has been contributed by the Metropolitan Board of Works--will be given up to the public.

The deserving poor in each of these <num value="6">six</num> houses, receive now about <num value="6">six</num> or <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">seven</num> shillings</measure> a week each; but if the freehold was sold, offices and warehouses would rise upon the spot, and every dependant of this charity would be benefited for ever and ever. In Great St. Helen's, Bishopsgate, there is another asylum, known as Judd's, founded in <datestruct value="1555--"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct>, and rebuilt in <datestruct value="1729--"><year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct>. It shelters <num value="6">six</num> poor men who have each <num value="2">two</num> rooms and <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure> a week, and who are doubtless very happy. Neither of these places can be strictly called almshouses; the <num value="1">first</num> being an ordinary row of small dwellings, and the last <pb id="p.229" n="229"> a large, old-fashioned mansion. The rooms now occupied by each of these <num value="6">six</num> poor men, would fetch about <measure value="30l." type=currency><num value="30">thirty</num> pounds</measure> a year if let out as offices, and a building might be raised on the ground occupied by this old refuge, that would pay a much higher rental. 
<p>It is not necessary to describe even half-a-dozen of these places, nor to look into each deed under which they were founded, to know that their removal would benefit the charities they represent, and the people at present living in them. Let any <num value="1">one</num>, in passing over London Bridge, towards Southwark, look down upon a squat row of cottages lying between St. Saviour's Church and the wharf warehouses of Messrs. Humphrey and others. These almshouses were built in the last century by Mrs. Shaw Overman, for <num value="8">eight</num> poor women. Each house contains only <num value="1">one</num> room on the ground floor, and the residents have <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure> a week each. New London Bridge and its approaches from the south have raised a noisy, ever-crowded roadway high above their heads, and the wharf buildings, Bridge <pb id="p.230" n="230"> House hotel, and other places have towered up round them, until they seem now to live at the bottom of a deep brick well. They are evidently standing in the way of business very much against their will, for they have no particular associations with Southwark at the waterside. They are called the <QUOTE>witches,</QUOTE> by costermongers and boatmen, and would doubtless be very glad if they were able to choose another lodging. Their cottages look like mushrooms by the side of the lofty, yellow warehouses; and huge packages seem always hanging over them at the end of cranes, threatening to fall and crush them. If the ground these ill-placed refuges stand upon were sold to the building genii of the neighbourhood, the <num value="8">eight</num> old ladies who depend upon Mrs. Overman's charity now, and those who may have to depend upon it in the future, might retire to any lodging coming within their means, secure in an income doubled if not trebled. 
<p>This is the case with many London almshouses; and every hour that is lost in altering <pb id="p.231" n="231"> it according to the dictates of business, common sense, and humanity, is so much wrong inflicted upon the poor, helpless inmates, in opposition to the real wishes of those who founded these charities. Let each knot of dependants be boldly pensioned off, with liberty to go where they like, to live where they like, and to spend their money as they like. This is real charity, and while it will reform old almshouses--the gifts of past philanthropists--it will set a healthy example before the philanthropists of the future. <pb id="p.232" n="232"> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="13" id="c.13"><HEAD>Conclusion.</HEAD>
 
<p>Weeks spent in Westminster, near the Abbey, would only multiply these experiences; and weeks spent in and about Whitechapel, St. George's in the East, Bethnal Green and Shoreditch, Clerkenwell, St. Pancras, Bermondsey, Southwark, Lambeth, <QUOTE>over the water</QUOTE> generally, and Marylebone, would certainly produce a like result. Wherever you sink a shaft--whether in the centre or the outskirts--and penetrate with a good guide, perseverance, and fair local knowledge, you will find endless veins of social degradation. In all my journeys through the holes and corners of London I have found a terrible sameness--little more than <num value="1">one</num> thing--a dead level of misery, crime, vice, dirt, and rags. I have had but <num value="1">one</num> story to tell, and I have told it as faithfully as it <pb id="p.233" n="233"> could well be told. The scale upon which my chapters have been unavoidably planned has imposed a treatment rather broad and superficial, and a rather arbitrary arrangement of districts. I have kept to certain distinct patches of London whose titles were familiar to the public, and by this means, when a strict description of parochial boundaries was out of the question, I have laboured to show upon what locality I stood. I have passed by many holes and corners in Fleet Street, the Strand, Chancery Lane, Holborn,<NOTE>The Earl of Shaftesbury made the following remarks in the House of Lords, <datestruct VALUE="1861-02-28"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1861>1861</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>In <num value="8">eight</num> small courts,</QUOTE> he said, <QUOTE>off Holborn Hill, he found <num value="62">sixty-two</num> houses, <num value="314">three hundred and fourteen</num> rooms, of the average size of <num value="8">eight</num> feet by <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="7">seven</num> by <num value="9">nine</num>. In these rooms lived <num value="1479">one thousand four hundred and seventy-nine</num> persons. It was impossible to imagine the physical and moral evil which resulted from these circumstances, or to describe the fearful effects on the population. But he might say that there were adults of both sexes living together in the same room, in which every social necessity, every domestic act, must be performed; that there were not only adults of both sexes living in the same room, but adult sons sleeping with their mothers, and brothers and sisters very commonly sleeping in the same bed. He was stating what he knew to be the truth when he said that incestuous crime was frightfully common--common to the greatest possible extent within the range of these courts.</QUOTE> 
</NOTE> Gray's-inn Lane, <pb id="p.234" n="234"> and other quarters that are dirty, ill-constructed, and overcrowded enough to merit a place in the catalogue. At present the melancholy list is full. I shall now endeavour to deal with a few of the social questions arising out of my survey, and shall then hold my peace. 
<p>Setting aside the criminal population of London, and that small number of the London industrious poor who struggle against the degrading influences of the neighbourhoods in which they are mostly compelled to live, we shall find at least <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3">third</num> of our <num value="3">three</num> millions of human beings in the metropolis housed in filthy, ill-constructed courts and alleys, or crowding in unwholesome layers, <num value="1">one</num> over the other, in old houses and confined rooms. The life they lead daily and hourly is full of debasing lessons. Decency is lost where large families of all ages and of both sexes are accustomed to live in <num value="1">one</num> apartment, and habits are engendered which last for generations. This carelessness about comforts and conveniences acts upon landlords. There is little <pb id="p.235" n="235"> demand for pure, wholesome, well-constructed dwellings, and they are not supplied. The court and alley property in and about London, which is a disgrace to a city of enterprise and civilization, is in most cases up to the level of its consumers. A low, wretched standard of living makes the poor huddle together in such places, without any general desire to improve them. Model lodging-houses, if built in advance of a general demand for such superior dwellings, would not raise the tenants to the level of the building, but would drag the building down to the level of the tenants. I think it was the Duke of Bedford who built a number of superior <num value="3">three</num>-roomed cottages on his estate, because he disliked to see his labourers huddled together in <num value="1">one</num> room. The habit of living in <num value="1">one</num> room, however, was too strong for the reformer, and in a few months each cottage was filled with <num value="3">three</num> separate families, the original tenant having sub-let what he considered his spare space. The records of philanthropy could supply many more discouraging anecdotes, but there is too much reservation on <pb id="p.236" n="236"> such points. No country in the world spends so much money in charity as England--no country is taxed for benevolent purposes to anything like the same extent.<NOTE><p>Our national poor-rate is estimated at <num value="6">six</num> milions sterling per annum. It has also been calculated that another million a year is devoted to charitable purposes, and about an equal amount of benevolent permanent resources is derived from the liberality of former generations. Our national paupers are estimated at <num value="1">one</num> million. 
<p>A parliamentary return, moved for by Mr. Villiers, and published <datestruct VALUE="1861-02-12"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=12>12</day>, <year reg=1861>1861</year></datestruct>, shows that in England and Wales there are <num value="7432587">7,432,587</num> persons rated to the poor rate; the gross estimated rental at Lady Day, <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>, was <measure value="31315595l." type=currency><num value="31315595">31,315,595</num>l.</measure>; the <pb n="p.237"> rateable value at Lady Day, <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>, was <measure value="25737056l." type=currency><num value="25737056">25,737,056</num>l.</measure>; and the number of houses rated to the relief of the poor, was <num value="1400237">1,400,237</num>. 
</NOTE> In London alone there is every conceivable form of institution for the relief of the sick, the infirm, and the specially afflicted. Squat rows of almshouses meet us, as I have just said, at every turn, nestling in the very heart of the city and its outlets. Nearly a million of <QUOTE>cases</QUOTE> receive free medical advice and assistance in London alone every year. The hat is always going round. The <num value="1">first</num> stone of some benevolent building is always being laid. We dine, we sing, we act, we make speeches in aid of the funds of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> institutions; we are never tired of doing what we consider good. <pb id="p.237" n="237"> Casinos, harmonious pot-houses, and pugilistic exhibitions,<NOTE><p><QUOTE rend=blockquote><emph>Pugilistic Benefit for the Distressed Coventry Weavers</emph>.--The announced pugilistic demonstration in aid of the funds for this charitable purpose took place on Monday evening, <datestruct VALUE="1861-01-28"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1861>1861</year></datestruct>, at the National baths, Westminster Road. The benefit was to all intents and purposes  <Q>a bumper,</Q>  and this must be highly gratifying to those members of the P.R. who had taken so much interest in carrying out this charitable gathering. The spacious building was crowded in every part. Phil Benjamins was the M.C., and was assisted in the discharge of his duties by Jemmy Shaw, with the most praiseworthy zeal. The sports opened with the performance of Professor Thomas, and then came the sparring, the bouts, which followed in admirable time, being between the following men, viz:--Dillon and Plantagenet Green, George Crockett and Dan Collins, Job Cobley and Travers, Ben Caunt and Jem Ward, Bos Tyler and Harry Brunton, Bob Brettle (who came expressly from Birmingham, with his belt and cups,) and Mike Madden, Jerry Noon and Alec Keene, W. Shaw and Young Reed, Tom Paddock and Tom King. Sam Hurst, the champion, who, from lameness, was unable to spar, came on the stage and exhibited the belt for which he and Tom Paddock had contended. Then followed Harry Broome, the ex-champion of England, and Harry Orme; but, before the bout between these distinguished members of the ring took place, Broome, in a neat speech, returned thanks on behalf of the <pb n="p.238"> committee for the liberal manner in which they had been supported in their charitable undertaking. Then came a spar between George Brown and Jemmy Welsh, Harris and Hicks being the next exhibitors, and last, though not least, was the wind--up between Nat Langham and Jem Mace, the last-named man exhibiting his belt. In addition to these leading men there were many others present who were anxious to set-to, but had not the opportunity. Tom Sayers was unable to attend, nor did Lynch, the American, put in an appearance to spar with Harrington. Broome, in his speech, announced that <measure value="197l." type=currency><num value="197">197</num>l.</measure> had been taken in money at the doors, this being irrespective of money that will have to be accounted for by tickets sold, so that the whole affair, in a pecuniary view, was eminently successful.</QUOTE>

</NOTE> catch the benevolent infection and work like mill-horses to aid noisy soup-kitchens. I can only wonder that prostitution is not moved to be <pb id="p.238" n="238"> charitable, and that the mangy Haymarket does not give up a few nights' earnings every winter for the benefit of the poor. The impulsive virtues flourish even upon dunghills, and people bestow with <num value="1">one</num> hand while they are compelled to receive with the other. Paupers unite in teapot testimonials to matrons and overseers, which they purchase out of the money saved from <pb id="p.239" n="239"> tobacco and snuff. The hard-hearted man, the cold-blooded political economist, the hunks, the gripe--all, are empty dreams. Business is business in every hole and corner, and no trade will ever be conducted upon sentimental principles; but, after the shop shutters are put up, the ledger is posted, and the till money is counted, the large heart begins to do its work. We are certainly not suffering from too little heart in our social system, but perhaps from too much. The head, after all, is not the worst guide in works of charity, as those men find who have to analyze results. Benevolent people who act from impulse rather than reflection--warm-hearted, open-handed givers--are hourly pained by seeing their gifts misapplied, or their institutions fattening the class whom they were never intended to benefit. Model lodging-houses, designed to work good, but planted in uncongenial soil, become occupied by tenants, as I have just shown, who require no assistance from a sentimental standard of rent, and the <QUOTE>swinish multitude</QUOTE> are still left wallowing in their blind alleys. Soup-kitchens, <pb id="p.240" n="240"> like free theatres, attract the wandering tribes of London--open their doors without any effectual check or inquiry, dispense food, as in Spitalfields, to the extent of <measure value="30000l." type=currency><num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> pounds</measure> sterling and find, after all, that they have fed the wrong men. Hospitals, asylums, charity schools, and other forms of permanent out-door relief, are worm-eaten by imposition, and yet they flourish. They stand up as monuments for foreigners to gaze at, and are, at the same time, our glory and our shame. They show a class on <num value="1">one</num> hand always ready to give, and they show another class--low, wanting in self-reliance and self-respect, demoralized by much charity--always ready to receive. The seeds of the old lavish poor-law have borne bitter fruit, and a working-class has grown up who look to a parish pension as the honourable reward of age. The simplest and cheapest forms of insurance are neglected; the usurious loan offices, whose thousands of branches spread into every district, are welcomed as friends; early reckless marriages are contracted--marriages, as I have said before, that are as much a <pb id="p.241" n="241"> <QUOTE>dissipation</QUOTE> as gin-drinking, or any other abomination,--children are produced without thought, set upon their feet without clothing, taught to walk, turned into the street without food or education, and left to the ragged school, the charitable public, or the devil. Homes for such outcasts spring up on all sides; large-hearted men and women rush forward to help the neglected; and the class is sometimes unfortunately increased by the very efforts made to relieve it. 
<p>I am grieved to have to write like this of honest labourers--of men who ought to do their work, keep homes over their heads that are something better than dog-kennels or pigsties, and shrink from a gift as if it were a wound. They increase and multiply, and all for what? To become paupers; to glut the labour market; to keep their wages down at starvation point, to swell the profits of capital. They look to everyone to relieve them, but make few efforts to relieve themselves. The most perfect poor-law; the most perfect administration of that poor-law; the most lavish charity can do nothing <pb id="p.242" n="242"> for them compared to the wonders of self-help. Let them defer their marriages for <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> years, and they will turn their backs on strikes and starvation. My sympathies are with them in any well-considered scheme to benefit their condition. I have lived amongst them and know their ways; I willingly acknowledge their many virtues, their generosity, their endurance under suffering, but I want to see them with a little more pride. They may not always beg themselves, but they make their wives and families beg for them. The disgrace is theirs where the poor, pinched women in scanty clothes are sent to crowd round the parsonage-door, or to hold out the well-thumbed, creased petitions in their thin, bloodless hands. 
<p>The labour thrown upon the working clergy in the lowest districts by this want of self-reliance on the part of the industrious poor is something enormous. Their houses become tailors'-shops, eating-houses, dispensaries, banks, schools, sanitary committee-rooms--everything but clerical sanctuaries. The old classic, the <pb id="p.243" n="243"> pet divine, are thrown on <num value="1">one</num> side or forgotten; and to walk all day in muddy boots, to give out tickets and read letters, to return home at uncertain hours with grubby hands, and to spend the evening in making up parochial accounts is their daily and hourly task. They see distress that they cannot relieve; they know its cause, and yet they have not the heart to reprove it; they toil and beg for their local charities, often with little effect, and sometimes eat into their own scanty incomes rather than neglect their dependants. The poor-law, which, if properly constructed, ought to relieve them of this ceaseless, disheartening drudgery, is only a millstone round their necks. It starts with a proper determination to check pauperism in every possible way, but it never succeeds in carrying out its object. It breaks down, as it has broken down this winter--not so much from glaring faults in its individual administrators, as from the make-believe character of its system. Its plan is to get rid of the poor--to pass them on-to toss them from hand to hand, and not to grapple <pb id="p.244" n="244"> with them. It makes all the show, spends much of the money, and leaves other people to do the work. A pauper is often disposed of by being told to go farther; but he sometimes dies in the streets, and creates a public scandal.<NOTE>On Friday morning, <datestruct VALUE="1861-01-11"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=11>11</day>, <year reg=1861>1861</year></datestruct>, Mr. Carter received information of the awfully sudden death of a man in Manor Street, Clapham. The deceased, with <num value="4">four</num> other men, were walking through the streets, in consequence of the frost stopping their work as navigators, soliciting the contributions of the charitable to relieve their destitution. The dead man, who was singing in the road with the others, suddenly staggered and fell. A surgeon stated that death was caused by cold and hunger, and the poor man's co-mates said that they had been <num value="2">two</num> days without food.</NOTE> The workhouse doors may be closed, the lights may be put out, the master may be in bed; but other doors are open, other lights are burning, other people are stirring. The workhouse--the ratepayers themselves-become receivers of out-door relief when the starving poor are thus thrown upon stray charity. 
<p>The question of an equalization of poor-rates generally springs up when the condition of the poor is examined; and those who have advocated this change in the plan of rating with the greatest <pb id="p.245" n="245"> care and ability have sometimes mistaken the effect it would produce upon the pauper population. It would not reform their condition; it would not remedy the evils under which they suffer; it would not make them more decent, more moral, more independent; it would not drain off superabundant labour from overstocked markets. It would make <num value="1">one</num> portion of the poor--the great majority--more comfortable; and it would make another portion, the minority, less comfortable. As a measure of justice it would deal principally with property, and would not check pauperism in the slightest degree. We should get rid of glaring inequalities in assessment, and all landlords would be reduced to <num value="1">one</num> level of taxation. Companies that have sucked up a parish--like the Bank of England, which stands, I believe, on the whole of St. Christopher-le-Stock--would not be their own assessors, their own guardians, their own relieving officers, paying sums that are ridiculously small when contrasted with other assessments. We should get rid of <num value="1">one</num> notorious difficulty in the way of <QUOTE>metropolitan <pb id="p.246" n="246"> improvements.</QUOTE> New streets might then be cut without any fear that capitalists would hesitate to provide houses for the working classes in other districts, because checked by the poor-rates. The pauper in the west, with his <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure> a week and his loaf of bread, would have to divide his dole with the pauper in the east, who gets nothing but a loaf and a shilling aweek, but that would be all. The great problem of how to check pauperism without cruelty or neglect would still be unsolved. 
<p>Attempts have been made to improve the physical condition of the poor by what is called <QUOTE>sanitary reform.</QUOTE> Like all meddling legislation this may do as much harm as good. If certain kitchens are condemned as not being fit for human dwelling-places, the rents in that particular district are raised, and this practically by the order of the local officer of health. If certain rooms in a house are closed according to law, and the dwelling accommodation of the district is not stretched in another direction, the rooms that are left have the same value as all the <pb id="p.247" n="247"> rooms in the house had before. The tenants, not the landlord, are the sufferers by this enforced change, and they are compelled to huddle more closely together, and to pay an increased rent. It seems an awful thing that a felon in prison should have <num value="1000">one thousand</num> cubic feet of breathing space, while many poor working--people in the most overcrowded districts have not more than <num value="200">two hundred</num> cubic feet of air in their rooms for each person; but the <num value="1">first</num> is paid for and given out of the taxes, and the <num value="2">second</num> has to be worked for and bought. If the Metropolis Local Management Acts, or any other sanatory Acts, compel the poor, by inspection, to purchase <num value="500">five hundred</num> cubic feet of air for each member of their families, they either compel them to better their condition, or to pinch their half-empty stomachs for the sake of the public health. I am afraid that this attempt to improve the poor by Act of Parliament is as unsound in principle as it is often mischievous in effect. 
<p>The educational agencies at work upon the rising generation may do something to raise the <pb id="p.248" n="248"> moral tone and habits of those who will be men and women in <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> years' time; but the present generation, the idle and industrious poor who have passed the age of manhood, I am afraid must be given up. Their habits are formed; they are beyond the influence of schools or classes, and their ambition can only be excited on behalf of their children. Philanthropy can do no harm and much good by devoting all its energies to the young, and the more it improves their minds and morals the more chance is there that they will aim at a higher standard of living.<NOTE>The London ragged schools, I believe, number <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num>, containing <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> children. The unpaid teachers at these schools amount to <num value="2000">two thousand</num>.

<div2 type="chapter" n="15" id="c.15"><HEAD>A Medical Opinion. 
<LB>Dr. Conway Evans's Reports on the Strand District, London. <datestruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct>.</HEAD>
 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>The manner in which parts of the district are crammed with people is <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest of its evils which have to be mitigated. The importance of this matter was dwelt upon in my <num value="1">first</num> annual report, in which it was shown that in <num value="1">one</num> of the parishes of this district <hi rend=italics>at least <num value="581">581</num> persons are packed upon every acre of its surface</hi>.<NOTE>St. Clement Danes.</NOTE> The evil consequences of this overcrowding are manifold; into a discussion of all of them the limits of this report do not permit me to enter: some of them, however, must be briefly adverted to. 
<p>By this state of overcrowding the duration of life generally is shortened and health impaired; and these effects, though manifest when looked for, as will be presently shown, in persons of adult age, are far more readily discoverable in the case of infants and young children, to the high death-rate of which class your attention was directed on a former occasion. But it is not merely that so many of the children born in the district die at an early age--<num value="66">66</num> infants of the age of <num value="1">one</num> year and under, having died out of every <num value="10000">10,000</num> persons residing in the district during the past year--but it is that very many of those children, who do not speedily fall victims to the circumstances by which they are surrounded, grow up weakly and scrofulous, and sooner or later throng the out-patient rooms of the public hospitals and dispensaries, or come under the care of the private medical practitioner, or the parochial <pb id="p.255" n="255"> surgeon, suffering from <num value="1">one</num> or other forms of <hi rend=italics>tubercular</hi>
disease. The loss of health thus induced is in the case of adults in some respects more costly to the community at large than that resulting from <hi rend=italics>fever</hi>, as it sooner or later involves, not a <hi rend=italics>temporary</hi>, but <hi rend=italics>permanent</hi> inability to labour, until at length death steps in and relieves the public of the expense thus thrown upon it. 
<p>But the evil consequences of overcrowding are not limited to the impairment of health, or even to the destruction of life, either in the manner referred to or by favouring the occurrence and spread of disease; but by its action not only are the bodily powers prostrated and sapped, but the moral life is also degraded and debased; and ignorance, indecency, immorality, intemperance, prostitution, and crime, are directly or indirectly fostered and induced. The mode in which prostitution originates in overcrowding is but too frequently illustrated in this densely peopled district; indeed, cases occasionally come under my observation in which this vice cannot but be regarded as the necessary and inevitable result of the indiscriminate manner in which the sexes are huddled together. 
<p>To this subject of overcrowding your earnest attention is solicited, for it is without doubt the most important, and at the same time the most difficult, with which you are called upon to deal; and sooner or later it must be dealt with. Houses and streets may be drained most perfectly; the district may be paved and lighted in such a manner as to excite the jealous envy of other local authorities; new thoroughfares may be constructed, and every house in the district furnished with a constant supply of pure water; the Thames may be embanked, <pb id="p.256" n="256"> and all entrance of sewage into that river intercepted; but so long as <num value="20">twenty</num>, <num value="30">thirty</num>, or even <num value="40">forty</num> individuals are permitted--it might almost be said compelled-to reside in houses originally built for the accommodation of a single family or at most of <num value="2">two</num> families, so long will the evils pointed out in regard of health, of ignorance, of indecency, immorality, intemperance, prostitution, and crime continue to exist unchecked. So long as no kind of privacy whatever can be obtained even by the individual members of a single family; so long as brothers and sisters, as well children as adults, are obliged to live, sleep, and perform the offices of nature in the same room with their parents, and it may be with other relatives, or possibly with strangers; and so long as the amount of air<NOTE><QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>In the Pentonville Prison the inmate of each cell is supplied with between <num value="800">800</num> and <num value="900">900</num> cubic feet of air, and means are employed for renewing this every <num value="16">sixteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> minutes.

<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Our population has increased to nearly <num value="10000">10,000</num>, and I regret to say that some of my private friends, who were accustomed to give their half-crowns at our annual collections at the church, have been removed from us by death; and now we have no <num value="1">one</num> residing in the district but those who, out of their deep poverty, cast in their mites into the treasury. Our houses are, for the most part, let out in lodgings, and several families reside in <num value="1">one</num> house. 
<p>Our visitors have sought out and found many a deserving family reduced to the lowest extremity of want, and yet, with the good old English feeling--ashamed to beg, and considering it degrading to ask parochial relief.</QUOTE>
 
<div4 type=subsection><HEAD>From the Rev. Theophilus Saulez, of All Saints, Islington.</HEAD>
 
<p><QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, enclosing a cheque for <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">50</num>l.</measure>, for which I am exceedingly obliged, as the poverty of my district at this moment is most deplorable. The <pb id="p.258" n="258"> terrible distress occasioned by want of work, and the refusal of the parish authorities to give any out-door relief, is great; indeed, beyond the conception of English hearts. There are instances, in my district, of families having parted with every piece of furniture, and almost every rag of clothes, to enable them to pay their rent, and thus not break up the family circle by going into the workhouse. It is quite impossible for us to maintain these families, and the parish will not relieve them, and therefore their sufferings from hunger and cold are most distressing. 
<p>All those with whom we are acquainted, whether Roman Catholics, Dissenters, or Churchmen, if in distress, we assist so far as our means will allow.</QUOTE>

<p><QUOTE rend=blockquote>The population of the parish is <num value="9000">9,000</num>, and of this number at least <num value="5000">5,000</num> are poor; the rest are far from wealthy-the greater number being clerks in offices, &amp;c. with very limited incomes. There is no endowment for any purpose whatever; and when I mention that we have to raise in the parish (to say nothing of the support of the incumbent) the annual expenses of public worship, support of schools (a heavy rent having to be paid for school-buildings), Mother and Infant Society, Provident Fund, Clothing Club, and other charitable purposes, the Committee will readily understand how valuable is their grant, and how much our means of usefulness would be diminished by its withdrawal.</QUOTE>

It has come in most opportunely, for I grieve to say that I hear of fresh cases of great poverty daily.

I find its influence <hi rend=italics>everywhere.</hi> And what should I do without such assistance as that so cheerfully afforded by your excellent society?

<p><QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>This season has been a trying <num value="1">one</num> to our poor. We have been much called upon, and obliged to work very hard. In the <num value="1">first</num> place, the results of the strike were felt; for as soon as the cold weather came, we found that the women and children were thinly and poorly clad, and they had saved nothing. Also we have had a large amount of sickness, and more deaths than I have witnessed for many years. But amidst all this distress and woe, our visitors have done good and Christian work; and I may say, that the troubles of our poor have been cheered and hallowed to them, and to ourselves, by the mercy and help conveyed, and the happiness derived, from the sacred interchange of kindness and gratitude. If these poor districts were left unassisted, there would be a frightful amount of suffering.</QUOTE>

<p>The above letters are corroborated by many others of similar import received from the parochial clergy during the past year (<datestruct value="1859"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>); and they help to show that the metropolitan distress of <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>-<num value="61">61</num> was not so very <QUOTE>exceptional.</QUOTE> 
<p>I give the schedule of grants of this association, not because the amount it distributes is very large, compared with the whole charities of London, but because the details of distribution show the wide extent of ragged London. <pb id="p.260" n="260">

<p><hi rend=italics>To the Editor of <title>The Penny Newsman</title>.</hi>
Sir,--As <num value="1">one</num> of the working-class I beg to offer my thanks to <QUOTE>Scrutinizer,</QUOTE> for his sympathy and able reply to the charge of improvidence which has been made against us; and I hope I shall not presume too much by offering a few remarks thereon. That many of us indulge in strong drink must be admitted, but there are also many who take it in moderation, as a necessary article of support during the hours of toil; and I would advise all who cannot use it as a blessing to abstain from making it a curse. In reference to our friend's expenditure of <measure value="18s." type=currency><num value="18">18</num>s.</measure> per week for <num value="3">three</num> persons, I think all must admit there is no extravagance in it. But I cannot take <measure value="18s." type=currency><num value="18">18</num>s.</measure> a week as an average for the labouring class. If we look at the docks we find that <measure value="15s." type=currency><num value="15">15</num>s.</measure> is the price for extra men, in Government yards <measure value="13s." type=currency><num value="13">13</num>s.</measure>, and some others still less. Now, the number of working-men having <hi rend=italics>no</hi> children to provide for is indeed extremely limited; on the other hand, I think the average number in family given by your correspondent is too low. I think <hi rend=italics><num value="4">four</num></hi> children might be set down, on which to base the calculation of cost; therefore there will be <num value="6">six</num> to provide for now. I think I may say without fear of contradiction that to lay out <measure value="18s." type=currency><num value="18">18</num>s.</measure> in the best way for that number, parents will find that they are not so well fed as the inmates of a poorhouse, but they have liberty, and are free born Englishmen, which is our boast. I will now glance at the mechanic--to which class I belong--and having reared a family in London, always found some difficulty in providing by <pb id="p.283" n="283"> the produce of my labour for the necessaries requisite to produce comfort. From my experience I believe the wages paid in London to the working class generally is quite equal to any town in the kingdom, and I know it is better than in some. Now we must take it for granted that all mechanics in London do not receive the large wages spoken of, for I should say the majority receive less, and some much less; therefore I will suppose that <measure value="1l." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>l.</measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> will be something like an average, and I will endeavour to provide for a man, his wife, and <num value="4">four</num> children, great and small, as they may be, in what I consider a plain way, without much luxury. Beer is said by some to be a luxury, and a ruinous <num value="1">one</num>; so it is, when taken in excess, but I think it useful, and I would ask anyone who knows anything of a smith's shop, a shipyard, and many other trades, if <num value="2">two</num> pints of beer per day during the hours of toil is not very acceptable. Some trades, perhaps, may do with half that quantity; I will, therefore, take the half quantity in my reckoning of expenditure, as follows:--

<div4 type=subsection><HEAD>The Working Man and his <QUOTE>Extravagance.</QUOTE> </HEAD>
 
<p><hi rend=italics>To the Editor of <QUOTE>The Penny Newsman.</QUOTE> </hi>
SIR,--The liberal tone of feeling expressed in the leaders of the <title>Penny Newsman</title> induces me to hope a few plain, simple expressions of my opinion may meet with insertion in the next number. My position for the past <num value="30">thirty</num> years has been that of a superintendent and manager of works in various parts of the kingdom, and in the metropolis as well; and I have in that time had ample opportunities of seeing and studying the habits, wants, and feelings of some thousands of mechanics and <pb id="p.285" n="285"> labourers with whom I have been mixed up, and no man can (I humbly, but firmly, state) know more of their real points and bearings than myself; but I have heard and read so many statements of late (particularly in the past severe winter) as to the <QUOTE>improvidence, waste, and extravagance of the working men and labourers in the disposal of their large wages,</QUOTE> that I felt myself bound to say the charge is generally false and groundless as a whole; and I assert that some of those statements have been made by clergymen and others, who evidently wrote for mere writing sake, and they have done a serious injury to themselves as clergymen by misstating the causes of the depression of the working classes. I will endeavour to point out what is the real and positive facts of the case. In the <num value="1">first</num> place, the working men are not receiving large wages, but just barely sufficient, with the most scraping and rigid economy, to make their wages last out the weekthat is, if they have, as is mostly the case, a wife and children to support besides themselves. That single men, who are prudent and cautious, may put by a something in the <QUOTE>savings'-bank,</QUOTE> whilst others may patronize the beer-house and gin-shop, whose tastes are depraved, I will admit; but, as a general rule, the husband and father will be always (or nearly so) found in his home, where every penny of his hard earnings will be best spent; but there are many cases where the family of children are large, and the pressure for maintenance of them is so heavy, that the wife is often obliged to leave her own home to go out charing-that is, cleaning other persons' homes-whilst her own home and her children are neglected and filthy. Husband <pb id="p.286" n="286"> and wife return home together at night tired out with the day's work, and often several miles' walk after it, and, perhaps, wet through. A cheerless, cold, and uncomfortable home presents itself; that home, in most cases a single room, but at the best <num value="2">two</num> rooms, are all they have. The children are hastily fed on a few scrap victuals, and put to bed, whilst the husband, and sometimes the wife as well, adjourn to a well-warmed and lighted tap-room, where they seek together a little temporary enjoyment or comfort which cannot be found in their own cheerless home; for it is not sufficiently considered that the working men, especially in the metropolis, have not a large range of rooms to choose for residence in, but are positively obliged to settle down and nestle in such localities as will suit their slender means. Let me ask the question--how many hundreds of mechanics and labourers, with their wives and families, are huddled together within an area of less than a quarter of a mile of the printing-offices of the <hi rend=italics>Penny Newsman</hi>, whose homes are sickening to look on, much worse, then, must it be to be compelled, as the occupants are, to exist in them from year's end to year's end? That, and no other, is their choice at present, for they must be within a reasonable distance of their workshops or factories, and if they are too far off from their work their pockets must be affected by the increased expenditure of getting to and from their work. Give the poor working-men a fair chance of having a decent home, and the generality of them will avail themselves of its comforts, and society be benefited by their having a cheaper supply of room, fresh air, and good water for their homes. It is a positive mockery <pb id="p.287" n="287"> to expect a labouring man to be what is called provident under his present circumstances. I will take a labouring man obtaining eighteen shillings per week all the year round, with no sickness, or loss of work, or stoppage of work. Now, I know he may possibly, with a wife and child, contrive to make his money last out on the following scale,<NOTE><p>

<p><hi rend=italics>To the Editor of <QUOTE>Lloyd's Newspaper.</QUOTE> </hi>
SIR,--In a leading article, with the above heading, in your paper last week, you appeal to capitalists to employ some portion of their money in creating joint-stock companies to erect habitable dwellings for the poor. With the general tenor of your remarks I most cordially agree, but I think that the appeal will be much more readily answered, and the beneficial effects derivable therefrom incalculably superior, were it directed to the poor. The skilled artisan, the ordinary mechanic, and the common labourer are the men to whom I would apply for the funds to build decent homes for themselves and their class, and who will most readily do it. Startling as the proposition may seem that the poor shall become the bankers of the poor; unsound in theory and impossible in practice as, at <num value="1">first</num> sight, many may consider it to be, attention to the following statement will show them that such is by no means the case. 
<p>About the year <datestruct value="1844"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct> an <hi rend=italics>outre</hi> idea entered the heads of some dozen unemployed, half-starved Lancashire weavers: they resolved to improve their condition; without money and without friends, with no helping hand stretched out to them, not even a kindly word to cheer them on, but with perseverance and honesty as their guide, they would start a business on entirely new principles, and become the pioneers in a new science. <QUOTE>We will find our own money, and stand our own friends,</QUOTE> said they, and most nobly they did so. 
<p>By subscribing <measure value="2d." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>d.</measure> a week, they raised, in shares of <measure value="1l." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>l.</measure> each, about <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>l.</measure>; with this they commenced business. Their premises were so humble, and the stock <pb id="p.289" n="289"> inside so limited, that no <num value="1">one</num> had moral courage enough to take down the shutters when at last the opening day came--they cast lots for it. A tradesman in the town having heard of the threatened opposition, came to see what kind of an appearance they put in to commence with, and went away joyfully declaring that he could <QUOTE>wheel all the lot away in a barrow,</QUOTE> and prognosticating a speedy <QUOTE>shut up.</QUOTE> However, the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers' Society (such was its name) is in existence at the present moment, and the balance-sheet for the September quarter, <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct> (the account for the quarter just ended has not come to hand at the time I write), shows the following results:--The receipts are <measure value="37816l." type=currency><num value="37816">37,816</num>l.</measure> (exceeding <measure value="140000l." type=currency><num value="140000">140,000</num>l.</measure> a year); capital in hand, <measure value="34525l." type=currency><num value="34525">34,525</num>l.</measure>; profit, after paying all expenses, setting aside <measure value="107l." type=currency><num value="107">107</num>l.</measure> for educational purposes, giving <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>l.</measure> to the town infirmary, and <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>l.</measure> to the surgeon, is <measure value="4342l." type=currency><num value="4342">4,342</num>l.</measure> Out of the profits, <num value="5">five</num> per cent. goes to the shareholders on their paid--up capital, and the residue is divided among the customers in proportion to the amount they have spent at the shop during the quarter--an exact account of which is kept.<NOTE>Contrast these profits with those of the benevolent lodginghouse societies.</NOTE> They commenced as general dealers only--they now sell everything that is wanted to eat, drink, wear, or use in any station of life. The works are rapidly increasing, and the advantage to the town is. incalculable. Impelled by their example, and encouraged by their success, <num value="200">200</num> co-operative stores have sprung into existence in the north, representing capital amounting to <measure value="5000000l." type=currency><num value="5000000">5,000,000</num>l.</measure> Verily, this is <QUOTE>Philanthropy that Pays.</QUOTE> <pb id="p.290" n="290"> 
<p>Some short time back I called attention to these facts in the columns of a morning contemporary (<title>Daily Telegraph</title>), and asked how it was that London was so much behind the north; the <title>Era</title>, referring to my remarks, said I was in error in asserting that this movement was not progressing here, and instanced the National Co-operative store in the Euston-road, with several branches in London. I have not had time to inquire much about it yet, but have seen their balancesheet for the last quarter, and affairs stand thus:-- Number of shareholders, <num value="2400">2,400</num>; capital in hand, <measure value="2953l." type=currency><num value="2953">2,953</num>l.</measure>; business done, <measure value="4978l." type=currency><num value="4978">4,978</num>l.</measure>; which, considering the society did not open until March last, is most astonishing. 
<p>Then why not form co-operative building societies? I believe this would find more favour among the people, when it once came to be understood. It would teach the poor a valuable lesson, that if they want to improve their condition it must be by their own organized exertions. If they want anything done they must do it themselves, for other help there is none. It would leave no room for the cant of the professional philanthropist, and save the working classes from the ostentatious parade and humiliating patronage of their <QUOTE>kind friends.</QUOTE> 
<p>Should you deem this worthy of notice I shall be happy to forward you some further particulars respecting the management and working of co-operative societies generally.

<div3 type=section id="c.15.8"><HEAD>The East End Incumbent on London Poor Rates.</HEAD>
 
<p>This is an abridgement of the Rev. G. H. McGill's forcible pamphlet upon London Poor Rates, published in <datestruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct>. With a few alterations it might have been published in <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>. The evil it was written against has grown rather than diminished. 
<p>It has been carefully computed by those well able to form a correct opinion, that the total number of indoor poor in the Metropolitan Unions, amounts to, on an average given day, about <num value="27000">27,000</num>; on the <datestruct VALUE="1858-01-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct>, it was <num value="30098">30,098</num>: and this number, multiplied by <num value="3">3</num>, will give the total number of indoor poor in <num value="1">one</num> year, thus, <num value="27000">27,000</num> x <num value="3">3</num> = <num value="81000">81,000</num>. The total number of outdoor poor, on a given day, is about <num value="72000">72,000</num>; on the <datestruct VALUE="1858-01-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct>, it was <num value="73000">73,000</num>. This number, multiplied by <num value="3.50">3 1/2</num>, will give the total number of outdoor poor receiving relief in the course of a year, <num value="72000">72,000</num> x <num value="3.50">3 1/2</num> = <num value="252000">252,000</num>. Add to this the <num value="81000">81,000</num> indoor, and we have an annual aggregate of recipients of poor-law relief amounting to the enormous number of <num value="324000">324,000</num>. 
<p>The cost of this vast multitude amounts, on the average, to about <measure value="750000l." type=currency><num value="750000">750,000</num>l.</measure> annually. And, if the rates were equally spread over the real property of the metropolis, it would not be a very heavy burden to bear. The total property tax value of the metropolitan districts is nearly <measure value="14000000l." type=currency><num value="14000000">14,000,000</num>l.</measure> a year. If this enormous rental were equally burdened with the poor rate, it would amount to little more than <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure> in the pound per annum. But the grievance is, that it is <pb id="p.295" n="295"> not equally burdened. A few examples will prove the case better than a <num value="1000">thousand</num> arguments. A few facts will substantiate the injustice of the present distribution of the poor rate better than whole pages of declamation. 
<p>The parish of St. Nicholas, Deptford, paid in the year <datestruct value="1857"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct> (omitting fractions) <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> in the pound poor rate. St. Nicholas, Olave, in the City, paid <measure value="8s." type=currency><num value="8">8</num>s.</measure> in the pound. St. Ann, Blackfriars, paid <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>s.</measure> St. Mary Mounthaw, <measure value="5s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="5">5</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> Shadwell, <measure value="4s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="4">4</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> St. George's-in-the-East, <measure value="3s. 9d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="9">9</num>d.</measure>, Whitechapel, Bethnal Green, Shoreditch, Ratcliff, St. George's, Southwark, St. Saviour's, Bermondsey, Rotherhithe, Woolwich, Fulham, and some others, over <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> in the pound; while, on the other hand, the rich parishes of St. George's, Hanover-square, paid about <measure value="7d." type=currency><num value="7">7</num>d.</measure> in the pound; Paddington about <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> in the pound; St. James's, Westminster, about <measure value="10d." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>d.</measure> And it is worthy of remark, that the assessments are generally much higher in the poor parishes than in the wealthy ones. Many of the former are rated at the full value, while many of the latter do not exceed <num value="3">three</num>-fifths of the property tax valuation. This increases the disproportion very materially. 
<p>The following Table will show, at a glance, that the inequality of the poor rate is not confined to a few isolated parishes, districts, or unions in the metropolis, but that about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4">fourth</num> of the whole is grievously oppressed with pauperism; while another <num value="4">fourth</num> is almost entirely exempted from contributing towards the support of the poor. The remaining half, not included in the following Tables, will not be much affected by a general equalization of the rates over the <pb id="p.296" n="296"> whole metropolis, except so far that they will benefit by the general contentment among the poor which such an equalization would inevitably produce.

</TABLE>
 
<p>Here we have the reverse side of the picture. Poverty, squalor, wretchedness, destitution, starvation. Property of a less value than the <num value="4">four</num> rich unions paying <measure value="322000l." type=currency><num value="322000">322,000</num>l.</measure> a year poor rates, in lieu of <measure value="103000l." type=currency><num value="103000">103,000</num>l.</measure>, and supporting <num value="44539">44,539</num> poor in lieu of <num value="6435">6,435</num>. It will be seen that this is not the case of an isolated parish, or an exceptional union, but the case of <num value="12">twelve</num> unions, all in the same sad predicament; and to them might be added the equally distressed districts of Rotherhithe, St. Olave, Southwark, St. Luke, Old-street, Chelsea, and the East and West London Unions. Each and all of these are burdened with an overwhelming amount of pauperism, depreciating the property, and driving away every respectable inhabitant who can possibly reside elsewhere. The evil, then, is most extensive. It is <pb id="p.298" n="298"> daily and hourly increasing. The rich unions are gradually paying less, and the poor ones gradually increasing their expenditure in an equal ratio. The <num value="4">four</num> rich unions paid <measure value="107186l." type=currency><num value="107186">107,186</num>l.</measure> in <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>, or <measure value="3674l." type=currency><num value="3674">3,674</num>l.</measure> more than in <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>, while the <num value="12">twelve</num> poor unions paid <measure value="304048l." type=currency><num value="304048">304,048</num>l.</measure>, or <measure value="18541l." type=currency><num value="18541">18,541</num>l.</measure> less than in the succeeding year. And this is the inevitable tendency of the present operation of the law. The rich districts will gradually become richer, and the poor ones poorer. 
<p>No doubt a poor man prefers spontaneously to live in a poor locality. He does not like his poverty to be remarked by others; and he knows that it will not be remarked by those who are equally destitute with himself. It is evident to common sense that it contradicts the fitness of things for the nobleman and the beggar to jostle against each other day after day, and to live close to each other in the same town. It is the instinctive desire for a separation of classes which causes the large landowner of the West End to stipulate for the erection of good houses only on the property which he lets out to lease,--houses which the rich only are able to pay for, houses in which the poor cannot possibly hope to live. Hence in parishes like St. George's, Hanover-square, the poor, even if they wished it, are utterly unable to find houseroom. They may sweep the streets, may work as bricklayers, smiths, carpenters, painters, paviours, lamplighters, cabmen, butlers, footmen, cooks, housemaids, and so on in the aristocratic parishes of the West End, but it is impossible for them to live in houses of their own, or in the places where they work. There are no lodgings to be had suitable to their means, and so they go away to other <pb id="p.299" n="299"> neighbourhoods that are compelled to keep them when out of work, or prostrated by sickness, or by any other visitation of Divine Providence. The alteration of the Law of Settlement in <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, by which hired servants ceased to gain a settlement in the parishes where their employers lived, has been <num value="1">one</num> chief cause of the grievous inequality which has been pointed out. Before that law came into operation the parish of St. George, Hanover-square, paid <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> in the pound per annum, and other wealthy parishes in like proportion, but since it became the law of the land, the rates of the West End parishes, whose only poor are almost all livery servants -<num value="32">32</num> per cent. of the entire population of St. George, Hanover-square, being so employed--have gradually dwindled down to the present insignificant sum of sixpence or sevenpence in the pound per annum. Now, there is no intention of charging the influential inhabitants of the aristocratic parishes with the desire of wronging the poor by that enactment, but it is very certain that it has had that effect. While the servant is strong and healthy, his master in Belgravia has the benefit of his services; when he can no longer discharge his duties, he is turned adrift to seek relief in such parish as he may be able to obtain a lodging in. 
<p>But besides the alteration in the Law of Settlement above alluded to, great changes in the incidence of the poor rate have been caused by the various improvements that have been made from time to time in the Metropolis. The houses of the poorer classes have been pulled down for the widening of thoroughfares and the formation of new streets. The parish of St. Giles affords a remarkable instance of this. Large companies, <pb id="p.300" n="300"> too, by the purchase of such houses for the purpose of extending their business, have been instrumental in effecting such changes. <num value="1">One</num> of the most palpable instances of this is the contrast which exists between the poor rate paid by the St. Katharine and the London Docks. At the time that the St. Katharine Docks were formed, upwards of <num value="1000">one thousand</num> poor men's houses were pulled down, and their places occupied by the warehouses and quays of that powerful company. No provision was made for the ejected tenants of those houses who were driven at <num value="1">one</num> swoop from the parish where they were born, and where they were before chargeable, to the adjacent parishes of Whitechapel, Aldgate, St. George's-in-the-East, and Shadwell. 
<p>The pauperism of St. Katharine's became at once a vanishing quantity, while that of the neighbouring districts was simultaneously increased in an equal ratio. After <num value="5">five</num> years' residence the poor became irremovable, and the St. Katharine's Dock Company now pay about <measure value="700l." type=currency><num value="700">700</num>l.</measure> a year in poor rates, while the adjoining London Dock paid last year upwards of <measure value="19000l." type=currency><num value="19000">19,000</num>l.</measure> The <num value="2">two</num> companies employ the same class of labourers, their docks are close together, but the <num value="1">one</num> had the good fortune to occupy the whole of a parish, while the other only occupies portions of the <num value="4">four</num> parishes of St. George's East, Shadwell, Wapping, and Aldgate. But the question arises at once, is it fair that this enormous disproportion should exist between <num value="2">two</num> companies employing the same labourers, and being situate in such near proximity as these are? Is it fair that the <num value="1">one</num> should escape from contributing to the relief of the pauperism which their labour draws around them, and that the <pb id="p.301" n="301"> other should be compelled, not only to pay their own share, but the share of both? 
<p>The causes, then, of the inequality which at present notoriously exists in the incidence of the metropolitan poor rates, are these, <num value="1">1st</num>, The tendency which all men, more or less have, to consort with their equals in lifethat tendency which induces the man of wealth to live at the West End, and the poor man at the Eastthat tendency which has its material manifestation in the class of houses which are erected in those respective localities, and which tendency no legislation can remedy. <num value="2">2</num>ndly, The alteration of the Law of Settlement which deprived the servant living in the rich man's family of his claim upon the rich man's parish; and, <num value="3">3</num>rdly, The various improvements which have of late years destroyed many of the poor men's dwellings that were scattered here and there in the richer localities, and have driven them to take refuge in places already overcrowded with the poor, generating disease and misery and vice of the most fearful and alarming character. These are the chief causes of the evil whereof so many thousands of the ratepayers of the metropolis complain, and for which they ask, at the hands of an enlightened Legislature, a speedy and effectual remedy. 
<p>But it will be well to glance at the evils which result from this state of things. It is not the intention of the author of this pamphlet to lay much stress upon the deterioration of property in the overburdened parishes. The landlords and ratepayers, though they have valid reasons for complaint, are yet competent to defend their own interests, and make themselves heard through their representatives in Parliament. It may, however, be <pb id="p.302" n="302"> remarked, by the way, that almost all the inequality which has now grown to such an extravagant height has arisen within the last <num value="25">twenty-five</num> years; and that the present owners are suffering from a burden which, when the property was purchased, they had no right to anticipate. <num value="25">Twenty-five</num> years ago St. George's, Hanover-square, paid as high a rate as St. George'sin- the-East, but now it does not pay more than <num value="1">1</num>-<num value="8">8th</num> as much. It has dwindled down from <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> in the pound to <measure value="7d." type=currency><num value="7">7</num>d.</measure>, while St. George's-in-the-East has risen from <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> to nearly <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>s.</measure> in the pound. 
<p>The following statement will show the gradual increase of the burden in an Eastern parish, which is only a sample of the rest of its poor neighbours.

</TABLE>
 
<p>From the foregoing figures it will be seen that an enormous increase of pauperism has taken place during the last <num value="20">twenty</num> years. That the rates paid are nearly trebled, the number of persons relieved by the rates trebled, and the medical cases relieved more than <pb id="p.303" n="303"> quintupled. Indeed it is a startling fact that the meat given per week to the sick poor in <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct> was about <num value="6">6</num> or <num value="7">7</num> lb., and that it now amounts to <num value="300">300</num> lbs. per week. And this is the normal state of most of the poorer unions in the metropolis. Fulham, with its <measure value="138000l." type=currency><num value="138000">138,000</num>l.</measure> value, relieved more poor on the <datestruct VALUE="1858-01-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct>, than Paddington and St. George's, Hanover-square, with their <measure value="1600000l." type=currency><num value="1600000">1,600,000</num>l.</measure> of value. Meanwhile the wealthy parishes at the West End have been gradually diminishing their expenditure, or at all events not increasing it. In <datestruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></datestruct>, St. George's, Hanover-square, paid <measure value="21363l." type=currency><num value="21363">21,363</num>l.</measure>; in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, <measure value="14516l." type=currency><num value="14516">14,516</num>l.</measure>; in <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>, <measure value="21315l." type=currency><num value="21315">21,315</num>l.</measure>; and in <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>, about <measure value="23000l." type=currency><num value="23000">23,000</num>l.</measure> This statement shows the inevitable tendency of the present law, which is to make the rich parish richer, and the poor parish poorer. It tends to impoverish the ratepayers and to reduce the poor man to the very verge of starvation. It will be found on a careful calculation that the <num value="44539">44,539</num> paupers in the poorer unions above alluded to, are relieved at an expense of <measure value="322589l." type=currency><num value="322589">322,589</num>l.</measure> per annum, and that this gives about <num value="71">71</num>. <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure> per head, or <measure value="2s. 9d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="9">9</num>d.</measure> per week. Of course this sum includes every item of expense, relieving officers, medical officers, and all the charges incidental to the relief of the poor. Now, it must be very evident that the great body of the outdoor poor are the chief sufferers from the inadequacy of the relief afforded by such a sum as this. The indoor poor are all fed on the same dietary principles, or at all events there is not much variation in this respect in the different metropolitan unions; nor is it supposed that the salaries of union officials vary very much, though their duties are <num value="10">ten</num> times more arduous in some parishes than in others. The hardship <pb id="p.304" n="304"> then falls chiefly on the outdoor poor. They, in fact, as a general rule in the poorer parishes are <hi rend=italics>got rid of-</hi>
not <hi rend=italics>relieved</hi>, for it would be a mockery to call it reliefat the expense of a shilling and a loaf per week. 
<p>Now what is done in the richer unions, in Paddington and St. George's, Hanover Square? The poor-rates in <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct> amounted in the former of these parishes to about <measure value="13000l." type=currency><num value="13000">13,000</num>l.</measure>, and in the latter to about <measure value="23000l." type=currency><num value="23000">23,000</num>l.</measure> The total amount of their poor on the <datestruct VALUE="1858-01-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct>, was <num value="2343">2,343</num>. Now this gives an average of <measure value="15l." type=currency><num value="15">15</num>l.</measure> <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">7</num>s.</measure> expended on each poor person relieved, against <num value="71">71</num>. <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure>; or nearly <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>s.</measure> per week, instead of <measure value="2s. 9d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="9">9</num>d.</measure> Every reflecting person will ask whether this is fair to the poor man. Is he, because he belongs to the City Union, to receive out-door relief to the amount of <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure> and a loaf per week, with a new suit of clothes at Christmas; or, because he belongs to Paddington, to be amply supported in his distress; and is he, on the other hand, because he belongs to St. George'sin- the-East or Bethnal Green, to be reduced to starvation? The law ought to be equal for all. But it is not equal, nor will it ever be equal till the whole of the Metropolitan area is subjected to an equalized rate, on a fair and just basis of assessment. 
<p>But some may say that the condition of the poor in London is after all not so very bad, that we do not hear of any outbreaks of starving people, or any resistance to the laws as at present administered. Those who have a stake in the welfare of this great city ought not to be left in ignorance of the fact that almost every winter some of the bakers' shops are stripped of their contents by the starving multitudes, <pb id="p.305" n="305"> assisted, of course, by persons of bad character who make the prevailing distress the excuse for robbery. Instances of this have occurred within the last <num value="2">two</num> months, and large bodies of the unemployed have been marching about terrifying the timid, and creating feelings of alarm even among the boldest. Perhaps it may be objected, that these men were not in distress, but have only made distress an excuse for their lawlessness. This is not the case, for such exhibitions are never seen except in seasons of distress. It is a remarkable fact, for which the writer appeals to personal experience, that when work is scarce, or unattainable, there will be upwards of <num value="100">one hundred</num> applications for assistance, in <num value="1">one</num> day at the church vestry, after week-day service, and this will continue as long as the distress continues; but as soon as employment is obtainable, the applications drop off from <num value="100">one hundred</num> to less than <num value="10">ten</num> in the course of a single week. This is a strong proof that the London poor are not mendicants from choice, that they only apply for assistance when they stand absolutely in need of it. And doubtless there are many whom even the pressure of the most urgent distress will not drive from their seclusion to seek the aid of the charitable, much less of the relieving officer. During the last winter the writer relieved on the same day the daughter of a rector, and grand-daughter of an Irish bishop, and <num value="1">one</num> who had been the chief constable in <num value="1">one</num> of the largest parishes in London. Nor are such cases as uncommon as many would suppose. What would the weekly shilling and the weekly loaf do for such as these! These are the people, and such as these that are ranged under the head of <QUOTE>deaths <pb id="p.306" n="306"> by privation,</QUOTE> which forms so fearful an item in the Registrar-General's periodical report. 
<p>Let the rich men of London read the following extract from that report, and ponder well upon it while they enjoy the temporal blessings which God has given them with no unsparing hand:--

<p>These <num value="4">four</num> classes of deaths are all more or less the result of inadequate food; the <num value="1">first</num> absolutely so; and the <num value="2">second</num> generally arises from the nursing mother not obtaining such nourishment as is necessary for her at such a time. And it will be observed that as the poor rates have diminished in the richer, and increased in the poorer parishes of the metropolis, so these deaths have increased in an equal ratio. In the short space of <num value="10">ten</num> years they have nearly doubled: they have risen from <num value="222">222</num> in <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct>, to <num value="416">416</num> in <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>. <num value="3292">Three thousand two hundred and ninety-two</num> victims of want in <num value="10">ten</num> years! 
<p>Some people say that if the rates be equalized over London extravagance will be the result. But what extravagance can possibly be so extravagant as the extravagance of human life which the present state of things encourages and keeps up! What moneyextrava- gance is worthy to be compared with that which the telltale record of the Registrar-General here discloses to our view! <pb id="p.307" n="307"> 
<p>It can be neither politic nor economical to permit the wanton waste both of property and of human life which the present operation of the poor-law undoubtedly causes in the metropolis. It is not politic, because the large amounts of relief given in the rich parishes of the City and West End, tend only to increase idleness and sloth; to make the poor depend more upon parochial assistance than upon their own exertions: and at the same time the miserable pittance doled out to the suffering poor of the destitute parishes only tends to make them discontented and even dangerous; leading sometimes to suicide and despair, and at other times to the commission of wilful and deliberate crime. 
<p>The suicides by hanging in London in <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>, were <num value="106">106</num>; by poison, <num value="107">107</num>; by drowning, <num value="371">371</num>: making a total of <num value="584">584</num>. There can be no moral doubt whatever that if the circumstances of each were known, destitution would prove to be the cause of a very large percentage of these deaths. 
<p>The cases of privation which occurred in the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="6">six</num> weeks of the present year (<datestruct value="1858"><year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct>), were all without exception in poor and oppressively rated parishes, in Shadwell, in Chelsea, in St. Margaret's, Westminster, in Bethnal Green, in Poplar and in Lambeth; every <num value="1">one</num> of which complains of the unfair distribution of the poor rate in the metropolis. The clergy of Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Chelsea, Poplar and Lambeth have petitioned for an alteration in the present law; and have they not a cause? shall they suffer their poor to be starved to death and raise no cry in their behalf? <pb id="p.308" n="308"> 
<p>They are of opinion that private charity will never be able to supply an adequate cure for the disease. It has done much, and doubtless without its aid the number of persons perishing annually from destitution would have been much greater than they are at present. But all the charity of all the societies established in London for the relief of the distressed, will be found to amount to less than a farthing in the pound on the property tax value of the metropolis. There are <num value="2">two</num> societies which take the lead in ministering to the urgent wants of the necessitous in the winter season, these are the Metropolitan District Visiting and Relief Association, whose offices are in St. Martin's-place, Trafalgar-square, and the Philanthropic Society. Now the total income of both these societies does not amount to more than <measure value="5000l." type=currency><num value="5000">5,000</num>l.</measure> per annum. The income of the former is a little over <measure value="3000l." type=currency><num value="3000">3,000</num>l.</measure> a year, and of the latter somewhat more than <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> These sums are very judiciously expended, and have saved many valuable lives every year; but what are they when compared with the expenditure of the poor rates, which amounts to <measure value="800000l." type=currency><num value="800000">800,000</num>l.</measure> per annum? 
<p>It is calculated that <measure value="1d." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>d.</measure> in the pound on the whole value of the metropolis would give <measure value="50000l." type=currency><num value="50000">50,000</num>l.</measure>, or <num value="10">ten</num> times the amount of the sum expended by both the associations alluded to. And is it likely that the benevolent donations of the rich will ever reach a sum like this? If private charity then be utterly inadequate to meet the difficulty, no other plan remains but an equal rate over the whole of the Metropolitan Districts. 
<p>Notwithstanding the multitudes of returns made to <pb id="p.309" n="309"> parliament in the statistics of poor-law relief, there is yet a considerable amount of difficulty in ascertaining the exact sums spent for the relief of the poor. And this difficulty is very much increased by the want of explicit information from the lightly rated parishes. They usually return the police and county rate with the poor rate, and then say that the inequality is not so great as it really is. Now police and county rates do not vary much, and the former would probably be higher in the West than in the East, because of the greater amount of property to be protected; they therefore ought to be discarded from the computation altogether as having nothing whatever to do with the relief and maintenance of the poor. But St. George's, Hanover-square, includes poor, police, county, baths and washhouses, and burial board, in <num value="1">one</num> item, amounting, in the aggregate, to <measure value="1s. 10d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="10">10</num>d.</measure> in the pound. Probably the poor relief is not more than <measure value="7d." type=currency><num value="7">7</num>d.</measure> or <measure value="8d." type=currency><num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> For the police cost <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> in the pound, and the county rate <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>d.</measure>, so that there is only <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure> left for baths, washhouses, burial board, and poor. Again, the return from Paddington includes the same items under <num value="1">one</num> head, and the amount is only <measure value="1s. 1d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="1">1</num>d.</measure> Now it would not only be much fairer, but much more in accordance with the form of the required return, that the items should be stated separately, as in Shoreditch, where it stands thus,--county rate, <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>d.</measure>; police rate, <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>; poor rate, <measure value="3s. 10d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="10">10</num>d.</measure>; baths and washhouses, <hi rend=italics>nil.</hi> Or in St. George'sin-the-East, where the items are,--county rate, <measure value="3d." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>d.</measure>; police rate, <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>; poor rate, <measure value="3s. 9d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="9">9</num>d.</measure> 
<p>The difficulty of ascertaining the exact amount of inequality was fully admitted by the assistant secretary <pb id="p.310" n="310"> to the Poor Law Board, Mr. Lumley, in the able paper read by him before the Statistical Society, on the <datestruct VALUE="0-04-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct> last, which paper it may be well to offer a few remarks upon in this place. Mr. Lumley, as the groundwork of his observations, divides the whole of the metropolitan unions into <num value="5">five</num> districts, the Western, Central, Eastern, Surrey, and the Kentish. After giving the comparative amounts raised in each of these districts in <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, and showing that the rate per pound then varied very little indeed, the Western being <measure value="2s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure>, the Central, <measure value="2s. 9d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="9">9</num>d.</measure>, the Eastern, <measure value="2s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure>, the Surrey, <measure value="2s. 9d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="9">9</num>d.</measure>, and the Kentish portion, <measure value="3s. 5d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="5">5</num>d.</measure>, he went on to show that a great alteration had taken place of late years, the return for <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct> making the Western only <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure>, the Central about <measure value="1s. 3d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="3">3</num>d.</measure>, the Surrey and Kentish about <measure value="1s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>, while the Eastern district had risen to <measure value="2s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure>, proving that in the last half century the separation of the richer from the poorer classes has mainly taken place. 
<p>Perhaps some persons may be inclined to say that the difference between the western portion and the eastern is not so very great, only <measure value="1s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> in the pound, it is hardly worth the outcry that is made on the subject; the inequality is not so extensive after all. But if the subject is examined a little more carefully, it will be seen that Mr. Lumley's statements are no criteria whatever as to the inequalities of the existing rates. In every <num value="1">one</num> of the districts averaged by Mr. Lumley there are poor parishes thrown in with rich ones, and the small rates of some make amends in the average for the large rates of others. For example, the Western average is <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure> in the pound, but Fulham, which is a <pb id="p.311" n="311"> component part of the average, paid last year <measure value="3s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> against Paddington's <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>d.</measure>; Chelsea paid <measure value="2s. 5d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="5">5</num>d.</measure> against St. George's <measure value="7d." type=currency><num value="7">7</num>d.</measure> It is true that the average may be <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure>, but does Fulham only pay <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure>? does Chelsea, does Hammersmith? The central portion again was shown to average <measure value="1s. 3d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="3">3</num>d.</measure> How is this average made up? Of such glaring facts as this: St. Christopher-le-Stock, rated at <measure value="9000l." type=currency><num value="9000">9,000</num>l.</measure> a year, paying <measure value="2l." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>l.</measure> for the next <num value="6">six</num> months, and St. Mary Mounthaw, rated at <measure value="900l." type=currency><num value="900">900</num>l.</measure>, paying over <measure value="600l." type=currency><num value="600">600</num>l.</measure> for the same period. The <num value="1">one</num> a sum too small to calculate, the other <measure value="13s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="13">13</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> in the pound for the <num value="6">six</num> months. The average therefore is an utter fallacy, as far as the inequality of the parochial poor rates are concerned. Mr. Lumley admitted, and it was a great admission to make, that an union rate might be very well applied to the whole of the <num value="98">ninety-eight</num> City parishes. And if so, why not to the whole metropolis? Again, with regard to the Kentish district the same observation is applicable. The average is about <measure value="1s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> But the utmost disparity exists in the component elements of that average. It will be enough to say that Kidbrook pays only <measure value="0.50d." type=currency><num value="0.50">1/2</num>d.</measure> in the pound per annum, and St. Nicholas, Deptford, over <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>s.</measure> And in the Surrey division, inequalities of the same kind, though perhaps not so glaring, undoubtedly exist. The average is about <measure value="1s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> But St. George, Southwark, paid <measure value="3s. 1d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="1">1</num>d.</measure>, Rotherhithe, <measure value="3s. 2d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="2">2</num>d.</measure>, Bermondsey, <measure value="3s. 2d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="2">2</num>d.</measure>, St. Saviour's and Christ Church about <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure>, while Putney, Battersea, Clapham, and Streatham paid comparatively little in the shape of poor rates. And in the Eastern district also, the average of which was shown to be <measure value="2s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure>, the same remarks may be made. Shoreditch, paying <pb id="p.312" n="312"> <measure value="3s. 10d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="10">10</num>d.</measure>, and St. George's-in-the-East, <measure value="3s. 9d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="9">9</num>d.</measure>, are placed by the side of St. Katharine, where the poor rates are merely nominal. It is no consolation whatever to the struggling ratepayers to assure them that the <hi rend=italics>average</hi> is but light, when they pay not according to the average, but according to the arbitrary demands made for the starving poor, dwelling in the limited area of their own parish. <num value="2">2</num> + <num value="10">10</num> would give an average of <num value="6">6</num>, but that average does not destroy the original inequality between <num value="2">2</num> and <num value="10">10</num>. It still remains <num value="5">5</num> to <num value="1">1</num>. Though Mr. Lumley admits that an equal rate would be a blessing to the City, and that the Eastern district pays <num value="2">2</num> <num value="1">1</num>/<num value="3">3</num> times as much for the poor as the Western, and that this disparity is on the increase, Shoreditch having increased its expenditure for the poor, <measure value="10418l." type=currency><num value="10418">10,418</num>l.</measure> in the last year, and St. George's-in-the-East, <measure value="9508l." type=currency><num value="9508">9,508</num>l.</measure> during the same period, yet he refuses to decide for or against the proposal which has been made to equalize the rates over the whole area. He states that this has been done in Oxford, Liverpool, Bristol, Exeter, and other places, and therefore there is his official authority for the fact that the measure which this pamphlet is intended to support, involves no novelty, but is recommended for adoption, not only by the sympathies of the humane, but by the practical deductions of the experienced. 
<p>The increase of the poor rate in the distressed Eastern districts during the last <num value="5">five</num> years has been enormous, and is still going on. The <num value="6">six</num> unions of Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, St. George's-in-the-East, Shoreditch, Stepney, and Poplar, though their annual value is under a million and a half, have increased <pb id="p.313" n="313"> <measure value="90000l." type=currency><num value="90000">90,000</num>l.</measure> per annum in the last <num value="5">five</num> years, <hi rend=italics>i. e.</hi> from <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>. It would startle any of the respectable ratepayers of the richer parishes to be informed of the number of summonses that are issued every quarter for the rates: they amount to upwards of <num value="4000">4,000</num> in the parish of George's-in-the-East alone. And, of course, many of the poor persons summonsed are unable to pay.

<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>For some time past<NOTE>Quoted from <title>The Times</title>.</NOTE> monthly returns of the number of persons in receipt of relief in England and Wales have shown a decrease in comparison with the corresponding months of the previous year, but at length in December the scale has been turned, and whereas at the close of <datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct> the number was <num value="827461">827,461</num>, it was <num value="835129">835,129</num> at the close of <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, an increase of <num value="7668">7,668</num>, not far from <num value="1">1</num> per cent. This increase is chiefly due to the midland counties and the metropolis, Wales and the eastern counties adding in a less degree to it; but the manufacturing districts in the north continued to show a considerable decrease in the number of paupers relieved. Thus far as to the comparison between <datestruct VALUE="1859-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>, and <datestruct VALUE="1860-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>; but another comparison may be made-namely, between the beginning and the end of December last, to show to what extent the poor law had then met the distress caused by the severe weather which set in in the middle of that month. Now, these returns show that <pb id="p.314" n="314"> the numbers relieved at the end of the <num value="1">first</num> week of last December were <num value="807187">807,187</num>, and at the end of the <num value="4">fourth</num> week <num value="835129">835,129</num>, an increase of only <num value="27942">27,942</num>, or <num value="3">3</num>.<num value="46">46</num> per cent. In fact, the increase of relief in that extraordinary weather was not so very much more than always takes place in December. In <datestruct VALUE="1858-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct>, the numbers relieved at the end of the <num value="4">fourth</num> week were <num value="13146">13,146</num> more than at end of the <num value="1">first</num> week; in <datestruct VALUE="1859-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>, <num value="22051">22,051</num> more; in <datestruct VALUE="1860-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, <num value="27942">27,942</num> more. Taking all England, fewer persons by <num value="23533">23,533</num> were receiving relief at the end of <datestruct VALUE="1860-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, than at the end of <datestruct VALUE="1858-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct>, and fewer in every week of the month; and fewer persons received outdoor relief in every week of <datestruct VALUE="1860-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, than in the corresponding week of <datestruct VALUE="1859-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>. In the metropolis, where the cry of distress seemed so great, <num value="95237">95,237</num> persons were in the receipt of relief at the close of the <num value="4">fourth</num> week of <datestruct VALUE="1860-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, <num value="91665">91,665</num> at the corresponding period of <datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>, an increase of <num value="3572">3,572</num>; but in every week of <datestruct VALUE="1860-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, the numbers relieved were fewer than in <datestruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct>; and the number relieved at the end of the <num value="4">fourth</num> week of last December was only <num value="3920">3,920</num> more than at the end of the <num value="1">first</num> week, when the cold weather had not begun. 
<p>At the end of the <num value="4">fourth</num> week in December, though the cold had already become so severe, the number of persons receiving relief (<num value="835129">835,129</num>) was not at all extraordinary for the time of year; but the continuance of the inclement weather then began to tell, and at the end of the <num value="3">third</num> week in January the number had risen to <num value="948379">948,379</num>, more than <num value="14">14</num> per cent. above the <pb id="p.315" n="315"> corresponding period of <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, and even at the end of the month, with changed weather, it was still <num value="10">10</num> per cent. above the previous year. But we find that the highest numbers here reported as relieved only show an increase, for all England and Wales, of <num value="118382">118,382</num> above the numbers in <datestruct VALUE="1860-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, which was a month of mild weather. The distribution of this increase is not less remarkable. In the metropolis it was no less than <num value="42">42</num> per cent. above the previous year, the numbers relieved were more by <num value="38851">38,851</num>, and the large demands upon private charity seem to prove that this did not meet the necessities of the case; but in the country the increase was not to be compared with this. In the South-Western district it was not <num value="2">2</num> per cent. That district has at all times a greater proportion of its population pauperized, and there may be a smaller body for sudden pressure to affect. The difference, again, in the way in which the additional relief was dealt out in different districts is remarkable. In London it was nearly all outdoor relief; at the end of the <num value="3">third</num> week of December the indoor poor were <num value="28740">28,740</num>, and a month later they were only <num value="29959">29,959</num>, though above <num value="37000">37,000</num> persons more were then receiving relief. On the other hand, in the eastern counties, with not near half that additional number of persons receiving relief at the end of the <num value="3">third</num> week in January, the increase of indoor poor was more than double what it was in the metropolis.</QUOTE>
 <pb id="p.316" n="316"> 
<p>Now comes a diary of the charitable work at some of the London police-courts, extracted from the newspapers. It shows how the applications for relief, and the funds for relieving, ceased with the approach of fine weather. 
<p>To what extent the knowledge that no more money was to be given away acted upon the different crowds who flocked round the magistrates, will always, perhaps, remain a mystery. <num value="1">One</num> thing may, however, be safely assumed: the degrading public exhibition of so much mixed poverty and imposition, and the knowledge that they had only to ask to have, must have had a very demoralizing effect upon the poor.

The want of employment, and the unusual severity of the weather, combined with the dearness of fuel and the high price of provisions, have caused an enormous amount of distress in the densely populated district assigned to the court. Mr. Selfe said he was compelled to limit his assistance to those whose honesty and good character were verified by the clergy of the district, and he could only relieve the most deserving of those. A poor shipwrecked sailor boy, thinly clad, and very ill, was presented to the magistrate in the most deplorable condition. He was half starved, and in danger of perishing. Mr. Selfe directed Howland, <num value="83">83</num> H, an officer of the <pb id="p.317" n="317"> court, to provide the boy with food, a suit of warm clothing, and pay his railway fare to Newport, in Wales, where his friends are residing. 
<p><hi rend=italics><datestruct VALUE="0-01-1"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=1>1st</day></datestruct></hi>, <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.-A poor woman named Sarah Smith, dwelling in Poplar, came before Mr. Yardley, and stated that, owing to the inclemency of the weather, and to her husband being out of employ, she was in great distress, and upon applying to <num value="1">one</num> of the relieving officers of the Poplar Union, he refused to relieve her and her family. 
<p>Mr. Yardley: Upon what grounds did he refuse? 
<p>Applicant: He said there were too many of us. 
<p>Mr. Yardley: How many children have you? 
<p>Applicant: <num value="7">Seven</num>, sir. The eldest is <num value="15">fifteen</num> years, and the youngest <num value="11">eleven</num> months old. 
<p>Mr. Yardley could hardly believe that any relieving officer would assign as a reason for refusing relief the number of a family. It was a most unlikely story, indeed. If the relieving officer had given as a reason for not relieving a man and his family that they were <num value="9">nine</num> in number, he was a most inconsistent and unreasonable person. It was the <num value="1">first</num> time he had ever heard of relief being denied to a man and woman in distress because they had a large family. That was an additional reason, in addition to the ordinary ones, for administering relief. He would write a letter to Mr. Jeffreys, the principal relieving officer of the Poplar Union, calling attention to the case, and he was quite sure if the family were deserving, and the parents were persons of good repute, that they would be promptly and effectually relieved. 
<p>Mr. Yardley said he wished it to be distinctly <pb id="p.318" n="318"> understood that it was no part of his duty to relieve the poor of the district, or to perform the functions of a relieving officer. The poor-box fund was applied to peculiar cases of destitution and distress in the court, to cases of a peculiar nature springing out of the investigations in the court. He could not attempt to relieve the destitution in the district, which he had no doubt was very great. 
<p>Mr. Selfe has opened about <num value="3000">3,000</num> letters of recommendation, and afforded temporary relief to about <num value="600">600</num> persons in the course of the last <num value="5">five</num> weeks. Yesterday numerous destitute widows and others came to the court with recommendatory certificates, certifying their poverty and good character, and were informed it was useless for them to wait, and that they had better apply on Thursday next, when Mr. Selfe will preside. 
<p><hi rend=italics><datestruct VALUE="0-01-4"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=4>4th</day></datestruct></hi>, <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.-Mr. Selfe said he could only return thanks through the medium of the public journals for the liberal donations forwarded to him on behalf of the poor. He quite agreed with the observations of his learned colleague, Mr. Yardley, that it was only a subsidiary portion of the duty of the magistrate in the police-courts to relieve cases of distress, and that they were not relieving officers; but the system had grown with the police-courts, and had been productive of incalculable good. He also agreed with his colleague that the administration of the poor-box fund ought not to be allowed to interfere with the ordinary business of the court. It was true, as was observed by his colleague, that there was not a proper organization, and no relieving officers appointed to inquire into cases of distress presented in that court; but they did their <pb id="p.319" n="319"> best; and every <num value="1">one</num> who had watched the administration of relief must be aware that very little imposition was practised. Everything possible was done to guard against imposition. If the magistrates erred at all, it was on the side of over-caution. He had turned away more urgent cases of distress than he had relieved, or than it was possible to inquire into. The relief at police courts was administered, and the money disposed of, without <num value="1">one</num> farthing of expense. There were no treasurers, secretaries, collectors, inquiring officers, or rent of offices to pay. The principal contributions forwarded to the poor-boxes of the police-courts were subscribed by the nobility and gentry of the West End, a few of the influential Livery companies of the City of London, and some of the large firms both in the City and West End. 
<p><hi rend=italics><datestruct VALUE="0-01-12"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=12>12th</day></datestruct></hi>, <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.-A great number of unemployed coalwhippers, dock labourers, lumpers, hammermen, and others, have been loitering about the court for the last <num value="2">two</num> days, in expectation of obtaining some relief from the poor fund. They were all evidently in a state of great distress, and many stalwart men, anxious to obtain a living by honest industry, were suffering from cold and hunger, and very thinly clad. On Thursday evening Mr. Yardley directed Mr. Livingston, the chief usher, to relieve <num value="20">twenty</num> poor fellows with <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> each. After the business of the court had terminated yesterday evening, Mr. Yardley directed Mr. Livingston to distribute <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>l.</measure> in small sums among poor men in want of employment who were assembled in the waiting-room and the avenues of the court. After the magistrate left the bench, the chief usher presented <pb id="p.320" n="320"> <num value="150">150</num> of the poor men with <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> each, and a few with <measure value="1s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> each, until the <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>l.</measure> was expended. 
<p><hi rend=italics><datestruct VALUE="0-01-14"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=14>14th</day></datestruct></hi>, <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.-On Saturday, soon after the night charges were disposed of at the Thames Police-court, a great number of unemployed coal-whippers, dock labourers, lumpers, and others, began to assemble in the street opposite the court, in hopes of obtaining some relief from the poor-box fund. At <num value="4">four</num> o'clock the applicants for relief had increased to <num value="700">700</num>, and the gates of the station-house yard were thrown open, and ample room found for the poor fellows there. Mr. Yardley, the presiding magistrate, believing the numbers would not exceed <num value="600">600</num>, directed Mr. Livingston, the chief usher, to obtain <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">50</num>l.</measure> worth of silver, and distribute the same among the crowd at his discretion. Every person among them was in a state of great distress and in want of food. A majority of them were married, with wives and children at home actually starving. Of course, with such a number assembled to crave a little assistance, inquiries were out of the question; but, in addition to the chief usher, there were other astute officers in attendance, who could tell, at a glance, whether the person soliciting aid was what he represented himself to be, and the only questions put were the following:-- What are you? Are you married or single? How many children? And to some who were well known those questions were avoided. The number of destitute labourers increased every minute, and when the <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">50</num>l.</measure> of silver was exhausted, there were at least <num value="500">500</num> more clamouring for a bit of bread in the station-house yard. The chief usher took hasty counsel with his brother officers, and finding it impossible to send any of the <pb id="p.321" n="321"> destitute creatures away empty-handed, procured an additional <measure value="30l." type=currency><num value="30">30</num>l.</measure> worth of silver, and distributed that also to the best of his judgment.

The total number relieved was exactly <num value="1500">1,500</num>, including <num value="50">50</num> women, and at least <num value="1000">1,000</num> of them were Irishmen, who always suffer naturally by the suspension of business in the docks, on the wharves, and on the river, and whose precarious earnings at all times are very small, though engaged in the most laborious and roughest work of the port of London. It was intended to confine the relief to unemployed labourers only, Mr. Selfe having relieved about <num value="800">800</num> destitute women in the course of the last <num value="3">three</num> weeks; but <num value="50">fifty</num> half-starved seamstresses got into the station-yard behind the men, and it was impossible to send them away without a shilling or a sixpence. It is believed that on Saturday there were <num value="26000">26,000</num> labourers out of employ in the district of this court. 
<p><hi rend=italics>January</hi> <num value="16">16th</num>, <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.-Yesterday the applicants for relief from the poor-box were again very numerous, and Mr. Yardley, on hearing that a vast number of unemployed labourers were assembled in front of the court, gave instructions to Mr. Livingston, the chief usher, to obtain <measure value="80l." type=currency><num value="80">80</num>l.</measure> worth of silver, and distribute it among them to the best of his judgment. A few words of inquiry only were addressed to each individual, but imposition was almost impossible.

There were upwards of <num value="100">100</num> poor women craving relief in attendance, and they were <pb id="p.322" n="322"> directed to attend with letters of recommendation from persons known to the magistrate, and their cases would be seen to. 
<p><hi rend=italics>January</hi> <num value="17">17th</num>, <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.-The magistrates of this court have each adopted a different system of administering relief to the unemployed and destitute population of the district. Mr. Selfe commenced by relieving poor women whose poverty and misery were verified by the clergy of all sects in the district, and others of repute known to him, and in this way gave temporary relief to about <num value="700">700</num> women, principally widows, and a few men. Mr. Yardley commenced by relieving a few unemployed labourers on Thursday evening last, and their numbers increased daily until Tuesday, when <num value="1100">1,100</num> out of <num value="1500">1,500</num> assembled were assisted; about <num value="300">300</num> with <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure> each, <num value="100">100</num> with <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> each, and another <num value="100">100</num> with <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>s.</measure> or <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> each. It was announced on Tuesday that women only would be relieved on the following day, and that letters of verification from the clergy or from ladies and gentlemen known to the magistrates only, would be attended to. At noon, a vast assemblage of poor women thinly clad, many suffering from cold and hunger, assembled in the street. They continued to increase until they amounted to at last <num value="2000">2,000</num>, and as they completely blocked up Arbour-street East, directions were given to admit them into the station-house yard, the great gates of which were thrown open for that purpose. About <num value="1000">1,000</num> letters were handed to Mr. Selfe in the course of the day by the half-famished creatures. A selection was absolutely necessary, and the letters from tradesmen and landlords not known to the magistrate, and not a few of whom were suspected <pb id="p.323" n="323"> of recommending applicants for the purpose of obtaining payments of debts and arrears of rent, were thrown aside. Soon after <num value="4">four</num> o'clock not fewer than <num value="3000">3,000</num> women and about <num value="200">200</num> men had assembled. 
<p><hi rend=italics><datestruct VALUE="0-01-18"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=18>18th</day></datestruct></hi>, <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.-Mr. Selfe said the conduct of the police and the officers of the court, during a very trying period, was beyond all praise, and he was much indebted to Mr. Griffin and Mr. Hayes for their attention, and the excellent manner in which they had carried out a most difficult duty. He asked how many there were assembled in the street now? 
<p>Mr. Griffin: Upwards of <num value="2000">2,000</num> men and women. 
<p>Mr. Selfe: I am sorry there are so many. I do not intend to relieve the men to-night. I cannot do it, but as many as possible will be provided by Mr. Livingston with a loaf of bread. 
<p>Soon afterwards all the females, about <num value="1100">1,100</num> in number, were admitted into the yard, and, under the direction of the police, found an entry into the court in batches of <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> at a time. The letters and recommendations of great numbers were from persons of whom the magistrate knew nothing. Others were satisfactory, and in the course of the evening <num value="300">300</num> women were relieved at a cost of <measure value="45l." type=currency><num value="45">45</num>l.</measure>, in sums of from <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure> to <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">7</num>s.</measure> each. <num value="340">340</num> bread tickets were given away, <num value="1">one</num> woman was relieved with <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>l.</measure> was given to a Protestant minister for the relief of destitute persons belonging to his flock, and <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>l.</measure> to a Roman Catholic priest for a similar purpose. The men, principally Irish labourers, and without employ, waited in the street opposite to the court until nearly <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock, and finding there was nothing for them except the <pb id="p.324" n="324"> bread tickets, which only a small portion of them obtained, they departed sorrowfully enough. 
<p><hi rend=italics><datestruct VALUE="0-01-19"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=19>19th</day></datestruct></hi>, <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.-The assemblage this day of destitute people seeking relief from the poor-box fund was greater than ever, and among them were several cases of appalling distress. Creed and country were not considered in the distribution of relief. The representatives of the High Church, Low Church, and Broad Church were on the bench at <num value="1">one</num> time, soliciting aid for the humble members of their flocks who were in want. At <num value="3">three</num> o'clock upwards of <num value="4000">4,000</num> men and women were assembled, and a large force of police of the K division were in attendance, under the direction of Mr. Howie, superintendent, and Inspectors Griffin and Hayes, of the K division. The greatest eagerness was manifested by the people, many of whom had been waiting several hours to obtain relief; and if it had not been for the great care, forbearance, and firmness of the police, numerous accidents, if not loss of life, would have occurred. The rush occasionally was tremendous. About <num value="200">200</num> at a time were admitted into the yard between the station-house and the court, and, under well-managed regulations, were admitted into the court <num value="30">thirty</num> and <num value="40">forty</num> at a time. Mr. Selfe personally inquired into and ordered relief to those who produced the printed forms filled up. <num value="9">Nine</num>-tenths of them were poor women, the rest were coal-whippers and labourers, recommended by that well-known philanthropist, Mr. Gowland. 
<p><hi rend=italics><datestruct VALUE="0-01-22"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=22>22nd</day></datestruct></hi>, <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.--Notwithstanding the favourable change of the weather, and the partial resumption of business on the river and in the docks, great numbers <pb id="p.325" n="325"> of poor and hungry persons besieged the Thames Police-court in hopes of obtaining relief. 
<p>Mr. Yardley said the cases he wished to relieve were those of poor men who had been thrown out of employment by the stoppage of business on the river and in the docks. He was in hopes the whole of them would have been employed with this favourable change in the weather, but it was not so, and the magistrates were overwhelmed with applications, and with letters containing money. It was impossible to go on day after day relieving, or attempting to relieve, unemployed workmen and labourers from all quarters, who flocked to the court. Relief had been given to many thousands last week, and there must now be some limit to it. 
<p>Mr. Selfe was engaged in a private room for several hours in making inquiries, and relieving persons who presented the printed forms issued by the court, properly filled up by trustworthy and honourable persons who had been supplied with them by the magistrate. Mr. Selfe attaches great value to this system of giving relief, as preventing the possibility of imposition, for he not only makes every person responsible for the accuracy of the statements made in those papers, but he inquires of each person calling upon him with them whether they are fit objects of relief or not. He relieved <num value="150">150</num> deserving persons of both sexes yesterday in sums varying from <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> to <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">7</num>s.</measure> each. 
<p><hi rend=italics><datestruct VALUE="0-01-23"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=23>23rd</day></datestruct></hi>, <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.-In the afternoon Mr. Livingston, the chief usher, relieved <num value="500">500</num> unemployed docklabourers, coalwhippers, and workmen, by order of Mr. Yardley. Some received <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>s.</measure>, others <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>, and the remainder <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> each. In all <measure value="75l." type=currency><num value="75">75</num>l.</measure> worth of silver was <pb id="p.326" n="326"> distributed. There were at least <num value="400">400</num> hungry and destitute men turned away empty-handed. 
<p><hi rend=italics><datestruct VALUE="0-01-25"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=25>25th</day></datestruct></hi>, <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.-There was an immense gathering of poor and destitute persons in the vicinity of this court yesterday, to solicit relief from the poor-box, and incessant applications were made in the course of the day by clergymen of various creeds, deputations from relief committees, and others, for assistance. Mr. Selfe shortly investigated their various claims, and awarded upwards of <measure value="400l." type=currency><num value="400">400</num>l.</measure> among those who waited upon him. Mr. Selfe relieved about <num value="500">500</num> persons with sums varying from <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> to <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>s.</measure> The average was about <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure> each applicant. The forms revealed an appalling amount of distress in every conceivable shape, and many of them contained such entries as their family starving, not an atom of furniture, children huddled together on the floor or on straw, and other similar details. Mr. Selfe more than once remarked that many of the cases ought to be visited and relieved by parochial officers, and effectually dealt with by them, as they were beyond the range of the temporary relief that could be afforded by a police-court poor-box. The magistrate, whose patience, perseverance, and humanity, during a very trying season, has been above all praise, did not terminate his useful and humane labours until midnight, when he retired in a most exhausted state. 
<p><hi rend=italics><datestruct VALUE="0-01-26"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=26>26th</day></datestruct></hi>, <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.-A considerable number of poor individuals collected in front of the court, in expectation of obtaining some relief from the poor-box fund, but they were of a very different class to those who have hitherto sought for and obtained assistance. There were few coal-whippers and labourers among them, and <pb id="p.327" n="327"> it was reported to Mr. Selfe that the various dock companies were now employing a great many hands, and that the Victoria Dock Company, at Plaistow, sent <QUOTE>over the border</QUOTE> to Middlesex for <num value="500">500</num> labourers yesterday. The large engineering firms and proprietors of chemical works in Ratcliff, Limehouse, Stepney, and Poplar, are about to resume their operations on the same scale as before the frost commenced, and there is no doubt that should the present mild weather continue, <num value="10000">10,000</num> workmen and labourers, in addition to those who have been taken on in the course of the last <num value="3">three</num> days, will resume their industrial occupations. Mr. Selfe announced that, for obvious reasons, there would be a discontinuance of the general relief of the poor after to-morrow evening, and that he should attend to no applications for temporary relief (urgent and pressing cases of want excepted) unless the applicants produced <num value="1">one</num> of the printed forms issued by the court, properly filled up by some honourable and trustworthy gentleman known; and he expected, before they recommended any <num value="1">one</num>, they would make themselves personally responsible by visiting, and inquiries about the applicant's position, character, cause of distress, and number of family. 
<p>Mr. Selfe relieved upwards of <num value="100">100</num> destitute persons. In the course of the last <num value="5">five</num> weeks his labours have been often protracted until nearly midnight. He has opened upwards of <num value="4000">4,000</num> letters recommending deserving persons as objects of temporary relief, examined <num value="3000">3,000</num> printed forms, received numerous clergymen of all creeds, committees, laymen, and others soliciting, and has been engaged day after day in <pb id="p.328" n="328"> correspending with various persons on the necessities of the district. 
<p>The amount received and distributed at this court during the month of <datestruct VALUE="1861-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>, was about <measure value="3000l." type=currency><num value="3000">3,000</num>l.</measure>

Sergeant Gee, of the H division, brought a wretchedlooking man into court for assistance under these circumstances:--It appeared that, at an early hour that morning, some market people engaged in Spitalfields saw the old man standing with a basket on his head. Suddenly he fell to the ground, was picked up, and taken to the station-house. The immediate attendance of Dr. Edmunds, the divisional surgeon, restored him, and that gentleman then announced that the patient was perishing for want of sustenance. This was, of course, at once afforded, and when able he was brought to this court. 
<p>The poor creature stated that he was <num value="82">eighty-two</num> years of age, lived by carrying heavy loads in the market, but he had not had food for many hours. 
<p>The sergeant said he had visited the old man's lodging in Bowl-court, Shoreditch, where he found a young girl, a niece with a piece of bread she had procured from the workhouse for her relative. 
<p>Mr. Knox ordered instant relief in this instance. <pb id="p.329" n="329"> 
<p><hi rend=italics><datestruct VALUE="0-01-19"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=19>19th</day></datestruct></hi>, <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.-Again Mr. Knox devoted hours to inquiries into applications for relief from the poor-box fund, and the minute questioning of this worthy gentleman elicited much that was satisfactory on <num value="1">one</num> hand, and most distressing on the other. A large sum is now laid out in the purchase of coals and bread, which is supplied by tickets, and this is essentially the most prudent course to pursue. Despite the relief that has been bestowed, hundreds flock to the doors of this court, bearing with them indisputable evidence of sickness and destitution. Mr. Knox took the opportunity of observing that above <num value="300">300</num> letters were received daily on behalf of the bearers, and there were but <num value="4">four</num> persons to open them. Under such circumstances, all he could do was to devote every minute possible to spare from the general business to their consideration. This evening great difficulty was experienced in clearing the court from those applicants who asserted that they had been in waiting day after day --some weeping, and others seeming resolved to remain. 
<p><hi rend=italics><datestruct VALUE="0-01-23"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=23>23rd</day></datestruct></hi>, <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>.-Mr. Knox, at the conclusion of the day's business, made the following remarks relative to the disposal of the poor-box funds, and the district over which he presided :-- <QUOTE>The course I and my colleague, Mr. Leigh, have followed, has been this-the district has been divided into <num value="4">four</num> portions for the purpose of facilitating the duty of serving warrants, summonses, notices, and such like, and <num value="1">one</num> officer is appointed to the charge of each of these portions. Now each of these officers, Farrall, Bull, Haynes, and Edis, at the end of a long and heavy day's work in the court, <pb id="p.330" n="330"> has each night visited the homes of as many poor persons as he could at all accomplish in the time, reporting the result of each visit to the magistrate the next day, and in every case which he has so verified adequate relief in money and bread has been immediately granted. And here I should be very imperfectly discharging a moral duty if I did not most sincerely render my cordial thanks to those officers, for their exertions have been not only willingly made, but the extra duties so imposed upon them, trying and arduous as they were, have proved most effective and satisfactory. Indeed, I may truly say that, without their assistance, the vast amount of relief granted to the starving population of this district would have been entirely lost sight of. Every shilling disbursed has been so after a house to house visitation by them, and my most sincere thanks are due for the services they have rendered me. The chief destitution of this district appears to me to have fallen upon <num value="3">three</num> great classes-dockyard labourers, shoemakers, and weavers. The thaw which has now set in may be the means of at once restoring the <num value="2">two</num> former, but, with regard to the Spitalfields weavers, it is different, I greatly fear. I am informed that in this district alone there are <num value="20000">20,000</num> persons who follow this trade, their average earnings being only from <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">7</num>s.</measure> to <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> per week, and for <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> weeks past these have been almost entirely deprived of all occupation. Whether the system of relief by police-courts is to become <num value="1">one</num> of the regular duties of such tribunals is not a point upon which I as <num value="1">one</num> of the younger magistrates upon the bench can express any opinion. I only trust that we may receive some positive rule for our own <pb id="p.331" n="331"> guidance, which may enable us to carry the business through in a proper and efficient manner, or that we may be enabled to state to the public that it is considered injudicious that police magistrates should be any longer charged with such a responsibility. The relief given by this court has been partly in the form of bread, coals, and blankets, and part in sums of ready money, and I most sincerely hope that a real amount of good has been effected with as small as possible a per-centage of that rascality and imposition which is and ever must be inseparable from such proceedings. The number of cases attended to since about the <datestruct VALUE="0-12-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, when the frost set in with such severity, I find to embrace no less than <num value="1400">one thousand four hundred</num> persons, and this, taking the usual average number that families are found to consist of, gives a total number so assisted over want and starvation of about <num value="5600">5,600</num> persons, who, but for the funds so left at our disposal, must have been left to themselves in misery and want.</QUOTE>

Upwards of <num value="100">one hundred</num> letters of recommendation were opened and examined, and although some were evidently attempted impositions, and others from interested persons, such as landlords, bakers, and other tradesmen with whom the poor people dealt, <pb id="p.332" n="332"> the number relieved with amounts, varying, according to circumstances, from <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> to <measure value="1l." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>l.</measure>, or <measure value="1l." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>l.</measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> each, was between <num value="80">eighty</num> and <num value="90">ninety</num>.

The magistrate kindly advised her to go into the union; but, like all the respectable poor, she entertained an aversion to entering an institution which would have separated her from her helpless son. She said she had <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> per week from the parish, and if she could obtain a trifle to help her over the bad weather, she would attend her son <QUOTE>very carefully,</QUOTE> and work for both.

<p>Alderman Allen very carefully investigated every case in which the applicant came with a letter of recommendation from some respectable person known to the court, and whose position placed such person above the influence of interested motives; but from the number of poor who were arriving in a continuous stream throughout the afternoon, it became obvious that it would be utterly impossible to relieve them all, and the magistrate, therefore, after he had assisted about <num value="70">seventy</num> of those who appeared the most deserving with small sums, according to the circumstances of their cases, <pb id="p.333" n="333"> announced publicly that the remainder of the applications could not be attended to unless the parties came better recommended. He wished also to impress upon the poor people who came here for charity that he could not accept the recommendation of a landlord or petty tradesman, as he feared that such recommendations were more often given with the view of settling back scores and arrears of rent rather than that of satisfying the craving appetites of the starving tenants and their famished children, and it was evident that this rule could not be too widely known or too rigidly adhered to, as he had already noticed some half-dozen names of persons, landlords of small tenements, who had issued their recommendations wholesale.

The worthy alderman was engaged from <num value="1">one</num> until nearly <num value="6">six</num> o'clock in the evening, during which nearly <num value="300">three hundred</num> letters were opened; but although the suggestions thrown out on the previous day with regard to the class of persons from whom letters of recommendation should be obtained had been complied with to a very considerable extent, there were yet a vast number whose recommendations were unavailable in consequence of the writers not occupying any of the positions which would bring them within the knowledge of the magistrate or the officials connected with this court. Notwithstanding the intimation from the bench that any <num value="1">one</num> recommended by inspectors of police would be certainly relieved, not more than <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> have <pb id="p.334" n="334"> been received, and in the course of the afternoon Inspector Cole explained that the class of deserving persons that they generally came in contact with were not without friends, to whom their <num value="1">first</num> application for a recommendation would naturally be made; but there was another class of persons, if anything, more deserving --equally respectable, but suffering from destitution far beyond what any <num value="1">one</num> unacquainted with them could conceive. A class of persons neither seeking nor receiving relief either from the parish or private individuals, except their own friends, and who would rather exist upon a crust of dry bread or starve than venture to supplicate alms of a stranger.

The alms given away during the past week amounted to nearly <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure>; but to continue assistance at the same rate for <num value="1">one</num> day would be sufficient to swallow up the remaining balance in hand. A notice was posted up outside the court stating that no relief would be given that day, but that all letters of recommendation might be left, which would be examined, and those who were deserving, after due inquiry into their cases, would be relieved at their homes, which had the effect of dispersing a crowd of strong, able-bodied Irishmen who have assembled during the last few days, and kept back many of the deserving English poor by force, in order that their countrywomen might be relieved before the money ran short.

It was found necessary to confine the distribution to the City poor belonging to this district, as, in many instances, the parties relieved at this court proceeded immediately after and endeavoured to get relief at the Mansion House, and those relieved <pb id="p.336" n="336"> at the Mansion House repeated their application at this court.

During the day no less than <num value="250">250</num> distressed women were relieved with various sums, amounting in the aggregate to between <measure value="70l." type=currency><num value="70">70</num>l.</measure> and <measure value="80l." type=currency><num value="80">80</num>l.</measure>, but although this number is greater than the numbers who have hitherto been relieved at this court in <num value="1">one</num> day, it must not be taken as a fair criterion of the actual amount of distress now existing. Hundreds of families have within the last <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> weeks been relieved.

Yesterday no less than <num value="300">300</num> applied for assistance, and after strict inquiries had been made, all who were found deserving received, to the number of <num value="180">180</num>, sufficient for the relief of their present wants.

During the last few weeks no less than <num value="3000">3,000</num> persons had been relieved from the funds so liberally supplied by the benevolent public, all cases having <num value="1">first</num> <pb id="p.338" n="338"> been strictly inquired into. No case of distress had been brought to that court that had not received the fullest investigation, and the result went to show that while there were a great number of cases of extreme distress, there had been also a great many cases which were totally undeserving. He was sorry to state that even now there were still a vast number of applicants, and probably there might be some few who might require to be attended to, and he should for the next <num value="2">two</num> days continue to relieve those who were really in distress, and whose cases would bear investigation, and that after that he should not consider it necessary to afford relief except in cases of the most urgent necessity. 
<p>The sum received and distributed at this court during the month of <datestruct VALUE="1861-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>, was nearly <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">2,000</num>l.</measure> At the Southwark police-court, during the same period, nearly <measure value="1400l." type=currency><num value="1400">1,400</num>l.</measure> was received and distributed, and at the Westminster police-court about <measure value="850l." type=currency><num value="850">850</num>l.</measure>, besides coals, soup, and bread were distributed to about <num value="2000">2,000</num> applicants.
