<P>Where   <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.1.1">Fishmongers' Hall</LEMMA>, that handsome Anglo-Greek building at the west side of the foot of London Bridge still stands this rich semi-marine Company have had    a stronghold ever since the reign of Edward III.   It was in   this convenient spot also, that that most warlike and eminent of Fishmongers, Sir William Walworth,   himself resided during   the reign of Richard II., the monarch whose crown he saved by a single blow of his prompt sword. 
<P>Mr. Herbert, who took great pains about this question, says that there were originally <num value="5">five</num> tenements on the site of Fishmongers' Hall. The frontage towards Thames Street was <num value="120">120</num> feet, and the depth to the river about <num value="200">200</num>   feet.   The plot of ground stood in Upper Thames Street,   between the Water Gate and Old Swan Lane, and   lay in <num value="3">three</num> parishes. It was parted into <num value="6">six</num> great slips   by <num value="5">five</num> stairs to the Thames, as seen in <QUOTE>The Exact Survey of the   Ruins of London after the Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> The stairs were--Water Gate (originally called Oyster Hill,   and afterwards   the Gully Hole),   the site of the old water works, Churchyard Alley,   Fleur de Luce Alley, <pb id="P.2" n="2"> Black Raven Alley, and Ebgate (Old Swan Lane), and after the Fire, Wheatsheaf Alley. 
<P>Henry III., in order to increase, his queen's customs at Queenhithe (Thames Street), prohibited any fish being landed from fishing-vessels except at that port.   This led to a great London fishmarket being established in Old Fish Street (near Doctors' Commons), and Knightrider Street soon became famous, as Stow tells us, for fish dinners. The stalls soon grew into houses, and this is why St. Nicholas Coleabbey contained the tombs of so many celebrated Fishmongers. 
<P>Edward I., finding the old restrictions work badly, restored the Fishmongers to their ancient liberty, and in the next reign they removed to Bridge Street, thenceforward called   New Fish Street. Here the Fishmongers could correspond with Billingsgate, and their other colonies at Fish Wharf, Oyster Gate, and Eastcheap. <QUOTE>The topping men,</QUOTE> says   Stow, <QUOTE>lived in Bridge Street.</QUOTE> The Stock Market was also an early fish-market; in <datestruct value="1545--"><year reg="1545">1545</year></datestruct> there were <num value="25">25</num> fishmongers there, and only <num value="18">18</num> butchers. After the change of market all the great Fishmonger   mayors and aldermen were buried at St. Magnus' and St. Botolph's, while the Stock Fishmongers took a fancy to the cool vaults of St. Michael's, Crooked Lane. 
<P>Herrings, says Herbert, are mentioned, soon after the Conquest, and in the <num value="31">31st</num> of Edward III. they had become fish of such importance, that a special Act of Parliament was passed relating to them. Whales accidentally stranded on our inhospitable coasts in that reign were instantly salted down and sent to the king for his consumption.   As for porpoises, they were favourites with English cooks till after Elizabeth's reign. 
<P>Edward I. seems to have been a fish-loving king, for he fixed a tariff of prices. The edict limits the best soles to <measure value="3d." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>d.</measure> a dozen; the best turbot to <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> the best mackerel, in   Lent, to   <measure value="1d." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>d.</measure> each; the best pickled herrings to <num value="20">twenty</num> the penny; fresh oysters to <measure value="2d." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>d.</measure> per gallon; a quarter of a <num value="100">hundred</num> of the best eels to <measure value="2d." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>d.</measure>; and other fish in proportion. <QUOTE>Congers, lampreys, and sea-hogs</QUOTE> are enumerated. 
<P>The same King Edward, the born plague of fishmongers and Scotchmen, forbade all partnerships with foreign fishmongers, and all storing fish in cellars to retail afterwards at exorbitant rates. No fishmonger was to buy before the king's purveyors, and no fish (unless salted) was to be kept in London beyond the <num value="2">second</num> day. The City had limited the profit of the London fishmonger to a penny in the shilling; moreover, no <num value="1">one</num> was to sell fish except in the open market-place, and no <num value="1">one</num> was permitted to water fish more than twice, under pain of fines and the market-place stocks. 
<P>In the reign of Edward II. all the-London fishmongers had their stalls in Bridge Street, a market of a later date than Billingsgate and Old Fish Street. In the reign of Richard II. the Stock Fishmongers formed a new company, and had a hall of their own to the east of the Fishmongers'. The <num value="2">two</num> companies united in the reign of Henry VI., and held their meetings at Lord Fairhope's house in Thames Street. The restless Stock Fishmongers again seceded in the reign of Henry VII.; but in the reign of Henry VIII. the <num value="2">two</num> companies were again finally, fused together, and on this occasion Lord Fairhope's hall saw cups of wine drained to the happy union. 
<P>The great tenant of Fishmongers' Hall in the reign of Edward III. was John Lovekyn, who was several times Lord Mayor of London. At the death of Lovekyn's   wife the celebrated William Walworth lived there, and carried on his honest but unheroic business of stock fishmonger, a great trade in Catholic times, when fish was in demand for frequent fast-days. To Walworth succeeded William Askham, <num value="1">one</num> of his apprentices, and twice Mayor of London. The building is then spoken of as having a wharf, a loft, and a tower which Walworth had built. 
<P>The Fishmongers must have been wealthy in the reign of Edward III., when they contributed <measure value="40l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40">40</num></measure> towards the expenses of the French warsonly- <measure value="1l." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> less than the Mercers, the grandest: Company; and <num value="2">two</num> years later they again contributed the same sum. In the <num value="50">50th</num> Edward III., the Fishmongers ranked the <num value="4">fourth</num> Company, as at present, and returned <num value="6">six</num> members to the common council, the greatest number any guild sent. 
<P>In spite of Walworth's <QUOTE>swashing blow</QUOTE> and loyal service, the reign of Richard II. proved a vexatious <num value="1">one</num> to   the Fishmongers.   John de Northampton, Mayor in <datestruct value="1380--"><year reg="1380">1380</year></datestruct>, obtained an Act of Parliament to entirely throw open the trade, and compelled the Fishmongers to admit that their occupation was no craft, and unworthy to be reckoned among the mysteries. He also went further, for in the year <datestruct value="1382"><year reg="1382">1382</year></datestruct> Parliament, indignant at the frauds of Billingsgate, enacted that in future no Fishmonger should be admitted Mayor of London. This prohibition was removed next year, when the Fishmongers pleaded their own cause in Parliament.   During this discussion the Fishmongers prayed for the king's protection from <QUOTE>corporal hurt,</QUOTE> and pleaded malice in their accusers. Upon which John Moore, a Mercer, angrily charged Walter Sybell, a spokesman of the Fishmongers, <pb id="P.3" n="3"> with having let the rebels of Kent and Essex, Wat Tyler's followers, into the City. This same Walter, a violent and rash man, was, by-the-bye, afterwards fined <num value="500">500</num>   marks for slandering   Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford. Even in <datestruct value="1383--"><year reg="1383">1383</year></datestruct> the anti-Fishmonger agitation still continued, for we find John Cavendish, a Fishmonger, challenging the Chancellor for taking a bribe   of <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure>   in the fore-named case. The Chancellor freed himself by    oath on the Sacrament, and John Cavendish, being found guilty, was sentenced to pay the Chancellor, <measure value="1000bmark" type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num> marks</measure>, and was also sent to prison. 
<P>Herbert says that the Fishmongers were amongst the earliest of the metropolitan guilds.   They were <num value="1">one</num> of those amerced in the reign   of Henry II.; and we have seen that charters were granted to them   not only by Edward II.; Edward III.,   and Richard II., but by Edward   I. They were fined <num value="500">500</num>   marks as a guild, in the   <num value="18">18th</num> of the latter prince, for forestalling, contrary to   the laws and constitutions of the City, and   it was soon afterwards found   necessary to make fresh regulations for them, which are to be found in the   <title lang=la>Liber Horn.</title>   These, amongst other things, ordain <QUOTE>that no fishmonger shall buy fish beyond the bounds 
<FIGURE id="Fig.003" n="2000.07.0003"><HEAD>The Neighbourhood Of London Bridge. From Hollar's View. (See Page <num value="4">4</num>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 appointed--namely, the chapel on London Bridge, Baynard's Castle, and Jordan's Key,</QUOTE> This was to prevent their going and meeting the boats before their arrival at London. <QUOTE>No fish were to be brought in any boat without <num value="1">first</num> being landed at the chapel on the bridge; fresh fish was   only to be sold after mass, and salt fish after prime.</QUOTE> <num value="8">Eight</num> years later--viz., in <datestruct value="1298--"><year reg="1298">1298</year></datestruct>--the Company displayed their great wealth by meeting the brave king, Edward. I., on his return from Scotland,  with very splendid retinue and costly trappings. We have already (Vol. I., p. <num value="305">305</num>) noticed a great affray which took place between   the Fishmongers and the Skinners, in the midst of Cheapside   in <datestruct value="1340--"><year reg="1340">1340</year></datestruct>, which ended in the apprehension and execution, by the mayor, of several of the   ringleaders.   These quarrels were common amongst the great companies in early times; and in the above, and most other instances, arose from disputed claims about precedency,   which were   uniformly settled by the Court of Aldermen.   Stow's allusion to the ancient amity between the Fishmongers and Goldsmiths, which he charges former with ignorance for not knowing, but which he himself has not explained, was the consequence of   <num value="1">one</num> of these decisions, <pb id="P.4" n="4"> which were always accompanied by orders for them to alternately take precedence, dine together, exchange livery hoods, and other methods calculated to make them friends, as will be shown to have been the case in both instances. The Fishmongers and Goldsmiths have no commemoration of this amity at present; but the Skinners (who were similarly reconciled after the above affray, of which a notice will also be seen in the account of that Company), when members of their courts dine with each other, drink as toasts the <QUOTE>Merchant Taylors and Skinners,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>Skinners and Merchant Taylors.</QUOTE> 
<P>When Alderman Wood, as prime warden of the Company, was examined before the Commissioners of Municipal Inquiry, he stated that till the year <datestruct value="1830"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct> only <num value="8">eight</num> liverymen were made a year, but that year (for election purposes) <num value="400">400</num> liverymen had been elected, on signing a declaration foregoing all rights to dine in hall. The fee for coming on the livery was then <measure value="25l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="25">25</num></measure>, the purchase-money of the freedom <num value="105">105</num>;   and for translation from another Company double that sum. 
<P>The Fishmongers' books do not extend far enough back to give any account of their ancient livery. For many years the Goldsmiths and Fishmongers, as proof of amity, exchanged each others' liveries. 
<P>Every year, on the festival of their patron saint, St. Peter, all the brethren and <QUOTE>sustern</QUOTE> of the fraternity went in their new livery to St. Peter's Church, Cornhill, and there heard a solemn mass in the worship of God and St. Peter, and offered at offering-time whatever their devotion prompted them. They kept <num value="3">three</num> priests to celebrate obits, which was <num value="1">one</num> more than is mentioned in any other Company. The ancient custom of electing wardens is still retained by this Company. A sort of cap, fronted with a metal plate, is placed successively on the head of each new warden. 
<P>The <num value="2">second</num> Fishmongers' Hall, though usually ascribed to Sir Christopher Wren, was built by a Mr. Jerman, who was also the architect of Drapers' Hall and the <num value="2">second</num> Royal Exchange.   Old Fishmongers'. Hall was a stately structure, particularly the front towards the river, of which it commanded a very fine view. The Thames Street front was a mere cluster of houses; the entrance, however, was pleasing. It was ornamented with sculptured pilasters, sustaining an open pediment, which had the Company's arms carved in bold relief. The buildings environed a square court, handsomely paved. The dining-hall formed the south side of the court, and was a spacious and lofty apartment, having, besides the usual accompaniment of a screen of Grecian architecture, a capacious gallery running round the whole interior, and a statue of Sir William Walworth, said by Walpole to have been carved by an artist named Pierce. The rooms for business lay on the west side of the court, and those for courts and withdrawing at entertainments on the east, which were ornamented with many rich decorations, and paintings of a great variety of fish, not easy to be described. 
<P>In Hollar's large <num value="4">four</num>-sheet view of London,. <datestruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct>, we perceive <num value="2">two</num> courtyards, evidently formed by running a dining-hall, or refectory-high-roofed. and turreted, like that of Westminster-across the original quadrangle.   This view also affords a good representation of the Thames front, which appears of an irregular form and unornamental, but to have been at <num value="1">one</num> time regular and handsome.   It consists of <num value="2">two</num> wings and a receding centre, the latter having a balcony at the <num value="1">first</num> floor, double rows of windows, a lofty octagonal tower or staircase rising above the roof, and crowned with a sort of cupola; there was also a large arched doorway leading to a small terrace on the Thames, similar to the present house. The wings were evidently, when perfect, uniform square towers, harmonising with the centre; but only the western <num value="1">one</num> here remains in its original state, the eastern <num value="1">one</num> being modernised and roofed like a common house. 
<P>In De Hogenberg's earlier plan of London, Fishmongers' Hall appears as a square pile of masonry,. with embattled parapets, towers at the angles, a central gateway, and steps leading from the river to <num value="1">one</num> of the side towers. 
<P>In no worse spot in all London could the Great Fire have broken out than Pudding Lane.   It found there stores of oil, hemp, flax, pitch, tar, cordage, hops, wines, brandies, and wharves for coal and timber. Fishmongers' Hall was the <num value="1">first</num>. great building consumed when, as Dryden says, in <num value="2">two</num> splendid lines, 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>A key of fire ran all along the shore, 
<L>And frightened all the river with a blaze.</QUOTE>
 The building on the river-side was reduced to a shell. Even the hall itself, which was at the back, with a high roof and turret, was entirely destroyed, as well as <num value="2">two</num> sets of stairs, and the houses round the Old Swan and Black Raven Alley. After the Fire, the building committee met at Bethlehem Hospital.   Sir William   Davenant (Shakespeare's supposed son), describing this part of London before the Great Fire, says: <QUOTE>Here a palace, there a wood-yard; here a garden, there a brewhouse; here dwelt a lord, there a dyer; and between both duomo commune.</QUOTE> A   strange, picturesque <pb id="P.5" n="5">

<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.5.5">The present Fishmongers' Hall</LEMMA>,   at the northwest foot of London Bridge (says      Timbs), was rebuilt by Roberts in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>-<num value="33">33</num>, and is the <num value="3">third</num> of the Company's halls nearly on this site.   It is raised upon a lofty basement cased with granite, and contains fire-proof warehouses, which yield a large rental.   The river front has a balustraded terrace, and a Grecian-Ionic hexastyle and pediment. The east or entrance front is enriched by pilasters and columns, and the arms of the Company and crest.   The entrance-hall is separated from the great staircase by a screen of polished Aberdeen granite columns; and at the head of the stairs is Pierce's statue of Sir William Walworth   a Fishmonger, who carries dagger.   In his hand was formerly a real dagger, said to be the identical weapon with which he stabbed Wat Tyler, though, in <datestruct value="1731--"><year reg="1731">1731</year></datestruct>, a publican   of Islington pretended to possess the actual poniard.   Beneath the statue is this inscription:  -- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Brave Walworth, Knight, Lord Mayor, yt slew 
<L>Rebellious Tyler in his alarmes; 
<L>The King, therefore, did give in liew

<P>A common but erroneous belief was thus propagated; for the dagger was in the City arms long before the time of Sir William   Walworth, and was intended to represent the sword   of St. Paul, the patron saint of the Corporation.   The reputed dagger    of   Walworth, which   has    lost its guard, is preserved by the Company. The workmanship is no doubt that of Walworth's period.          The weapon now in the hand of the statue (which is somewhat picturesque, and within recollection was coloured 
<hi rend=italics>en costume</hi>) is modern. 
<P>Amongst celebrated Fishmongers and their friends we must mention Isaac Pennington, the turbulent Lord Mayor of the Civil War under Charles I.; and Dogget, the comedian and Whig, who bequeathed a sum of money for the purchase of a <QUOTE>coat and badge,</QUOTE> to be rowed for every <datestruct value="08-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct> from   the <QUOTE>Swan</QUOTE> at London Bridge to the <QUOTE>Swan</QUOTE> at Battersea, in remembrance of George I.'s accession to the throne. 
<P>In Fishmongers' Hall there is an original drawing of a portion of the pageant exhibited by the Fishmongers' Company on the <datestruct VALUE="1616-10-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1616">1616</year></datestruct>, on the occasion of Sir John Leman, a member of the Company, entering on the office of Lord Mayor of the City of London, and the following portraits: William III. and queen, by Murray; George II. and queen, by Schakleton; Dukes of Kent and Sussex, by Beechey; Earl St. Vincent(the admiral), by Beechey; Queen Victoria, by Herbert Smith; the Margrave of Anspach and Margravine, by G. Rowney; the late Lord Chancellor Hatherley, by Wells. 
<P> <QUOTE>The Fishmongers,</QUOTE> says Herbert, <QUOTE>have no wardens' accounts or minutes of an earlier date than <datestruct value="1592--"><year reg="1592">1592</year></datestruct>, their more ancient ones having been either destroyed in the Fire of London or otherwise lost. The title-deeds of their various estates commence as far back as <num value="9">9</num> Edward III., and are finely preserved, as are also their Book of Ordinances and some other ancient documents relating to the Company. The minutes remaining-or, as they are termed in this Company, <Q>court ledgers</Q>--consist of <num value="8">eight</num> folio volumes, separately dated.</QUOTE> 
<P>The Fishmongers' greatest curiosity is their pall, commonly although erroneously described as <QUOTE>Walworth's pall;</QUOTE> it is in <num value="3">three</num> pieces, like the famous pall of the Merchant Taylors, and exactly resembles in shape <num value="1">one</num> belonging to the Saddlers' --namely, that of a cross. It consists of a centre slip, about     <num value="12">12</num> feet long and <num value="2.50">2 1/2</num> feet wide, and <num value="2">two</num> shorter   sides, each <num value="8">8</num> feet <num value="11">11</num> inches long by <num value="1">1</num> foot <num value="4">4</num> inches wide, and when laid over a corpse must have totally enveloped the   coffin, but without corner falls, like our modern palls. In the style of ornament, workmanship, and materials, this is <num value="1">one</num> of the most superb works   of its kind of ancient art, and in this country, as a relic of the   old Catholic faith, has probably no parallel. The pattern of the central part is a sprig, or running flower, which is composed of gold network, bordered with red, and the whole of which reposes on a smooth, solid ground of cloth of gold.   The end pieces and side borders to this middle slip are worked in different pictures and representations.   The end pieces consist of a very rich and massy wrought picture, in gold and silk, of the patron, St. Peter, in <hi rend=italics>pontificalibus.</hi>
 He is seated on a superb throne, his head crowned with the sacred tiara. <num value="1">One</num> hand holds the keys; the other is in the position of giving the benediction. On each side of the saint is a kneeling angel, censing him with <num value="1">one</num> hand, and holding a sort of golden vase with the other. Each of these end pieces is perfectly similar; and the materials, which are beautifully worked, are of gold and silk. The angels' wings, according to the old custom in such representations, are composed of peacocks' feathers, in all their natural vivid colours. The outer robes are gold, raised with crimson; their under-vests white, shaded with   sky-blue.   The faces are finely worked in satin, after nature; and they have long yellow hair. St. Peter's vest, or under-robe, is crimson, raised with gold; the <pb id="P.6" n="6"> inside of the hanging sleeve of his outer robe, or coat, azure, powdered with gold stars. A golden nimbus, or rather glory, encircles his head; and in his lap is placed   an open book, having the following inscription in old English black-letter on a silver ground: <quote lang=la>Credo in Deum Patrem,   Omnipotentem,</QUOTE> at the <num value="1">one</num> end piece; and at the other similarly, <QUOTE lang=la>Credo in Deum Patrem, omnium.</QUOTE>  The pictures of the side pieces are divided into <num value="3">three</num> compartments. The centre is Christ delivering the keys to Peter, the latter of whom is kneeling, and habited as in the end pieces, but with only a glory encircling the head, and no crown (he not being crowned Prince of the Apostles).   The Saviour is habited agreeably to the usual representations of him   as regards costume. His robe is crimson, raised with gold;   the inner vesture purple, and very rich. Around the head is a superb circular glory, jewelled and coronetted.   He graciously stoops to deliver the <num value="2">two</num> golden keys of heaven and hell with <num value="1">one</num> hand; while with the other he poises the golden orb of sovereignty, surmounted with   the   cross. A   label proceeding from   the   mouth has inscribed, in black-letter and on a silver ground, as before: 
<FIGURE id="Fig.006" n="2000.07.0004"><HEAD>The <num value="2">Second</num> Fishmongers' Hall (See Page <num value="4">4</num>)</HEAD></FIGURE>. 
<QUOTE lang=la>Tibi dabo Claves Regum   Coelo'm.</QUOTE>   Both figures stand in a beautiful arched recess, within Gothic-pinnacled buildings and ornaments.   On each side of this middle picture (which is the same on both sides) the decorations   are made up of the Fishmongers' arms, richly and properly emblazoned.   The supporters (merman and mermaid) are worked in their natural colours.   The merman wears gold armour. The mermaid's body is of white silk thread, beautifully worked; her long tresses of golden thread. A. superb jewel hangs by a gold chain from   her neck.   Her mirror reflects a head like that of Christ or St. Peter. The entire pall has a fringe <num value="2">two</num> inches deep of gold and purple silk threads, and is lined inside with black silk. The weight of the whole, owing to the quantity of gold and silver worked into it, is very considerable; and it is in the finest preservation. 
<P>The Saddlers' Company also still have a valuable pall, though not so costly. It is of crimson velvet. The centre is of yellow silk, forming an   elegant sprig pattern.

The pageants have inscriptions over them in the handwriting of the time, from   which we   learn   that it was the custom to suspend them from the roof of the hall when done with, for future solemnities.

<P>The churchyard of St. Leonard marks the site of a church of no interest destroyed by the Great Fire. Many of the Doggets were buried there.

<P>There are few spots in London where, within a very limited and strictly-defined space, so many historical events have happened, as on Old London Bridge. It was a battle-field and a place of religious worship, a resort of traders and a show-place for traitors' heads. Its Nonsuch House was <num value="1">one</num> of the sights. of London in the reign of Elizabeth; and the passage between its arches was <num value="1">one</num> of the exploits of venturous youth, down to the very time. of its removal. Though never beautiful or stately, London Bridge was <num value="1">one</num> of those sights that visitors to the metropolis never forgot. 
<P>There is no certain record of when the <num value="1">first</num> London Bridge was built.   It is true that Dion Cassius, writing nearly <num value="200">two hundred</num> years after the invasion of Britain by Claudius, speaks vaguely of a bridge across the Thames in the reign of that emperor; but it is more probable that no bridge really existed till the year <datestruct value="994"><year reg="994">994</year></datestruct>, the year after the invasion of Olaf the Dane, in the reign of King Ethelred. It is at least certain that in the year <datestruct value="1008"><year reg="1008">1008</year></datestruct>, in the reign of Ethelred II., the Unready, there was a bridge, for, according to Snorro Sturlesonius, an Icelandic historian, Olaf the Norwegian, an ally of Ethelred, attacking the Danes who had fortified themselves in Southwark, fastened his vessels to the piles of London Bridge, which the Danes held, and dragged down the whole structure. This Olaf, afterwards a martyr, is the patron saint from whom the church now standing at the south-east corner of London Bridge, derived its Christian name. Tooley Street below, a word corrupted from Saint Olave, also preserves the memory of the Norwegian king, eventually slain near Drontheim by Knut, King of Denmark. 
<P>Still, whenever the churchwardens and vestry of St. Mary Overie's, Bankside, meet over their cups, the <num value="1">first</num> toast, says an antiquary who has written an exhaustive history of London Bridge, is to their church's patron saint, <QUOTE>Old Moll.</QUOTE> This Old Moll was, according to Stow, Mary, the daughter of a ferryman at this part of the river, who left all her money to build a house of sisters, where the east part of St. Mary Overie's now stands. In time the nunnery became a house of priests, who erected the <num value="1">first</num> wooden bridge over the Thames. There is still existing at the Church of St. Mary Overie's a skeleton effigy, which some declare to be that of Audery, the ferryman, father of the immortal Moll. The legend was that this John Overy, or Audery, was a rich and covetous man, penurious, and insanely fond of hoarding his hard-earned fees. He had a pious and beautiful daughter, who, though kept in seclusion by her father, was loved by a young gallant, who secretly wooed and won her. <num value="1">One</num> day the old hunks, to save a day's food, resolved to feign himself dead for <num value="24">twenty-four</num> hours, vainly expecting that his servants, from common decency, would fast till his funeral. With his daughter's help he therefore laid himself out, wrapped in a sheet, with <num value="1">one</num> taper burning at his feet, and another at his head. The lean, halfstarved servants, however, instead of lamenting their master's decease, leaped up overjoyed, danced round the body, broke open the larder, and fell to feasting. The old ferryman bore all this as long as flesh and blood could bear it, but at last he scrambled up in his sheet, a candle in each hand, to scold and chase the rascals from   the house; when <num value="1">one</num> of the boldest of them, thinking it was the devil himself, snatched up the butt-end of a broken oar, and struck out his master's brains. On hearing of this unintentional homicide, the lover came posting up to London so fast that his horse stumbled, and   the eager lover   alas! broke his neck. On this <num value="2">second</num> misfortune, Mary Overy, shrouding her beauty in a cowl, retired into a cloister for life. The corpse of the old miser was refused Christian burial, he being deemed by the clergy a wicked and excommunicated man; the friars of Bermondsey Abbey, however, in the absence of their father abbot, were bribed to give the body <QUOTE>a little earth, for charity.</QUOTE> The abbot on his return, enraged at the friars' cupidity, had the corpse dug up and thrown on the back of an ass, that was then turned out of the abbey gates.   The patient beast carried   the corpse up Kent Street, and shook it off under the gibbet near the small pond once called St. Thomas a Waterings, where it was roughly interred. The ferryman's effigy referred to <pb id="P.10" n="10"> before is really, as Gough, in his <QUOTE>Sepulchral Monuments,</QUOTE> says most of such figures are, the work of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century.   Now the real Audery, if he lived at all, lived long. before the Conquest, for the <num value="1">first</num> wooden bridge was, it is thought, probably built to stop the Danish piratevessels. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.10.1">The old wooden bridge</LEMMA> was destroyed by a terrific flood and storm, mentioned in the <title>Chronicle of Florence of Worcester,</title> which, in the year <datestruct value="1090"><year reg="1090">1090</year></datestruct>, blew down <num value="600">six hundred</num> London houses, and lifted the roof off Bow Church. In the <num value="2">second</num> year of Stephen a fire, that swept away all the wooden houses of London from Aldgate to St. Paul's, destroyed the <num value="2">second</num> wooden bridge. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.10.2">The <num value="1">first</num> stone London Bridge</LEMMA> was begun in <datestruct value="1176--"><year reg="1176">1176</year></datestruct>, by Peter, a priest and chaplain of St. Mary Colechurch, a building which, till the Great Fire made short work of it, stood in Conyhoop Lane, on the north side of the Poultry.   There long existed a senseless tradition that pious Peter of the Poultry reared the arches of his bridge upon woolpacks; the fact, perhaps, being that Henry II. generously gave towards the building a new tax levied upon his subjects' wool. Peter's bridge, which occupied <num value="33">thirty-three</num> years in its construction, boasted <num value="19">nineteen</num> pointed stone arches, and was <num value="926">926</num> feet long, and <num value="40">40</num> feet wide. It included a wooden drawbridge, and the piers were raised upon platforms (called starlings) of strong elm piles, covered by thick planks bolted together, that impeded the passage of barges. On <num value="1">one</num> of the piers was erected <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.10.3">a <num value="2">two</num>-storeyed chapel</LEMMA>, <num value="40">forty</num> feet high and <num value="60">sixty</num> feet long,   to <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.10.4">St. Thomas     a Becket</LEMMA>. 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.10.5">The lower chapel</LEMMA> could be entered either from   the chapel above or from the river, by a flight of stone stairs. The founder himself was buried under the chapel staircase.   Peter's bridge was partly destroyed by a great fire in <datestruct value="1212--"><year reg="1212">1212</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">four</num> years after it was finished, and while its stones were still sharp and white. There were even then houses upon it, and gate-towers; and many people crowding to help, or to see the sight, got wedged in between <num value="2">two</num> fires by a shifting of the wind, and being unable to escape, some <num value="3000">three thousand</num> were either burnt or drowned. 
<P>King John, after this, granted certain tolls, levied on foreign merchants, towards the bridge repairs. Henry III., according to a patent-roll dated from Portsmouth, <datestruct value="1252--"><year reg="1252">1252</year></datestruct>, permitted   certain monks, called the Brethren of London Bridge, with his especial sanction, to travel over England and collect alms. In this same reign (<datestruct value="1263--"><year reg="1263">1263</year></datestruct>) the bridge became the scene of great scorn and insult, shown by the turbulent citizens to Henry's queen, Eleanor of Provence, who was opposed to the people's friends, the barons, who were still contending for the final settlement of Magna Charta. As the queen and her ladies, in their gilded barge, were on their way to Windsor, and preparing to shoot the dangerous bridge, the rabble above assailed her with shouts and reproaches, and casting heavy stones and mud into her boat, at her and her bright-clothed maidens, drove them   back to the Tower, where the king was garrisoned. Towards the end of the same year, when Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, marched on London, the king and his forces occupied Southwark, and, to thwart the citizens, locked up the bridge-gates, and threw the ponderous keys into the Thames. But no locks can bar out Fate. The gates were broken open by a flood of citizens, the king was driven back, and Simon entered London. After the battle of Evesham, where the great earl fell, the king, perhaps remembering old grudges, took the halfruinous bridge into his own hands and delivered it over to the queen, who sadly neglected it. There were great complaints of this neglect in the reign of Edward I., and again the Holy Brothers went forth to collect alms throughout the land. The king gave lands also for the support of the bridgenamely, near the Mansion House, Old Change, and Ivy Lane. He also appointed tolls-every man on foot, with merchandise, to pay <num value="1">one</num> farthing; every horseman, <num value="1">one</num> penny; every pack carried on horseback, <num value="1">one</num> halfpenny. This same year (<datestruct value="1281"><year reg="1281">1281</year></datestruct>) <num value="4">four</num> arches of London Bridge were carried away by the   same thaw-flood that destroyed Rochester Bridge. 
<P>The reign of Edward I. was disgraced by the cruel revenge taken by the warlike monarch on <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.10.6">William Wallace</LEMMA>.   In <datestruct VALUE="1305-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1305">1305</year></datestruct> on Edward's return from the <num value="4">fourth</num> invasion of Scotland, <QUOTE>this man of Belial,</QUOTE> as Matthew of Westminster calls Wallace, was drawn on a sledge to Smithfield, there hanged, embowelled, beheaded, quartered, and his head set on a pole on London Bridge. An old ballad in the Harleian Collection, describing the execution of Simon Fraser, another Scotch guerilla leader, in the following year, concludes thus- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Many was the wives-chil&lsquo; that looked on him that day, 
<L>And said, Alas! that he was born, and so vilely forlorn, 
<L>So fierce man as he was. 
<L>Now stands the head above the town bridge, 
<L>Fast by Wallace, sooth for to say.</QUOTE>
 
<P>The heads of these <num value="2">two</num> Scotch patriots were, no doubt, placed side by side on the gate at the north or London end of the bridge. 
<P>The troublous reign of the young profligate, Richard II., brought more fighting to the bridge, for <pb id="P.11" n="11"> Wat Tyler and his fierce Kentish and Surrey men then came chafing to the gates which the Lord Mayor, William Walworth, had chained and barred, pulling up the drawbridge. Upon this the wild men shouted across to the wardens of the bridge to let it down, or they would destroy them all, and from sheer fear the wardens yielded.   Through that savage crowd the Brethren of the Bridge, as Thomas of Walsingham says, came passing with processions and prayers for peace. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1390--"><year reg="1390">1390</year></datestruct> fighting of a gayer and less bloodthirsty kind took place on the bridge. No dandy Eglinton tournament this, but a genuine grapple with spear, sword, and dagger. Sir David Lindsay, of Glenesk, who had married a daughter of Robert II., King of Scotland, challenged to the joust Lord Wells, our ambassador in Scotland, a man described by Andrew of Wyntoun, a poetical Scotch chronicler, as being 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Manful, stout, and of good pith, 
<L>And high of heart he was therewith.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Sir David arrived from   Scotland with twentynine attendants and <num value="30">thirty</num> horses.   The king presided at the. tournament. The arms Lindsay bore on his shield, banner, and trappings were gules, a fesse cheque argent and azure; those of Wells, or, a lion rampant, double queue, sable. At the <num value="1">first</num> shock the spears broke, and the crowd shouted that Lindsay was tied to his saddle.   The earl at that leaped off his charger, vaulted back, and dashed on to the collision.   At the <num value="3">third</num> crash Wells fell heavily, as if dead. In the final grapple Lindsay, fastening his dagger into the armour of the English knight, lifted him from the ground and dashed him, finally vanquished, to the earth. According to Andrew of Wyntoun, the king called out from   his <QUOTE>summer castle,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Good   cousin Lindsay, do forth that thou should do this day,</QUOTE> but the generous Scotchman threw   himself on Wells and embraced him till he revived. Nor did he stop there; during Wells's sickness of <num value="3">three</num> months Lindsay visited him in the gentlest manner, even like the most courteous companion, and did not omit <num value="1">one</num> day. <QUOTE>For he had fought,</QUOTE> says Boethius, <QUOTE>without anger, and but for glory.</QUOTE> And to commemorate that glorious St. George's day, the Scotch knight founded a chantry at Dundee, with a gift of <measure value="48bmark" type=currency><num value="48">forty-eight</num> marks</measure> (<measure value="32l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="32">32</num></measure>) yearly, for <num value="7">seven</num> priests and divers--virgins to sing anthems to the patron saint of England. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1392--"><year reg="1392">1392</year></datestruct>, when Richard II. returned to London, reconciled to the citizens, who had resented his reckless extravagance, London Bridge was the centre of splendid pageants. At the bridge-gate the citizens presented the handsome young scapegrace with a milk-white charger, caparisoned in cloth of gold and hung with silver bells, and gave the queen a white palfrey, caparisoned in white and red; while from every window hung cloths of gold and silver. The citizens ended by redeeming their forfeited charter by the outrageous payment of <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1396--"><year reg="1396">1396</year></datestruct>, when Richard had lost his <num value="1">first</num> queen, Anne of Bohemia, and married the child-daughter of Charles VI. of France, the crowd was so great to welcome the young queen, that at London Bridge <num value="9">nine</num> persons were crushed to death in the crowd.   The reign of Richard II. was indeed a memorable <num value="1">one</num> for London Bridge. 
<P>The year Richard II. was deposed, Henry of Lancaster laid rough hands on <num value="4">four</num> knights who had <num value="3">three</num> years before smothered the old Duke of Gloucester, by the king his nephew's commands. The murderers were dragged to Cheapside, and there had their hands lopped off at a fishmonger's stall. The heads were then spiked over the gate of London Bridge, and the bodies strung together on a gibbet. Nor did these heads long remain unaccompanied, for in <datestruct value="1407--"><year reg="1407">1407</year></datestruct>-<num value="8">8</num> Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, was beheaded, while Lord Bardolf, <num value="1">one</num> of his adherents who had joined in a northern insurrection, was quartered, and the earl's head and a flitch of unfortunate Bardolf were set up on London Bridge. 
<P>There was a great rejoicing on London Bridge when <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.12.1">Henry V.</LEMMA> returned with his long train of French captives from the red field of Agincourt, in <datestruct VALUE="1415-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1415">1415</year></datestruct>. The Mayor of London, with all the aldermen and crafts, in scarlet gowns and red and white hoods, welcomed him back to his capital; and   on the gate-tower stood a male and a female giant, the former having the keys of the City hanging from a staff, while trumpeters with horns and clarions sounded welcome to the conqueror of the French. In front of the gate was written, <QUOTE>The King's City of Justice.</QUOTE> On a column on <num value="1">one</num> side was an antelope, with a shield of the royal arms hanging round his neck, and holding a sceptre, which he offered to the king, in his right foot. On the opposite column stood a lion rampant, with the king's banner in his dexter claw. At the foot of the bridge rose a painted tower, with an effigy of St. George in complete armour in the midst, under a tabernacle. The saint's head was crowned with laurel interwoven with gems, and behind him   spread a tapestry emblazoned with escutcheons. The turrets, embossed with the royal arms, were plumed with banners. Across the tower ran <num value="2">two</num> scrolls, with the mottoes, <QUOTE>To God only be honour and glory,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>The streams of the river make glad the city of God.</QUOTE> In the house <pb id="P.12" n="12"> adjoining stood bright-faced children singing welcome to the king, accompanied by the melody of organs. The hero of Agincourt rode conspicuous above all on a courser trapped with parti-colours, <num value="1">one</num>-half blue velvet embroidered with antelopes (the arms of the De Bohun family) having large flowers springing between their horns. These trappings were afterwards utilised as copes for Westminster Abbey.

Brawls like this took place twice on London Bridge, and the proud and ambitious cardinal on <num value="1">one</num> occasion assembled his archers at his Bankside palace, and attempted to storm the bridge. 
<P>The dangers of <QUOTE>shooting</QUOTE> London Bridge were exemplified as early as <datestruct value="1428"><year reg="1428">1428</year></datestruct> (in the same reign- Henry VI.). <QUOTE>The barge of the Duke of Norfolk, starting from St. Mary Overie's, with many a gentleman, squire, and yeoman, about half-past <num value="4">four</num> of the clock on a November afternoon, struck (through bad steering) on a starling of London Bridge, and sank.</QUOTE> The duke and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> other gentlemen fortunately leaped on the piles, and so were saved by ropes cast down from the parapet above; the rest perished.

 a weaver of Abingdon, who had threatened to make priests' heads <QUOTE>as plentiful as sheep's heads,</QUOTE> was spiked upon the battlements. The very nextyear the child-king, Henry VI., who had been crowned at Notre Dame in <datestruct value="1431--"><year reg="1431">1431</year></datestruct>, entered London over this bridge. Lydgate, like a true laureate, careless who or what the new king might be, nibbed his ready pen, and was at it again with ready   verse.   At the drawbridge there was a tower, he says, hung with silk and arras, from which   issued   <num value="3">three</num>   empresses- Nature, Grace, and Fortune.

<L>At whose outcoming they gave such a light

 With these empresses came <num value="14">fourteen</num> maidens, all clad in white, who presented the king with gifts, and sang a roundel of welcome. 
<P>If Old London Bridge had a fault, it was, perhaps, its habit of occasionally partly falling down.   This it did as early as <datestruct value="1437"><year reg="1437">1437</year></datestruct>, when the great stone gate <pb id="P.14" n="14"> and tower on the Southwark end, with <num value="2">two</num> arches, subsided into the Thames. 
<P>There was another gala day for the bridge in <datestruct value="1445--"><year reg="1445">1445</year></datestruct>, when the proud and impetuous William de la Pole (afterwards Duke of Suffolk) brought over Margaret, daughter of Rene   (that weak, poetical monarch, immortalised in <title>Anne of Geierstein</title>), as a bride for the young King of England, and the City welcomed her on their river threshold.   The Duke of Gloucester, who had opposed the match, preceded her, with <num value="500">500</num> men clad in his ducal livery, and with gilt badges on their arms; and the mayor and aldermen rode on in scarlet, followed by the City companies in blue gowns and red hoods. Again Lydgate tuned his ready harp, and produced some certainly most unprophetic verses, in which he called the savage Margaret- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>The dove that brought the branch of peace,

<P>In <datestruct value="1450--"><year reg="1450">1450</year></datestruct>, and the very month after Margaret's favourite, De la Pole, had been seized in Dover Roads, and his head brutally chopped off on the side of a boat, the great insurrection under Jack Cade broke out in Kent. After routing a detachment of the royal troops at <num value="7">Seven</num> oaks, Cade marched towards London, and the commons of Essex mustering threateningly at Mile End, the City, after some debate, admitted Cade over London Bridge.       As the rebel passed   over the echoing drawbridge, he slashed in <num value="2">two</num> the ropes that supported it.   <num value="3">Three</num> days after the citizens, irritated at his robberies, barred up the bridge at night, and penned him close in his head-quarters at Southwark.   The rebels then flew to arms, and tried to force a passage, eventually winning the drawbridge, and burning many of the houses which stood in close rows near it. Now the battle raged by St. Magnus's corner, now at the bridge-foot, Southwark side, and all the while the Tower guns thundered at the swarming, maddened men of Kent. At <num value="9">nine</num> the next morning both sides, faint and weary, retired to their respective quarters. Soon afterwards Cade's army melted away; Cade, himself a fugitive, was slain in a Kentish garden where he had hid himself; and his grim, defaced head was placed on the very bridge-gate on which he had himself but recently, in scorn and triumph, placed the ghastly head of Lord Say, the murdered Treasurer of England. Round Cade's head, when the king re-entered London, were placed the heads of <num value="9">nine</num> of his captains. 
<P>At the entry of   Edward IV. into London, in <datestruct value="1461--"><year reg="1461">1461</year></datestruct>, before his coronation, he passed over London Bridge, escorted   by the mayor and his fellows, in scarlet, and <num value="400">400</num> commoners, <QUOTE>well horsed and clad in green.</QUOTE> 
<P>In <datestruct value="1471--"><year reg="1471">1471</year></datestruct>, when Henry was a prisoner in the Tower, the Bastard of Falconbridge, <num value="1">one</num> of the deposed king's piratical partisans, made a dash to plunder London.   While <num value="3000">3,000</num> of his men attacked Aldgate and Bishopsgate, the rest set fire to   London Bridge, and burnt <num value="13">thirteen</num> houses. But the citizens, led by Ralph Jocelyn, a brave Draper, made a gallant defence, drove off the filibusters, and chased them to Blackwall. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1481--"><year reg="1481">1481</year></datestruct> another house on the bridge fell down, drowning <num value="5">five</num> of its inhabitants. 
<P>The reign of Henry VII. brought more terrible trophies to London Bridge; for in <datestruct value="1496--"><year reg="1496">1496</year></datestruct> Flamock, a lawyer, and Joseph, a farrier of Bodmin, leaders of a great Cornish insurrection, contributed their heads to this decorative object. But Henry VII. was not half such a mower off of heads as that enormous Turk his son. Henry VIII., what with the wives he grew tired of, and what with the disbelievers in his ecclesiastical supremacy, kept theheadsman's axe very fairly busy. <num value="1">First</num> came the prior and several unfortunate Charter House monks, and then the good old Bishop of Rochester, John Fisher. The parboiled head of the good old man who would not bow the knee to Rimmon was kept, that Queen Anne Boleyn might enjoy the grateful sight.   The face for a fortnight remained so ruddy and life-like, and such crowds collected to see the so-called miracle, that the king, in a rage, at last ordered the head to be thrown down into the river. The next month came the head of a far greater and wiser man, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.14.1">Sir Thomas More</LEMMA>. This sacred relic More's daughter, Margaret Roper, bribed a man to remove, and drop into a boat in which she sat; and the head was long after buried with her, under a chapel adjoining St. Dunstan's, Canterbury. 
<P>In Queen Mary's reign there was again fighting on <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.15.1">London Bridge</LEMMA>.   In the year <datestruct value="1554"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct>, when rash Sir Thomas Wyatt led his <num value="4000">4,000</num> Kentish men to London, to stop the impending Spanish marriage, the rebel found the drawbridge cut away, the gates of London Bridge barred, and guns planted ready to receive him. Wyatt and his men dug a trench at the bridge-foot, and laid <num value="2">two</num> guns. The night before Wyatt retreated to Kingston, to cross the Thames there, <num value="7">seven</num> of his arquebusiers fired at a boat from the Tower, and killed a waterman on board. The next morning, the Lieutenant of the Tower turning <num value="7">seven</num> cannon on the steeples of St. Olave's and St. Mary Overie's, the people of Southwark begged Wyatt to withdraw, which he generously did. <pb id="P.15" n="15">

<P>In Elizabeth's reign the bridge was restored with great splendour. The City built a new gate and tower, <num value="3">three</num> storeys high, at the Southwark enda huge pile, full of square Tudor windows, with a covered way below. About the same time was also reared that wonder of London, Nonsuch House--a huge wooden pile, <num value="4">four</num> storeys high, with cupolas and turrets at each corner, brought from Holland, and erected with wooden pegs instead of nails. It stood over the <num value="7">seventh</num> and <num value="8">eighth</num> arches, on the north side of the drawbridge. There were carved wooden galleries outside the long lines of transom-casements, and the panels between were richly carved and gilt . In the same reign, Peter Moris, a Dutchman, established <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.15.8">water-works</LEMMA> at the north end of London Bridge; and, long before this, corn-mills had been erected at the south end of the same overtaxed structure. The <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.15.9">ghastly custom of displaying the heads of the victims of the scaffold</LEMMA>
 continued for many years after, both here and at the Tower. In the next reign, after the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, the head of Father Garnet (the account of whose execution in St. Paul's Churchyard we gave in a previous chapter) was added to the horrible collection on the bridge. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1632--"><year reg="1632">1632</year></datestruct> <num value="42">forty-two</num> houses on the north side of the bridge were destroyed by a fire, occasioned by a careless servant setting a tub of hot ashes under a staircase; and the Great Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct> laid low several houses on the same side of the bridge. 
<P>There are several old proverbs about London Bridge still extant.   <num value="2">Two</num> of these-- <QUOTE>If London Bridge had fewer eyes it would see better,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>London Bridge was made for wise men to go over and fools to go under</QUOTE> --point to the danger of the old passage past the starlings. 
<P>The old bridge had by the beginning of the eighteenth century become perilously ruinous. Pennant speaks of remembering the street as dark, narrow, and dangerous; the houses overhung the road in such a terrific manner as almost to shut out the daylight, and arches of timber crossed the street to keep the shaky old tenements from falling on each other.   Indeed, Providence alone kept together the long-toppling, dilapidated structure, that was perilous above and dangerous below. <QUOTE>Nothing but use,</QUOTE> says that agreeable and vivacious writer, Pennant, <QUOTE>could preserve the repose of the inmates, who soon grew deaf to the noise of the falling waters, the clamour of watermen, and the frequent shrieks of drowning wretches.</QUOTE> Though many booksellers and other tradesmen affected the great thoroughfare between Kent, Surrey, and Middlesex, the bridge houses were, in the reign of George II., chiefly tenanted by pin and needle makers; and economical ladies were accustomed to drive there from the west end of the town to make cheap purchases. 
<P>Although the roadway had been widened in the reigns of James II. and William, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.15.10">the double lines of rickety houses were not removed till <datestruct value="1757"><year reg="1757">1757</year></datestruct>-<num value="60">60</num></LEMMA>
 (George II.). During their removal <num value="3">three</num> pots of Elizabethan money were dug   up   among the ruins. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1758--"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>, a <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.15.11">temporary wooden bridge</LEMMA> built over the Thames while repairs of the old bridge were going on, was <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.15.12">destroyed by fire</LEMMA> was supposed by some footman in passing dropping his link among the woodwork.   Messrs. Taylor and Dance, the repairers, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.15.13">chopped the old bridge in <num value="2">two</num>, and built a new centre   arch</LEMMA>; but   the join became so insecure that   few   persons   would venture over it. The celebrated <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.15.14">Smeaton</LEMMA> was called in, in <datestruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>, and he advised the Corporation to buy back the stone of the old City gates, pulled down and sold the year before, to at once strengthen the shaky starlings. This was done, but proved a mere makeshift, and in <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct> the starlings again became loose, and an incessant wail of fresh complaints arose. The repairs were calculated at   <measure value="2500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2500">2,500</num></measure> yearly; and it was rather unfeelingly computed that <num value="50">fifty</num> watermen, barmen, or seamen, valued at <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure>, were annually drowned in passing the dangerous bridge. In <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, the City, in sheer desperation, resolved on a new bridge, <num value="100">100</num> feet westward of the old, and in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct> Mr. Rennie began the work by removing <num value="182">182</num> houses.   The earlier bridges had been eastward, and facing St.   Botolph's. During the excavations coins were discovered of Augustus, Vespasian, and later Roman emperors, besides many Nuremberg and tradesmen's tokens. There were also dredged up brass rings, buckles, iron keys, silver spoons, a gilt dagger, an iron spear-head, some carved stones, a bronze lamp, with a head of Bacchus, and a silver effigy of Harpocrates, the god of silence. This figure having attached to it a large gold ring, and a chain of pure gold, is supposed to have beep a priest's amulet, to be worn at religious ceremonies. The bridge cost   <measure value="506000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="506000">506,000</num></measure>. The <num value="1">first</num> stone was laid in <datestruct VALUE="1825-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, by the Right Honourable John Garratt, Lord Mayor, the Duke of York being present. 
<P>Among the celebrated persons who have resided on London Bridge there may be mentioned, among the most eminent, Hans Holbein, the great painter of Henry VIII.&lsquo;s court; Peter Monamy, the marine painter, apprenticed to a sign-painter on the bridge --he died in <datestruct value="1749--"><year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>; Jack Laguerre, the humorist, singer, player, and scene-painter, son of the Laguerre satirised by Pope; and Crispin Tucker, <pb id="P.16" n="16"> a waggish bookseller and author, who was intimate	 with Pope and Swift, and who lived under the	 southern gate, in a rickety bow-windowed shop,	 where Hogarth, when young, and engraving for old	 John Bowles, of the Black Horse, Cornhill, had once	 resided. This Bowles was the generous man who	 used to buy Hogarth's plates by weight, and who	 once offered an artist, who was going abroad on a when they-	 sketching tour, clean sheets of copper for all the   cried-	 engravings he chose to send over.	 
<P>The <num value="2">second</num> edition of that curious anecdotic old	 book, <title>Cocker's Dictionary,</title> the compilation of the	 celebrated penman and arithmetician, whose name	 has grown into a proverb, was <QUOTE>printed for T.

<P><num value="1">One</num> anecdote of the old bridge must	 not be   forgotten.  Mr. Baldwin, haber-	 dasher, living in the house over the	 chapel, was ordered,	when an old man of	 <num value="71">seventy-one</num>, to go to Chislehurst for	 change of air. But the invalid found he	 could not sleep in the country for want	 of the accustomed sound of the roar	 and rush of the tide under the old ruinous arches.

Within	 legal memory, says the <title>Morning Advertiser</title> of that	 date, <QUOTE>service has been performed there every	 Sabbath and saint's-day.</QUOTE> 	 
<P>The English Jews still have a very curious	 tradition which associates London Bridge with the	 story of the expulsion from England of their per-	 secuted forefathers in the reign of Edward I.	 Though few Jews have probably ever read Holin-	 shed, the legend is there to be found, and runs thus :-- <QUOTE>A sort of the richest of them,</QUOTE> says Holinshed, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>being shipped with their treasure in a mighty tall ship, which they had hired, when the same was under sail and got down the Thames, towards the mouth of the river, near Queenborough, the master-mariner bethought him of a wile, and caused his men to cast anchor, and so rode at the same, till the ship, by ebbing of the stream, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.016" n="2000.07.0008"><HEAD>Heads On Old London Bridge.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 remained on the dry sands. The master herewith enticed the Jews to walk out with him on land for recreation; and at length, when he understood the tide to be coming in, he got him back to the ship, whither he was drawn up by a cord. 
<P>The Jews made not so much   haste as he did, because they were not aware of the danger; but perceived how the matter stood, they to him for help; howbeit he told them that they ought to cry rather unto Moses, by whose conduct their fathers passed through the Red Sea, and therefore, if they would call to him for help, he was able enough to help them out of those raging floods, which now came in upon them. They cried, indeed, but no succour appeared, and so they were swallowed up in the water. The master returned with the ship, and told the king how he had used the matter, and had both thanks and reward,   as   some have written; but others affirm   (and more truly, as should seem) that divers of those mariners which dealt so   wickedly against the Jews, were   hanged   for their wicked practice, and so received a   just reward   of their fraudulent and mischievous      dealing.</QUOTE>
 
<P>That this story of Holinshed is true there seems little doubt, as the modern English Jews have preserved it by tradition, but with an altered locality. Mr. Margoliouth, an Anglo-Jewish writer, says:-- <QUOTE>The spot in the river Thames, where many of the poor exiles were drowned by the perfidy of a master mariner, is under the influence of ceaseless rage; and however calm and serene the river is elsewhere, that place is furiously boisterous. It is, moreover, affirmed that this relentless agitation is situated under London Bridge.	There are, even at the present day, some old-fashioned Hebrew families who implicitly credit the outrageous fury of the Thames. A small boat is now and then observed by a Hebrew observer, filled with young and old credulous Jews, steering towards the supposed spot, in order to see and hear the noisy sympathy of the waters. There are many traditions on the subject.</QUOTE>

<P>Among the great mansions and noblemen's palaces that once abounded in this narrow river-side street, we must <num value="1">first</num> of all touch at Cold Harbour, the residence of many great merchants and   princes of old time.   It is <num value="1">first</num> mentioned as Stow tells us in the <num value="13">13th</num> of Edward II., when Sir John. Abel, Knight, let it to   Henry Stow, a draper.   It was then called Cold Harbrough, in the parish of All Saints ad Foenum (All Hallows in the Hay), so named from an adjoining hay-wharf. Bequeathed to the Bigots, it was sold by them, in the reign of Edward III., to the well-known London merchant, Sir John Poultney, Draper,   <num value="4">four</num> times Mayor or London, and was then called Poultney's Inn. Sir John gave or let it to Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Essex for <num value="1">one</num> rose at Midsummer, to be given to him and his heirs for all services. In <datestruct value="1397--"><year reg="1397">1397</year></datestruct> Richard II. dined there, with his halfbrother John Holland, Earl of Huntingdon, who then lodged in Poultney's Inn, still accounted, as Stow says, <QUOTE>a right fair and stately house.</QUOTE> The next year, Edmund, Earl of Cambridge, lodged in it.   It still retained its old name in <datestruct value="1410--"><year reg="1410">1410</year></datestruct>, when Henry IV. granted the house to Prince Hal for the term of his life, starting the young reveller fairly by giving him a generous order on the collector of the customs for <num value="20">twenty</num> casks and <num value="1">one</num> pipe of red Gascony wine, free of duty.   In <datestruct value="1472--"><year reg="1472">1472</year></datestruct> the river-side mansion belonged to Henry Holland, Duke of Exeter. This duke was the unfortunate Lancastrian (great-grandson of John of Ghent) who, being severely wounded in the battle of Barnet was conveyed by <num value="1">one</num> of his faithful servants to the Sanctuary at Westminster. He remained in the custody of Edward IV., with the weekly dole of half a mark. The duke hoped to have obtained a pardon from the York party through the influence of his wife, Ann, who was the king's eldest sister.   But flight and   suffering had made both factions remorseless. This faithless wife obtaining a divorce, married Sir Thomas St. Leggier; and not long after, the duke's dead body was found floating in the sea between Dover and Calais.   He had either been murdered or drowned in trying to escape from England. Thus the Duke of Exeter's Inn suffered from victory of Edward, as his neighboor's, the great Earl of Worcester, had paid the penalties of Henry's temporary restoration in <datestruct value="1470--"><year reg="1470">1470</year></datestruct>. Richard III., grateful to the Heralds for standing up for his strong handed usurpation, gave Cold Harbour to the Heralds, who, however, were afterwards turned out by Cuthbert Tunstal, Bishop of Durham, whom   Henry VIII.   had forced out of Durham House in the Strand.   In the reign of Edward VI., just before the death of that boy of promise, the ambitious Earl of Northumberland, wishing to win the chief nobles to his side, gave Cold Harbour to Francis, the <num value="5">fifth</num> Earl of Shrewsbury, and its name was then changed to Shrewsbury House (<datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>), <num value="6">six</num> days before the young king's death. The next earl (guardian for <num value="15">fifteen</num> years of Mary Queen of Scots) took the house down, and built in its place a number of small tenements, and it then became the haunt of poverty, as we see by the following extracts from old writers:--

<P>On the east side of Dowgate, near the church of St. Mary Bothaw, formerly stood a celebrated old house frequently mentioned by Stow and the old chroniclers, and called, we know not why, the Erber.   Edward III. is known to have given it to <num value="1">one</num> of the Scropes. The last Scrope, in the reign of Henry IV., gave it to his brother, Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmoreland, who married Joan, daughter of the Duke of Lancaster. This earl was the son of John, Lord Neville of Raby, the knightly companion of Edward III., and who had shared with his chivalrous monarch the glory won in France.   From the earl it descended to the king-making Earl of Warwick, that great warrior, who looms like a giant through the red battle-fields of the Wars of the Roses, who lodged his father, the Earl of Salisbury, and <num value="500">500</num> men here in the congress of <datestruct value="1458--"><year reg="1458">1458</year></datestruct>, when there was a pretended reconciliation of the Houses of York and Lancaster, to be followed in <num value="2">two</num> years by the battle of Northampton and the deposition of the weak king. The great earl himself lived in Warwick Lane, Newgate Street . After the death of this maker and unmaker of kings, the house passed to the <QUOTE>false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,</QUOTE> who had fought on both sides, and, luckily for himself, at last on the victorious side.

 Clarence obtained, after the battle of Barnet, a grant of the house in right of his wife, Isabel, daughter of Warwick.   After Clarence's murder in the Tower, his younger brother, Richard of Gloucester--the Crookback and monster usurper of Shakespeare-occupied the Thames Street house, repaired it, and   called it <QUOTE>the King's Palace.</QUOTE> Ralph Darnel, a yeoman of the Crown, kept the building for King Richard till that hot day at Bosworth Field rendered such matters indifferent to him; and Henry VII. then gave it back to Edward, son of the Duke of Clarence, who kept it till his attainder in <datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct>.

The career of her daughters was also remarkable. Ann, her eldest daughter, married Henry Holland, Duke of Exeter, whose splendid fortunes and mysterious fate are so well known. Elizabeth, the <num value="2">second</num> daughter, became the wife of John de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, and lived to see her son, the <num value="2">second</num> duke, decapitated on Tower Hill for his attachment to the House of York.

<P>According to worthy Stow, the Vintry, up tillthe <num value="28">28th</num> of Edward I., was the special spot where the   Bordeaux merchants unloaded their lighters and sold their wines.   Sir John Stodie, Vintner, gave the ground, in <datestruct value="1357--"><year reg="1357">1357</year></datestruct> (Edward III.), to the Vintners, with all the neighbouring tenements, and there the Vintners built a fair hall, and <num value="13">thirteen</num> almshouses for <num value="13">thirteen</num> poor people. 
<P>The contentions between the citizens of London and the Gascon wine merchants, in the reign of Edward I. it has been remarked, would lead us to infer that the Vintners had long before that time acted as a fraternity, though not formally incorporated till the reign of Henry VI. Edward I. granted   them Botolph Wharf, near Billingsgate, in the mayoralty of Henry de Valois, on their paying a silver penny annually at the feast of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist. Towards the French wars they contributed     <measure value="23l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="23">23</num></measure>   <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure>, a greater sum than that given by the majority of the companies; and in <num value="50">50</num> Edward III. they sent <num value="6">six</num> members to the Common Council, which showed their wealth and importance. 
<P>The Saxons seem to have had vineyards.   In the Norman times there was a vineyard in the Tower precincts   It is supposed this uncomfortable home-made wine was discarded when Gascony fell into our hands.   Some writers who disbelieve in English wines declare that the Saxons used the English word <QUOTE>vineyard</QUOTE> for <QUOTE>orchard,</QUOTE> and that wine was, after all, cider. Certain, however, it is that at Bath and other old towns there are old streets still called the Vineyard. The traffic in Bordeaux wines is said to have commenced about <datestruct value="1154--"><year reg="1154">1154</year></datestruct>, when Henry II. married Eleanor of Aquitaine. 
<P> <QUOTE>The Normans,</QUOTE> says Herbert, <QUOTE>were the great carriers, and Guienne the place from whence most of our wines came.</QUOTE> The wines enumerated are Muscadell, a rich wine; Malmsey, Rhenish; Dale wine, a sort of Rhenish; Stum, strong new wine; Gascony wine; Alicant, a Spanish wine, made of mulberries; Canary wine, or sweet sack (the grape of which was brought from the Canaries); Sherry, <pb id="P.22" n="22"> the original sack, not sweet; Rumney, a sort of Spanish wine. Sack was a term loosely applied at <num value="1">first</num> to all white wines.   It was probably those species of wines that Fitzstephens, in the reign of Henry II., mentions to have been sold in the ships, and in wine-cellars near the public places of cookery on the Thames' bank. 
<P>There were <num value="4">four</num> Vintner mayors in the reign of Edward III.; and yet, says Stow, gravely, <QUOTE>Gascoyne wines were then sold at London not above <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>d.</measure>, nor Rhenish wine above <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> the gallon.</QUOTE> In this reign John Peeche, a fishmonger, was imprisoned and fined for having obtained a monopoly for the sale of sweet wines; and in the <num value="6">6th</num> of Henry VI., John Rainewell, Mayor of London, finding that the Lombard wine merchants adulterated their sweet wines, he, in his wrath, ordered <num value="150">150</num> vessels to be staved in, <QUOTE>so that the liquor, running forth, passed through the cittie like a stream of rainwater in the sight of all the people, from whence there issued a most loathsome savour.</QUOTE> 
<P>In <num value="2">2</num> Henry VI. there was a petition to Parliament praying that the wine-casks from Gasconytonnes, pipes and hogsheads--should be of full and true measure; and in <num value="10">10</num> Henry VI. there was another petition against the adulteration of Gascon and Guienne wines, in which the writer says, <QUOTE>wines that formerly had been fine and fair were drinking for <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> lives.</QUOTE> 
<P>The charter confirmed by Henry VI. forbids any but such as are enfranchised by the craft of Vintners to trade in wines from   Gascony; and Gascoigners were forbidden to sell wine except in the tun or pipe. The right of search in taverns and the regulation of prices was given to <num value="4">four</num> members of the Company, annually chosen. It also permitted merchant Vintners to buy cloth, and the merchants of Gascoigne to purchase dried fish in Cornwall and Devon, also herrings and cloth, in what other parts of the kingdom they please.   All wines coming to London were to be unloaded above London Bridge, at the Vintry, so that the king's bottlers and gaugers might there take custom. 
<P>Charles I., always arbitrary and greedy, seems to have extorted <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">40</num>s.</measure> a tun from the Vintners, and in return prohibited the wine coopers from exporting wines. Licences for retailing wine were at this time granted by the Vintners' Company for the king's benefit. He also forbade the sale of wines in bottles instead of measures. 
<P>The Vintners have <num value="6">six</num> charters-Edward III., Henry VI. (<num value="2">two</num>), Mary, Elizabeth, and their acting charter, <num value="9">9</num> James I. The Vintners' arms, granted by Henry VI., are sable, a chevron cetu, <num value="3">three</num> tuns argent, with a Bacchus and loving-cup for the crest. 
<P>Patents received their death-blow from the Parliament in <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, when <num value="2">two</num> patentees, Alderman Abell and Richard   Kilvert, were severely fined for having obtained from   Charles I. an exclusive patent for wine.

<P>A   very scarce and satirical contemporaneous tract on the subject (says Herbert) gives, in a supposed dialogue between the <num value="2">two</num> parties, a ludicrous exposure of this business of patent hunting.

 At <num value="1">one</num> period, however, the Vintners' Company alone possessed <num value="500">500</num> birds. 
<P>On the <num value="1">first</num> Monday in August in every year, the swan-markers of the Crown and the <num value="2">two</num> City companies go up the Thames for the purpose of 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.23.3">inspecting and taking an account of the swans</LEMMA>
 belonging to their respective   employers, and marking  the young birds.   They proceed to the different parts of the river frequented by the swans for breeding, and other places where these birds are kept. They pay half-a-crown for each young bird to the fishermen who have   made nests for the old birds, and <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> per week to any person who during the winter has taken care of <hi rend=italics>the</hi> swans by sheltering them in ponds, or otherwise protecting them from the severity of the weather.   When, as it sometimes   happens,   the cob   bird (male) of <num value="1">one</num> owner mates with a   pen bird (female) belonging to another, the brood are divided between the owners of the parent birds, the odd cygnet (except in Buckinghamshire) being allotted to the owner of the cob. 
<P>The <hi rend=italics>marks</hi> are made upon the upper mandible with a knife or other sharp instrument. The forms and devices greatly differ.   Thus, the swan-mark of Eton College, which has the privilege of keeping swans on the Thames, is the armed point and feathered end of an arrow, and is represented by nail-heads on the door of <num value="1">one</num> of the inner rooms of the college.   The Dyers' and Vintners' marks date from the reign of Elizabeth, and anciently consisted of circles or amulets on the beak; but the cutting of these being considered to inflict more severe pain on the birds than straight lines, the rings are now omitted, and the lines are doubled. The <num value="2">two</num> nicks are probably intended for <num value="2">two</num> half-lozenges, or a demi-lozengsee on each side. The V is perhaps a chevron reversed, the arms of the Company being sable, a chevron between <num value="3">three</num> tuns argent; for the true chevron could scarcely be cut on the beak of the bird without each lateral branch crossing its elongated and tender nostril; and this, from a <pb id="P.24" n="24"> feeling of humanity, the marker would be disposed to avoid. That many of these swan-marks, besides being heraldic, have the adaptation of the initial letter of the word  <Q>Vintner,</Q>  and form also the Roman numeral V, is supported by a custom at the feasts of the Vintners' Company, where <num value="1">one</num> of the regular stand--up toasts of the day is,  <Q>The Worshipful Company of Vintners with <num value="5">Five</num>.</Q>    The royal swan-mark has been unchanged since the commencement of the reign of George III.</QUOTE>
 
<P>On College Hill, while intriguing with the City, lived Dryden's <title>Zimri,</title> the <num value="2">second</num> Duke of Buckingham.   In a pasquinade, preserved in the State Poems, entitled the <title>D. of B&lsquo;s. (Duke of Buckingham's) Litany,</title> occur the following lines :

<P>Lord Clarendon, in his life of himself, indeed, informs us that <QUOTE>the duke had many lodgings in several quarters of the City; and though his Majesty had frequent intelligence where he was, yet when the serjeant-at-arms, and others, employed for his apprehension, came where he was known to have <pb id="P.25" n="25"> been but an hour before, he was gone from hence, or so concealed that he could not be found.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>Dryden's inimitable description,</QUOTE> says Sir Walter Scott, who has himself nobly sketched the <title>Zimri</title>
 of the poet, <QUOTE>refers, as is well known, to the famous George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, son of the favourite of Charles I., who was murdered by Felton. The Restoration put into the hands of the most lively, mercurial, ambitious, and licentious genius who ever lived, an estate of <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> a year, to be squandered in every wild scheme which the lust of power, of pleasure, of licence, or of whim, could dictate to an unrestrained imagination. Being refused the situation of president of the North, he was suspected of having favoured the disaffected in that part of England, and was disgraced accordingly. But in i<num value="666">666</num> he regained the favour of the king, and became a member of the 
<FIGURE id="Fig.025" n="2000.07.0012"><HEAD>Tower Street Ward. (From A Map Made For Stow's Survey.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 famous administration called the Cabal, which <num value="1">first</num> led. Charles into unpopular and arbitrary measures, and laid the foundation for the troubles of his future reign. Buckingham   changed sides about <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, and becoming attached to the country party, made a most active figure in all proceedings which had relation to the Popish plot; intrigued deeply with Shaftesbury, and distinguished himself as a promoter of the Bill of Exclusion. Hence he stood an eminent mark for Dryden's satire, which, we. may believe, was not the less poignant that the poet had sustained a personal affront, from being depicted by his grace under the character of Bayes in the <title>Rehearsal</title>.   As Dryden owed the duke no favour, he has shown him none; yet, even here, the ridiculous rather than the infamous part of his character is touched upon;. and the unprincipled libertine, who slew the Earl of Shrewsbury while <pb id="P.26" n="26"> his adulterous countess held his horse in the disguise of a page, and who boasted of caressing her before he changed the bloody clothes in which he had murdered her husband, is not exposed to hatred, while the spendthrift and castle-builder are held up to contempt.</QUOTE>

<L>That life of pleasure, and that soul of whim;

<L>No fool to laugh at, which he valued more; 
<L>There, victor of his health, of fortune, friends,

<P>It must, however, be allowed that the poet's shadows are too dark, for the duke died in the house of a respectable tenant in Yorkshire, from a fever caught out hunting. 
<P>The Mercers' School, College Hill, is <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="4">four</num> ancient schools of London, of which number the Mercers' Company have the proud privilege of having given their generous patronage to <num value="2">two</num>. It stood originally in the Old Jewry (west side), and formed part of a cemetery for strangers and a house of the Knights Hospitalers, founded during the reign of Henry II. by Thomas Fitz- Theobald de Helles, who married Agnes, a sister of the so-called martyr Thomas b Becket. The school was held in a chapel of St. Thomas of Acon (Acre). It was classed among the <num value="4">four</num> City schools which received the sanction of Parliament in <datestruct value="1447--"><year reg="1447">1447</year></datestruct> (Henry VI.), when <QUOTE><num value="4">four</num> grave clergymen and parsons</QUOTE> of City parishes, seeing the gross ignorance prevalent in London since Henry V. had seized many of the alien priories and religious houses in England, and so reduced the number of schools, humbly petitioned that they might be allowed to play a part in. the advancement of learning. These worthy men were at once allowed to set up schools of their own founding in their respective parishes--i.e.., Great Allhallows, St. Andrew's, Holborn, St. Peter's, Cornhill, and St. Mary Colechurch (St. Thomas Acons).   When   Henry VIII. laid his eager hands on the Abbot of St. Nicholas' princely revenues, and sold the hospital to the Mercers' Company, he expressly stipulated that the school, chapel, and cemetery should be retained.   After the: Great Fire, in the Act for rebuilding the City (<datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>), it was expressly provided that there should be a plot of ground set apart on the west side of Old Jewry for Mercers' Chapel Grammar School. In <datestruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></datestruct> the school was removed to No. <num value="13">13</num>, Budge Row, about <num value="30">thirty</num> yards from Dowgate Hill. On the death of Mr. Waterhouse, the master, in <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct>, the school was suspended for a time, and then removed to No. <num value="20">20</num>, Red Lion Court, Watling Street. There it remained till <datestruct value="1808"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>, when it was removed to its present situation on College Hill. Up to <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct> it had been a free school with <num value="25">twenty-five</num> scholars, the master being allowed to take private pupils. Greek and Latin were alone taught; but after <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct> English and the modem sciences were also introduced.   The school reopened with a single scholar, but soon began to take root; and in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct> the Company increased the number of scholars to <num value="35">thirty-five</num>. There are <num value="2">two</num> exhibitions of <measure value="70l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="70">70</num></measure> each, founded by Mr. Thomas Rich, a master of the school, who died in <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>. The rules of <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct> require every boy to bring wax tapers for his use in winter. Mr. William Baxter, an eminent grammarian, who died in the year <datestruct value="1725"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>, was master of this school for more than <num value="20">twenty</num> years. 
<P>The list of eminent persons educated in the Mercers' School includes the wise and worthy Dean Colet, the friend of Erasmus and founder of St. Paul's School; that great merchant, Sir Thomas Gresham; William Fulke, master of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, and a commentator on the Rheims Testament; John Young, Bishop of Rochester (died <datestruct value="1605--"><year reg="1605">1605</year></datestruct>); Davenant, Bishop   of Salisbury (died <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>); Sir Lionel Cranfield, afterwards Earl of Middlesex and Lord Treasurer to James I.; and Matthew Wren, Bishop of Ely (died <datestruct value="1667--"><year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>). 
<P>St. Michael's Paternoster Royal, College Hill, is mentioned as early as <datestruct value="1283"><year reg="1283">1283</year></datestruct>, when Hugh de Derby was rector.   It is interesting to us from having been rebuilt by the illustrious Richard Whittington, thrice Lord Mayor of London. Here, on the north side of the church, he built <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.27.1">almshouses</LEMMA>(now the site of the Mercers' School), some years since removed to Highgate; and here, in great state, he was buried. Alas for human fame and human gratitude   no memorial of the good man now exists at St. Michael's--not even a half-worn-out stone--not even a thin, trodden, defaced brass. The great sculptured marble tomb is gone to dust; the banners have faded like the leaf. In the reign of Edward VI. <num value="1">one</num> Mountain, an incumbent (may the earth lie heavy on him!), believing great riches of gold and jewels were buried with Whittington, dug him up, and, probably in his vexation, destroyed <pb id="P.27" n="27"> the tomb.   In the reign of Mary the parishioners reopened the grave, to re-wrap the dishonoured body in lead.   It is now beyond- desecration, nor could it be sifted from the obscurer earth. In the old epitaph, which is in excellent rhyming Latin, Whittington is quaintly termed <QUOTE lang=la>Richardus Albificans villam.</QUOTE>

<P>St. Michael's was destroyed in the Great Fire, and rebuilt under Wren's directions.   The spire was erected in <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct>.   The parish of St. Martin Vintry is incorporated with that of St. Michael. In this church is Hilton's commendable picture of St. Mary Magdalene anointing the feet of Christ, presented by the directors of the British Institution in <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>.   There is some good carving in the oak altar-piece below the picture.   The marble font was the gift of Abraham   Jordan in <datestruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct>.   The monument to Sir Samuel Pennant (an ancestor of the London historian), who died in the year of his mayoralty (<datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>), is worthy of record, as is that of Marmaduke Langdale, a descendant of that Lord Langdale who commanded the left wing of King Charles's army in the battle of Naseby. The lower storey of the steeple is formed by <num value="8">eight</num> projecting Ionic columns, bearing an entablature and vases, and the effect, though fantastic, is not unpicturesque. 
<P>In St. Michael's lies buried that brave young Cavalier poet, John Cleveland, as clever and as unfortunate a bard as his contemporary, poor Lovelace.   Expelled from a Cambridge fellowship as a malignant, Cleveland mounted his horse and drew sword for King Charles, for whom   he wrote or fought till his life's end. He was thrown into prison by Cromwell, who let him out on his telling him that he was too poor to purchase his release. The poet then took up his' abode in Gray's Inn, close to Butler, the author of <title>Hudibras,</title> and there they established a nightly Cavalier club. Cleveland died young, and his friend, good Bishop Pearson, preached his funeral sermon.   Of the poet's quick, overstrained fancy, and of his bitter satire against. the Scotch, who had betrayed King Charles for money, we give <num value="2">two</num> examples:--

The <num value="1">first</num> intention of the Merchant Taylors' Company to found a grammar school, <QUOTE>for the better education and bringing; up of children in good manners and literature,</QUOTE> says Mr. Staunton, was manifested in the spring of <datestruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct>.- About this period, a leading member of the fraternity, Mr. Richard Hills, generously offered the sum of <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> (equivalent to about <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure> at the present day) towards the purchase of a part of the <QUOTE>Manor of the Rose,</QUOTE> in the parish of St. Laurence Poulteney. The <QUOTE>Rose</QUOTE> was a spacious mansion, originally built by Sir John Pulteney, Knight, <num value="5">five</num> times Lord Mayor of London, in the reign of Edward III. Its fortunes had been various.   After passing through the hands of several noble families-the Hollands, De la Poles, Staffords, and Courtenaystheir tenancies in too many--instances terminating by the tragical process of attainder, it was granted to the Ratcliffe or Sussex family, who obtained leave to part with it in a more business-like manner. Shakespeare has rendered the <QUOTE>Manor of the Rose,</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>Pulteney's Inn,</QUOTE> as it was sometimes called, a memorable spot to all time by his allusion to it in <title>King Henry   VIII</title>.   In the <num value="1">first</num> act of that play, it will be remembered, Buckingham's surveyor appears before the court to impeach his master, and tells the king- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Not long before your Highness sped to France, 
<L>The Duke, being at the Rose, within the parish 
<L>St. Laurence Poulteney, did of me demand

<L>Concerning the French journey.</QUOTE>
 
<P>The name of the street, Suffolk Lane, from which it is entered, and of the parish, St. Laurence Poultney, or Pountney, in which it is situated, still recalls its former occupants.   Ducksfoot Lane, in the vicinity, was the <hi rend=italics>Duke's Foot-lane</hi>, or private pathway from his garden, which lay to the east of the mansion, towards the river; while the upper part of St. Laurence Pounteney Hill was, until the last few years, called <QUOTE>Green Lettuce Lane,</QUOTE> a corruption of <hi rend=italics>Green-Lattice Lane</hi>, so named from the lattice gate which opened into what is now named Cannon Street. <pb id="P.29" n="29"> 
<P>The Merchant Taylors' Company purchased, for a school, in <datestruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct>, part of Sussex House, including a gate-house, a long court, a winding stair leading to the leads over the chapel, <num value="2">two</num> galleries at the south end of the court, and part of the chapel. The remainder of the mansion, and the site of the garden, which lay to the east of it, were acquired by the Company about <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, for <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure>, in order to enlarge the school. In <datestruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct> they expended the sum of <measure value="90000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="90000">90,000</num></measure> in purchasing a large portion of the Charterhouse, and thither the school will be moved.   By the original statutes of <datestruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct> it was ordained that the high master should be <QUOTE>a man in body whole, sober, discrete, honest, vertuous, and learned in good and cleane Latin literature, and also in Greeke, yf such may be gotten.</QUOTE> He might be either wedded or single, or a priest that had no benefice. He must have <num value="3">three</num> ushers. The number of scholars was limited to <num value="250">250</num>, <QUOTE>of all nations and countries indifferently.</QUOTE> The children of Jews were afterwards ungenerously excluded.   There was, lastly, to be every year an examination of the scholars . 
<P>The <num value="1">first</num> head master was that famed old pedagogue, Richard Mulcaster, who wielded the ferule, and pretty sharply too, for many years.   He was a Cumberland man, brought up at Eton, and renowned for his critical knowledge of Greek, Latin, and Oriental literature.   A veritable old Tartar he seems to have been, according to Fuller, who says of him, that he was a severe disciplinarian, but beloved by his pupils when they came to the age of maturity, and reflected on the benefit they had derived from his care. 
<P>Mulcaster   as great at Latin plays, and they were often acted at Hampton Court and elsewhere, before Queen Elizabeth. Many of his boys who went to St. John's, Oxford, became renowned as actors in Latin plays before Elizabeth and James. Mulcaster also wrote mythological verses, which were recited before long-suffering Queen Bess, and <num value="2">two</num> educational treatises, dry but sound. The worthy old pedant had frequent quarrels with the Merchant Taylors, and eventually left them in <datestruct value="1586--"><year reg="1586">1586</year></datestruct>, and became upper master of St. Paul's School. To the Company, who would have detained him, he replied scornfully, <QUOTE lang=la>Fidelis servus est perpetuus asinus.</QUOTE>   He boldly resisted an attempt to tax teachers in <datestruct value="1581--"><year reg="1581">1581</year></datestruct>-<num value="2">2</num>, was successful in preserving the immunities of the school granted after the Reformation, and died in <datestruct value="1610--"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct>. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1566--"><year reg="1566">1566</year></datestruct> the school made a tremendous stride. Sir Thomas White, a princely Merchant Taylor, founded St. John's College, Oxford, and munificently appropriated no less than <num value="43">forty-three</num> fellowships in the college to the scholars of Merchant Taylors' School. Much quarrelling eventually took place between the Company and the President and Fellows of St. John's, who delayed, for inadequate reasons, the election of scholars, and declared that their funds were inadequate to support the expenses of coming to London every year to the St. Barnabas' Day examinations. 
<P>The school soon rising to eminence, several rich and benevolent citizens gave exhibitions to poor and struggling scholars, a very noble way of spending money. The most eminent of these were Walter Ffysshe, John Vernon, and Thomas Wheatenhole. The school was destroyed in the Great Fire, when only the books in the library were preserved; and <num value="10">ten</num> years elapsed before the new building was completed.   The new school, erected in <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, consisted of a long school-room, supported on the east side by a number of stone pillars, forming a cloister (the only play-ground). The library was formerly the ducal chapel. 
<P>The list of eminent men educated at the Merchant Taylors' is a proud <num value="1">one</num>. It boasts of William Juxon, Bishop of London, and, after the Restoration, Archbishop of Canterbury, who faithfully attended Charles I. on the scaffold; William Dawes and John Gilbert, Archbishops of York; and Hugh Boulter, Archbishop of Armagh. 
<P>Among these bishops was that eminent scholar and divine, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.29.1">Bishop Andrewes</LEMMA>, before whom even James I. dared not indulge in ribaldry.   He defended King James's <QUOTE>Defence of the Rights of Kings</QUOTE> against Cardinal Bellarmine, and in return obtained the see of Ely. 
<P>There is a pleasant story told of Andrewes while he was Bishop of Winchester. Waller the poet, going to see the king at dinner, overheard an extraordinary conversation between his Majesty and <num value="2">two</num> prelates, Andrewes and Neale (Bishop of Durham), who were standing behind the royal chair. <QUOTE>My lords,</QUOTE> asked the king, <QUOTE>cannot I take my subjects' money when I want it without all this formality in Parliament?</QUOTE> The Bishop of Durham   readily answered, <QUOTE>God forbid, sir, but you should: you are the breath of our nostrils.</QUOTE> Whereupon the king turned and said to the Bishop of Winchester, <QUOTE>Well, my lord, what say you?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Sir,</QUOTE> replied he, <QUOTE>I have no skill to judge of parliamentary cases.</QUOTE> The king quickly rejoined, <QUOTE>No put-offs, my lord; answer me at once.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Then, sir,</QUOTE> said he, <QUOTE>I think it quite lawful for you to take my brother Neale's money, for he offers it.</QUOTE> Waller reports that the company were well pleased with the answer, and the wit of it seemed to affect the king. <pb id="P.30" n="30"> 
<P>The list of Merchant Taylor bishops also includes Thomas Dove, Bishop of Peterborough, chaplain to Queen Elizabeth, who, from his flowing white locks, called him the <QUOTE>Dove with silver wings ;</QUOTE> Matthew Wren, Bishop of Ely, Sir Christopher's uncle, who accompanied Prince Charles to Spain, and was imprisoned in the Tower eighteen years, refusing to come out on Cromwell's offer; John Buckridge, also Bishop of Ely; Giles Thompson, Bishop of Gloucester; and Peter Mews, Bishop of Winchester, who, expelled Oxford by the Puritans, entered the army, and served under the Duke of York in Flanders. 
<P>Of the other professions, Sir James Whitelocke, Justice of the Common Pleas and of the King's Bench; Bulstrode Whitelocke, his son, the author of the <QUOTE>Memorials of English Affairs, from the Beginning of the Reign of Charles II. to the Restoration,</QUOTE> were Merchant Taylors' scholars. Whitelocke, the son, a but half-and-half Cromwellian, began life by supporting Hampden in his resistance to ship-money, and afterwards served Cromwell with more or less fidelity.   At the Restoration Charles II. dismissed him to go into the country, and <QUOTE>take care of his wife and <num value="1">one</num>-

<P>St. James's, Garlick Hythe, was rebuilt by Richard Rothing, Sheriff, in <datestruct value="1326--"><year reg="1326">1326</year></datestruct>.   Weever, that <QUOTE>Old Mortality</QUOTE> of his times, gives the epitaph of Richard Lions, a wine merchant and lapidary, who was beheaded by Wat Tyler's men, and buried here. According to Grafton the chronicler, Wat Tyler had been once servant to this merchant, who had beaten him, and this was the Kentish rebel's revenge. Stow says of this monument of Richard II.'s time-- <QUOTE>Richard   Lions, a famous merchant of wines and a lapidary, some time <num value="1">one</num> of the sheriffs, beheaded in Cheap by Wat Tyler and other rebels, in the year <datestruct value="1381"><year reg="1381">1381</year></datestruct>: his picture on his grave-stone, very fair and large, is with his hair rounded by his ears and curled, a little beard forked; a gown, girt to him   down to his feet, of branched damask, wrought with the likeness of flowers; a large purse on his right side, hanging in a belt from his left shoulder; a plain hood about his neck, covering his shoulders, and hanging back behind him.</QUOTE> 
<P>Destroyed in the Great Fire, this church was rebuilt by Wren at an expense of <hi rend=italics><measure value="5357l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5357">5,357</num></measure> <num value="12">12</num>s</hi>. <measure value="10d." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>d.</measure> The coarse altar-piece of the Ascension was painted by A. Geddes, and given to the church in <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct> by the rector, the Rev. T. Burnet, brother of the eminent engraver. The organ was built by the celebrated Father Smith in <datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>. On the dial, which projects from the face of the church, is a carved figure of St. James. In a vault beneath the church lies the corpse of a man in a singular state of preservation. <num value="4">Four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> mediaeval lord mayors are buried in this church. 
<P>In the <title>Spectator</title> (No. <num value="147">147</num>) there is an interesting notice of St. James's, Garlick Hythe.   <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.32.2">Steele</LEMMA>, speaking of the beautiful service of the Church of England, remarks- <QUOTE>Until Sunday was se'nnight, I never discovered, to so great a degree, the excellency of the Common Prayer. Being at St. James's Church, Garlick Hill, I heard the service read so distinctly, so emphatically, and so fervently, that, it was next to an impossibility to be inattentive. My eyes and my thoughts could not wander as usual, but were confined to my prayers. <gap>    The Confession was read with such a resigned humility the Absolution with such a comfortable authority, the Thanksgiving with such a religious joy, as made me feel those affections of the mind in a manner I never did before.</QUOTE> The rector of the parish at this period was the Rev. Philip Stubbs, afterwards Archdeacon of St. Albans, whose fine voice and impressive delivery are said to have been long remembered by his old parishioners. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.32.3">The Steel Yard</LEMMA> on the river-side, near Cousin Lane   (now Iron Wharf), was the old residence of the Hanse Town, German, and Flemish merchants, who obtained a settlement in London as early as <datestruct value="1250"><year reg="1250">1250</year></datestruct>. Henry III., in <datestruct value="1259--"><year reg="1259">1259</year></datestruct>, at the request of his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall and King of the Romans, granted them   very valuable privileges, renewed and confirmed by Edward I. The City also conceded them many privileges, on condition of their maintaining Bishopsgate in repair (they rebuilt it once), and sustaining a <num value="3">third</num> of the charges in money and men to defend it when need was. In spite of English jealousy, the Steel Yard merchants flourished till the reign of Edward VI., when the Merchant Adventurers complained of them, and they were held, like all <QUOTE>other strangers,</QUOTE> to have forfeited their liberties.   In vain Hamburg and Lubeck sent ambassadors to intercede for their countrymen. Their monopoly was gone, but the Steel Yard men still throve, and continued to export English cloth.   Elizabeth, however, was rougher with them, and finally expelled them the country in <datestruct value="1597--"><year reg="1597">1597</year></datestruct>-<num value="8">8</num>. 
<P> <QUOTE>Their hall,</QUOTE> says Stow, <QUOTE>is large, built of stone, with <num value="3">three</num> arched gates towards the street, the middlemost whereof is far bigger than the others, and is seldom opened; the other <num value="2">two</num> be secured up. The same is now called the old hall. The merchants of Almaine used to bring hither as well wheat, rye, and other grain, as cables, ropes, masts, pitch, tar, flax, hemp, linen cloth, wainscots, wax, steel, and other profitable merchandise.</QUOTE> In the Privy Council Register of the year <datestruct value="1597"><year reg="1597">1597</year></datestruct>-<num value="8">8</num>, Mr. Peter Cunningham   discovered an entry appointing the Steel Yard as a house <QUOTE>for the better bestowing and safe custody of divers provisions of the navy (naval stores).</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>In the hall of this Company,</QUOTE> says Pennant, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>were the <num value="2">two</num> famous pictures, painted in distemper by <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.33.1">Holbein</LEMMA>, representing the triumphs of Riches and Poverty. They were lost, being supposed to have been carried into Flanders, on the destruction of the Company, and from thence into France. I am to learn where they are at present, unless in the cabinet of M. Fleischman, at Hesse- Darmstadt. The celebrated Christian a Mechel, of Basil, has lately published <num value="2">two</num> engravings of these <pb id="P.33" n="33"> pictures, either from the originals, or the drawings of Zucchero, for  <Q>Frid. Zucchero, <datestruct value="1574--"><year reg="1574">1574</year></datestruct>,</Q>  is at <num value="1">one</num> corner of each print.   Drawings of these pictures were found in England by Vertue, ascribed to Holbein, and the verses over them to Sir Thomas More.   It appears that Zucchero copied them at the Steel Yard, so probably these copies, in process of time, might have fallen into the hands of M. Fleischman. 
<P>In the triumph of Riches, Plutus is represented in a golden car, and Fortune sitting before him, flinging money into the laps of people holding up their garments to receive her favours.   Ventidius is wrote under <num value="1">one</num>, Gadareus under another, and Themistocles under a man kneeling beside the car; Croesus, Midas, and Tantalus follow; Narcissus holds the horse of the <num value="1">first</num>; over their heads, in the clouds, is Nemesis. There are various allegorical figures I shall not attempt to explain. By the side of the horses walk dropsical and other diseased figures, the too frequent accompaniment of riches. 
<P>Poverty appears in another car, mean and shattered, half naked, squalid, and meagre.   Behind her sits Misfortune; before her, Memory, Experience, Industry, and Hope. The car is drawn by a pair of oxen and a pair of asses; Diligence drives the ass, and Solicitude, with a face of care, goads the ox. By the sides of the car walks Labour, represented by lusty workmen with their tools, with cheerful looks; and behind them, Misery and Beggary, in ragged weeds, and with countenances replete with wretchedness and discontent.</QUOTE>
 
<P>According to Mr. Wornum   (a most competent authority), in his excellent <title>Life of Holbein,</title> these <num value="2">two</num> pictures were presented, in <datestruct value="1617--"><year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct>, by the representatives of the Steel Yard merchants to Henry Prince of Wales, a well-known lover of art.   They afterwards passed into the possession of Charles I. and are said to have perished in the fire at White hall, <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>. Felibien, however, in <datestruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>, describes having seen them   in Paris; and it is more probable they were among the art-treasures sold and dispersed in Cromwell's time. Sandrart mentions having seen the pictures, or drawings of them, in the Long Gallery at Arundel House. Zucchero copied them   in <datestruct value="1574--"><year reg="1574">1574</year></datestruct>, and Vosterman Junior engraved them. Vertue describes drawings of them at Buckingham House in black and white chalk, with coloured skies, which he supposes to be Vosterman's copies.   Horace Walpole, however, who purchased them, considered <num value="1">one</num> drawing only to be Vosterman's, and the other to be Zucchero's. The British Museum possesses copies of these pictures by Bischop, a Dutch artist, and a sketch of the <QUOTE>Riches,</QUOTE> done by Holbein himself, drawn with the pen and washed with Indian ink. On the <QUOTE>Riches</QUOTE> of Bischop are written <num value="2">two</num> lines on the penalties of wealth, attributed to Sir Thomas More- 
<QUOTE lang=la REND=blockquote><L>Aurum blanditiae pater est natusque doloris, 
<L>Qui caret hoc moeret, qui tenet hoc mutest.</QUOTE>
 These lines were originally inscribed over the entrance of the Steel Yard. 
<P>On a tablet suspended to a tree, in the picture representing <QUOTE>Poverty,</QUOTE> is a Latin line, also atriabutted to More, as the reward of poverty- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote>Qui pauper est, Nihau timeout, Nihau Potts prodder.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Holbein, on his return to London from Basal, in <datestruct value="1531--"><year reg="1531">1531</year></datestruct>, seems to have painted many portraits of his fellow-countrymen in the Steel Yard. Mr. Wornum especially mentions a nameless member of the Stahlhof in the Windsor collection. It represents a young man with a brown beard, clad in a black cap and furred surtout, who, seated at a table, is about to open a letter by cutting the string that fastens it with a knife. The letter is inscribed <QUOTE>Stahlhof.</QUOTE> But the most celebrated picture of this class is the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.33.2"> <QUOTE>George Gyze,</QUOTE> </LEMMA> in the Berlin gallery.   He is also about to open a letter inscribed <QUOTE>To the Honourable George Gyze, in London, in England, my brother, to be delivered into his hands.</QUOTE> <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.33.3">Mr. Ruskin</LEMMA> has adorned this picture with the rich enamel of his well-chosen words. <QUOTE>Every accessory,</QUOTE> he says <QUOTE><p>in the portrait of the Kauffmann George Gyzen is perfect with a fine perfection; the carnations in the glass vase by his side; the ball of gold, chased with blue enamel, suspended on the wall; the books, the steelyard, the papers on the table, the seal-ring, with its quartered bearings, all intensely there, and there in beauty of which no <num value="1">one</num> could have dreamed that even flowers or gold were capable, far less parchment or steel.   But every change of shade is felt, every rich and rubied line of petal followed, every subdued gleam in the soft blue of the enamel, and bending of the gold, touched with a hand whose patience of regard creates rather than paints. The jewel itself was not so precious as the rays of enduring light which. form it, beneath that errorless hand. The man himself, what he was--not more; but to all conceivable proof of sight--in all aspect of life or thought--not less.   He sits alone in his accustomed room, his common work laid out before him; he is conscious of no presence, assumes no dignity, bears no sudden or superficial look of care or interest, lives only as he lived-but for ever. 
<P>It is inexhaustible. Every detail of it wins, retains rewards the attention, with a continually increasing   sense of wonderfulness.   It is also <pb id="P.34" n="34"> wholly true. So far as it reaches, it contains the absolute facts of colour, form, and character, rendered with an unaccusable faithfulness <gap>
 What of this man and his house were visible to Holbein are visible to us; <gap> if we care to know anything concerning them, great or small, so much as may by the eye be known, is for ever knowable, reliable, indisputable.</QUOTE> 
<P>The original toll of the Steel Yard merchants was, at Christmas and Easter, <num value="2">two</num> grey cloths and <num value="1">one</num> brown <num value="1">one</num>, with <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> of pepper, <num value="5">five</num> pairs of gloves, and <num value="2">two</num> vessels of vinegar. They had a special alderman for their judge, and they were to be free from all subsidies to the king. 
<P>According to Mr. Hudson Turner, the Steel Yard derived its name not from the steel imported by the Hanse merchants, but from the king's steel yard here erected, to weigh the tonnage of all goods imported into London, the tonnage-office being afterwards transferred to the City.   The king's beam was moved, <num value="1">first</num> to Cornhill, and then to Weigh House Yard, Little Eastcheap. 
<P> <QUOTE>At this time,</QUOTE> says Pennant (in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE>the Steel Yard is the great repository of the imported iron which furnishes our metropolis with that necessary material. The quantity of bars that fill the yards and warehouses of this quarter strike with astonishment the most indifferent beholder. Next to the water-side are <num value="2">two</num> eagles with imperial crowns round their necks, placed on <num value="2">two</num> columns.</QUOTE> 
<P>In few streets of London have more Roman remains been found than in Thames Street.   In <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>, in excavating the ground for rebuilding Dyers' Hall, in College Street, Dowgate Hill, at <num value="13">thirteen</num> feet <num value="8">eight</num> inches below the level of the street, and just above the gravel, the remains were found of a Roman pavement, formed of small pieces of tiles about an inch square, bedded apparently on fine concrete; <num value="2">two</num> thin earthen jars or bottles were also found near the same spot; and <num value="2">two</num> coins, nearly obliterated. The lower part of the ground in which the above were discovered, for <num value="4">four</num> feet <num value="6">six</num> inches in thickness, appeared to be the sediment or earthy matter, from water, probably from the ancient Walbrook; and in it, scattered over the surface, was a large quantity--<num value="2000">twenty hundred</num> weight--of animal bones. 
<P>A fibula or brooch was found in April (<datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>), in an excavation in Thames Street, at the foot of Dowgate Hill. The circular enamelled work in the centre was of a very peculiar description; the outlines of the features of a portrait, and those of the mantle and tunic on the bust (together with the nimbus or crown round the head) were executed in gold, into which enamel appeared to have been worked when in a fluid or soft state. The colours of the enamel were yellow, blue, purple, red, and white. This work was surrounded by a rich filagree border of gold, beautifully worked, in which were inserted, at equal distances, <num value="4">four</num> large pearls. Nothing has hitherto been found that could be compared to this jewel; the gold-work interwoven with the enamel was new to every <num value="1">one</num>. The general character, design, and ornamental goldwork, seemed Byzantine, and somewhat assimilated to the style of art of the time of Charlemagne; so that perhaps we should not be far wrong in assigning its date to the <num value="9">ninth</num> or <num value="10">tenth</num> century. 
<P>As to the old river-side ramparts in Thames Street, Mr. Roach Smith, <num value="1">one</num> of the best-informed antiquaries on Roman London, writing in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, says- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>The line of the wall on the land side is well ascertained; of that portion which Fitzstephens informs us bounded the City on the banks of the Thames, many persons. have hitherto been in doubt, though without reason. At the same time what Fitzstephens adds relative to this wall on the water-side being overturned and destroyed by the water, seems altogether erroneous and improbable, as the Roman masonry is well known to be impervious to the action of that element.   The present Thames Street follows the line of the Roman wall. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct> some valuable contributions to our scanty topographical materials were furnished, which confirm the account given us of the line of the wall by the before-mentioned author. The excavations for sewerage, which led to the discovery I am about to detail, commenced at Blackfriars. The workmen having advanced without impediment to the foot of Lambeth Hill, were there checked by a wall of extraordinary strength, which formed an angle with the Hill and Thames Street. Upon this wall the contractor for the sewers was obliged to open his course to the depth of about <num value="20">twenty</num> feet; so that the greater portion of the structure had to be overthrown, to the great consumption of time and labour.   The delay occasioned by the solidity and thickness of this wall gave us an opportunity of making careful notes as to its construction and courses. 
<P>It extends (as far as I had the means of observing) from Lambeth Hill to Queenhithe, with occasional breaks. In thickness it measured from <num value="8">eight</num> to <num value="10">ten</num> feet. The height from the bottom of the sewer was about <num value="8">eight</num> feet, in some places, more or less; it reached to within about <num value="9">nine</num> feet from the present street, and <num value="3">three</num> from that which indicates the period of the Fire of London, in this district easily recognised.   In some places the <pb id="P.35" n="35"> ground-work of the houses destroyed by the Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct> abut on the wall. 
<P>The foundation was made in the following manner:--Oaken piles were <num value="1">first</num> used; upon these was laid a stratum of chalk and stones, and then a course of hewn sandstones, from <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="4">four</num> feet by <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="2">two</num> and a-half, firmly cemented with the well-known compound of quick-lime, sand, and pounded tile. Upon this solid substructure was built the wall, composed of rag and flint, with layers of red and yellow, plain and curved-edged tiles. The mortar throughout was quite equal in strength to the tiles, from which it could not be separated by force. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> of the most remarkable features of this wall is the evidence it affords of the existence of an anterior building, which, from some cause or other, must have been destroyed.   Many of the large stones above mentioned are sculptured and ornamented with mouldings, which denote their prior use in a frieze or entablature of an edifice, the magnitude of which may be conceived from the fact of these stones weighing, in many instances, half a ton. Whatever might have been the nature of this structure, its site, or cause of its overthrow, we have no means of determining. The probability of its destruction having been effected by the insurgent Britons under Boadicea suggests itself. I observed also that fragments of sculptured   marble had been worked into the wall, and also a portion of a stone carved with an elegant ornament of the trellis-work pattern, the compartments being filled alternately with leaves and fruit.   This has apparently belonged to an altar.   In Thames Street, opposite Queen Street, about <num value="2">two</num> years since, a wall precisely similar in general character was met with, and there is but little doubt of its having originally formed part of the same. 
<P>In the middle of Pudding Lane, running to the bottom, and, as the workmen told me, even across Thames Street, is a strong wall formed of layers of red and yellow tiles and rag-stones, which appeared to have appertained to a building of considerable extent.   The hypocaust belonging thereto was partly laid open. 
<P>In Queen Street, near Thames Street, several walls crossed the street; among them were found <num value="2">two</num> thin bands of pure gold, apparently used for armlets; and midway, opposite Well Court, at the depth of <num value="13">thirteen</num> feet, was a flooring of red tesserae, <num value="14">fourteen</num> feet square.   <num value="3">Three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> feet above ran chalk walls, such as are met with throughout London, which, of course, are subsequent to the Roman epoch. 
<P>Advancing up Bush Lane, several walls of considerable thickness were crossed, which, together with abundance of fresco-paintings, portions of tessellated pavements and tiles, betokened the former appropriation of the site for dwelling-houses. But opposite Scot's Yard a formidable wall of extraordinary thickness was found to cross the street diagonally. It measured in width <num value="20">twenty</num> feet. It was built of flints and rags, with occasional masses of tiles. On the north side, however, there was such a preponderance of flints, and on the south such a marked excess of ragstone, as to justify raising a question as to whether <num value="1">one</num> half might not have been constructed at a period subsequent to the other, though the reason for an addition to a <num value="10">ten</num>-foot wall is not apparent.   So firmly had time solidified the mortar and ripened its power, that the laborers, in despair of being able to demolish the wall, were compelled literally to drill a tunnel through it to admit the sewer.   Whatever might have been the original destination of this wall, whether it formed part of a public building or a citadel, it must have been perverted from its primary destination at some period   during the Roman dynasty.   The excavation was carried to the depth of <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet, the remains of the wall appearing <num value="6">six</num> feet below the street level.   Adjoining the north side of the wall, and running absolutely upon it, was a pavement of white tesserae, together with a flooring of lime and pounded tiles, supporting the tiles of a hypocaust, in rows of about <num value="1">one</num> dozen, <num value="2">two</num> feet apart. 
<P>In Scot's Yard, opposite the great wall, at the depth of <num value="8">eight</num> feet, was another wall, <num value="8">eight</num> feet thick, composed entirely of the oblong tiles and mortar. It descended to the depth of <num value="13">thirteen</num> feet, where, alongside, were pavements of lime and gravel, such, in fact, as are used as substrata for tessellate, and are still, in many parts of the country, employed for the floorings of barns.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Having now visited the chief spots of interest in Upper Thames Street, let us note the chief tribetarries north, for those south are, for the most part, alleys leading to wharves. The <num value="1">first</num>, Addle Hill, like the street before mentioned by us in Aldermanure, bears a Saxon name, either referring to King Athelstan or to the nobles who once dwelt there. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.36.1">St. Bennet, Paul's Wharf</LEMMA>, is a small church rebuilt by Wren after the Great Fire.   Stow mentions the burial here of Edmund Denny, Baron of the Exchequer, whose learned son, Anthony, was gentleman of the bedchamber to Henry VIII.   By his will the Baron desired <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> trentals of masses to be said for his soul and the souls of his father, mother, and <num value="3">three</num> wives.

His monument, for which he left <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>, was destroyed in the Great Fire, that also destroyed his work at St. Paul's. Many of the hair-splitting advocates of Doctors' Commons, and laborious heralds from Heralds' College, are also interred in this tranquil spot.   We may mention Sir William Le Neve (Clarencieux), a friend of Ashmole; John Philpott (Somerset Herald), who spent many dusty days over <title>Camden's Remaines;</title> and, in the north aisle, William Oldys (Norroy), the herald whose eccentricities and love of humming ale we have described in a former chapter. The living is a rectory, in the gift of the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's. 
<P>Boss Alley is so called, says Stow, from a boss of water (small conduit or tap) there placed by the executor of Richard Whittington, who was buried hard by. 
<P>In Lambeth Hill is a warehouse once the Blacksmiths' Hall. The church of St. Mary Mounthaw, close by, was originally a chapel of the Mounthaws, an old Norfolk family, who lived on Old Fish Street Hill, and sold their house to the Bishops of Here-

Old Fish Street Hill and its antecedents we have already glanced at in our chapter on the Fishmongers' Company. It was the early fish market of London before Billingsgate. The stalls, says Stow, <num value="1">first</num> grew to shops, then gradually to tall houses. The change of garden stalls into shops may be very well seen in our suburban roads.

The company of skilled craftsmen seems to have laboured hard to obtain authority over London artists, forgetful of the fact that graining a door has no very near connection with the art of Raphael. Yet, no doubt, there was a time when the illuminator and the house painter were considered kinsmen, and it were well that there was more sympathy now between the higher and lower branches of all professions. 
<P> <QUOTE>The minutes of the Company,</QUOTE> says Peter Cunningham, <QUOTE>commence in the early part of the reign of James I.; some of the entries are curious. Orders were made to compel the foreign painters then resident in London, Gentileschi, Steenwyck, &amp;c., to pay certain fines for following their art, without being free of the Painters'-Stainers' Company. The fines, however, were never paid, the court painters setting the painters'-stainers in the City at defiance.

<P>In the barbarous days of the culinary art, when whales and dolphins were eaten, and our queens quaffed strong ale for breakfast, garlick was a great article of kitchen consumption, and according to Stow, was then sold on Garlick Hill. 
<P>Queen Street, that leads from   Cheapside (in a line with King Street) right down to Southwark Bridge, was <num value="1">one</num> of the improvements after the Great Fire.   It opened out of Soper Lane, and was intended to furnish a direct road to the water-side from the Guildhall, as it still does. College Hill was so called from the College of St. Spirit and St. Mary, founded by Whittington, and described by us in a previous part of the chapter. The Duke of Buckingham's house stood near the top, on the east side. The <num value="2">second</num> and last Duke used to come here and intrigue with the City men of the Puritan party. 
<P>Dowgate Hill leads to <num value="1">one</num> of the old watergates of London, and gives its name to <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="26">twenty-six</num> wards of the City. Stow enumerates <num value="2">two</num> churches and <num value="5">five</num> halls of companies in this ward-All Hallows the More and the Less; Tallow Chandlers' Hall, Skinners' Hall, Maltsters'--Hall, Joyners' Hall, and Dyers' Hall. The Steel Yard, or depot of the Hanse Town merchants, already noticed, is in this ward. Dowgate, or Down-gate, from its rapid descent, was famous in Strype's time for its flooding discharge during heavy rains: Stow mentions a boy losing his footing, and being carried down the stream, in spite of men trying to stop him with staves, till he struck against a cart-wheel, and was picked up dead. Ben Jonson, speaks of

<P>Pennant says that Dowgate (from Dwr, Celtic, 
<hi rend=italics>water</hi>) was <num value="1">one</num> of the old Roman gates of London, where passengers went across by ferry to a continuation of the military way towards Dover. It was a water wharf in the reigns of Henry III. and Edward III.   Customs were paid for ships resting here, in the same manner as if they were at Queenhithe. 
<P>The   Erber (already described) stood   near Dowgate.

Daniel and Eliab Harvey, brothers of Dr. William Harvey, Charles I.'s physician, and the great discoverer of the circulation of the blood, were rich merchants on this hill. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.38.3">The Skinners, whose hall is situated in Dowgate</LEMMA>, were incorporated in the <num value="1">first</num> year of Edward III, (<datestruct value="1327--"><year reg="1327">1327</year></datestruct>), and made a brotherhood in the eighteenth of Richard II.   Their original title is <QUOTE>Master and Wardens, Brothers and Sisters of the Guild or Fraternity of the Skinners of London, to the Honour of God, and the precious Body of our Lord Jesus Christ.</QUOTE> 
<P>Furs, though known to the Saxons, were brought into more general use by the Normans. A statute of Edward III. restricts the wearing of furs to the royal family, prelates, earls, barons, knights, ladies, and rich priests. A charter of Henry VII. enumerates ermine, sables, minever, badger, and many other furs then used to trim coats and gowns. Rabbit skin was also much worn, even by nobles and gentlemen. 
<P>The Skinners had a hall as early as the reign of Henry III.,. and they were among the <num value="1">first</num> of the guilds chartered by Edward III.   In this reign they ranked so high as to venture to dispute precedence with the powerful Fishmongers. This led, in <datestruct value="1339--"><year reg="1339">1339</year></datestruct>, to the celebrated fray, when prisoners were rescued, and <num value="1">one</num> of the Mayor's officers wounded. The end of this was the rapid execution of <num value="2">two</num> of the ringleaders in Cheapside. In the offerings for the French war (<num value="37">37</num> Edward III.) the Skinners contributed <num value="40">40</num>, which was double even the Goldsmiths' subsidy. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1395--"><year reg="1395">1395</year></datestruct>, the Skinners, who had previously been divided into <num value="2">two</num> brotherhoods, <num value="1">one</num> at St. Mary Spital, and the other at St. Mary Bethlehem, were united by Richard II. They then resided in St. Mary Axe, and in Strype's time they removed to Budge Row and Walbrook. In the Great Watch, on the vigil of St. Peter and St. Paul (<num value="6">6</num> Edward IV.), the Skinners rank as <num value="6">sixth</num> among the <num value="12">twelve</num> great <pb id="P.39" n="39"> companies, and sent <num value="20">twenty</num> men to attend. In Richard III.'s time they had stood as <num value="7">seventh</num> of the <num value="13">thirteen</num> mysteries.   They then sent twentyfour members, in murry-coloured coats, to meet the usurper on entering London, the <num value="5">five</num> great companies alone sending <num value="30">thirty</num>; and at Richard's coronation John Pasmer, <QUOTE>pellipar</QUOTE> (Skinner), was in the deputation from the <num value="12">twelve</num> companies, who attended the Lord Mayor as chief butler. 
<P>In the reign of Elizabeth, though the richer furs were less worn, the Skinners were still numerous. They employed <QUOTE>tawyers,</QUOTE> or poor workmen, to dress the coney and other English furs, which pedlars collected from the country people. To restrict merchants from forestalling them in the purchase of furs, the Skinners petitioned Elizabeth for the exclusive monopoly, but were opposed by the Lord Mayor and the Eastland merchants. 
<P>The ordinances of the Skinners in the reign of Edward II. prescribe regulations for importing and manufacturing skins into furs, fixing the number of skins in a package, and forbidding the sale of <num value="2">second</num>-hand furs for new. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> of the great ceremonials of the Skinners' Company was the annual procession on Corpus Christi Day. They had then borne before them more than <num value="200">200</num> painted and gilded wax torches, <QUOTE>burning bright,</QUOTE> says Stow; then came above <num value="200">200</num> chanters and priests, in surplices and copes, singing. After them came the sheriffs' officers, the clerks of the City prisons, the sheriffs' chaplains, mayor's serjeants, the counsel of the City, the mayor and aldermen in scarlet, and lastly the Skinners in their best livery. The guests returned to dinner in the Company's Hall.   On the following Sunday they again went in procession to church, heard a mass of requiem   solemnised for their deceased members, and made offerings.   The bead-roll of the dead was then called, and the Company repeated their orisons.   The priests then said a general prayer for all the surviving members of the fraternity, mentioning each by name. They afterwards returned to their hall, paid their quarterage, and any balances of livery money, and enjoyed themselves in a comfortable but unpretentious dinner, for which they had duly and thriftly paid in advance. Oh, simple life of quiet enjoyment! 
<P>The election ceremonies of the Company are highly curious. <QUOTE>The principals of the Company being assembled,</QUOTE> says Mr. Herbert, <QUOTE>on the day of annual election, <num value="10">ten</num> Christchurch scholars, or 
<Q>Blue-coat Boys</Q> with the Company's almsmen and trumpeters, enter the hall in procession, to the flourish of trumpets. <num value="3">Three</num> large silver cocks, or fowls so named, are then brought in and delivered to the master and wardens. On unscrewing these pieces of plate they are found to form drinking-cups, filled with wine, and from which they drink. <num value="3">Three</num> caps of maintenance are then brought in; the <num value="1">first</num> of these the old master tries on, and finds it will not fit him, on which he gives it to be tried on to several next him.

<P>Strype says the hall in Dowgate was built after the Fire of London at an expense of above <measure value="1800l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1800">1,800</num></measure>. The original hall, <QUOTE>Coped Hall,</QUOTE> had been purchased by the Company as early as the reign of Henry III.   It was afterwards alienated, and passed into the hands of Sir Ralph de Cobham, who made Edward III. his heir. In the later hall the mayors sometimes held their mayoralty, and the new East India Company held its general courts before its incorporation with the old Company. The hall is described in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct> as a noble structure, built with fine bricks, and richly furnished, the great parlor being lined with odoriferous cedar. The hall was altered by Mr. Jupp at the end of the last century. It is an Ionic building, with a rusticated basement. <num value="6">Six</num> pilasters, sustaining an entablature and pointed pediment, divide a double tier of <num value="6">six</num> windows. In the tympanum of the pediment the architect has shown a noble disregard to heraldry by doubling up the supporters of the Company's arms, to fit into the space. The frieze is ornamented with festoons and leopards' heads. A small paved court separates the front from the more ancient building, which is of brick. The hall, a light and elegant apartment, has an Ionic screen. The court-room is no longer wainscoted with odoriferous cedar. The staircase, says Herbert, displays some of the massy and rich ornaments in fashion in the reign of Charles II.

<P> <QUOTE>On the south side of Thames Street,</QUOTE> says Mr. Jesse, <QUOTE>close to where the Steel Yard formerly stood, is the church of All Hallows the Great, anciently called All Hallows the More, and sometimes All Hallows in the Ropery, from its being situated in a district chiefly inhabited by ropemakers. It was founded in <datestruct value="1361--"><year reg="1361">1361</year></datestruct> by the Despencer family, from   whom   the presentation passed by marriage to the Beauchamps, Earls of Warwick, and subsequently to the Crown. <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.40.2">The present uninteresting church</LEMMA>.was built by Sir Christopher Wren, shortly after the destruction of the old edifice by fire in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>. Stow informs us that there was a statue of Queen Elizabeth in the old church, to which the following verses were attached:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=stanza><L>If Royal virtue ever crowned a crown;

<L>Lives still admired, adored, Elizabeth.</QUOTE></QUOTE>
 
<P> <QUOTE>The only object of any interest in the interior of the church is a handsome oak screen, said to have been manufactured in Hamburg, which was presented to the church by the Hanse merchants, in grateful memory of their connection with the parish.</QUOTE> 
<P>The Swan Stairs, a little <QUOTE>above bridge,</QUOTE> was where people coming by boat used to land, to walk to the other. side of Old London Bridge, when the current was swift and narrow between <pb id="P.41" n="41"> the starlings, and <QUOTE>shooting the bridge</QUOTE> was rather like going down the rapids.   Citizens usually took boat again at Billingsgate, as we find Johnson and Boswell once doing, on their way to Greenwich, in <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Dyers' Hall, College Street, was rebuilt about <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>. The Company was incorporated as early as <datestruct value="1472"><year reg="1472">1472</year></datestruct>, and the ancient hall, on the site of Dyers' Hall Wharf, was destroyed in the Great Fire. The Innholders' Hall, in the same street, was also built after the Great Fire. The Company was incorporated in <datestruct value="1515--"><year reg="1515">1515</year></datestruct>.   Joiners' Hall, Joiners' Hall Buildings, has a carved screen and entrance doorway, and the piers are surmounted with the Company's crest--a demi-savage, life-size, wreathed about the head and waist with oak-leaves. The Joiners were   incorporated   about <datestruct value="1567--"><year reg="1567">1567</year></datestruct>.   The Plumbers' Hall, in Great Bush Lane, is a modern brick building. The Company was incorporated by James I. in <datestruct value="1611--"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>. 
<P>The celebrated Calamy gives a curious account of an adventure he met with at Trigg stairs, in this district. <QUOTE>As I was going,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE><num value="1">one</num> day, from Westminster into the City, designing to dine with Sir Richard Levet, I landed at Trigg Stairs. Walking up from the water-side towards Maiden Lane, where he lived, I was overtaken by a woman who had seen me pass by, and ran very eagerly after me, till she was almost out of breath. She seemed greatly frightened, and caught hold of me, begging me, for God's sake, to go back with her. I asked her what the matter was, and what she had to say to me.   She told me there was a man had just hanged himself in a cellar, and was cut down, and she ran up and saw me go by, and was overjoyed at my coming so seasonably, and begged of me, for the Lord's sake, that I would go back with her and pity the poor man. I asked her what she expected from me, and whether she thought I could bring a dead man to life. She told me the man was not dead, but was cut down alive, and come to himself, and she hoped if, at such a season as this, he was seriously talked with, it might do him good. Though I was an utter stranger to this woman, I was yet prevailed with by her earnestness and tears, which were observed by all that passed, to go back with her. She carried me up-stairs into a handsome dining-room. I found a grave, elderly woman sitting in <num value="1">one</num> corner; a younger woman in another; a down-looking man, that had discontent in his countenance, and seemed to be between <num value="30">thirty</num> and <num value="40">forty</num> years of age, in a <num value="3">third</num> corner; and a chair standing in a <num value="4">fourth</num>, as if set for me, and upon that I placed myself.</QUOTE> After reasoning with the man, and endeavouring to restore peace in the family, the good man left.

 because of the ascent from Billingsgate. <QUOTE>In this parish there was a place,</QUOTE> says Stow, <QUOTE>called  <Q>Septem Camerae,</Q>  which was either <num value="1">one</num> house, or else so many rooms or chambers, which formerly belonged to some chantry, the rent whereof went towards the maintaining of a priest to pray superstitiously for the soul of the deceased, who left those septem camera for that use.</QUOTE>

<P>Billingsgate, though a rough and   unromantic place at the present day, has an ancient legend of <pb id="P.42" n="42"> its own, that associates it with royal names and venerable folk. Geoffrey of Monmouth deposeth that about <num value="400">400</num> years before Christ's nativity, Belin, a king of the Britons, built this gate and gave it its name, and that when he was dead the royal body was burnt, and the ashes set over the gate in a vessel of brass, upon a high pinnacle of stone. Stow, more prosaic, on the other hand, is quite satisfied that <num value="1">one</num> Biling once owned the wharf, and troubles himself no further.

 the aspect of Billingsgate. Formerly, passengers embarked here for Gravesend and other places down the river, and a great many sailors mingled with the salesmen and fishermen.   The boats sailed only when the tide served, and the necessity of being ready at the strangest hours rendered many taverns necessary for the accommodation of travellers. <QUOTE>The market formerly opened <num value="2">two</num> hours earlier than at present,</QUOTE> says Mr. Platt, writing in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>and the result was demoralising and exhausting.

As late as <datestruct value="1842"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct> coaches would sometimes arrive at Billingsgate from Dover or Hastings, and so affect the market.   The old circle from which dealers in their carts--attended the market, included Windsor, St. Albans, Hertford, Romford, and other places within <num value="25">twenty-five</num> miles.

 sellers practise many tricks, blowing the cod-fish larger with pipes, and mixing dead eels with live ones. Railways have made fish a main article of food with the London poor, so that, according to Mr. Mayhew, the London costermongers sell onethird of the entire quantity of fish sent to Billingsgate.

As soon as these are gone the costers' sale

 begins.   Many of the costers that usually deal in vegetables buy a little fish on the Friday. It is the fast-day of the Irish, and the mechanics' wives run short of money at the end of the week, and so make up their dinners with fish: for this reason the attendance of costers' barrows at Billingsgate on a Friday morning is always very great. As soon as you reach the Monument you see a line of them, with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> tall fishmongers' carts breaking the uniformity, and the din of the cries and commotion of the distant market begin to break on the ear like the buzzing of a hornet's nest. The whole neighbourhood is covered with hand-barrows, some laden with baskets, others with sacks. The air is filled with a kind of sea-weedy odour, reminding <num value="1">one</num> of the sea-shore; and on entering the <pb id="P.44" n="44"> market, the smell of whelks, red herrings, sprats, and a <num value="100">hundred</num> other sorts of fish, is almost overpowering. The wooden barn-looking square where the fish is sold is, soon after <num value="6">six</num> o'clock, crowded with shiny cord jackets and greasy caps. Everybody comes to Billingsgate in his worst clothes; and no <num value="1">one</num> knows the length of time a coat can be worn until they have been to a fish-sale.   Through the bright opening at the end are seen the tangled rigging of the oyster-boats, and the red-worsted caps of the sailors. Over the hum of voices is heard the shouts of the salesmen, who, with their white aprons, peering above the heads of the mob, stand on their tables roaring out their prices. All are bawling together-salesmen and hucksters of provisions, capes, hardware, and newspapers-till the place is a perfect Babel of competition.

<P>Billingsgate Dock is mentioned as an important quay in Brompton's Chronicle (Edward III.), under the date <datestruct value="976"><year reg="976">976</year></datestruct>, when King Ethelred, being then at Wantage, in Berkshire, made laws for regulating the customs on ships at Blynesgate, or Billingsgate, then the only wharf in London.   i. Small vessels were to pay <num value="1">one</num> halfpenny; <num value="2">2</num>. Larger ones, with sails, <num value="1">one</num> penny; <num value="3">3</num>. Keeles, or hulks, still larger, fourpence.   <num value="4">4</num>. Ships laden with wood, <num value="1">one</num> piece for toll. <hi rend=italics><num value="5">5</num>. Boats with fish</hi>, according to size, a halfpenny and a penny; <num value="6">6</num>. Men of Rouen, who came with wine or peas, and men of Flanders and Liege, were to pay toll before they began to sell, but the Emperor's men (Germans of the Steel Yard) paid an annual toll.   <num value="7">7</num>. Bread was tolled <num value="3">three</num> times a week, cattle were paid for in kind, and butter and cheese were paid more for before Christmas than after. 
<P>By King Stephen's time, according to Becket's friend and biographer, Fitzstephen, the different foreign merchants had drafted off to their respective quays-Germans and Dutch to the Steel Yard, in Upper Thames Street; the French wine merchants to the Vintry.   In the reign of Edward I., a great regulator of the price of provisions, the price of fish was fixed at the following scale:s. d.

<P>In <datestruct VALUE="1699-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct>, an Act of Parliament constituted Billingsgate a free and open market for the sale of fish <num value="6">six</num> days in the week, and on Sundays (before Divine service) for mackerel; and any fishmonger who bought, except for his own sale, was to be sentenced to a fine of <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> for every offence. Several fishery-laws were passed in <datestruct value="1710--"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct>, to restrain abuses, and the selfish greediness of fishermen.   Eel-spears were forbidden, and it was made <pb id="P.45" n="45"> unlawful to use a flue, trammel, hooped net, or double-walled net, or to destroy the fry of fish. No draw-nets were to be shot before sunrise or after sunset. No fisherman was to try for flounders between London Bridge and Westminster more than <num value="2">two</num> casts at low and <num value="2">two</num> at high water. No flounders were to be taken under the size of <num value="6">six</num> inches. No <num value="1">one</num> was to angle within the limits of London Bridge with more than <num value="2">two</num> hooks upon his line; no <num value="1">one</num> was to drag for salmon in the Thames with nets under <num value="6">six</num> inches in the mesh; and all unlawful nets were to be destroyed. 
<P>An Act of the <num value="33">33rd</num> year of George II. was passed, to regulate the sale of fish at Billingsgate, and prevent a monopoly of the market.   It was found that the London fishmongers bought up the fishing-boats, and kept the fish down   at Gravesend, supplying the market with only boatloads at a time, so as to keep up the price. An attempt had been made, in the year <datestruct value="1749"><year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>, to establish a fish-market at Westminster, and fishing-boats were bought by subscription; but the fishmongers prevented any supply of fish reaching the new depot. The Act of Parliament above referred to (<num value="33">33</num> Geo. II) was intended to remedy these evils. The master of every fishing-vessel arriving at the Nore with fish had to report the time of his arrival, and the cargo he brought, to the clerk of the coastoffice, under penalty of <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>; and for any marketable fish he destroyed he was to be sentenced to not less than <num value="1">one</num> month's hard labour. No fish was to be placed in well-boats or store-boats, unless to go straight to Billingsgate, under a penalty of <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>. No <num value="1">one</num> by the same Act was allowed to sell fishspawn, or unsizable fish, or any smelt less than <num value="5">five</num> inches long from nose to tail. 
<P>Stow (Elizabeth) describes Billingsgate as a port or harborough for ships and boats bringing fish, fresh and salt, shell-fish, oranges, onions, fruit, roots, wheat, rye, and other grain. It had become more frequented after the decline of Queenhithe. Steam-vessels, of late years, have superseded the old hoys and sailing-boats that once visited Billingsgate stairs. Steamers are not, of course, dependent on the state of the tide, and the old summons for their departure (under penalty) at the ringing of the bell, which announced high water at London Bridge, is no longer an observance. 
<P>Addison, who glanced at nearly every kind of London life, with his quiet kindly philosophy, and large toleration for folly, did not forget to visit Billingsgate, and refers, in his delightful way, to the debates which frequently arose among <QUOTE>the ladies of the British fishery.</QUOTE> Tom Brown gives a ribald sketch of the fish-fag; and coarse-tongued Ned Ward, that observant publican of Defoe's time, painted a gross Dutch picture of the shrill-voiced, bloated Moll Flagons of the Dark House, scolding and chattering among their heaps of fish, ready enough to knock down the auctioneer who did not knock down a lot to them. 
<P>In Bailey's English Dictionary (<datestruct value="1736--"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct>) a Billingsgate is described as meaning <QUOTE>a scolding, impudent slut,</QUOTE> and Munden, incomparable as Sir Abel Handy, in Morton's excellent comedy of <title>Speed the Plough</title>, when asked about the temper and manners of his wife, replies, in the true Socratic mode, by the query, <QUOTE>Were you ever at Billingsgate in the sprat season?</QUOTE>

<P>The forestallers or middlemen at Billingsgate are called <QUOTE>bummarees</QUOTE> (probably a word of Dutch origin). They buy residues, and sell again in lots, at a considerable profit, to the fishmongers and costermongers. They are said to derive their name from the bumboat-men, who used to purchase of the wind-bound smacks at Gravesend or the Nore, and send the fish rapidly up to market in light carts. 
<P>The costermongers are important people at Billingsgate market.   Sprat-selling in the streets generally commences about the <datestruct value="11-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct> (Lord Mayor's Day), which is accordingly by costermongers sometimes called <QUOTE>Sprat Day.</QUOTE> Sprats continue in about <num value="10">ten</num> weeks. They are sold at Billingsgate by the <QUOTE>toss</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>chuck,</QUOTE> which is about half a bushel, and weighs from <num value="40">forty</num> to <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure>. The price varies from <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure> to <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure> A street sprat-seller can make from <measure value="1s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> to <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> a day, and often more. About <num value="1000">1,000</num> <QUOTE>tosses</QUOTE> of sprats are sold daily in London streets during the season. The real costermonger thinks sprat-selling <hi rend=italics>infra dig.</hi>
 A street shell-fish-seller will make his <measure value="15s." type=currency><num value="15">15</num>s.</measure> a week, chiefly by periwinkles and mussels. The London costermongers, in Mr. Mayhew's time, sold about <num value="770000">770,000</num> pints of shrimps annually, which, at <measure value="2d." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>d.</measure> a pint, a low calculation, amounts to <measure value="6400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6400">6,400</num></measure> yearly. The costermongers sell about <num value="124000000">124,000,000</num> oysters a year, which, at <num value="4">four</num> a penny, the price some years <pb id="P.46" n="46"> ago, would realise   <measure value="129650l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="129650">129,650</num></measure>.   The periwinkles sold in London Mr. Mayhew calculated from good data to be <num value="3600000">3,600,000</num> pints, which, at a penny a pint, gives the large sum of <measure value="15000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="15000">15,000</num></measure>. The sellers of <QUOTE>Wink, wink, winketty, wink, wink,</QUOTE> make, on an average, <measure value="12s." type=currency><num value="12">12</num>s.</measure> a week clear profit in the summer season. Taking fresh, salt, and shell-fish together, Mr. Mayhew calculated that <measure value="1460850l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1460850">1,460,850</num></measure> was spent annually on fish by London street purchasers. 
<P>In the days before railways, when the coaches were stopped by snow, or the river by ice, fish used sometimes to command great prices at Billingsgate. In <datestruct VALUE="1802-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, a cod-fish of <measure value="8l." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num> pounds</measure> was sold to a Bond Street fishmonger for <measure value="1l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1">1</num></measure> <measure value="8s." type=currency><num value="8">8</num>s.</measure> In <datestruct VALUE="1809-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, a salmon of <measure value="19l." type=currency><num value="19">nineteen</num> pounds</measure> went for a guinea a pound. In <datestruct VALUE="1824-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, <num value="3">three</num> lobsters sold for a guinea each; and Mr. Timbs mentions <num value="2">two</num> epicures dividing the only lobster in the market for sauce, and paying <num value="2">two</num> guineas each for the luxury. On the other hand, the prolific sea furnishes sometimes great gluts of fish. <num value="60">Sixty</num> tons of periwinkles at a time have been sent from Glasgow; and in <num value="2">two</num> days from <num value="90">ninety</num> to a <num value="100">hundred</num> tons of plaice, soles, and sprats have been landed at Billingsgate.   Perhaps we may live to see the time when the better sorts of fish will grow scarce as oysters, and cod-fish will have to be bred at the Dogger Bank, and encouraged in its reproduction. 
<P>All fish is sold at Billingsgate by tale, except salmon, which go by weight, and sprats, oysters, and shell-fish, which are sold by measure.   In Knight's <title>London</title> (<datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>), the number of boxes of salmon sent to Billingsgate is said to begin in February at about <num value="30">thirty</num> boxes a day, and to increase in July to <num value="1000">1,000</num> boxes a day.   In <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct> probably not less than <num value="2500">2,500</num> tons of salmon reached Billingsgate.   In <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct> salmon was sent to London in panniers on horseback; after that, it was packed in straw in light carts. After April it was impossible to send the fish to market. About the year <datestruct value="1785"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>, Mr. Alexander Dalrymple, a servant of the East India Company, told a Mr. George Dempster, at the East India House, the Chinese fishermen's mode of conveying fresh fish great distances packed up in snow. Dempster instantly wrote off to a Scotch friend, who had already tried the plan of sending salmon, packed in ice, to London from Aberdeen and Inverness.   In <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct> there were about <num value="60">sixty</num> fish-salesmen in London, and <num value="50">fifty</num> of these had stalls in Billingsgate. 
<P>The old water-gate of Beling, the friend of Brennus the Gaul, was long ago a mere collection of dirty pent-houses, scaly sheds, and ill-savoured benches, with flaring oil-lamps in winter, daybreak disclosing a screaming, fighting, and rather tipsy crowd; but since the extension of the market in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>, and the disappearance of the fishermen, there is less drinking, and more sober and strenuous business. 
<P>Mr. Henry Mayhew has painted a minute yet vivid picture of this great market. <QUOTE>In the darkness of the shed,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>the white bellies of the turbots, strung up bow-fashion, shine like mother-of-pearl, while the lobsters, lying upon them, look intensely scarlet from the contrast. Brown baskets piled upon <num value="1">one</num> another, and with the herring-scales glittering like spangles all over them, block up the narrow paths. Men in coarse canvas jackets, and bending under huge hampers, push past, shouting,  <Q>Move on! move on, there!</Q>  and women, with the long limp tails of cod-fish dangling from their aprons, elbow their way through the crowd. Round the auction-tables stand groups of men, turning over the piles of soles, and throwing them down till they slide about in their slime; some are smelling them, while others are counting the lots.   <Q>There, that lot of soles are worth your money,</Q>  cries the salesman to <num value="1">one</num> of the crowd, as he moves on leisurely;  <Q>none better in the market. You shall have &lsquo;em for a pound and half-a-crown.</Q>   <Q>Oh!</Q>  shouts another salesman,  <Q>it's no use to bother him; he's no go.</Q>  Presently a tall porter, with a black oyster-bag, staggers past, trembling under the weight of his load, his back and shoulders wet with the drippings from the sack.  <Q>Shove on <num value="1">one</num> side,</Q>  he mutters from between his clenched teeth, as he forces his way through the mob. Here is a tray of reddish-brown shrimps piled up high, and the owner busy shifting his little fish into another stand, while a doubtful customer stands in front, tasting the flavour of the stock, and consulting with his companion in speculation. Little girls carrying matting-bags, that they have brought from   Spitalfields, come up, and ask you in a begging voice to buy their baskets; and women, with bundles of twigs for stringing herrings, cry out,  <Q>Halfpenny a bunch!</Q>  from all sides. Then there are blue-black piles of small live lobsters, moving about their bound--up claws and long  <Q>feelers,</Q>  <num value="1">one</num> of them occasionally being taken up by a looker-on, and dashed down again like a stone. Everywhere every <num value="1">one</num> is asking,  <Q> What's the price, master?</Q>  while shouts of laughter, from round the stalls of the salesmen, bantering each other, burst out occasionally over the murmuring noise of the crowd.   The transparent smelts on the marble slabs, and the bright herrings, with the lump of transparent ice magnifying their eyes like a lens, are seldom looked at until the market is over, though the hampers and piles of huge maids,

 <pb id="P.47" n="47"> dropping   slime from   the counter, are eagerly examined and bartered for. 
<P>The costermongers have nicknamed the long row of oyster-boats moored close alongside the wharf  <Q>Oyster Street.</Q>  On looking down the line of tangled ropes and masts, it seems as though the little boats would sink with the crowds of men and women thronged together on their decks. It is as busy a scene as <num value="1">one</num> can well behold. Each boat has its black sign-board, and salesman in his white apron walking up and down  <Q>his shop,</Q>  and on each deck is a bright pewter pot and tin-covered plate, the remains of the salesman's breakfast. Who's for Baker's? <Q> </Q> Who's for Archer's? <Q>   Who'll have Alston's?</Q>  shout the oyster-merchants; and the red cap of the man in the hold bobs up and down as he rattles the shells about with his spade. These holds are filled with oysters--a grey mass of sand and shell- on which is a bushel-measure well piled up in the centre, while some of them have a blue muddy heap of mussels divided off from the  <Q>natives.</Q>  The sailors, in their striped guernseys, sit on the boat-sides smoking their morning's pipe, allowing themselves to be tempted by the Jew boys with cloth caps, old shoes, and silk handkerchiefs.</QUOTE> 
<P>Mr. Mayhew   has   also sketched, with curious photographic realism, the Dutch eel-boats, with their bulging polished oak sides, half hidden in the river mist. They are surrounded by skiffs full of traders from   the Surrey and Middlesex shores. You see wooden sabots and china pipes on the ledges of the boats, and the men wear tall fur caps, red shirts, and canvas kilts.   The holds of the vessels are tanks, and floating at the stern are coffin-shaped barges pierced with holes, with eelbaskets hanging over the sides. In the centre of the boats stand the scales, tall and heavy, with, on <num value="1">one</num> side, the conical net-bag for the eels; on the other, the weights and pieces of stone to make up for the water that clings to the fish. The captain, when purchasers arrive, lays down his constant friend, his black pipe, and dives into the tank   a long-handled landing-net, and scoops from the tank a writhing knot of eels. Some of the purchasers wear blue serge aprons; others are ragged women, with their straw pads on their crushed bonnets They are busy sorting their purchases, or sanding them till they are yellow. 
<P>In old times the Thames fish half supplied London.   Old Stow says of the Thames in his day, <QUOTE>What should I speak of the fat and sweet salmons daily taken in this stream, and that in such plenty (after the time of the smelt is past) as no river in Europe is able to exceed it?   But what store also of barbels, trouts, chevens, perches, smelts, breams, roaches, daces, gudgeons, flounders, shrimps, eels, &amp;c., are commonly to be had therein, I refer me to them that know by experience better than I, by reason of their daily trade of fishing in the same. And albeit it seemeth from time to time to be, as it were, defrauded in sundry wise of these, her large commodities, by the insatiable avarice of fishermen; yet this famous river complaineth commonly of no want, but the more it loseth at <num value="1">one</num> time it gaineth at another.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Stow also tells us that, before <datestruct value="1569--"><year reg="1569">1569</year></datestruct>, the City ditch, without the wall of the City, which then lay open, <QUOTE>contained great store of very good fish, of divers sorts, as many yet living know, who have taken and tasted them, can well witness, but now (he says) no such matter.</QUOTE> Sir John Hawkins, in his edition of Walton's <title>Angler</title> (<datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>), mentions that, about <num value="30">thirty</num> years before, the City anglers were accustomed to enjoy their sport by the starlings of old London Bridge. <QUOTE>In the memory of a person not long since living, a waterman that plied at Essex Stairs, his name John Reeves, got a comfortable living by attending anglers with his boat.   His method was to watch when the shoals of roach came down from the country, and, when he had found them, to go round to his customers and give them notice.   Sometimes they (the fish) settled opposite the Temple; at others, at Blackfriars or Queenhithe; but most frequently about the chalk hills (the deposit of chalk rubble) near London Bridge.   His hire was <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> a tide. A certain number of persons who were accustomed thus to employ him raised a sum sufficient to buy him a waterman's coat and silver badge, the impress whereof was  <Q>Himself, with an angler in his boat;</Q>  and he had annually a new coat to the time of his death, which might be about the year <datestruct value="1730"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> Mr. Goldham, the clerk or yeoman of Billingsgate Market, stated before a Parliamentary Committee that, in <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, <num value="400">400</num> fishermen, each of whom was the owner of a boat, and employed a boy, obtained a good   livelihood by the exercise of their craft between Deptford and London, above and below bridge, taking roach, plaice, smelts, flounders, salmon, shad, eels, gudgeon, dace, dabs, &amp;c. Mr. Goldham   said that about <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct> he had known instances of as many as <num value="10">ten</num> salmon and <num value="3000">3,000</num> smelts being taken at <num value="1">one</num> haul up the river towards Wandsworth, and <num value="50000">50,000</num> smelts were brought daily to Billingsgate, and not fewer than <num value="3000">3,000</num> Thames salmon in the season. Some of the boats earned <measure value="6l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6">6</num></measure> a week, and salmon was sold at <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> and <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>s.</measure> a pound. The fishery was nearly destroyed at the time when this evidence was given, in <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>. The masters of the Dutch eel-ships stated before the <pb id="P.48" n="48"> same committee that, a few years before, they could bring their live eels in <QUOTE>wells</QUOTE> as far as Gallion's Reach, below Woolwich; but now (<datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>) they were obliged to stop at Erith, and they had sustained serious losses from the deleterious quality of the water, which killed the fish. The increase of gas-works and of manufactories of various kinds, and of filth disgorged by the sewers, will sufficiently account for this circumstance.   The number of Dutch eel-vessels which bring supplies to Billingsgate varied, in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>, from <num value="60">sixty</num> to <num value="80">eighty</num> annually. They brought about <num value="15">fifteen</num> hundredweight of fish each, and paid a duty of <num value="13">13</num>.   Mr. Butcher, an agent for Dutch fishermen, stated before the committee above mentioned that, in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, <num value="8">eight</num> Dutch vessels arrived with full cargoes of healthy eels, about <measure value="14000l." type=currency><num value="14000">14,000</num> pounds</measure> each, and the average loss was <measure value="4000l." type=currency><num value="4000">4,000</num> pounds</measure>. <num value="12">Twelve</num> years before, when the Thames was purer, the loss was only <measure value="30l." type=currency><num value="30">thirty</num> pounds</measure> of eels a night; and the witness deposed that an hour after high water he had had <measure value="3000l." type=currency><num value="3000">3,000</num> pounds</measure> of eels die in an hour. (How singularly this accounts for the cheap eel-pie!) The river had been getting worse yearly. Fish were often seen trying to save themselves on floating pieces of wood, and flounders

<P>Bagford, the old antiquary, mentions a curious custom that once prevailed at Billingsgate. <QUOTE>This,</QUOTE> he says, speaking of an old custom referred to in 
<title>Hudibras,</title> <QUOTE>brings to my mind another ancient custom that hath been omitted of late years. It seems that in former times the porters that plyd at Billingsgate used civilly to entreat and desire every man that passed that way to salute a post that stood there in a vacant place.   If he refused to do this, they forthwith laid hold of him, and by main force bouped him against the post; but if he quietly submitted to kiss the same, and paid down sixpence, they gave him a name, and chose some <num value="1">one</num> of the gang for a godfather. I believe this was done in memory of some old image that formerly stood there, perhaps of Belus or Belin.</QUOTE> 
<P>Adjoining Billingsgate, on the east side, stood Smart's Quay or Wharf, which we find noticed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth as containing an ingenious seminary for the instruction of young thieves.   The following extract of a letter, addressed to Lord Burleigh, in <datestruct VALUE="1585-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1585">1585</year></datestruct>, by Fleetwood, the Recorder of London, evinces that the <pb id="P.49" n="49"> <QUOTE>art and mystery</QUOTE> of picking pockets was brought to considerable perfection in the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century :-- 
<P> <QUOTE>Amongst our travels this <num value="1">one</num> matter tumbled out by the way. <num value="1">One</num> Wotton, a gentleman born, and some time a merchant of good credit, having fallen by time into decay, kept   an ale-house at Smart's Key, near Billingsgate; and after, for some misdemeanour, being put down, he reared up a new trade of life, and in the same house he procured all the cut-purses about this city to repair to his said house. There was a school-house set up to learn young boys to cut purses. There were hung up <num value="2">two</num> devices; the <num value="1">one</num> was a pocket, the other was a purse.

<P>The Coal Exchange faces the site of Smart's Quay, Billingsgate. English coal is <num value="1">first</num> mentioned in the reign of Henry III., who granted a charter to the people of Newcastle, empowering them to dig it. Soon afterwards, dyers, brewers, &amp;c., began to use coal in their trade, and the nobles and gentry complaining of the smoke, a severe proclamation was passed against the use of sea-coal, though wood <pb id="P.50" n="50"> was yearly growing scarcer and dearer. Edward I. also issued a proclamation against the use of coal. Nevertheless, a charter of Edward II. shows Derbyshire coal to have been then used in London. In <datestruct value="1590--"><year reg="1590">1590</year></datestruct> (Elizabeth) the owners of the Newcastle coal-pits, combining, raised the price of coals from <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>s.</measure> to <measure value="9s." type=currency><num value="9">9</num>s.</measure> per chaldron; and the following year the Lord High Admiral claimed the coal metage in the port of London. The mayor and citizens disputed and overthrew this claim, and, by the influence of Lord Treasurer Burleigh, obtained the Queen's confirmation of the City's right to the office. At <num value="1">one</num> period in Elizabeth's reign it was prohibited to burn stone-coal during the session of Parliament for fear the health of the members (country gentlemen accustomed to their wood-fires) should be injured. Shakespeare speaks in a cozy way <QUOTE>of the latter end of a sea-coal fire;</QUOTE> but others of the dramatists abuse coals; and the sea-coal smoke was supposed to have much injured the stone of old St. Paul's.   In <datestruct value="1655--"><year reg="1655">1655</year></datestruct> (Commonwealth) the price of coal in London was usually above <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>s.</measure> a chaldron; and there were <num value="320">320</num> <QUOTE>keels</QUOTE> at Newcastle, each of which carried <num value="800">800</num> chaldrons, Newcastle measure; and <num value="136">136</num> of these made <num value="217">217</num> chaldrons, London measure. A duty of only <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure> a chaldron was paid on coals in London, yet the great Protector generously granted the Corporation a licence to import <num value="400">400</num> chaldrons every year for the poor citizens, duty free. The coal-carts numbered <num value="420">420</num>, and were placed under the regulation of the President and Governors of Christ's Hospital; and all coal-sacks and measures were illegal unless sealed at Guildhall.   It was also at this same period generously provided that the City companies should lay up stores of coal in summer (from <num value="675">675</num> chaldrons to <num value="3">three</num>, according to their ability), to be retailed in the winter in small quantities. To prevent extortion, conspiracy, and monopoly, retail dealers, by the same Act, were prohibited under penalties from   contracting for coals, or meeting   the coal-vessels before they arrived in the port of London. 
<P>By statute <num value="16">16</num>. and <num value="17">17</num> Charles II., all sea-coal brought into the river Thames was to be sold by the chaldron, containing <num value="36">thirty-six</num> bushels; and all other coals sold by weight were to be sold after the proportion of <measure value="112l." type=currency><num value="112">112</num> pounds</measure> to the <num value="100">hundred</num> avoirdupois. By the <num value="12">12th</num> Queen Anne, the coal measure was ordered to be made round, and to contain <num value="1">one</num> Winchester bushel and <num value="1">one</num> quart of water; the sack to hold <num value="3">three</num> such bushels; the bushel to be sealed or stamped at the Exchequer Office or the Guildhall, under penalty of <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure>. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1713--"><year reg="1713">1713</year></datestruct> the master-meters of the Coal Office were only allowed to employ or dismiss the deputies sanctioned by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen. An Act of George II. required the ancient custom   to be kept up of giving <num value="1">one</num> chaldron in addition to every score purchased on board ship, under penalty of <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>.   This bonus was called <hi rend=italics>ingrain</hi> and constituted good Pool measure. By a later Act any lighterman receiving any gratuity from owners or fitters for preference in the quality in lading ships was fined <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>.   All bargains for coals at Billingsgate had to be entered on the factor's book, signed by buyer and seller, and witnessed by the factor, who gave a copy of the contract to each. Masters of ships were fined for delaying their cargoes at Gravesend. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.50.1">The old Coal Exchange</LEMMA>, erected in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, for the use of the black-diamond merchants, was a quaint and picturesque building, with a receding portico, supported by small Doric pillars, and with some stone steps, that led into a quadrangle. The narrow windows lit the upper storeys. The present <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.50.2">Coal Exchange</LEMMA> was opened by Prince Albert in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>, and Mr. J. B. Bunning was the architect.   The design was thought original yet simple. The fronts in Thames Street and St. Mary-at-Hill are <num value="112">112</num> feet wide and <num value="61">61</num> feet high. The entrance vestibule is in a circular tower <num value="109">109</num> feet high.   The lowest storey is Roman-Doric; the <num value="1">first</num> storey Ionic. The inner rotunda is crowned by a dome <num value="74">74</num> feet high, which rests on <num value="8">eight</num> piers. About <num value="300">300</num> tons of iron were used in the building.   The Raphaelesque decorations were designed by Mr. Sang. Above emblematical figures of the collier rivers are figures of the Virtues, and over these are groups of shells, snakes, and lizards. In some of the arabesques the leading features are views of the Wallsend, Percy, Pitt Main, and other celebrated collieries, adorned with groups of flowers and fossil plants. 
<P>While digging for the foundation of the new building, on the site of the old <QUOTE>Dog</QUOTE> tavern, the workmen came on a Roman sweating-bath, with tiled floors and several rooms. This hypocaust is still shown. 
<P>The floor of the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.51.1">rotunda</LEMMA> is composed of inlaid woods, disposed, in form of a mariner's compass, within a border of Greek fret. The flooring consists of upwards of <num value="4000">4,000</num> pieces of wood, of various kinds. The varieties of wood employed comprise black ebony, black oak; common and red English oak, wainscot, white holly, mahogany, American elm, red and white walnut, and mulberry. The appearance of this floor is beautiful in the extreme. The whole of these materials were prepared by Messrs. Davison and Symington's patent process of seasoning woods. The same desiccating process has been applied to the wood-work throughout the <pb id="P.51" n="51"> building. The black oak introduced is part of an old tree which was discovered in the river Tyne, where it had unquestionably lain between <num value="4">four</num> and <num value="5">five</num> centuries. The mulberry-wood, of which the blade of the dagger in the shield of the City Arms is composed, is a piece of a tree planted by Peter the Great, when he worked as a shipwright in Deptford Dockyard. 
<P> <QUOTE>The coloured decorations of this Exchange have been most admirably imagined and successfully carried out. They are extremely characteristic, and on this point deserve praise. The entrance vestibule is peculiarly rich and picturesque in its embellishments; terminal figures, vases with fruit, arabesque foliage, &amp;c., all of the richest and most glowing colours, fill up the vault of the ceiling; and, looking up through an opening in the ceiling, a figure of Plenty scattering riches, and surrounded by <hi rend=italics>figurini</hi>, is seen painted in the ceiling of the lantern. Over the entrance doorway, within a sunk panel, is painted the City Arms.</QUOTE>

<P>The various Acts passed from   the time of Henry VIII. gave power to the Company to hold general courts, courts of binding, and courts for hearing and determining complaints, and to punish offenders by fine and imprisonment; power to license passenger-boats, register craft, and to appoint Sunday ferries, the rent of which has always been applied to the relief of the poor of the Company, and to make bye-laws for the regulation of boats, barges, and steam-boats on the river, and the men navigating the same. There are about <num value="356">356</num> apprentices bound annually, and about <num value="250">250</num> complaints. are investigated during the year. The introduction of steam greatly reduced the watermen, but the lightermen and barges have been annually increasing.

Taylor, the water-poet, with his fellow-watermen, violently opposed the introduction of coaches as trade-spoilers.   The Company (says Mr. Timbs) condemned the building of Westminster and Blackfriars bridges, as an injury to the ferries between Vauxhall and the Temple, the profits of which were given to the poor, Aged, decayed, and maimed watermen and their widows; and in both cases the Company were compensated for their losses. The substitution of steam-boats for wherries has, however, been as fatal to the watermen as railways to stage-coachmen. 
<P>The Lord High Admiral, or the Commissioners of the Admiralty, used to have power to demand a certain number of watermen to serve in the Royal Navy, by an Act of William and Mary; and in <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct> nearly <num value="4000">4,000</num> watermen were thus enrolled. The ribald banter of the Thames watermen was for. merly proverbial, and is mentioned by Ned Ward, and nearly all the essayists. Dr. Johnson, Boswell says, was particularly proud of having silenced some watermen who tried to ridicule him. By an <pb id="P.52" n="52"> order of the Company in <datestruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>, this foul kind of extemporaneous satire was forbidden by the rulers and auditors of the Company; and any waterman or apprentice convicted of using indecent language was fined <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> for each offence; the fines to go to the use of the <QUOTE>poor, aged, decayed, and maimed members of the Company, their widows and children.</QUOTE> 
<P>All wherries were formerly required to be <num value="12.50">12 1/2</num> feet long and <num value="4.50">4 1/2</num> broad in the midships, under pain of forfeiture; and all wherries and boats were to be entered and numbered. Extortion and abuse was punishable by fine and   imprisonment.   A statute (<num value="34">34</num> George III.) placed the watermen more immediately under the mayor's jurisdiction;   and   the highest      penalty was fixed at  <measure value="3l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3">3</num></measure>. 
<P>Before the time of steamboats, a bell used to ring at Gravesend   at high water, as a warning to hurry off the   London watermen. A report of the Dock Committee   in <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct> shows that there were   then <num value="12283">12,283</num> watermen,   <num value="8283">8,283</num> freemen, <num value="2000">2,000</num> non-freemen, and <num value="2000">2,000</num> apprentices; the annual number of apprentices being from   <num value="200">200</num> to <num value="300">300</num>.

<P>Close to Waterman's Hall is the Fellowship Porters' Hall. This brotherhood was incorporated as early as <datestruct value="1155"><year reg="1155">1155</year></datestruct> (Henry II.), and re-incorporated in <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct> (James I.). The business of the Fellowship Porters, which is now less strictly defined than in old times, is to carry or house corn, salt, coals, fish, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.052" n="2000.07.0022"><HEAD>The Custom House-Time Of Elizabeth.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 and fruit of all descriptions. There were formerly about <num value="3000">3,000</num> Fellowship Porters; there are now about <num value="1500">1,500</num>.   The Ticket Porters and Tackle Porters have no hall.   The fraternity of Fellowship Porters had the power, by an Act of Council of <datestruct value="1646--"><year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct>, to choose <num value="12">twelve</num> rulers, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen reserving the right to appoint <num value="1">one</num> of the number.

The Company has no livery or arms, and ranks the <num value="19">nineteenth</num> in the order of precedence. 
<P>In   accordance with a pretty old custom, every Sunday before Midsummer Day a sermon is   preached to the Fellowship Porters in the church of St. Maryat-Hill.      They overnight furnish the   merchants and families above Billingsgate with nosegays, and in the morning proceed from the hall to the church, <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="2">two</num>, carrying nosegays.   They walk up the middle aisle to the communion-table, and each places an offering in <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> basins on the communion-rails, for the relief of the Company's poor; and after they have prayed, the deputy, the merchants, their wives, children, and servants walk in order from their seats, and perform the same solemnity. The annual cost of the nosegays amounts to nearly <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>. 
<P>And now we come to that great Government toll-bar, the Customs House. The <num value="1">first</num> building of this kind in London was rebuilt by John Churchman, Sheriff of London, in <datestruct value="1385--"><year reg="1385">1385</year></datestruct> (Richard II.), and it stood on the site of the present buildings.

<P>In Elizabeth's time, the farmers of the Customs <pb id="P.53" n="53"> made immense fortunes. A chronicler of her reign says: <QUOTE>About this time (<datestruct value="1590--"><year reg="1590">1590</year></datestruct>) the commodity of the Custom   House amounted to an unexpected value; for the Queen, being made acquainted, by means of a subtle fellow, named Caerwardine, with the mystery of their gains, so enhanced the rate, that Sir Thomas Smith, Master of the Custom House, who heretofore farmed it of the Queen for <measure value="14000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="14000">14,000</num></measure>. yearly, was   now   augmented to <measure value="42000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="42000">42,000</num></measure>, and afterwards to   <measure value="50000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure>, which, notwithstanding, was valued but as an ordinary sum for such oppressing gaine. The Lord Treasurer, the Earls of Leicester and Walsingham, much opposed themselves against this Caerwardine, denying him entrance into the Privy Chamber, insomuch that, expostulating with the Queen they traduced her harkening to such a fellow's information, to the disparagement of the judgment of her Council, and the discredit of their case. But the Queen answered them, that all princes ought to be, if not as favourable, yet as just, to the lowest as the highest, deciding that they who falsely accuse her Privy Council of sloth or indiscretion should be severely punished; but that they who justly accused them   should be heard. That she was Queen as well to the poorest as to the proudest, and that therefore, she would never be deaf to their just complaints. Likewise, that she would not suffer that those toll-takers, like horseleeches, should glut themselves with the riches of the realm, and starve her exchequer; which, as she will not bear it to be <hi rend=italics>docked</hi>, so hateth she to enrich it with the poverty of the people.</QUOTE> 
<P>The revenue has grown like the green bay-tree of the Psalmist.   In the <num value="1">first</num> year of Elizabeth, the Customs realised <measure value="173846l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="173846">173,846</num></measure>; in her <num value="5">fifth</num> year, <num value="57436">57,436</num>; in her <num value="10">tenth</num>, <measure value="74875l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="74875">74,875</num></measure>.

From   <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>, says D&lsquo;Avenant, the <num value="1">first</num> inspector-general of imports and exports, the revenue derived from the English Customs averaged <measure value="555752l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="555752">555,752</num></measure> a year. From <datestruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1714--"><year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct>, the Customs averaged <measure value="1352764l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1352764">1,352,764</num></measure>.

<P>The Custom House built after the Great Fire was said to have cost <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>. The new Custom House. of <datestruct value="1718--"><year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct> had better-arranged apartments and accommodation for a greater number of clerks. The new building was <num value="189">189</num> feet long, and the centre <num value="29">29</num> feet deep. It was built of brick and stone, and the wings had a passage colonnade of the Tuscan order, towards the river, the upper storey being relieved by Ionic pilasters and pediments. The great feature of the building was the <QUOTE>Long Room,</QUOTE> which, extending the whole length of the centre, was <num value="127">127</num> feet long, <num value="29">29</num> wide, and <num value="24">24</num> high. Here several commissioners superintended personally the numerous officers and clerks of various departments. 
<P>This building, already too small for the evergrowing commerce of London, was destroyed, as before mentioned, in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, by a fire, which also destroyed <num value="10">ten</num> houses on the north side of Thames Street. Cellars and warehouses full of valuable property, and stores of documents and records, were also lost.   But, several years before this catastrophe, the enlargement of the Custom House had been planned. It had been at <num value="1">first</num> proposed to build an additional wing, but on a survey the old building was found too much decayed and dilapidated to warrant much expenditure on its renovation. The Lords of the Treasury selected Mr. Laing's design.   Between the old Custom House and Billingsgate there had been <num value="8">eight</num> quays, equal to <num value="479">479</num> feet; but the site now selected was immediately east of Billingsgate, with only a landingstair between.   It had been suggested to place the Custom House on the north side of Thames Street, so as to save the expense of embankment; but this would have necessitated the widening of many narrow and crooked streets, and the formation of <num value="2">two</num> docks, <num value="1">one</num> east and <num value="1">one</num> west of the quay. The estimate for <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.54.1">the new building</LEMMA> was <measure value="165000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="165000">165,000</num></measure>, exclusive of the format in of the foundation-ground and some other contingencies. The owners of private property claimed <measure value="84478l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="84478">84,478</num></measure>, and were paid <measure value="41700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="41700">41,700</num></measure>. The materials of the old building were sold for <measure value="12400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="12400">12,400</num></measure>. The <num value="1">first</num> necessity was to test the substratum.   The soil was bored with huge augers that screwed down eighteen to <num value="20">twenty</num> feet. A substratum of close gravel, at <num value="1">first</num> promising well, proved to be artificial. The whole ground, from the level of the river to the south side of Thames Street, proved to have once been part of the bed of the, river.   Rushes were found mixed with mussel-shells and the chrysalids of water insects. The workmen also came on <num value="3">three</num> distinct lines of wooden embankments at the distances of <num value="58">58</num>, <num value="86">86</num>, and <num value="103">103</num> feet within the range of the existing wharves; and about <num value="50">fifty</num> from the campshot, or under edge of the wharf wall, a wall built of chalk and rubble, and faced with Purbeck stone, was discovered, running east and west. This was, no doubt, the river rampart of London, mentioned by Fitzstephen. It was so strongly built that it could scarcely be broken even by iron wedges, Many <pb id="P.54" n="54"> coins and other Roman antiquities were found. Rows of piles, <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> and <num value="30">thirty</num> feet long, were then sunk, and on these were placed sleepers of beech fitted in with brickwork. 
<P>The <num value="1">first</num> stone of the new building was laid in <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, by Lord Liverpool, then <num value="1">First</num> Lord of the Treasury, and was opened for business, <datestruct VALUE="1817-05-12"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=12>12</day>, <year reg=1817>1817</year></datestruct>. <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.54.2">The north side fronting   Thames Street</LEMMA>, was plain, but on the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.54.3">south   front</LEMMA> towards the river, the central compartment projected, and the wings had a hexastyle detached Ionic colonnade. The central attic, comprising the exterior of the celebrated <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.54.4">Long Room</LEMMA>, was decorated with alto and basso relievos, representing in allegorical groups the Arts, Sciences, Commerce, Industry, and types of the nations who are our principal commercial allies. The dial-plate, <num value="9">nine</num> feet in diameter, was supported by colossal figures of Industry and Plenty, while the royal arms were sustained by figures of Ocean and Commerce. The Long Room was <num value="196">196</num> feet by <num value="66">66</num>. 
<P>Unfortunately, however, the work was done too 
<FIGURE id="Fig.054" n="2000.07.0023"><HEAD>The Present Coal Exchange.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 cheaply or too quickly, and the foundation gave way. This was bitterly complained of in a Parliamentary Committee of <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, when it was stated that this failure had led to a charge of nearly <measure value="180000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="180000">180,000</num></measure>, in addition to the original expenditure of      <num value="225000">225,000</num>.   The Long Room eventually had to be taken down by Mr. Laing, the architect, the foundations relaid, and the allegorical figures removed. 
<P>The quay is too narrow to afford a good view, but there is a simple grandeur about the design, when seen from   the bridge or river. The water front, says Mr. Platt, is <num value="488">488</num> feet, <num value="90">90</num> feet longer than the old Post Office, and <num value="30">30</num> feet longer than the National Gallery. 
<P>The number of officers and clerks in this great public office is over <num value="60">60</num>o, out and in. The out-door 
<hi rend=italics>employes</hi> are about <num value="300">300</num>.

 <pb id="P.56" n="56"> wards, to see that the tide-waiters put on board discharge their duty properly. The tide-waiters, if the vessel is coming in, remain on board, unless the vessel be in the docks, like men in possession, till the cargo is discharged. The landing-officers, under the superintendence of the surveyors, attend the quays and docks, and take a note of goods as they are craned on shore, and on the receipt of warrants showing that the duties are paid, permit the delivery of goods for home consumption. The officers of the coast department attend to vessels arriving and departing between London and the outports, and give permits for landing their cargoes, and take bonds for the delivery at their destination of goods sent coastwise. They appoint the coastwaiters, who attend the shipping, and discharge all coastwise goods. The searchers see to all goods shipped for abroad, the entries of which, after passing the Long Room; are placed in their hands, and they examine the packages, to see that they duly correspond. As the amount of work fluctuates, and when a special wind blows, flocks of vessels arrive together, the number of supernumeraries employed at the Custom   House is very large. There are sometimes, says a good authority, as many as <num value="2000">2,000</num> persons a day working at Custom House business between Gravesend and London Bridge. 
<P>The Long Room is the department where most of the documents required by the Customs' Laws are received by officials. The <num value="1">first</num> thing necessary upon the arrival of a vessel from a foreign country is the report of the ship, that is, the master must, within <num value="24">twenty-four</num> hours of entering the port, deliver at the Report Office in the Long Room an account of her cargo. Then, before any goods are delivered out of charge by the officers of the out-door department, who board and watch vessels on their arrival, entries of the goods passed also in the Long Room must have reached the officers.   These entries are documents giving particulars of the goods in greater detail than is required in the master's report, and are delivered in the Long Room by the consignees of the cargo, or by their representatives. A single entry may suffice for an entire cargo, if it be all of <num value="1">one</num> kind of goods and be the property of <num value="1">one</num> person, or any number of entries may be necessary if the cargo be varied in nature. The report and the entries--that is, the account of the cargo rendered by the master and that supplied by the consignees--are compared, and delivery of goods not mentioned in the report, though correctly entered, is refused until the omission has been satisfactorily explained. In the case of goods liable to duty, the entries are not suffered to leave the Long Room until it is ascertained that the payment has been made. The entry for such goods, when signed by the Long Room officers, in testimony of its having been passed by them, vouches for the payment of the duty, and constitutes the warrant authorising the officers at the waterside to deliver the goods. Such is the general course of routine applicable to vessels arriving from foreign ports. The officers of the Long Room sit at their desks along the <num value="4">four</num> sides. The visitors are chiefly weather-beaten sea-captains, shipowners, and shipowners' clerks, who come and report arrivals or obtain clearances, and wholesale merchants, who have goods to import or export, or goods to place in bond. 
<P>A correct account is also required of the cargoes of vessels sailing from this country, and the documents by which this is obtained are presented in the Searcher's Office in the Long Room either by the shippers of the goods or by the master of the vessel. The operation performed in the Long Room by the master of an outward-bound ship, which corresponds to the reporting of an arriving vessel, is termed <QUOTE>clearing</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>obtaining clearance.</QUOTE> 
<P>The documents required from the masters of vessels engaged in trade from   <num value="1">one</num> port of the United Kingdom   to another, termed <QUOTE>coasting trade,</QUOTE> are less elaborate. 
<P>From the particulars obtained by the various papers thus delivered in the Long Room, are prepared the monthly returns of trade and navigation, published by the Board of Trade, and the collection and arrangement of the information so obtained occupies a large staff of clerks in the Statistical Department of the Custom House. 
<P>At each outport the room where the business described above is transacted bears the name of the Long Room, although in most cases it is neither long nor in any other way extensive. 
<P>The establishment of docks surrounded by high walls, from   which goods can be removed only through gateways   easily guarded, has made it possible to provide for the security of the duties upon importations with a far less numerous staff of officers than would be necessary if every vessel discharged in the river or at open quays. And the gradual reduction which has taken place in the number of articles in the tariff liable to duty during the last <num value="30">thirty</num> years renders a less rigid examination of goods necessary than was previously requisite. These and other causes enable the present reduced staff to deal efficiently with an amount of business to which under former circumstances it would have been wholly inadequate. 
<P>The warehousing system, which consisted in per- <pb id="P.57" n="57"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.57.1">Advertisement-Hays for Dover-<datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct></LEMMA></NOTE>
 milting the payment of duties upon goods deposited under Crown locks in warehouses duly approved for the purpose by the Board of Customs, to be deferred until the goods are wanted for consumetion, offers great facilities to trade, and is largely availed of. This system involves the keeping of very elaborate accounts, which form the duty of the warehousing departments. 
<P>Of the <num value="170">170</num> or so distinct apartments in the Custom House, all classified and combined to unite order and contiguity, the king is the Long Room, <num value="190">190</num> feet long, <num value="66">66</num> wide, and between <num value="40">40</num> and <num value="50">50</num> feet high. The eye cannot take in at once its breadth and its length, but it is not so handsome as the room that fell in, to the dismay of Mr. Pet. The floor is plank. The cellars in the basement form a groined fireproof crypt. 
<P>The rooms are perfectly plain, all but the Board Room, which is slightly decorated, and contains portraits of George III. and George IV., the latter by Sir Thomas Lawrence.   The Queen's Warehouse is on the ground floor. The entrance to the Custom House is on the north front.   On the southern side there is an entrance from the quay and river. 
<P>Nearly <num value="1">one</num>-half of the Customs of the United Kingdom, says a writer on the subject, are coolleeched in the port of London. In <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, while the London Customs were <measure value="11116685l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="11116685">11,116,685</num></measure>, the total of the United Kingdom were only <measure value="23341813l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="23341813">23,341,813</num></measure>. In the same year the only place approaching London was Liverpool, where the Customs amounted to <measure value="4607326l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4607326">4,607,326</num></measure>. In <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct> the London Customs were <measure value="1070176l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1070176">1,070,176</num></measure>. The same year the declared value of the exports from Liverpool amounted to no less than <measure value="33341918l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="33341918">33,341,918</num></measure>, or nearly <num value="3">three</num> times the value of the exports from London, for in foreign trade London is surpassed by Liverpool. Mr. M&lsquo;Culloch estimates, including the home and foreign markets, the total value of produce conveyed into and from London annually at <measure value="65000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="65000000">65,000,000</num></measure> sterling. 
<P>The number of foreign vessels that entered the port of London in the year <datestruct value="1841"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct> was estimated at <num value="8167">8,167</num>, and the number of coasters at <num value="21122">21,122</num>. The expense of collecting the Customs in Great Britain alone is calculated at over a million sterling. The Board of Commissioners, that sits at the Custom House, has all the outports of the United Kingdom under its superintendence.   It receives reports from them, and issues instructions from the central Board. The recording of the business of the great national firm, now performed by the Statistical Office in the Custom House, was attempted in the reign of Charles II., and urged on the Commissioners of Customs by the bewildered Privy Council for Trade; but it was declared, after many trials, to be impossible. It was <num value="1">first</num> really begun in the business-like reign of William III., when the broad arrow was <num value="1">first</num> used to check thefts of Government property, and when the office of Inspector-General of Imports and Exports was established, and the Custom   House ledger, to record their value, <num value="1">first</num> started. The Act of <datestruct value="1694--"><year reg="1694">1694</year></datestruct> required all goods exported and imported to be entered in the Custom House books, with the prices affixed.   Cotton, therefore, was taxed at this the official value, till <datestruct value="1798"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>.   In this year the Government imposed a convoy duty of <num value="4">four</num> per cent., <hi rend=italics>ad valorem</hi>, upon all exports; and to do this equitably, every shipper of goods was compelled to make a declaration of their then actual value. This was what is called <QUOTE>the declared or real value.</QUOTE> A daily publication, called the <title>Bill of Entry,</title> is issued at the Custom House, to report the imports and exports and the arrival and clearance of vessels. 
<P>Prior to the year <datestruct value="1825"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, says a writer in Knight's 
<title>London,</title> the statutes relating to the Customs had accumulated, from the reign of Edward I., to <num value="1500">1,500</num>, and were naturally as confusing and entangled as they were contradictory. Mr. Huskisson, Mr. J. D. Hume, and eventually the slow-moving Board of Trade, at last revised the statutes, and consolidated them   into <num value="11">eleven</num> acts. They were still further simplified in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, and again consolidated in <datestruct value="1853--"><year reg="1853">1853</year></datestruct>.   <num value="1">One</num> of the Acts passed in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct> enumerates not fewer than <num value="1150">1,150</num> different rates of duty chargeable on imported articles, while the main source of revenue is derived from a very small number of articles. <QUOTE>For example,</QUOTE> says a writer on the subject, <QUOTE><p>the duty on <num value="17">seventeen</num> articles produced, in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>, about <num value="94.50">94 1/2</num> per cent. of the total revenue of Customs, the duties on other articles being not only comparatively unproductive, but vexatious and a hindrance to the merchants, shipowners, and others. In the above year, fortysix articles were productive of <num value="98">98</num> <num value="2">2</num>/<num value="5">5</num> per cent. of the total Customs' revenue. 
<P>The occasional importation of articles which are not enumerated in the tariff of duties is often productive of amusing perplexity. Mr. Huskisson mentioned a case of this nature when he brought forward the plans of consolidation already mentioned. A   gentleman had imported a mummy from Egypt, and the officers of Customs were not a little puzzled by this non-enumerated article. These remains of mortality, muscles and sinews, pickled and preserved <num value="3000">three thousand</num> years ago, could not be deemed a raw material, and therefore, upon deliberation, it was determined to tax them as a manufactured article. The importer, anxious that <pb id="P.58" n="58"> his mummy should not be seized, stated its value at <measure value="400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400">400</num></measure>; and the declaration cost him <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure>, being at the rate of <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> per cent. on the manufactured merchandise which he was about to import. Mr. Huskisson reduced the duties on nonenu- merated manufactured articles from <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> to <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> per cent., and of non-enumerated unmanufactured articles from <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> to <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> per cent.</QUOTE> A somewhat similar case, relating to an importation of ice from Norway, was mentioned in a-debate in the House of Lords in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>. A doubt was started what duty it ought to pay, and the point was referred from the Custom House to the Treasury, and from the Treasury to the Board of Trade; and it was ultimately decided that the ice might be introduced on the payment of the duty on dry goods; but as <num value="1">one</num> of the speakers remarked, <QUOTE>The ice was dissolved before the question was solved.</QUOTE> 
<P>In the time of Charles I. the Customs were farmed, and we find Garrard writing to Lord Stafford, <datestruct VALUE="1634-01-11"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=11>11th</day>, <year reg=1634>1634</year></datestruct>, mentioning that the farmers of the Customs (rejoicing over their good bargains, no doubt), had been unusually liberal in their new year's gifts to the king, having sent him, besides the usual <num value="2000">2,000</num> pieces, <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure> in pieces, and an unset diamond that had cost them <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure>. Yet what a small affair the Customs must have been compared to now, when sugar, tea, tobacco, wine, and brandy produce each of them more than a million a year! 
<P>Defoe says, <QUOTE>In the Long Room it's a pretty pleasure to see the multitude of payments that are made there in a morning. I heard Count Tallard say that nothing gave him so true and great an idea of the richness and grandeur of this nation as this, when he saw it after the Peace of Ryswick.</QUOTE> 
<P>Mr. Platt's account of the working of the Custom House system of <num value="30">thirty</num> years ago shows a remarkable contrast with that of the present day. Writing in the year <datestruct value="1853"><year reg="1853">1853</year></datestruct>, he says, <QUOTE>The progress of an article of foreign merchandise through the Customs to the warehouse or shop of the dealer is as follows :--<num value="1">First</num>, on the arrival of the ship at Gravesend, tide-waiters are put on board and remain until she reaches the appointed landingplace. The goods are reported and entered at the Custom House, and a warrant is transmitted to the landing-waiters, who superintend the unloading of the cargo. A landing-waiter is specially appointed to each ship; officers under him, some of whom are gaugers, examine, weigh, and ascertain the contents of the several packages, and enter an account of them.   These operations are subject to the daily inspection of superior officers. When warehoused, the goods are in charge of a locker, who is under the warehouse-keeper.   When goods are delivered for home consumption, the locker receives a warrant from the Custom House certifying that the goods had been paid; he then looks out the goods, and the warehouse-keeper signs the warrant. When foreign or colonial goods are exported, the process is more complicated.   The warehouse-keeper makes out a  <Q>re-weighing slip;</Q>  a landing-waiter examines the goods, which continue in the charge of the locker, and a cocket, with a certificate from the proper officers at the Custom House, as his authority for their delivery. The warehouse-keeper signs this document, and a counterpart of the cocket, called a  <Q>shipping bill,</Q>  is prepared by   the exporting   merchant. The goods pass from   the warehouse-keeper into the hands of the searcher, who directs a tidewaiter to receive them at the water-side and to attend their shipment, taking an account of the articles; and he remains on board until the vessel reaches Gravesend, when   she is visited   by a searcher stationed there; the tide-waiter is discharged, and the vessel proceeds. But before her final clearance the master delivers to the searcher a document called  <Q>a content,</Q>  being a list of the goods on board, and which is compared with the cocket. It is then only that the cargo can be fairly said to be out of the hands of the Custom House officers.</QUOTE> 
<P>Tide-waiters are not now specially appointed to each ship on arrival. There are no export duties now and no <hi rend=italics>ad valorem</hi> duties. Cockets have been abolished.

<P>It will be seen that the amount of Customs receipts collected in London in each of the years <datestruct value="1870--"><year reg=1870>1870</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg=1871>1871</year></datestruct> was more than that of all the other ports of Great Britain taken together, and <num value="5">five</num> times that of the whole of Ireland. Besides London and Liverpool, there is only <num value="1">one</num>   port in England, Bristol, the Customs receipts of which average a million a year, and <num value="1">one</num> more, Hull, where they are above a quarter of a million. It is to be observed <pb id="P.59" n="59"> that there has been a great reduction of Customs duties of late years. During the <num value="16">sixteen</num> years from <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1872--"><year reg="1872">1872</year></datestruct> the actual diminution of Customs has been no less than <measure value="14255855l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="14255855">14,255,855</num></measure>. 
<P>The annual summary as to trade in the port of London for the year <datestruct value="1872"><year reg="1872">1872</year></datestruct> shows a steady increase in the number of vessels arriving, and a trifling decrease in the departures. A total of <num value="11518">11,518</num> vessels arrived during the year, <num value="7054">7,054</num> of which were sailing and <num value="4464">4,464</num> steam-ships, thus indicating a total increase of   <num value="113">113</num> as compared with the previous year.

<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.60.4">The Tower</LEMMA>       has been the background of all the darkest scenes of English history. Its claims to Roman descent we have before noticed. There can be little doubt that the Roman wall that ran along Thames Street terminated in this fort, within which bars of silver stamped with the name of Honorius have been   discovered.   Our Saxon chapter showed that Alfred unquestionably built a river-side stronghold on the same site. Alfred has been long forgotten within the Tower walls, but the name of Caesar's Tower Shakespeare has, by a few words, kept alive for ever. This castle--for centuries a palace, for centuries a prison, and now a barrack, a show-place, a mere fossil of the sterner ages--was commenced, in its present form, by Gundulf, the Bishop of Rochester, for that stern represser of Saxon discontent, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.60.5">William the Conqueror</LEMMA>. This Benedictine friar, who had visited the East, built the White Tower, the <num value="1">first</num> St. Peter's Church, and the Hall (or Jewel) Tower. He lived to the age of <num value="80">eighty</num>, and saw the Tower completed. 
<P>The next great builder at the Tower was <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.60.6">Henry III.</LEMMA>, who erected Corfe, Conway, and Beaumaris Castles. He added to the tall square White Tower the Water Gate, the great wharf, the Cradle Tower, the Lantern (where his bedroom and private closet were), the Galleyman Tower, and the <num value="1">first</num> wall of the <hi rend=italics>enceinte</hi>. He adorned the St. John's Chapel, in the White Tower, with frescoes, and gave bells to St. Peter's Church on Tower Green. In the Hall Tower, from which a passage led through the Great Hall into the Lantern, he built that small private chapel before whose cross, says Mr. Dixon, Henry VI. was afterwards stabbed. 
<P>The embankment and wharf which the Water Gate commanded was Henry's greatest work. The land recovered from the river, and much exposed i to the sweep of the tide, was protected by piles, <pb id="P.61" n="61">

 enclosed by a front of stone. The London citizens rejoiced when, in <datestruct value="1240--"><year reg="1240">1240</year></datestruct>, the Water Gate and wall both fell, under the action of high spring-tides. <num value="54">54</num> The next year the Barbican fell again, and people said that the spirit of St. Thomas a Becket had appeared, and, indignant at the infringement of <pb id="P.62" n="62"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.62.1">Tower Gate</LEMMA></NOTE>
 public rights, had struck down the walls with a blow of his crucifix.   After wasting more than <measure value="12000bmark" type=currency><num value="12000">12,000</num> marks</measure>, the king at last secured a firm foundation, and reared the Water Gate as it now stands.   The saints obnoxious to the walls raised against London citizens were propitiated by an oratory called the Confessor's Chapel, the martyr giving his name to the gate itself. 
<P>The whole wharf, <num value="1200">1,200</num> feet long, lay open to the Thames, except a patch of ground at the lower end, near the Iron Gate, which led to the Hospital of St. Catherine the Virgin, where sheds and magazines were built (now the docks). To the river-front there were <num value="3">three</num> stairs. The   Queen's Stairs, where royalty landed, lay   beneath   the Byeward Gate and the Belfry, with a passage by bridge and postern through the Byeward Tower into Water Lane. The Water-way passed under St. Thomas's Tower to the flight of steps in Water Lane, and was generally known as <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.62.2">Traitor's Gate</LEMMA>,      the entrance for prisoners.   The Galleyman Stairs (seldom used) lay under the Cradle Tower, by which there was a private entrance to the royal quarters. 
<P>Under the Plantagenet kings, says Mr. Dixon, the Tower warden claimed a right, very obnoxious to the London citizens, of putting <QUOTE>kiddles</QUOTE> or weirs filled with nets in front of the Tower Wharf, and, indeed, in any part of the Thames.   For sums of money any <num value="1">one</num> could buy licences of the Tower wardens to   set kiddles in the Thames, Lea, and   Medway   with nets that stopped even the smallest fish.   Ceaseless we   the complaints of this intolerable injustice, till Richard I. surrendered the Tower rights on religious grounds, for the salvation of his soul and those of his ruthless   ancestors; but the warden soon reasserted his privileges. 
<P>By Magna Charta all kiddles were to be removed from the Thames. The warden still disregarding these claims of the citizens, the Sheriff of London, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, made a raid, and by force of arms destroyed all the obnoxious nets. In the reign of Henry III. this quarrel assumed a more serious aspect.   Enraged at the   kiddles placed   in   the Medway, Jordan de Coventry and a body of armed men proceeded to Yantlet Creek, near Rochester, carried off <num value="30">thirty</num> kiddles, and made prisoners of <num value="5">five</num> men of Rochester, <num value="7">seven</num> men of Strood, and <num value="3">three</num> men of Cliff, with <num value="9">nine</num> other malefactors and threw them into Newgate.   The Rochester men resolved to bring the case before the king, and it was tried at his palace at Kennington. The justiciar who attended for the Crown was a collateral ancestor of Sir Walter Raleigh. The mayor's defence for putting the Kentish men into gaol was that they were infringing the rights of the City, lessening the dignity of the Crown, and, according to an express clause of Magna Charta, incurring the ban of excommunication. The judges agreed with the mayor, and the prisoners were each fined <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure>, and the captured nets were burnt with rejoicings in Westcheape. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.62.3">The White Tower</LEMMA> says the latest chronicler, is <num value="90">ninety</num> feet high, and   from <num value="12">twelve</num> to <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet thick. It is built in <num value="4">four</num> tiers--the vaults, the main floor, the banqueting-floor, and the state floor. Each tier contains <num value="3">three</num> rooms, not counting the stairs, corridors, and small chambers sunk in the solid wall. In each storey there is a large west room running north and   south the whole length of the tower, an east room lying parallel to the <num value="1">first</num>, and a cross chamber at the south-west corner. The rooms are parted by walls never less than   <num value="10">ten</num> feet thick. On each angle of the tower is a turret, <num value="1">one</num> of which is round. The vaults have no stairs or doors of their own. Loopholes in the wall let in the damp river air, but little light.   The cross-chamber vault, or Little Ease, is darker and damper than its <num value="2">two</num> brethren. There is some ground for belief, says Mr. Dixon, that Little Ease was the lodging of Guy Fawkes. On the walls of the vaults are many inscriptions; amongst them   is <num value="1">one</num> of Fisher, a Jesuit priest mixed up in the   Powder Plot.   It runs--

On this tier Bishop Flambard, Prince Griffin, John Baliol, and Prince Charles d&lsquo;Orleans were confined.

<P>On the state-room floor was the great councilchamber, a lesser hall where the justiciaries sat, and the galleries of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.63.3">St. John's Chapel</LEMMA> from which there was a passage into the royal apartments. The roof is flat, and strong enough to bear the carronades of later times. The largest of the <num value="4">four</num> turrets, built for a watch-tower, was the prison of poor Maud Fitzwalter, King John's victim, and was afterwards used as an observatory by Flamstead, Newton's contemporary. 
<P>The Keep, though a palace, was also a fortress, and security, rather than comfort, was what its builder had in view. It had originally only <num value="1">one</num> narrow door, that a single man could defend. <num value="1">One</num> well-stair clone connected the vaults with the upper floors. The main floor had no way up or down, except by the same staircase, which could only be approached through a passage built in the wall. The upper tiers had other stairs for free communication with the council-chamber and the parapets. Thus, we still have existing in the White Tower the clearest and most indelible proofs, better than any historian can give, of the dangers that surrounded the Conqueror, and the little real trust he had in the fidelity of those surrounding him. 
<P>The <num value="2">second</num> church of St. Peter was built by Edward I. The bills for clearing the ground are still preserved in the Record Office in Fetter Lane. The cost of pulling down the old chapel was fortysix shillings and <measure value="8d." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num> pence</measure>. 
<P>The Tower, says Mr. W. Dixon, was divided into <num value="2">two</num> parts, the inner and the outer ward. The inner ward, or royal quarter, was bounded by a wall crowned by <num value="12">twelve</num> towers. The points of defence were the Beauchamp Tower, the Belfry, the Garden Tower (now called the Bloody Tower), the Hall Tower, the Lantern, the Salt Tower, the Broad Arrow Tower, the Constable Tower, the Martin Tower, the Brick Tower, the Flint Tower, the Bowyer Tower, and the Devilin Tower. The inner ward contained the Keep, the Royal Galleries and Rooms, the Mint, the Jewel-house, the Wardrobe, the Queen's Garden, St. Peter's Church, the open Green, and in later days the Lieutenant's house.   In the Brick Tower the master of the ordnance resided; in the Lantern turret lights were kept burning at night as river signals. 
<P>The outer ward contained some lanes and streets below the wall and works which overlooked the wharf. In this ward stood the Middle Tower, the Byeward Tower, the Water Gate, the Cradle Tower, the Well Tower, the Galleyman Tower, the Irongate Tower, Brass Mount, Legge Mount, and the covered ways. Into it opened the Hall Tower, afterwards called the Record Tower, and now the Jewel-house. Close by the Hall Tower stood the Great Hall, the doors of which opened into this outer court. Spanning the ditch on the Thames side was the Water Gate, or St. Thomas's Tower, and under the building was the wide arch so often depicted by painters, and called Traitor's Gate. 
<P>Into the outer ward, says Mr. Dixon, the Commons had always claimed a free access. On stated occasions the right of public entry to all citizens was insisted on with much ceremonial. The aldermen and commoners met in Barking Church on Tower Hill, and chose <num value="6">six</num> sage persons to go as a deputation to the Tower, and ask leave to see the king, and demand free access for all people to the courts of law held within the Tower. They were also to beg that no guard would close the gates or keep watch over them while the citizens were coming or going, it being against their freedom for any but their own guard to keep watch during that period. On the king granting their request the <num value="6">six</num> messengers returned to Barking Church, reported progress, and sent the citizen guard to keep the ground. The Commons then elected <num value="3">three</num> men of standing to act as spokesmen and presenters. Great care was taken that no person should go into the royal presence who had sore eyes or weak legs, or was in rags or shoeless. Every <num value="1">one</num> was to have his hair cut close and his face newly shaved, Mayor, aldermen, sheriff, cryer, beadles, were all to be clean and neat, and every <num value="1">one</num> was to lay aside his cape and cloak, and put on his coat and surcoat. 
<P>The exact site of the <num value="2">two</num> courts of justice Mr. Dixon has clearly made out. The King's Bench was held in the Lesser Hall, under the east turret of the Keep. The Common Pleas were held in the Great Hall by the river--a hall long since gone, but which stood near the Hall Tower, to which it gave a name. It seems to have been a Gothic edifice in the style of Henry III. After Henry VI.'s death, Hall Tower was turned into a Record Office. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> prisoners ever lodged in the Tower that Gundulf built for William the Conqueror was Ralph Flambard, Bishop of Durham, the very treasurer and justiciar who had helped by his cruel greediness to collect the very money by which it was built. On the death of William Rufus, this prelate was seized by the Commons and thrown into the Tower, with the consent of Henry I. He was not kept very close, and <num value="1">one</num> night, plying the Norman soldiers who guarded him with wine, Flambard, who had had ready a coil of rope sent to him in a wine-jar, let himself down from a window <num value="65">sixty-five</num> feet from the ground, and escaped safe to France. 
<P>In the north-east turret of the White Tower King <pb id="P.64" n="64"> John imprisoned Maud, the beautiful daughter of Robert Fitzwalter, Lord of Baynard's Castle, whose untimely fate we have noticed in a former chapter. In the banqueting hall, Edward I. lodged John de Baliol, whom he had stripped of his crown at the battle of Dunbar.   It was from this campaign that Edward returned with the coronation-stone of Scotland, on which our own monarchs have ever since been crowned. Baliol, according to existing records, seems to have lived in state in the White Tower, having his chaplain, tailor, pantler, barber, clerk of the chapel, chamberlain, esquires, and laundress in attendance;   and his dogs and horses in the stables waiting his commands, at the cost of <measure value="17s." type=currency><num value="17">seventeen</num> shillings</measure> a day. He remained a prisoner <num value="189">189</num> days, after which he was given up to the Papal nuncio, John de Pontissera, on condition of residing abroad. <num value="50">Fifty</num> years after another regal Scotchman, David, son of the brave Robert Bruce, was taken prisoner and brought here by Queen Philippa, at the battle of   Neville's   Cross, while Edward was away chastising France. 
<P>Every new   effort to widen England brought fresh prisoners to the Tower, and next came to Flambard's old room, Griffin, Prince of Wales, whom his brother David had surrendered to the English king. Resolute to escape, he tore up his bed-clothes, knotted them into a rope, and dropped <num value="90">ninety</num> feet from the leads of the White Tower Being a heavy man, however the rope unluckily snapped, and he was killed in the fall. His son remained a prisoner, but was afterwards released, returned to Wales, and fought against Edward I. Slain in battle, his head was brought to London, and fixed on the turret of his old prison. 
<P>Edward II. and his cruel queen, Isabella, kept court in the Tower; and here the Prince Joanna de la Tour was born.   John de Cromwell, the Constable, was dismissed from   office for having let the royal bed-chamber become so ruinous that the rain penetrated through the roof.   Here, in Edward's absence, Isabella fell in love with Roger Mortimer, a Welsh chief, who was then in prison in the Tower. By the connivance, no doubt, of the guilty wife, Mortimer escaped by the kitchen chimney, and down the river, to France. His death and the king's barbarous murder at Berkeley Castle were the result of these fatal days of dalliance in the White Tower. 
<P>The Beauchamp Tower, on the west wall of the fortress, derives its name from Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, son of the earl who fought at Crecy and Poictiers.   He was appointed by the House of Commons governor to the young king, Richard II., and his <num value="1">first</num> act, in company with Gloucester, Arundel, and other great barons, was to march on London, and seize and put to death the young king's mischievous favourite, Sir Simon de Burley, whose greediness and insolence had rendered him hateful to the nation. This act of stern justice Richard never forgave; and directly he came of age the earl was banished to his own Warwick Castle, where he built Guy's Tower. The king resolved on obtaining despotic power. The earl was invited to dine with the king, and was seized as he was leaving the royal table, where he had been welcomed with special and treacherous hospitality.   The king's uncle, the good Duke of Gloucester, was decoyed from his castle of Plasley by the king himself, then hurried over to Calais, and   suffocated   by his guards. Lord   Arundel, another obnoxious lord, was also executed by this royal murderer. Beauchamp, in his trial before the House of Peers, pleaded a pardon he had obtained under the Great Seal for all offences. The Chief Justice declared the pardon had been repealed by the king. Ultimately the earl's castles, manors,   and estates were all forfeited, and he was sentenced to be hung; drawn, and quartered.   The king, however, afraid to put to death so popular a man, banished him to the Isle of Man, and then recalled him to his old prison in the Tower. <num value="2">Two</num> years later, on the accession of Henry IV., the earl was released.   He was buried in the nave of St. Mary's Church, Warwick, which he had built. 
<P>The next captive in the banqueting-hall of the White Tower was that poet-warrior, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.64.1">Charles of Orleans</LEMMA>, grandson of Charles V. of France, and father of Louis XII., a gay knight, whom Shakespeare has glanced at in the play of <title>Henry V.</title>
 He had been a rival of Henry (when Prince of Wales) for the hand of Isabella of Valois, the widow of Richard II. She had married him, and died a year after in childbirth.   The young prince shortly after, for reasons of state, was induced to marry a <num value="2">second</num> wife, Bona; daughter of Bernard, Count of Armagnac.   At Agincourt Charles was found sorely wounded among the dead, and carried to England : he was placed in the White Tower, where a ransom of <num value="300000">300,000</num>   crowns was placed upon his head; for the knights of those days, however chivalrous, drove hard bargains with their prisoners. Orleans was <num value="24">twenty-four</num> years old then, and he remained in the Tower <num value="5">five</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num> years. He had a daughter by Queen Isabella, and it was to Henry's interest, as he had married a French princess, and claimed the throne of France, that Orleans should die without having a son. Charles spent the long years of his imprisonment looking out on the Thames and the hills of Surrey, and writing admirable French <pb id="P.65" n="65"> and English verses, which still exist. After Henry's death, and when Joan of Arc had recovered nearly the whole of France, the ransom was raked together, and Charles was released. He then married a <num value="3">third</num> wife, Mary of Cleves, and by her had the son who afterwards became the invader of Italy, Louis XII. 
<P>The reign that saw Charles of Orleans enter the White Tower also saw Sir John Oldcastle, <QUOTE>the good Lord Cobham,</QUOTE> brought to the Beauchamp Tower. This Kentish nobleman, who had fought bravely in France and in Wales, was a favourer of the Lollard reformers, and a despiser of the monks. He accepted Wycliffe's doctrines, denied the real presence, read the Bible openly, and sheltered Lollard preachers. The great enemy of this bold man was Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, who had introduced from Spain the savage custom of burning contumacious heretics.   Disobeying a citation of the primate, Lord Cobham was sent to the Tower. Before a synod Oldcastle boldly asserted the new doctrines, and was sentenced to be burnt to death. <QUOTE>Ye judge the body,</QUOTE> said the old soldier to the synod, <QUOTE>which is but--a wretched thing, yet am I certain and sure that ye can do no harm to my soul. He who created that will of His own mercy and promise save it. As to these articles, I will stand to them even to the very death, by the grace of my eternal God.</QUOTE> 
<P>In the Beauchamp Tower, when the monks spread reports that Cobham had recanted, he issued a bold denial that he had changed his view of <QUOTE>the sacraments of the altar,</QUOTE> of which St. Paul had said to the Corinthians, <QUOTE>The bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ?</QUOTE> 
<P>The people were deeply agitated, and <datestruct value="10-1"><day reg="1">one</day> <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct> night, <num value="4">four</num> weeks after, a band of citizens broke into the Beauchamp Tower (with or without the connivance of the guards), released Cobham, and carried him safely to his own house in Smithfield. There, defying the primate and the monks, Cobham remained for <num value="3">three</num> months. The Lollards at last, probably urged forward by the primate's spies, agreed to meet, <num value="100000">100,000</num> strong, in St. Giles's Fields, and choose Lord Cobham as their general. The king, enraged at this, collected his barons, closed the City gates, put a white crusader's cross on his royal banner, rode with his spears into St. Giles's Fields, and dispersed the Lollard party, who were waiting for the good lord. For <num value="4">four</num> years Cobham wandered through Wales and England, with <measure value="1000bmark" type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num> marks</measure> set on his head.   Fisher, a skinner, the leader of the band that released Oldcastle from the Tower, was tried at Newgate, and afterwards hung at Tyburn, and his head stuck on London Bridge. Eventually, after a hard fight, Oldcastle was betrayed in Wales by a Welsh adherent named   Powis. He was brought to London, and without further trial he was burnt in front of his own house, in Smithfield, the <num value="1">first</num> man there burnt for the true faith. 
<P>In the old monastic plays this brave and consistent man was always represented as a coward and buffoon. Shakespeare himself, following the convention, named his Falstaff at <num value="1">first</num> Oldcastle; then, probably having his attention drawn by some better-read friend to the injustice done to the memory of a good man and true Protestant, he changed it to Falstaff, unfortunately, another brave soldier of Cobham's period, whom tradition had unjustly slandered.   It is a singular fact that a <QUOTE>Boar's Head</QUOTE> in the Borough, not that in Eastcheap, had belonged to the great Falstaff of the French wars. The man who wrote in the epilogue to the <title><num value="2">Second</num> Part of King Henry the <num value="4">Fourth</num>,</title>
 the words <QUOTE>Oldcastle died a martyr,</QUOTE> says Mr. Hepworth Dixon, <QUOTE>was a Puritan in faith.</QUOTE> This dictum   we hold, nevertheless, to be extremely doubtful, as nearly all the religious passages in Shakespeare's plays point to a great reverence for Roman Catholic traditions; and surely an honest writer can free a good man from slander without necessarily believing in his doctrines. Moreover, Lord Cobham was a Protestant, but by no means a Puritan, and probably as far apart in belief from the later martyrs of Smithfield as the Lollards were from John Wesley. 
<P>There is a pretty tradition connected with the Tower in the time of the Wars of the Roses. Sir Henry Wyatt, of Allington Castle, in Kent, father of the poet, and grandfather of the unfortunate rebel, was imprisoned in the Tower for being a resolute Lancastrian. He was thrown into a cold and narrow tower, where he had neither bed to lie on, sufficient clothes to warm him, or enough food to eat. <num value="1">One</num> day a cat came into his dungeon, and he laid her in his bosom to warm him, <QUOTE>and by making much of her won her love.</QUOTE> After this the cat would come several times a day, and sometimes bring him a pigeon.   The gaoler dressed these pigeons, without inquiring where they came from. Sir Henry Wyatt after this retained an affection for cats, and was always painted with <num value="1">one</num> by his side. <num value="1">One</num> day, when Wyatt was being tortured with the barnacles, Richard   III., who was present, exclaimed with regret, <QUOTE>Wyatt, why art thou such a fool? Thou servest for moonshine in water. Thy master,</QUOTE> meaning Henry of Richmond, <QUOTE>is a beggarly fugitive: forsake him and become mine. Cannot I reward thee?</QUOTE> To which Wyatt replied, <QUOTE>If I had <num value="1">first</num> chosen you for my master, thus faithful would <pb id="P.66" n="66"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.66.1">Anne Boleyn Arrested for Tower</LEMMA></NOTE>
 I have been to you if you should have needed it. But the earl, poor and unhappy though he be,. is my master; and no discouragement, no allurement, shall ever drive me from him, by God's grace.</QUOTE> 
<P>And now came, in due sequence, Gloucester's murder of the <num value="2">two</num> princes, his nephews, usually said to have been in the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.66.2">Bloody Tower</LEMMA>,   but the locality of the crime is still uncertain. Bayley, the fullest and best historian of the Tower, thinks it highly unlikely that Gloucester would have sent the <num value="2">two</num> young princes to such a mere porter's lodge as the Bloody Tower--a tower, moreover, which, in an official survey of the reign of Henry VIII., is called the Garden Tower, showing that the popular name is of later date. When sent to what was to be their tomb,   Edward V. was <num value="12">twelve</num>, and Richard, Duke of York, was <num value="8">eight</num>.   They stood between the Crookback and the crown, but not for long. Their mother was in sanctuary at Westminster.   The Protector had already thrown out rumours that the children were illegitimate, and a bishop had been base enough, it is said, to have sworn to a previous secret marriage of the licentious Edward. Lord Hastings, under an accusation of witchcraft, had just been dragged from the council-chamber, and beheaded on a block of timber on Tower Green. Murder followed murder fast, and the word soon went forth for the children's death. Brackenbury, the Governor of the Tower, receiving the order, when on his knees in St. John's Chapel, refused to obey or to understand it. Gloucester, told of this at midnight in Warwick Castle, instantly rose from his bed, and sent Sir James Tyrrell, his Master of Horse, to London, with power to use the keys and pass-words of the Tower for <num value="1">one</num> night. <num value="2">Two</num> dogged ruffians, John Dighton and Miles Forrest, rode at Tyrrell's heels. It is said that <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.66.3"><num value="1">one</num> boy. had his throat cut and the other was smothered with a pillow</LEMMA><NOTE RESP=B><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.66.4">Edward V.</LEMMA></NOTE>.  Tyrrell stood near the gate while the deed was doing, and saw the bodies of the poor children when all was over, then rode back to York to tell Richard. The <num value="2">two</num> murderers, helped by an   obsequious Tower priest, carried down the bodies, dug a hole near the gateway wall, and threw them in. They were afterwards re-interred, in a fit of superstition, by Richard, behind a staircase in the Keep. In Charles II.'s time the bones were found under the steps, and removed to a royal tomb in Henry VII.'s Chapel, Westminster Abbey.   The last-named king had tried hard to find the bodies, and prove that Perkin Warbeck was not the son of Edward IV.; but the priest who had removed them was dead, and the search was unsuccessful.   Sir Thomas More and Lord Bacon both agree that the children were murdered by Richard's command. 
<P>The pride and cruelty of Henry VIII., his theologic doubts, and his Bluebeard habit of getting rid of his wives, sent many victims to the Tower. <num value="1">One</num> of the most venerable of these was John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, a determined opponent of the king's marriage with a Protestant beauty. He was imprisoned in the Belfry Tower, on the ground floor of which lived the Lieutenant. Fisher had professed belief in an hysterical Kentish girl, subject to fits, whom the monks had persuaded to utter rhyming prophecies against the divorce of Queen Catherine. The poor maid of Kent, urged forward by the priests, at last went too far, declaring that, if Henry put away his Spanish wife, he would die in <num value="7">seven</num> months, and his daughter Mary would ascend the throne. Such prophecies, when spread among fanatics, are apt to produce their own fulfilment. Henry gave the signal, and in a very short time the monks who instigated the nun, and the nun herself, were in a cart bound for Tyburn. Fisher himself was soon arrested, and browbeaten by Cromwell, who told him he believed the prophecies true because he wished them to be true. Fisher was <num value="80">eighty</num> years old, and might have been spared, had not Paul III. at that very time, unfortunately, and against the king's express command, sent him a cardinal's hat. <QUOTE>&lsquo;Fore God,</QUOTE> said Henry, with brutal humour, <QUOTE>if he wear it, he shall wear it on his shoulders.</QUOTE> The death-warrant was at once signed. They brought the old man the news that he seemed to have expected, at <num value="5">five</num> a.m. He slept till <num value="7">seven</num>, then rose and donned his bravest suit, for what he called his marriage-day.   He passed to the scaffold with the New Testament in his feeble hands. When he opened the book, he read the passage, <QUOTE>This is life eternal, to know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.</QUOTE> A few hours after the old grey head fell on Tower Hill it was spiked upon London Bridge.   The room   over Coldharbour Gateway, says Mr. Dixon, where the Maid of Kent was imprisoned, was long known as the Nun's Bower. 
<P>The poet Earl of Surrey was another of Henry's victims, and he passed from the Tower to die on the block for blazoning the Confessor's arms upon his shield.   His father, too, the <num value="3">third</num> Duke of Norfolk, had a narrow escape from the same block, though he was a near relation of Henry, and the uncle of <num value="2">two</num> queens. He was charged <measure value="22l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="22">22</num></measure> <measure value="18s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="18">18</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> a month, and yet complained of having no exercise and wanting sheets enough for his bed.

 <pb id="P.68" n="68"> very Pilgrimage of Grace which he had helped to put down. This last great struggle of English Popery against the Reformation brought many of the old North country families to this place of durance. 
<P>The royal decree for putting down monastic houses had, in <datestruct value="1536--"><year reg="1536">1536</year></datestruct>, set all Yorkshire in a ferment. A vast rabble had armed and threatened to march on London, hang Cromwell, weed the Court of evil councillors, restore Queen Catherine, and revive the religious houses; The pilgrims fastened on their breasts scroll displaying the <num value="5">five</num> wounds of Christ.   Near Appleby a band of these fanatics stopped a lawyer named Aske, who was returning to London from a Yorkshire hunting party, and chose him as their general. Aske determined to make Henry Percy, <num value="6">sixth</num> Earl of Northumberland, the commander-in-chief. Percy, who had been a lover of Anne Boleyn, was the Warden of the East and Middle Marches. The earl was afraid to join them; but the pilgrims demanded the earl's brothers, Thomas and Ingram, in spite of the tears and remonstrances of their mother. York at once surrendered to the <num value="30000">30,000</num> pilgrims. At Pomfret Castle they enrolled Lord Darcy among their band. At Doncaster Bridge, however, the Duke of Norfolk met the wild rout, and by proffered pardon and promises of the changes they desired, soon broke up the   host. 
<P>In the meantime lesser rebellions of the same kind prospered for a while. Foremost among the leaders of these were the Bulmers, <num value="1">one</num> of whom had had the command of Norham Castle. Sir John Bulmer brought with him to the camp a dangerous and fanatical woman, named Margaret Cheyne, his paramour, and a bastard daughter of the Duke of Buckingham, whom Henry VIII. had beheaded. When the <num value="1">first</num> pilgrimage failed, and the news came that Cromwell was not disgraced, that no parliament was to be held at York, and that the king would   place garrisons in Newcastle, Scarborough, and Hull, the Bulmers, urged on by this wild   woman and Adam Sedburgh, Abbot of Jervaulx, and the Abbot of Fountains, resolved on a new pilgrimage. Thomas and Ingram Percy had been   deprived   of their command in the North by Earl Henry, and were ready for any desperate effort.     They defied the king's new lieutenant, and prepared for a fresh outbreak. As Norfolk's army approached, the rebels seized Beverley,. and Sir Francis Bigod prepared to fight for the old order of things; but Yorkshire was afraid of the king's power, and a vain attempt on Chillingham Castle, and another on Hull, led to total ruin. A few days more, and the ringleaders were all arrested and packed in the Tower. Aske, Darcy, Bigod, Sir Thomas Percy, the Abbot of Jervaulx, Sir John Bulmer, all perished at Tyburn, and Margaret Cheyne was burnt in Smithfield. 
<P>The next prisoners of importance who came to the Beauchamp Tower, the Garden Tower, and the Nun's Bower, were <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.68.1">Lady Jane Grey</LEMMA>, her young husband, and the ambitious nobles who forced on her the fatal crown to which she was indifferent. The <num value="9">nine</num> days' reign of poor Lady Jane Grey filled the Tower prisons with the Dudleys, who had driven the mild, tender-hearted girl to usurp the crown on the death of Edward VI. With the Queen came Dudley, the Duke of Northumberland; John, the young Earl of Warwick; Lord Robert, already married to luckless Amy Robsart; Lord Ambrose Dudley, a mere lad; Lord Guildford, the weak youth who had married Lady Jane to gratify his father's ambition; and Lord Henry Guildford, his brother.   The duke was shut in the Gate House, Lord Ambrose and Lord Henry in the Nun's Bower, Jane herself in the house of the Deputy-Lieutenant, Lord Robert in the lower tier of the Beauchamp Tower, Lord Guildford in the middle tier. In <num value="2">two</num> places, on the north side of his prison, and, in <num value="1">one</num> instance, just above the name of the Abbot of Jervaulx, Guildford carved his wife's name, <QUOTE>Jane.</QUOTE> 
<P>Lady Jane Grey's claim to the throne arose in this way.   Mary, the sister of Henry VIII., on the death of her husband, Louis XII. of France, married her stalwart lover, Charles Brandon, afterwards Duke of Suffolk. She had issue, <num value="2">two</num> princesses, Frances and Eleanor. Frances married Henry Grey, Marquis of Dorset, and Lady Jane was the eldest of her <num value="3">three</num> daughters. When King Edward, that precocious boy, died--as some still think, of poison-at Greenwich Palace, Dudley kept his death secret for a whole day, and then sent for the Lord Mayor and the richest aldermen and merchants of London, and showed them forged letters-patent giving the crown to Lady Jane, who had already married his son. The duke's <num value="1">first</num> effort was to seize the Princess Mary, but here he failed; faithful friends had instantly warned her of her danger, and she had already taken flight, to rouse her adherents to arms. Lady Jane was then, against her will, proclaimed queen. She was taken to the Tower from Sion House, and was received as a monarch by crowds of kneeling citizens, her husband walking by her side, cap in hand. She refused, however, to let Guildford be proclaimed king, and the lad cried petulantly at her firmness. Mary's friends fast rising in Norfolk, Dudley was sent against them, with a train of guns and <num value="600">600</num> men. As they rode along Shoreditch, the distrusted duke said to <pb id="P.69" n="69"> Lord Grey, <QUOTE>The people press to see us, but no man cries  <Q>God speed you!</Q> </QUOTE> In London all went wrong. Ridley, Bishop of London, denounced 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.69.1">Mary</LEMMA> and Popery, but the crowd was evidently for the rightful heiress. 
<P>The rebellion was soon over. Dudley could do nothing in Norfolk without more men. The great nobles were faithless to the Queen of <num value="9">Nine</num> Days. The <num value="10">tenth</num> day Mary was proclaimed in Cheap, and in St. Paul's Churchyard. The archers came to the Tower and demanded the keys, which were given up. Grey rushed into his daughter's room, and found <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.69.2">Lady Jane</LEMMA>   sitting, unconscious of her fate, beneath a royal canopy. <QUOTE>Come down, my child,</QUOTE> said the miserable duke; <QUOTE>this is no place for you.</QUOTE> From a throne the poor girl passed quickly to a prison. 
<P>In the middle room of the Beauchamp Tower, where Warwick and his brother Guildford were confined, Lord Warwick, in the dreary hours, carved an emblematic cipher of the family names, which has never yet been accurately read.   <num value="2">Two</num> bears and a ragged staff stand in a frame of emblems --roses, acorns, geraniums, honeysuckles-which some folks, Mr. Dixon says, fancy to indicate the initial letters of his kinsmen's names--the rose, Ambrose; the geranium, Guildford; the oak, Robert. Lord Robert (reserved for future greatness) carved in the lower room the plain words, <QUOTE>Robert Dudley.</QUOTE> When sent to the upper room   (probably after Guildford's death), he carved on the wall his emblem, an oak-branch, and the letters <QUOTE>R. D.</QUOTE> 
<P>Lady Jane, with her <num value="2">two</num> gentlewomen by her side, spent her time at Deputy Brydges' house, securely guarded, reading the Greek Testament, and mourning for her father's inevitable fate. Norfolk, released from prison, presided in Westminster Hall at the trial of his enemy, Dudley.   The Duke, Warwick, and Northampton were condemned to death.   Dudley and his son turned Roman Catholics, but failed to avert their doom. Wyat's mad rebellion brought Lady Jane and her foolish husband to the block. On the scaffold she declared her acts against the Queen were unlawful; <QUOTE>but touching the procurement and desire thereof, by me or on my behalf,</QUOTE> she said, <QUOTE>I wash my hands thereof in innocency before God, and in the face of you, good Christian people, this day.</QUOTE> She refused the executioner's help, drew the white kerchief over her own eyes, and said to the kneeling executioner, <QUOTE>I pray you dispatch me quickly.</QUOTE> Kneeling before the block, she felt for it with inquiring hands. As she laid down her fair young head, she exclaimed, <QUOTE>Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit!</QUOTE> and the heavy axe fell. 
<P>It was while Lady Jane and the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.69.3">Princess Elizabeth</LEMMA> were prisoners in the Tower that Wyat's mad rebellion was crushed, and the reckless man himself was locked up in the middle chamber of the Beauchamp Tower. On the slant of the window looking towards the Green can still be seen carved the name of <QUOTE>Thomas Cobham, l<num value="555">555</num></QUOTE> (the cousin of the leader of the rebels). The final break-down of Wyat in his attempt to stop the Spanish   match, we have already described in our chapter on Ludgate Hill, where the last throws of the game were played, and we need not recur to it here. The last moments of Wyat are still to be reviewed. Wyat is described as wearing, when taken prisoner, a coat of mail with rich sleeves, a velvet cassock covered with yellow lace, high boots and spurs, and a laced velvet hat. As he entered the Tower wicket, Sir John Brydges, the Lieutenant, threatened him, and said, <QUOTE>Oh, thou villain-traitor; if it were not that the law must pass upon thee, I would stick thee through with my dagger.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>It is no mastery, now,</QUOTE> said Wyat, contemptuously, and strode on. 
<P>In the Tower, out of the moonshine of vanity and display, Wyat for a time faltered. He made a charge against Courtney, son of the Marquis of Exeter, and a descendant of Edward IV.; and even raised a suspicion against the Princess   Elizabeth, which Renard, the Spanish Ambassador, used with dangerous effect.   Chandos, the Keeper of the Tower, had planned a scene, as Wyat was led td execution, that should draw from him   an open accusation of Elizabeth and Courtney.   On his way to death he was taken into the Garden Tower, where Courtney lay.   The Lord Mayor and the Privy Council were there, Courtney himself was brought in, but Wyat had nothing to allege. On the scaffold Wyat told the people that he had never accused either the Princess or Courtney of a knowledge of the plot; and a priest, eager for fresh victims, reminded him that he had said differently at the Council. <QUOTE>That which I then said, I said,</QUOTE> replied Wyat; <QUOTE>that which I now say is true.</QUOTE> And the axe fell. 
<P>The Courtney mentioned above was nearly all his life a prisoner in the Tower. His father was executed for treason by Henry VIII. On Mary's accession he was released, and seemed for a time to have persuaded himself that she would accept him   as a husband.   He was made     Earl of Devon, and was called by his friends <QUOTE>the White Rose of York.</QUOTE> As the Spanish marriage drew near, people began to mention Courtney as a fine husband for Elizabeth, who seems to have really had some youthful liking   for the weak, handsome   aspirant. On the outbreak of Wyat's rebellion he was again <pb id="P.70" n="70"> thrown into the Tower.   After Mary's marriage, however, he was released and sent abroad.   He died suddenly at Padua.   On Courtney's death the house of York was represented by the descendants of the Duke of Clarence, Edmund and Arthur, nephews of the Cardinal Pole. For some vague suspicion of encouraging the claim of Mary Queen of Scots to the English throne they were imprisoned for life in the Tower. In the Beauchamp Tower inscriptions by both brothers are still to be seen. Arthur has written, among other inscriptions-

<P>And now we come to Elizabeth's prisoners, the Roman Catholic plotters against her throne and life. In a room of the Belfry Tower are the names of the Countess of Lennox and her <num value="5">five</num> attendants. This countess was <num value="1">first</num> cousin to Elizabeth, and married by Henry to the <num value="4">fourth</num> Earl of Lennox. While Elizabeth was proposing Lord Robert Dudley to Mary as a husband, offering, as the condition of her accepting a Protestant husband, to at once appoint Mary heir to the throne, the Countess of Lennox was proposing her son Darnley, a Catholic. Immediately before the latter marriage taking place the countess was sent to the Tower, not to be released till Darnley's miserable death. Lennox himself was assassinated, and the countess, released from the Tower, died poor, and was buried in Westminster Abbey at the Queen's expense. 
<P>Of other victims of Mary Queen of Scots the Tower bears traces. <num value="1">One</num> of these was a young Fleming, named Charles Bailly, who was employed by the ambassador in London, John Leslie, the intriguing Bishop of Ross, to carry dangerous letters to Brussels and Madrid, respecting the plots of the Duke of Norfolk. In vain Elizabeth had said to the duke, <QUOTE>Take care, my lord, on what pillow you lay your head.</QUOTE> He plotted on till he blundered into the Tower.   The Earl of Northumberland collected <num value="10000">10,000</num> men, in hope to rescue Mary and restore the Catholic religion, and in a few days was a hunted fugitive. Norfolk was released after many lying promises. The Bishop of Ross at once determined on a new effort.   A Papal bull was to be launched, deposing the Queen; the Catholic lords were to seize the Tower; Norfolk was to march to Tutbury, rescue Queen Mary, and bring her to London to be crowned. In the meantime he wrote a treasonable book, which was printed at Li&egrave;ge, entitled <title>A Defence of the Honour of Mary, Queen of Scotland.</title> Bailly, on his return with the book and some dangerous letters referring to Norfolk, was arrested at Dover.   The Cobham   already mentioned as <num value="1">one</num> of Wyat's adherents, having charge of the prisoner and the letters, and being a Catholic, resolved to befriend the bishop.   He therefore sent him the letters to change for others of a more harmless character. Burleigh, however, by a Catholic spy, discovered the truth, and put Charles Bailly to the rack. The plot disclosed led to the instant arrest of the Duke of Norfolk and the Bishop of Ross.   In the good Lord Cobham's room Charles has inscribed the following words : 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote>I.H.S. <datestruct value="1571--"><year reg="1571">1571</year></datestruct>. Die <num value="10">10</num> Aprilis.

<P>In a prison in the Tower the Bishop of Ross confessed the Norfolk and Northumberland plots, and declared Mary's privity to the death of Darnley. He has left his name carved in the Bloody Tower, with a long Latin inscription, now half erased. <pb id="P.71" n="71"> Eventually, squeezed dry of all secrets, and full of cramps and agues, he was contemptuously released and sent abroad.   Norfolk died denouncing his religion, and begging pardon of the Queen. He was the <num value="1">first</num> political offender who suffered in Elizabeth's reign. Northumberland was executed at York, and left his title to his brother Henry, who perished in the Tower.   The new earl soon fell into treason. Misled by Jesuit intriguers, he was waiting for the landing of the Duke of Guise and a Catholic crusade against Elizabeth, when he was thrown into the Tower, where he remained a whole year in the Bloody Tower untried.   On Sunday, <datestruct VALUE="1585-06-21"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=21>21</day>, <year reg=1585>1585</year></datestruct>, he shot himself as he lay in bed, to prevent the confiscation of his estates. An absurd rumour was spread by the Catholics that the earl was murdered by order of Hatton and Raleigh. Cecil and Raleigh's other rivals did their best to perpetuate such   a calumny.   A modern   historian, in the face of all evidence, has given affected credence to the report. 
<P>Another pseudo-Catholic martyr of this reign was Philip Howard, a son of the Duke of Norfolk and Mary the daughter of the Earl of Arundel, a weak intriguing   man. He   has left in the large room   of the Beauchamp   Tower this inscription, carved in an Italian hand:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote>The more suffering for Christ in this world, so much the more glory with Christ in the life to come--ARUNDELL. <datestruct VALUE="1587-06-22"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=22>22</day>, <year reg=1587>1587</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Arundel was a pervert,   and had been captured while on his way to join the army of Philip of Spain. Having lost favour with Elizabeth for having gone over to the Church of Rome, Arundel had despaired of further progress at Court, and had fled to Spain on the very eve of the Armada.   By means of bribes paid by his wife, Arundel contrived to have mass celebrated in his cell. For this offence he was condemned to death; but the Queen pardoned the poor fanatic, and he lingered in prison for <num value="10">ten</num> years, at the end of which he died-poisoned, as the Jesuits said; but more probably from the injury he had done his health by repeated fasts. 
<P>Of that wilful and unfortunate favourite of Elizabeth, the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.71.1">Earl of Essex</LEMMA>, we shall say little here. His story belongs more naturally to another part of our work--the chapter on the Strand, where he lived. His rash revolt we have already glanced at. At the age of <num value="35">thirty-five</num> he laid down his head on the block on Tower Green.   He was attended by <num value="3">three</num> divines, to whom he expressed deep penitence for his <QUOTE>great sin, bloody sin, crying and infectious sin,</QUOTE> and begged pardon of God and his sovereign. He never mentioned his wife, children, or friends; took leave of no <num value="1">one</num>, not even of those present; and when he knelt down to pray, exhibited considerable agitation of mind. 
<P>On James's accession, that great man, yet not without many a stain, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.71.2">Sir Walter Raleigh</LEMMA>, became a tenant of the Bloody Tower.   He had been imprisoned before by Elizabeth in the Brick Tower; for having seduced Elizabeth Throgmorton, <num value="1">one</num> of her maids of honour. 
<P> <QUOTE>A very great part of the <num value="2">second</num> and long imprisonment of the founder of Virginia,</QUOTE> says Mr. Dixon, <QUOTE>was spent in the Bloody Tower and the adjoining Garden House, writing at this grated window, working in the little garden on which it opened, pacing the terrace on this wall, which was afterwards famous as Raleigh's Walk. Hither came to him the wits and poets, the scholars and inventors of his time--Jonson and Burrell, Hariot and Pettto crack light jokes, to discuss rabbinical lore, to sound the depths of philosophy, to map out Virginia, to study the shipbuilder's art. In the Garden House he distilled essences and spirits, compounded his great cordial, discovered a method (afterwards lost) of turning salt water into sweet, received the visits of Prince Henry, wrote his political tracts, invented the modern war-ship, wrote his  <Q>History of the World.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P>Raleigh   was several times in the Tower; but many vaults and cells pointed   out by the warders in absurd places-such as the hole in Little Ease, a recess in the crypt, a cell in the Martin Tower, and <num value="1">one</num> in the Beauchamp Tower--were never occupied by him. After the seduction of his future wife, Raleigh was placed in the Brick Tower, the residence of Sir George Carew, Master of the Ordnance, and his own cousin, and was released upon his marriage. As a <num value="1">first</num> step towards peace with Spain, James I., on his accession, imprisoned Raleigh in the Bloody Tower.   The pretext for his seizure was his aiding Lord Cobham, the brother-in-law of Cecil, in a plot to raise Arabella Stuart to the throne.   Cobham, clinging to life with the baseness of Claudio, in <title>Measure for Measure</title>, accused Raleigh of complicity, and   then retracted.   A report was spread that Raleigh had tried to stab himself while sitting at the Lieutenant's table.   He remained a prisoner for <num value="14">fourteen</num> years. His wife and son were allowed to live at the Tower, where her husband and his <num value="3">three</num> poor servants lived on <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> pounds</measure> a week. He was at last, from poverty, obliged to part with his faithful friend, Thomas Hariot, whom he had sent to Virginia in <datestruct value="1584--"><year reg="1584">1584</year></datestruct>, and whose mathematical discoveries Descartes is said to have stolen. 
<P>During this long imprisonment, Raleigh was allowed to use a hen-roost in the garden near the <pb id="P.72" n="72"> Bloody Tower as a place for distilling and for chemical experiments. There he made balsams and cordials, and occupied himself with many sciontiff inquiries. When increased suspicions fell on Raleigh, he was deprived of this still-room, and his wife and <num value="2">two</num> children (for a <num value="2">second</num> son had been born since his imprisonment) were sent from the Tower. He then became so ill from the chill of the cell that he was allowed to live in the Garden House, which had been the still-room where he studied. Here he discovered a cordial still used by doctors; here he discoursed of naval battles with Prince Henry, who, after <num value="1">one</num> of these visits, cried out to his attendants, <QUOTE>No man but my father would keep such a bird in a cage.</QUOTE> Here he finished the <num value="1">first</num> volume of his <title>History of the World,</title> assisted, it is said, by Ben Jonson and other scholars.   Here, bit by bit, King James stripped him of houses and lands, including Durham House and Sherborne Castle. 
<P>After his release and unsuccessful voyage to seek for gold in Guiana, Raleigh returned to the Tower, and was placed in a poor upper room of the Brick Tower.   He had at <num value="1">first</num> pleasant rooms in the Wardrobe Tower. But Spain had now resolved on his death, and James was ready to consent. His enemies urged him in vain to suicide. The morning he died, Peter, his barber, complained, as he dressed his master to go to the scaffold, that his head had not been curled that morning. <QUOTE>Let them comb it that shall have it,</QUOTE> answered Raleigh. 
<P>In a chamber of the house of the Lieutenant of the Tower, looking out on the Thames, several oak panels bear inscriptions, some of them probably 
<FIGURE id="Fig.072" n="2000.07.0029"><HEAD>The Church Of St. Peter On Tower Green.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 written by King James, to record the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot; for in this chamber Guy Fawkes was <num value="1">first</num> examined by Cecil, Nottingham, Mountjoy, and Northampton.   <num value="2">Two</num> of the inscriptions run thus:--

 but, after <num value="30">thirty</num> minutes of the rack, he confessed all.

To the last Fawkes affirmed that when the conspirators took oath in his lodgings in Butcher's Row, Strand, Father Gerard, who administered the sacrament, was ignorant of the purpose of their oath. Fawkes, with Keyes, Rookwood, and Thomas Winter, were drawn on hurdles to Palace Yard, and there hung and disembowelled.   Digby, Robert Winter, Grant, and Bates were hung near Paul's Cross.

Garnet's servant, Little John, in fear of the rack, stabbed himself in his cell. On the scaffold before St. Paul's, Garnet asserted the virtue of Anne Vaux, with whom it is certain he had carried on an intrigue, and hoped the Catholics in England would fare no worse for his sake.

<P>Another Tower prisoner in this reign was the 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.73.2">Earl of Northumberland</LEMMA>, a patron of science. His kinsman, Thomas Percy, had been deep in the plot, and was the man who hired the cellar where the barrels of powder were laid. He was allotted a house in the Martin Tower, at the north-east angle of the fortress, afterwards the Jewel House, where Colonel Blood made his impudent dash on the regalia. There he remained for <num value="16">sixteen</num> years, pacing daily on the terrace which connected his rooms with the Brick Tower and the Constable's Tower, and which still bears his name. A sun-dial fixed for him on the south face of the Martin Tower, by the famous astronomer Hariot, is still to be seen there. Accused of wishing to put himself at the head of the English Catholics, he was fined <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure>, deprived of all his appointments, and sentenced to imprisonment for life. He spent his time in mathematical studies, and kept Hariot by his side. He was a friend of Raleigh, and was visited by men of science. He was at last released by the intercession of his beautiful daughter Lucy, who had married Hay, a Court favourite, afterwards Earl of Carlisle. 
<P>Nor must we forget that fair prisoner, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.74.1">Arabella Stuart</LEMMA>, a kinswoman of James, who was sent to the Tower for daring to marry her relation, William Seymour, who was also of royal descent. Seymour escaped to France, but she remained <num value="5">five</num> years in the Tower, in neglect arid penury, and died at last, worn out with pining for freedom, her mind a wreck. <pb id="P.74" n="74"> 
<P>The murder of Sir Thomas Overbury in the Tower is <num value="1">one</num> of the darkest of the many dark pages in the reign of James I. It was the last great crime committed in the blood-stained building where so many good and wise men had pined away half their lives. Overbury, a poet and statesman of genius, was the friend of the king's young Scotch favourite, Carr. When a handsome boy he had been injured in a tilt, and had attracted the king's attention. James, eager to load his young Ganymede with favours, wedded him to the divorced wife of Lord Essex, a beautiful but infamous woman, whose <num value="1">first</num> marriage had been conducted at Whitehall with great splendour, Inigo Jones supplying the scenery, and Ben Jonson, in beautiful verse, eulogising the handsome couple in fallacious prophecies.   Carr ruled the king, and Overbury ruled Carr. All went well between the <num value="2">two</num> friends, who had begun life together, till Overbury had exerted himself to prevent Carr's marriage with the divorced Lady Essex. The lady then resolved on his death. She tried to bribe assassins and poisoners, and, all these plans failing, the king was persuaded to send him as an envoy to Moscow.   Overbury refusing to go, was thrown into the Bloody Tower. Here Lady Essex exerted all her arts to take away his life. An infamous man, named Sir Gervaise Helwyss, was appointed Lieutenant of the Tower, and a servant of Mrs. Turner, the infamous poisoner (mentioned in our, chapter on Paternoster Row), placed as keeper in the Bloody Tower. Poisoned jellies and tarts were frequently sent to Overbury by Lady--Essex in the name of Carr, and poisons were mixed in almost everything he took. Yet so strong was the poet's constitution, that he still bore up, till a French apothecary was sent to him, who administered medicines that soon produced death. The marriage of Lady Essex and Carr, now made an earl, soon took place, and was celebrated with great splendour at Whitehall. The Earl of Northampton, who had aided Lady Essex in this crime, died a few months afterwards, and all was for a time hushed up. In the meantime Overbury's friends had printed his fine poem of 
<title>The Wife</title> (the model of virtue held out for his friend's example), and <num value="5">five</num> editions of the poem had roused public attention. Just at this time, a boy employed in the Tower by the French apothecary who gave Overbury his <hi rend=italics>coup de grace</hi>, fell sick in Flanders, and confessed his crime to the English resident. Gradually the murder came out. The Lieutenant of the Tower half confessed, and the criminals were soon under arrest.   Hands were also laid on Carr and his wife, Mrs. Turner, Weston, the man placed in charge of Overbury, and an apothecary, Franklin. The nation was infuriated and cried for vengeance. There were even rumours that the same wretches had poisoned Prince Henry, the heir to James's throne. Helwyss was hung in chains on Tower Hill; Mrs. Turner at Tyburn; Franklin and Weston were contemptuously put to death. The trial of the greater culprits followed. The countess pleaded guilty, and was condemned to death; and in Carr's case the chief evidence was suppressed. Eventually the earl and countess were pardoned. They left the Bloody Tower and the Garden House, and lived in seclusion and disgrace. The only child of these murderers was the mother of that excellent Lord William Russell who was afterwards beheaded. 
<P>Mention of every State prisoner whom the Tower has housed would in itself fill a volume. We must therefore confine ourselves to brief notices of the greater names. Nor must his innocence prevent our mentioning, after the murderers, of Overbury, that patriarch of English philosophy, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.74.2">Lord Bacon</LEMMA>
 who, on his sudden fall from greatness, when Buckingham threw him as a sop to appease the people, was confined here for a period which, though short, must have been <num value="1">one</num> of extreme mental agony. He was only imprisoned <num value="1">one</num> day in the Lieutenant's house. <QUOTE>To die in this disgraceful place, and before the time of His Majesty's grace, is even the worst that could be,</QUOTE> said the great man, whose improvidence and whose rapacious servants had led him to too freely accept presents which his enemies called <QUOTE>bribes.</QUOTE> 
<P>But we must hasten on to the reign of Charles, when Felton struck that deadly blow in the doorway at Portsmouth, and Charles's hated favourite, the Duke of Buckingham, fell dead. Felton, an officer whose claims had been disregarded, had stabbed the duke, believing him to be a public enemy. He was lodged in the Bloody Tower, and as he passed to his prison the people cried, <QUOTE>The Lord bless thee!</QUOTE> The Parliament Remonstrance against the duke, which Felton had read in the <QUOTE>Windmill</QUOTE> Tavern, in Shoe Lane had <num value="1">first</num> roused him to the deed. The turning-point of Charles's fate was the committal of the <num value="9">nine</num> members- Holles, Eliot, Selden, Hobart, Hayman, Coryton, Valentine, Strode, and Long--to the Tower. They had carried resolutions against the tax by tonnage and poundage   proposed by the king.   These men, so active against Laud and despotic power, were lodged in the Lieutenant's House.   <num value="2">Two</num> were at once pardoned; the others were heavily fined. The ringleader, Eliot; refused to retract, died in confinement, resolute to the last, and he was buried in the Tower. <pb id="P.75" n="75"> 
<P>Then came to the Tower that tough, obstinate lawyer, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.75.1">Prynne</LEMMA>, who, for an attack on theatres, was put in the pillory, fined <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure>, and had both his ears shorn off.   After <num value="4">four</num> years' imprisonment Prynne again attacked <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.75.2">Archbishop Laud's</LEMMA> Popish practices, and was again punished. But the tide was now turning.   Presently through the Tower gates passed <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.75.3">Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford</LEMMA>, that dark bold spirit that had resolved to brave it out for despotism, and in the attempt was trodden under foot. Charles gave him up to the people, in <num value="1">one</num> of his feeble and vain attempts to conciliate those whom he had wronged. When there was fear Strafford might be torn to pieces on his way to the scaffold, he said, <QUOTE>I care not how I die, by the executioner or by the people.</QUOTE> He stopped under Laud's window for his blessing,   but Laud, in the act of blessing, swooned.    <num value="4">Four</num> years after Laud also perished on Tower Hill. As he went to the scaffold, says his last historian, his face turned from purple to ghastly white. A poor, narrowminded, cruel man, it is a pity his enemies did not send him over to France, and there leave him to trim altars and arrange processions to his heart's content. 
<P>The Tower prisoners of Charles II.'s time were men of less mark and of less interest. The <num value="1">first</num> offender was <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.75.4">James Harrington</LEMMA>, the author of that political romance, <title>Oceania,</title> the publication of which Cromwell had been too magnanimous to resent. He eventually became insane, and after several changes of prison, died and was buried next Raleigh, in St. Margaret's Church.   In the same foolish revelling reign the Duke of Richmond got shut up in the Tower for <num value="3">three</num> weeks, being compromised for proposing marriage to Frances Terese, <num value="1">one</num> of the king's mistresses (the <QUOTE>Britannia</QUOTE> of our English halfpence). The Duke eventually eloped with her, but he survived the marriage only a few years. In <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct> Baron Morley was sent to the Tower for stabbing a gentleman named Hastings in a street fight, with the help of a duellist named Captain Bromwich.   He pleaded benefit of clergy, and peers being, at that period of our history, allowed to murder without punishment, he was acquitted. 
<P>The half-mad Duke of Buckingham seems to have been fond of the Tower, for he was no less than <num value="5">five</num> times imprisoned there. The <num value="1">first</num> time (before the Restoration), Cromwell had imprisoned him for marrying the daughter of Fairfax. The last time, he accompanied Shaftesbury, Salisbury, and Wharton, for opposing the Courtier Parliament. <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.75.5">Penn</LEMMA>, the eminent Quaker, was also imprisoned in the Tower in Charles's reign, nominally for writing a Unitarian, pamphlet, but really to vex his father, the Admiral, who had indirectly accused the Duke of York of cowardice at sea, on the eve of a great engagement with the Dutch.   Stillingfleet at last argued the inflexible prisoner into Christianity, and he was released. 
<P>When, on the discovery of the Rye House Plot, 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.75.6">Lord William Russell</LEMMA> was arrested, he was sent to the Tower <num value="1">first</num>, and then to Newgate. <QUOTE>Arbitrary government cannot be set up in England,</QUOTE> he said to his chaplain, <QUOTE>without wading through my blood.</QUOTE> The very day Russell was removed from his prison, and Charles II. and James visited the place, the Earl of Essex, in a fit of despair at being mixed up in the Rye House Plot, or from fears at his own guilt, killed himself with a razor. He was imprisoned at the time in lodgings between the Lieutenant's house and the Beauchamp Tower. Lord Stafford (<num value="1">one</num> of the victims of Titus Oates and his sham Popish Plot) was imprisoned in the Tower, and perished under the axe on Tower Hill. When the rabble insulted him, Stafford appealed to the officials present.   Sheriff Bethel brutally replied, <QUOTE>Sir, we have orders to stop nobody's breath but yours.</QUOTE> 
<P>Another victim   of this reign was the famous 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.75.7">Algernon Sidney</LEMMA>. a stern opponent of Charles, but no plotter against his person. The wretch <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.75.8">Jeffreys</LEMMA>
 hounded on the jury to a verdict. Sidney's last words in court were a prayer that the guilt of his death might not be imputed to London. On his way to Tower Hill, he said, <QUOTE>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and I die for the old cause.</QUOTE> 
<P>Another turn of Fortune's wheel, and James, 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.75.9">Duke of Monmouth</LEMMA>,the fugitive from Sedgemoor, was found half-starved in a ditch, and was brought to his prison lodgings at the Lieutenant's house. He proved a mere craven, offered to turn Catholic to save his life, and talked only of his mistress. Tenison, the Vicar of St. Martin's Church, refused him the sacrament, and the last words of the prelates in attendance were, as the axe fell, <QUOTE>God accept your imperfect repentance.</QUOTE> 
<P>James fled, and the next State prisoner was that cruel and brutal myrmidon of his, Judge Jeffreys. Detected in the disguise of a sailor, he was taken, and with difficulty saved from the enraged mob. He was discovered at a low ale-house in Wapping by a man whom he had once bullied and frightened in court. He spent his time in the Bloody Tower drinking, of which he at last died. He was at <num value="1">first</num> buried near the Duke of Monmouth, then removed to St. Mary Aldermary.   Our readers will remember the cruel jest played upon Jeffreys in the Tower, by a man who sent him a barrel, <pb id="P.76" n="76"> apparently full of Colchester oysters, but which when opened proved to contain only a halter. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>, when Sir John Fenwick was in the Tower for a plot to assassinate King William, his friends, afraid he would <QUOTE>squeak,</QUOTE> interceded that he should be beheaded.   It was certainly very unlike a gentleman to swing, but he was so proud of being beheaded, that he grew quite tractable when the request was granted. 
<P>The Scotch Jacobite lords were the next visitors to the Tower.   When the white cockade was trodden into the mire, the leaders of the chevalier's followers soon found their way there. The Earl of Derwentwater (about whom so many north-country ballads exist) and <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.76.1">Lord Kenmure</LEMMA>, the grandson of Charles II., perished on Tower Hill. Derwentwater's last words were, <QUOTE>I die a Roman Catholic. I am in perfect charity with all the world; I thank God for it. I hope to be forgiven the trespasses of my youth by the Father of infinite mercy, into whose hands I commend my soul.</QUOTE> Kenmure, who had expected a pardon, came on the scaffold in a gay suit. <QUOTE>God bless King James,</QUOTE> he cried, as he knelt to the block. Lord Winton filed the bars of his window, and escaped. 
<P>Lord Nithsdale also escaped, thanks to his brave wife. His escape is <num value="1">one</num> of the prettiest romances connected with the Tower.   Failing to obtain mercy from George I., who shook her from him, she struck out, in her love and despair, a stratagem worthy, of a noble wife. With the help of some female friends and a useful Welsh servant girl, she disguised her husband as her maid, and with painted cheeks, hood, and muffler, he contrived to pass the sentries and escape to the house of the Venetian agent. The next morning the earl would have perished with his comrades. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1722--"><year reg="1722">1722</year></datestruct>, Pope's friend Atterbury, the Jacobite Bishop of Rochester, was thrown into the Tower, and, with ferocious drollery, it was advised that he should be thrown to the Tower lions. Layer; a barrister, <num value="1">one</num> of his fellow-conspirators, was chained in the Tower and soon after executed. The unlucky &lsquo;<num value="45">45</num> brought more Scottish lords to the Tower; the Earl of Cromartie, the Earl of Kilmarnock, Derwentwater's younger brother, Lord Balmerino, and that hoary old rascal, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.76.2">Simon, Lord Lovat</LEMMA>, whom   Hogarth sketched on his way to London, as he was jotting off the number of the rebel clans on his mischievous old fingers. Cromartie was spared: of the rest, Kilmarnock died <num value="1">first</num>; then the scaffold was strewn with fresh sawdust, the block new covered, a new axe brought, and the executioner re-clad, by the time old Balmerino appeared, calm and careless, as with the air of an old soldier he stopped to read the inscription upon his own coffin. At Lovat's execution, in <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct>, a scaffold fell with some of the spectators, and the doomed man chuckled and said, <QUOTE>The mair mischief, the mair sport.</QUOTE> <QUOTE lang=la>Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori,</QUOTE> said the greatest rascal of his day; and then declaring himself a true Catholic, Lovat died, the last State criminal beheaded on Tower Hill. A stone with <num value="3">three</num> rude circles in St. Peter's Church marks the grave of the <num value="3">three</num> Scotch Jacobites. 
<P>Of Wilkes's imprisonment in the Tower we shall have occasion to speak elsewhere. 
<P>Then came other days, when Pitt frightened England with rumours of revolutionary conspiracies. The leaders of the London. Corresponding Society, and the Society for Constitutional Information, were seized in I<num value="794">794</num>-the Habeas Corpus Act being most tyrannically suspended. Among the reformers then tried on a charge of constructive treason were Horne Tooke, the adversary of Junius, Thelwall, and Hardy, a shoemaker (secretary of the Corresponding Society). Erskine defended Hardy, who was acquitted; as also were Home Tooke and Thelwall, to the delight of all lovers of progress. 
<P>Sir Francis Burdett's story will come more naturally into our Piccadilly chapter, but a few facts about his imprisonment in the Tower will not be out of place. In <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct> he was committed by a Tory House of Commons for a bold letter which he had written to his constituents on the case of John Gale Jones, a delegate of the Corresponding Society, who had been lodged in Newgate for a libel on the House. Burdett denied the power of the House to order imprisonment, or to keep men in prison untried. 
<P>The year <datestruct value="1816"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct> brought some less noble prisoners than Sir Francis to the Tower.   The Spa Fields riots were followed by the arrest of Watson, a bankrupt surgeon, Preston, a cordwainer, and Hooper, a labourer, all of whom were members of certain socialist clubs. 
<P>The desperate but foolish Cato Street conspirators of <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct> were the last State prisoners lodged in the Tower, which Mr. Dixon seems to think was thus robbed of all its dignity. The cells that have held Ings, the butcher, and Davidson, the negro, can never be perfumed sufficiently to hold noble traitors or villains of mediaeval magnitude. Thistlewood, that low Cataline, who had served in the army, was lodged in the Bloody Tower, as the place of honour, Brunt in the Byeward Tower, Ings and Davidson in the Water Gate, and Tidd in the <num value="7">Seven</num>-Gun Battery. <pb id="P.77" n="77">

<P>The present Jewel House at the Tower is the old Record Tower, formerly called the Hall Tower. 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.77.4">The regalia</LEMMA> were originally kept in a small building at the south side of the White Tower, but in the reign of Charles I. they were transferred to a strong chamber in the Martin Tower, afterwards called the Jewel Tower, which being damaged in the great fire of <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, the warders removed the regalia to the governor's house. <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.77.5">The new Jewel House</LEMMA> was erected the same year, and is more commodious than the old room. 
<P>Here you see the types of power and sovereignty. The collection is surmounted by the imperial State crown of Her Majesty Queen   Victoria.   This crown, says Professor Tennant, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>was made by Messrs. Rundell and Bridge, in the year <datestruct value="1838"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>, with jewels taken from old crowns, and others furnished by command of Her Majesty. It consists of diamonds, pearls, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds, set in silver and gold; it has a crimson velvet cap with ermine border, and is lined with white silk. Its gross weight is <num value="39">39</num> oz. <num value="5">5</num> dwt. troy The lower part of the band, above the ermine border, consists of a row of <num value="129">129</num> pearls, and the upper part of the band a row of <num value="112">112</num> pearls, between which, in front of the crown, is a large sapphire (partly drilled), purchased for the crown by His Majesty George IV. At the back is a sapphire of smaller size, and <num value="6">six</num> other sapphires (<num value="3">three</num> on each side), between which are <num value="8">eight</num> emeralds. 
<P>Above and below the <num value="7">seven</num> sapphires are <num value="14">fourteen</num> diamonds, and around the <num value="8">eight</num> emeralds <num value="128">128</num> diamonds.   Between the emeralds and sapphires are <num value="16">sixteen</num>   trefoil ornaments, containing <num value="160">160</num> diamonds. Above the band are <num value="8">eight</num> sapphires, surmounted by <num value="8">eight</num> diamonds, between which are <num value="8">eight</num> festoons, consisting of <num value="148">148</num> diamonds. 
<P>In the front of the crown, and in the centre of a diamond Maltese cross, is the famous ruby, said to have been given to Edward, Prince of Wales, son of Edward III., called the Black Prince, by Don Pedro, King of Castile, after the battle of Najera, near Vittoria, A.D. <datestruct value="1367"><year reg="1367">1367</year></datestruct>.   This ruby was worn in the helmet of Henry V. at the battle of Agincourt, A.D. <datestruct value="1415"><year reg="1415">1415</year></datestruct>. It is pierced quite through, after the Eastern custom, the upper part of the piercing being filled up by a small ruby. Around this ruby, to form the cross, are <num value="75">seventy-five</num> brilliant diamonds.   <num value="3">Three</num> other Maltese crosses, forming the <num value="2">two</num> sides and back of the crown, have emerald centres, and contain respectively <num value="132">132</num>, <num value="124">124</num>, and <num value="130">130</num> brilliant diamonds. 
<P>Between the <num value="4">four</num> Maltese crosses are <num value="4">four</num> ornaments in the form of the French fleur-de-lis, with <num value="4">four</num> rubies in the centres, and surrounded by rose diamonds, containing respectively eightyfive, <num value="86">eighty-six</num>, <num value="86">eighty-six</num>, and <num value="87">eighty-seven</num>   rose diamonds. 
<P>From the Maltese crosses issue <num value="4">four</num> imperial arches, composed of oak-leaves and acorns; the leaves   containing <num value="728">728</num> rose, table, and brilliant diamonds; <num value="32">thirty-two</num> pearls forming the acorns, set in cups containing <num value="54">fifty-four</num> rose diamonds and <num value="1">one</num> table diamond.   The total number of diamonds in the arches and acorns is <num value="108">108</num> brilliant,   <num value="116">116</num> table, and <num value="559">559</num> rose diamonds. 
<P>From   the upper part of the arches are suspended <num value="4">four</num> large   pendant pear-shaped   pearls, with rose diamond   caps, containing <num value="12">twelve</num> rose diamonds, and stems containing <num value="24">twenty-four</num> very small rose diamonds.   Above the arch stands the mound, containing in the lower hemisphere <num value="304">304</num> brilliants, and in the upper <num value="244">244</num> brilliants; the zone and arc being composed of <num value="33">thirty-three</num> rose diamonds.   The cross on the summit has a rosecut sapphire in the centre, surrounded by <num value="4">four</num> large brilliants, and <num value="108">108</num> smaller brilliants.</QUOTE>

<P>The <hi rend=italics>King's Sceptre with the Dove</hi> is gold, in length <num value="3">three</num> feet <num value="7">seven</num> inches, and about <num value="3">three</num> inches in circumference. It is set with diamonds and other precious stones, and upon the mound at the top, which is enriched with a band or fillet of rose diamonds, is a small cross, whereon is fixed a dove with wings expanded, as, the emblem of mercy. 
<P>The <hi rend=italics>Queen's Sceptre with the Cross</hi> is also of gold, adorned with diamonds and other precious stones, and in most parts is very like the king's, but not wreathed, nor quite so large. 
<P>The <hi rend=italics>Queen's  Ivory Rod</hi>, which was made for Queen Mary, consort of James II., is a sceptre of white ivory <num value="3">three</num> feet <num value="1">one</num> inch and a half in length, with a pommel, mound, and cross of gold, and a dove on the top. 
<P>Besides these there is another very rich and elegant sceptre with a dove, which was discovered in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct> behind a part of the. old wainscot of the Jewel House, where it seems to have lain unobserved for a great number of years.. This nearly assimilates to the king's sceptre with the dove, and there is every probability that it was made for Queen Mary, consort of William III., with whom she was jointly invested with the exercise of the royal authority. 
<P>The <hi rend=italics>Ampulla</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>Eagle of Gold</hi>, which contains the holy oil at the ceremony of the coronation, is in the form of an eagle, with wings expanded, standing on a pedestal, all of pure gold finely chased. The head screws off about the middle of the neck, for the convenience of putting in the oil, which is poured out through the beak into a spoon called the anointing-spoon, which is likewise of pure gold, with <num value="4">four</num> pearls in the broadest part of the handle. These are considered to be of great antiquity. 
<P><hi rend=italics>Curtana</hi>, or  the <hi rend=italics>Sword of Mercy</hi>, which is borne naked before the king, between the <num value="2">two</num> swords of justice, at the coronation, is of. plain steel, gilded. The blade is <num value="32">thirty-two</num> inches in length, and nearly <num value="2">two</num> in breadth; the handle is covered with fine gold wire, and the point flat. The <hi rend=italics>Swords of justice</hi>
 are the spiritual and temporal, which are borne, the former on the right. hand and,--the latter on the left, before the king or queen at their coronation. The point of the spiritual sword is somewhat obtuse, but that of the temporal sword is sharp. Their blades are about <num value="40">forty</num> inches long, the handles cased with fine gold wire, and, the scabbards of all <num value="3">three</num> are alike, covered with a rich brocaded cloth of tissue, with a fine ferule, hook, and chape. 
<P><hi rend=italics>Armillae</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>Bracelets</hi>, which are ornaments for the king's wrist, worn at coronations, are of solid fine gold, an inch and a half in breadth, and edged with- rows of pearl.   They open by means of a hinge, for the purpose of being put on the arm, and are chased with the rose, thistle, fleur-de-lis, and harp. 
<P>The <hi rend=italics>Royal Spurs</hi> are also made of fine gold, curiously wrought, and are carried in the procession at coronations by the Lords Grey of Ruthyn, a service which they claim by descent from the family of Hastings, Earls of Hastings. 
<P>The <hi rend=italics>Saltcellar of State</hi>, which is said to be a model in gold of the White Tower, a grand silver font, double gilt, generally used at the baptisms of the royal family, and a large silver fountain, presented to Charles II. by the town of Plymouth, are likewise worthy of notice; and there is also deposited in the Jewel House a magnificent service of communion-plate belonging to the Tower Chapel; it is of silver, double gilt, superbly wrought, the principal piece containing a beautiful representation of the Lord's Supper. 
<P>The summary of jewels comprised in the crown is as follows :--  large ruby, irregularly polished; <num value="1">1</num> large broad-spread sapphire; 	<num value="16">16</num> sapphires; <num value="11">11</num> emeralds; <num value="4">4</num> rubies; <num value="1363">1,363</num> brilliant diamonds; <num value="1273">1,273</num> rose diamonds; <num value="147">147</num> table diamonds; <num value="4">4</num> drop-shaped pearls; and <num value="273">273</num> pearls. 
<P>A curious fact in connection with the regalia is related by Haydon the painter. The crown, he says, at George IV.'s coronation, <QUOTE>was not bought, but borrowed. Rundell's price was   <measure value="70000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="70000">70,000</num></measure>; and Lord Liverpool told the king he could not sanction such an expenditure.   Rundell charged <measure value="7000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="7000">7,000</num></measure> for the loan, and as some time elapsed before it was decided whether the crown should be bought or not, Rundell charged <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure> or <measure value="4000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4000">4,000</num></measure> more for the interval.</QUOTE> 
<P>The crown jewels have been exhibited for a fee since the restoration of King Charles II. They had been before that period kept sometimes in the Tower, in the treasury of the Temple or other religious house, and in the treasury at Westminster. The royal jewels have on several occasions been pledged to provide for the exigencies of our monarchs, by Henry III., Edward III., Henry V., Henry VI.; and Richard II. offered them to the merchants of London as a guarantee for a loan. The office of Keeper of the Regalia, conferred by <QUOTE>the king's letters patent,</QUOTE> became, in the reign of the Tudors, a post of great emolument and dignity, and <QUOTE>The Master of the Jewel-House</QUOTE> took rank as the <num value="1">first</num> knight bachelor of England; the office was some time held by Cromwell, afterwards Earl of Essex. During the civil war under Charles I. the regalia were sold and destroyed. On the restoration <pb id="P.81" n="81"> of Charles II. new regalia were made, for which the king's goldsmith, Sir Robert Vyner, was paid <measure value="21978l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="21978">21,978</num></measure> <measure value="9s. 11d." type=Currency><num value="9">9</num>s. <num value="11">11</num>d.</measure> 
<P>At the great fire of <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct> the grating was broken open and the jewels removed for safety. Mr. G. Cruikshank made a clever drawing of this scene. 
<P>The history of the regalia would be incomplete without some short mention of Blood's desperate and impudent attempt to steal the crown, globe, and sceptre, in the reign of Charles II.   This villain, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.81.1">Blood</LEMMA>, had been a lieutenant in Cromwell's army, and had turned Government spy. He had joined in a plan to seize Dublin Castle and kill the Lord Lieutenant. He had actually stopped the Duke of Ormond's coach in Piccadilly, carried off the duke, and tried to hang him at Tyburn, a plan which had all but succeeded; and the Duke of Buckingham   was suspected by the Ormond family of having encouraged the attempt. In the attempt on the regalia Blood had <num value="4">four</num> accomplices. Blood, disguised. as a country parson, in band and gown, began the campaign by going to see the crown with a woman who passed for his wife. This woman, while seeing the jewels, pretended to be taken ill, and was shown into the private rooms of Talbot Edwards, the. old Deputy Keeper of the Crown Jewels, a man <num value="80">eighty</num> years of age. Blood then observed the loneliness of the Tower, and the scanty means of defence. He called <num value="4">four</num> days later with a present of gloves for Mrs. Edwards, and repeated his visits, till he at last proposed that his nephew, a young man, as he said, with <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure> or <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure> a year, should marry the old man's daughter. He finally fixed a day when the young bridegroom should present himself for approval. On the appointed day he arrived at the outside of the Iron Gate with <num value="4">four</num> companions, all being on horseback.   The plan for action was fully matured. Hunt, Blood's son-in-law, was to hold the horses, and keep them   ready at St. Catherine's Gate. Parrot, an old Roundhead trooper and now a Government spy, was to steal the globe while Blood carried off the crown, and a <num value="3">third</num> accomplice was to file the sceptre into pieces and slip them into a bag. A <num value="4">fourth</num> rogue represented the lover. The <num value="5">five</num> men were each armed with sword-canes, sharp poignards, and a brace of pistols. While pretending to wait for the arrival of his wife; Blood asked Edwards to show his friends the jewels.   The moment the door was locked inside, according to Tower custom, the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.81.2">ruffians muffled and gagged the old man</LEMMA>, and then felled him to the ground and beat him till he was nearly dead. Unluckily for the rascals, young Edwards at that moment returned from Flanders, and ran upstairs to see where his mother and sisters were.   Blood and Parrot made off at once with the globe and crown. The sceptre they could not break.   The old man freeing him. self from the gag, screamed and roused the family. Blood wounded a sentinel and fired at another, but was eventually overpowered. The crown fell in the dirt, a pearl was picked up by a sweeper, a diamond by an apprentice, and several stones were lost. Parrot was captured and the globe found in his pocket; <num value="1">one</num> fine ruby had broken loose. Hunt was thrown from his horse and taken. But none of these culprits were punished. Blood betrayed pretended plots, or in some way obtained power over the king.   He was received at court, and <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> a year was given him. 
<P>From the Jewel House we pass to the Armouries. The Armouries in the Tower were established by our earliest kings. We find Henry III. issuing a mandate to the Archdeacon of Durham to transmit to the arsenal <num value="26">twenty-six</num> suits of armour, <num value="5">five</num> iron cuirasses, <num value="1">one</num> iron collar, <num value="3">three</num> pairs of fetters, and <num value="9">nine</num> iron helmets. In <datestruct value="1339--"><year reg="1339">1339</year></datestruct> (Edward III.) John de Flete, keeper of the arms in the Tower, was commanded to bring as many <QUOTE>espringals, quarrells, hauberks, lances, arbalasts, bows and arrows,</QUOTE> as were necessary for the defence of the Castle of Southampton. <num value="2">Two</num> years afterwards the Sheriff of Gloucester was ordered to purchase and transmit to the Tower <num value="1000">1,000</num> bows, and <num value="300">300</num> sheaves of arrows; <num value="250">250</num> of the bows to be painted, the rest to be white or plain. 
<P>A curious inventory of Tower armour in the reign of Edward VI. enumerates :-- <QUOTE>Brigandines complete, having sleeves covered with crimson; ditto, with sleeves covered with cloth of gold; ditto, with sleeves covered with blue satin; millars' coats covered with fustian and white cloth; and brigandines covered with linen cloth with long taces.</QUOTE> The inventory also enumerates targets covered with steel, and having pistols in the centre; a target with <num value="20">twenty</num> pistols; a target <QUOTE>of the shell of Tortys;</QUOTE> steel horse-trappings' poleaxes with pistols at the end; gilt poleaxes, the staves covered with crimson velvet and fringed with silk of gold; holy water sprinklers, or Danish clubs, with spiked balls fastened to a chain. Some of these arms still remain in the Tower, especially a <QUOTE>holy water sprinkler with <num value="3">3</num> guns,</QUOTE> which the warders used to call <QUOTE>King Harry the <num value="8">Eighth</num>'s Walking-Staff.</QUOTE> 
<P>In the reign of Elizabeth the Tower armouries were described by Hentzner, a German traveller, in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, and our readers will see, by the following extract, that many of the chief curiosities now shown were even then on view:-- 
<P> <QUOTE>We were,</QUOTE> says Hentzner, <QUOTE>next led to the <pb id="P.82" n="82"> Armoury, in which were these peculiarities. Spears out of which you may shoot; shields that will give fire <num value="4">four</num> times; a great many rich halberds, commonly called partisans, with which the guard defend the royal person in battle; some lances covered with red and green velvet; and the suit of armour of Henry VIII.; many and very beautiful arms, as well for men as for horse-fights; the lance of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, <num value="3">three</num> spans thick; <num value="2">two</num> pieces of cannon, the <num value="1">one</num> fires <num value="3">three</num>, the other <num value="7">seven</num> balls at a time; <num value="2">two</num> others, made of wood, which the English had at the siege of Boulogne, in France, and by this stratagem, without which they could not have succeeded, they struck a terror as at the appearance of artillery, and the town was surrendered upon articles; <num value="19">nineteen</num> cannons of a thicker make than ordinary, and, in a room apart, <num value="36">thirty-six</num> of a smaller; other cannons for chain-shot and balls, proper to bring down masts of ships; cross-bows, bows and arrows, of which to this day the English make great use in their exercises. But who can relate all that is to be seen here? <num value="8">Eight</num> or <num value="9">nine</num> men, employed by the year, are scarce sufficient to keep all the arms bright.</QUOTE> 
<P>Hewitt, in his account of the Tower, argues very shrewdly, from Hentzner's silence about the spoils of the Armada still exhibited, and, in fact, about the <QUOTE>Spanish Armoury</QUOTE> altogether, that those pretended trophies were never trophies at all. The Spanish <QUOTE>coller of torment</QUOTE> is an undoubted relic of the Armada; the rest, Mr. Hewitt decides, were taken from a collection of Spanish arms, chosen for their excellent quality, and of a far earlier date than <datestruct value="1588--"><year reg="1588">1588</year></datestruct>. Hentzner visited England soon after the Armada. As a German he would be interested in all relics of the defeated Spanish invasion. He visited the Spanish Armoury, and had he been shown there any relics of Philip's armament, would be sure to have mentioned it. 
<P>The <num value="1">first</num> mention of a Spanish weapon-house is in a survey of <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, which enumerates targets with pistols, Spanish pikes; partisans, Spanish boar-spears, Spanish poleaxes, and Spanish halberts. Some later exhibitors, says Mr. Hewitt, finding a room called the Spanish Weapon-house, immediately set it down, with true showman's instinct, as a room of Armada spoils, and so the error has been perpetuated. 
<P>During the Commonwealth the Tower collection of armour lay in abeyance, but at the Restoration, William Legg, Master of the Armouries, made a survey of the stores, and in it enumerates Brandon's huge lance, the Spanish collar of torture, and the ancient head-piece with rams'-horns and spectacles still named after William   Somers, the Jester of Henry VIII. Some of the suits are noted as having come from the Green Gallery, at Greenwich. These last included both suits of Prince Henry and suits of Henry V., Henry VIII., Edward III., Edward IV., Henry VI., the Earl of Leicester, and Charles Brandon. There is also mentioned a gilt and graven suit for <QUOTE>his late majesty, of ever blessed memory, Charles I.;</QUOTE> a suit of Charles II., when a boy; and a suit sent to Charles II. by the Great Mogul. 
<P>On the Restoration, says Meyrick, the armour which had been formerly in the Green Gallery at Greenwich, placed on horseback and dignified with the name of some of our kings, gave the hint for an exhibition at the Tower of the same sort. The Tudors and Stuarts were added; and in <datestruct value="1686--"><year reg="1686">1686</year></datestruct>, the year after the death of Charles II., his figure and that of his father were added, their horses and faces carved by Grinling Gibbons. 
<P>Towards the close of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century armour fell into disuse, and was sent by various regiments to the Tower stores. A survey in <datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct> enumerates thousands of back and breast pieces, pots, and head-pieces. The equestrian figures, when fitted out from these and from various gifts, increased from <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="27">twenty-seven</num>. 
<P>Among the confused suits Meyrick found both William the Conqueror and William III. clad in plate armour of the age of Edward VI. The suit of Henry V. was composed from parts of <num value="3">three</num> others, of which the upper portion was of the time of Charles I., while the legs--which were not fellows I-were of the age of Henry VII. Henry VIII. also had the misfortune to have odd legs. George I. and George II. were armed <hi rend=italics>cap-d-pie</hi> in suits of Henry VIII.'s time, and mounted on Turkish saddles, gilt and ornamented with the globe, crescent, and star. John of Gaunt was a knight of Henry VIII.'s reign, and De Courcy a demi-lancer of Edward VI.'s. The helmet of Queen Elizabeth was of the period of Edward VI.; the armour for her arms, of that of Charles I.; her breastplate went as far back as Henry VIII.; and the <hi rend=italics>garde de reins</hi>
 of that monarch covered Her Majesty's <QUOTE>abdomen.</QUOTE> A big suit of Henry VIII., rough from the hammer, had <num value="1">first</num> been described by. the warders as <QUOTE>made for the king at the age of eighteen,</QUOTE> and then <QUOTE>as much too small for him.</QUOTE> 
<P>The absurd inventions of the Tower warders were endless. A <title>Guide to the Tower of London and its Curiosities</title> (says <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.83.1">Mr. Planche</LEMMA>), published in the reign of George III., mentions a breastplate desperately damaged by shot, which was shown as having been worn by a man, part of whose body, including some of the intestines, was carried away by a cannon-ball, notwithstanding <pb id="P.83" n="83"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.83.2">The Norman Archway</LEMMA></NOTE>
 
<NOTE RESP=B><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.83.3">Edward I. Armor</LEMMA></NOTE>
 which, being put under the care of a skilful surgeon, the man recovered, and lived for <num value="10">ten</num> years afterwards. <QUOTE>This story,</QUOTE> adds the Guide, <QUOTE>the old warder constantly told to all strangers, till H.R.H. Prince Frederick, father of the present king, being told the accustomed tale, said, with a smile,  <Q>And what, friend, is there so extraordinary in all this? I remember myself to have read in a book of a soldier who had his head cleft in <num value="2">two</num> so dextrously by the stroke of a scimitar, that <num value="1">one</num> half. of it fell on <num value="1">one</num> shoulder, and the other half of it on the other shoulder; and yet, on his comrade's clapping the <num value="2">two</num> sides nicely, together again, and binding them close with his handkerchief, the man did well, drank his pot of ale at night, and scarcely recollected that he had ever been hurt.</Q> </QUOTE> The writer goes on to say that the old warder was <QUOTE>so dashed,</QUOTE> that he never had the courage to tell his story again; but, though he might not, it was handed down by his successors, by several of whom, Mr. Planche says, he heard it repeated in his boyhood, <num value="50">fifty</num> years after the death of Frederick Prince of Wales. The old battered breastplate is still in the collection, and has not been <QUOTE>sold as old iron,</QUOTE> being thoroughly unworthy of preservation. 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1825"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct> Dr. (afterwards Sir) Samuel Rush Meyrick received the royal commands to re-arrange the Horse and Spanish Armouries, a task for which that antiquary's taste and knowledge eminently qualified him. This task he executed, but, unfortunately, was compelled by ignorant officials to appropriate every suit--(right or wrong) to some great personage of the period, distinguishing the few that could actually be identified by stars on the flags above them. The storekeeper then resumed his care, and everything went wrong: forgeries were bought and carefully preserved under glass, and valuable pieces of armour, which had been actually stolen or sold from   the armoury, were often offered for sale to the authorities and rejected by them. In <datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>, Mr. Planche, an eminent authority on armour, drew the attention of the Right Hon. Sidney Herbert to the confusion of the whole collection, and to the fact that the armoury produced an annual revenue of <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure> and odd, being, therefore, self-supporting. The same publicspirited gentleman also pointed out that the Horse Armoury admitted the rain, and had an inflammable wooden shed at <num value="1">one</num> end. In <datestruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct>, to the great satisfaction of all true antiquaries, Mr. Planche was commissioned to arrange the armour in the Tower in strict chronological order.   In his <title>Recollections and Reflections,</title> he suggests that a fine gallery could be made out of the row of carpenters' shops on the east side of the White Tower. 
<P>The negligence of the Government led, Mr. Planche says, in his own time, to many blunders. <num value="1">One</num> of the bargains missed by the Keeper of the Armouries was the complete suit in which Sir Philip Sidney was killed at the battle of Zutphen, the embossed figures on which were of. solid gold.   This national and magnificent relic was at Strawberry Hill, and is now at St. Petersburg. Another relic lost to the Tower was a heaume of the time of King John, now at Warwick Castle. A <num value="3">third</num> was the gauntlets of a fine suit made for Henry VIII., now in the Tower, imperfect from   their absence. They had found their way out of the Tower, and, on being brought back to it, were ignored and refused by the authorities, and are now at Grimston. A <num value="4">fourth</num> was a most singular quaint helmet, probably as early as the time of Stephen, if not actually the helmet of that monarch, or of his son, now in the Mus&eacute;e d&lsquo;Artillerie at Paris.   <num value="2">Two</num> other helmets, <num value="1">one</num> <abbr lang=la expan="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry III., the other of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century, with part of the crest remaining, were also rejected. At the very same time a helmet newly made at Vienna, for theatrical purposes, was purchased at the price of. <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure>, and is now in <num value="1">one</num> of the glass cases at the Tower. The only armour at, Alton Towers that could possibly have belonged to the great Talbot was suffered by some gentleman sent down by the Tower. to pass into the hands of dealers. The back-plate, a most elegant specimen, sold for <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure>, and is now in the collection of Lord Londesborough, at Grimston. 
<P>The <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.83.4">present Horse Armoury</LEMMA>, at the south-west corner of the White Tower, was completed in <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>, when Meyrick re-arranged the collection. This is a single apartment, about <num value="150">150</num> feet long by <num value="34">34</num> wide. A row of pillars supporting pointed arches runs the whole length of the interior. The space- in front of the columns is occupied by figures, some equestrian and some on foot, clothed in armour from the reign of Henry VI. to that of James II.   Several military trophies and emblems adorn the walls and ceilings of the apartment, and the space devoted to the armed figures is divided into several compartments by-stands containing weapons of the various periods. 
<P>The visitor can pass here from the simple mail of early days to the engraved and ornamented armour of Elizabeth's reign. 
<P>The Crusaders of Henry   III.'s reign brought chain-mail from the East. Mixed   plate and chain suits were introduced in the reign of Edward II. In the reign of Richard II. the visors were peaked, and projected from   the face like birds' beaks. With Henry IV. armour became all plate, and the steel monster was now fully hatched. With Henry V. came <num value="2">two</num>-handed swords, to hew to <pb id="P.84" n="84"> pieces the said armour.   In Edward IV.'s days came all sorts of novelties in armour-tuilles to cover the hips, pauldrons for the shoulders, grandegardes, or extra half-breastplates, to cover the left breast.   In the time of Richard III., say most authorities, armour attained its highest perfection of form and arrangement. The shoes have long, pointed toes.   <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.84.1">The Richard III. suit</LEMMA> at the Tower was brought from   Spain, and was worn by the Marquis of Waterford at the fantastic Eglinton Tournament. 
<P>In the reign of Henry VII. came in the beautiful German fluted armour. The helmets worn were the round Burgundian, and the shoes were round and large at the toes. The horse-armour, too is splendid. 
<FIGURE id="Fig.084" n="2000.07.0033"><HEAD>The Tower Horse Armoury.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
<P>The Henry VIII. suit, the <num value="1">first</num> suit in the collection, really belonged to the king whose effigy it covers.   The armour is damasked, and the stirrups are curious, from their great size. But <num value="1">one</num> of the finest suits in the world, and belonging to this same burly king, is in the central recess of the south wall. <QUOTE>This,</QUOTE> says Hewitt, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>is <num value="1">one</num> of, the most curious suits of armour in the world, having been made to commemorate the union of Henry VIII. and Katherine of Arragon. The badges of this king and queen, the rose and pomegranate, are engraved on various parts of the armour. On the fans of the genouilleres is the sheaf of arrows, the device adopted by Ferdinand, the father of Katherine, on his conquest of Granada.   Henry's badges, the portcullis, the fleur-de-lis, and the red dragon, also <pb id="P.85" n="85"> appear; and on the edge of the lamboys, or skirts, are the initials of the royal pair,  <Q> H. K.,</Q>  united by a true lovers' knot. The same letters, similarly united by a knot, which includes also a curious love-badge, formed of a half rose and half pomegranate, are engraved on the croupiere of the horse. 
<P>But the most remarkable part of the embellishment of this suit consists in the saintly legends which are engraved upon it. These consist of <num value="10">ten</num> subjects, full of curious costume, and indicating curious manners. 
<P>On the breastplate is the figure of St. George on foot, encountering the dragon. On the backplate appears St. Barbara, with her usual emblems. On the front of the poitrail St. George, on horseback, is dispatching the dragon; the armour of his horse is embellished with the rose and pomegranate. Also, on the poitrail, St. George accused before Diocletian; and another subject, representing some lady of rank, attended by her maids, directing the fortifications of a town or fortress. On the croupiere, St. George, stretched on the rack; a saint receiving martyrdom, by being enclosed as high as the waist in the brazen figure of an ox, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.085" n="2000.07.0034"><HEAD>The Tower Menagerie About <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 beneath which a fire is blazing, to boil the oil within; a female saint suffering decapitation; while in the background is predicted the retribution that awaits the persecutor; another saint about to suffer decapitation; St. Agatha led to be scourged; and St. Agatha being built up in prison. 
<P>Round the lower edge of the horse-armour, many times repeated, is the motto, <QUOTE lang=fr>Dieu et mon Droit,</QUOTE> while numerous other decorations-human figures, heraldic badges, arabesque   work, and grotesque devices of fabulous and other animalsare continued over the whole suit, both of man and horse. Among these engravings is <num value="1">one</num> of a female figure, bearing on the front of her bodice the German word  <QUOTE>Gluck</QUOTE>  (good luck, health, prosperity). From this, it has been suggested by Sir S. Meyrick, we may infer that the suit before us was presented by the Emperor Maximilian to Henry, in honour of his marriage with Katherine of Arragon. We own this inference seems rather a bold <num value="1">one</num>. 
<P>The armour is doubtless of German manufacture, and <num value="1">one</num> of the finest of the period.   It was formerly gilt, and when new must have had a most gorgeous appearance. From its discoloration <pb id="P.86" n="86"> by time, the elaborate decorations of its surface are almost entirely lost, but might easily be restored by a judicious renewal of the gilding. 
<P>We find another splendid suit of armour, of the reign of Edward VI. It is of the kind called 
<hi rend=italics>russet</hi>, which was produced by oxidising the metal, and then smoothing its surface. By this means the gold-work with which it was afterwards damasquined looked much richer than if inlaid on a ground of polished steel (or <hi rend=italics>white</hi> armour, as it was technically called).   The suit before us is covered with the most beautiful filagree-work. The helmet especially is most elaborately ornamented; embossed lions' heads adorn the pauldrons, elbowpieces, gauntlets, breastplate, genouilleres, and sollerets; and the whole is in the finest preservation. The helmet, which is a burgonet, is also embellished with a lion's head. In the right hand is a mace, terminating in a spear. This figure was formerly exhibited as Edward the Black Prince. 
<P>The horse-armour, which is a complete suit, is embossed and embellished with the combined badges of Burgundy and Granada.   The probabilities are that it belonged to Philip of Flanders, surnamed  <QUOTE>the Fair.</QUOTE>  He was the son of the Emperor Maximilian, by Mary, daughter and heiress of Charles the Bold, last Sovereign-Duke of Burgundy, and consequently, in right of his mother, Duke of Burgundy and Count of Flanders.   He married Joanna, <num value="2">second</num> daughter of Ferdinand and- Isabella, and sister of Katherine of Arragon, queen of. Henry VIII. 
<P>The badge of the pomegranate was borne by all the children of Isabella and Ferdinand the conqueror of Granada. Philip and Joanna, on the death of Isabella, in <datestruct value="1504--"><year reg="1504">1504</year></datestruct>, became sovereigns of Castile and Arragon, and in <num value="5006">5006</num>, on a voyage to Spain, were obliged by a violent tempest to take shelter in England, where they were detained upwards of <num value="3">three</num> months in a sort of honourable captivity by Henry VII. The armour might have been left behind, in England, on the departure of he royal travellers, or presented   by Philip to Henry.</QUOTE>
 
<P>The tilting-suit of the Earl of Leicester is still shown. <QUOTE>That the armour before us was worn by Leicester,</QUOTE> says Mr. Hewitt, <QUOTE>there is not the slightest doubt.   His initials,  <Q> R. D.,</Q>  are engraved on the genouilleres.   His cognizance of the bear and ragged staff appears on the chanfron of the horse, encircled by the collar of the Garter; and the ragged staff is repeated on every part of the suit.  <Q>The suit was originally gilt,</Q>  and  <Q>was kept,</Q>  says Sir S. Meyrick,  <Q>in the tilt-yard, where it was exhibited on particular days.</Q>  It afterwards figured in the old horse armoury as that of King James I.</QUOTE> 
<P>The suit of Sir Henry Lea, champion of Queen Elizabeth, was formerly exhibited as that of William the Conqueror.   The fine engraved and gilt suit of the Earl of Essex (<datestruct value="1581--"><year reg="1581">1581</year></datestruct>) was worn by the king's champion at the coronation of George II. The figure of James I. was formerly shown as Henry IV. The suit of Charles I. was given him by the Armourers' Company. It is richly gilt and arabesqued.   The suit is specially interesting as being the identical <num value="1">one</num> laid on the coffin of the Duke of Marlborough at his public funeral. The head of the effigy of James II. is <num value="1">one</num> carved by Grinling Gibbons as a portrait of Charles II. 
<P>The suit long called John of Gaunt's turned out to be an engraved suit for a man-at-arms of the reign of Henry VIII., and the Norman Crusader to have come from the Mogul country. There is a fine suit of Italian armour here, date <datestruct value="1620"><year reg="1620">1620</year></datestruct>, once worn by Count Oddi, of Padua. It is ornamented with the imperial eagle, the badge of his house. The devices, formed of swords, pistols, and bayonets, are very ingenious. The large pavois shield (<abbr lang=la>temp.</abbr>
 James I.) should be noticed. The russet and gold armour is Venetian, of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century; and the <num value="6">six</num> pieces of a puffed and engraved suit of the time of Henry VIII. are extremely curious and rare. The ancient German saddle of bone inlaid with figures is of uncertain date. The inscription is-

<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.87.1">The fantastic helmet with horns</LEMMA>, made  for mock tournaments, is said to have  belonged to Henry VIII.'s jester. The crossbows are of all ages.

<P>The grand storehouse for the royal train of artillery, and the small-arms armoury for <num value="150000">150,000</num> stand of arms, destroyed by fire <datestruct VALUE="1841-10-30"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=30>30</day>, <year reg=1841>1841</year></datestruct>, was built in the reign of James II. or William III., since which the Tower has been remodelled, many small dwelling-houses cleared away, and several towers and defences rebuilt. The houses of Petty Wales and the outworks have been removed, as well as the menagerie buildings near the west entrance. In the great fire of <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct> only <num value="4000">4,000</num> stand of arms were saved out of about <num value="100000">100,000</num>, and the loss was computed at about <measure value="250000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="250000">250,000</num></measure>. But for the height of the tide and the fulness of the ditch, the whole Tower would have been destroyed. In <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct> the store of arms in the Tower had amounted to <num value="600000">600,000</num>.

<P>The Train Room   contained some interesting naval relics; among others, the steering-wheel of Lord Nelson's <hi rend=italics>Victory</hi>, trophies of William III. and General Wolfe, and relics of Waterloo. The earliest guns were of the reigns of Henry VI. and Edward IV.-hooped guns, with movable chambers. There was also a great treasure which fortunately escaped the fire--a large iron chambergun, recovered from the wreck of the <hi rend=italics>Mary Rose</hi>
 (Henry VIII.). The Great Harry, which is of brass, weighs <num value="5">five</num> tons (<abbr lang=la>temp.</abbr> Henry VIII.). It has the date <datestruct value="1542"><year reg="1542">1542</year></datestruct>, and the English rose engraved upon it is surmounted by the crown of France.

<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>I sing and spring,

 <num value="1">One</num> of the finest guns preserved was a brass gun taken from the French. It had formerly belonged to the Knights of Malta. The date is <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>. It is covered with exquisite figures in alto-relievo. In <num value="1">one</num> part is a medallion portrait of the artist, Philip Lattarellus, and in another the portrait of the Grand Master   of Malta, supported by <num value="2">two</num> genii. The carriage also is very curious; its trails are formed of the intertwined figures of <num value="2">two</num> furies holding torches, and grasping a huge snake. The centre of the wheel represents the sun, the spokes forming its rays. There was also saved a small brass gun, presented to the Duke of Gloucester, the son of Queen Anne. 
<P>In other parts of the Armoury are ancient British flint axes, Saxon weapons, a suit of Greek armour, found in a tomb at Cumae ; kettle-drums from Blenheim; the cloak in which General Wolfe died; the sword-sash of that eminent but unappreciated hero, the Duke of York; Saracenic, Indian, Moorish, New Zealand, and Kaffrarian arms, and even a door-mat suit from   the South Seas.   In <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>, <num value="2000">2,000</num> stand of Russian arms, taken at Bomarsund, the <num value="1">first</num> trophies of a useless and unlucky war, were placed in the Tower.

Hatton, in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, mentions among the curiosities of the Tower the sword which Lord Kingsale took from an officer of the French body-guard, for which deed he and his posterity have the right of remaining covered in the king's presence. 
<P>From the above account it will be seen that the Tower contains as many interesting historical relics as any museum in England. Here the intelligent visitor can trace the progress of weapons from the rude flint axe of the early Briton to the latest rifle that science has invented.   Here he can see all the changes of armour, from the rude suits worn t Hastings to the time when the Italians turned the coat of steel into a work of the finest art, and lavished upon it years. of anxious and refined labour. There are breastplates in the Tower on which Montfort's spear has splintered, and cuirasses on which English swords struck fire at Waterloo. There are trophies of all our wars, from Cressy and Poictiers to Blenheim and Inkermann, spoils of the Armada, relics of the early Crusade wars, muskets that were discharged at Minden, swords of Marlborough's troopers, shields carried at Agincourt; suits of steel that Elizabeth's champions wore at Cadiz, flags that have been scorched by Napoleon's powder, blades that have shared in struggles with Dane and Indian, Spaniard and Russian.   Thanks to Mr. Planche, the Tower Armoury can now be studied in sequence, and with intellectual advantage.   The blunders of former days have been rectified, and order once more prevails, where formerly all was confusion and jumble. Thanks to the imperishability of steel, the old warcostumes of England remain for us to study, and with the smallest imagination <num value="1">one</num> can see Harry of Monmouth, in the very arms he wore, ride forth against the French spears, all blazoned   with heraldic splendour, and, shouting <QUOTE>God and St. George for merry England,</QUOTE> scatter the French, as he did when he won his crowning victory. <pb id="P.88" n="88">

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 

 
<P>The Constable of the Tower was anciently called <QUOTE>the Constable of London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>the Constable of the Sea,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>the Constable of the Honour of the Tower.</QUOTE> William I. chose as the <num value="1">first</num> Constable of his new fortress Geoffrey de Mandeville, who had fought well at Hastings.   The Constable <hi rend=italics>temp.</hi>
 Edward II. received a dole of twopence from each person going and returning by the Thames on a pilgrimage to St. James of Compostella. In the reign of Richard II. he received <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> a year, with fees from prisoners for the <QUOTE>suite of his irons</QUOTE> --for a duke, <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>; for an earl, <measure value="20bmark" type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> marks</measure>; for a baron, <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure>; for a knight, too shillings. Later, he had wine-tolls, which were taken from passing ships by his officers. Taylor the Waterpoet farmed this office, and naively confesses that he could make no profit of it till he cheated. The Constable's salary is at present about <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> a year. The Duke of Wellington was Constable from <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct> till his death, in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, and he was succeeded by that brave old veteran, Viscount Combermere. The Lieutenant of the Tower ranks next to the Constable, but the duties of his office are performed by the Deputy-Lieutenant and the Tower Major.   The warders' old dress was obtained for them by the Duke of Somerset, after his release from prison in the reign of Edward VI. 
<P>There are <num value="2">two</num> officers, says Bayley, who are now joined in the command and custody of the Tower, with the denomination of DeputyLieu- tenant and Major, both of whom are appointed by commission from the Crown, though the patronage is virtually in the Constable, who exercises the power of recommending. These officers, however, are of very modern date, having both sprung up in the course of the last century. The earliest mention we find of a Deputy-Lieutenant is in the time of Queen Anne, and that of a Major not till many years afterwards. The civil establishment of the Tower also consists of a chaplain, whose appointment is in the king exclusively; the chief porter, now called the gentleman-porter, who has his office by letters patent, at the recommendation of the Constable; a physician and a surgeon, who are appointed by his Majesty's Commission, at the recommendation of the Constable; an apothecary, who holds his place by warrant from the Constable; the gentleman-gaoler, the yeoman-porter, and <num value="40">forty</num> 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.88.3">yeoman-warders</LEMMA>, all of whom also have their places by warrant of the Constable. 
<P>Locking--up the Tower is an ancient, curious, and stately ceremony. A few minutes before the clock strikes the hour of <num value="11">eleven</num>--on Tuesdays and Fridays, <num value="12">twelve</num>--the head warder (yeoman-porter), clothed in a long red cloak, bearing a huge bunch of keys, and attended by a brother warder carrying a lantern, appears in front of the main guardhouse, and loudly calls out, <QUOTE>Escort keys!</QUOTE> The sergeant of the guard, with <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> men, then turns out and follows him to the <QUOTE>Spur,</QUOTE> or outer gate, each sentry challenging as they pass his post, <QUOTE>Who goes there?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Keys.</QUOTE> The gates being carefully locked and barred, the procession returns, the sentries exacting the same explanation, and receiving the same answer as before.   Arrived once more in front of the main guardhouse, the sentry there gives a loud stamp with his foot, and asks, <QUOTE>Who goes there?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Keys.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Whose keys?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Queen Victoria's keys.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Advance, Queen Victoria's keys, and all's well.</QUOTE> The yeomanporter then exclaims, <QUOTE>God bless Queen Victoria!</QUOTE> The main guard respond, <QUOTE>Amen!</QUOTE> The officer on duty gives the word, <QUOTE>Present arms!</QUOTE> The firelocks rattle, the officer kisses the hilt of his sword, the escort fall in among their companions, and the yeoman-porter marches across the parade alone, to deposit the keys in the Lieutenant's lodgings.   The ceremony over, not only is all egress and ingress totally precluded, but even within the walls no <num value="1">one</num> can stir without being furnished with the countersign. 
<P>The Tower has a separate coroner, and the public have access to the fortress only by sufferance. When Horwood made his survey of London, <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, he was denied admission to the Tower, and the refusal is thus recorded upon the map: <QUOTE>The Tower; the internal parts not distinguished, being refused permission to take the survey.</QUOTE> The Tower is extra-parochial; and in <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct> the population was <num value="882">882</num>, and the military in barracks <num value="606">606</num>. 
<P>Nor must we forget the now extinct menagerie in the Tower. The <num value="1">first</num> royal menagerie in England was at Woodstock, where Henry I. kept some lions and leopards to amuse his ladies and courtiers. 
<FIGURE id="fig.088facing" n="2000.07.0035"><HEAD><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.88.4">A Beefeater At The Tower</LEMMA></HEAD></FIGURE>

 Henry III. having <num value="3">three</num> leopards sent him by the Emperor Frederick II., moved his wild beasts to the Tower, and thus commenced the menagerie which existed there till <datestruct value="1814"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>. Among the national records many orders exist to the sheriffs of London, Bedfordshire, and Buckinghamshire to provide for the animals and their keepers.   Thus in <datestruct value="1252--"><year reg="1252">1252</year></datestruct> (Henry III.) the London sheriffs were. ordered to pay fourpence a day for the maintenance of a white bear, and to provide a muzzle and chain to hold him while fishing or washing himself in the river Thames. In <datestruct value="1255--"><year reg="1255">1255</year></datestruct> (same reign) they are again desired to build a house in the Tower for an elephant, sent to the king by Louis of France (the <num value="1">first</num> ever seen in England since the Roman period). In the reigns of Edward I., Edward II., and Edward III., the lions and leopards were paid for at the rate of sixpence a day, while the keepers received only <num value="3">three</num>-halfpence.   At later periods the keeper of the Tower lions was a person of quality, who received sixpence a day, and the same sum for every animal under his charge. Henry VI. gave the post to his, marshal, Robert Mansfield, and afterwards to Thomas Rookes, his dapifer. 
<P>The post was often held by the Lieutenant or Constable of the Tower, on condition of his providing a sufficient deputy. Our ancient kings had in their household an official called <QUOTE>the Master of the King's Bears and Apes.</QUOTE> In a semi-circular enclosure round the Lion Tower, James L and his court used, to come to see lions and bears baited by dogs. In Howel's time there were <num value="6">six</num> lions in the Tower, and probably no other animals. In <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, Strype enumerates <num value="11">eleven</num> lions, <num value="2">two</num> leopards or tigers (the worthy historian, it seems, knows not which), <num value="3">three</num> eagles, <num value="2">two</num> owls, <num value="2">two</num> cats of the mountain, and a jackal. In <datestruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct> Maitland gives a much larger catalogue.   By <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>, however, the Tower menagerie had sunk to a grizzly bear, an elephant, and a few birds. By the diligence of Mr. Cops, the keeper, the collection had  increased, in <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, to the following:--Bengal, lion, lioness and cubs, Cape lion, Barbary lioness, tiger, leopard, jaguar, puma, ocelot, caracal, chetah or hunting leopard, striped hyaena, hyaena dog, spotted hyaena, African bloodhound, wolf, clouded black wolf, jackal, civet or musk cat, Javanese civet, grey ichneumon, paradoxurus, brown   coati, racoon, American black bear, and grizzly bear. 
<P>A century ago, says Cunningham, the lions in the Tower were named after the reigning kings, and it was long a vulgar belief, <QUOTE>that when a king dies, the lion of that name dies after him.</QUOTE> Addison alludes to this popular error in his own inimitable way:-- <QUOTE>Our <num value="1">first</num> visit,</QUOTE> he says in the <title>Freeholder,</title>
 <QUOTE>was to the lions. My friend (the Tory Foxhunter), who had a great deal of talk with their keeper, inquired very much after their health, and whether none of them had fallen sick upon the taking of Perth and the flight of the Pretender? And hearing they were never better in their lives, I found he was extremely startled; for he had learned from his cradle that the lions in the Tower were the best judges of the title of our British kings, and always sympathised with our sovereigns.</QUOTE> 
<P>The Bengal lion   of <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>George,</QUOTE> as the keepers called him, after the reigning king, had been captured when a cub by General Watson, who shot the parents. The general made a goat foster the <num value="2">two</num> cubs during the voyage to England. They were at <num value="1">first</num> allowed to walk in the open yard, the visitors playing with them with impunity. They used to be fed once a day only, on a piece of beef <num value="6">6</num>f <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure value="9l." type=currency><num value="9">nine</num> pounds</measure> weight. The lioness was perfectly tame till she bore cubs. <num value="1">One</num> of the keepers on <num value="1">one</num> occasion finding her at large, drove her back into her den, though he was only armed with a stick, and evaded the <num value="3">three</num> springs she made at him. The menagerie declining, and the damp position and restricted room being found injurious to the animals, they were transferred to the Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park, in <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>. he refreshment room   and ticket office occupy art of the site of the Lion Tower, but the buildings were not entirely removed until <datestruct value="1853--"><year reg="1853">1853</year></datestruct>. The <QUOTE>washing the Tower lions</QUOTE> on the. <datestruct value="04-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct> used, to be an old London hoax. 
<P>The Tower Moat, long an offensive and useless nuisance, was finally drained in <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>, and then filled up and turfed as a small <hi rend=italics>campus martius</hi> for the garrison. Evergreens are planted on the banks; and. on the north-east is a shrubbery garden. 
<P>In draining the moat the workmen found several stone shot, supposed to be missiles directed at the fortress during the siege of <datestruct value="1460--"><year reg="1460">1460</year></datestruct>, when Lord Scales held the Tower for Henry VI, and the Yorkists cannonaded the fortress from a battery in Southwark. Our readers will remember <num value="2">two</num> occasions when the Tower fired on the City: <num value="1">first</num>, when the Bastard Falconbridge attacked the bridge under pretence of aiding the king; and again on Evil May Day, in the reign of Henry VIII., when the Constable of the Tower, enraged at the tumult, discharged his cannon on Cheapside way. In <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>, when there was much popular discontent, several <num value="100">hundred</num> men were employed to repair the Tower fortifications, opening the embrasures, and mounting cannon;. and on the west side of the fortress, a strong barricade was formed of old casks, filled with earth and rubble. The gates were closed at <pb id="P.90" n="90"> an early hour, and no <num value="1">one</num> but soldiers allowed upon the ramparts. In <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, when the Duke of Wellington, the Constable, filled the Tower Ditch with water, and cleansed and deepened it, the Radicals declared he was putting the fortress into order in case of the Reform agitation, as very likely he was. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.90.1">The church of St. Peter ad Vincula</LEMMA>, situated near to the north-west of the White Tower, was built, or rebuilt, by Edward III.; the private or royal chapel, in the upper part of the keep, having till then been the chief ecclesiastical building within the fortress where so many prisoners have groaned.

<P>The interesting old church has been modernised by degrees into a small mean building, with <num value="5">five</num> cinquefoil windows of late Gothic, a rude wooden porch, and a small square bell-turret at the west end. In a bird's-eye view of the Tower Liberties, made in <datestruct value="1597--"><year reg="1597">1597</year></datestruct>, the church is represented as having battlements, and <num value="2">two</num> of the <num value="5">five</num> windows are bricked up. They continued in that state till after I<num value="739">739</num>. It is supposed the old windows were destroyed by fire in the reign of Henry VIII. In the reign of Henry III. there was a small cell or hermitage for a male or female recluse behind the church, the inmate daily receiving a   penny of the king's charity.   The church now consists of a nave, chancel, and north aisle, the nave and aisle being separated by <num value="5">five</num> low pointed arches. 
<P>In this building lie many great persons whose heads paid forfeit for their ambition or their crimes. There are innocent men and women, too, among them-victims of cruelty and treachery.   Many who lie here headless suffered merely from being unfortunately too nearly allied to deposed royalty. In this little Golgotha are interred mighty secrets now never to be solved; for half the crimes of our English monarchs were wrought out on the little plot outside the church-door of St. Peter ad Vincula. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> of the earliest of the sufferers for state errors who lie in St. Peter's is Gerald Fitzgerald, Earl of Kildare and Lord Deputy of Ireland, who, committed to the Tower for treasonable practices, died there of a broken heart in <datestruct value="1534--"><year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct>.      Of the Tower prisoners already mentioned by us there here rest-Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, for vexing Henry VIII. by refusing to deny the Papal supermacy. By his own request he was buried near Sir Thomas More.   The next year the body of poor Anne Boleyn was tossed into an old arrowchest,   and   hurriedly   buried   here.   Katherine Howard, a really guilty queen, though more deserving contempt than death, came next. In the same reign another grave was filled by Cromwell, Earl of Essex, the king's deposed favourite, and Margaret, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.92.1">Countess of Salisbury</LEMMA>, mother of Cardinal Pole. The executioner chased this old countess, who refused to lay her head on the block as a traitor, round the scaffold, and killed her at last after many hasty blows. 
<P>The reign of Edward VI. brought some really evil men to the same burying-place. <num value="1">One</num> by <num value="1">one</num> they came, after days of greatness and of sorrow. <num value="1">First</num>, Thomas Lord Seymour of Dudley, the Lord Admiral, beheaded by order of his brother, the Protector Somerset; then the. bad and ambitious Protector himself. 
<P>In the reign of Mary were buried here, after execution, that poor unoffending young wife, Lady Jane, the victim of her selfish kinsman's ambition; and then the kinsman himself, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick and Duke of Northumberland. In Elizabeth's mild reign only the Earl of Essex, who so well deserved death, is to be added to the list. 
<P>In James's shameless reign the murdered Sir Thomas Overbury was interred here; and in the reign of Charles I. his victim, the great-hearted Sir John Eliot.   His son begged to be allowed to convey his father's body to Cornwall, to lie among his ancestors; but Charles, cold and unrelenting, wrote at the foot of the petition, <QUOTE>Let Sir John Eliot's body be buried in the church of that parish where he died.</QUOTE> After the Restoration, Okey, the regicide, was buried in the same place. The weak Duke of Monmouth lies beneath, the communiontable, and beneath the west gallery are the bodies of Lords Kilmarnock, Balmerino, and that wicked old fox, Simon Lovat. The Dukes of Somerset and Northumberland, Anne Boleyn, and Katherine Howard were buried before the high altar. 
<P>The monuments in the church are interesting, because the church of St. Peter escaped the Great Fire. At the west end of the north aisle is a fine enriched table-tomb, to the memory of Sir Richard Cholmondeley (that name which is such a stumbling-block to foreigners), Lieutenant of the Tower, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth (early part of Henry VIII.). The knight's recumbent effigy is in plate-armour, with collar and pendant round his neck. His hands are joined in prayer. His lady wears a pointed head-dress, and the tomb has small twisted columns at the angles, and is divided at the sides into square panels, enclosing blank shields and lozenges.   The monument formerly stood in the body of the church. In the chancel stands also a stately Elizabethan monument, to the memory of Sir Richard Blount, and Michael his son, both Lieutenants of the Tower. <QUOTE>Sir Richard, who died in <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> says Bayley, <QUOTE>is represented on <num value="1">one</num> side, in armour, with his <num value="2">two</num> sons, kneeling; and opposite his wife and <num value="2">two</num> daughters, who are shown, in the dress of the times, on the other. Sir Michael is represented in armour attended by his <num value="3">three</num> sons, his wife and daughter, all in the attitude of prayer.</QUOTE> There is also a monument in the chancel to Sir Allan Apsley, a Lieutenant of the Tower, who died in <datestruct value="1630--"><year reg="1630">1630</year></datestruct>. He was the father of that noble woman, Mrs. Lucy Hutchinson, whose <pb id="P.93" n="93"> husband was afterwards confined in the Bloody Tower. On the floor of the nave is a small and humble slab, to the memory of Talbot Edwards, gentleman, who died in <datestruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="80">eighty</num> years. This was the brave old guardian of the regalia, whom Blood and his ruffians nearly killed, and who had at last to sell his long-deferred annuity of <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure> for <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> ready money. There is also a monument to Colonel Gurwood, that brave soldier who led the storming party at Ciudad Rodrigo, who edited the <QUOTE>Wellington Despatches,</QUOTE> and who died by his own hand, from insanity produced by his wounds. Other officers of the Tower are buried here, and amongst them George Holmes, the <num value="1">first</num> Vice-President of the Society of Antiquaries, and Deputy Keeper of the Records in the Tower (died <datestruct value="1748--"><year reg="1748">1748</year></datestruct>). On the outside of the church is a monument to the memory of William Bridges, Surveyor- General of the Ordnance under Queen Anne. 
<P>The blood-stained spot where the private executions formerly took place, nearly opposite the door of St. Peter's Church, is denoted by a large oval of dark flints. Here Anne Boleyn, Lady Jane Grey, and Essex perished. It was an old slander against Raleigh that at the execution of Essex he stood at a window opposite, and puffed out tobacco in disdain of him. But in his speech at the scaffold Raleigh declared, with all the solemnity due to such a moment, <QUOTE>My lord of Essex did not see my face at the time of his death, for I had retired far off into the armoury, where I indeed saw him, and shed tears for him, but he saw not me.</QUOTE> 
<P>Archbishop Laud, in his superstitious <title>Diary,</title>
 records with fanatical horror the fact, that in the lieutenancy of Alderman Pennington, the regicide Lord Mayor of London, <num value="1">one</num> Kem, vicar of Low Leyton, in Essex, preached in this very St. Peter's in a gown over a buff coat and scarf. 
<P>In the reigns of Henry III. and Edward I. the chaplains of St. Peter's received <measure value="50s." type=currency><num value="50">50</num>s.</measure> per annum from the Exchequer. Afterwards the chaplain was turned into a rector, and given <measure value="60s." type=currency><num value="60">60</num>s.</measure> a year. In <datestruct value="1354--"><year reg="1354">1354</year></datestruct> Edward III., however, converted the chapel into a sort of collegiate church, and appointed <num value="3">three</num> chaplains to help the rector, granting them, besides the <measure value="60s." type=currency><num value="60">60</num>s.</measure>, a rent of <measure value="31s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="31">31</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> from tenements in Tower Hill and Petty Wales. Petty Wales was, an old house in Thames Street, near the Custom House, supposed to be where the Princes of Wales used to reside when they came to the City. The chaplains also received a rent of <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure> from the Hospital of St. Katherine, and certain tributes from Thames fishing-boats, together with <measure value="10bmark" type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> marks</measure> from the Exchequer, <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>s.</measure> from the Constable of the Tower, <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> from the clerk of the Mint, <measure value="13s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="13">13</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> from the Master of the Mint, and <measure value="1d." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>d.</measure> per week from the wages of each workman or teller of coins at the Mint.   The church was exempt from   episcopal authority till the time of Edward VI. 
<P>Several interesting discoveries of Roman antiquities within the Tower precincts encourage us to the belief in the old tradition that the Romans built a fortress here. In <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct>, workmen digging the foundations of a new office for the Board of Ordnance, after breaking through foundations of ancient buildings, found below the level of the present river-bed a double wedge of silver, <num value="4">four</num> inches long, and in the broadest part nearly <num value="3">three</num> inches broad. In the centre was the inscription, <foreign lang=la>Ex officina. Honorii.</foreign> This ingot is supposed to have been cast in the reign of the Emperor Honorius, A.D. <datestruct value="393"><year reg="393">393</year></datestruct>, the Roman emperor who, harassed by the Goths, in A.D. <datestruct value="410"><year reg="410">410</year></datestruct> surrendered Britain to its own people, and finally withdrew the Roman troops. The unhappy Britons, then overwhelmed by the Picts and Scots, applied for assistance to the Saxons, who soon conquered the people they had come to assist. With this silver ingot were found <num value="3">three</num> gold coins, <hi rend=italics>aurei, <num value="1">one</num></hi> of Honorius, and <num value="2">two</num> of his brother Arcadius. The coins of Arcadius were probably struck at Constantinople, the capital of the Eastern empire. On these coins (reverse) there is a soldier treading a captive under foot. In his left hand the soldier holds the labarum; in the right, a small figure of Victory. In the same spot was also found a square stone, dedicated to the manes of Titus Licinius, and a small glass crown. 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1772"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct> an elegant little open jewelled crown was found near the east side of the White Tower, leading from Cold Harbour.   It seems to have been the crown of some image, and was set with emeralds, rubies, and pearls. 
<P>The Waterloo Barracks, a large modern Gothic building, that will hold <num value="1000">1,000</num> men, used as a barrack and armoury, and loopholed for musketry, was completed in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>, on the site of the Grand Storehouse, burned down in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>. The <num value="1">first</num> stone was laid in <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct> by the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.93.1">Duke of Wellington</LEMMA>, a stone statue of whom, by Milnes, stands near the spot. North-east of the White Tower is another modern castellated range of buildings, for the officers of the garrison.   South-eastward are the Ordnance Office and storehouses. The area of the Tower within the walls is <num value="12">twelve</num> acres and <num value="5">five</num> poles, and the circuit outside the ditch is <num value="1050">1,050</num>, yards. The portcullis of the Bloody Tower is <num value="1">one</num> of the last complete relics of feudalism, being the only perfect and usable portcullis in England. 
<P>The Royal Mint had its offices in the Tower till <datestruct value="1811"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, when the present building on Tower Hill <pb id="P.94" n="94"> was completed.   Stow speaks of the Tower as a citadel to defend or command the City, a royal palace for assemblies or treaties, a state prison for dangerous offenders, the only place for coining in England in his time, an armoury for warlike provisions, the treasury of the jewels of the crown, and the storehouse of the records of the king's courts of justice at Westminster.   Many of our poets have specially mentioned the Tower.   Of these, Shakespeare stands pre-eminent.   In   the tragedy of <title>Richard III</title>. he shows us the <num value="2">two</num> princes' instinctive horror of the place in which their cruel uncle, the Crookback, wished them to spend the few days before the coronation of the young Edward : 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><sp><speaker>Prince.</speaker><L>I do not like the Tower, of any place. 
<L>Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord? 
<sp><speaker>Buck.</speaker><L>He did, my gracious lord, begin that place, 
<L>Which since succeeding ages have re-edified. 
<sp><speaker>Prince.</speaker><L>Is it upon record, or else reported 
<L>Successively from age to age, he built it? 
<sp><speaker>Buck.</speaker><L>Upon record, my gracious lord.</QUOTE>
 
<P>And in another passage, in <title>Richard II.</title>, the poet seems to hint at a similar association:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>This is the way 
<L>To Julius Caesar's ill-erected Tower.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Gray, in his <title>Bard,</title> speaks of- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Ye towers of Julius, London's lasting shame, 
<L>With many a foul and midnight murder fed.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Before tearing ourselves from the Tower, we may mention a few nooks and corners of interest not generally known to visitors. In the northeastern turret of the White Tower was the observatory of that great astronomical rival of Newton, 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.94.1">John Flamstead</LEMMA>.   Here often he <QUOTE>outwatched the bear.</QUOTE> The   Ordnance Office gave him   <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> a year. The roof of this tower was a promenade for prisoners. In <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct> there were <num value="3000">3,000</num> barrels of gunpowder stored close to the White Tower. The Record Tower, or Hall Tower, was formerly called the Wakefield Tower, from the Yorkist prisoners confined there after that great battle of the Roses. 
<P>The most terrible cells of the fortress, such as those over which Mr. Harrison Ainsworth threw a blue fire, are in the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.94.2">Bowyer Tower</LEMMA>, where there is a ghastly hole with a trap-door, opening upon a flight of steps.   In the lower chambers of the Devereux Tower are subterranean passages, leading to St. Peter's Church. In the Beauchamp Tower a secret passage has been discovered in the masonry, where spies could cower, and listen to the conversations and soliloquies of poor unsuspecting prisoners.   <num value="1">One</num> torture-chamber was called, says Mr. Hewitt, <QUOTE>Little Ease,</QUOTE> because it was so small that a prisoner could not stand erect, or even lie down at full length. Other cells are said to have been full of rats, which at high water were driven up in shoals from the Thames. Hatton, in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, describes the Tower guns as <num value="62">sixty-two</num> in number; they were on the wharf, and were discharged on all occasions of victories, coronations, festival days, days of thanksgiving, and triumphs. They are now fired from a salutation-battery facing Tower Hill. The prisoner's walks in the Tower, spots of many a mournful hour of regret and contemplation, are specially interesting. There is <num value="1">one</num>--a passage on the leads between the (alarm) Bell Tower and the Beauchamp Tower. The walls are carved with names. In the Garden Tower are also leads where prisoners used to pace; and Pepys, visiting the Tower, <datestruct VALUE="1669-03-11"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=11>11</day>, <year reg=1669>1669</year></datestruct>, in order to see Sir W. Coventry, they visit what was then called <QUOTE>My Lord of Northumberland's Walk ;</QUOTE> at the end of it there was a piece of iron upon the wall with his arms upon it, and holes to put in a peg for every turn made upon the walk. Mrs. Hutchinson especially mentions that her husband was confined in the room of the Bloody Tower where it was said the <num value="2">two</num> princes were murdered. The room that led to it was that in which, it is popularly believed, the Duke of Clarence was drowned. <QUOTE>It was a dark, great room,</QUOTE> says the amiable and faithful wife, <QUOTE>with no window in it, and the portcullis of a gate was drawn up within it, and below there sat every night a court of guard.</QUOTE> 
<P>The council-chamber of the Lieutenant's lodgings, where Guy Fawkes was examined, and perhaps tortured, is said to be haunted, and the soldiers of the Tower have a firm belief that a ghost, in some ambiguous and never clearly-defined shape, appeared on <num value="1">one</num> occasion to a drunken sentry near the Martin Tower, the old Jewel House.   It is said that upwards of <num value="1000">1,000</num> prisoners have been groaning together at <num value="1">one</num> time in the Tower. The person who believes in the Tower ghost can swallow this too. Bayley mentions that the bones of an old ape, which had hidden itself and died in an unoccupied turret, were set down in his time as those of the <num value="2">two</num> murdered princes. 
<P>During the Spa Fields riot some of the rioters, including Thistlewood, afterwards the desperate leader of the Cato Street conspirators, came to the Tower walls and tried to persuade the soldiers to join them, offering them <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> each, but failed to win over even a single recruit. A few years ago the population of the Tower, including the garrison, was <num value="1488">1,488</num>. 
<P>In old times, says Mr. Dixon, in his book on <pb id="P.95" n="95"> London Prisons, whenever it was found necessary to carry a prisoner through the streets, the sheriffs received him from the king's lieutenants at the entrance to the City, gave a receipt for him, and took another on delivering him up at the gates of the Tower. The receipt of the Governor of the Tower for the body of the Duke of Monmouthhis living body--is still extant.

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 
<P>Of Tower Hill, that historical and blood-stained ground to the n<num value="6">6</num>rth-west of the Tower, old Stow says:-- <QUOTE>Tower Hill, sometime a large plot of ground, now greatly straitened by encroachments (unlawfully made and suffered) for gardens and houses. Upon this hill is always readily prepared, at the charges of the City, a large scaffold and gallows of timber, for the execution of such traitors or transgressors as are delivered out of the Tower, or otherwise, to the Sheriffs of London, by writ, there to be executed.</QUOTE> 
<P>Hatton, in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct> (Queen Anne) mentions Tower Hill as <QUOTE>a spacious place extending round the west and north parts of the Tower, where there are many good new buildings, mostly inhabited by gentry and merchants.</QUOTE> The tide of fashion and wealth had not yet set iii strongly westward. An old plan of the Tower in <datestruct value="1563--"><year reg="1563">1563</year></datestruct> shows us the posts of the scaffold for state criminals, a good deal north of Towel Street and a little northward of Legge Mount, the great north-west corner of the Tower fortifications. In the reign of Edward IV. the scaffold was erected at the charge of the king's officers, and many controversies arose at various times, about the respective boundaries, between the City and the Lieutenant of the Tower. 
<P>On the Tower Hill scaffold perished, nearly all the prisoners whose wrongs and sorrows and crimes we have glanced at in a previous chapter the great Sir Thomas More, the wise servant of a corrupt king; the unhappy old Countess of Salisbury, who was chopped down here as she ran bleeding round the scaffold; Bishop Fisher, a staunch adherent to the old faith; that great subverter of the monks, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.95.2">Cromwell.Earl of Essex</LEMMA>; and the poet Earl of Surrey-all victims of the same bad monarch. 
<P>Then in the reigns of Edward VI. and Mary, in ghastly procession after the masked headsman paced Lord Seymour; in due course followed the brother who put him to death, the proud Pro tector Somerset; then that poor weak young noble, Lady Jane Grey's husband, Lord Guildford Dudley; and <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.95.3">Sir Thomas Wyat</LEMMA>, the rash objector to a Spanish marriage. 
<P>The victims of Charles's folly followed in due time--the dark and arrogant Strafford, who came like a crowned conqueror to his death; then his sworn ally, the narrow-browed, fanatical Laud. The Restoration Cavaliers took their vengeance next, and to Tower Hill passed those true patriots, Stafford, insisting on his innocence to the very last, and Algernon Sydney.   The unlucky Duke of Monmouth was the next to lay his misguided head on the block. 
<P>Blood ceased to flow on Tower Hill after this execution till the Pretender's fruitless rebellions of <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct> brought Derwentwater, <QUOTE>the pride of the North,</QUOTE> Kilmarnock, Balmerino, and wily old Lovat to the same ghastly bourne. In <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct> Mr. Radcliffe (Lord Derwentwater's brother) was executed here. He had been a prisoner in the Tower for his share in the rebellion of <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct>, but succeeded in escaping. He was identified by the barber, who <num value="31">thirty-one</num> years before had shaved him when in prison. 
<P>Chamberlain Clarke; who died in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="92">ninety-two</num> (a worthy old City authority, who has been mentioned by us in a previous chapter), well remembered (says Mr. Timbs), as a child, seeing the executioner's axe flash in the sunshine as it fell upon the neck of Mr. Radcliffe. At the last execution which took place on Tower Hill, that of Lord Lovat, <datestruct VALUE="1747-04-9"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=9>9</day>, <year reg=1747>1747</year></datestruct>, a scaffolding, built near Barking Alley, fell, with nearly <num value="1000">1,000</num> persons on it, and <num value="12">twelve</num> of them   were killed. Lovat, in spite of his awful situation, seemed to enjoy the downfall of so many Whigs. 
<P>There is a passage in <title>Henry VIII.</title>--a play considered by many persons to be not Shakespeare's. writing at all, and by some others only partly his work--that has much puzzled those wise persons, 
<NOTE RESP=B><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.95.4">More led to execution</LEMMA></NOTE>
 <pb id="P.96" n="96"> the commentators. The author of the play, which is certainly not quite in the best Shakespearian manner, makes a door-porter say, talking of a mob, <QUOTE>These are the youths that thunder at a play-house and fight for bitten apples: that no audience but the tribulation of Tower Hill or the limbs of Limehouse are able to endure.</QUOTE> This passage seems to imply that there were low theatres in Shakespeare's time near Tower Hill and Limehouse, or did he refer to the crowd at a Tower Hill execution, and to the mob of sailors at the <num value="2">second</num> locality? 
<P>A curious old custom is still perpetuated in this neighbourhood.   The <QUOTE>bounds</QUOTE> of the Tower Liberties are perambulated triennially, when, after service in the church of St. Peter, a procession is 
<FIGURE id="Fig.096" n="2000.07.0038"><HEAD>Lord Lovat. (From Hogarth's Portrait.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 formed upon the parade, including a headsman, bearing the axe of execution; a painter, to mark the bounds; yeomen, warders, with halberds; the Deputy Lieutenant and other officers of the Tower, &amp;c.   The boundary-stations are painted with a red <QUOTE>broad arrow</QUOTE> upon a white ground, while the chaplain of St. Peter's repeats, <QUOTE>Cursed be he who removeth his neighbour's landmark.</QUOTE> Another old custom of lighting a bonfire on Tower Hill, on the <datestruct value="11-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, was suppressed in the year <datestruct value="1854"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>. 
<P>The traditions of Tower Hill, apart from the crimson block and the glittering axe, are few, but what there are, are interesting. Poor suffering Lady Raleigh, when   driven from   the side of her imprisoned husband, as James began to drive him <pb id="P.97" n="97"> faster towards death, lodged on Tower Hill with her son who had been born in the Tower. 
<P>William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, was born on Tower Hill, <datestruct VALUE="1644-10-14"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=14>14</day>, <year reg=1644>1644</year></datestruct>.

<P>That tender-hearted poet, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.98.1">Thomas Otway</LEMMA>, the friend of Shadwell-whose poverty and wretchedness Rochester cruelly sneered at in his <QUOTE>Session of the Poets,</QUOTE> and whose nature and pathos Dryden praised, though somewhat reluctantly-died, as it is generally thought, of starvation, at the <QUOTE>Bull</QUOTE> public-house on Tower Hill.   He was only thirtyfour when he died. The stories of his untimely death differ. Dr. Johnson's version is that, being naked and in a rage of hunger, he went to a neighbouring coffee-house, and asked a gentleman for a <pb id="P.98" n="98"> shilling.   The gentleman generously gave the starving poet a guinea, on which Otway rushed into the nearest baker's, bought a roll, and, eating with ravenous haste, was choked with the <num value="1">first</num> mouthful.   But Spence was told by Dennis, the well-known critic, and the great enemy of Pope, that an intimate friend of Otway's, being shot by an assassin, who escaped to Dover, <hi rend=italics>en route</hi> for France, Otway pursued him. In the excitement he drank cold water, and brought on a fever, which carried him off. Goldsmith, in the <QUOTE>Bee,</QUOTE> tells a story of Otway having about him when he died a copy of a tragedy which he had sold to Bentley the bookseller for a mere trifle. It was never recovered, but in <datestruct value="1719--"><year reg="1719">1719</year></datestruct> a spurious forgery of it appeared. 
<P>It was at a cutler's shop on Tower Hill that Felton, that grim fanatic, who believed himself an instrument of Heaven, bought the broad, sharp, tenpenny hunting-knife with which he gave the heavy and sure blow at Portsmouth,   that ended the ambition and plots of the <num value="1">first</num> Duke of Buckingham, the mischievous favourite of Charles I. 
<P>That admirable antiquarian artist, Smith, has engraved a view of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.98.2">a curious old house on Tower Hill</LEMMA> enriched with medallions evidently of the time of Henry VIII. (probably terra cotta), like those, says Peter Cunningham, at old Whitehall and Hampton Court. It was not unusual, when coins were found upon a particular spot whereon a house was to be erected, to cause such coins to be represented in plaster on the house. A reproduction of this engraving will be found on the previous page. 
<P>In Postern Row, the site of the old postern gate at the south-eastern end of the City wall, used, says Timbs, to be the old rendezvous for enlisting soldiers and sailors, and for arranging the iniquitous press-gangs to scour Wapping and Ratcliff Highway.   The shops here are hung with waterproof coats, sou&lsquo;--westers, and other articles of dress; and the windows are full of revolvers,. quadrants, compasses, ship's biscuits, &amp;c., to attract sailors. 
<P>At the south-west corner of Tower Hill is Tower Docks, where luckless Sir Walter Raleigh, in disguise, after his escape from the Tower in <datestruct value="1618--"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct>, took boat for Tilbury. That most poetical of all our poets, Edmund Spenser, was born near Tower Hill, in <datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>. Very little is known of his parentage, but though poor, it must have been respectable, as he was sent at <num value="16">sixteen</num> to Pembroke College, Cambridge, as a humble student or sizar. He dedicated <num value="1">one</num> of his early poems to Sir Philip Sidney, that star of Elizabethan knighthood, and began his career by going td Ireland (a country whose wild people he often sketches in his <title>Fairy Queen</title>), as secretary to Lord: Grey of Wilton, the viceroy. He is said to have there commenced his <title>Fairy Queen</title> urged on by Sir Walter Raleigh. He seems to have spent about <num value="17">seventeen</num> years in that Patmos,: and returned to. London poor and heart-broken, having had his castle burnt down, and his infant child destroyed in the fire. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, at the expense of the Earl of Essex.   The poems of   <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.98.3">Spenser</LEMMA> furnished many suggestions to Shakespeare, who probably derived from them the story of <title>King Lear</title>, and some of the most beautiful of his heroine's names. Spenser himself drew his inspiration from the Italian poets. 
<P>The <num value="2">second</num> Duke of Buckingham used often to visit in disguise, in his days of political intrigue, a poor astrologer, who drew horoscopes, near Tower Hill. Science was then making great advances, thanks to the inductive system introduced by Bacon; but even Newton practised alchemy, and witches were still burnt to death. 
<P>The parishes and liberties now called the Tower Hamlets, and since <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct> returning <num value="2">two</num> members to the House of Commons, included Hackney, Norton Folgate, Shoreditch, Spitalfields, Whitechapel, East Smithfield, St. Katherine's, Wapping, Ratcliff, Shadwell, Limehouse, Poplar, Blackwall, Bromley, Old Ford, Mile-End, Bethnal Green, &amp;c. An alteration was effected by the Reform Bill of <datestruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct>, when Hackney was made a separate electoral district, returning <num value="2">two</num> members to Parliament. 
<P>Great Tower Street has not many traditions to boast of, though sailors and Tower warders have haunted it for centuries. Its <num value="2">two</num> main antiquarian heroes are the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.98.4">Earl of Rochester</LEMMA>and that noble savage, Peter the Great. <num value="1">One</num> of this mad earl's maddest freaks brought him   to Tower Street. While in disgrace at court, we believe for his bitter satire on Charles II., called the <title>History of the Insipids,</title> he robed and bearded himself as an Italian quack or mountebank physician, and under the name of Alexander Bendo, set up at a goldsmith's house, next door to the <QUOTE>Black Swan,</QUOTE> in Tower Street, where he advertised that he was sure to be seen <QUOTE>from <num value="3">three</num> of the clock in the afternoon till <num value="8">eight</num> at night.</QUOTE> His biographer, Bishop Burnet, mentions this; and it is said that the earl surprised his patients by the knowledge of court secrets he displayed. 
<P>The <num value="2">second</num> story of Great Tower Street relates to the true founder of the Russian Empire. This extraordinary man, whose strong shoulder helped his country out of the slough of ignorance and obscurity, was born in <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>, and visited Holland in <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>, to learn the art of shipbuilding, having <pb id="P.99" n="99"> resolved to establish a Russian navy. Having worked among the Dutch as a common labourer, he finally came to England for <num value="4">four</num> months, to visit our dockyards and perfect himself in ship-building. While in England he lived alternately in Buckingham Street, Strand (bottom house on the left-hand side), and Evelyn's house at Deptford. After a hard day's work with adze and saw, the young Czar, who drank like a boatswain, used to resort to a public-house in Great Tower Street, and smoke and drink ale and brandy, almost enough to float the vessel he had been helping to construct. <QUOTE>The landlord,</QUOTE> says Barrow, Peter's biographer, <QUOTE>had the Czar of Muscovy's head painted and put up for his sign, which continued till the year <datestruct value="1808"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>, when a person of the name of Waxel took a fancy to the old sign, and offered the then occupier of the house to paint him a new <num value="1">one</num> for it. A copy was accordingly made from the original, which maintains its station to the present day as the sign of the  <Q>Czar of Muscovy.</Q>  The house has since been rebuilt, and the sign removed, but the name remains. Peter was recalled from his pitchpots and adzes by the news of an insurrection in Russia, headed by his sister. A year after, he declared war on that  <Q>madman of the North,</Q>  Charles XII. of Sweden.</QUOTE> 
<P>Bakers' Hall hides itself with humility in Harp Lane, Great Tower Street.   The <QUOTE>neat, plain building,</QUOTE> as Mr. Peter Cunningham calls it, repaired by Mr. James Elmes, the author of the 
<title>Life of Wren,</title> was (says Stow) some time the dwelling-house of Alderman Chichley, Chamberlain of London, who was descended from the celebrated Chichley, Archbishop of Canterbury, ambassador from Henry IV. to the Pope. He accompanied Henry V. to the French war. His life was spent in a <num value="2">two</num>-handed warfare-against the Pope and against the Wickliffites. This generous prelate improved Canterbury Cathedral and Lambeth Palace, and founded All Souls' College at Oxford. The London bakers were originally divided into <QUOTE>white</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>brown</QUOTE> bakers. The chief supply of bread (says Strype) came from Stratford-le-Bow. By a somewhat tyrannical edict of the City, the Stratford loaves were required to be heavier in weight than the London loaves. 
<P>In the uncongenial atmosphere of Little Tower Street, that fat, lazy, and good-natured poet, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.99.1">James Thomson</LEMMA>, wrote his fine poem   of <title>Summer,</title>
 published in <datestruct value="1727--"><year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct>. In a letter to Aaron Hill, dated <datestruct VALUE="1726-05-24"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=24>24</day>, <year reg=1726>1726</year></datestruct>, he says, <QUOTE>I go on Saturday next to reside at Mr. Watts's academy, in Little Tower Street, in quality of tutor to a young gentleman there.</QUOTE> Thomson was the son of a Roxburghshire clergyman, and was educated for the Church --a profession which, however, he never entered. He came to London in <datestruct value="1725--"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>, and published his 
<title>Winter;</title> a poem   whose broadly-painted landscapes remind us of those of Wilson and contemporaneous painters, just as Byron's poems remind us of Turner. In <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct> Thomson went abroad, as travelling tutor with the son of Lord Chancellor Talbot.   There was no return to dingy Little Tower Street for the epicurean poet, who soon after obtained some Government sinecures, among others the post of Surveyor-General to the Leeward Islands, and became patronised by the Prince of Wales. Thomson's poem of the <title>Seasons</title> did much to foster our national love of Nature, but the poet's <hi rend=italics>chef-d'oeuvre</hi> is, after all, his <title>Castle of Indolence,</title> a poem full of the poet's idiosyncrasy. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> of the strangest corruptions of the names of London streets occurs in the Tower precincts. A place once called <QUOTE>Hangman's Gains,</QUOTE> as if built with the fees of some Tower executioner, should really have been <QUOTE>Ham and Guienne,</QUOTE> for here (says Strype) poor refugees from <QUOTE>Hammes and Guynes</QUOTE> were allowed to lodge in Queen Mary's reign, after Calais and its vicinity had been recovered from our strong grip by the French. 
<P>Seething Lane, Tower Street, running northward to Crutched Friars, was originally (says Stow) called Sidon Lane, and in his time there were fair and large houses there. The old chronicler of London mentions among the distinguished residents the wily Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's principal secretary.   This great counter-plotter against the Jesuits in Spain died <datestruct VALUE="1590-04-5"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=5>5</day>, <year reg=1590>1590</year></datestruct>, and the next night, at <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock, was quietly buried in Paul's Church.   Walsingham's name occurs perpetually in Elizabethan annals, and no <num value="1">one</num> by darker or more secret means fought better for Elizabeth against the dangerous artifices of Mary Queen of Scots, whose ways were dark indeed. 
<P>The garrulous, gallant, and inimitable Pepys was living in this lane, to be near his work at the Navy Office adjoining, the very year the Great Fire broke out. He describes putting his head out of window at the <num value="1">first</num> alarm, and going quietly to sleep again, on the <datestruct value="09-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, about <num value="2">two</num> of the morning, when his handsome wife called him up and told him of new cries of fire, it being come to Barking Church (Allhallows, Barking), <QUOTE>which is at the bottom of our lane.</QUOTE> In Strype's time Seething Lane had become <QUOTE>a place of no great account,</QUOTE> but there were still merchants living there. 
<P>The old Navy Office in Seething or Sidon Lane had the chief entrance in Crutched Friars, and the smaller <num value="1">one</num> in the lane. It stood (says <pb id="P.100" n="100"> Cunningham) on the site of a chapel and college attached to the church of Allhallows, Barking, which had been suppressed and pulled down in the year <datestruct value="1548"><year reg="1548">1548</year></datestruct> (Edward VI.). The consecrated ground remained a garden-plot during the troubles of Edward's reign, the rebellions of Mary's reign, and the glorious days of Elizabeth, till at length Sir William Winter, surveyor of Elizabeth's ships, built on it a great timber and brick storehouse for merchants' goods, which grew into a Navy Office. Cunningham found among the Audit Office enrolments an entry that in <datestruct VALUE="1788-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>, the purchasemoney of the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.100.1">old Navy Office,</LEMMA>, <measure value="11500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="11500">11,500</num></measure>,   was handed over to Sir William Chambers, the architect of the Government offices in the new Somerset House.

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 
<P>That the Romans had a mint in London is certain, and probably on the site of the present Tower. In the Saxon times London and Winchester were the chief places for coining money; but while the <QUOTE>White City,</QUOTE> as Winchester was called, had only <num value="6">six</num> <QUOTE>moneyers,</QUOTE> or minters, London boasted <num value="8">eight</num>. The chief mint of England was in the Tower, at all events from the Conquest till <datestruct value="1811"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, when, at an outlay of more than a quarter of a million of money, Sir Robert Smirke erected the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.100.2">present quiet and grave building</LEMMA> which stands on the east side of Tower Hill. From those portals has since flowed forth that rich Niagara of gold which English wealth has yielded to the ceaseless cravings of national expenditure. 
<P>Letting alone the old Celtic ring-money of the ancient Britons, and the rude Roman-British coins of Cunobelin and Boadicea, we may commence a brief notice of English coinage with the silver penny mentioned in the laws of Ina, king of the West Saxons (<num value="689">689</num>-<num value="726">726</num>), the value of which, says Mr. J. Saunders, would be, in current coin, <measure value="2.75d." type=currency><num value="2.75">2 3/4</num>d.</measure> The silver penny of King Alfred is the earliest authentic Saxon coin, says that eminent authority, Mr. Ruding, which can be traced with certainty to the London Mint.   The penny sank by slow degrees, through the reigns of many adulterating monarchs, from the weight of <num value="22.50">22 1/2</num> grains to about <num value="7">7</num> grains.   The great object of our monarchs seems to have been to depreciate as far as possible the real value of the coin, and at the same time to keep up its current value. We find, in fact, even such a great and chivalrous king as Edward III. shamelessly trying to give false weight, and busy in passing spurious money. 
<P>With this perpetual tampering with the coin, which pretended to a value it never possessed, clippers and coiners of course abounded. They were given to the crows by hundreds, while the royal forgers escaped scot-free.   Justice, so called, like a spider, let the wasps escape, but was down swift upon the smaller fry. Law was red-handed in the Middle Ages, and swift and terrible in its revenges on the poor and the unprivileged.   In the reign of Edgar, the penny having lost half its weight,   <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.100.3">St. Dunstan</LEMMA>   (himself an amateur goldsmith) refused <num value="1">one</num> Whitsun-day to celebrate mass till <num value="3">three</num> of the unjust moneyers had had their guilty right hands struck off. 
<P>In the reign of Henry I., when the dealers refused to take the current money in the public markets, the hot-tempered monarch sent over a swift and angry message from Normandy, to summon all the moneyers of England to appear at Winchester against Christmas Day.   <num value="3">Three</num> honest men alone, out of <num value="94">ninety-four</num> of the minters, escaped mutilation and banishment. In <datestruct value="1212--"><year reg="1212">1212</year></datestruct>, when Pandulph, the Pope's legate, excommunicated King John at Northampton, the king, who was making quick work with a batch of prisoners (being, no doubt, not in the best of tempers), ordered a priest, who had coined base money, to be immediately hung. Pandulph at once threatened with <QUOTE>bell, book, and candle</QUOTE> any <num value="1">one</num> who should dare touch the Lord's anointed; and on King John at last surrendering the priest, the legate at once set the holy rogue free, in contempt of the royal laws. As for the Jews, who had always an <QUOTE>itching palm</QUOTE> for gold and silver, and filed and <QUOTE>sweated</QUOTE> every bezant they could rake together, Edward I., in an irresistible outburst of business-like indignation and religious zeal, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion hung a batch of <num value="280">280</num> <pb id="P.101" n="101"> of them. But the prudent king did more than this, for he confirmed the privileges of the Moneyers' Company, and entrusted them with the whole coinage of the country. In the following reign a Comptroller of the Mint was appointed, who was to send in his accounts distinct from those of the Warden and Master. The Company consisted of <num value="7">seven</num> senior and junior members, and a provost, who undertook the whole coinage at fixed charges. 
<P>With Henry III. English money, says a good authority, began to improve in appearance, and to exhibit more variety. The gold penny of this monarch passed current for <measure value="20d." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pence</measure>. This was the <num value="1">first</num> English gold coinage. In the reign of Edward I. silver halfpennies and farthings were for the <num value="1">first</num> time made round, instead of square. About this coinage there is the following story. An old prophecy of Merlin had declared that whenever English money should become round, a Welsh prince would be crowned in London. When Llewellyn, the last Welsh prince, was slain by Edward, his head, probably in ridicule of this prophecy, was crowned with willows and sent to the Tower for exhibition. 
<P>Edward III. (as national wealth increased national wants) introduced several fresh coins: a gold florin, with its divisions, a gold noble, a groat, and a half-groat. The gold florin, which passed for <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">six</num> shillings</measure> (now worth <num value="19">nineteen</num>), soon gave place, says Saunders, to the gold noble or rose-noble, as it was sometimes called, of the value of <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure>, or half a mark. On <num value="1">one</num> side of this coin Edward stands in a tall turreted galley in complete armour, in reference probably to his great naval victory over the French at Sluys, when he made an end of nearly <num value="15000">15,000</num> of the enemy. The reverse bears a cross fleury, and the mysterious legend, <QUOTE lang=la>Jesus autem transiens per medium illorum ibat</QUOTE> (Jesus, however, passing over, went through the midst of them); an inscription which was traditionally supposed to allude to the fact of the gold used for the coin having been made by the famous alchemist Lully, who worked for that purpose in the Tower. In the reign of Henry VI. the rose-noble was called the rial, and promoted to the value of <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> 
<P>The silver groat, says an authority on coins, derived its name from the French word <hi rend=italics>gros</hi>, as being the largest silver coin then known. 
<P>Of the silver groats of Henry V.'s reign, Leake, in his <title>History of English Money,</title> relates a curious anecdote from Speed. The coin has on <num value="1">one</num> side a cross (so that the coin could be broken into <num value="4">four</num> bits), and on the other a head of the young king, the crown set with <num value="3">three</num> fleurs-de-lis, and the hair flowing as Absalom's. On each side of the niche are <num value="2">two</num> small circlets, said to be intended for eyelet holes, and to refer to the following story. Towards the close of his reign Henry IV. grew shaken in his mind, and alarmed at his son's loose and unworthy excesses with the Falstaffs of those days, began to fear some violence from his abandoned and undutiful son, <QUOTE>which when,</QUOTE> says Speed, <QUOTE>Prince Henry heard of by some that favoured him of the King's Council, in a strange disguise he repaired to his court, accompanied with many lords and noblemen's sons. His garment was a gown of blue satin, wrought full of eyelet holes, and at every eyelet the needle left hanging by the silk it was wrought with.   About his arm he wore a dog's collar, set full of SS of gold, the tirets thereof being most fine gold. Thus coming to Westminster and the court of his father, having commanded his followers to advance no farther than the fire in the hall, himself, accompanied with some of the king's household, passed on to his presence, and after his duty and obeisance done, offered to make known the cause of his coming. The king, weak then with sickness, and supposing the worst, commanded himself to be borne into a withdrawing chamber, some of his lords attending upon him, before whose feet Prince Henry fell, and with all reverent obeisance spake to him as followeth:  <Q> Most gracious sovereign and renowned father, the suspicion of disloyalty and divulged reports of my dangerous intendments towards your royal person and crown hath enforced at this time and in this manner to present myself and life at your Majesty's dispose. Some faults and misspent time (with blushes I may speak it) my youth hath committed, yet those made much more by such fleering pick-thanks that blow them stronger into your unwilling and distasteful ears. The name of sovereign ties allegiance to all; but of a father, to a further feeling of nature's obedience; so that my sins were double if such suggestions possessed my heart; for the law of God ordaineth that he which doth presumptuously against the ruler of his people shall. not live; and the child that smiteth his father shall die the death. So far, therefore, am I from <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.102.1">any disloyal attempts against the person of you, my father</LEMMA>, and the Lord s anointed, that if I knew any of whom you stood in the least danger or fear, my hand, according to duty, should be the <num value="1">first</num> to free your suspicion. Yea, I will most gladly suffer death to ease your perplexed heart; and to that end I have this day prepared myself, both by confession of my offences past and receiving the blessed sacrament.   Wherefore I humbly beseech your grace to free your suspicion from all fear conceived against me with this dagger, the stab <pb id="P.102" n="102"> whereof I will willingly receive here at your Majesty's hand; and so doing, in the presence of these lords, and before God at the day of judgment, I clearly forgive my death.</Q>  But the king, melting into tears, cast down the naked dagger (which the prince delivered him), and raising his prostrate son, embraced and kissed him, confessing his ears to have been over-credulous that way, and promising never to open them against him. But the prince, unsatisfied, instantly desired that at least his accusers might be produced, and, if convicted, to receive punishment, though not to the full of their demerits.; to which request the king replied that, as the offence was capital, so should it be examined by the peers, and therefore willed him to rest contented until the next Parliament. Thus by his great wisdom he satisfied his father from further suspicion, and recovered his love that nearly was lost.</QUOTE> 
<P>The gold angel (with St. Michael striking the dragon) and the half-angel were <num value="1">first</num> struck by Edward IV., and although inferior in value to the noble and half-noble, were intended to pass in their room. Henry VII. originated many new coins-the

 sovereign, double sovereign, and half-sovereign, of gold, and the testoon, or shilling, of silver. The Saxons had used the word <QUOTE>shilling,</QUOTE> but it now <num value="1">first</num> became a current coin. The testoon borrowed its name from the French word, <hi rend=italics>teste</hi>, <QUOTE>a head,</QUOTE> the royal portrait, for the <num value="1">first</num> time presented in profile. 
<P>Henry VIII., to his affectionate character as a husband, and his other virtues, pointed out so ably by Mr. Froude, added to them all the merit of being pre-eminent even among English monarchs for debasing the coinage. Some of the earlier coins of this reign bear the portrait of Henry VII. <num value="1">One</num> coin struck by Henry VIII. was the George noble, so called from the effigy of St. George and the Dragon, well known to all lovers of their sovereign, stamped on the reverse. Henry VIII. also coined a silver crown-piece, which was, however, issued by his son Edward, with the half-crown, sixpence, and threepence. In Edward's reign the debasement of coin grew more shameless than ever. There were now only <num value="3">three</num> ounces of silver left in the pound of coinage metal. In <num value="1">one</num> of his plain-spoken Saxon sermons, old Latimer denounced the custom   of having ecclesiastics among the comptrollers of the <pb id="P.103" n="103"> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.103" n="2000.07.0041"><HEAD>Interior Of The Mint (From A Drawing Of About <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>

<P>Elizabeth, in these things as in most others, listened to wise counsellors.   Sir Thomas Gresham was earnest for a pure and honest coinage.   The silver was restored to the fair standard-eighteen pennyworths of alloy in the   pound of standard metal.   The corrupt coin of her father and brother was called in, and ordered to be melted down for re-casting.   The sum   thus treated amounted to <measure value="244000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="244000">244,000</num></measure>, which had hitherto passed current for <measure value="638000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="638000">638,000</num></measure>.   The queen herself came to the Tower, struck some pieces with her own hand, and gave them to her suite.   The <num value="1">first</num> milled money (the <QUOTE>mill-sixpences</QUOTE> mentioned by Shakespeare) was coined in this reign, and silver <num value="3">three</num>-halfpenny and <num value="3">three</num>-farthing pieces were also coined <hi rend=italics>(vide</hi> our previous account of Tokenhouse Yard) in deference to the national dislike of copper money. 
<P>The robbery by Charles I. of <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure>   from the Mint, where it had been deposited for safety by the London   merchants, we have before mentioned. Charles coined money suddenly from any Cavalier's plate he could obtain.   These coins are often mere rude lozenges of silver, while others are round or octangular.   Charles also struck <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num>-shilling</measure> and <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num>-shilling</measure> pieces. The coins of the early part of Charles's. reign were executed by Nicholas Briot, an admirable French engraver; but Cromwell employed Thomas Simon, a pupil of Briot, who far excelled his master, and, indeed, any previous coinengraver since the time of the Greeks. 
<P>Simon was dismissed by Charles II., in   spite of an incomparable crown-piece which he executed, to prove. his skill. Simon attained a finish and perfection since unknown.      In this degenerate reign was struck the <num value="1">first</num> guinea-so called from being made from   gold brought from   Guinea by the   African   Company, whose badge, the elephant, appears on all coins made from their bullion.   The antiquarian crochet, that the name has reference to the French province of Guienne, is absurd. Fiveguinea pieces, <num value="2">two</num>-guineas, and half-guineas were also struck in this reign.   The copper coinage was also now <num value="1">first</num> originated, and the Mint poured forth floods of halfpence and farthings, disgraced by the figure of Britannia modelled from   <num value="1">one</num> of Charles's mistresses, afterwards Duchess of   Richmond. Charles II. also coined tin farthings with copper centres. James, and William and Mary continued these coins, and added a halfpenny of the same kind.   This tin coinage was finally recalled in <datestruct value="1693--"><year reg="1693">1693</year></datestruct>. Good kings strike good coins. Thus the reign of William and Mary had the purer money (thanks, probably, to the genius of Paterson, the originator of the Bank).   It is recorded that, in <datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>, <num value="572">572</num> bags of silver coin brought to the Mint, which ought to have weighed over <measure value="18450l." type=currency><num value="18450">18,450</num> pounds</measure>, only weighed a little more than half. This single re-coinage, therefore, must have cost the Government nearly <num value="2">two</num> millions. 
<P>Queen Anne struck no less than <num value="6">six</num> different farthings; some of these are very scarce. George I. struck the <num value="1">first</num> gold quarter-guinea, and for the <num value="1">first</num> time coins bear the letters <QUOTE>F. D.</QUOTE> (<foreign lang=la>Fidei Defensor</foreign>), possibly from the fact that George had no religion at all, and only guarded other people's. Gold <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">seven</num>-shilling</measure> pieces, and copper pennies and twopences, <num value="1">first</num> appeared in the reign of George III. The guinea and half-guinea were withdrawn in <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, when they were replaced by the present sovereign and half-sovereign. Almost the last new pieces were the fourpenny-pieces of William IV., in <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>, and that <num value="1">first</num> approach to the decimal system, the florin, the most insipidly engraved of all our coins, in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>. Bronze coinage was issued on the <datestruct VALUE="1860-12-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>. 
<P>It is difficult to say from whence our early mints derived their bullion.   Edward I., the authorities tell us, drew no less than <measure value="704l." type=currency><num value="704">704</num> pounds</measure> weight of native silver from Devonshire in <num value="1">one</num> year alone; and down to the reign of George I. money was coined from Welsh and other native mines.   In later times Peru sent its silver, Mexico its gold, and, before Californian and Australian gold was discovered, the Ural mountains furnished us with ore. 
<P>Our wars, more especially our Spanish wars, have at times brought great stores of the precious metals to the Mint. The day the eldest son of George III. was born there arrived in London <num value="20">twenty</num> wagons of Spanish silver, captured by the 
<hi rend=italics>Hermione</hi>. The treasure weighed <num value="65">sixty-five</num> tons, and was valued at nearly a million sterling.   The wagons were escorted by light horse and marines, and a band of music. As they passed St. James's Palace George III. and the nobility came to the windows over the palace-gate to see them. pass. In <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct> there was a similar procession of treasure from   Spanish vessels we had dishonestly seized before the open declaration of war. In <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct> <num value="10">ten</num> wagons brought to the Bank the <num value="1">first</num> portion of the Chinese ransom, amounting to <num value="2">two</num> millions of dollars, and weighing upwards of <num value="65">sixty-five</num> tons. 
<P>For many centuries , as Mr. Saunders has shown, our kings, always in want of money, encouraged alchemists, who believed that they could transmute baser metals to gold, if they could only discover <pb id="P.105" n="105"> their common base. Thus Lully worked in the Tower for Edward I. Edward III., Henry VI., and Edward IV. also seem to have been deluded by impostors or fanatics to the same belief which Chaucer ridiculed so admirably. 
<P>A modern essayist has graphically described the present method of coining money. <QUOTE>The <num value="1">first</num> place,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>that I was conducted to was the Central Office, where the ingots of gold are weighed when they come in from the Bank of England, or from-other sources, and where a small piece is cut off each slab for the Mint assayer to test the whole by. A nugget of gold may be of any shape, and is generally an irregular dead yellow lump, that looks like pale ginger-bread ; but an ingot of gold is a small brick. After the precious metals have been scrupulously weighed in the Central Office, they are sent to the Melting House down an iron tramway. All the account books in the Mint are balanced by weight, so that even where there is so much money there is no use made of the <num value="3">three</num> columns bearing the familiar headings of &pound;   s. d. The Melting House is an old-fashioned structure, having what I may call the gold kitchen on <num value="1">one</num> side, and the silver kitchen on the other, with just such a counting-house between the <num value="2">two</num>-well provided. with clean weights, scales, well-bound books, and well-framed almanacks--as George Barnwell may have worked in with his uncle before he became gay.   The counting-house commands a view of both melting kitchens, that the superintendents may overlook the men at their work.   Although the Mint contains nearly a <num value="100">hundred</num> persons resident within its walls-forming a little colony, with peculiar habits, tastes, and class feelings of its own --a great many of the workpeople are drawn from the outer world. Dinner is provided for them all within the building; and when they pass in to their day's work, between the <num value="1">one</num> soldier and the <num value="2">two</num> policemen at the entrance gate, they are not allowed to depart until their labour is finished, and the books of their department are balanced, to see that nothing is missing. If all is found right, a properly signed certificate is given to each man, and he is then permitted to go his way. 
<P>The gold kitchen and the silver kitchen are never in operation on the same day, and the <num value="1">first</num> melting process that I was invited to attend was the <num value="1">one</num> in the latter department.   The presiding cook, well protected with leather apron and thick coarse gloves, was driving <num value="4">four</num> ingot bricks of solid silver into a thick plumbago crucible, by the aid of a crowbar.   When these <num value="4">four</num> pieces were closely jammed down to a level with the surface of the melting-pot, he seasoned it with a sprinkling of, base coin, by way of alloy; placing the crucible in <num value="1">one</num> of the circular recesses over the fiery ovens to boil.   The operations in the gold kitchen are similar to this, except that they are on a much smaller scale. A crucible is there made to boil <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> ingots, worth from <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="5">five</num> thou. sand pounds sterling; and where machinery is employed in the silver kitchen, much of the work is done in the gold kitchen with long iron tongs that are held in the hand. 
<P>When the solid metal has become fluid, a revolving crane is turned over the copper, and the glowing, red-hot crucible is drawn from its fiery recess, casting its heated breath all over the apartment, and is safely landed in a rest.   This rest is placed over a number of steel moulds, that are made up, when cool, like pieces of a puzzle, and which look like a large metal mouth-organ standing on end, except that the tubes there present are square in shape and all of the same length. The crucible rest is acted upon by the presiding cook and another man, through the machinery in which it is placed, and is made to tilt up at certain stages, according to regulated degrees.    When the molten metal, looking like greasy milk, has poured out of the crucible till it has filled the <num value="1">first</num> tube of the metal mouth-organ, sounding several octaves of fluid notes, like the tone of bottle-emptying, the framework of moulds is moved on <num value="1">one</num> stage by the same machinery, so as to bring the <num value="2">second</num> tube under the mouth of the crucible, which is then tilted up another degree.   This double action is repeated until the whole blinking, white-heated interior of the crucible is presented to my view, and nothing remains within it but a few lumps of red-hot charcoal. 
<P>The next step is to knock asunder the framework of moulds, to take out the silver, now hardened into long dirty-white bars, and to place these bars <num value="1">first</num> in a cold-water bath, and then upon a metal counter to cool. These bars are all cast according to a size which experience has taught to be exceedingly eligible for conversion into coin. 
<P>From   the silver-melting process, I was taken to the gold-coining department, the <num value="1">first</num> stage in dealing with the precious metals being, as I have before stated, the same.   Passing from bars of silver to bars of gold, I entered the Great Rolling Room, and began my <num value="1">first</num> actual experience in the manufacture of a sovereign. 
<P>The bars of gold, worth about <measure value="1200l." type=currency><num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> pounds</measure> sterling, that are taken into the Great Rolling Room are about <num value="21">twenty-one</num> inches long <num value="1">one</num> and <num value="3">three</num>-eighths of an inch broad, and an inch thick. As they lie upon the heavy truck, before <pb id="P.106" n="106"> they are subjected to the action of the ponderous machinery in this department, they look like cakes of very bright yellow soap. 
<P>An engine of <num value="30">thirty</num> horse-power sets in motion the machinery of this room, whose duty it is to flatten the bars until they come out in ribands of an <num value="8">eighth</num> of an inch thick, and considerably increased in length. This process, not unlike mangling, is performed by powerful rollers, and is repeated until the ribands are reduced to the proper gauged thickness, after which they are divided and cut into the proper gauged lengths. Having undergone <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> annealings in brick ovens attached to this department, these fillets may be considered ready for another process, which takes place, after <num value="12">twelve</num> hours' delay, in a place that is called the Drawing Room. 
<P>In this department the coarser work of the Rolling Room   is examined and perfected. The fillets or ribands of gold, after being subjected to another rolling process, the chief object of which has been to thin both ends, are taken to a machine called a draw-bench, where their thickness is perfectly equalised from end to end. The thin end of the golden riband is passed between <num value="2">two</num> finelypolished fixed steel cylinders into the mouth of a part of the concrete machine, which is called a  <Q>dog.</Q>  This dog is a small iron carriage, travelling upon wheels over a bench, under which revolves an endless chain. In length and appearance this dog is like a seal, with a round, thick head, containing <num value="2">two</num> large eyes that are formed of screws, and having a short-handled inverted metal mallet for a hat. Its mouth is large and acts like a vice, and when it has gripped the thin end of the golden riband in its teeth, its tail is affixed to the endless chain, which causes it to move slowly along the bench, dragging the riband through the fixed cylinders. When the riband has passed through its whole length, the thin end at its other extremity coming more quickly through the narrow space between the cylinders causes it to release itself with a sudden jerk, and this motion partly raises the mallet cap of the backing dog, which opens its broad mouth, and drops its hold of the metal badger which it has completely drawn. A workman now takes the fillet, and punches out a circular piece the exact size of a sovereign, and weighs it. If the golden dump or blank, as it is called, is heavy, the dog and the cylinders are put in requisition once more to draw the riband thinner; but if the weight is accurate (and perfect accuracy at this stage is indispensable), the smooth, dull, impressionless counter, looking like the brass button of an Irishman's best blue coat, is transferred to another department, called the Press Cutting Room. 
<P>In this room <num value="12">twelve</num> cutting-presses, arranged on a circular platform, about <num value="2">two</num> feet in height, surround an upright shaft and a horizontal revolving fly-wheel; and at. the will of <num value="12">twelve</num> boys, who attend and feed the presses, the punches attached to the presses are made to rise and fall at the rate of a stroke a <num value="2">second</num>. The ribands, cut into handy lengths, are given to the boys, who push them under the descending punches as sliding-frames are pushed under table microscopes. The blanks fall into boxes, handily placed to receive them, and the waste-like all the slips and cuttings, trial dumps, failures, &amp;c., in every department--is weighed back to the melting kitchen for the next cooking day. 
<P>From the Weighing Room I followed the dumps that were declared to be in perfect condition to a department called the Marking Room, where they received their <num value="1">first</num> surface impression. This room contains <num value="8">eight</num> machines, whose duty it is to raise a plain rim, or protecting edge, round the surface circumference of the golden blanks. This is done by dropping them down a tube, which conducts them horizontally to a bed prepared for them, where they are pushed backwards and forwards between <num value="2">two</num> grooved <Q>cheeks</Q> made of steel, which raise the necessary rim by pressure. 
<P>From this department I am taken by my guide to a long bakehouse structure, called the Annealing Room. Here I find several men-cooks very busy with the golden-rimmed blanks, making them into pies of <num value="3000">three thousand</num> each, in cast-iron pans with wrought-iron lids, and closed up with moist Beckenham clay. These costly pies are placed in large ovens, where they are baked in intense heat for an hour, and then each batch is drawn as its time expires, and is not opened before the pan becomes cool. The grey plastic loam which was placed round the dish is baked to a red crisp cinder, and the golden contents of the pie are warranted not to tarnish after this fiery ordeal by coming in contact with the atmosphere. 
<P>I next follow the golden annealed blanks to the Blanching Room, where they are put into a cold-water bath to render them cool; after which they are washed in a hot weak solution of sulphuric acid and water to remove all traces of surface impurity. Finally, after another wash in pure water, they are conveyed to a drying-stove, where. they are <num value="1">first</num> agitated violently in a heated tub, then turned into a sieve, and tossed about out of sight, amongst a heap of beechwood sawdust, kept hot upon an oven. After this playful process, they are sifted into the upper world once more, and <pb id="P.107" n="107"> then transferred to trays, like butchers' trays, which are conveyed to the Stamping Room. 
<P>The Coining-press Room contains <num value="8">eight</num> screw presses, worked from above by invisible machinery. Below, there is a cast-iron platform; and above, huge fly-arms, full <num value="6">six</num> feet long, and weighty at their ends, which travel noisily to and fro, carrying with them the vertical screw, and raising and depressing the upper die. In front of each press, when the machinery is in motion, a boy is sitting to fill the feeding-tube with the bright plain dumps of gold that have come from the sawdust in the Blanching Room. On the bed of the press is fixed <num value="1">one</num> of Mr. Wyon's head-dies, a perfect work of art, that is manufactured in the building; and the self-acting feeding apparatus--a slide moving backwards and forwards, much the same as in the delicate weighing-machines--places the golden dumps <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> on the die. The boy in attendance now starts some atmospheric pressure machinery, by pulling a starting-line; the press and upper die are brought down upon the piece of unstamped gold that is lying on the lower die, along with a collar that is milled on its inner circumference, and which closes upon the coin with a spring, preventing its undue expansion, and at <num value="1">one</num> forcible but. well-directed blow, the blank dump has received its top, bottom, and side impression, and has become a perfect coin of the realm. The feeder advances with steady regularity, and while it conveys another dump to the die, it chips the perfect sovereign   down an inclined plane; the upper machinery comes down again; the dump is covered out of sight, to appear in an instant as a coin; other dumps advance, are stamped, are pushed away, and their places immediately taken. Some sovereigns roll on <num value="1">one</num> side instead of going over to the inclined plane, others lie upon the edge of the machinery, or under the butcher's tray that holds the dumps, and the boys take even less notice of them than if they were so many peppermint drops. 
<P>The metal has passed no locked doorway in its progress without being weighed out of <num value="1">one</num> department into another; and it undergoes yet <num value="1">one</num> more weighing before it is placed into bags for delivery to the Bank of England or private bullion-holders, and consigned to a stone and iron strong-room, containing half a million of coined money, until the hour of its liberation draws nigh.</QUOTE>

<P>Stow describes a Jewish quarter near the Tower. <QUOTE>There was,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>a place within the liberties of the Tower called the Jewry, because it was inhabited by Jews, where there happened, <num value="22">22nd</num> Henry III., a robbery and a murther to be committed by William Fitz Bernard, and Richard his servant; who came to the house of Joce, a Jew, and there slew him and his wife Henna. The said William was taken at St. Saviour's for a certain silver cup, and was hanged. Richard was called for, and was outlawed. <num value="1">One</num> Miles le Espicer, who was with them, was wounded, and fled to a church, and died in it. No attachment was made by the sheriffs, because it happened in the Jewry; and so belonged not to the sheriffs, but to the Constable of the Tower.</QUOTE> 
<P>The churches near Tower Hill demand a brief notice. <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.107.1">That of Allhallows, Barking</LEMMA>, and Our Lady, in Tower Street, Stow mentions as having, in the early ages, a <QUOTE>faire, chapel</QUOTE> of Our Lady on the north side, founded <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.107.2">Richard I.</LEMMA>, whose lion heart, as the erroneous tradition went, was buried there, under the high altar. Edward I. gave the chapel a statue of the Virgin. Edward IV. permitted his cousin, John Earl of Worcester, to form a brotherhood there, and gave them the advowson of Streatham and part of a Wiltshire priory for maintenance. Richard III. rebuilt the chapel, and founded a college of priests, consisting of a dean and <num value="6">six</num> canons, and made Edmund Chaderton, a great favourite of his, dean. The college was suppressed and pulled down in the reign of Edward VI. The ground remained a garden plot till the reign of Elizabeth, when merchants' warehouses were built there by Sir William Winter, whose wife was buried in the church. 
<P>The church derives its name of Barking from the vicarage having originally belonged to the abbey <pb id="P.108" n="108"> and convent of Barking, in Essex. The church was much injured in <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct> by an accidental explosion of <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> barrels of gunpowder at a shipchandler's near the churchyard. A Mr. Leyborn, quoted by Strype, gives the following account of this calamity:-- 
<P> <QUOTE>Over against the wall of Barking churchyard,</QUOTE> says Leyborn, <QUOTE>a sad and lamentable accident befell by gunpowder, in this manner. <num value="1">One</num> of the houses in this place was a ship-chandler's, who, upon the <datestruct VALUE="1649-01-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>, about <num value="7">seven</num> of the clock at night, being busy in his shop about barrelling up of gunpowder, it took fire, and in the twinkling of an eye blew up not only that, but all the houses thereabouts, to the number (towards the street and in back alleys) of <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num>. The number of persons destroyed by this blow could never be known, for the next house but <num value="1">one</num> was the Rose Tavern, a house never at that time of night but full of company; and that day the parish dinner was in that house. And in <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> days after, digging, they continually found heads, arms, legs, and half bodies, miserably torn and scorched, besides many whole bodies, not so much as their clothes singed. In the course of this accident I 
<FIGURE id="Fig.108" n="2000.07.0042"><HEAD>The Church Of Allhallows, Barking, In <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 will instance <num value="2">two</num>, the <num value="1">one</num> a dead, the other a living monument. In the digging, as I said before, they found the mistress of the house of the Rose Tavern, sitting in her bar, and <num value="1">one</num> of the drawers standing by the bar's side with a pot in his hand, only stifled with dust and smoke; their bodies being preserved whole by means of great timbers falling cross <num value="1">one</num> upon another: this is <num value="1">one</num>. Another is this: the next morning there was found upon the upper leads of Barking Church a young child lying in a cradle, as newly laid in bed, neither the child nor cradle having the least sign of any fire or other hurt. It was never known whose child it was, so that <num value="1">one</num> of the parish kept it for a memorial; for in the year <datestruct value="1666"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct> I saw the child, grown to be then a proper maiden, and came to the man that had kept her all that time, where he was drinking at a tavern with some other company then present, and he told us she was the child that was so found in the cradle upon the church leads as aforesaid.</QUOTE> 
<P>Allhallows, from its vicinity to the Tower, was the burial-place of several State criminals, and many minor Court officials; the poet Earl of Surrey, Bishop Fisher, and the narrow-brained Laud, were buried there, but have been since removed. The <pb id="P.109" n="109"> <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> brasses preserved here are, says an authority, among the best in London. The finest is a Flemish brass, Andrew Evyngar, a salter, and his wife, <hi rend=italics>circa</hi> <datestruct value="1535--"><year reg="1535">1535</year></datestruct>. There is also an injured brass of William Thynne, Clerk of the Green Cloth, Clerk of the Kitchen, and afterwards <QUOTE>Master of the Honourable Household of King Henry VIII., our Sovereign Lord.</QUOTE> This worthy man published the <num value="1">first</num> edition of the entire works of Chaucer, in <datestruct value="1532--"><year reg="1532">1532</year></datestruct>. Strype mentions the monument of Humfry Monmouth, a draper and sheriff, who protected Tindal, and encouraged him in his translation of the Testament, for which he was thrown into the Tower by Sir Thomas More. In his will he appointed Bishop Latimer,   Dr. Barnes (the <QUOTE>Hot Gospeller</QUOTE> ), 
<FIGURE id="Fig.109" n="2000.07.0043"><HEAD>St. Dunstan's-In-The-East.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 and <num value="2">two</num> other reformed preachers, to preach <num value="30">thirty</num> sermons (<num value="2">two</num> a week) at Allhallows, which, he said, would do more good than having masses said for his soul. He also forbad at his funeral the superstitious use of candles, the singing of dirges, and the tolling of bells. In the chancel Strype mentions the monument of Dr. Kettlewell, a famous controversial divine, who wrote <title>Measures of Christian Obedience,</title> and refused to take the oaths on the accession of William of Orange. 
<P>In the pavement of the south aisle, near the chancel, is a large brass, to the memory of John Rulche, who died in <datestruct value="1498--"><year reg="1498">1498</year></datestruct>. There is another, with small figures of a man and his <num value="2">two</num> wives, with the date <datestruct value="1500"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct>. From the mouths of the figures rise <pb id="P.110" n="110"> labels (as in old caricatures), with pious invocations of <QUOTE lang=la>Libera nos,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE lang=la>Salve nos.</QUOTE>   Another brass of a nameless knight and his lady is dated <datestruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct>; and in the north aisle there is an ecclesiastic and a lady, date probably, says Mr. Godwin, <datestruct value="1437--"><year reg="1437">1437</year></datestruct>. On a pillar in the south aisle is a brass plate, with doggerel verses to the memory of Armac Aymer, Governor of the Pages of Honour, or Master of the Henchmen, to Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth, having served in the royal household <num value="56">fifty-six</num> years. At the north side of the chancel stands a panelled altar tomb, of carved granite, crowned with strawberry leaves. Under a canopy are <num value="2">two</num> groups of figures--the father and <num value="3">three</num> sons, the mother and <num value="4">four</num> daughters. Strype seems to erroneously connect this tomb with that of Thomas Pilke, who founded a chantry here in <datestruct value="1392--"><year reg="1392">1392</year></datestruct> (Richard II.). Pilke's is more likely the canopied <num value="1">one</num> on the opposite side of the church, with a plate of brass, on which is represented the resurrection of Christ. 
<P>The earliest legend connected with this very old church is <num value="1">one</num> relating to <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.110.1">Edward I.</LEMMA>   That warlike king had a vision, which commanded him to erect an image of the Virgin at Allhallows Barking, promising him if he did, visited it <num value="5">five</num> times every year, and kept the chapel in repair, he should be victorious over all nations, should be King of England when his father died, and conqueror of Wales and Scotland. To the truth of this vision Edward swore before the Pope, and obtained a dispensation of <num value="40">forty</num> days' penance for all true penitents who should contribute towards the lights, ornaments, and repairs of the chapel, and should pray for the soul of King Richard, whose heart was, as it is said, buried before the high altar. The pilgrims and worshippers of Our Lady of Barking continued numerous till the Reformation came and broke up these empty superstitions. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1639--"><year reg="1639">1639</year></datestruct> the Puritan House of Commons proceeded against Dr. Layfield, the vicar of Allhallows, who had introduced various Popish innovations. The parishioners complained that he had altered the position of the communion-table, set up various images, had erected a cross over the font, placed the letters I.H.S. in <num value="41">forty-one</num> various places, and also that he had bowed several times during the administration of the sacrament. The vicar, however, contrived to escape punishment. At the Great Fire this interesting church had a narrow escape, the vicarage being burned down. The present brick steeple was built in <datestruct value="1659--"><year reg="1659">1659</year></datestruct>, when the churchwardens put over the clock, which projects from the front of the church, the figure of an angel sounding a trumpet. In <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct> the succeeding churchwardens removed this figure, and placed it over the altar; but the clergyman being seen to perform genuflexions before it, the churchwardens were indicted, and compelled to burn the image. 
<P>The church, from an architectural point of view, is well worth a visit. The round massive pillars and sharp-pointed arches of the west end date from the beginning of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century, while the eastern portion of the church is Perpendicular and Late Decorated. There is a clerestory, containing <num value="7">seven</num> windows, and the windows of the north and south aisles are of different periods. It is said that many years ago the basement of a wall was found running across the building near the pulpit, showing an earlier and a later structure. The roof and ceiling were constructed in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, at a cost of <measure value="7000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="7000">7,000</num></measure>. The marble font has a carved wooden cover (attributed, of course, to Gibbons), which represents <num value="3">three</num> angels plucking flowers and fruit. On the south side of the building is an old staircase turret, which formerly led to the roof, but is now stopped up. In the porch, on the same side, is a good Tudor doorway. 
<P>Dr. Hickes, the great scholar who wrote the 
<title>Thesaurus,</title> was vicar of Allhallows for <num value="6">six</num> years (<datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>-<num value="6">6</num>). Hickes, a Yorkshireman, born in <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>, was chaplain, in <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>, to the Duke of Lauderdale, the mischievous High Commissioner of Scotland, and was sent to Charles's court, with Bishop Burnet, to report the discontent of the Scotch. He was presented to the living of Allhallows by Archbishop Sancroft. At the Restoration of <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>, Dr. Hickes refused to take the oath of allegiance, and afterwards went over to France, to see King James, on the dangerous mission of arranging the consecration of fresh bishops. Hickes was very learned in the fathers and in the old northern languages, and wrote much for Divine right. 
<P>Another church of interest in this neighbourhood is <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.111.1">St. Olave's Hart Street</LEMMA> at the corner of Seething Lane. This saint was the warlike King of Norway who helped Ethelred against the Danes. There was a church on this spot at least as long ago as <datestruct value="1319--"><year reg="1319">1319</year></datestruct>, for we find in that year the prior and brethren of the Holy Cross paying <measure value="2bmark" type=currency><num value="2">two</num> marks</measure> and a half per annum to the rector, and his successors for ever, for any damage that might accrue to them by the building of the priory. The patronage was <num value="1">first</num> vested in the Nevil family, then in that of Lord Windsor; but in <datestruct value="1651--"><year reg="1651">1651</year></datestruct> it was bequeathed to the parish by Sir Andrew Riccard, who was Sheriff of London in <datestruct value="1651--"><year reg="1651">1651</year></datestruct>. Maitland mentions, in the middle aisle, a brass of <QUOTE>a King of Arms, in his coat and crown,</QUOTE> date <datestruct value="1427"><year reg="1427">1427</year></datestruct>.   The most ancient <pb id="P.111" n="111"> brass now to be found is apparently that to the memory of John Orgene and Ellyne his wife, date <datestruct value="1584"><year reg="1584">1584</year></datestruct>. Near this is a fine monument to that <num value="1">first</num> of our English herbalists, Dr. William Turner, who died in <datestruct value="1614--"><year reg="1614">1614</year></datestruct>. This deep student was a violent Reformer, whom Bishop Gardiner threw into prison. On his release he went to live abroad, and at Basle became the friend of Gesner, the great naturalist. In the reign of Edward VI. he was made Dean of Wells and chaplain to the Protector Somerset, in which former dignity Elizabeth reinstated him. 
<P>On the south side of the communion-table there was, according to Strype, a monument to that brave and witty man, Sir John Mennes, or Minnes, vice-admiral to Charles I., and, after the Restoration, Governor of Dover Castle, and Chief Comptroller of the Navy. Born in the year <datestruct value="1598"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, and holding a place in the Navy Office in the reign of James I., Minnes, after many years of honest and loyal service, died in <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, at the Navy Office in Seething Lane, where he must have spent half his long-shore life. He is generally spoken of as a brave, honest, generous fellow, and the best of all good company. Some of his poems are contained in a volume entitled <title>The Muses' Recreation,</title>
 <datestruct value="1656--"><year reg="1656">1656</year></datestruct>, and he was the author of a clever scoffing ballad on his brother poet, Sir John Suckling's, foolish vaunts and miserable failure. In <title>The Muses' Recreation</title> we find the celebrated lines, so often quoted, and which are almost universally attributed to Butler, whose Hudibrastic manner they so exactly resemble-

<P>In the chancel, near the monument of Lord Bayning, mentioned by <num value="1">one</num> of Stow's commentators as then hung with coat of arms and streamers, is a monument to the wife of Samuel Pepys, the Secretary to the Navy, who wrote the delightful stultifying <title>Diary</title> which we have so often quoted.

Mrs. Pepys was the daughter of a French Huguenot gentleman, who had been gentleman carver to Queen Henrietta, and was dismissed for striking <num value="1">one</num> of the queen's friars, who had rebuked him for not attending mass. Mrs. Pepys had been brought up in a Ursuline convent in France, and this fact was probably remembered when the Titus Oates party endeavoured to connect poor Pepys with the (supposed) murder of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey. In this same church was also buried Thomas Pepys, brother of the diary-keeper, whose funeral Pepys records with a curious mixture of grief, thrift, and want of feeling. The entry notes some curious customs of the period:--

<P>Under the organ gallery, at the west end of the church, is a sculptured marble figure, set up by the Turkey Company, to Sir Andrew Riccard, the great benefactor of the parish, and a potent man after the Restoration, being chairman of both the East-India Company and the Turkey Company.

The other windows are flatter at the top, and the ceilings of the aisles are studded with small stars. The corbels on the north side are formed of angels, holding shield. There was formerly a gallery on the south side of the church, for the august officers of the Navy Office. Here Samuel Pepys must have often dozed solemnly. This gallery was approached by a small quaint staircase on the outside of the church, as seen by an old engraving, published in <datestruct value="1726--"><year reg="1726">1726</year></datestruct>, by West and Toms. The churchyard gate is adorned with <num value="5">five</num> skulls, in the true pagan churchwarden taste of the last century.

<P>Mr. Godwin complains that though this church was <num value="1">one</num> of Wren's best works in the Pointed style, yet still that the mouldings of the tower are too Italian, the clock-case out of character, and the sunk panels on the pinnacles very shallow and tame.

<P>In digging the foundations for the present church the workmen found immense walls of chalk and rubble stretching in all directions, especially northwards, where the monks are supposed to have dwelt.

The old Purbeck marble floor was worn away several inches by the monks' sandals, and there were in the same porch some side benches of stone, and a curious window with <num value="4">four</num> columns.   Glazed tiles of the old church-floor were found <num value="2">two</num> feet below the pavement, and at the east end fragments of a large mullioned window.

In <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct> the church became ruinous, the roof of the nave thrusting out the wall <num value="7">seven</num> inches.

The roof of the centre aisle is remarkable for some elegant fan-groining, and the side aisles have flat panelled ceilings in the corrupt Gothic style of <num value="50">fifty</num> years ago. 
<P>The register-books of St. Dunstan's, which date back as far as <datestruct value="1558--"><year reg="1558">1558</year></datestruct>, escaped the Great Fire, and are in a fine state of preservation.

It was incorporated in <datestruct value="1529--"><year reg="1529">1529</year></datestruct>, by the name of <QUOTE>The Master, Wardens, and Assistants of the Guild, or Fraternity, or Brotherhood of the Most Glorious and Undividable Trinity, and of St. Clement, in the parish of Deptford Strond, in the county of Kent,</QUOTE> and the mother house, pulled

 down in <datestruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></datestruct>, was situated at Deptford. In <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct> its <num value="1">first</num> lighthouse was erected, all lighthouses which had previously existed on the English coast having been built by private individuals under a patent from the Crown. It was not till the year <datestruct value="1854"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct> that the private rights in light-dues were abolished, and the exclusive right of lighting and buoying the coast given over to the Trinity House Board. They also bind and enroll apprentices to the sea; examine the mathematical boys of Christ's Hospital; examine mathematical masters for the navy; and place and alter all the buoys, beacons, and sea-marks along the English coast.   By an Act passed in the <num value="8">8th</num> Elizabeth, they also survey the channel of the Thames and other ports. To them   once belonged the power of ballasting all ships going out of the Thames, the ballast to be taken from the more dangerous shelves, and where the river needed deepening; and, at request of masters, they could also certify to goods <QUOTE>damnified</QUOTE> by evil stowing. They gave licences to poor, aged, and maimed mariners to row <QUOTE>upon the river of Thames</QUOTE> without licence from the Watermen's Company. They could prevent foreigners serving on board our ships without licence; they heard <pb id="P.116" n="116"> and determined complaints by officers and men in the merchant service; and, lastly, they could punish seamen for mutiny and desertion. 
<P>The Trinity House bye-laws of the reign of James II. contain some curious regulations. Every master homeward bound, for instance, was to unshot his guns at Gravesend, on penalty of <num value="20">twenty</num> nobles. 
<P>The corporation consists of a master, deputymaster, <num value="31">thirty-one</num> elder brethren, and an unlimited number of humbler members. In Pennant's time it consisted of a master, <num value="4">four</num> wardens, <num value="8">eight</num> assistants, and eighteen elder brethren, and they seem to have been known as <QUOTE>the <num value="31">Thirty-one</num> Brethren.</QUOTE> The elder brothers are generally selected from old commanders--in the navy and merchant service; and now and then a compliment is paid to a prince or a nobleman who could not, perhaps, steer a collier to Newcastle. The revenue of the corporation, about   <measure value="300000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300000">300,000</num></measure> a year, arises from tonnage, ballastage, beaconage, and licensing pilots; and this sum, after defraying the expenses of lighthouses, and paying off the portion of the debt incurred by the purchase of all existing private rights in lighthouses, is chiefly expended in maintaining poor disabled seamen and their widows and orphans, by pensions in the corporation hospital at Deptford Strand, which the master and brethren visit in their state yacht, in grand procession, on Trinity Monday. 
<P>The powers of the Trinity House in old times are fully described by Strype. They decided on maritime cases referred to them   by the Admiralty judges; they examined and gave certificates to masters of the navy; they examined pilots for the royal navy and for the merchant service. Bumboats with fruit, wine, and strong waters were not permitted by them to board vessels. Every mariner who swore, cursed, or blasphemed on board ship, was by their rules to pay <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure> to the ship's poor-box. Every mariner who got drunk was fined <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure>. No mariner, unless sick, could absent himself from prayers without forfeiting sixpence. 
<P>The previous building is shortly dismissed by Pennant with the remark that it was unworthy of the greatness of its design. <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.116.1">The present Trinity House</LEMMA> was built in <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>-<num value="5">5</num>, by Samuel Wyatt. It is of the Ionic order. On its principal front are sculptured the arms of the corporation (a cross between <num value="4">four</num> ships under sail), medallions of George III. and Queen Charlotte, genii with nautical instruments, the <num value="4">four</num> principal lighthouses on the coast, &amp;c. 
<P>The interior contains busts of Vincent, Nelson, Howe, and Duncan; William Pitt, and Captain J. Cotton, by Chantrey; George III., by Turnerelli, &amp;c. The Court-room is decorated with impersonations of the Thames, Medway, Severn, and Humber; and among the pictures is a fine painting, <num value="20">twenty</num> feet long, by Gainsborough, of the elder brethren of Trinity House. In the Boardroom are portraits of James I. and II., Elizabeth, Anne of Denmark, Earl Craven, Sir Francis Drake, Sir J. Leake, and General Monk; King William IV., the Prince Consort, and the Duke of Wellington, <num value="3">three</num> of the past masters; and George III., Queen Charlotte, and Queen Adelaide. 
<P>Of <num value="1">one</num> of the portraits Pennant gives a pleasant biography. <QUOTE>The most remarkable picture,</QUOTE> says the London historian, <QUOTE>is that of Sir John Leake, with his lank grey locks, and a loose night-gown, with a mien very little indicative of his high courage and active spirit. He was the greatest commander of his time, and engaged in most actions of note during the reigns of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.116.2">King William</LEMMA> and  Queen Anne. To him was committed the desperate but successful attempt of breaking the boom, previous to the relief of Londonderry. He distinguished himself greatly at the battle of La Hogue; assisted at-the taking of Gibraltar; and afterwards, as Commanderin-Chief, reduced Barcelona, took Carthagena, and brought Sardinia and Minorca to submit to Charles, rival to Philip for the crown of Spain. He was made a Lord of the Admiralty, but declined the offer of being the head of the commission; at the accession of George I., averse to the new family, he retired, but with the approving pension of <measure value="600l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="600">600</num></measure>   a year. He lived privately at Greenwich, where he died in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, and was buried in a manner suitable to his merits, in the church at Stepney.</QUOTE> 
<P>The museum   contains a flag taken from, the Spanish Armada by Sir Francis Drake, a model of the <hi rend=italics>Royal William</hi>, <num value="150">150</num> years old, and <num value="2">two</num> colossal globes, given by Sir Thomas Allan, admiral to Charles II.; pen-and-ink views of sea-fights (the same period), and models of lighthouses, floating lights, and lifeboats. 
<P>The office of the master of the corporation, at various times, has been held by princes and statesmen. From <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, when Lord Liverpool occupied the office of master, it was held in succession by the Marquis Camden, the Duke of Clarence (afterwards William IV.), Marquis Camden again, the Duke of Wellington, the Prince Consort, and Viscount Palmerston.

<P>Before entering the gate of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.117.1">St. Katherine's Docks</LEMMA>, where great samples of the wealth of London await our inspection, we must <num value="1">first</num> make a brief mention of the old hospital that was pulled down   in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, to make a fresh pathway for London commerce. This hospital was originally founded in <datestruct value="1148--"><year reg="1148">1148</year></datestruct> by Matilda of Boulogne, wife of the usurper Stephen, for the repose of the souls of her son Baldwin and her daughter Matilda, and for the maintenance of a master and several poor brothers and sisters. In <datestruct value="1273--"><year reg="1273">1273</year></datestruct>, Eleanor, widow of Henry III., dissolved the old foundation, and refounded it, in honour of the same saint, for a master, <num value="3">three</num> brethren, chaplains, <num value="3">three</num> sisters, <num value="10">ten</num> bedeswomen, and <num value="6">six</num> poor scholars. Opposed to this renovation, Pope Urban IV., by a bull, endeavoured in vain to reinstate the expelled prior and brotherhood, who had purloined the goods and neglected their duties. And here, in the same reign, lived that great alchemist, Raymond Lully, whom Edward III. employed in the Tower to try and discover for him the secret of transmutation. 
<P>Another great benefactress of the hospital was the brave woman, Philippa of Hainault, wife of that terror of France, Edward III. She founded a chantry and gave houses in Kent and Herts to the charity, and <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> in lands per annum for an additional chaplain. 
<P>In after years Henry V. confirmed the annual <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> of Queen Philippa for the endowment of the chantries of St. Fabian and St. Sebastian, and his son Henry VI. was likewise a benefactor to St. Katherine's Hospital. But the great encourager of the charity was Thomas de Bekington, afterwards Bishop of Bath and Wells, who, being master of the hospital in the year <datestruct value="1445"><year reg="1445">1445</year></datestruct>, obtained a charter of privileges, to help the revenue. By this charter the precincts of the hospital were declared free from all jurisdiction, civil or ecclesiastical, except that of the Lord Chancellor. To help the funds, an annual fair was to be held on   Tower Hill, to last <num value="21">twenty-one</num> days from the feast of St. James. The district had a special spiritual and a temporal court. 
<P>Henry VIII. and Katherine of Arragon founded in this place the guild or fraternity of St. Barbara, which was governed by a master and <num value="3">three</num> wardens, and included in its roll Cardinal Wolsey, the Dukes of Norfolk and Buckingham, the Earls of Shrewsbury and Northumberland, and their ladies. In <datestruct value="1526--"><year reg="1526">1526</year></datestruct> the king confirmed the liberties and franchise of this house, which even escaped dissolution in <datestruct value="1534--"><year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct>, in compliment, it has been supposed, to Queen Anne Boleyn, whom   the king had then lately married. 
<P>In the reign of Edward VI., however, all the meshes of the Reformers' nets grew smaller. Now the small fry had all been caught, the lands of St. Katherine's Hospital were taken possession of by the Crown. Greediness and avarice soon had their eye on the hospital; and in the reign of Elizabeth, Dr. Thomas Wylson, her secretary, becoming the master, surrendered up the charter of Henry VI., and craftily obtained a new <num value="1">one</num>, which left out any mention of the liberty of the fair on Tower Hill. He then sold the rights of the said fair to the Corporation of London for <measure value="466l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="466">466</num></measure> <num value="13">13</num>S. <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>d.</measure>   He next endeavoured to secure all the hospital estates, when the parishioners of the precinct began to cry aloud to Secretary Cecil, and stopped the plunderer's hand. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct> a dreadful fire destroyed <num value="100">one hundred</num> houses in the precincts, and another fire during a great storm in <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct> destroyed <num value="30">thirty</num> buildings. During the Gordon riots of <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct> a Protestant mob, headed by Macdonald, a lame soldier, and <num value="2">two</num> women-<num value="1">one</num> a white and <num value="1">one</num> a negro-armed with swords, were about to demolish the church, as being built in Popish times, when the gentlemen of the London Association arrived, and prevented the demolition. Macdonald and the <num value="2">two</num> women were afterwards hanged for this at a temporary gallows on Tower Hill. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.118.1">The church pulled down</LEMMA> to make way for the docks (religion   elbowed off by commerce) in <num value="1825">18,25</num>, was an interesting Gothic building, (exclusive of the choir) <num value="69">69</num> feet long, <num value="60">60</num> feet broad. The altar was pure Gothic, and the old stalls, of <datestruct value="1340--"><year reg="1340">1340</year></datestruct>-<num value="69">69</num>, were curiously carved with grotesque and fanciful monsters; the organ, by Green, was a fine <num value="1">one</num>, remarkable for its swell; and the pulpit, given by Sir Julius Caesar (James I., <hi rend=italics>vide</hi> our chapter on <pb id="P.118" n="118"> Chancery Lane), was a singular example of bad taste. Round the <num value="6">six</num> sides ran the following inscription:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE>Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which he had made for the preaching.</QUOTE><BIBL>--Neh. viii. <num value="4">4</num>.</BIBL></CIT></QUOTE>
 
<P>The chief tombs were those of John Holland, Duke of Exeter, his duchess, and sister. This duke fought in France in the wars of Henry VI., and died in <datestruct value="1447--"><year reg="1447">1447</year></datestruct>. He was High Admiral of England and Ireland, and Constable of the Tower. We shall describe his tomb when we come to it in Regent's Park, in the transplanted hospital, where it now is. Gibbon, the herald, an ancestor of the great historian, was also buried here. 
<P>The Queen Consorts of England are by law the perpetual patronesses of this hospital, with unlimited power. This is the only preferment in the gift of the Queen Consort. When there is no Queen Consort, the Queen Dowager has the right of nomination. The business of the establishment and appointment of subordinate officers is transacted in chapter by the master, brothers, and sisters. Among the eminent masters of this hospital we may mention Sir Julius Caesar, Sir Robert Ayton, a poet of the time of Charles I., and the Hon. George Berkeley, husband of Mrs. Howard, the mistress of George II. A curious MS. list of plate and jewels, in the Harleian Library, quoted by Dr. Ducarel, shows that the hospital possessed some altarcloths and vestments of cloth of gold and crimson velvet, green damask copes, and silken coats, for the image of St. Katherine. The Duke of Exeter left the church a beryl cup, garnished with gold and precious stones, a gold chalice, <num value="11">eleven</num> silver candlesticks, &amp;c., for the priests of his chantry chapel. 
<P>St. Katherine's Docks were begun in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, and publicly opened in <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>-a Herculean bit of work, performed with a speed and vigour unusual even to English enterprise. 
<P>The site of the docks, immediately below the Tower of London, is bounded on the north by East Smithfield, on the west and south by Tower Hill and Foss-side Road, while on the east they are separated from the London Docks by Nightingale Lane. The amount of capital originally raised by shares was between <num value="1">one</num> and <num value="2">two</num> million pounds, and was borrowed on the security of the rates to be received by the Company, for the liquidation of which debt a sinking fund was formed. Independently of the space actually occupied by the docks and warehouses, the Company possess freehold waterside property of the value of <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure>, which they were obliged to purchase by the terms of the Act of Parliament, and which yields a large annual rental, capable of very considerable improvement. In clearing the ground for this magnificent speculation, <num value="1250">1,250</num> houses and tenements were purchased and pulled down--no less than <num value="11300">11,300</num> inhabitants having to seek accommodation elsewhere. 
<P>The area thus obtained was about <num value="24">24</num> acres, of which <num value="11.50">11 1/2</num> acres are devoted to wet docks. The <num value="1">first</num> stone was laid on the <datestruct VALUE="1827-05-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, and upwards of <num value="2500">2,500</num> men were employed on the work of construction from day to day. 
<P>The <num value="2">second</num> ship that entered was <hi rend=italics>the Mary</hi>, <num value="343">343</num> tons, a Russian trader. She was laden with every description of Russian produce, and exhibited on board the pleasing spectacle of <num value="40">forty</num> veteran pensioners from Greenwich, all of whom had served under Nelson at the battle of Trafalgar. 
<P>The permanent establishment of persons employed about the dock was for a long time only <num value="100">100</num> officers and <num value="120">120</num> labourers. 
<P>The last report of the Company in <datestruct VALUE="1873-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct>, showed the earnings for <num value="6">six</num> months had been <measure value="546345l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="546345">546,345</num></measure> <measure value="11s. 1d." type=Currency><num value="11">11</num>s. <num value="1">1</num>d.</measure>; the expenditure (exclusive of interest on debenture stock, &amp;c.) to have been <measure value="348479l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="348479">348,479</num></measure>   <measure value="11s. 2d." type=Currency><num value="11">11</num>s. <num value="2">2</num>d.</measure>; showing a half-year's balance of <measure value="197865l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="197865">197,865</num></measure> <measure value="19s. 11d." type=Currency><num value="19">19</num>s. <num value="11">11</num>d.</measure> The number of loaded foreign ships which had entered the docks during the previous <num value="6">six</num> months had been <num value="696">696</num>, measuring <num value="468629">468,629</num> tons. The goods landed had been <num value="261117">261,117</num> tons, and the stock of goods in the warehouses was <num value="309819">309,819</num> tons. 
<P>Mr. Mayhew, in his <title>London Labour,</title> has some valuable notes on the unloading of ships in these docks, and on the labourers employed for that purpose: 
<P> <QUOTE>The lofty walls,</QUOTE> says Mr. Mayhew, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>which constitute it, in the language of the Custom House, a place of special security, enclose an area capable of accommodating <num value="120">120</num> ships, besides barges and other craft. 
<P>Cargoes are raised into the warehouses out of the hold of a ship without the goods being deposited on the quay. The cargoes can be raised out of the ship's hold into the warehouses of St. Katherine's in <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5">fifth</num> of the usual time. Before the existence of docks, a month or <num value="6">six</num> weeks was taken up in discharging the cargo of an East Indiaman of from <num value="800">800</num> to <num value="1200">1,200</num> tons burden; while <num value="8">eight</num> days were necessary in the summer, and <num value="14">fourteen</num> in the winter, to unload a ship of <num value="350">350</num> tons. At St. Katherine's, however, the average time now occupied in discharging a ship of <num value="250">250</num> tons is <num value="12">twelve</num> hours, and <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="500">500</num> tons <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> days, the goods being placed at the same time in the warehouse. There have been occasions when even greater dispatch <pb id="P.119" n="119"> has been used, and a cargo of <num value="1100">1,100</num> casks of tallow, averaging from   <num value="9">9</num> cwt. to <num value="10">10</num> cwt. each, has been discharged in <num value="7">seven</num> hours. This would have been considered little short of a miracle on the legal quays less than <num value="50">fifty</num> years ago. In <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, about   <num value="1000">1,000</num> vessels and   <num value="10000">10,000</num> lighters were accommodated at   St. Katherine's Dock.   The capital expended by the dock company exceeds <measure value="2000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000000">2,000,000</num></measure> of money. 
<P>The business of this establishment is carried on by <num value="335">335</num> officers, <num value="105">105</num> clerks and apprentices, <measure value="135bmark" type=currency><num value="135">135</num> mark</measure>ers, samplers, and foremen, <num value="250">250</num> permanent labourers, <num value="150">150</num>   preferable ticket labourers, propertined   to the amount of work to be   done. The average number of labourers, employed on any <num value="1">one</num> day, in <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>, was <num value="1713">1,713</num>, and the lowest number <num value="515">515</num>; so that the extreme fluctuation in the labour appears to be very nearly <num value="1200">1,200</num> hands. The lowest sum of money that was paid in <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct> for the day's work of the entire body of labourers employed was <measure value="64l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="64">64</num></measure>. <measure value="7s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="7">7</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>, and the highest sum <measure value="214l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="214">214</num></measure> <num value="2">2</num>s <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>; being a difference of very nearly <measure value="150l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="150">150</num></measure> in <num value="1">one</num> day, or <measure value="900l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="900">900</num></measure> in the course of the week. The average number of ships that enter the dock every week is <num value="17">17</num>; the highest number that entered in any <num value="1">one</num> week in <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct> was <num value="36">36</num>, and the lowest <num value="5">5</num>, being a difference of <num value="31">31</num>. Assumming these to have been of an average burden of <num value="300">300</num> tons, and that every such vessel would require <num value="100">100</num> labourers to discharge its cargo in <num value="3">three</num> days, then <num value="1500">1,500</num> extra hands ought to have been engaged to discharge the cargoes of the entire number in a week.   This, it will be observed, is very nearly equal to the highest number of the labourers employed by the Company in the year <datestruct value="1848"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>
 
<P> <QUOTE>Those persons,</QUOTE> says Mr. Mayhew, <QUOTE>who are unable to live by the occupation to which they have been educated, can obtain a living there without any previous training.   Hence we find men of every calling laboring at the docks. There are decayed and bankrupt master butchers, master bakers, publicans, grocers, old   soldiers, old sailors, Polish refugees, broken-down gentlemen, discharged   lawyers' clerks, suspended Go- Vermont clerks, almsmen, pensioners, servants, thieves---indeed every <num value="1">one</num> who wants a loaf and is willing to work for it.   The London dock is <num value="1">one</num> of the few places in the metropolis where men can get employment without either character or recommendation;   so that the labourers employed there are naturally a most incongruous assembly. Each of the docks employs several <num value="100">hundred</num> hands to ship   and discharge the cargoes of the numerous vessels that enter; and as there are some <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> of such docks attached to the metropolis, it may be imagined how large a number of Indiavisuals are dependent on them   for their sub- Sistine.</QUOTE> 
<P>The dock-work, says Mr. Mayhew, speaking of the dock labourers, whom he especially observed, may be divided into <num value="3">three</num> classes. <num value="1">1</num>. Wheel-work, or that which is moved by the muscles of the legs and weight of the body. <num value="2">2</num>. Jigger, or winch-work, or that which is moved by the muscles of the arm. In each of these the labourer is stationary; but in the truck-work, which forms the <num value="3">third</num> class, the labourer has to travel over a space of ground greater or less in proportion to the distance which the goods have to be removed. 
<P>The wheel-work is performed somewhat on the principle of the tread-wheel, with the exception that the force is applied inside, instead of outside, the wheel.   From   <num value="6">six</num> to <num value="8">eight</num> men enter a wooden cylinder or drum, upon which are nailed battens; and the men, laying hold of ropes, commence treading the wheel round, occasionally singing the while, and stamping time in a manner that is pleasant from its novelty. The wheel is generally about <num value="16">sixteen</num> feet in diameter, and <num value="8">eight</num> to <num value="9">nine</num> feet broad; and the <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> men treading within it will lift from <num value="16">sixteen</num> to eighteen hundredweight, and often a ton, <num value="40">forty</num> times an hour, an average of <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> feet high. Other men will get out a cargo of from <num value="800">800</num> to <num value="900">900</num> casks of wine, each cask averaging about <num value="5">five</num> hundredweight, and being lifted about eighteen feet, in a day and a half. At trucking, each man is said to go on an average <num value="30">thirty</num> miles a day, and <num value="2">two</num>-thirds of that time he is moving <num value="1">one</num> and a-half hundredweight, at <num value="6">six</num> miles and a-half per hour. 
<P>This labour, though requiring to be seen to be properly understood, must still appear so arduous, that <num value="1">one</num> would imagine it was not of that tempting nature that <num value="3000">3,000</num> men could be found every day in London desperate enough to fight and battle for the privilege of getting <num value="2">two</num>-and-sixpence by it; and even if they fail in <QUOTE>getting taken on</QUOTE> at the commincemeat of the day, that they should then retire to the appointed yard, there to remain hour after hour in the hope that the wind might blow them some stray ship, so that other gangs might be wanted, and the calling foreman seek them there. It is a curious sight to see the men waiting in these yards to be hired at fourpence an hour, for such are the terms given in the after part of the day. There, seated on long benches ranged round the wall, they remain, some telling their miseries and some their crimes to <num value="1">one</num> another, whilst others doze away their time.   Rain or sunshine, there <pb id="P.120" n="120">

 <pb id="P.121" n="121"> can always be found plenty to catch the stray shilling or eightpence. By the size of the shed you can tell how many men sometimes remain there in the pouring rain, rather than lose the chance of the stray hour's work.   Some loiter on the bridges close by, and presently, as their practised eye or ear tells them that the calling foreman is in want of another gang, they rush forward in a stream towards the gate, though only <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> at most can be hired out of the <num value="100">hundred</num> or more that are waiting there.   Again the same mad fight takes place as in the morning. 
<P>If you put the vessels belonging to the port of London at <num value="3000">3,000</num>, and the steamers at <num value="250">250</num> or <num value="300">300</num>, and the crews of which at <num value="35000">35,000</num> men and boys, it will be seen that the dock labourers required must be very numerous. Mr. Mayhew calculated that beside the great wealth of our docks there flows a parallel current of misery: a single day's east wind sometimes deprives <num value="2500">2,500</num> dock labourers of a day's living. He puts the men of this class at about <num value="12000">12,000</num> (it is, perhaps, even more now), and proves that their wages collectively vary from <measure value="1500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1500">1,500</num></measure> a day to <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>, and that <num value="8000">8,000</num> men are even thrown out of employ by a wind that prevents

 vessels coming. It is a terrible proof how many of our population live on the very brink of starvation, and toil, like men in a leaky boat, only to keep off death. 
<P>In no single spot of London, not even at the Bank, could so vivid an impression of the vast wealth of England be obtained as at the Docks. Here roll casks of Burgundy, as they rolled in the reign of Edward III., on the eve of Poictiers; and there by their side are chests of tea, marked all over with turnpike-gate characters, fresh from an empire where no English factory existed till the year <datestruct value="1680"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>, after many unsuccessful efforts to baffle Portuguese jealousy; and near them   are bales of exquisite silk from Yokohama--a place hardly safe for Englishmen till <datestruct value="1865"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>.

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 

 
<P>It has long been a question with English engineers, whether, as the wealth and population of the City increase, London must not some day or other be double-decked. The metropolis is going plethoric, to use a medical metaphor--it makes so much blood; and if something is not done, a stoppage must ensue. A person disposed to fat sometimes grows larger the more depletive his diet; so increased railways (like the Metropolitan) seem rather to increase than lessen the general traffic. When that undertaking was opened in <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct> it was feared that the <QUOTE>buses</QUOTE> from Paddington and Oxford Street would be driven off the line, for in the <num value="1">first</num> year the railway carried <num value="9500000">9,500,000</num> passengers. A little later it carried nearly <num value="40000000">40,000,000</num> passengers; and since it began it has carried   <num value="150000000">150,000,000</num> persons to and fro. Yet at the present moment there are more omnibuses on this line of route from the West to the City than there were when the railway started, and they are earning <num value="1">one</num> penny per mile a day more than they were before it was opened.   These facts seem almost astounding, but the surprise disappears when we remember the fact, that in dealing with London passenger traffic we are dealing with a population greater than that of all Scotland, and more than <num value="2">two</num>-thirds that of all Ireland; a population, too, which increases in a progressive ratio of about <num value="42000">42,000</num> a year. But with all this increase of numbers, which literally means increase of difficulty in moving about, the great streets most frequented grow not an inch wider.   Fleet Street and <title>Old Chepe</title> are just as narrow as in the days of Elizabeth, when the barrier stood at Ludgate; and Thames Street, which is no wider than it was in the days of Alfred, is congested with its traffic <num value="12">twelve</num> hours out of the <num value="24">twenty-four</num>. 
<P>A few years ago Mr. Barlow, a very practical engineer, came forward to meet this crying want, and offered, at a cost of <measure value="16000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="16000">16,000</num></measure>, in less than a year, to bore a subway through the bed of the Thames. The idea was not a new <num value="1">one</num>. As early as <datestruct value="1799"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct> an attempt had been made to construct a tunnel under the Thames between Gravesend and Tilbury; and in <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct> a similar work was actually begun between Rotherhithe and Limehouse, which, after proceeding <num value="1000">1,000</num> feet, broke in; <num value="54">fifty-four</num> engineers of the day deciding that such a work not only would never commercially pay, but was also impracticable. Brunel's scheme of the Thames Tunnel cost half a million of money, and took <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years' labour to complete. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.122.3">Mr. Barlow's tunnel</LEMMA>, from Tower Hill to Tooley Street, was of course looked upon as chimerical. Mr. Barlow, with less ambition and genius, but more common sense and thriftiness than his great predecessor, took good care to remember that the crown. of Brunel's arches, in some places, came within <num value="4">four</num> feet of the river water. In the Tower subway the average distance preserved is <num value="30">thirty</num> feet, and in no place is there less than eighteen feet of sound London clay between the arch and the tideway. The cardinal principle of Mr. Barlow was to sink deep into the London clay, which is as impervious to water as stone, and in which no pumping would be required. 
<P>The works were begun on <datestruct VALUE="1869-02-16"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=16>16</day>, <year reg=1869>1869</year></datestruct>, by breaking ground for the shaft on the north side of the river; in <datestruct VALUE="1870-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>, numerous visitors were conveyed from <num value="1">one</num> shaft-head to the other. The tunnel commences, as we have said, at Tower Hill, where a hoarding encloses a small square of ground, not larger than an ordinary sitting-room, for which, however, the Government made the Company pay at the rate of about <measure value="240000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="240000">240,000</num></measure> an acre. In the centre of this is a little circular shaft, about <num value="14">fourteen</num> feet diameter and <num value="60">sixty</num> feet deep, and at the end of this, facing south, a clean, bright, vaulted chamber, which serves as a waiting-room. At the end of this chamber is the tunnel, a tube of iron not unlike the adit of a mine, which, in its darkness and silence, heightened by the knowledge that this grimlooking road runs down deeply below the bed of the river, gives it at <num value="1">first</num> sight anything but an inviting appearance. The length of the whole tunnel is about <num value="1340">1,340</num> feet, or as nearly as possible about a quarter of a mile. From Tower Hill it runs in a south-west direction, and, passing under Barclay's brewery, emerges under a shaft similar to that at entering, but only <num value="50">fifty</num> feet deep, and out of this the passengers will come within a few yards of Tooley Street, close to the railway station. From the Tower Hill shaft to the centre of the river the tunnel makes a dip of about <num value="1">one</num> in <num value="30">thirty</num>. From this point it rises again at the same incline to what we may call the Tooley Street station. <pb id="P.123" n="123"> 
<P>The method of constructing the tunnel, we need hardly remark, from its excessive cheapness, was simple in the extreme.   It has been built in <num value="18">18</num>-inch lengths of cast-iron tubing, perfectly circular, each <num value="18">18</num>-inch circle being built up of <num value="3">three</num> segments, with a key-piece at the top, which, fitting in like a wedge, holds the rest with the rigidity of a solid casting. The cast-iron shield used for excavastion was less than <num value="2">two</num> and a half tons weight. In front of the shield, which was slightly concave, was an aperture about <num value="2">two</num> feet square, closed with a sliding iron water-tight door, and at the back of the shield were iron sockets, into which screwjacks fitted, and, when worked by hand, forced the shield forward.   The mode of advance was this. When a shaft on Tower Hill had been bored to a sufficient depth below the London clay, the shield was lowered and placed in its required position. The water-tight door we have spoken of as in the centre was then opened.   Through this aperture sufficient clay, just of the consistency of hard cheese, was cut away by hand till a chamber was made large enough for a man, who entered and worked till there was room for <num value="2">two</num>, and these soon made a circular space exactly the size of the shield and about <num value="2">two</num> feet deep. This done, the miners came out, and with their screw-jacks forced the shield forward into the space which they had cut, but with the long telescope-like cap of the shield still over them.   Under cover of this an <num value="18">18</num>-inch ring was quickly put in and bolted together; and while this was doing, the clay was being excavated from the front of the shield as before. Thus every <num value="8">eight</num> hours, night and day, Sundays and week days, the shield went forward eighteen inches, and eighteen inches length of iron was added to the tube, which so advanced at the rate of <num value="5">5</num> feet <num value="4">4</num> inches every <num value="24">twenty-four</num> hours. 
<P>The clay was so completely water-proof, that water had to be sent down to the workmen in cans to mix with the cement.   No traces of fresh-water shells were found; but very large clay-stones and a great many sharks' teeth and marine shells. So perfect were Mr. Barlow's calculations, that the <num value="2">two</num> opposite tunnels met within a quarter of an inch. The small interval between the iron and the clay was filled with blue lias cement, which coats the tube and protects it from oxidisation.   The gain to the East-end of London by this successful and cleverly executed undertaking is enormous, and the intercourse between the north and south banks of the Thames is greatly facilitated; and the conception has been seized upon by Mr. Bateman as the basis of his well-known suggestion for a submarine tube to carry a railway from England to France.   The Thames tube is <num value="7">7</num> feet in clear internal diameter, and it originally carried a railway of <num value="2">2</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches gauge. On this railway formerly ran an omnibus capable of conveying <num value="12">twelve</num> passengers. The omnibus was constructed of iron; it was light, but very strong, and ran upon <num value="8">eight</num> wheels, and was connected with a rope of steel wire by means of a gripe that could be at any time tightened or relaxed at pleasure, and at each end of the tunnel this wire ran over a drum worked by means of a stationary engine. 
<P>If the carriage was stopped in the centre of the tunnel, the beat of the paddles of the steamers above could be heard, and even the hammering on board ships. In time there will be subways at Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich. The next to be formed, however, is <num value="1">one</num> from St. George's Church in the Borough to Cannon Street.   The Tower subway is now only used, for foot-passengers, at a charge of <num value="1">one</num> halfpenny. 
<P>On the river side, below St. Katherine's, says Pennant, on we hardly know what authority, stood, in the reign of the Tudors, the great breweries of London, or the <QUOTE>bere house,</QUOTE> as it is called in the map of the <num value="1">first</num> volume of the <title>Civitates Orbis.</title> They were subject to the usual useful, yet vexatious, surveillance of the olden times; and in <datestruct value="1492--"><year reg="1492">1492</year></datestruct> (Henry VII.) the king licensed John Merchant, a Fleming, to export <num value="50">fifty</num> tuns of ale <QUOTE>called berre ;</QUOTE> and in the same thrifty reign <num value="1">one</num> Geffrey Gate (probably an officer of the king's) spoiled the brew-houses twice, either by sending abroad too much beer unlicensed, or by brewing it too weak for the sturdy home customers. The demand for our stalwart English ale increased in the time of Elizabeth, in whose reign we find <num value="500">500</num> tuns being exported at <num value="1">one</num> time alone, and sent over to Amsterdam probably, as Pennant thinks, for the use of our thirsty army in the Low Countries. The exportation then seems to have been free, except in scarce times, when it was checked by proclamation; but even then royal licences to brew could be bought for a consideration. 
<P>From   the old brew-houses of Elizabeth in London, that have long since passed into dreamland, we must now guide our readers forward, under swinging casks and between   ponderous wheels that seem to threaten instant annihilation, into the broad gateway of the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.124.1">London Docks</LEMMA>, the most celebrated and central of all the semimari- time brotherhood.

<P>The London Docks, built by Rennie, were opened in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>; In <datestruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct> <num value="2">two</num> new docks were constructed for the larger vessels now built, and they have <num value="28">28</num> feet depth of water.

<P> <QUOTE>As you enter the dock,</QUOTE> says Mr. Mayhew, in a pleasant picture of the scene, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>the sight of the forest of masts in the distance, and the tall chimneys vomiting clouds of black smoke, and the many-coloured flags flying in the air, has a most peculiar effect; while the sheds with the monster wheels arching through the roofs look like the paddle-boxes of huge steamers. Along the quay you see, now men with their faces blue with indigo, and now gaugers with their long brasstipped rule dripping with spirit from the cask they have been probing.   Then will come a group of flaxen-haired sailors, chattering German; and next a black sailor, with a cotton handkerchief twisted turban-like round his head. Presently a blue-smocked butcher, with fresh meat and a bunch of cabbages in the tray on his shoulder; and shortly afterwards a mate, with green paroquets in a wooden cage. Here you will see sitting on a bench a sorrowful-looking woman, with new bright cooking tins at her feet, telling you she is an emigrant preparing for her voyage. As you pass along this quay the air is pungent with tobacco; on that, it overpowers you with the fumes of rum; then you are nearly sickened with the stench of hides and huge bins of horns; and shortly afterwards the atmosphere is fragrant with coffee and spice. Nearly everywhere you meet stacks of cork, or else yellow bins of sulphur, or lead-coloured copper ore. As you enter this warehouse the flooring is sticky, as if it had been newly tarred, with the sugar that has leaked through the casks; and as you descend into the dark vaults, you see long lines of lights hanging from the black arches, and lamps flitting about midway. Here you sniff the fumes of the wine, and there the peculiar fungus-smell of dry rot; there the jumble of sounds as you pass along the dock blends in anything but sweet concord. The sailors are singing boisterous nigger songs from the Yankee ship just entering; the cooper is hammering at the casks on the quay; the chains of the cranes, loosed of their weight, rattle as they fly up again; the ropes splash in the water; some captain shouts his orders through his hands; a goat bleats from some ship in the basin; and empty casks roll along the stones with a heavy, drum-like sound. Here the heavily-laden ships are down far below the quay, and you descend to them   by ladders; whilst in another basin they are high up out of the water, so that their green copper sheathing is almost level with the eye of the passenger; while above his head a long line of bowsprits stretches far over the quay, and from them hang spars and planks as a gangway to each ship. 
<P>This immense establishment is worked by from <num value="1000">1,000</num> to <num value="3000">3,000</num> hands, according as the business is either brisk or slack. Out of this number there are always <num value="400">400</num> to <num value="500">500</num> permanent labourers, receiving on an average <measure value="16s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="16">16</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> per week, with the exception of coopers, carpenters, smiths, and other mechanics, who are paid the usual wages of those crafts. Besides these, there are many <num value="100">hundred</num>--from <num value="1000">1,000</num> to <num value="2500">2,500</num>-casual labourers, who are engaged at the rate of <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> per day in the summer, and <measure value="2s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> in the winter months. Frequently, in case of many arrivals, extra hands are hired in the course of the day, at the rate of <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> an hour. For the permanent labourers a recommendation is required, but for the casual labourers no character is demanded. The number of the casual hands engaged by the day, depends, of course, upon the amount of work to be done; and we find that the total number of labourers in the dock varies from <num value="500">500</num> to <num value="3000">3,000</num> and odd. On the <datestruct VALUE="1849-05-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>, the number of hands engaged, both permanent and casual, was <num value="2794">2,794</num>; on the <num value="26">26th</num> of the same month it was <num value="3012">3,012</num>; and on the <num value="30">30th</num> it was <num value="1189">1,189</num>.

On that supervenes a garrulous fluency of tongue that leads to high-flown remembrances of Spanish and French towns, illustrated by the   songs of the peasantry of various countries.

The chief features of such a visit are gravely treated by writer in <title>Household Words:--</title>
 
<P> <QUOTE>Proceeding down the dock-yard,</QUOTE> says the writer in question, <QUOTE>you see before you a large area literally paved with wine-casks, all full of the most excellent wines.   On our last visit, the wine then covering the ground was delicious      Bordeaux, as you. might easily convince yourself by dipping a finger into the bunghole of any cask; as, for some purpose of measurement <hi rend=italics>or</hi> testing <hi rend=italics>the</hi> quality, the casks were most of them   open.    This is, in fact, the great depot of the wine of the London merchants, no less than <num value="60000">60,000</num> pipes being capable of being stored away in the vaults here.   <num value="1">One</num> vault alone, which formerly was <num value="7">seven</num> acres, has now been extended under Gravel Lane, so that at present it contains upwards of <num value="12">twelve</num> acres.   These vaults are faintly   lit with lamps, but, on going in, you are at the entrance accosted with the singular demand,  <Q>Do you want a cooper?</Q>  Many people, not knowing its meaning, say,  <Q>No, by no means.</Q>  The meaning of the phrase is,  <Q>Do you want to taste the wines?</Q>  when a cooper accompanies you, to pierce the casks and give you the wine. Parties are every day, and all day long, making these exploratory and tasting expeditions Every <num value="1">one</num>, on entering, is presented with a lamp, at the end of a lath about <num value="2">two</num> feet long, and you soon find yourselves in some of the most remarkable caving in the world. From the dark vaulted roof overhead, especially in <num value="1">one</num> vault, hang strange figures, black as night, light as gossamer, and of a yard or more of length, resembling skins of beasts, or old shirts dipped in soot.   They are fed to this strange growth by the fumes of the wine.   For those who taste the wines the cooper bores the heads of the pipes, which are ranged throughout these vast cellars on either hand, in thousands and tens of thousands, and draws a glassful. These glasses, though shaped as wine-glasses, resemble much more goblets in their size, containing each as much as several ordinary wine-glasses. What you do not drink is thrown upon the ground; and it is calculated that at least a hogshead a day is thus consumed.</QUOTE> 
<P>In the centre of the great east vault of the wine cellars, you come to a circular building without any entrance; it is the root and foundation of the Queen's Pipe. Quitting the vault and ascending to the warehouse over it, you find that you are in the great tobacco warehouse, called the Queen's Warehouse, because the Government rent the tobacco warehouses here for <measure value="14000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="14000">14,000</num></measure> per annum. <QUOTE>This <num value="1">one</num> warehouse has no equal,</QUOTE> says a writer on the subject, <QUOTE>in any other part of the world; it is <num value="5">five</num> acres in extent, and yet it is covered with a roof, the framework of which is of iron, erected, we believe, by Mr. Barry, the architect of the new Houses of Parliament, and of so light and skilful a construction, that it admits of a view of the whole place; and so slender are the pillars, that the roof seems almost to rest upon nothing.   Under this roof is piled a vast mass of tobacco in huge casks, in double tiers--that is, <num value="2">two</num> casks in height. <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.125.2">This warehouse</LEMMA> said to hold, when full, <num value="24000">24,000</num> hogsheads averaging <measure value="1200l." type=currency><num value="1200">1,200</num> pounds</measure> each, and equal to <num value="30000">30,000</num> tons of general merchandise.

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 
<P>Sub-river tunnels are not unfrequent in the coalmining districts of the north of England.   The beds of both the Tyne and the Wear are pierced in this manner; while at Whitehaven, and at the Botallack mines in Cornwall, the bed of the ocean has been penetrated for long distances, the tunnel at the former place extending upwards of a mile beneath the sea. At the close of the last century a North-country engineer proposed a sub-aqueous passage to connect North and   South Shields, but the scheme was never carried out. The same gentleman then proposed the tunnel from Gravesend to Tilbury, mentioned by us in the preceding chapter; but it was soon abandoned as impracticable, as was also a Cornish miner's proposal to connect Rotherhithe with Limehouse. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, however, a bolder, more reckless, and far-seeing mind took up the project, and Mr. Brunel (backed by the Duke of Wellington and the eminent Dr. Wollaston) seriously submitted a plan of a tunnel to the public, and so practical a man soon obtained   listeners.   With his usual imaginative sagacity he had gone to Nature, and there found allies. The hard cylindrical shell of the soft-footed teredo <hi rend=italics>(Calamitas navium</hi>, as Linnaeus calls it), which eats its way, in small tubular tunnels, even through the tough timbers of men-of-war, had suggested to the great engineer a shield under which his workmen could shelter. 
<P>The communication between the Surrey shore and the Wapping side was most important, as the wharves for the coasting trade of England lay chiefly on the Surrey bank, and traffic had to be conveyed by   carts to the Tower-side docks. In <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, of <num value="887">887</num> wagons and <num value="3241">3,241</num> carts that passed over London Bridge southwards, <num value="480">480</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="1700">1,700</num> of the <num value="2">second</num> were found to turn down Tooley Street. It was also ascertained that the <num value="350">350</num> watermen of the neighbourhood took over the Thames no less than <num value="3700">3,700</num> passengers daily. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct> a company was formed to construct a tunnel, and an Act of Parliament was obtained. The preliminary step was <num value="3">three</num> parallel borings, like cheese-tastings, made beneath the bed of the Thames, in the direction of the proposed tunnel. As to the level to be taken, Mr. Brunel consulted the geologists, who for once were not happy in their theories. They informed the engineer that below a certain depth a quicksand would be found, and he must therefore keep above it, and as close as possible to the stratum of firm clay forming the bed of the river. The Tower Subway has since shown the absurdity of this theory, and the folly of not making preliminary experiments, however costly. If the tunnel had been begun in a different place, and at the deep level of the Tower Subway, Mr. Brunel would have saved <num value="20">twenty</num> years of labour, many lives, and about a quarter of a million of money. 
<P>In <datestruct VALUE="1825-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, the laborious and for a long time unsuccessful work was begun, by erecting a round brick cylinder <num value="42">42</num> feet high, <num value="150">150</num> feet in circumference, and <num value="150">150</num> feet distant from the river. The excavators then commenced on the inside, cutting away the earth, which was raised to the top of the shaft by a steam-engine placed there, which also relieved them from the water that occasionally impeded their progress.   The engine raised <num value="400">400</num> gallons a minute, and at a later stage served to draw carriages along the temporary tunnel railway, <pb id="P.129" n="129"> and also hoisted up and let down all things required by the masons. The bricklayers kept heightening their little circular fort as they themselves sank deeper in the earth. By this shaft <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.129.1">Mr. Brunel</LEMMA> congratulated himself he had evaded the bed of gravel and sand <num value="26">26</num> feet deep, and full of land-water, which had annoyed his predecessors. When the shaft was sunk to its present depth of <num value="65">65</num> feet, another shaft of <num value="25">25</num> feet diameter was sunk lower; and at the depth of <num value="80">80</num> feet the ground suddenly gave way, and sand and water were, as Mr. Saunders describes it, <QUOTE>blown up with some violence.</QUOTE> 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.129.2">The tunnel</LEMMA> itself was begun at the depth of <num value="63">63</num> feet. Mr. Brunel proposed to make his tunnel <num value="38">38</num> feet broad and <num value="22.50">22 1/2</num> feet high, leaving room within for <num value="2">two</num> archways each <num value="15">15</num> feet high, and each wide enough for a single carriage-way and a footpath. The wonderful teredo shield, a great invention for a special object, consisted of <num value="12">twelve</num> separate divisions, each containing <num value="3">three</num> cells, <num value="1">one</num> above another. When an advance was required, the men in their cells pulled down the top poling-board defences, and cut away the earth about. <num value="6">six</num> inches; the polingboards in each division below were then <hi rend=italics>seriatim</hi>
 removed, and the same amount of earth removed, and then replaced. <QUOTE>Each of the divisions,</QUOTE> says a describer of the shield, <QUOTE>was then advanced by the application of <num value="2">two</num> screws, <num value="1">one</num> at its head and <num value="1">one</num> at its foot, which, resting against the finished brickwork of the tunnel, impelled the shield forward into the new-cut space. The other set of divisions then advanced.</QUOTE> As the miners were at work at <num value="1">one</num> end of the cells, the bricklayers at the other were busy as bees forming the brick walls of the tunnel, top, sides, and bottom, the crushing earth above being fended off by the shield till the bricklayers had finished. Following the shield was a rolling stage in each archway, for the; assistance of the men in the upper cells. 
<P>The difficulties, however, from not keeping to the stiff, firm, and impervious London clay, proved almost insuperable, even to Mr. Brunel.   The <num value="1">first</num> <num value="9">nine</num> feet of the tunnel, driven through firm clay, in the early part of the year <datestruct value="1826"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>, were followed   by a dangerously-loose watery sand, which cost <num value="32">thirty-two</num> anxious days' labour. From March to September all went well, and <num value="260">260</num> feet of the tunnel were completed. On the <datestruct value="09-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct> Brunel prophesied an irruption of the river at the next tide. It came, but the precautions taken had rendered it harmless. By the <datestruct VALUE="1827-01-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, <num value="350">350</num> feet were accomplished, but loose clay forced itself through the shield. In April, the bed of the river had to be explored in a divingbell. Bags of clay were used to fill up depressions. A shovel and hammer, accidentally left in the river, were afterwards found in the shield during an influx of loose ground, eighteen feet below. In May, however, came the long-expected, disaster, chiefly caused by <num value="2">two</num> vessels coming in at a late tide, and mooring just above the head of the tunnel, causing a great washing away of the soil round them. Mr. Beamish,  the resident assistant engineer, thus graphically describes the irruption:-- 
<P> <QUOTE>As the water,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>rose with the tide, it increased in the frames very considerably between Nos. <num value="5">5</num> and <num value="6">6</num>, forcing its way at the front, then at the back; Ball and Compton (the occupants) most active. About a quarter before <num value="6">six</num> o'clock, No. <num value="11">11</num> (division) went forward. Clay appeared at the back. Had it closed up immediately. While this was going forward my attention was again drawn to No. <num value="6">6</num>, where I found the gravel forcing itself with the water.   It was with the utmost difficulty that Ball could keep anything against the opening. Fearing that the pumpers would now   become alarmed, as they had been once or twice before, and leave their post, I went upon the east stage to encourage them, and to choose more shoring for Ball. Goodwin, who was engaged at No. <num value="11">11</num>, where indications of a run appeared, called to Rogers, who was in the act of working down No. <num value="9">9</num>, to come to his assistance. But Rogers, having his <num value="2">second</num> poling (board) down, could not. Goodwin again called. I then said to Rogers,  <Q>Don't you hear?</Q>  upon which he left his poling for the purpose of assisting Goodwin; but before he could get to him, and before I could get fairly into the frames, there poured such an overwhelming volume of water and sludge as to force them out of the frames. William   Carps, a bricklayer, who had gone to Goodwin's assistance, was knocked down and literally rolled out of the frames on the stage, as though he had come through a mill-sluice, and would undoubtedly have fallen off the stage had I not caught hold of him, and with Rogers' assistance helped him down the ladder.   I again made an attempt to get into the frames, calling upon the miners to follow; but all was dark (the lights at the frames and stage being all blown out), and I was only answered by the hoarse and angry sounds of Father Thames's roarings.   Rogers (an old sergeant of the Guards), the only man left upon the stage, now caught my arm, and gently drawing me from the frames, said,  <Q> Come away, pray, sir, come away; &lsquo;tis no use, the water is rising fast.</Q>    I turned once more; but hearing an increased rush at No. <num value="6">6</num>, and finding the column of water at Nos. <num value="11">11</num> and    <num value="12">12</num> to be augmenting, I reluctantly descended. The cement casks, compo-boxes, pieces <pb id="P.130" n="130"> of timber were floating around me. I turned into the west arch, where the enemy had not yet advanced so rapidly, and again looked towards the frames, lest some <num value="1">one</num> might have been overtaken; but the cement casks, &amp;c., striking my legs, threatened seriously to obstruct my retreat, and it was with some difficulty I reached the visitors' bar<NOTE resp=thornbury>a bar so placed as to keep the visitors from the unfinished works).</NOTE>where Mayo, Bertram, and others were anxiously waiting to receive me. I was glad of their assistance; indeed, Mayo fairly dragged me over it. Not bearing the idea of so precipitate a retreat, I turned once more; but vain was the hope! The wave rolled onward and onward; the men retreated, and I followed. Met Gravatt coming down. Short was the question, and brief was the answer.   As we approached I met I. [Isambard] Brunel. We turned round: the effect was splendid beyond description. The water as it rose became more and more vivid, from the reflected lights of the gas. As we reached the staircase a crash was heard, and then a rush of air at once extinguished all the lights <gap> Now it was that I experienced something like dread. I looked up the shaft, and saw both stairs crowded; I looked below, and beheld the overwhelming wave appearing to move with accumulated velocity. 
<P>Dreading the effect of the reaction of this wave from the back of the shaft upon our staircase, I exclaimed to Mr. Gravatt,  <Q> The staircase will blow up!</Q>  I. Brunel ordered the men to get up with all expedition; and our feet were scarcely off the bottom stairs when the <num value="1">first</num> flight, which we had just left, was swept away. Upon our reaching the top, a bustling noise assailed our ears, some calling for a raft, others for a boat, and others again a rope; from which it was evident that some unfortunate individual was in the water. I. Brunel instantly, with that presence of mind to which I have been more than once witness, slid down <num value="1">one</num> of the iron ties, and after him Mr. Gravatt, each making a rope fast to old Tillet's waist, who, having been looking after the packing of the pumps below the shaft, was overtaken by the flood. He was soon placed out of danger.   The roll was immediately called-<hi rend=italics>not <num value="1">one</num> absent</hi>.</QUOTE>
 
<P>The next step was to repair the hole in the riverbed. Its position being ascertained by the divingbell, <num value="3000">three thousand</num> bags of clay, spiked with small hazel rods, were employed to effectually close it. In a few weeks the water was got under, and by the middle of August the tunnel was cleared of the soil that had washed in, and the engineer was able to examine his shattered fortifications. In all essentials the structure remained perfectly sound, though a part of the brickwork close to the shield had been washed away to half its original thickness, and the chain which had held together the divisions of the shield had snapped like a cotton thread. The enemy--so powerless when kept at a distance, so irresistible at its full strength-had driven deep into the ground heavy pieces of iron belonging to the shield. 
<P>Amid all these dangers the men displayed great courage and perseverance. Brunel's genius had roused them to a noble and generous disregard of the opposing principles of nature. The alarms were frequent, the apprehension incessant. At any moment the deluge might come; and the men worked, like labourers in a dangerous coal mine, in constant terror from either fire or water. Now and then a report like a cannon-shot would announce the snap of some portion of the overstrained shield; sometimes there were frightened cries from the foremost workers, as the earth and   water rushed in and threatened to sweep all before them. At the same time during these alarming irruptions, large quantities of carburetted and sulphuretted hydrogen would burst into fire, and wrap the whole place in a sudden sheet of flame. Those who witnessed these explosions describe the effect of the fire dancing on the surface of the water as singularly beautiful. The miners and bricklayers, encouraged by the steadfast hand at the helm, got quite accustomed to these outbursts, and, at the shout of <QUOTE>Fire and water!</QUOTE> used to cry, <QUOTE>Light your pipes, my boys,</QUOTE> reckless as soldiers in the trenches. 
<P>But still worse than these violent protests of Nature was a more subtle and deadly enemy. The air grew so thick and impure, especially in summer, that sometimes the most stalwart labourers were carried out insensible, and all the workmen suffered from headache, sickness, and cutaneous eruptions. It was a great struggle, nobly borne. They shared Brunel's anxieties, and were eager for a share of his fame, for he had inspired the humblest hodman with something of his own high impulse. <QUOTE>It was touching,</QUOTE> writes a chronicler of the tunnel, <QUOTE>to hear the men speak of Brunel.   As in their waking hours these men could have no thought but of the tunnel, so, no doubt, did the eternal subject constantly mingle with their dreams, and harass them with unreal dangers.   <num value="1">One</num> amusing instance may be mentioned. Whilst Mr. Brunel, jun., was engaged <num value="1">one</num> midnight superintending the progress of the work, he and those with him were alarmed by a sudden cry of  <Q>The water! the water!-wedges and straw here!</Q>  followed by an appalling silence. Mr. Brunel hastened to the spot, where the men were found perfectly safe. They had fallen fast <pb id="P.131" n="131"> asleep from   fatigue, and <num value="1">one</num> of them   had been evidently dreaming of a new irruption.</QUOTE> 
<P>By <datestruct VALUE="1828-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, the middle of the river had been reached, and no human life had yet been sacrificed. But, as if the evil principle had only retired to prepare for a fresh attack, a terrible crisis now came. <QUOTE>I had been in the frames,</QUOTE> says Mr. Brunel, jun., in a letter written to the directors on the fatal Saturday, <datestruct VALUE="1828-08-12"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=12>12th</day>,   <year reg=1828>1828</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>with the workmen throughout the whole night, having taken my station there at <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock. During the workings through the night no symptoms of insecurity appeared.   At <num value="6">six</num> o'clock this morning (the usual time for shifting the men) a fresh set came on to work. We began to work the ground at the west top corner of the frame. The tide had just then begun to flow, and finding the ground tolerably quiet, we proceeded by beginning at the top, and had worked about a foot downwards, when, on exposing the next <num value="6">six</num> inches, the ground swelled suddenly, and a large quantity burst through the opening thus made. This was followed instantly by a large body of water. The rush was so violent as to force the man on the spot where the burst took place out of the frame (or cell) on to the timber stage behind the frames. I was in the frame with the man; but upon the rush of the water I went into the next box,   in order to   command   a better view of the irruption; and seeing there was no possibility of their opposing the water, I   ordered all the men in the frames to retire.   All were retiring except the <num value="3">three</num> men who were with me, and they retreated with me. I did not leave the stage until those <num value="3">three</num> men were. down the ladder of the frames, when they and I proceeded about <num value="20">twenty</num> feet along the west arch of the tunnel.   At this moment the agitation of the air by the rush of the water was such as to extinguish all the lights, and the water had gained the height   of the middle of our waists. I was at that moment giving directions to the <num value="3">three</num> men, in what manner they ought to proceed in the dark to effect their escape, when they and I were knocked down and covered by a part of the timber stage. I struggled under water for some time, and at length extricated myself from the stage; and by swimming and being forced by the water, I gained the eastern arch, where I got a better footing, and was enabled, by laying hold of the railway rope, to pause a little, in the hope of encouraging the men who had been knocked down at the same time with myself. This I endeavoured to do by calling to them. Before I reached the shaft the water had risen so rapidly that I was out of my depth, and therefore swam   to the visitors' stairs, the stairs of the workmen being occupied by those who had so far escaped.   My knee was so injured by the timber stage that I could scarcely swim or get up the stairs, but <hi rend=italics>the rush of the water carried me up the shaft</hi>.   The <num value="3">three</num> men who had been knocked down with me were unable to extricate themselves, and I grieve to say they are lost, and, I believe, also <num value="2">two</num> old men and <num value="1">one</num> young man in other parts of the work.</QUOTE> 
<P>This   was a   crisis indeed.   The alarmists grew into a majority,   and the funds of the company were exhausted.     The hole in the river-bed was discoveted by the divers to be very formidable; it was oblong and perpendicular, and measured about <num value="7">seven</num> feet in length. The old mode of mending was resorted to. <num value="4000">Four thousand</num> tons of earth (chiefly clay, in bags) were employed to patch the place. The tunnel remained as substantial as ever, but the work was for <num value="7">seven</num> years suspended.   Brunel, whose   tenacity of purpose was unshakable, was almost in a state of frenzy at this accident. So far his plan had apparently failed, but the engineer's star had not yet forsaken him. In <datestruct VALUE="1835-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct>, the Government, after many applications, agreed to make some   advances for the continuation of the work, and it was once   more resumed   with energy. The progress was at <num value="1">first</num> very slow; for, of sixtysix weeks, <num value="2">two</num> feet <num value="4">four</num> inches    only per week were accomplished during the <num value="1">first</num> eighteen, <num value="3">three</num>   feet <num value="9">nine</num> inches per week during the <num value="2">second</num> eighteen, <num value="1">one</num> foot per week during the <num value="3">third</num> eighteen, and during the last   <num value="12">twelve</num> weeks only <num value="3">three</num>   feet <num value="4">four</num> inches altogether.   This will excite little surprise when   we know, says a clever writer on the subject, that the ground in front of the shield was, from excessive saturation, almost constantly in little better than a fluid state; that an entire new and artificial bed had to be formed in   the river in advance; and brought down by ingenious contrivances till it was deep enough to occupy the place of the natural soil where the excavation was to be made, and, that then there must be time allowed for its settlement, whenever the warning rush of sand and water was heard in the shield. Lastly, owing to the excavation being so much below that of any other works around the tunnel, it formed a drain and receptacle for all the water of the neighbourhood. This was ultimately remedied by the sinking of the shaft on the Wapping side. Yet it was under such circumstances that the old shield injured by the last irruption was taken away and replaced by a new <num value="1">one</num>. This was executed by Brunel without the loss of a single life. But now fresh difficulties arose: the expenditure had been so great that the Lords of the Treasury declined to make further advances without the sanction of Parliament. The <pb id="P.132" n="132"> examination of Mr. Brunel and the assistant engineers before a Parliamentary Committee led, however, to favourable results, and the work was again renewed. 
<P>In <datestruct VALUE="1837-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1837">1837</year></datestruct>, a <num value="3">third</num> irruption and several narrow escapes occurred.   The water had gradually increased at the east corner, since <measure value="2d." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> p.</measure>m. on the <num value="23">23rd</num>, rushing into the shield with a hollow roar, as though it fell through a cavity in the riverbed.   A boat was then sent into the tunnel, to convey material to block up the frames. Notwithstanding, the water gained upon the men, and rapidly rose in the tunnel. About <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> p.</measure>m., the water having risen to within <num value="7">seven</num> feet of the crown of the arch, it was thought wise for the men to retire, which they did with great courage, along 
<FIGURE id="Fig.132" n="2000.07.0050"><HEAD>A Wild-Beast Shop. (See Page <num value="134">134</num>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 a platform constructed by Mr. Brunel in the east arch only a few weeks before. As the water still continued rising, after the men left, Mr. Page, the acting engineer, and <num value="4">four</num> others, got into the boat, in order to reach the stages and see if any change had taken place; but after passing the <num value="600">600</num> feet mark in the tunnel the line attached to the boat ran out, and they returned to lengthen it. This accident saved their lives, for while they were preparing the rope the water surged up the arch <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> feet. They instantly made their way to the shaft, and Mr. Page, fearing the men might get jammed in the staircase, called to them to go steadily; but they, misunderstanding him, returned, and could hardly be prevailed upon to go up. Had the line been long enough, all the persons in the boat must <pb id="P.133" n="133"> have perished, for no less than a million gallons of water now burst into the tunnel in a single minute. The lower gas-lights were now under water, and the tunnel was almost in darkness.   The water had now risen to within <num value="50">fifty</num> feet of the entrance of the tunnel, and was advancing in a wave.   As Mr. Page and his assistants arrived at the <num value="2">second</num> landing of the visitors' stairs, the waves had risen up to the knees of the last man. 
<P>The next irruption was in <datestruct VALUE="1837-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1837">1837</year></datestruct>, when the water burst in about <num value="4">four</num> in the morning, and soon filled the tunnel. Excellent arrangements had been made for the safety of the men, and all the <num value="70">seventy</num> or more persons employed at the time escaped, but <num value="1">one</num>-he alone did not answer when the roll was called; and some <num value="1">one</num> remembered seeing a miner going towards the shield when all the rest were escaping. The <num value="5">fifth</num> and last serious irruption occurred on <datestruct VALUE="1838-03-6"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=6>6</day>, <year reg=1838>1838</year></datestruct>. It was preceded by a noise resembling thunder, but no loss of life occurred. 
<P>The last feeble struggle of the river against its persistent enemy was in <datestruct VALUE="1840-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>. About <num value="8">eight</num> a.m., it being then low water, during a movement of the poling-boards in the shield, a quantity of gravel and water rushed into the frame. The 
<FIGURE id="Fig.133" n="2000.07.0051"><HEAD>St. Dunstan's, Stepney,   (From A View Taken In <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 ground rushed in immediately, and knocked the men out of their cells, and they fled in a panic; but finding the water did not follow, they returned, and by great exertions succeeded in stopping the run, when upwards of <num value="6">6</num>,ooo cubic feet of ground had fallen into the tunnel, The fall was attended with a noise like thunder, and the extinguishing of all the lights. At the same time, to the horror of Wapping, part of the shore in that place sank, over an area of upwards of <num value="700">700</num> feet, leaving a cavity on the shore of about <num value="30">thirty</num> feet in diameter, and <num value="13">thirteen</num> feet in depth. Had this taken place at high water, the tunnel would have been filled; as it was, men were sent over with bags of clay and gravel, and everything rendered secure by the return of the tide. 
<P>Sometimes sand, nearly fluid, would ooze through minute cracks between the small poling-boards of the shield, and leave large cavities in the ground in front. On <num value="1">one</num> of these occasions the sand poured in all night, and filled the bottom of the shield. In the morning, on opening <num value="1">one</num> of the faces, a hollow was discovered, eighteen feet long, <num value="6">six</num> feet high, and <num value="6">six</num> feet deep. This cavity was filled up with brickbats and lumps of clay.   <num value="1">One</num> of the miners was compelled to lay himself down in this <pb id="P.134" n="134">

 cavity, for the purpose of building up the further end, though at the risk of being buried alive.. 
<P>At last, on the <datestruct VALUE="1841-08-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, Sir Isambard Brunel passed down the shaft on the Wapping side of the Thames, and thence, by a small drift-way through the shield, into the tunnel.   The difficulties of the great work had at last been surmounted. 
<P>The tunnel measures <num value="1200">1,200</num> feet. The carriageways were originally intended to consist of an immense spiral road, winding twice round a circular excavation <num value="57">57</num> feet deep, in order to reach the proper level. The extreme diameter of this spiral road was to be no less than <num value="200">200</num> feet. The road itself was to have been <num value="40">40</num> feet wide, and the descent very moderate. The tunnel is now turned into a part of the East London Railway, which will form, a junction between the Great Eastern Railway and the various branches of the Brighton Railway on the south of the Thames. 
<P>Ratcliff Highway, now called St. George Street, is the Regent Street of London sailors, who, in many instances, never extend their walks in the metropolis beyond   this semi-marine region. It derives its name from the manor of Ratcliffe in the parish of Stepney. Stow describes it as so increased in building eastward in   his time that, instead of a large highway, <QUOTE>with fair elm-trees on both the sides,</QUOTE> as he had known it, it had joined Limehurst or Lime host, corruptly called Limehouse, a mile distant from Ratcliffe.   In Dryden's miscellaneous poems, Tom, <num value="1">one</num> of the characters, remarks that he had heard a ballad about the Protector Somerset sung at Ratcliff Cross. 
<P>The   wild-beast shops in this street have often been sketched by modern essayists. The yards in the neighborhood are crammed with lions, hyenas, pelicans, tigers, and other animals in demand among the proprietors of menageries. As many as <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="15">fifteen</num> lions are often in stock at <num value="1">one</num> time, and sailors come here to sell their pets and barter curiosities. The ingenious way that animals are stored in these out-of-the-way places is well worth seeing. 
<P>Ratcliff Highway has not been the scene of many very memorable events.   In <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>,   however, it was startled by a series of murders that for a time struck all London with terror, and produced a deep conviction in the public mind that the old watchmen who then paraded the City were altogether insufficient to secure the safety of its inhabitants. Mr. Marr, the <num value="1">first</num> victim, kept a lace and pelisse shop at No. <num value="29">29</num>, Ratcliff Highway. At about <num value="12">twelve</num> at night on Saturday, <datestruct VALUE="1811-12-7"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=7>7</day>, <year reg=1811>1811</year></datestruct>, he sent out his servant-girl to purchase some oysters for supper, while he shut up the shop-windows. On the girl's return, in a quarter of an hour, she rang the bell, but obtained no answer. As she listened at the key-hole, she thought she could hear a person breathing at the same aperture; she therefore gave the alarm.   On the shop being broken open, Mr. Marr was found dead behind the counter, Mrs. Marr and the shop-boy dead in another part of the shop, and a child murdered in the cradle. The murderer had, it was supposed, used a ship-mallet, and had evidently come in on pretence of purchasing goods, as Marr had been reaching down some stockings when he was struck. Very little if any money was missed from the till. <datestruct value="12"><year reg="12">Twelve</year></datestruct> days after, before the horror and alarm caused by these murders could subside, other crimes followed. On the <datestruct value="12-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, Williamson, the landlord of the King's Arms public-house, Old Gravel Lane, Ratcliff Highway, with his wife, and female servant were also murdered. An apprentice who lodged at the house, coming down-stairs in alarm at hearing a door slam, saw the murderer stooping and taking the keys out of the pocket of Mrs. Williamson. The murderer heard him, and pursued him   upstairs; but the lad, fastening his sheets to a bed, let himself down out of window into the street. 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.134.2">The murderer a sailor named Williams, escaped, though the house was almost instantly surrounded; but was soon after captured at a sailors' boardinghouse, where a knife stained with blood was afterwards found secreted. The wretch hanged himself in prison the night of his arrest. His body   was placed on a platform in a high cart with the mallet and ripping chisel, with which he had committed the murders,     by his side</LEMMA>,      and driven past the houses of Marr and Williamson. A stake was then driven through his breast, and his carcase thrown into a hole dug for the purpose, where the New Road crosses and Cannon Street Road begins. 
<P>It was remembered afterwards, by a girl to whom the murderer had been attached, that he had once asked her if she should be frightened if she awoke in the night and saw him standing with a knife by her bedside. The girl replied, <QUOTE>I should feel no fear, Mr. Williams, when I saw your face.</QUOTE> Very little was discovered of the man's antecedents, but it is said that the captain of the East Indiaman in which he had sailed had predicted his speedy death by the gallows. These murders excited the imagination of De Quincey, the opium-eater, who wrote a wonderful though not strictly accurate version of the affair. Macaulay, writing of the alarm in England at the supposed murder of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, says, <QUOTE>Many of our readers can remember the state of London just after the <pb id="P.135" n="135"> murder of Marr and Williamson; the terror which was on every face; the careful barring of doors; the providing of blunderbusses and watchmen's rattles. We know of a shopkeeper who on that occasion sold <num value="300">300</num>   rattles in about <num value="10">ten</num> hours. Those who remember that panic may be able to form some notion of the state of England after the death of Godfrey.</QUOTE> 
<P>In the Swedish Church, Princes Square, Ratcliff Highway, lies buried that extraordinary man, Baron Swedenborg, founder of the sect of Swedenborgians, who died in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>.   This strange mystic, who discovered an inner meaning in the Scriptures, believed that in visions he had visited both heaven and hell; he was also a practical mineralogist of great scientific attainments. 
<P>We now come to <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.135.1">Wapping</LEMMA>, that nautical hamlet of Stepney, a long street extending from Lower East Smithfield to New Crane. It, was begun in <num value="157">157</num>I, to secure the manor from the encroachments of the river, which had turned this part of the north bank of the Thames into a great wash or swamp; the Commissioners of Sewers rightly imagining that when building once began, the tenants would not fail to keep out the river, for the sake of their own, lives and properties. Stow calls it Wappingin- the-Wose, or Wash; and Strype describes it as a place <QUOTE>chiefly inhabited by seafaring men, and tradesmen dealing in commodities for the supply of shipping and shipmen.</QUOTE> 
<P>It must have been a dirty, dangerous place in Stow's time, when it was chiefly remarkable as being the place of execution for pirates.   Stow says of it- <QUOTE>The usual place for hanging of pirates and sea-rovers, at the low-water mark, and there to remain till <num value="3">three</num> tides had overflowed them; was never a house standing within these <num value="40">forty</num> years, but since the gallows being after removed farther off, a continual street, or filthy strait passage, with alleys of small tenements or cottages built, inhabited by sailor's victuallers, along by the river of Thames, almost to Radcliffe, a good mile from the Tower.</QUOTE> 
<P>Pirates were hung at East Wapping as early as the reign of Henry VI., for in a <title>Chronicle of London,</title> edited by Sir Harris Nicolas, we read that in this reign <num value="2">two</num> bargemen were hung beyond St. Katherine's, for murdering <num value="3">three</num> Flemings and a child in a Flemish vessel; <QUOTE>and there they hengen till the water had washed them by ebbying and flowyd, so the water bett upon them.</QUOTE> And as late as <datestruct value="1735"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct> we read in the <title>Gentleman's Magazine</title>, <QUOTE>Williams the pirate was hanged at Execution Dock, and afterwards in chains at Bugsby's Hole, near Blackwall.</QUOTE> Howell, in his

<P>The audience, no doubt, sympathised with these gallant filibusters, whose forays and piracies against Spain would be thought by many present very venial offences. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct> Townsend, the celebrated Bow Street runner, was examined before a Committee of the House of Commons, on the decrease of highwaymen, and other questions connected with the police of the metropolis. He was particularly questioned as to the advantage of hanging men in chains. The sturdy old officer, with the memorable white hat, was strongly for the custom. <QUOTE>Yes,</QUOTE> he said, <QUOTE>I was always of that opinion, and I recommended Sir William Scott to hang the <num value="2">two</num> men that are hanging down the river. I will state my reason. We will take for granted that those men were hanged, as this morning, for the murder of those revenue officers. They are by law dissected. The sentence is that afterwards the body is to go to the surgeons for dissection.   There is an end of it--it dies. But look at this. There are a couple of men now hanging near the Thames, where all the sailors must come up; and <num value="1">one</num> says to the other,  <Q> Pray, what are those <num value="2">two</num> poor fellows there for?</Q>   <Q>Why,</Q>  says another,  <Q>I will go and ask.</Q>  They ask.    <Q>Why, these <num value="2">two</num> men are hung and <pb id="P.136" n="136"> gibbeted for murdering His Majesty's revenue officers.</Q>  And so the thing is kept alive.</QUOTE> 
<P>In <num value="1">one</num> of Hogarth's series of the Idle and Industrious Apprentices, the artist has introduced a man hanging in chains further down the river; and a friend of the author's remembers seeing a pirate hung in chains on the Thames bank, and a crow on his shoulder, pecking his flesh through the iron netting that enclosed the body. 
<P>Wapping, it will be remembered, was in <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct> the scene of the capture of the cruel minister of James II., Lord Chancellor Jeffreys, who, trying to make his escape in the disguise of a common seaman, was captured in a mean ale-house, called the <QUOTE>Red Cow,</QUOTE> in Anchor-and-Hope Alley, near King Edward's Stairs, in Wapping. He was recognised by a poor scrivener, whom he had once terrified when in his clutches, as he was lolling out of window, confident in his security. The story of his capture is related with much vividness and unction by Macaulay:-- 
<P> <QUOTE>A scrivener,</QUOTE> says the historian, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>who lived at Wapping, and whose trade was to furnish the seafaring men there with money at high interest, had some time before lent a sum on bottomry. The debtor applied to equity for relief against his own bond, and the case came before Jeffreys. The counsel for the borrower, having little else to say, said that the lender was a trimmer. The chancellor instantly fired.  <Q>A trimmer! Where is he? Let me see him. I have heard of that kind of monster. What is it made like?</Q>  The unfortunate creditor was forced to stand forth. The chancellor glared fiercely on him, stormed at him, and sent him away half dead with fright.  <Q> While I live,</Q>  the poor man said, as he tottered out of the court,  <Q>I shall never forget that terrible countenance.</Q>  And now the day of retribution had arrived. The trimmer was walking through Wapping, when he saw a well-known face looking out of the window of an ale-house. He could not be deceived. The eyebrows, indeed, had been shaved away. The dress was that of a common sailor from. Newcastle, and was black with coal-dust; but there was no mistaking the savage eye and mouth of Jeffreys. The alarm was given. In a moment the house was surrounded by hundreds of people, shaking bludgeons and bellowing curses. The fugitive's life was saved by a company of the Trainbands; and he was carried before the Lord Mayor. The mayor was a simple man, who had passed his whole life in obscurity, and was bewildered by finding himself an important actor in a mighty revolution.   The events of the last <num value="24">twenty-four</num> hours, and the perilous state of the city which was under his charge, had disordered his mind and his body. When the great man, at whose frown, a few days before, the whole kingdom had trembled, was dragged into the justice-room begrimed with ashes, half dead with fright, and followed by a raging multitude, the agitation of the unfortunate mayor rose to the height. He fell into fits, and was carried to his bed; whence he never rose.   Meanwhile, the throng without was constantly becoming more numerous and more savage. Jeffreys begged to be sent to prison. An order to that effect was procured from the Lords who were sitting at Whitehall; and he was conveyed in a carriage to the Tower. <num value="2">Two</num> regiments of militia were drawn out to escort him, and found the duty a difficult <num value="1">one</num>. It was repeatedly necessary for them to form, as if for the purpose of repelling a charge of cavalry, and to present a forest of pikes to the mob.   The thousands who were disappointed of their revenge pursued the coach with howls of rage to the gate of the Tower, brandishing cudgels, and holding up halters full in the prisoner's view. The wretched man meantime was in convulsions of terror. He wrung his hands, he looked wildly out, sometimes at <num value="1">one</num> window; sometimes at the other, and was heard, even above the tumult, crying,  <Q>Keep them off, gentlemen! For God's sake, keep them off!</Q>  At length, having suffered far more than the bitterness of death, he was safely lodged in the fortress, where some of his most illustrious victims had passed their last days, and where his own life was destined to close in unspeakable ignominy and terror.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Strype records the fact that on <datestruct VALUE="1629-07-24"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=24>24</day>, <year reg=1629>1629</year></datestruct>, King Charles I., having hunted a stag all the way from Wanstead, in Essex, ran him down at last, and killed him in Nightingale Lane, <QUOTE>in the hamlet of Wapping, in a garden belonging to a man who had some damage among his herbs, by reason of the multitude of people there assembled suddenly.</QUOTE>

<P>Joseph Ames, that well-known antiquary and lover of old books, who wrote <title>Typographical Antiquities; or, the History of Printing in England,</title> was a <pb id="P.137" n="137">

 ship-chandler in a humble alley of Wapping, where he died, in <datestruct value="1758--"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>. This worthy old student is described as a person of vast application and industry in collecting old printed books and prints, and other curiosities, both natural and artificial. His curious notices of Caxton's works, and of very rare early books, were edited and enlarged, <num value="1">first</num> by Herbert, and lastly by that enthusiastic bibliomaniac, T. F. Dibdin. Another celebrated native of Wapping was John Day, a block and pump maker, who originated that popular festivity, Fairlop Fair, in Hainault Forest.

<P>Going still further east we come to Shadwell, which, like Wapping, was a hamlet of Stepney, till <datestruct value="1669"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>, when it was separated by Act of Parliament. It derives its name, it is supposed by Lysons, from a spring dedicated to St. Chad. Its extent is very small, being only <num value="910">910</num> yards long, and <num value="760">760</num> broad. In Lysons' time, the only land in the parish not built on was the Sun Tavern Fields, in which were rope-walks, where cables were made, from <num value="6">six</num> to <num value="23">twenty-three</num> inches in girth; the rest of the parish was occupied by ships' chandlers, biscuit bakers, ship-builders, mast-makers, sail-makers, and anchorsmiths.   The church of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.137.2">St. Paul</LEMMA> was built in the year <datestruct value="1656"><year reg="1656">1656</year></datestruct>, but it was not consecrated till <datestruct value="1671"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>. It was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct> on the old site.

<P>About <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct> a mineral spring, which was called Shadwell Spa, was discovered by Walter Berry, Esq., when sinking a well in Sun Tavern Fields. It was said to be impregnated with sulphur, vitriol, steel, and antimony. A pamphlet was written by Dr. Linden, in <datestruct value="1749--"><year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>, to prove it could cure every disease.   The water was found useful in cutaneous diseases. It was then employed for extracting salts, and for preparing a liquor with which the calicoprinters fix their colours.   The waters of another mineral spring in Shadwell resemble those of the postern spring on Tower Hill.   Cook's almshouses at Shadwell are mentioned by the local historians.

<P>At Stepney, <num value="2">two</num> and a half miles east of St. Paul's Cathedral, we reach the eastern boundary of the radius we have defined for our work. This parish was anciently called Stibenhede, Stebenhythe, or Stebunhethe.   In <datestruct value="1299--"><year reg="1299">1299</year></datestruct>, probably because it was an out-of-the-way nook, between marshes and the river, it was the seat of a parliament summoned by Edward I. to meet at the mansion house of Henry Walleis, then Mayor of London.   At an early date the manor was held by the Bishops of London, who had a palace, called Bishop's Hall, now in the parish of Bethnal Green. In the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century John de Pulteney, who was <num value="4">four</num> times Mayor of London, owned property in this parish. From the reign of Edward I. various injunctions were made at Stepney to prevent the frequent floods from the Thames, to inquire into the state of the banks and ditches, and to prevent all negligent tenants and delinquents. 
<P>Alienated by Bishop Ridley, the manor of Stepney was given by Edward VI. to the Wentworths. From Lord Wentworth it descended to Thomas, Earl of Cleveland, whose estates were confiscated in <datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>, when Sir William Ellis, Cromwell's solicitor, was made steward of the manor, a place then valued at <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure> per annum. After the Restoration the Earl of Cleveland recovered his manor, which continued in his family till the year <datestruct value="1720"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, when <pb id="P.138" n="138"> it was sold by the representatives of Philadelphia, Lady Wentworth, to John Wicker, Esq., whose son alienated it to his brother-in-law Sir George Colebrooke in the year <datestruct value="1754"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1664--"><year reg="1664">1664</year></datestruct>, Charles II., at the Earl of Cleveland's request, instituted a weekly court of record at Stepney, and a weekly market at Ratcliffe Cross (afterwards transferred to Whitechapel), and an annual Michaelmas fair at Mile End Green (afterwards transferred to Bow). In the <num value="1">first</num> year of Charles I., Stepney was ravaged by the plague, which had broken out from time to time in London since Elizabeth's reign. This terrible disease carried off here <num value="2978">2,978</num> persons. At the commencement of the Civil War, Stepney, then a mere flat, extending to Blackwall, was strongly fortified for the defence of the City. In <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct> the plague again broke out in Stepney, and with such terrible inveteracy that it swept off <num value="6583">6,583</num> persons in <num value="1">one</num> year, besides <num value="116">116</num> sextons and gravediggers.   In <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct> a fire consumed more than half the hamlet of Ratcliffe, and spread to the shipping in the river. Stepney had a traditional reputation for healthiness till the cholera of <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>, when many cases occurred in the neighbourhood.

This coat of arms   has given rise to a tradition that Lady Berry was the heroine of a popular ballad called  <Q>The Cruel Knight; or, Fortunate Farmer's Daughter;</Q>  the story of which is briefly this:--A knight, passing by a cottage hears the cries of a woman in labour; his knowledge in the occult sciences informs him that the child   then born was destined to be  his  wife.   He endeavours to elude the decrees of fate, and avoid so ignoble an alliance, by various attempts to destroy the child, which are defeated.   At length, when grown to woman's state, he takes her to the     sea-side, intending to drown her, but relents; at the same time throwing   a ring into the sea, he commands     her never   to see his face again,   on pain of instant death, unless she can   produce that ring. She afterwards becomes a cook, and finds the ring in a cod-fish, as she is dressing it for dinner.   The marriage   takes place, of course.   The ballad, it must be observed, lays the scene of this story in Yorkshire. The incident of the fish and ring occurs in other stories, and may be found in the  <Q>Arabian Nights' Entertainments.</Q> </QUOTE>

<P>This celebrated   officer was son   of Captain Richard Leake, Master Gunner of England; he was born at Rotherhithe, in the year <datestruct value="1656"><year reg="1656">1656</year></datestruct>.

In Queen Anne's reign he was <num value="5">five</num> times Admiral of the Fleet, and commanded with such undeviating success, that he acquired the appellation of <QUOTE>the brave and fortunate.</QUOTE> On the accession of George I. he was dismissed from: all employ, and retired into private life.   The veteran died in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, and was buried in a family vault in Stepney Church. His son, Captain Richard Leake, who died a few months before him, seems to have been a worthless profligate, who married disgracefully, ran through his money, and then lived on his father. His nativity had, it is said, been cast by his grandfather, who pronounced that he would be very vicious, very fortunate, so far as prize-money was concerned, and very unhappy. 
<P>The living of Stepney was held by Archbishop Segrave and Bishop Fox (the founder of Corpus Christi College, Oxford). Of the Stepney district churches St. Philip's is said to have been the <num value="1">first</num> district Gothic church built in the east of London. It was erected in <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, at a cost of &pound;,<num value="7000">7,000</num>. There is also a synagogue and Jews' burial-ground at Stepney, and numerous almshouses and hospitals, such as Deacon's City Paupers' House, the German and Portuguese Jews' Hospitals, Drapers' Hospital, Trinity Almshouses, Gibson's, or Cooper's Almshouses. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1372--"><year reg="1372">1372</year></datestruct> the rectory of Stepney was valued at <measure value="60bmark" type=currency><num value="60">sixty</num> marks</measure> a year, and the vicarage at <num value="12">twelve</num>. In the Parliamentary survey, taken in <datestruct value="1650--"><year reg="1650">1650</year></datestruct>, the vicarage is set down at the value of <measure value="70l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="70">70</num></measure> per annum. The ancient rectory stood near the east end of the church; and in Lysons' time the brick wall which enclosed the site still remained. 
<P>Colet, the founder of   St. Paul's School, and the sworn friend of Erasmus, was vicar here, and still resided in Stepney after being made Dean of St. Paul's.   Sir Thomas More, writing to him, then abroad, says, <QUOTE>If the discommodities of the City offend you, yet may the country about your parish of Stepney afford you the like delights to those which that affords you wherein you now keepe.</QUOTE> The dean's house was at the north end of White Horse Street, Ratcliffe.   Upon his founding St. Paul's School he gave it to the head-master as a country residence; but Stepney having in a great <pb id="P.141" n="141"> measure lost its rural delights, the masters have not resided there for many years. The site (now <num value="2">two</num> messuages called Colet Place) was, in Lysons' time, still let for their advantage. In the front was a bust of the dean. 
<P>Richard Pace, who was presented to the vicarage in <datestruct value="1519--"><year reg="1519">1519</year></datestruct>, had been in the service of Cardinal Bainbridge, who having recommended him at Court, the king had made him   Secretary of State, and employed him in matters of the highest importance. He was afterwards made Dean of St. Paul's, but kept the vicarage till <datestruct value="1527"><year reg="1527">1527</year></datestruct>, when he was sent as ambassador to Venice.   Whilst there he either thwarted some plan of Wolsey's, or did not lend himself enough to the ambitious schemes of that proud cardinal, for he fell into disgrace, and at his return was thrown into the Tower for <num value="2">two</num> years. These misfortunes affected his brain, and he suffered from mental disease, from which he never wholly recovered. After his release he retired to Stepney, where he died in <datestruct value="1532--"><year reg="1532">1532</year></datestruct>, and was buried in the church, near the great altar. Erasmus, who was a friend of Pace's, speaks highly of his amiable character, his pleasant manner, and his integrity. He wrote a book on the unlawfulness of King Henry's   marriage with the widow of his brother Arthur, a Preface   to Ecclesiastes,   and some Latin epistles and sermons. William Jerome, presented to the vicarage of Stepney in <datestruct value="1537--"><year reg="1537">1537</year></datestruct>, was executed in <datestruct value="1540--"><year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct> on a charge of heresy. 
<P>Roger Crab, gent., <num value="1">one</num> of the old celebrities of Bethnal Green, and who was buried at Stepney, <datestruct VALUE="1680-09-14"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=14>14</day>, <year reg=1680>1680</year></datestruct>, was <num value="1">one</num> of the eccentric characters of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. The most we know of him is from a pamphlet, now very rare, written principally by himself, and entitled, <title>The English Hermit; or, the Wonder of the Age.</title>   It appears from   this publication that he had served <num value="7">seven</num> years in the Parliamentary army, and had his skull cloven to the brain in their service; for which he was so ill requited that he was once sentenced to death by the Lord Protector, and afterwards suffered <num value="2">two</num> years' imprisonment. When he had obtained his release he set up a shop at Chesham as a haberdasher of hats.   He had not been long settled there before he began to imbibe a strange notion, that it was a sin against his body and soul to eat any sort of flesh, fish, or living creature, or to drink wine, ale, or beer. Thinking himself at the same time obliged to follow literally the injunction to the young man in the Gospel, he quitted business, and disposing of his property, gave it to the poor, reserving to himself only a small cottage at Ickenham, where he resided and a rood   of land for a garden, on the produce of which he subsisted at the expense of <num value="3">three</num> farthings a week, his food being bran, herbs, roots, dockleaves, mallows, and grass; his drink, water. How such an extraordinary change of diet agreed with his constitution the following passage from his pamphlet will show, and give, at the same time, a specimen of the work :-- <QUOTE>Instead of strong drinks and wines, I give the old man a cup of water; and instead of rost mutton and rabbets, and other dainty dishes, I give him broth thickened with bran, and pudding made with   bran and turnip-leaves chopt together, and grass; at which the old man (meaning my body), being moved, would know what he had done, that I used him so hardly; then I show'd him his transgression: so the warres began; the law of the old man in my fleshly members rebelled against the law of my mind, and had a shrewd skirmish ; but the mind, being well enlightened, held it so that the old man grew sick and weak with the flux, like to fall to the dust; but the wonderful love of God, well pleased with the battle, raised him up again, and filled him full of love, peace, and content of mind, and he is now become more humble; for now he will eat dock-leaves, mallows, or grass.</QUOTE> The pamphlet was published in <datestruct value="1655--"><year reg="1655">1655</year></datestruct>. Prefixed to it is

<P>A passage in this man's epitaph seems to intimate that he never resumed the use of animal food. It is not <num value="1">one</num> of the least extraordinary parts of his history that he should so long have subsisted on a diet which, by his own account, had reduced him almost to a skeleton in <datestruct value="1655--"><year reg="1655">1655</year></datestruct>. It appears that he resided at Bethnal Green at the time of his decease. A very handsome tomb was erected to his memory in the churchyard   at this place, which being decayed, the ledger-stone was placed in the pathway leading across the churchyard to White Horse Street.   Strype says of the man, <QUOTE>This Crab, they say, was a Philadelphian, a sweet singer.</QUOTE> 
<P>A   congregation of Protestant Dissenters Was established in Stepney in the year <datestruct value="1644"><year reg="1644">1644</year></datestruct> by William Greenhill, who was afterwards vicar of Stepney. He was ejected soon after the Restoration, and was succeeded by Matthew Mead. This eminent Puritan divine was appointed to the cure of the new chapel at Shadwell by Cromwell, but in <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, being ejected for nonconformity, succeeded Greenhill as pastor of the Dissenting congregation at Stepney.   In <datestruct value="1683--"><year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>, being accused of being privy to the Rye House Plot, he fled   to Holland till the <pb id="P.142" n="142"> danger was over.

Dr. Mead died in the year <datestruct value="1754"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>, and was buried in the Temple Church.

<P> <QUOTE>Whitechapel,</QUOTE> says Strype, <QUOTE>is a spacious fair street, for entrance into the City eastward, and somewhat long, reckoning from   the laystall east unto the bars west. It is a great thoroughfare, being the Essex road, and well resorted unto, which occasions it to be the better inhabited, and accommodated with good inns for the reception of travellers, and for horses, coaches, carts, and wagons.</QUOTE>

<P> <QUOTE>I lived,</QUOTE> says Defoe, in his <title>Memoirs of the Plague,</title> <QUOTE>without Aldgate, about midway between Aldgate Church and Whitechapel Bars, on the lefthand or north side of the street; and as the distemper had not reached to that side of the City, our neighbourhood continued very easy; but at the other end of the town the consternation was very great, and the richer sort of people, especially the nobility   and   gentry from   the west part of the City, thronged out of town with their families and   servants in   an   unusual manner; and this was more particularly seen in Whitechapel--that is to say, the broad street where I lived.</QUOTE> 
<P>Although <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.143.1">the church of St. Mary, Whitechapel</LEMMA>, was at <num value="1">first</num> only a cape or ease to Stepney, it is of great antiquity, since there is record of Hugh de Fulbourne being rector there in the year <datestruct value="1329"><year reg="1329">1329</year></datestruct>.   As <pb id="P.143" n="143"> early as the <num value="21">21st</num> of Richard II., according to Stow, the parish was   called Villa beatae Mariae de Matfellon, a name the strangeness of which has given rise to many Whitechapel legends. According to Stow, the name of Matfellon was given it about the year <datestruct value="1428"><year reg="1428">1428</year></datestruct> (<num value="6">6th</num> Henry VI.),   from the following circumstance :----A devout widow of the parish had long time cherished and brought up of alms a certain   Frenchman or Breton born, who most <QUOTE>unkindly and cruelly,</QUOTE> by night, murdered the said widow as she slept in her bed and afterwards flew with such jewels and other stuff of hers as   he might carry; but was so freshly pursued, that for fear he took sanctuary in the church of   St. George, Southwark, and challenging the privileges there, abjured the king's land.   Then the constables in charge of him brought him into London to convey him eastward,   but as soon as he was come into Whitechapel, the wives there cast upon him so many missiles and so much filth, that notwithstanding all the resistance of the constables, they slew him out   of hand; and for this feat, it was said, the parish purchased the name of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.143.2">St. Mary Matfellon</LEMMA>. 
<P>Now, that this event may have occurred in the reign of Henry VI. is   very probable; but as the parish was called Matfellon more than a <num value="100">hundred</num> years before, it is very certain that the name of Matfellon did not arise from this particular felon. Strype   thinks that the word Matfellon is somehow or other derived from the Hebrew or Syriac word <QUOTE>Matfel,</QUOTE> which signifies a woman recently delivered of a son--that is, to the Virgin, recently delivered. Perhaps   the church may have been dedicated   to Mary matri et filio, which in time was corrupted into Matfellon.   The name of the White Chapel was probably given the new chapel in admiration of its stateliness, or from the whitewash that even in the Middle Ages was frequently used by   builders. 
<P>The inhabitants of this parish, says Strype, were anciently bound, annually, at the feast of Pentecost, to go in a solemn procession to the cathedral church of St. Paul's, in the City of London, to make their oblations, as a testimony of their obedience to the Mother Church; but upon the erection of the conventual church of St. Peter, Westminster, into a cathedral, and. the county of Middlesex appropriated by Henry VIII. for its diocese, of which this parish being a part, the inhabitants were obliged to repair annually to St. Peter's, as they formerly did to St. Paul's; which practice proving very troublesome, and   of no service, Thomas Thirlby, bishop of the new see; upon their petition, agreed to ease them of that trouble,   provided the rector and churchwardens would yearly, at the time accustomed, repair to his new cathedral, and    there, in the time of Divine service, offer at the high altar the sum of <measure value="15d." type=currency><num value="15">fifteen</num> pence</measure>, as a recognition of their obedience. 
<P>The street, or way, says   Strype, leading from Aldgate to Whitechapel Church, remaining in its original unpaved state, it became thereby so very bad that the same was almost rendered impassable, not only for carriages,   but   likewise for   horses; wherefore it, together with divers others on the west side of the City of London, were appointed to be paved by an Act of Parliament, in the year <datestruct value="1572"><year reg="1572">1572</year></datestruct>. 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1711"><year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct> the advowson   of Whitechapel was purchased   by   the principal and scholars of King's Hall and College of Brasenose College,   in Oxford. 
<P>Pennant, always vivacious and amusing, tells a story of a libellous picture   of the Last Supper placed above   the altar in this church, in the reign of Queen Anne,   by the then High   Church rector. Dr. White Kennet, at that time Dean of Peterborough,   had given great offense to <hi rend=italics>the Jacobites,</hi>
 by writing in defence of the Hanoverian succession, and in revenge the rector introduced the dean among the Apostles in the character of Judas.   He clad him in a black robe, between cloak and gown, and a short wig, and, to brand him beyond mistake, put a black velvet patch on his forehead, such as the dean wore to hide a dreadful injury received in his youth; beneath was written, <QUOTE>Judas, the traytor.</QUOTE> The dean generously treated the matter with contemptuous silence;   but the Bishop of London interfered, and   caused the obnoxious picture to be removed. It was afterwards replaced, but the libellous likeness was expunged. 
<P>The register of St. Mary Matfellon, Whitechapel, records the burial of   <num value="2">two</num>   remarkable persons- Brandon, the supposed executioner of Charles I., and Parker, the, leader of the Mutiny at the Nore. Brandon was a ragman, in Rosemary Lane. The ntry is-- <QUOTE><datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>. <datestruct value="06-2"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=2>2</day></datestruct>.

He took an orange, stuck with cloves, and a handkerchief, out of the kings pocket,   when the body was removed from the   scaffold.   For, the orange he was offered <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure> by a gentleman in Whitehall, but he refused the sum; and afterwards sold the orange for <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure>, in Rosemary Lane.

 Gregory Brandon, and claimed the headman's axe by inheritance. The <num value="1">first</num> person he had beheaded was the Earl of Strafford; but, after all, there is still doubts as to who struck the death-blow at King Charles, and some say it was that Cornet Joyce who once arrested the king. There is as much, perhaps, to be said for Brandon, of Rosemary Lane, as any <num value="1">one</num>. 
<P>Rosemary Lane, now re-christened Royal Mint Street, is described by Mr. Mayhew as chiefly inhabited by dredgers, ballast-heavers, coal-whippers, watermen, lumpers, &amp;c., as well as the slop-workers and <QUOTE>sweaters</QUOTE> employed in the Minories. 
<P> <QUOTE><num value="1">One</num> side of the lane,</QUOTE> says Mayhew, in his 
<title>London Labour,</title> <QUOTE>is covered with old boots and shoes; old clothes, both men's, women's, and children's; new lace, for edgings, and a variety of cheap prints and muslins, and often of the commonest kinds (also new); hats and bonnets; pots; tins; old knives and forks, old scissors, and old metal articles generally; here and there is a stall of cheap bread or American cheese, or what is announced as American; old glass; different descriptions of <num value="2">second</num>-hand furniture, of the smaller size, such as children's chairs, bellows, &amp;c. Mixed with these, but only very scantily, are a few brightlooking swag-barrows, with china ornaments, toys, &amp;c. Some of the wares are spread on the ground, on wrappers, or pieces of matting or carpet; and some, as the pots, are occasionally placed on straw. The cotton prints are often heaped on the ground, where are also ranges or heaps of boots and shoes, and piles of old clothes, or hats or umbrellas. Other trades place their goods on stalls or barrows, or over an old chair or clothes-horse. And amidst all this motley display the buyers and sellers smoke, and shout, and doze, and bargain, and wrangle, and eat, and drink tea and coffee, and sometimes beer.</QUOTE> 
<P>Rag Fair, or Rosemary Lane, Wellclose Square, is mentioned in a note to Pope's <title>Dunciad,</title> as <QUOTE>a place near the Tower of London, where old clothes and frippery are sold.</QUOTE> Pennant gives a humorous picture of the barter going on there, and says, <QUOTE>The articles of commerce by no means belie the name.

<P>In the <title>Public Advertiser</title> of <datestruct VALUE="1756-02-7"><month reg="02">Feb.</month>   <day reg=7>7</day>, <year reg=1756>1756</year></datestruct>, there is an account of <num value="1">one</num> Mary Jenkins, a dealer in old clothes in Rag Fair, selling a pair of breeches to a poor woman for sevenpence and a pint of beer.

<P>Petticoat Lane, according to Stow, was formerly called Hog Lane. It is now called Middlesex Street. The old historian gives a pleasant picture of it as it was <num value="40">forty</num> years before he wrote. <QUOTE>This Hog Lane stretcheth north towards St. Mary Spittle,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>without Bishopsgate, and within these <num value="40">forty</num> years it had on both sides fair hedgerows of elm-trees, with bridges, and easy stiles to pass over into--the pleasant fields, very commodious for citizens therein to walk about, and otherwise to recreate and refresh their dull spirits in the sweet and wholesome air which is now within a few   years made a continual building throughout of garden-houses and small cottages; and the fields on either side be turned into gardenplots, tenter-yards, bowling-alleys, and such like.</QUOTE> 
<P>Strype says that some gentlemen of the Court and City built their houses here for the sake of the fresh air. At the west of the lane, the same historian mentions, there was a house called, in Strype's boyhood, the Spanish ambassador's, who in the reign of James I. dwelt there, probably the famous Gondomar. A little way from this, down a paved alley on the east side, Strype's father lived, in a fair large house with a good garden before it, where Hans Jacobson, King James's jeweller, had dwelt. After that, French Protestant silk-weavers settled in the part of the lane towards Spittlefields, and it soon became a continuous row of buildings on both sides of the way. 
<P> <QUOTE>Petticoat Lane,</QUOTE> says Mr. Mayhew, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>is essentially the old clothes' district. Embracing the streets and alleys adjacent to Petticoat Lane, and including the rows of old boots and shoes on the ground, there is, perhaps, between <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="3">three</num> miles of old clothes.   Petticoat Lane proper is long and narrow, and to look down it is to look down a vista of many-coloured garments, alike on the sides and on the ground.   The effect sometimes is very striking, from the variety of hues, and the constant flitting or gathering of the crowd into little groups of bargainers. Gowns of every shade and every pattern are hanging up, but none, perhaps. look either bright or white; it is a <pb id="P.145" n="145"> vista of dinginess, but many-coloured dinginess, as regards female attire. Dress-coats, frock-coats, great-coats, livery and gamekeepers' coats, paletots, tunics, trowsers, knee-breeches, waistcoats, capes, pilot coats, working jackets, plaids, hats, dressinggowns, shirts, Guernsey frocks, are all displayed. The predominant colours are black and blue, but there is every colour; the light drab of some aristocratic livery, the dull brown-green of velveteen, the deep blue of a pilot-jacket, the variegated figures of the shawl dressing-gown, the glossy black of the restored garments, the shine of newly-turpentined black satin waistcoats, the scarlet and green of some flaming tartan-these things, mixed with the hues of the women's garments, spotted and striped, certainly present a scene which cannot be beheld in any other part of the greatest City in the world, nor in any other portion of the world itself. 
<P>The ground has also its array of colours. It is covered with lines of boots and shoes, their shining black relieved here and there by the admixture of females' boots, with drab, green, plum, or lavendercoloured  <Q>legs,</Q>  as the upper part of the boot is always called in the trade. There is, too, an admixture of men's  <Q>button-boots,</Q>  with drab-cloth legs; and of a few red, yellow, and russet-coloured slippers; and of children's coloured morocco boots <num value="61">61</num>

Black and drab and straw hats are hung up, or piled <num value="1">one</num> upon another, and kept from falling by means of strings; while incessantly threading their way through all this intricacy is a mass of people, some of whose dresses speak of a recent purchase in the lane.</QUOTE>

<P>According to Mr. Lysons, Bethnal Green probably derives its name from the old family of the Bathons, who had possessions in Stepney in the reign of Edward I. 
<P>The old ballad of <title>the Beggar of Bethnal Green,</title> written in the reign of Elizabeth, records the popular local legend of the concealment under this disguise of Henry de Montford, son of the

He was wounded at Evesham, fighting by his father's side, and was found among the dead by a baron's daughter, who sold her jewels to marry him, and assumed with him a beggar's attire, to preserve his life. Their only child, a daughter, was the <QUOTE>Pretty Bessie</QUOTE> of the ballad in Percy.

<P>The sign-posts at Bethnal Green have for centuries preserved the memory of this story; the beadles' staffs were adorned in accordance with the ballad; and the inhabitants, in the early part of the century, used to boldly point out an ancient house on the Green as the palace of the Blind Beggar, and show <num value="2">two</num> special turrets as the places where he deposited his gains. 
<P>This old house, called in the Survey of <datestruct value="1703--"><year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct> Bethnal Green House, was in reality built in the reign of Elizabeth by John Kirby, a rich London citizen. He was ridiculed at the time for his extravagance, in some rhymes which classed him with other similar builders, and which ranked Kirby's Castle with <QUOTE>Fisher's Folly, Spinila's Pleasure, and Megse's Glory.</QUOTE> It was eventually turned into a madhouse.   Sir Richard Gresham, father of the builder of the Royal Exchange, was a frequent resident at Bethnal Green. 
<P>The opening, in <datestruct value="1872--"><year reg="1872">1872</year></datestruct>, of an Eastern branch of the South Kensington Museum at Bethnal Green was the result of the untiring efforts of Mr. Cole, aided by Sir Antonio Brady, the Rev. Septimus Hansard, rector of Bethnal Green, and Mr. Clabon, Dr. Millar, and other gentlemen interested in the district, and was crowned with success by the princely liberality of Sir Richard Wallace (the inheritor of the Marquis of Hertford's <num value="30">thirty</num> years' collection of art treasures), who offered to the education committee the loan of all his pictures and many other works of art. The Prince and Princess of Wales were present at the opening of the Museum, which took place <datestruct VALUE="1872-06-24"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=24>24</day>, <year reg=1872>1872</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Sir Richard Wallace's collection, which occupied the whole of the upper galleries, comprised not only an assemblage of ancient and modern paintings in oil, by the greatest masters of past or modern times; a beautiful gallery of water-colour drawings, miniatures, and enamels by French, German, and British artists, but also some fine specimens of bronzes, art porcelain and pottery, statuary, snuffboxes, decorative furniture, and jewellers' and goldsmiths' work.   The collection was strongest in Dutch and modern French pictures.   Cuyp was represented by <num value="11">eleven</num> pictures, Hobbema by <num value="5">five</num>, Maes by <num value="4">four</num>, Metzu by <num value="6">six</num>, Mieris by <num value="9">nine</num>, Netscher by <num value="4">four</num>, Jan Steen by <num value="4">four</num>, Teniers by <num value="5">five</num>, Vanderneer by <num value="6">six</num>, A. Vandevelde by <num value="3">three</num>, W. Vandevelde by <num value="8">eight</num>, Philip Wouvermans by <num value="5">five</num>, Rubens by <num value="11">eleven</num>, Rembrandt by <num value="11">eleven</num>, Vandyck by <num value="6">six</num>. In the Italian school the collection was deficient in early masters, but there were excellent specimens of Da Vinci, Andrea del Sarto, Carlo Dolce, and Canaletto. Of the Spanish school there were fine specimens of Murillo and Velasquez. The French school was well represented-Greuze by twentytwo works, Watteau by <num value="11">eleven</num>, Boucher by <num value="11">eleven</num>, Lancret by <num value="9">nine</num>, and Fragonard by <num value="5">five</num>. There were <num value="41">forty-one</num> works by Horace Vernet, <num value="13">thirteen</num> by Bellange, <num value="4">four</num> by Pils, <num value="15">fifteen</num> by Delaroche, <num value="5">five</num> by Ary Scheffer, <num value="2">two</num> by Delacroix, <num value="2">two</num> by Robert Fleury, <num value="5">five</num> by Gericault, <num value="6">six</num> by Prud'hon, <num value="12">twelve</num> by Roqueplan, <num value="31">thirty-one</num> by Decamps, and <num value="15">fifteen</num> by Meissonier. 
<P>In the English collection Sir Joshua Reynolds stood pre-eminent.      His matchless portrait of 
<title>Nelly O&lsquo;Brien</title> stood out as beautiful and bewitching as ever, though the finer carnations had to some extent flown. The childish innocence of the <title>Strawberry Girl</title> found thousands of admirers, though the picture has faded to a disastrous degree; and <title>Love me, Love my Dog,</title> had crowds of East-end admirers. 
<P>Among the superb portraits by Reynolds, in his most florid manner, <title>Lady Elizabeth Seymour-Conway,</title> and <title>Frances Countess of Lincoln,</title>
 daughters of the <num value="1">first</num> Marquis of Hertford, and <num value="1">one</num> of <title>Mrs. Hoare and Son</title> (a masterpiece), were the most popular. The mildness and dignity of Reynolds was supplemented by the ineffable grace and charm of Gainsborough. Novices in art were astonished at the <hi rend=italics>naivete</hi> of <title>Miss Haverfield,</title>
 <num value="1">one</num> of the most delightful child-portraits ever painted.   The fine works of Bonington, a painter of genius little known, astonished those who were ignorant of his works.   Among his finest productions at Bethnal Green were <title>The Ducal Palace at Venice,</title> <title>The Earl of Surrey and the Fair Geraldine,</title> and <title>Henri IV. of France and the Spanish Ambassador.</title>   This king, to the horror of the proud hidalgo, is carrying his children pick-a-back. 
<P>Among the French pictures there were <num value="11">eleven</num> <num value="1">first</num>-rate Bouchers. This <hi rend=italics>protege</hi> of Madame de Pompadour was a great favourite with the Marquis, <pb id="P.148" n="148"> and at Bethnal Green <num value="1">one</num> saw him   at his best. There was a portrait of <title>The Pompadour,</title> quite coquettishly innocent, and those well-known pictures, <title>The Sleeping Shepherdess,</title> the <title>Amphitrite,</title> and the <title>Jupiter disguised as Diana.</title>
 <num value="3">Three</num> sacred pictures by Philippe de Champagne, showed us French religious art of the most ascetic kind, presenting a striking contrast to the gaiety and license of French art in general. In Greuze we find the affected simplicity and the forced sentiment of the age before the Revolution in its most graceful form. <title>The Bacchante,</title> <title>The Broken Mirror,</title> <title>The Broken Eggs,</title> and the peerless portrait of <title>Sophie Arnould,</title> enabled even those unacquainted with the charm of this painter to appreciate his merits.

<P>The original Priory of St. Mary Spittle was founded by Walter Brune and Rosia his wife, in the year <datestruct value="1197"><year reg="1197">1197</year></datestruct>. It was surrendered at the dissolution to King Henry, and at that time the hospital which belonged to the priory was found to contain <num value="180">one hundred and eighty</num> beds. In place of the hospital many large mansions were built, and among these Strype especially mentions that of Sir Horatio Pallavicini, an Italian merchant, who acted as ambassador to   Queen Elizabeth; and in the reign of James I. we find the Austrian ambassador lodging there. 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1559"><year reg="1559">1559</year></datestruct> Queen Elizabeth came in state from St. Mary Spittle, attended by a <num value="1000">thousand</num> men in harness, and <num value="10">ten</num> great guns, with drums, flutes, and trumpets sounding, and morris-dancers bringing <num value="2">two</num> white bears in a cart. 
<P>Long after the dissolution a portion of the large churchyard of the hospital remained, with a pulpit cross within a walled enclosure, at which cross, on certain days every Easter, sermons were preached. Opposite that pulpit was a small <num value="2">two</num>-storeyed building, where the alderman and sheriffs came to hear the sermons, with their ladies at a window over them. Foxe, in his <title>Book of Martyrs,</title> repeatedly mentions these Spital sermons. 
<P>The preaching at the Spittle seems to have been a custom of great antiquity. It is said that Dr. Barrow once preached a sermon on charity at the Spittle, before the Lord Mayor and aldermen, which occupied <num value="3">three</num> hours and a half. Being asked, after he came down from the pulpit, if he was not tired, <QUOTE>Yes, indeed,</QUOTE> said he, <QUOTE>I began to be weary with standing so long.</QUOTE> 
<P>In <datestruct value="1594--"><year reg="1594">1594</year></datestruct> a gallery was built near the pulpit for the governor and children of Christ's Hospital; and in <datestruct value="1617--"><year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct> we find many of the Lords of King James's Privy Council attending the Spital sermons, and afterwards dining with the Lord Mayor, at a most liberal and bountiful dinner at Billingsgate. 
<P> <QUOTE>It appears,</QUOTE> says Bingham, speaking of the Spital sermons, <QUOTE>it was usual in those times that on Good Friday a divine of eminence should, by appointment, expatiate on Christ's passion, in a sermon at Paul's Cross; on the <num value="3">three</num> days next Easter, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, a bishop, a dean, and a doctor of divinity, should preach at the Spital concerning the resurrection; and on Low Sunday another learned divine was to rehearse the substance of the other <num value="4">four</num>, in a <num value="5">fifth</num> sermon. At this the Lord Mayor and Corporation always attended, robed in violet gowns, on Good Friday and Easter Wednesday, and on the other days in scarlet.   This custom   continued till the great rebellion, in <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>, when it was discontinued. However, it was revived after the Restoration, except that instead of being preached at Paul's Cross, which had been demolished, the sermons were in the choir of the cathedral. After the Great Fire they were discontinued, both at St. Paul's Church and at the Spital, and the Easter sermons were delivered at some appointed church, and at last at St. Bridget's, in Fleet Street, where they continued invariably till the late repairs of that church, when they were removed to <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.149.1">Christ Church, Newgate Street</LEMMA>, where they still continue.</QUOTE> 
<P>In <datestruct value="1576--"><year reg="1576">1576</year></datestruct>, says Stow, in treating of a brick-field near the Spital churchyard, there were discovered many Roman funeral urns, containing copper coins of Claudius, Vespasian, Nero, Antoninus Pius, and <pb id="P.150" n="150"> Trajan, lachrymatories, Samian ware lamps, and small images, also Saxon stone coffins. Dr. Carrsatmalsa found there a skull, which he believed, to be a giant's, though others took it for an elephant's. Some of these stone coffins are still preserved in the vaults of Christ Church. 
<P>Bagford, in Leland's <title>Collectanea,</title> mentions the Priory of St. Mary Spittle as then standing, strongly built of timber, with a turret at <num value="1">one</num> angle. Its ruins, says Mr. Timbs, were discovered early in the last century, north of Spital Square. The pulpit, destroyed during the Civil Wars, stood at the north-east corner of the square. In the map of Elizabeth's reign the Spittle Fields are at the north-east extremity of London, with only a few houses on the site of the Spital.   A map published a century later shows, a square field bounded with houses, with the old artillery-ground, which had formerly belonged to the priory, on the west. Culpeper, the famous herbalist, occupied a house then in the fields, and subsequently a public-house at the corner of Red Lion Court. 
<P>This is the great district for silk-weavers. <QUOTE>Spital Square,</QUOTE> says Mr. Timbs, <QUOTE>at the south-east corner, has been the heart of the silk district since  <Q>the poor Protestant strangers, Walloons and French,</Q>  driven from France by the revocation of the Edict

 of Nantes, settled here, and thus founded the silk manufacture in England; introducing the weaving of lustrings, alamodes, brocades, satins, paduasoys, ducapes, and black velvets.   In <datestruct value="1713--"><year reg="1713">1713</year></datestruct> it was stated that silks, gold and silver stuffs, and ribbons were made here, as good as those of French fabric, and that black silk for hoods and scarves was made actually worth <measure value="300000l." type=currency><num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure>. During the reigns of Queen Anne, George I., and George II., the Spitalfields weavers greatly increased; in <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>, <num value="50000">50,000</num> persons were entirely dependent on the silk-manufacture, and the looms varied from   <num value="14000">14,000</num> to <num value="17000">17,000</num>.   Of these great numbers are often unemployed; and the distribution of funds raised for their relief has attracted to Spitalfields a great number of poor persons, and thus pauperised the district.   The earnings of weavers, in <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>, did not exceed <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure> per week, working <num value="14">fourteen</num> to <num value="16">sixteen</num> hours a day. The weaving is either the richest, or the thinnest and poorest. The weavers are principally English, and of English origin, but the manufacturers, or masters, are of French extraction, and the Guillebauds, the Desormeaux, the Chabots, the Turquands, the Mercerons, and the Chauvets trace their connection with the refugees of <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>. Many translated their names into English, by which the old families may still be known: thus, the Lemaitres called themselves Masters; the Leroys, King; the Tonneliers, Coopers; the Lejeunes, Young; the Leblancs, White; the Lenoirs, Black; the Loiseaux, Bird.</QUOTE> <pb id="P.151" n="151">

<P>Riots among the Spitalfields weavers, for many a century, were of frequent occurrence. Any decline of prices, or opposition in trade, set these turbulent workmen in a state of violent effervescence. At <num value="1">one</num> time they sallied out in parties, and tore off the calico gowns from every woman they met. Perhaps the greatest riot was in <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, when, on the occasion of the king going to Parliament to give his assent to the Regency Bill, they formed a great procession, headed by red flags and black banners, to present a petition to the House, complaining that they were reduced to starvation by the importation of French silks.   They terrified the House of Lords into an adjournment, insulted several hostile members, and in the evening attacked Bedford House, and tried to pull down the walls, declaring that the duke had been bribed to make the treaty of Fontainebleau, which had brought French silks and poverty into the land. The Riot Act was then read, and detachments of the Guards called out. The mob then fled, many being much hurt and trampled on. At a yet later date mobs of Spitalfields weavers used to break into houses and cut the looms of men who were working with improved machinery. Many outrages were committed by these <QUOTE>cutters,</QUOTE> and many lives lost in scuffles and fights. 
<P>The older houses inhabited by the weavers have wide latticed windows in the upper storeys, to light the looms.   Being nearly all bird-fanciers, the weavers supply London with singing-birds, and half the linnets, woodlarks, goldfinches, and greenfinches sold in the metropolis are caught by Spitalfields weavers in October and March.

<P>Spitalfields weavers are said to have extremely small heads, <num value="6.50">6 1/2</num> or <num value="6.75">6 3/4</num> inches being the prevailing width, although the average size of the male head in England is <num value="7">7</num> inches.

<P>Bishopsgate, according to Stow, was probably built by good Bishop Erkenwald, son of King Offa, and repaired by Bishop William, the Norman, in the reign of the Conqueror. Henry III. confirmed to merchants of the Hanse certain privileges by which they were bound to keep Bishopsgate in repair, and in the reign of Edward IV. we find them rebuilding it. The gate was adorned with the effigies of <num value="2">two</num>   bishops, probably Bishop Erkenwald and Bishop William, and with effigies supposed to have represented King Alfred and Alred, Earl of Mercia, to whom Alfred entrusted the   care of the gate.   It was rebuilt several times. 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.152.2">The latest form</LEMMA> of it is shown on page <num value="154">154</num>.

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.153.1">The old house where Sir Paul Pindar</LEMMA>, a   great City merchant of the reign of James I., lived still exists in Bishopsgate Street, with some traces of its ancient splendour.   This Sir Paul was ambassador for James I. to the   Grand Legion, and helped to extend English commerce in Turkey. He brought back with him a diamond valued at <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure>, which James wished to buy on credit, but prudent Sir Paul declined this unsatisfactory mode of purchase, and used to lend it to the monarch on gala days.

 precious stone. Sir Paul was appointed farmer of the Customs to James I., and frequently supplied the cravings for money both of James and Charles. In the year <datestruct value="1639"><year reg="1639">1639</year></datestruct> Sir Paul was esteemed worth <measure value="236000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="236000">236,000</num></measure>, exclusive of bad debts.   He expended <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> in the repairing of St. Paul's Cathedral, yet, nevertheless, died in debt, owing to his generosity to King Charles. The king owed him and the other Commissioners of the Customs <measure value="300000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300000">300,000</num></measure>, for the security of which, in <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>, they offered the Parliament <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure>, but the proposition was not entertained.   On his death affairs were   left in such a perplexed state, that his executor, William Toomer, unable to bear the work and the disappointment, destroyed himself. Mr. J. T. Smith, in his <title>Topography of London,</title> has a drawing of a room on the <num value="1">first</num> floor of this house. The ceiling was covered with panelled oramentations, and the chimney-piece, of carved oak and stone, was adorned with a badly-executed <foreign lang=it>basso-relievo</foreign> of Hercules and Atlas supporting an egg-shaped globe. Below this were tablets of stag hunts. The sides of the chimney-piece were formed by grotesque figures, the whole being a very splendid specimen of Elizabethan decorative art. In <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>   the whole of the ornaments, says Mr. Smith, were barbarously cut. away to render the room, as the possessors said, <QUOTE>a little comfortable.</QUOTE> The Pindar arms, <QUOTE>a chevron argent, between <num value="3">three</num> lyon's heads, erased ermine crowned or,</QUOTE> were found hidden by a piece of tin in the centre of the ceiling.

<P> <QUOTE>The front towards the street,</QUOTE> says Mr. Hugo, <QUOTE>with its gable bay windows, and matchless panelwork, together with a subsequent addition of brick on its northern side, is <num value="1">one</num> of the best specimens of the period now extant. The edifice was commenced in <num value="1">one</num> of the closing   years of the reign of Elizabeth, on the return from his residence in Italy of its great and good master. It was originally very spacious, and extended for a considerable distance, both to the south side and to the rear of the present dwelling. The adjoining tenements in Half-moon Street, situated immediately at the back of the building, which faces Bishopsgate Street, though manifesting no external signs of interest, are rich beyond expression in internal ornament.   The   primary arrangement, indeed, of the mansion is entirely destroyed. Very little of the original internal woodwork remains, and that of the plainest character. But, in several of the rooms on the <num value="1">first</num> floors of the houses just referred to, there still exist some of the most glorious ceilings which our country can furnish. They are generally mutilated, in several instances the half alone remaining, as the rooms have been divided into <num value="2">two</num> or more portions, to suit the needs of later generations.   These ceilings are of plaster, and abound in the richest and finest devices. Wreaths of flowers, panels, shields, pateras, bands, roses, ribands, and other forms of ornamentation, are charmingly mingled, and unite in producing the best and happiest effect. <num value="1">One</num> of them, which is all but perfect, consists of a large device in the centre, representing the sacrifice of Isaac, from which a most exquisite design radiates to the very extremities of the room. In general, however, the work consists of various figures placed within multangular compartments of different sizes, that in the centre of the room   usually the largest.   The projecting ribs, which in their turn enclose the compartments, are themselves furnished with plentiful ornamentation, consisting of bands of oak-leaves and other vegetable forms; and, in several instances, have fine pendants at the points of intersection. The cornices consist of a rich series of highly-ornamented mouldings.   Every part, however, is in strict keeping, and none of the details surfeit the taste or weary the eye.</QUOTE> 
<P>At a little distance, in Half-moon Alley, stood an old structure, now pulled down, ornamented with figures, which is traditionally reported to have been the keeper's lodge in the park attached to Sir Paul's residence; and mulberry-trees, and other park-like vestiges in this neighbourhood, are still within memory.

A canopied altar of stone, affixed to the wall, indicates the position of <num value="1">one</num> set of these <QUOTE>nuns' gratings.</QUOTE> The priory of St. Helen's was much augmented in <datestruct value="1308--"><year reg="1308">1308</year></datestruct> by William Basing, a London sheriff, and when it was surrendered to Henry VIII. its annual revenue was <measure value="376l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="376">376</num></measure> <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>s.</measure> During the Middle Ages the church was divided from east to west by a partition, to separate the nuns from the parishioners; but after the dissolution this was removed.   Sir Thomas Gresham, according to Stow, promised this church a steeple in consideration of the ground taken up by his monument. 
<P>However, architects praise this church as picturesque,   with   its <num value="2">two</num> heavy equal aisles, and its pointed arches.  There is a transept at the east end, and beyond it a small chapel, dedicated   to the Holy Ghost.  Against the north wall is a range of seats formerly occupied by the nuns. The church is a composite of various periods. St. Helen's, says Mr. Godwin, contains perhaps   more   monuments (especially altartombs) than any other parish   church in the metropolis, and   these give an especial air of antiquity and solemnity to the building. Here is the ugly tomb containing the embalmed body of Francis Bancroft. He caused the tomb to be built for himself in <datestruct value="1726--"><year reg="1726">1726</year></datestruct>. He is said to have made a fortune of nearly <measure value="28000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="28000">28,000</num></measure> by greedy exactions, the whole of which he left to the almshouses and the Drapers' Company. In a small southern transept is a most singular table monument in memory of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.154.1">Sir. Julius Caesar</LEMMA>, Privy Counsellor to James I., Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Master of the Rolls, who died about <datestruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></datestruct>. The epitaph, written by himself, engraved on a large deed, sealed and folded (the string to the seal represented as breaking), purports to be an engagement on the part of the deceased to pay the debt of Nature whenever God shall please and require it. The tomb, the work of Nicholas Stone, cost <measure value="110l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="110">110</num></measure>.

 altar-tomb, are recumbent figures of a knight in armour, and a lady. The knight is Sir John Crosby, who died in the year <datestruct value="1475"><year reg="1475">1475</year></datestruct>, the builder of 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.154.3">Crosby Hall</LEMMA> who contributed largely to the church. Behind this is a large columned and canopied monument in memory of Sir William Pickering, famous for worth in learning, arts, and warfare. His effigy in armour reclines on a piece of sculptured matting, folded at <num value="1">one</num> end to represent a pillow. Strype says he died in <datestruct value="1542--"><year reg="1542">1542</year></datestruct>.   But the greatest of all the monuments at St. Helen's is that of Sir Thomas Gresham, a large sculptured altar-tomb covered with a marble slab.   Another curious monument near Gresham's is that of Matthew Bond, captain of the London Trained Bands in the time of the Armada.   He is represented sitting within a tent, with <num value="2">two</num> sentries standing outside, and an attendant bringing up a horse. There were also buried here Sir John Lawrence, the good Lord Mayor who behaved so nobly in the Plague year, and Sir John Spencer, the rich Lord Mayor of of Elizabeth's reign, whose daughter ran away with Lord Compton, escaping from her father's house in a baker's basket. 
<P>The charity-box in the church vestibule is supported by a curious carved figure of a mendicant. Mr. Godwin, writing in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>, laments the ill-proportioned turret of St. Helen's, and the carvings of the mongrel Italian style. 
<P>The recent restorations and improvements have greatly increased the attractions of St. Helen's, while the magnificent stained-glass windows, that have been added to the sacred edifice, are modern works eminently worthy of the objects of ancient art, and the fine sculptures to be found within the walls. Of these windows <num value="1">one</num> is in the memory of Sir Thomas Gresham, and has been contributed by the Gresham Committee, while <num value="2">two</num> others have been erected at the expense of the family of Mr. McDougall. The magnificent window, in memory of the late Alderman Sir William Copeland, is a most striking work, but is not inferior in interest to the restoration, which was made at the expense of <pb id="P.155" n="155">

Several other fine memorial windows have been added to the building, amongst which are those contributed by the vicar, the Rev. J. E. Cox, and by Mr. W. Williams, of Great St. Helen's, who has taken a deep interest in the work of restoration. Some other splendid examples of stained glass were contributed by Mr. Alderman Wilson and Mr. Deputy Jones; and the fine communion window was presented by Mr. Kirkman Hodgson, M.P., and his brother, Mr. James Stewart Hodgson. The tomb of Sir John Crosby has been renovated, as well as that of Sir John Spencer, which has been restored and removed under the direction of the Marquis of Northampton and Mr. Wodmore, who has himself contributed   a window in memory of Bishop Robinson, and has superintended the entire restoration. 
<P> <QUOTE>Not a stone now remains,</QUOTE> says Mr. Hugo, <QUOTE>to tell of the old priory of St. Helen's and its glories.

Sir John died in <datestruct value="1475--"><year reg="1475">1475</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">four</num> or so years only after the completion of the building. He was buried in the church of St. Helen's, where we have already described his tomb. The effigy is fully armed, and the armour is worn over the alderman's mantle, while round the neck there is a collar of suns and roses, the badge of the House of York, to which that knight had adhered so faithfully. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1470--"><year reg="1470">1470</year></datestruct> Crosby   Hall became a palace, for the widow of Sir John parted with the new City mansion to that dark and wily intriguer,   Richard, Duke of Gloucester. <QUOTE>There,</QUOTE> says Sir Thomas More, <QUOTE>he lodged himself and little by little all folks drew unto him, so   that the Protector's court was crowded and King Henry's left desolate.</QUOTE>

The weekly bequest of Cycillia Cyoll, wife of this same Cyoll, is still distributed at St. Helen's Church.

The inscription <pb id="P.157" n="157"> on Bond's tomb in St. Helen's Church describes him as a merchant adventurer, and most famous in his age for his great adventures by both sea and land. Bond entertained the Spanish ambassador at Crosby Hall, as his sons afterwards did the Danish ambassador.

In <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct> this lady made strenuous efforts for its conservation, and received valuable assistance from   Mr. W.

The main entrance, Mr. Hugo thinks, was no doubt under the minstrel's gallery, at the south end.   In the centre of the oriel ceiling is still to be seen, in high relief, the crest of Sir John Crosby--a ram trippant, argent, armed and hoofed, or.

<P>The Ward of Bishopsgate having partially escaped the Great Fire, is still especially rich in old houses. In most cases the gable ends have been removed, and, in many, walls have been built in front of the ground floors up to the projecting storeys; but frequently the backs of the houses present their original structure. Mr. Hugo, writing in the year <datestruct value="1857"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>, has described nearly all places of interest; but many of these have since been modified or pulled down. The houses Nos. <num value="81">81</num> to <num value="85">85</num> inclusive, in Bishopsgate Street Without, were Elizabethan. On the front of <num value="1">one</num> of these the date, <datestruct value="1590"><year reg="1590">1590</year></datestruct>, was formerly visible. In Artillery Lane the same antiquary found houses which, at the back, preserved their Elizabethan character. In No. <num value="19">19</num>, Widegate Street, there was a fine ceiling of the time of Charles I. The houses adjoining Sir Paul Pindar's, numbered <num value="170">170</num> and <num value="171">171</num>, possessed ceilings of a noble character, and had probably formed part of Sir Paul Pindar's. The lodge in Half-moon Street, now destroyed, had a most noble chimneypiece, probably executed by Inigo Jones, besides wainscoted walls and rich ceilings. No. <num value="26">26</num>, Bishopsgate Street Without possessed <num value="2">two</num> splendid back rooms, with decorations in the style of Louis XIV., full of flowing lines. In Still Alley, in <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>, there were several Elizabethan houses, since modernised. White Hart Court (though the old inn was gone before) boasted a row of <num value="4">four</num> houses, of beautiful design, in the Inigo Jones manner. 
<P>In the house No. <num value="18">18</num>, at the corner of Devonshire Street, Mr. Hugo discovered, as he imagined, a portion of the Earl of Devonshire's house, or that of Lord John Powlet. It was of the Elizabethan age, and <num value="1">one</num> room   contained a rich cornice of masks, fruit, and leaves, connected by ribands. In another there were, over the fireplace, the arms of Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, and Shakespeare's friend. At the corner of Houndsditch, No. <num value="8">8</num>, Bishopsgate Street Without, there was an Elizabethan house, and at the opposite corner, No. <num value="7">7</num>, was a house with fine staircases, and walls and ceilings profusely decorated <hi rend=italics>a la</hi> Louis Quatorze. Just beyond, a tablet, surmounted with the figure of a mitre inserted in the wall, a little north of Camomile Street, marks the site of the old. Bishops' Gate. 
<P>At <num value="66">66</num>, Bishopsgate Street Within, there was a finely-groined undercroft, of the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century. At the end of Pea Hen Court, Mr. Hugo, in his antiquarian tour of <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>, records a doorway of James I. In Great St. Helen's Place, the same antiquary found, at No. <num value="2">2</num>, a good doorway and staircase of Charles I.; and at Nos. <num value="3">3</num> and <num value="4">4</num>, some Elizabethan relics. Nos. <num value="8">8</num> and <num value="9">9</num> he pronounced to be modern subdivisions of a superb house. On the front was the date, <datestruct value="1646"><year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct>. It was of brick, ornamented with pilasters, and contained a matchless staircase and a fine chimney-piece.   Nos.   <num value="11">11</num>   and <num value="12">12</num>, Great St. Helen's, Mr. Hugo noted as a red brick house, with pilasters of the same material The simple but artistic doorways he had little <pb id="P.159" n="159">

 hesitation in attributing to Inigo Jones: he supposed them to have been erected about <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>, the year Inigo designed the south entrance of St. Helen's Church. 
<P>At No. <num value="3">3</num>, Crosby Square, Mr. Hugo found a fine doorway (<abbr lang=la>temp.</abbr> Charles II.), in the style of Wren. This square was built in <datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>, on the site of part of Crosby Hall. At Crosby Hall Chambers, No. <num value="25">25</num>, Bishopsgate Street Within, the street front had lost all ancient peculiarities, except <num value="2">two</num> beautiful festoons of flowers inserted between the windows of the <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="2">second</num> floors.

<P><num value="1">One</num> of the glories of old Bishopsgate was the mansion built there by Sir Thomas Gresham, in <datestruct value="1563--"><year reg="1563">1563</year></datestruct>. It consisted (says Mr. Burgon, his best biographer) of a square court, surrounded by a covered piazza, and had spacious offices adjoining. It was girdled by pleasant gardens, and extended from Bishopsgate Street, on the <num value="1">one</num> side, to Broad Street on the other.   The   <num value="1">first</num> plan of the college which afterwards occupied this house was to have <num value="7">seven</num> professors, who should lecture once a week in succession on divinity, astronomy, music, geometry, law, medicine, and rhetoric.

<P> <QUOTE>The Jew old-clothesmen,</QUOTE> says Mr. Mayhew, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>are generally far more cleanly in their habits than the poorer classes of English people. Their hands they always wash before their meals, and this is done whether the party be a strict Jew or  <Q> Meshumet,</Q>  a convert or apostate from Judaism. Neither will the Israelite ever use the same knife to cut his meat that he previously used to spread his butter, and he will not even put his meat upon a plate that has had butter on it; nor will he use for his soup the spoon that has had melted butter in it. This objection to mix butter with meat is carried so far, that, after partaking of the <num value="1">one</num>, Jews will not eat of the other for <num value="2">two</num> hours.   The Jews are, generally, when married, most exemplary family men.   There are few fonder fathers than they are, and they will starve themselves sooner than their wives or children should want.   Whatever their faults may be, they are good fathers, husbands, and sons. Their principal characteristic is their extreme love of money; and, though the strict Jew does not trade himself on the Sabbath, he may not object to employ either <num value="1">one</num> of his tribe, or a Gentile to do so for him. 
<P>The capital required for commencing in the old clothes line is generally about ;I. This the Jew frequently borrows, especially after holiday time, for then he has generally spent all his earnings, unless he be a provident man. When his stockmoney is exhausted, he goes either to a neighbour or to a publican in the vicinity, and borrows <measure value="1l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1">1</num></measure> on the Monday morning,  <Q>to strike a light with,</Q>  as he calls it, and agrees to return it on the Friday evening, with a shilling interest for the loan. This he always pays back. If he were to sell the coat off his back he would do this, I am told, because to fail in so doing would be to prevent his obtaining any stock-money in the future. With this capital he starts on his rounds about <num value="8">eight</num> in the morning, and I am assured he will frequently begin his work without tasting food rather than break into the borrowed stock-money. Each man has his particular walk, and never interferes with that of his neighbour; indeed, while upon another's beat, he will seldom cry for clothes. Sometimes they gohalf  <Q>rybeck</Q>  together--that is, they will share the profits of the day's business; and when they agree to do this, the <num value="1">one</num> will take <num value="1">one</num> street, and the other another. The lower the neighbourhood the more old clothes are there for sale. At the East-end of the town they like the neighbourhoods frequented by sailors; and there they purchase of the girls and the women the sailors' jackets and trousers.   But they buy most of the Petticoat Lane, the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.164.1">Old Clothes Exchange</LEMMA>,. and the marinestore dealers; for, as the Jew clothes-man never travels thee streets by night-time, the parties who then have old clothes' to dispose of usually sell them to the marine-store or <num value="2">second</num>-hand dealers over-night, and the Jew buys them in the morning. The <num value="1">first</num> that he does on his rounds is to seek out these shops, and see what he can pick up there.

It was, as I remember, about <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> years after the Plague was ceased, that Sir Robert Clayton came to be possessed of the ground.   It was reported, how true I know not, that it fell to the king for want of heirs, all those <pb id="P.165" n="165"> who had any right to it being carried off by the pestilence, and that Sir Robert Clayton obtained a grant of it from Charles II. But however he came by it, certain it is the ground was let out to be built upon, or built upon by his order. The <num value="1">first</num> house built upon it was a large fair house, still standing, which faces the street or way now called Hand Alley, which, though called an alley, is as wide as a street.   The houses, in the same row with that house northward, are built on the very same ground where the poor people were buried, and the bodies, on opening the ground for the foundations, were dug up; some of them remaining so plain to be seen, that the women's skulls were distinguished by their long hair, and of others the flesh was not quite perished, so that the people began to exclaim   loudly against it, and some suggested that it might endanger a return of the contagion. After which the bones and bodies, as they came at them, were carried to another part of the same ground, and thrown all together into a deep pit dug on purpose, which now is to be known in that it is not built on, but is a passage to another house at the upper end of Rose Alley, just against the door of a meeting-house. <gap>   There lie the bones and   remains of near <num value="2000">2,000</num> bodies, carried by the dead-carts to their graves in that <num value="1">one</num> year.</QUOTE> 
<P>A   turning from   Houndsditch, of unsavoury memory, leads to Bevis Marks. Here formerly stood the City mansion and gardens of the abbots of Bury. The corruption of Bury's Marks to Bevis Marks is undoubted, though not obvious. Stow describes it as <QUOTE><num value="1">one</num> great house, large of rooms, fair courts, and garden plots'</QUOTE> some time pertaining to the Bassets, and afterwards to the abbots of Bury. Bury Street, where the old house stood, was remarkable for a synagogue of Portuguese Jews, and a Dissenting chapel, where the good Dr. Watts was for many years pastor. 
<P>Towards Camomile Street, close to London Wall, stood the Papey, a religious house belonging to a brotherhood of St. John and St. Charity (our readers will remember Shakespeare talks of <QUOTE>By Gis and by St. Charity</QUOTE> ), founded in <datestruct value="1430--"><year reg="1430">1430</year></datestruct>, by <num value="3">three</num> charity priests.   The members were professional mourners, and are often so represented on monuments. The original band consisted of a master, <num value="2">two</num> wardens, chaplains, chantry priests, conducts, and other brothers and sisters. Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's astute and wily secretary, afterwards inhabited the house. 
<P>Old   Broad Street, as late as the reign of Charles I., was (says Cunningham) <num value="1">one</num> of the most fashionable streets in London.   In Elizabeth's reign, Gilbert Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, lived here, and, in Charles's time, Lords Weston and Dover. Here at the same time was a glass-house, where Venice glasses (then so prized) were made by Venetian workmen. Mr. James Howell, author of the <title>Familiar Letters</title> which bear his name, was (says Strype) steward to this house. When Howell, unable to bear the heat of the place, gave up his stewardship, he said, if he had stayed much longer, he should in a short time have melted to nothing among these hot Venetians. The place afterwards became Pinners' Hall, and then a Dissenting chapel. The Pinners, or Pinmakers, were incorporated by Charles I.

<P>In Old Broad Street the elder Dance built the 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.166.1">Excise Office in <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct></LEMMA> which was removed in <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct> to Somerset House. This Government Office originally stood on the west side of Ironmonger Lane, where was formerly the mansion of Sir J. Frederick. For <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> a year the trustees of the Gresham estates annihilated Gresham College.   Dance's building, of stone and brick, was much praised for its simple grandeur. Charles J. seems to have intended to levy excise duties as early as <datestruct value="1626"><year reg="1626">1626</year></datestruct>, but the Parliament stopped him. The Parliament, however, to maintain their forces, were compelled to found an Excise Office, in <datestruct value="1643--"><year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct>, and ale, beer, cider, and perry were the <num value="1">first</num> articles taxed, together with wine, silks, fur, hats, and lace. There were riots in London about the new system, and the mob burnt down the Excise House in Smithfield. The Excise revenue at <num value="1">first</num> amounted to <measure value="1334532l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1334532">1,334,532</num></measure>. The <num value="1">first</num> act after the Restoration was to abolish excise on all articles except ale, &amp;c., which produced an annual revenue of <measure value="666383l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="666383">666,383</num></measure>. The duties on glass and malt were <num value="1">first</num> imposed in William's reign, and the salt duty was then re-imposed.   Queen Anne's expensive wars led to duties on paper and soap; and her revenue from excise amounted to.<measure value="1738000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1738000">1,738,000</num></measure> a year. In the reign of George I. the produce of the Excise averaged <measure value="2340000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2340000">2,340,000</num></measure>. Sir Robert Walpole did all he could to extend the Excise, while Pitt carried out all Walpole had attempted. In <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, no fewer than <num value="29">twenty-nine</num> articles were subject to the Excise laws, and the gross revenue from them amounted to <num value="10">ten</num> millions and a half. In <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>, the number of officers employed in England was <num value="4777">4,777</num>. In <pb id="P.166" n="166"> the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="20">twenty</num> years after the peace, the reduction of duties led to the dismissal of <num value="847">847</num> Excise officers. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> of the most distinguished inhabitants of Broad Street, many years ago, was the great surgeon, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.166.2">Sir Astley Cooper</LEMMA>. <QUOTE>He was then,</QUOTE> says <QUOTE>Aleph,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>attached to Guy's Hospital, having a large class of pupils, and a numerous morning levee of City patients.   His house was a capacious corner tenement in Broad Street, on the righthand side of the wide-paved court leading by St. Botolph's Church into Bishopsgate Street. When patients applied they were ushered into a large front room, which would comfortably receive from <num value="40">forty</num> to <num value="50">fifty</num> persons.

But the time was coming when patients were to stand for hours in his ante-rooms waiting for an interview, and were often dismissed without being admitted to the consulting-room.

It is a geometrical pattern of broad blue lines, forming intersections of octagon and lozenge compartments.   The octagon figures are bordered with a cable pattern, shaded with grey, and interlaced with a square border, shaded with red and yellow. In the centres, within a ring, are expanded flowers, shaded in red, yellow, and grey; the double row of leaves radiating from a figure called a truelove-knot, alternately with a figure something like the tiger-lily. Between the octagon figures are square compartments bearing various devices; in the centre of the pavement is Ariadne, or a Bacchante, reclining on the back of a panther; but only the fore-paws, <num value="1">one</num> of the hind-paws, and the tail remain. Over the head of the figure floats a light drapery forming an arch. Another square contains a <num value="2">two</num>-handled vase. In the demi-octagons, at the sides of the pattern, are lunettes; <num value="1">one</num> contains a fan ornament, another a bowl crowned with flowers. The lozenge intersections are variously embellished with leaves, shells, truelove-knots, chequers, and an ornament shaped like a dice-box. At the corners of the pattern   are   truelove-knots.      Surrounding   this pattern, in a broad cable-like border, are broad bands of blue and white alternately.

<P>What we have already written of the discovery of Roman antiquities on the site of the Royal Exchange will serve to show how completely <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.170.4">Cornhill</LEMMA>
 traverses the centre of Roman London. 
<P>A corn-market, says Stow,  was <QUOTE>time   out of mind,   there holden.</QUOTE> Drapers were the earliest inhabitants. Lydgate   speaks of it as a place where old clothes were bought, and sometimes stolen--

<P>The <num value="2">two</num> great ornaments of mediaeval Cornhill were   the   Tun, a round house, or temporary prison, and the Standard, a water conduit, and point of measurement. 
<P>The Tun, says Stow, was built in the year <datestruct value="1282"><year reg="1282">1282</year></datestruct>, by Henry Wallis, Mayor of London, as a prison for night offenders. For breaking open the prison and releasing prisoners,   certain citizens, in the reign of Edward I., were fined <measure value="20000bmark" type=currency><num value="20000">20,000</num> marks</measure>. Abandoned priests were sometimes   locked up here. In <datestruct value="1401--"><year reg="1401">1401</year></datestruct>, the Tun was turned into a conduit, and   a cage, stocks, and pillory added, for scolds and cheating bakers.       Rascals of various kinds were, in Edward IV.&lsquo;s reign, compelled to ride from Newgate to this pillory, in Cornhill, and there stand, with papers detailing their offences tied to their heads. 
<P>The Standard was a conduit, with <num value="4">four</num> spouts, made by Peter Morris, a German, in the year <datestruct value="1582"><year reg="1582">1582</year></datestruct>, and supplied with Thames water, conveyed by leaden pipes over the steeple of St. Magnus' Church. It stood at the east end of Cornhill, at its junction with Gracechurch Street, Bishopsgate Street, and Leadenhall Street.   The water ceased to run between <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></datestruct>, but the Standard itself remained long after.   It was much used as a point of measurement of distances; and Cunningham says that several of our suburban milestones are still inscribed with <QUOTE>so many miles from the Standard in Cornhill.</QUOTE> There was a Standard in Cornhill as early as the <num value="2">2nd</num> of Henry V. 
<P>Cornhill, considering its commercial importance, is a street by no means full of old memories. 
<P>St. Michael's, Cornhill, is <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="7">seven</num> London churches dedicated to the   Archangel Michael, the patron saint of France.   It formerly faced Cornhill, but in the reign of Edward IV. it was blocked out by <num value="4">four</num> houses, and it may now be described as standing on the east side of St. Michael's Alley. It is probable that a Saxon church <num value="1">first</num> stood   here; but the earliest record of the fabric is previous to <datestruct value="1133--"><year reg="1133">1133</year></datestruct>.   In that year the Abbot of Evesham granted it to Sparling, a priest, for the rent of <measure value="1bmark" type=currency><num value="1">one</num> mark</measure> a year, and lodging, salt, water, and firing to the abbot, whenever he came to London. <pb id="P.171" n="171">

<P>William Rous, sheriff of London in <datestruct value="1429--"><year reg="1429">1429</year></datestruct>, and who was buried in the chapel of St. Mary in this church, left <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> to found an altar in the chancel, and <measure value="40l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40">40</num></measure> towards a new tower, the old <num value="1">one</num> having been burnt down in <datestruct value="1421--"><year reg="1421">1421</year></datestruct>. At the south side of the church there was originally a cloister, and in the churchyard a pulpit-cross, built by Sir John Rudston, Lord Mayor of London, who was buried beneath it. In the church is interred <num value="1">one</num> of our old chroniclers, Alderman Fabian, who died in <datestruct value="1511--"><year reg="1511">1511</year></datestruct>. He is well known for his <title>Chronicles of England and France,</title> which he termed <QUOTE>The Concordance of Histories.</QUOTE> Here also rest the remains of the ancestors of another useful London chronicler, who was born in this parish, where his predecessors had resided for <num value="3">three</num> generations. Stow's father and grandfather were both buried here.   The grandfather, a tallow-chandler, with due remembrance of candles sold by him for such purposes, directs in his will that from All Hallows' Day till the Candlemas following a watching-candle burn on all the <num value="7">seven</num> altars of the church from <num value="6">six</num> o'clock till past <num value="7">seven</num>, in worship of the <num value="7">seven</num> sacraments. He also gave to a poor man and woman, every Sunday in <num value="1">one</num> year, <num value="1">one</num> penny to say <num value="5">five</num> paternosters and aves and a creed for his soul. 
<P>The old church, all but the tower, was destroyed by the Great Fire, and Wren commenced <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.171.2">the present building</LEMMA> in <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>. The tower itself had to be rebuilt in <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>. The body of the church is in the Italian style, divided by Doric columns and arches. The tower is perpendicular, in imitation of the chapel tower at Magdalen College, Oxford, and it rises to the height of <num value="130">130</num> feet.   Wren spoiled his rival tower by a mixture of Italian details. This church was magnificently decorated in <datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>, from designs by <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.171.3">Mr. G. G. Scott</LEMMA>. 
<P>The chronicler Stow has the following legend, relating how the devil came down to St. Michael's belfry in a storm of lightning :-- <QUOTE>Upon St. James's Night,</QUOTE> says our venerable author, <QUOTE>certain men in the loft next under the bells, ringing of a peal, a tempest of lightning and thunder did arise: an ugly-shapen sight appeared to them coming in at the south window and lighted on the north. For fear whereof they all fell down, and lay as dead for the time, letting the bells ring and cease of their own accord. When the ringers came to themselves, they found certain stones of the north window to be raised and scratched, as if they had been so much butter printed with a lyon's claw; the same stones were fastened there again, and so remain till this day. I have seen them oft, and have put a feather or small stick into the holes where the claws had entered <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> inches deep.</QUOTE> 
<P>A brass slab preserved at <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.171.4">St. Peter's, Cornhill</LEMMA>, claims that building as the <num value="1">first</num> Christian church founded in London. The legendary founder was Lucius, the <num value="1">first</num> Christian king, A.D. <datestruct value="179"><year reg="179">179</year></datestruct>. It is said to have remained the metropolitan church of the kingdom till the coming of St. Augustine, <num value="400">four hundred</num> years after. 
<P>In the reign of Henry III. <num value="1">one</num> Geffrey Russell, who had been implicated in a murder said to have been committed by another man in St. Peter's Churchyard, fled for sanctuary to St. Peter's Church. In the year <datestruct value="1243"><year reg="1243">1243</year></datestruct>, <num value="1">one</num> of the priests attached to St. Peter's, Cornhill, was murdered. The patronage of the rectory came into the hands of Sir Richard Whittington, and others, who conveyed it, in <datestruct value="1411--"><year reg="1411">1411</year></datestruct>, to the Lord Mayor and Commonalty of London. Among the celebrated rectors we must not forget Dr. William Beveridge, afterwards Bishop of St. Asaph. Dr. Beveridge (died <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>) was an eminent theological writer, famous for his Syriac Grammar, and his laborious work on the Apostolical Canons. The old church was destroyed by the Great Fire, and the present edifice erected in <datestruct value="1686--"><year reg="1686">1686</year></datestruct> by Sir Christopher Wren. The tower of brick is surmounted by a small leaden cupola and spire, crowned by an enormous key. The church contains a tablet recording the death, in a great fire, <datestruct VALUE="1782-01-18"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=18>18th</day>, <year reg=1782>1782</year></datestruct>, of the <num value="7">seven</num> children of James Woodmason, of Leadenhall Street. Leading from the church, it is said, is a subterranean passage, entered by a flight of steps from the belfry. Some <QUOTE>London tavern</QUOTE> apprentices are reported. many years ago, to have explored this passage, which is now bricked up. Many years ago a stone coffin and urn were found within the enclosure of the church. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> of the most celebrated taverns in Cornhill was the <QUOTE>Pope's Head,</QUOTE> mentioned as early as the reign of Edward IV. Here, in the reign of Henry VI., wine was sold at a penny a pint, without charge for bread. Stow seems to think the <QUOTE>Pope's Head</QUOTE> had once been a royal palace. In his time the ancient arms of England (<num value="3">three</num> leopards supported by <num value="2">two</num> angels) were to be seen engraved in stone on the walls. It was here that the Alicant and English goldsmiths decided their wager, as we have already mentioned in our chapter on the Goldsmiths' Company.   In <datestruct value="1615--"><year reg="1615">1615</year></datestruct>, Sir William Craven (father of the <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Craven) left the <QUOTE>Pope's Head</QUOTE> to the Merchant Taylors' Company, for charitable purposes, and the Company had in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct> <num value="9">nine</num> houses on that spot.

In <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct> the occupant was also a perfumer. The <num value="2">second</num> great fire, in <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, also commenced at a peruke-maker's, in Bishopsgate Street, near Leadenhall Street. It made a clean sweep of all the houses from Cornhill to St.. Martin Outwich; and the church parsonage, Merchant Taylors' Hall, and several houses in Threadneedle Street, were much damaged.

<P>At a corner house, says Mr. Timbs, between Cornhill and Lombard Street, Thomas Guy, the wealthy stationer, commenced business. He was the son of a lighterman at Horsleydown, and was apprenticed to a Cheapside bookseller, as before mentioned by us. The <QUOTE>Lucky Corner</QUOTE> was subsequently Pidding's Lottery Office.

 <QUOTE>Throw but a stone, the giant dies.</QUOTE> A   happy image, in singularly small compass. 
<P>Fenchurch Street another thoroughfare scanty in memories, and therefore still open for future fame, took its name from   the marshy ground on the banks of the Langbourne. Indeed, even in Stow's time, the ward was called Langbourne or Fennieabout; yet at that date some crotchety antiquaries insisted that it was called Fenchurch from <hi rend=italics>faenum,</hi>
 or hay sold there, as Gracechurch from its grass and herbs. 
<P>In this street, which runs from Gracechurch to Aldgate, formerly stood Denmark House, the residence, in the reign of Philip and Mary (<datestruct value="1557--"><year reg="1557">1557</year></datestruct>), of the <num value="1">first</num> Russian ambassador sent to England. <pb id="P.176" n="176"> The Russian Company had just started, and our merchants, eager for barbaric furs, gold, and amber, treated the Muscovite duke's envoy with prudent respect.   They met him, with their velvet gowns and gold chains, at Tottenham.   At Islington Lord Montacute, the Queen's pensioner, welcomed his approach, and at the same place the Lord Mayor and aldermen, in a blaze of scarlet, came up, and accompanied him to Master Dimmocks' in Fenchurch Street. 
<P>Of all London saints   perhaps      <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.176.1">St. Dionis</LEMMA>       or Dionysius, the Areopagite, is the least honoured; and yet St. Dionis was the St. Denis of France. St. Dionis is called Backchurch, as   some think, from there having originally been a church   to St. Gabriel in the centre the roadway, behind which stood St. Dionis;   but this is doubtful.   This church, mentioned as early as <datestruct value="1288"><year reg="1288">1288</year></datestruct>, was rebuilt in the reign of Henry VI., and again   after the Great Fire under Wren's supervision. The   Ionic columns, carved pulpit, and motley altar-piece need no description. Near the communion-table is an ugly granite monument to Sir Arthur Ingram, a Spanish merchant, who gave his name to Ingram   Court in this street, and was a great benefactor to the church. In the vestry they preserve as interesting relics <num value="4">four</num> large syringes (such as they now use in Constantinople),   the only machines formerly known for extinguishing fires. They are rather more than <num value="2">two</num> feet long, and were fastened by straps to the body of the firemen.   The tower is <num value="40">forty</num> feet high. 
<P>At the King's Head Tavern, No. <num value="53">53</num>,   Fenchurch Street, the Princess Elizabeth, when   released from the Tower by her harsh sister Mary, is said to have dined, after attending divine service at the church of Allhallows Staining, in Mark Lane. The   young lady, always a fair trencherwoman, exulting in freedom and fresh air, partook freely of pork and peas.   This royal act of condescension was celebrated till quite recently by an annual dinner of the chief parishioners. In the coffeeroom they still show, with honest pride, the metal dish and cover said to have been occupied by the afore-mentioned peas and pork,   and an engraved portrait of the young princess by Holbein. Another legend has it that the princess, on quitting Allhallows, gave the clerk a handsome fee, which he celebrated by an annual dinner given to his chief patrons. 
<P>The Church of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.176.2">St. Margaret Pattens</LEMMA> was so called (says Stow) because pattens were usually made and sold in this neighbourhood, but more probably, we think, from the church being specially decorated (altar or roof) with such <QUOTE>patines of bright gold</QUOTE> as those to which Shakespeare, in the <title>Merchant of Venice</title>, compares the stars. The venerable shade of   Stow will forgive us this trifling rebellion to his dictum.   This church is mentioned as early as <datestruct value="1344"><year reg="1344">1344</year></datestruct>, was in Whittington's gift, and was rebuilt after the Great Fire.   In <datestruct value="1538--"><year reg="1538">1538</year></datestruct>, the rood, having been left in the churchyard to receive oblations, was destroyed   by some too zealous Reformer. The altar-piece, is by Carlo Maratti. The great antiquary, Dr. Birch, rector of the parish nearly <num value="19">nineteen</num> years, is buried here.   Above the altar are some finely-carved flowers. 
<P>In Fenchurch Street, on the site of Northumberland Alley, stood the <num value="1">first</num> town residence of the Earls of Northumberland. The gardens were afterwards converted into bowling-alleys for all comers. 
<P>St. Catherine Coleman, close to where Northumberland House once stood, derived its name from a large garden belonging to <num value="1">one</num> Coleman (date uncertain). This church escaped the Great Fire, and was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>.

<P><datestruct value="06-11"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=11>11</day></datestruct>.

<P>Out of respect to Fenchurch Street, we may mention its small tributary, Billiter Street, a name corrupted from Belzettar, a forgotten builder or owner.   Strype describes the place as consisting of poor and ordinary houses formerly inhabited by needy, beggarly people. The inhabitants were then brokers and chandlers, residing in very old and ruinous timber houses.   The chief ornament of it was Billiter Square, which Strype describes as <QUOTE>a very handsome, open, and airy place, graced with good new-brick buildings very well inhabited.</QUOTE> 
<P>Ironmongers' Hall in Fenchurch Street is a building with a history and traditions of its own.   The iron that supplied London in the Middle Ages was chiefly worked in Sussex, Surrey, and Kent. 
<P>The earliest account, says Mr. Herbert, we have of the Ironmongers as a guild is in the <num value="37">37th</num> year of Edward III., when on occasion of the various mysteries making their offerings to the king for carrying on his French wars, the Ironmongers sub- <pb id="P.177" n="177">

Near this period, and for a long time afterwards, the Ironmongers' appear to have united the professions both of merchant and trader, for, whilst they had large warehouses and yards, whence they exported and sold bar-iron and iron rods, they had also shops, wherein they displayed abundance of manufactured articles, which they purchased from   the workmen in town and country, and of which they afterwards became the general retailers. Ironmonger Lane was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> spots on which the trade congregated. Many of the rich Ironmongers were buried in the church of the adjacent united parishes of St Olave Jewry and St. Martin, Ironmonger Lane. 
<P>The Ironmongers were incorporated in the <num value="3">3rd</num> of Edward IV., their arms having been granted to them several years before.

<P>The ancient livery hood was crimson and puce. In choosing wardens it was usual at the election dinner to bring in garlands, preceded by minstrels, and try them on each person, till they arrived at the stewards-elect. Worthy Mr. Evelyn (Septumbeer <num value="4">4</num>, <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>) mentions this ceremony, and describes how the solemn procession came to the upper table and drank to the new stewards. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.177.3">The present Ironmongers' Hall</LEMMA> is the <num value="3">third</num> or <num value="4">fourth</num> building erected on the same site. The present hall was designed by T. Holden, in <datestruct value="1748--"><year reg="1748">1748</year></datestruct>. It was then a handsome stone building, with a rustic base and Ionic pilasters, balustraded roof, and carved tympanum.   The vestibule was divided by <num value="6">six</num> Tuscan columns, and the state room was adorned with Ionic ornaments, an orchestra and grand buffet.   The master and wardens' chairs stood   against the west wall, in front of the king's arms, while the blue semi-oval ceiling was stuccoed with heraldic bearings, satyrs' heads, cornucopias, palm-branches, flowers, and   scrolls.   The banqueting-hall has since been decorated in the Louis Quatorze taste, in papier-mache and <hi rend=italics>carton-pierre</hi>
 imitative oak aided by oak carvings. The hall contains portraits of Mr. Thomas Betton (a Turkey merchant, who left. <measure value="26000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="26000">26,000</num></measure>), Sir Robert Geffery (giver of the Company's almshouses in the Kingsland Road), Sir James Cambell, and other benefactors, and a fine full-length of Lords Hood, by Gainsborough, given by that admiral to the Company, in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>, when his lordship was received into the Company without fee or previous nomination.

<P>Mincing Lane was so called from houses there belonging to the <QUOTE>Minchuns,</QUOTE> or nuns, of St. Helen's, Bishopsgate Street. Of old time (says Stow) there dwelt in this lane Genoese traders called <QUOTE>galleymen,</QUOTE> because they brought their wines and other merchandise to Galley Wharf, in Thames Street. They used amongst themselves small silver halfpence called, in London, <QUOTE>galley halfpence,</QUOTE> forbidden by Act of Parliament in the reigns of Henry IV. and Henry VI. These coins were broader than. English halfpence, but not so thick and strong. 
<P>Mincing Lane is specially mentioned by Pepys, 
<hi rend=italics>apropos</hi> of the Great Fire :-- <QUOTE><datestruct VALUE="1668-06-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>between <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="3">three</num> in the morning we were waked with the maids crying out,  <Q>Fire, fire, in Marke Lane!</Q>  So I rose and looked out, and it was dreadful, and strange apprehensions in me and us all of being presently burnt. So we all rose, and my care presently was to secure my gold and plate and papers, and could quickly have done it, but I went forth to see where it was; and the whole town was presently in the streets; and I found it in a new-built house that stood alone in Minchin Lane, over against the Clothworkers' Hall, which burned furiously; the house not yet quite finished; and the benefit of brick was well seen, for it burnt all inward, and fell down within itself; so no fear of doing more hurt.</QUOTE>

 (Henry VI.), ever to remain in their fellowship. The spot is remarkable as the boundary of the Great Fire of London, which partly destroyed the hall. Pepys speaks of the building as being <QUOTE>in <num value="1">one</num> body of flame for <num value="3">three</num> days and nights, the cellars being full of oil.</QUOTE> 
<P>The Clothworkers, says Herbert, seem to have sprung, like the Fullers, from the very ancient guild of Weavers. The trade had formerly several subdivisions, of which the Fullers, the Burrellers, and the Testers were the chief. The Burrellers were inspectors and measurers of cloth. In the reign of Edward IV. the Shearmen were separated from the Drapers and Tailors, and were incorporated. Henry VII. granted them   additional privileges, and Henry VIII. united them with the Fullers, and gave the joint fraternity the name of Clothworkers.   There were endless disputes between the Clothworkers and Dyers for precedence, till at last the Clothworkers settled down as <num value="12">twelfth</num> and last of the great companies, and the Dyers took rank as <num value="1">first</num> of the minor ones. Shearmen, the old title of the Clothworkers, had no reference to removing the wool from the sheep, but applied to the manner of clipping the nap in the process of cloth manufacture.   The Clothworkers are especially mentioned in a statute concerning the woollen manufacture, in the reign of Edward VI., which contained clauses requiring the clothiers' seal on cloth, and forbidding over-stretching, and adding chalk, or flour, or starch, and the use of iron cards. Queen Elizabeth confirmed the right of the Clothworkers, and Charles I. (who, as well as his father, was a member of the fraternity) confirmed their charter. There were <num value="5">five</num> degrees in the Company-apprentices, freemen (also called yeomen and bachelors), householders, the fellowship, and wardens.   The government consisted of a court of assistants, including only those who had been masters and wardens. 
<P>Pepys himself was a member of this Company, and left it a quaint and valuable old cup, which still shines out among the meaner plate, on the occasion of grand dinners, <QUOTE>when beards wag all.</QUOTE> The hall, after the Great Fire, seems to have been restored with green wood, which soon fell into decay.   It must have been a fine building, for the banqueting-hall was a lofty wainscoted room, adorned with a great oak screen, with figures of James I. and Charles I., and <num value="2">two</num> stained-glass windows. These windows contained, among other devices, the arms of Pepys and Sir John Robinson. The latter worthy was Lieutenant of the Tower, President of the Artillery Company, and Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct>, when he entertained, in Clothworkers' Hall, Charles II. and his Queen, the Queen-Dowager, and the Duke and Duchess of York. Mr. Samuel Angell. was the architect of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.179.1">the new hall</LEMMA>, which occupies the old position in Mincing Lane. It was completed in <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct> and is now, with its fine oak carving and splendid mirrors, a good specimen of a Company's Hall--the ceiling, in white and gold, being ornamented in a rather unusual, but most tasteful manner, with life-size figures in relief. At <num value="1">one</num> end of the hall stand the statues of James I. and Charles I., very dazzling in their covering of pure gilding.   The ground on which the hall is built has been enlarged by the addition of a very large piece of land purchased by the Company quite recently. This is the site of the old church and graveyard of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.179.2">Allhallows Staining</LEMMA>   The body of the church itself has been pulled down, and its place is occupied by houses built and let on lease to tenants. The churchyard is to remain as an open space, and will still admit air and light to the hall.   But the old tower still remains; the Company, by arrangement with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, being bound not only not to demolish it, but to keep it in repair. Anything more absurd than this restriction cannot be imagined. The crumbling old tower is not by any means ornamental, and it can serve no purpose on earth except that of obstructing and incommoding the property of the Company. The real estates held by this Company are very large, and comprise a great deal of valuable house property in London. The Irish estates were let as far back as <datestruct value="1769--"><year reg="1769">1769</year></datestruct> for <measure value="600l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="600">600</num></measure> per annum, and a fine of <measure value="28000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="28000">28,000</num></measure>. They have, however, been sold since the last rebuilding of the hall. The Company have schools at Sutton Valence, in Kent, and in the Isle of Man, and almshouses at Sutton Valence, in Islington, and other places.   The charities were estimated in <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct> at about <measure value="1400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1400">1,400</num></measure> per annum, but they are now vastly increased. This Company has numbered many royal personages among its members, and among them   the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge. Prince Albert was also a member, and the Company have a large picture of his late Royal Highness, with a sister painting of Her Majesty, executed by Herrick in <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct>. In proof of the honour in which the Clothworkers were held <num value="2">two</num> centuries ago, we may quote the words of the panegyrist, Elkanah Settle:-- <QUOTE>The grandeur of England is to be attributed to its golden fleece (which is the crest of this Company), the wealth of the loom making England a <num value="2">second</num> Peru, and the back of the sheep, and not the entrails of the earth, being its chief mine of riches. The silkworm is no spinster of ours, and our wheel <pb id="P.179" n="179"> and web are wholly the Clothworkers'. Thus, as trade is the soul of the kingdom, so   the   greatest branch of it lies in the Clothworkers' hands; and though our naval commerce brings us in   both the 
<hi rend=italics>or</hi> and the <hi rend=italics>argent</hi>, and indeed      the   whole wealth of the world, yet, when thoroughly examined, it will be found &lsquo;tis your cloth sends out to fetch them.

<P>At the north-east corner of Mark Lane, says Stow, was the manor of a knight of Richard II., called by the pretty name of Blanch Appleton, afterwards corrupted into Blind Chapel Court.   In the reign of Edward IV. basket-makers and wiredrawers were allowed to practise their trade in Blanch Appleton.   Mark Lane was   originally called Mart Lane, from some fair of uncertain date there established. 
<P>The Church of Allhallows standing in Mark Lane, recently pulled   down by the Clothworkers' Company to enlarge their hall, was given, in <datestruct value="1367--"><year reg="1367">1367</year></datestruct>, by the Bishop of London to the Abbey and Convent of our Lady of Grace, near the Tower of London. The right of presentation eventually came into the possession of the Grocers' Company. According to Stow, the church was called Stane or Stayning; to distinguish it at an early period when many London churches were erected of timber.   The churchwardens' books of Allhallows   are perfect from as far back as <datestruct value="1491--"><year reg="1491">1491</year></datestruct>, and abound with some interesting facts as to prices and manners and customs.   In <datestruct value="1492--"><year reg="1492">1492</year></datestruct> the great beam   light of the church is mentioned as weighing more than <measure value="40l." type=currency><num value="40">40</num> pounds</measure>, and cost <measure value="1d." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>d.</measure> the pound. In <datestruct value="1587--"><year reg="1587">1587</year></datestruct> there is a shilling paid to the ringers for expressing joy at the execution of Mary Queen of Scots.   In <datestruct value="1606--"><year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct> a shilling is paid for painting <num value="3">three</num>   red crosses on the doors of houses infected with the plague.

The church escaped the Great Fire, but, as if tired of standing, fell down suddenly in <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>,   nearly burying a sexton who was digging a grave. The tower contains <num value="6">six</num> bells, the greater number of which   are dated <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct>-<num value="3">3</num>. <num value="2">Two</num> of them, however, are much older. Malcolm says the date upon <num value="1">one</num> is <datestruct value="1485--"><year reg="1485">1485</year></datestruct>. 
<P>The Corn   Exchange in Mark Lane was projected and opened in <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct>.   <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.179.3">A new Exchange</LEMMA> was rebuilt by Mr. G. Smith in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, and   opened the next year. It is now again proposed to rebuild it. On building the <num value="2">second</num> Corn Exchange a fine Roman pavement was discovered.    The old Exchange, still standing in Mark Lane, has an open colonnade with modern Doric   pillars.      The factors have stands in the interior court, which has been compared to the atrium, or place of audience, of a Pompeian house.   The New Corn Exchange is in the Grecian and Doric style.   The interior is lighted by a lantern with vertical lights in the centre space within the columns, and the compartments on each side have skylights in their ceilings.   The stands of the corn-factors, to the number of <num value="80">eighty</num> and upwards, are along the sides of the building.   On them are placed small bags and wooden bowls, with samples of different kinds of grain, and behind is a desk for the factor or his clerk, with something of the convenience of a counting-house.   Lightermen   and granarykeepers have stands   as well as corn-merchants, factors, and millers. The seed-market is held in another part of the building. In the north wing is a tavern and coffee-room, and an opening in the south side of the wing communicates with the old Corn Exchange. 
<P>As some London corn merchants were said, as far back as <num value="30">thirty</num> years ago, to turn over in a year nearly a million and a half of money, it may be supposed that Mark Lane is a strictly busy place, and that the factors there do not scoop up handfuls of corn or toss wheat up in the air for mere amusement.   In <num value="2">two</num> months alone in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct> there arrived in London <num value="787">787</num> vessels from foreign ports, laden with foreign corn, a fact which proves the ceaseless cry for bread of hungry England, unable to fully supply its own wants, and dependent on the energy of the Mark Lane dealers. 
<P>In the Middle Ages, London, a mere bantling then, with no great appetite, depended in simple faith for corn on Kent and Essex alone. In   Stow's <pb id="P.180" n="180"> time Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Kent, and Sussex were the chief competitors in the London corn trade. Speculators in corn were looked upon in old times with suspicion, and even detestation; while regraters, or holders back of corn, were formerly branded as ruthless enemies of the human race. In <datestruct value="1542--"><year reg="1542">1542</year></datestruct> corn dealers were prohibited having more than <num value="10">ten</num> quarters in their possession at <num value="1">one</num> time, and justices could examine a farmer's barns and sell the superfluous stock. Heavy penalties were inflicted <num value="2">two</num> years afterwards on persons who bought corn to sell again. Farmers buying corn for seed were required to sell an equal quantity of store corn; while corn dealers were required to take out an annual licence, and not to engross or forestall, or buy out of open market, except under an express permission. 
<P>Dearths frequently occurring in the Middle Ages, the livery companies were required to keep stores of corn, as we have already mentioned in previous chapters. Sir Stephen Brown is the <num value="1">first</num> Lord Mayor praised by Stow   for sending to Dantzic for cheap corn in time of scarcity, and Sir

 Simon Eyre, another Lord Mayor, established a public granary, such as Joseph did in Egypt, at Leadenhall.   In <datestruct value="1521--"><year reg="1521">1521</year></datestruct> a mayor found the City granaries nearly empty, and had to lay in a provision of wheat. In <datestruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct> <num value="2">two</num> aldermen were appointed weekly in rotation to see that the markets were well supplied. When prices rose the companies were compelled to send in for sale certain specified quantities of corn, and then to provide a fresh stock.   In <datestruct value="1590--"><year reg="1590">1590</year></datestruct>, they were called on, at <num value="2">two</num> different periods, to purchase <num value="18000">18,000</num> quarters.   The Bridgemaster had the charge of buying the corn, which was at <num value="1">one</num> period entirely stored in the Bridge House. The money to purchase the grain for the City granaries was raised by loans and contributions from the mayor and aldermen, the City companies, and sometimes from the citizens. The companies often grumbled, clamoured for a return of their money, and were sometimes paid in store corn, which they by no means wanted. In <datestruct value="1596--"><year reg="1596">1596</year></datestruct> the companies built their own granaries, and were allowed to keep their supply there. The difficulty with the companies grew worse and worse, <pb id="P.181" n="181"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.181.1">St. Michael's, Queenhithe</LEMMA></NOTE>
 and the refusals to buy corn became more frequent, till at last the Great Fire, that fierce reformer of many abuses, swept away the Bridge House and all the other granaries, and thus at last the custom of laying up corn and interfering with the natural balance of trade ceased altogether. 
<P>The German Steel Yard merchants were at <num value="1">one</num> period the sole importers of foreign corn, and in times of scarcity were not allowed to sell either to bakers or brewers without the City's licence. 
<P>In <num value="1">one</num> special year bakers were forbidden to buy any meal, except at the City's store, the Bridge House, where the quantity each might take, and the price, were fixed by the Lord Mayor. Such were the fetters in which trade had to move in the time of Queen Elizabeth, when so many feudal restrictions were still in existence. As an instance of the power of the City in the reign of her successor, it has been mentioned that in <datestruct value="1622--"><year reg="1622">1622</year></datestruct> the Court tried to borrow <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> quarters of wheat, and the City would only lend <num value="10">ten</num>. 
<P>The ancient corn-ports of London were, as we have shown, Queenhithe and Billingsgate. The chief corn-warehouse was at Queenhithe. There was a principal meter there, and <num value="8">eight</num> master porters, <num value="64">64</num>

 each of whom had <num value="3">three</num> men under him. The chief corn-markets of London were Cornhill and Michael-le-Quern, at the west end of Cheapside. Bread Street was the mediaeval bakers' market. The Fellowship of Bakers held <num value="4">four</num> hall-motes during the year, to punish offences of their craft. In <datestruct value="1370--"><year reg="1370">1370</year></datestruct> a Stratford baker, for selling loaves smaller than the assize, was drawn on a hurdle through London streets with a fool's cap on his head, while round his neck dangled his meagre loaves. 
<P>The old assize of bread compelled bakers to regulate the size of thier loaves by the price of corn. The assize was regulated in Queen Anne's reign, and not finally abolished till <datestruct value="1815"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>. The Bakers' Company used formerly to present <num value="2">two</num> newbaked loaves to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, to be fairly weighed. They were made out of wheaten corn, purchased by <num value="4">four</num> <QUOTE>sworn and discreet men</QUOTE> at the markets of Grasschurch, St. Botolph, Bishopsgate, and Queenhithe.   London bakers were formerly, except at Christmas, forbidden to sell household loaves at a higher price than twopence, or to sell by retail spice-cakes, buns, or biscuits, except for funerals, and at the festivals of Christmas and Easter. <pb id="P.182" n="182"> 
<P>The London corn-mills were latterly chiefly at London Bridge.   Besides Leadenhall and the Bridge House there were granaries at <num value="1">one</num> time at Bridewell and Christchurch. At the beginning of the last century the metropolitan corn-market was held at Bear Quay, in Thames Street. Queenhithe was at the same period the great market for flour and meal, and the <QUOTE>White Horse</QUOTE> Inn mealmarket, situated near Holborn Bridge, was much frequented. 
<P>The system of factorage is only about <num value="180">180</num> years old. Tradition has it that it began with a number of Essex farmers, who used to leave samples of corn with the landlord of an inn at Whitechapel where they put up, and to whom they paid commission, to save the trouble of attending the market every week. The ancestors of <num value="1">one</num> of the oldest commission-houses began with a stand on Tower Hill. 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Such great events from little causes spring.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Kentish, Essex, and Suffolk corn arrives in sacks; foreign and Irish corn, and English oats and barley in loose bulk.   The Kentish hoys sometimes bring joint-stock cargoes. The operation of unloading and measuring was, under the old system, very skilfully managed.   <num value="2">Two</num> fellowship porters all but filled the bushel with wooden shovels, the meter completed the bushel, and <num value="1">one</num> of the men passed the strike over the surface. The sack was then filled and shot into the lighter. At purchase the grain was again measured. 
<P>By a recent Act of Parliament the City's rights of measuring corn, worth as much as <measure value="13000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="13000">13,000</num></measure> a year, were done away with. Corn is now sold by weight, the only charge being <num value="3">three</num>-sixteenths of a penny per hundredweight, to pay for the ex-sworn meters, as compensation to the City, this charge to continue for <num value="30">thirty</num> years. 
<P>The London   terms of the factors are <num value="1">one</num> month's open credit, and the buyer has to lodge any objection as to quality, bulk, &amp;c., at the factor's stand before <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock on the following market day, or else has to abide by his bargain.   The centre of the market is devoted, at the entrance end, to shipbrokers of all classes, and also to masters of small craft, and lightermen; in the middle assemble the great Greek merchants, who almost monopolise the importation of corn from every part of the world; they here give directions to factors who are selling their arrived cargoes, and to agents who are negotiating with country merchants and factors from all parts of the kingdom, either personally or by telegraph, for the sale of cargoes shipping   at foreign ports, or on passage, or arrived on the coast at Plymouth or Queenstown. There are sometimes as many as <num value="100">100</num> cargoes at ports of call, the size of each <num value="1">one</num> being from <num value="4000">4,000</num> to <num value="5000">5,000</num> quarters up to <num value="8000">8,000</num> quarters, and sometimes as much as <num value="13000">13,000</num> quarters, waiting for a destination, which is notified to them by telegraph as soon as a contract is made. Not only is the United Kingdom supplied in this way, but also any part of the Continent where corn may be required. 
<P>The upper part of the market is the place of assembling for oil seed-crushers, and here the Greeks again are the great importers of all kinds of oil-seeds. 
<P>A strict and punctual system governs all the proceedings of the establishment. The market opens at <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock by ring of bell, and factors never name a price for goods till then. At <num value="2">two</num> o'clock a notice bell is rung, and at half-past <num value="2">two</num> the final bell, when the doors of the market are closed until <num value="3">three</num>, when the sweepers begin to clear up the spilt samples, which bring in a good revenue to the company. 
<P>The next market adjoining, and in communication with the old Exchange, is the <QUOTE>London Corn Exchange,</QUOTE> which is commonly called the New Corn Market, to distinguish it from the other. The exterior is much more imposing than the old market, which is very simple. Originally some dealers clubbed together and acquired some property opposite the old Exchange, and in opposition to it, and set up a few small stands, but they subsequently formed a company, and acquired the present site. This may be called the retail market, as the standholders are principally dealers, who sell corn lying in their own river-side warehouses to shopkeepers, livery-stables, &amp;c., and they buy, generally from factors on the old market, the grain ex-ship. Some of these dealers are also factors in the old market. Here also the malt-factors and maltsters attend, as the Greeks do in the other market; and also a great many country dealers, who sell home-grown barley.   The stands are arranged round the interior, and smaller stands fill up the centre opening. 
<P>A staircase at the entrance of the old Exchange, and the property of the same company, leads to <QUOTE>Jack's Coffee House,</QUOTE> the assembly for London and country millers, who examine their purchases, &amp;c., after the market is over. The room is crammed between <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="4">four</num> o'clock. At the rear of the old Exchange is a handsome building, which was erected in <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>; the upper storeys are divided into offices, and the ground-floor forms a large subscription-room. <pb id="P.183" n="183"> 
<P>Granaries are numerous about Bermondsey and Shad Thames, but they abound on both sides of the river, from Greenwich to Vauxhall. The foreign corn is stored in bonded granaries near the Commercial Docks. In the times of the high duties corn-merchants have been known to throw <num value="2000">2,000</num> quarters of wheat into the river at <num value="1">one</num> time rather than pay the high tax, or keep it subject to long granary rent. 
<P>The supply of foreign corn to this country has undergone many changes from time to time; formerly our supplies were chiefly from the Baltic and South Russian ports, but now the United States is the chief contributor, and we also get wheat from Australia, California, the Cape, and New Zealand. 
<P>The cultivation of grain has undergone a marvellous change since   <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, the English farmer preferring cattle-rearing to corn-growing: thus in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct> the supply of foreign corn to the port of London, as measured by the sworn meters, was <num value="1132580">1,132,580</num>   quarters, and of English <num value="3154270">3,154,270</num> quarters; whereas, in the year <datestruct value="1871"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct> the quantities were, foreign, <num value="2471394">2,471,394</num> quarters; English, <num value="662567">662,567</num> quarters. The total of foreign grain and flour imported into London during <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct> was <num value="20400905">20,400,905</num> cwts., according to Custom House Returns. 
<P>No. <num value="33">33</num>, Mark Lane, opposite the Corn Exchange, is a large and very ancient house, with fine oak carving over the gateway, and inside. Horses used to be lodged inside the gateway, and there are still the wooden pegs used for hanging up saddles and harness. This house must have been the residence of a great City grandee.

<P> <QUOTE>It does not appear to be ascertained where the East India Company <num value="1">first</num> transacted their business,</QUOTE> says an historian of the great Company, but the tradition of the house is, that it was in the great room of the <QUOTE>Nag's Head Inn,</QUOTE> opposite Bishop'sgate Church, where there is now a Quakers' Meeting House.   The maps of London constructed soon after the Great Fire place the India House in Leadenhall Street, on a part of its present site. It is probably <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.183.6">the house, of which a unique plate is preserved</LEMMA>   in the British Museum, surmounted by a huge, square-built mariner, and <num value="2">two</num> thick dolphins.   In the indenture of conveyance of the dead stock of the Company, dated <datestruct VALUE="1702-07-22"><day reg="22">22nd</day> <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1702">1702</year></datestruct>, we find that Sir William Craven, of Kensington, in the year <datestruct value="1701"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>, leased to the Company his large house in Leadenhall Street, and a tenement in Lime Street, for <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years, at <num value="100">100</num> a year. Upon the site of this house what is called the old East India House was built in <datestruct value="1726--"><year reg="1726">1726</year></datestruct>; and several portions of   <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.183.7">this old house</LEMMA> long remained, although the subsequent front, and great part of the house, were added in <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, by Mr. Jupp. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.183.8">The facade of the old building</LEMMA> was <num value="200">200</num> feet in length, and was of stone. The portico was composed of <num value="6">six</num> large Ionic fluted columns on a raised basement, and it gave an air of much magnificence to the whole, although the closeness of the street made it somewhat gloomy. The pediment was an emblematic sculpture by Bacon, representing the commerce of the East protected by the King of Great Britain, who stood in the centre of a number of figures, holding a shield stretched over them. On the apex of the pediment rose a statue of Britannia. Asia, seated on a dromedary, was at the left corner, and Europe, on horseback, at the right. 
<P> <QUOTE>The ground floor,</QUOTE> says a writer in Knight's 
<title>London,</title> describing the old India House in <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>,

The Court of Directors occupy what is usually termed the  <Q>Court Room,</Q>  while that in which the Court of Proprietors assemble is called the  <Q>General Court Room.</Q>  The Court Room is said to be an exact cube of <num value="30">thirty</num> feet; it is splendidly ornamented by gilding and by large looking-glasses; and the effect of its too great height is much diminished by the position of the windows near the ceiling. <num value="6">Six</num> large pictures hang from the cornice, representing the <num value="3">three</num> Presidencies, the Cape, St. Helena, and Tellicherry. A fine piece of sculpture, in white marble, is fixed over the chimney; Britannia is <pb id="P.184" n="184"> seated on a globe by the sea-shore, receiving homage from <num value="3">three</num> female figures, intended for Asia, Africa, and India.   Asia offers spices with her right hand, and with her left leads a camel; India presents a large box of jewels, which she holds half open; and Africa rests her hand upon the head of a lion. The Thames, as a river-god, stands upon the shore, a labourer appears cording a large bale of merchandise, and ships are sailing in the distance. The whole is supported by <num value="2">two</num> caryatid figures, intended for Brahmins, but really fine old European-looking philosophers. 
<P>The General Court Room, which until the abolition of the trade was the old sale-room, is close to the Court Room. Its east side is occupied by rows of seats which rise from the floor near the middle of the room towards the ceiling, backed by a gallery where the public are admitted. On the floor are the seats for the chairman, secretary, and clerks. Against the west wall, in niches, are <num value="6">six</num> statues of persons who have distinguished themselves in the Company's service; Lord Clive, Warren Hastings, and the Marquis Cornwallis occupy those on the left, and Sir Eyre Coote, General Lawrance, and Sir George Pococke those on the right.   It is understood that the statue of the Marquis Wellesley will be placed in the vacant space in the middle. The Finance and Home Committee Room is the best room in the house, with the exception of the Court Rooms, and is decorated with some good pictures.   <num value="1">One</num> wall is entirely occupied by a representation of the grant of the Dewannee to the Company in <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, the foundation of all the British Power in India; portraits of Warren Hastings and of the Marquis Cornwallis stand beside the fireplace; and the remaining walls are occupied by other pictures, among which may be noticed the portrait of Mirza Abul Hassan, the Persian Envoy, who excited a good deal of attention in London in the year <datestruct value="1809"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>. The upper part of the house contains the principal offices and the library and museum.   In the former is, perhaps, the most splendid collection of Oriental MSS. in Europe, and, in addition, a copy of almost every printed work relating to Asia.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Our trade with India may date its real commencement from the last day of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, when <num value="215">215</num> London merchant adventurers, elated by the capture of a Portuguese ship laden with Indian gold, pearls, spices, silks, and ivory, obtained a charter to trade with Hindostan for <num value="15">fifteen</num> years. King James, with some reluctance (being, no doubt, tampered with by courtiers), renewed the charter, in <datestruct value="1609--"><year reg="1609">1609</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>for ever,</QUOTE> providing that it might be recalled on <num value="3">three</num> years' notice from the Crown. In <datestruct value="1612--"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>, after <num value="12">twelve</num> voyages had been made to the East Indies, the whole capital subscribed, amounting to <measure value="429000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="429000">429,000</num></measure>, was united, and the management taken out of the hands of the original <num value="24">twenty-four</num> managers. The Company suffered at <num value="1">first</num> from the ordinary rapacity and injustice of the Stuarts. In <datestruct value="1623--"><year reg="1623">1623</year></datestruct> (James I.), just as a fleet was starting for India, the Duke of Buckingham   (then   High Admiral) refused to allow it to sail till the Company had paid up a disputed Admiralty claim of <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>, and <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> claimed by the king. In <datestruct value="1635--"><year reg="1635">1635</year></datestruct>, Charles I., breaking the charter, allowed a Captain Weddell, for some heavy bribe, to trade to India for <num value="5">five</num> years. In <datestruct value="1640--"><year reg="1640">1640</year></datestruct>, the same unjust king compelled the Company (on bonds never entirely paid) to sell him their whole stock of Indian pepper in their warehouses, which he instantly re-sold at a lower price, at an eventual loss of <num value="50000">50,000</num>. In <datestruct value="1655--"><year reg="1655">1655</year></datestruct> the Republican Government, nobly antagonistic to royal monopolies, from which the people had so long groaned, under both the Tudors and the Stuarts, threw the trade to India entirely open, but the Company was reinstated in its power <num value="2">two</num> years afterwards. In <datestruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>, Charles II. (no doubt for a pretty handsome consideration) granted the Company a fresh charter, with the new and great privilege of making peace or war. Now the Company's wings began to grow in earnest. In <datestruct value="1653--"><year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>, Madras was made a presidency; in <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, Bombay was ceded to England by the Portuguese, who gave it to Charles as part of the dower of poor ill-starred Catherine of Braganza; and in <datestruct value="1692--"><year reg="1692">1692</year></datestruct> Calcutta was purchased by the ambitious traders, who now began to feel their power, and the possibilities of their new colony. From <datestruct value="1690--"><year reg="1690">1690</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1693--"><year reg="1693">1693</year></datestruct> there were great disputes as to whether the king or Parliament had the right of granting trade charters; and on William III. granting the Company (rich enough now to excite jealousy) a new charter for <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years, an angry inquiry was instituted by the Tories, who discovered that the Company had distributed <num value="90000">90,000</num> among the chief officers of state. A prorogation of Parliament dropped the curtain on these shameful disclosures. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct> the old Company was dissolved, and a new Company (which had outbid the old in bribes) was founded, rivalled, in <datestruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct>, by the old Company, which had obtained a partial resumption of its powers. In <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, however, the <num value="2">two</num> Companies, which had only injured each other, were united, and called <QUOTE>The United Company of Merchants of England, trading to the East Indies,</QUOTE> a title which it retained till its trading privileges were abolished, in <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>. On the renewal of the charter in <datestruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct> (George III.), the Government made important <pb id="P.185" n="185"> changes in the charter, and required all despatches to be submitted to them before they were forwarded to India. The Government was already jealous of the imperial power of a Company which had the possibility of conquering <num value="176">176</num> millions of people. In <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct> the blow indeed came, with the establishment of the Board of Control, <QUOTE>by which, in everything but patronage and trade,</QUOTE> says a well-informed writer on the subject, <QUOTE>the Company's Court of Directors was rendered subordinate to the Government</QUOTE> of the time being. In <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct> private merchants were allowed to export goods in the Company's ships, another big slice out of the cake. By the year <datestruct value="1833"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct> the private trading had begun to exceed, in value of goods, those carried by the Company. In <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct> an Act was passed to enable the Company to retain power until <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>, but abolishing the China monopoly, and all trading. This was cutting off the legs of the Company, and, in fact, preparing it for death. Their warehouses and most of their property were then sold, and the dividend was to be <num value="10.50">10 1/2</num> per cent., chargeable on the revenues of India, and redeemable by Parliament after the year <datestruct value="1874"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>.   The amount of dividend guaranteed by the Act was <measure value="630000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="630000">630,000</num></measure>, being <num value="10.50">10 1/2</num> per cent. on a nominal capital of   <num value="6000000">6,000,000</num>. The real capital of the Company was estimated, in <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>, at upwards of <measure value="21000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="21000000">21,000,000</num></measure>, including cash, goods, and buildings, and <measure value="1294768l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1294768">1,294,768</num></measure> as the estimated value of the East India House and the Company's warehouses, the prime cost of the latter having been <measure value="1100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1100000">1,100,000</num></measure>. The Company was henceforth to be entitled the East India Company, and its accounts were to be annually laid before Parliament. The old privileges of the Company were now limited. 
<P>The General Court of Proprietors was formerly composed of the owners of India stock. After <datestruct value="1693--"><year reg="1693">1693</year></datestruct> no <num value="1">one</num> who had less than <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> stock could vote. Later still, the qualification was lowered to <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>, and the greatest holders had ho more. By the last law (that of <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>) the possession of <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> only gave <num value="1">one</num> vote; <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure>, <num value="2">two</num>; <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure>, <num value="3">three</num>; and <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> the greatest number allowed--namely, <num value="4">four</num>. The Court of Proprietors elected the Court of Directors, framed bye-laws, declared the dividends, and controlled grants of money above <measure value="600l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="600">600</num></measure>, and additions to salary above <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure>.   Latterly the functions of this general court were entirely deliberative, and the vote was by ballot. In <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct> there were <num value="1880">1,880</num> members of the Court of Proprietors. The meetings in old times were very stormy, and even riotous; the debates virulent. In <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct>, Clive, as unscrupulous as he was brave, laid out <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure> in India stock, to introduce nominees of his own, who would vote at his pleasure. The directors were then appointed annually; latterly they were elected for <num value="4">four</num> years, <num value="6">six</num> retiring yearly, and the chairman and deputy-chairman, who communicated with the Government, did the greater part of the work. 
<P>The Board of Control, established by the Act of <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct>, was nominated by the Crown, and (after <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>) consisted of an unlimited number of members, all of whom, except <num value="2">two</num>, were to be of the Privy Council, including the <num value="2">two</num> principal Secretaries of State and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. <num value="3">Three</num> only of the commissioners were paid, and all changed with the Ministry. They had supreme power to keep or send despatches; had access to all books, accounts, papers, and documents in the East India House, orders, or secret despatches; and communicated with the Secret Committee. 
<P>In old times <QUOTE>John Company</QUOTE> employed nearly <num value="4000">4,000</num> men in its warehouses, and, before the trade with India closed, kept more than <num value="400">400</num> clerks to transact the business of this greatest company that the world had ever seen. The military department superintended the recruiting and storing of the Indian army. There was a shipping department, a master-attendant's office, an auditor's office, an examiner's office, an accountant's office, a transfer office, and a treasury. The buying office governed the <num value="14">fourteen</num> warehouses, and so worked the home market, having often in store some <num value="50">fifty</num> million pounds weight of tea, <num value="1200000">1,200,000</num> lbs. being sometimes sold in <num value="1">one</num> day, at the annual tea sales. The tea and indigo sales were bear-garden scenes. 
<P>The despatches and letters from India poured ceaselessly into the India House.

In a debate on East India matters, in <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>, Canning mentioned, in eulogy of the Company's clever and careful clerks, that he had known <num value="1">one</num> military despatch accompanied by <num value="119">119</num> papers, and containing altogether <num value="13511">13,511</num> pages. These were the men who had heard of Clive and Warren Hastings, and remembered that Macaulay had spoken of Indian writers as fallen from their high estate, because then (<datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>) they could only expect, at <num value="45">forty-five</num>, to return to England with <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> a year pension and <measure value="39000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="39000">39,000</num></measure> of savings.

<P>Lime Street, Leadenhall Street, is supposed to have got its name from lime having been once upon a time sold there.

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 
<P>The original Leadenhall Market was a mansion which belonged to Sir Hugh Neville, in <datestruct value="1309--"><year reg="1309">1309</year></datestruct>, and was converted into a granary, and probably a market for the City, by Sir Simon Eyre, a draper, and Lord Mayor of London in <datestruct value="1445--"><year reg="1445">1445</year></datestruct>. It appears to have been a large building roofed with lead, and at that time thought, we presume, grand and remarkable. 
<P>There was a large chapel on the east side of old Leadenhall Market, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, by Sir Simon Eyre. To this chapel were attached, for daily service of the market people, master, <num value="5">five</num> secular priests, <num value="6">six</num> clerks, <num value="2">two</num> choristers, and <num value="3">three</num> schoolmasters, for whose support Eyre left <measure value="3000bmark" type=currency><num value="3000">3,000</num> marks</measure>. In the reign of Edward IV. a fraternity of <num value="60">sixty</num> priests was established in this chapel. During a scarcity in <datestruct value="1512--"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct> (Henry VIII.) a great store of corn was laid up in the Leadenhall granary, and the mayor used to attend the market at <num value="4">four</num> a.m. In the year <datestruct value="1534"><year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct> it was proposed to make Leadenhall a merchants' Bourse, but the plan dropped through. At Henry VIII.'s death, in <datestruct value="1547--"><year reg="1547">1547</year></datestruct>, the Bishop of Winchester, the king's almoner, gave alms publicly to the poor at Leadenhall for <num value="12">twelve</num> consecutive days.   In Strype's time <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.188.1">Leadenhall (now celebrated for its poultry</LEMMA>) was a market for meat and fish, a market for raw hides, a wool market, and an herb market. 
<P> <QUOTE>The use of Leadenhall, in my youth,</QUOTE> says Strype, <QUOTE>was thus :--In a part of the north quadrant, on the east side of the north gate, were the common beams for weighing of wool and other wares, as <pb id="P.189" n="189"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.189.1">Old Houses-Leadenhall Street</LEMMA></NOTE>
 had been accustomed; on the west side the gate was the scales to weigh meal; the other <num value="3">three</num> sides were reserved (for the most part) to the making and resting of the pageants shewed at Midsummer in, the watch. The remnant of the sides and quadrants were employed for the stowage of woolsacks, but not closed up; the lofts above were partly used by the painters in working for the decking of pageants and other devices, for beautifying of the watch and watchmen. The residue of the lofts were letten out to merchants, the woolwinders and packers therein to wind and pack their wools.</QUOTE> 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.189.2">Leadenhall Market</LEMMA>, says Pennant, <QUOTE>is the wonder of foreigners, who do not duly consider the carnivorous nation to which it belongs.</QUOTE> When Don Pedro de Ronquillo, the Spanish ambassador, visited Leadenhall, he told Charles II. with admiration that he believed there was more meat sold in that market than in all the kingdom of Spain in a whole year. In <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct> Leadenhall Market was partly rebuilt, and in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct> the leather-market was restored, the chapel and other old buildings being removed. 
<P>The engraving on page <num value="186">186</num> shows an old house formerly standing in Leadenhall Street. The door at the side appears to have been the entrance to an old Jewish synagogue. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.189.3">St. Catherine Cree (or Christ Church)</LEMMA> is the memorable building where Archbishop Laud performed some of those dangerous ceremonials that ultimately contributed to bring him to the scaffold. Between the years <datestruct value="1280--"><year reg=1280>1280</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1303--"><year reg=1303>1303</year></datestruct> this church was built as a chapel for the parish of St. Catherine, in the churchyard of the priory of the Holy Trinity, Christ Church, founded by Matilda, wife of Henry I., who united the parishes of St. Mary Magdalen, St. Michael, St. Catherine, and the Trinity. Of the church of St. Michael (at the angle formed by the junction of Leadenhall and Fenchurch Streets) the crypt existed at the date of Mr. Godwin's writing in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>, with pointed arched groining and clustered columns, the shafts of which were said to be sunk about <num value="14">fourteen</num> feet deep in the earth. 
<P>Henry VIII., at the dissolution, gave the priory and the church to Lord Audley, who bequeathed it to Magdalen College, Cambridge. In Stow's time the high street had been so often raised by pavements round St. Catherine's, that those who entered had to descend <num value="7">seven</num> steps. In the year <datestruct value="1628"><year reg="1628">1628</year></datestruct> the church, all but the tower was pulled down, and the present building commenced. The new building was consecrated by Archbishop Laud, then Bishop of London, <datestruct VALUE="1630-01-16"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=16>16</day>, <year reg=1630>1630</year></datestruct>-<num value="31">31</num>.   Rushworth gives the following account of the opening: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>St. Catherine Cree Church being lately repaired, was suspended from all divine service, sermons, and sacraments, till it was consecrated. Wherefore Dr. Laud, Lord Bishop of London, on the <datestruct value="01-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, being the Lord's Day, came thither in the morning to consecrate the same. Now, because great exceptions were taken at the formality thereof, we will briefly relate the manner of the consecration. At the bishop's approach to the west door of the church, some that were prepared for it cried with a loud voice,  <Q>Open, open, ye everlasting doors, that the King of Glory may come in.</Q>  And presently the doors were opened, and the bishop, with <num value="3">three</num> doctors, and many other principal men, went in, and immediately falling down upon his knees, with his eyes lifted up, and his arms spread abroad, uttered these words:  <Q>This place is holy, this ground is holy; in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I pronounce it holy.</Q>  Then he took up some of the dust, and threw it up into the air several times in his going up towards the church. When they approached near to the rail and communion-table, the bishop bowed towards it several times, and returning they went round the church in procession, saying the Hundredth Psalm, after that the Nineteenth Psalm, and then said a form of prayer,  <Q>Lord Jesus Christ,</Q>  &amp;c.; and concluding,  <Q>We consecrate this church, and separate it unto Thee, as holy ground, not to be profaned any more to common use.</Q>  After this, the bishop being near the communion-table, and taking a written book in his hand, pronounced curses upon those that should afterwards profane that holy place, by musters of soldiers, or keeping profane law-courts, or carrying burdens through it; and at the end of every curse he bowed towards the east, and said,  <Q>Let all the people say, Amen.</Q>  When the curses were ended, he pronounced a number of blessings upon all those that had any hand in framing and building of that sacred church, and those that had given, or should hereafter give, chalices, plate, ornaments, or utensils; and at the end of every blessing he bowed towards the east, saying,  <Q>Let all the people say, Amen.</Q>  
<P>After this followed the sermon, which being ended, the bishop consecrated and administered the sacrament in manner following:--As he approached the communion-table he made several lowly bowings, and coming up to the side of the table where the bread and wine were covered, he bowed <num value="7">seven</num> times; and then, after the reading of many prayers, he came near the bread, and gently lifted up the corner of the napkin wherein the bread were laid; and when he beheld the bread. he laid it down again, flew back a step or <num value="2">two</num>, bowed <num value="3">three</num> several times towards it. Then he drew <pb id="P.190" n="190"> near again, and opened the napkin and bowed as before. Then he laid his hand on the cup, which was full of wine, with a cover upon it, which he let go again, went back, and bowed thrice towards it; then he came near again, and lifting up the cover of the cup, looked into it, and seeing the wine, he let fall the cover again, retired back, and bowed as before. Then he received the sacrament, and gave it to some principal men; after which, many prayers being said, the solemnity of the consecration ended.</QUOTE>
 
<P>In the Middle Ages morality plays were acted in the churchyard of St. Catherine Cree. In an old parish book, quoted by Malcolm, under the date <datestruct value="1565"><year reg="1565">1565</year></datestruct>, there is an entry of certain players, who for licence to play their interludes in the churchyard paid the sum of <measure value="27s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="27">27</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> 
<P>The most interesting ceremonial to be witnessed in this church is the annual <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.190.1"> <QUOTE>flower sermon</QUOTE> </LEMMA> on Whit-Monday, which is largely attended: the congregation all wear flowers, and a large bouquet is placed on the pulpit before the preacher. 
<P>It is generally thought by good authorities that this church was restored under the direction of Inigo Jones. The building displays a strange mixture of Gothic and Greek architecture, yet is still not without a certain picturesqueness. The east window is square-headed; Corinthian columns support a clerestory, and the groined ceiling is coarse and ugly. The chief monument in the church is <num value="1">one</num> to the memory of Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, chief butler of England, a chamberlain, and

At the west end is an indifferent bas-relief by the elder Bacon. There is also a man more illustrious than these said to be buried here, and that is the great Holbein. The great painter is said to have died in the parish of St. Andrew Undershaft, and Strype gives this as the place of his interment, adding that the Earl of Arundel had wished to erect a monument to his memory, but was unable to discover the exact spot of his grave.

<P>St. Mary Axe, so called originally from a shop with the sign of an axe, is a street which runs from Lime Street into Camomile Street, on the line of the old Roman wall, and so named (like Wormwood Street) from the rough herbs that grew among the old Roman stones. The church of St. Mary, long since vanished, was, says Stow, after the union of the parish with that of St. Andrew Undershaft, turned into a warehouse.

 Near this spot stood, in the reign of Henry V., the London residence of the De Veres, Earls of Oxford. Richard, Earl of Oxford, fought at Agincourt, and died in France, <datestruct value="1417--"><year reg="1417">1417</year></datestruct>, <num value="2">two</num> years after that great victory. 
<P>In Leadenhall Street, opposite the East India House, in <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, was found the most magnificent Roman tessellated pavement yet discovered in London. It lay at only <num value="9">nine</num> and a half feet below the street, but a <num value="3">third</num> side had been cut away for a sewer. It appeared to have been the floor of a room more than <num value="20">twenty</num> feet square. In the centre was Bacchus upon a tiger, encircled with <num value="3">three</num> borders (inflexions of serpents, cornucopiae, and squares diagonally concave), with drinking-cups and plants at the angles. Surrounding the whole was a square border of a bandeau of oak, and lozenge figures and true-lover's knots, and a fivefeet outer margin of plain red tiles. The pavement was broken in taking up, but the pieces were preserved in the library of the East India Company. A fragment of an urn and a jawbone were found beneath <num value="1">one</num> corner. <QUOTE>In this beautiful specimen of Roman Mosaic,</QUOTE> says Mr. Fisher, who published a coloured print of it, <QUOTE>the drawing, colouring, and shadows are all effected by about <num value="20">twenty</num> separate tints, composed of tessellae of different materials, the major part of which are baked earths; but the more brilliant colours of green and purple, which form the drapery, are of glass. These tessellae are of different sizes and figures, adapted to the situations they occupy in the design.</QUOTE> In connection with this interesting discovery, it may be mentioned that another fine Roman pavement, <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> feet square, was found in <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct> in Old Broad Street, on taking down the Excise Office. It lay about <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet lower than the foundations of Gresham   House, on the site of which the Excise Office was built. <QUOTE>It is,</QUOTE> says a description of it inserted by Mr. Timbs, in his <title>Curiosities</title>, <QUOTE>a geometrical pattern of broad blue lines, forming intersections of octagon and lozenge compartments. The octagon figures are bordered with a cable pattern, shaded with grey, and interlaced with a square border shaded with red and yellow. In the centres, within a ring, are expanded flowers, shaded in red, yellow, and grey, the double row of leaves radiating from a figure called a true-love knot, alternately with a figure something like the tigerlily. Between the octagon figures are square compartments bearing various devices. In the centre of the pavement is Ariadne or a Bacchante, reclining on the back of a panther, but only the fore-paws, <num value="1">one</num> of the hind-paws, and the tail, remain.   Over the head of the figure floats a light drapery, forming an arch. Another square contains a <num value="2">two</num>-handled vase. On the demi-octagons, at the sides of the pattern, are lunettes; <num value="1">one</num> contains a fan ornament; another, a bowl crowned with flowers. The lozenge intersections are variously embellished with leaves, shells, true-love knots, chequers, and an ornament shaped   like a dice-box.   At the corners of the pattern are true-love knots. Surrounding this pattern is a broad cable-like border, broad bands of blue and white alternating, then a floral scroll, and beyond this an edge of demi-lozenges, in alternate blue and white.   An outer border composed   of plain red tessellae, surrounds the whole.   The ground of the pavement is white, and the other colours are a scale of full red, yellow, and a bluish grey.   This pavement is of late workmanship. Various Roman and mediaeval articles were turned up in the same excavation; among these were a silver denarius of Hadrian, several copper coins of Constantine, and a small copper coin bearing, on the reverse, the figures of Romulus and Remus suckled by the traditionary wolf; several Roman and mediaeval tiles and fragments of pottery; a small glass of a fine blue colour, and coins and tradesmen's tokens were also found.</QUOTE> <NOTE resp=grc>Quote missing in original.</NOTE>
 
<P>Perhaps of all the old churches of London there is scarcely <num value="1">one</num> so interesting as <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.191.1">St. Andrew Undershaft,   Leadenhall Street</LEMMA>, nearly opposite the site of the old East India House, the very name itself suggesting some curious and almost forgotten tradition. Stow is peculiarly interesting about this church, which he says derived its singular name from <QUOTE>a high or long shaft or Maypole higher than the church steeple</QUOTE> (hence <hi rend=italics>under</hi> shaft), which used, early in the morning of May Day, the great spring festival of merry England, to   be set up   and hung with flowers opposite the south door of St. Andrew's.

<P>The venerable St. Andrew's Maypole was never raised after that fatal <QUOTE>Evil May Day,</QUOTE> in the reign of Henry VIII., which we have mentioned in our chapter on Cheapside. It remained dry-rotting on its friendly hooks in Shaft Alley till the <num value="3">third</num> year of Edward VI., when the Reforming preachers, growing unusually hot and zealous in the sunshine of royal favour, and, as a natural consequence, considerably intolerant, <num value="1">one</num> Sir Stephen, a curate of the neighbouring St. Katherine's Christ Church, Leadenhall Street, preached against the good old Maypole, and called it an <QUOTE>Idol,</QUOTE> advising all men to alter the Popish names of churches and the names of the days of the week, to eat fish any day but Friday and Saturday, and to keep Lent any

 time but between Shrovetide and Easter.   The same eccentric reformer used to preach out of a high elm-tree in his churchyard, and sing high mass in English from a tomb, far from the altar. The sermon denouncing the Maypole was preached at Paul's Cross, when Stow himself was present; and that same afternoon the good old historian says he saw the Shaft Alley people, <QUOTE>after they had dined, to make themselves strong, gathered more help, and with great labour, raising the shaft from the hooks whereon it had rested <num value="2">two</num>-and-<num value="30">thirty</num> years, they sawed it in pieces, every man taking for his share so much as had lain over his door and stall, the length of his house.</QUOTE> Thus was the <QUOTE>idol</QUOTE> mangled and burned. Not long after there was a <pb id="P.193" n="193"> Romish riot in Essex, and the bailiff of Romford was hung just by the well at Aldgate, on the pavement in front of Stow's own house. While on the ladder this poor perplexed bailiff said he did not know why he was to be hung, unless it was for telling Sir Stephen (the enemy of the Maypole) that there was heavy news in the country, and many men were up in Essex. After this man's death Sir Stephen stole out of London, to avoid popular reproach, and was never afterwards heard of by good old Stow. And this is the whole story of St. Andrew's Maypole and the foolish curate of Catherine Cree. 
<P>Many eminent citizens were buried in this church. Among them we may name John Kirby, the great Elizabethan merchant tailor, and Stow himself, Stephen Jennings, Mayor of London, another worthy merchant tailor, who, in <datestruct value="1520--"><year reg="1520">1520</year></datestruct>, rebuilt half the church, but sought a grave in the Grey Friars (Christ's Hospital).

The chancel has also paintings of the heavenly choir, landscapes, and buildings. St. Andrew's boasts much stained glass, particularly a large painted window at the east end, containing whole-length portraits of Edward VI., Elizabeth, James, Charles I., and Charles II. This church was pewed soon after <datestruct value="1520--"><year reg="1520">1520</year></datestruct>. It contains many valuable brasses, tablets, and monuments, as might   be expected in a celebrated City church lucky enough to escape the Great Fire.

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 
<P>This ancient and ill-used parish extends from Norton Folgate to Old Street, and from part of Finsbury to Bethnal Green. Originally a village on the old Roman northern road, called by the Saxons Old Street, it is now a continuation of Bishopsgate Street. 
<P>The old London tradition is that Shoreditch derived its name from Jane Shore, the beautiful mistress of Edward IV., who, worn out with poverty and hunger, died miserably in a ditch in this unsavoury suburb. This legend, however, is entirely erroneous, as we have shown in a previous chapter. It does not seem to have been popular even so late as <datestruct value="1587"><year reg="1587">1587</year></datestruct>. Dr. Percy hit upon quite as erroneous a derivation when he traced the name of. the parish to shore (sewer), a common drain. Shoreditch, or, more correctly, Soerdich, really took its name from the old family of the Soerdiches, Lords of the Manor in the time of Edward III. Sir John de Soerdich of that reign, an eminent warrior, lawyer, statesman, and diplomatist, was, on <num value="1">one</num> memorable occasion, sent to Rome to protest before the Pope against the greedy and tyrannical way in which foreign priests were thrust into English benefices, and it was all Sir John could do to get safe back to the little island. The Soerdich family, Mr. Timbs informs us, held the manor of Ickenham, near Uxbridge, and resided there till our own time. The last of the family, an engineer, died in <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>, in the West Indies. In the reign of Richard II. the manor of Shoreditch was granted to Edmund, Duke of York, and his son, the Earl of Rutland, which accounts for the fact that St. Leonard's Church, Shoreditch, is full of the Manners family. Stow mentions a house in Hackney called Shoreditch Place; and Strype notes the vulgar tradition that Jane Shore once lived there, and was often visited by her royal lover. This was probably the old mansion of Sir John de Soerdich, who rode against the French spears by the side of the Black Prince, and with Manney and Chandos. 
<P>In the reign of Henry VIII., when Shoreditch was still a mere waste of fields, dotted with windmills and probably, like Islington (fields, much frequented by archers, for practising at roving marks), the burly king conferred on an archer of Shoreditch, named Barlow, who had pleased him at some wondrous competition at Windsor, the jocular title of Duke of Shoreditch. Happiest and proudest of all London's archers must Barlow have gloried at all civic processions, when, as captain, he strode <num value="1">first</num> to the Hoxton, Islington, or Newington Butts. The duke's companions adopted such titles as the Marquises of Hoxton, Islington, Pancras, and Shacklewell, and other ludicrous appellations of honour. In Elizabeth's reign the archers of London numbered no fewer than <num value="3">3</num>,ooo, and on <num value="1">one</num> occasion we hear of <num value="1000">one thousand</num> of them, wearing gold chains, going from the Merchant Taylors' Hall to Smithfield, to try their skill, attended by <num value="4000">4,000</num> billmen, besides pages.   In Dryden's time Shoreditch was a disreputable place, frequented by courtesans; and in Lillo's old ballad of <QUOTE>George Barnwell,</QUOTE> the apprentice hero of which <pb id="P.195" n="195"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.195.1">Entrance to London at Shoreditch Church</LEMMA></NOTE>
 thrice robbed his master and murdered his uncle in Ludlow, that wicked siren, Mrs. Millwood, lives at Shoreditch, <QUOTE>next   door unto   the  <Q>Gun.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.195.2">The present St. Leonard's Church, Shoreditch</LEMMA>, occupies the site of   a church at least as old as the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century. The old church, which had <num value="4">four</num> gables and a low square tower, was taken down in <datestruct value="1736--"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct>, and the present ugly church built by the elder Dance, in <datestruct value="1740--"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>, with a steeple to imitate that of St. Mary-le-Bow, Cheapside, and a fine peal of <num value="12">twelve</num> bells. The chancel window, the gift of Thomas Awsten, in <datestruct value="1634--"><year reg="1634">1634</year></datestruct>, and a tablet to the Awstens, are the only relics left of the old church. St. Leonard's is the actor's church of London; for, in the days of Elizabeth and James, the players of distinction from the Curtain, in Holywell Lane, and from <QUOTE>The Theatre,</QUOTE> as well as those from the Blackfriars Theatre and Shakespeare's Globe, were fond of residing in this parish. Perhaps nowhere in all London have rooms echoed oftener with Shakespeare's name than those of Shoreditch. 
<P>The parish register, within a period of <num value="60">sixty</num> years, says Cunningham, records the interment at St. Leonard's of the following celebrated characters: --Will. Somers, Henry VIII.'s jester (d. <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>); Richard Tarlton, the famous clown of Queen Elizabeth's time (d. <datestruct value="1588--"><year reg="1588">1588</year></datestruct>); James Burbage (d. <datestruct value="1596--"><year reg="1596">1596</year></datestruct>) and his more celebrated son, Richard Burbage (d. <datestruct value="1618--"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct>-<num value="19">19</num>); Gabriel Spenser, the player, who fell, in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, in a duel with Ben Jonson; William Sly and Richard Cowley, <num value="2">two</num> original performers in Shakespeare's plays; the Countess of Rutland, the only child of the famous Sir Philip Sydney; Fortunatus Greene, the <hi>un</hi>fortunate offspring of Robert Greene, the poet and player (d. <datestruct value="1593--"><year reg="1593">1593</year></datestruct>). Another original performer in Shakespeare's plays, who lived in Holywell Street, in this parish, was Nicholas Wilkinson, <hi rend=italics>alias</hi> Tooley, whose name is recorded in gilt letters on the north side of the altar, as a yearly benefactor of <measure value="6l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="6">6</num></measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure>, which sum is still distributed in bread every year to the poor inhabitants of the parish, to whom it was bequeathed. 
<P>In the burial register, <datestruct VALUE="1588-01-22"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=22>22nd</day>, <year reg=1588>1588</year></datestruct>, is the following entry: <QUOTE>Aged   <num value="207">207</num> years.   Holywell Street. Thomas Cam.</QUOTE> The <num value="2">2</num> should probably be <num value="1">1</num>. A correspondent of the <title>Penny Magazine,</title>
 writing in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, notices this entry as the most remarkable record of longevity in existence, and adds: <QUOTE>It thus appears that Cam was born in the year <datestruct value="1381"><year reg="1381">1381</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="4">fourth</num> of Richard II., living through the reign of that monarch, and through those of the whole of the following sovereignsviz., Henry IV., Henry V., Henry VI., Edward IV., Edward V., Richard III., Henry VII., Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary, and to the thirtieth of Elizabeth. Such an extreme duration of life is, how. ever, contrary to all recorded experience; and unless the fact can be supported by other evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the entry in the register is inaccurate.</QUOTE> 
<P>At St. Leonard's, every Whit Tuesday, is preached a sermon on the <QUOTE>Wonderful Works of God in the Creation,</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>On the Certainty of the Resurrection of the Dead, proved by certain changes of the Animal and Vegetable Parts of the Creation.</QUOTE> The money, <measure value="25l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="25">25</num></measure> in all, left for this purpose to the preacher was bequeathed, in <datestruct value="1728--"><year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct>, by Mr. Thomas Fairchild, a gardener, whose gardens (Selby's Gardens) then extended from the west end of Ivy Lane to the New North Road. The sum originally bequeathed was afterwards increased by sundry contributions. It used to be the custom for the President and Fellows of the Royal Society to attend these sermons. 
<P>Holywell Lane (west side of Shoreditch) was so called, says Stow, from a sweet, wholesome, and clear well, spoiled, in that writer's time, by the manure-heaps of the nursery gardens. Here formerly, till the dissolution, stood a Benedictine nunnery of St. John the Baptist, founded by some forgotten Bishop of London; and in this street lived and died Richard Burbage, the tragedian, and friend and companion of Shakespeare. Near St. Leonard's Church stood <num value="2">two</num> of the earliest London theatres--the <QUOTE>Curtain</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>The Theatre.</QUOTE> The site of the <num value="1">first</num> of these is still marked by Curtain Road. 
<P> <QUOTE>The Theatre,</QUOTE> on the site of Holywell Priory, was remarkable as being, according to Malone, the <num value="1">first</num> theatre erected in London. It is noticed in a sermon preached at Paul's Cross, in <datestruct value="1578--"><year reg="1578">1578</year></datestruct>, as the <QUOTE>gorgeous playing-place erected in the Fields.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct> this wooden theatre was taken down, and the timber of it was used for enlarging the Globe. 
<P>The <QUOTE>Curtain</QUOTE> is mentioned as early as <datestruct value="1577"><year reg="1577">1577</year></datestruct> (before Shakespeare came to London), and by Stubbs, in his <title>Anatomie of Abuses,</title> in <datestruct value="1583--"><year reg="1583">1583</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1622--"><year reg="1622">1622</year></datestruct> it was occupied by Prince Charles's actors. Aubrey, in <datestruct value="1678--"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct>, calls it the <QUOTE>Green Curtain,</QUOTE> and terms it <QUOTE>a kind of nursery, or obscure playhouse.</QUOTE> It gradually, like many of the smaller theatres, sank into a sparring-room. Maitland, in his <title>London</title>
 (<datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>), mentions some remains of the <QUOTE>Curtain</QUOTE> as recently standing. It is supposed to have got its name from having been the <num value="1">first</num> house that used the green curtain. <pb id="P.196" n="196">

<P> <QUOTE>This Fen or Moor Field,</QUOTE> says Stow, <QUOTE>stretching from the wall of the City betwixt Bishopsgate and the postern called Cripplesgate, to Finsbury, and to Holywell, continued a waste and unprofitable ground a long time, so that the same was all letten for <measure value="4bmark" type=currency><num value="4">four</num> marks</measure> the year in the reign of Edward II.; but in the year <datestruct value="1415"><year reg="1415">1415</year></datestruct>, the <num value="3">3rd</num> of Henry V., Thomas Falconer, Mayor, caused the wall of the City to be broken toward the said moor, and built <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.196.1">the postern called Moorgate</LEMMA>, for the ease of the citizens to walk that way upon causeys towards Iseldon and Hoxton.</QUOTE> 
<P>Fitzstephen the monk, who wrote a curious account of London in the reign of Henry II., describes Moorfields as the general place of amusement for London youth. Especially, he says, was the Fen frequented for sliding in winter-time, when it was frozen. He then mentions a primitive substitute for skates. <QUOTE>Others there are,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>still more expert in these amusements; they place certain bones--the leg-bones of animals--under the soles of their feet, by tying them round their ankles, and then taking a pole shod with iron into their hands, they push themselves forward by striking it against the ice, and are carried on with a velocity equal to the flight of a bird, or a bolt discharged from a cross-bow.</QUOTE> The piece of water on which the citizens of London performed their pastimes is spoken of by Fitzstephen as <QUOTE>the great Fen or Moor which watereth the walls of the City on the north side.</QUOTE> 
<P>The barren region of Moorfields and Finsbury was <num value="1">first</num> drained (no doubt to the great indignation of the London apprentices) in <datestruct value="1527--"><year reg="1527">1527</year></datestruct>, laid out in pleasant walks in the reign of James I., and <num value="1">first</num> built on after the Great Fire, when all the City was turned topsy-turvy.

<P>It is described by Peter Cunningham, in a few lines that conceal much research, as a place for cudgel-players and train-band musters, for its madhouse (<num value="1">one</num> of the lions of London), and for its wrestlers, pedestrians, bookstall-keepers, and balladsellers.

<title>Aleph</title> (i.e., Mr. William   Harvey), <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>it was a large open quadrangular space, shut in by the Pavement to the west, the hospital and its outbuildings to the south, and lines of shops without fronts, occupied chiefly by dealers in old furniture, to the east and north. Most of these shops were covered in by screens of canvas or rough boards, so as to form an apology for a piazza; and, if you were bold enough, in wet weather you might take refuge under them, but it was at the imminent risk of your purse or your handkerchief.   As Field Lane was the favourite market for wearing apparel, at a low charge, so these stores afforded an endless choice of decayed upholstery to poorer purchasers: a broken-down <num value="4">four</num>-poster or a rickety tent bedstead might be secured at almost any price,  <Q>No reasonable offer was refused.</Q>  It was interesting to inspect the articles exposed for sale: here a cracked mirror in a dingy frame, a set of hair-seated chairs, the horse-hair-protruding; a tall, stiff, upright easy chair, without a bottom; a cupboard with <num value="1">one</num> shelf left of <num value="3">three</num>, and with half a door; here a black oak chest, groaning to be scraped, so thick with ancient dust   that it might have been the den of some unclean animal in Noah's ark; a washhandstand, with a broken basin; a hall clock-case, with a pendulum, but no dial; and other hopelessly invalided household necessaries, too numerous to mention.   These miscellaneous treasures were guarded by swarthy men and women of Israel, who paraded in front of their narrow dominions all the working day; and if you did but pause for an instant, you must expect to be dragged into some hideous Babel of frowsy chattels, and made a purchaser in spite of yourself.   Escaping from   this uncomfortable mart to the hospital footway, a strange sense of utter desertion came over you; long, gloomy lines of cells, strongly barred, and obscured with the accumulated dust, silent as the grave, unless fancy brought sounds of woe to your ears, rose before you; and there, on each side of the principal entrance, were <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.200.3">the wonderful effigies of raving and moping madness</LEMMA>, chiselled by the elder Cibber.

In <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct> were added reading-rooms and a library for the patients, with bagatelle and backgammon boards, &amp;c.

<P>From Moorfields we have not far to go to Finsbury.   It was in Finsbury Fields, on his return after his exploits in Scotland, that the great- Protector, the Duke of Somerset, was met and congratulated by the Lord Mayor, aldermen, and citizens of London. According to the chronicler, Holinshed, 
<title>The mayor and aldermen, with certain of the commons, in their liveries and their hoods, hearing of his approach to the City, the <datestruct value="10-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct> (<datestruct value="1548--"><year reg="1548">1548</year></datestruct>), met him in Finsbury Fields, where he took each of them by the hand, and thanked them for their good wills.

William Eccles, formerly surgeon of the Devonshire Square Hospital, and Royal Free Hospital, a notable surgeon <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> years since, had his <num value="1">first</num> house in Union Court, Broad Street. His successor (Edward Chance) lived afterwards in the same house; but was about the only surgeon residing in a street which once housed not less than a score of surgeons and physicians. Broad Street and Union Court are now made up of chambers tenanted by stock-brokers and other City agents. The last pre-eminently great physician to practise in the City was Henry Jeaffreson, M.D. (Senior Physician of St. Bartholomew's), who died some years since in Finsbury Square, where he had long made a larger income than any other doctor of his day. Several eminent doctors still live in Finsbury Square and Finsbury Pavement. St. Helen's Place (Bishopsgate) also still houses a few well-to-do doctors. Charterhouse Square was another great place for East-end doctors. 
<P>But the migrations of the eminent doctors is not so much due to mere fashion, as to the centralisation and   development of commerce, which have raised the rentals of the residential parts of the quarter so prodigiously, that only very wealthy folk could afford to house themselves there. Such a house as Mr. Eccles had in Broad Street at some <measure value="210l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="210">210</num></measure> a year rent and taxes, is now-a-days let as offices and business chambers for <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> a year. Hence, the commercial families have moved westward from   economy, as well as from disinclination to live in a socially deserted district. The doctors now swarm in Cavendish Square, Harley Street, Wimpole Street, Henrietta Street, Queen Anne Street, Brook Street, Savile Row, and Spring Gardens; and in these days of circular railways and fast cabs, they are as accessible to their unfashionable visitors in such quarters as the old Finsbury doctors were to their outlying patients. 
<P>When the doctors and surgeons thus swarmed in the Finsbury district, the City and its adjacent districts were largely inhabited by wealthy families, that have now also migrated westward, as their doctors naturally have. 
<P>That Campo Santo of the Dissenters, the Bunhill Fields burial-ground (no longer used for interments), is on the west side of the Artillery Ground, and close to Finsbury Square. 
<P>It is generally supposed that the Bunhill Fields Cemetery was the site of the Great Plague pit, so powerfully described   (from   hearsay) by Defoe. Peter Cunningham, usually so exact, has said so, and every writer since has followed in his wake. That the conjecture is entirely erroneous is admirably shown in the following accurate account by Mr. J. C. Jeaffreson, who has devoted much time to the study of the question :--The burial-ground in Bunhill Fields, said our authority in <datestruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>, preserves the ashes of Cromwell's favourite minister, Dr. Goodwin, John Owen, the Puritan ViceChan- cellor of Oxford, General Fleetwood, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.202.2">John Bunyan</LEMMA>, Daniel Defoe, John Horne Tooke, Isaac Watts, Blake, Stothard, Susannah Wesley (the mother of John Wesley), and many other eminent persons. The <QUOTE>great pit in Finsbury,</QUOTE> mentioned by Defoe in his <title>Journal of the Plague in <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>,</title> occupied ground that abuts on the upper end of Goswell Street; whereas Bunhill Fields Cemetery lies within a step of the Artillery Ground, and a stone's throw of Finsbury Square.   The precise locality of Defoe's <QUOTE>Pit.</QUOTE> can be pointed out by any person familiar with the novelist's <title>Journal</title>
 and the map of London.   In the passage of Defoe which describes how John Hayward, the driver of a dead-cart, was on the point of consigning to the gloomy pit a wretched street-musician, who, whilst in a sound sleep, or perhaps stupefied with drink, had been thrown upon a load of corpses, the writer of the <title>Journal,</title> says, <QUOTE>Accordingly when John Hayward, with his bell and the cart, came along, finding <num value="2">two</num> dead bodies lie upon the stall, they took them up with the instrument they used and threw them into the cart, and all this while the piper slept soundly.   From thence they passed along and took in other dead bodies, till, as honest John Hayward told me, they almost buried him alive in the cart. Yet all this while he slept soundly. At length the cart came to the place where the bodies were to be thrown into the ground; which, as I do remember, was at Mountmill; and as the cart usually stopped some time before they were ready to shoot out the melancholy load they had in it--as soon as the cart stopped the fellow awaked, and struggled a little to get his head out from among the dead bodies; when, raising himself up in the cart, he called out,  <Q>Hey! where am I?</Q> </QUOTE> Of the locality called <hi rend=italics>Mountmill,</hi>
 the topographer and historian, William Maitland, writing in <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>, observes, in his <title>London,</title> <QUOTE>At Mountmill, near the upper end of Goswell Street, was situate <num value="1">one</num> of the forts which were erected by order of Parliament, for the security of the City of London in the year <datestruct value="1643"><year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct>.   But the same being rendered useless at the end of the Civil War, a windmill was erected thereon; from   which it received its present name.</QUOTE> The popular impression that Defoe's <QUOTE>great pit in Finsbury</QUOTE> was on the site of the present Bunhill Fields Cemetery is no matter for surprise, when it is known that the <pb id="P.203" n="203"> ground   of the Dissenters' graveyard was actually set apart and consecrated, in <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, for the reception of victims of the plague. That the place was not used for the especial purpose for which it was consecrated, we have Maitland's authority. 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>Of the ground thus set apart by the Corporation of London for a graveyard the City merely owned a lease.   Lying in the centre of a large tract, which   the   City had   held   for <num value="350">350</num> years under a succession of leases, granted by successive prebendaries of Finsbury, the civic authorities had a limited right over the spot.     The fee-simple of the ground was part of the estate attached to the prebend of Finsbury, <num value="1">one</num> of the prebends of St. Paul's Cathedral; and though prebendaries of Finsbury have repeatedly renewed old leases and granted new leases of the land, the freehold of the estate has never passed out of the hands of the Church.   The last lease of the Finsbury estate, made by the Church to the City, was executed in <datestruct value="1769--"><year reg="1769">1769</year></datestruct>, and is a good instance of the nice little arrangements that were formerly made with Church property. Under the authority of a private Act of, Parliament, the then Prebendary Wilson gave a lease of the Finsbury estate to the civic Corporation for <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> years, the said lease being renewable at the expiration of <num value="73">seventy-three</num> years, for <num value="14">fourteen</num> years; whereby the term still to expire would become <num value="40">forty</num> years, and afterwards renewable every <num value="14">fourteen</num> years, in like manner for ever. Hence, under this grant, the City, by duly renewing the lease, could hold for ever ground which is now covered by some of the most valuable residential property in London.<NOTE>This appears to be an error on the part of the writer we are quoting. Mr. Timbs, in his <title>Curiosities of London</title>, <datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>, p. <num value="76">76</num>, quoting from a communication to the <title>City Press</title>, remarks :--<QUOTE>It is said the Act of Parliament authorised the renewal of the lease in perpetuity. <gap>
 This is not the fact. The mistake has arisen from the marginal note saying the lease is renewable; but there is nothing in the Act to warrant the note, and no <num value="1">one</num> at this distance of time can explain how the error has arisen.</QUOTE></NOTE>   By this same private Act, <QUOTE>the writer goes on to say,</QUOTE> the City was empowered to keep <num value="3">three</num>-sixths of the net rents, profits, and annual proceeds arising from the estate during the lease.- <num value="2">Two</num>-sixths of the same revenue were reserved to Prebendary Wilson and his assigns, and the remaining <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="6">sixth</num>   of the income was retained for the prebendary and his successors. This pleasant little arrangement was sanctioned by legislation in the good old times! As holders of the largest single share of the income, the civic authorities took the entire management of the estate, which has, certainly, prospered in their hands. But though the rent-roll has increased   prodigiously under civic management, the rulers of the Cityso far as <num value="1">one</num> portion of the estate, <hi rend=italics>i.e</hi>., Bunhill Fields Cemetery, is concerned-cannot be said to have acted discreetly, and in <num value="1">one</num> matter affecting the entire property they have been guilty of astounding remissness.   Having only a leasehold tenure of the graveyard, they systematically sold the graves in perpetuity, accepting for them money which the buyers of graves would never have thought of paying for ground that might be built upon, or turned into a cattle-market, at the end of a <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> years' lease. Having originally the right to renew the lease on the expiry of seventythree years, the tenants omitted to renew; and, in consequence, through this omission, their interest in the estate would terminate in <datestruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct>. 
<P>It should be observed, that in <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct> the Corporation bought the interest in the estate secured to the Wilson family; consequently, since the date of that purchase, the City has received <num value="5">five</num>-sixths of the annual net income derived from the property. In <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>-in which year, by the terms of the agreement, the Corporation could have renewed the lease--the leaseholders negotiated for the purchase of the freehold of the estate, and the Bishop of London introduced a bill into the Upper House for legalising the sale.   Having passed the Lords, this Bill encountered defeat in the Commons, where it was rejected as a money bill that ought to have originated in the Lower Chamber.   Occupied with this Parliamentary contest, the civic authorities allowed the time to pass without exercising their right to renew the lease; and, in consequence of this remissness, their interests, in <datestruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct>, devolved on the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, in whom the estate of the prebendary of Finsbury vested in <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>. On the termination. of. the civic interest the Commissioners derived from the property about <measure value="60000l." type=currency><num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> pounds</measure> per annum. 
<P>Not only has the City lost its hold over this magnificent rental, but it finds itself in an awkward discussion with the buyers of graves in Bunhill Fields Cemetery, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the other. Apprehensive that the graveyard may be desecrated on the termination of the lease, the Dissenters have, on <num value="2">two</num> occasions, asked the Commissioners to preserve the ground from profanation.   On each occasion the Commissioners have expressed a readiness to settle terms. For <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> they will make over to trustees the burial-ground--the freehold of which is computed as worth <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure>--on condition that, should it be converted to secular uses, their present rights revive. Moreover, the Commissioners have expressed their readiness to preserve the sacred character of the ground, provided the civic <pb id="P.204" n="204"> authorities pay into the purse of the Commission the sums which they have received for the feesimple of graves which they had no power to sell. Anyhow, for <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> the custody of the cemetery may be purchased;   and, if no better terms can be made with the Commissioners, it seems clear that the City is morally bound to supply this sum, for the fulfilment of its engagements to the purchasers of graves. 
<P>There are good reasons to believe that the Commissioners   will not stand   out for the last farthing of the sum just mentioned.   In previous arrangements concerning burial-grounds---the graveyard, for instance, which contains John Wesley's bones--they acted   in   a conciliatory   and   fair manner; and in the present case special considerations counsel them to   take   a moderate course.   In the <num value="1">first</num> place, the ground was actually consecrated; and an Ecclesiastical Commission could not, without indecency, authorise the disturbance of a consecrated burial-ground.   Moreover, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners are morally bound by the action of the City. Throughout the stewardship of the municipal authorities the Church has received a portion of the proceeds of the 
<FIGURE id="Fig.204" n="2000.07.0077"><HEAD>Bunhill Fields Burial-Ground.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 Finsbury   estate.   The prebendaries, who have received the <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="6">sixth</num> of the revenue reserved to the prebend, by taking a <num value="6">sixth</num> of the money derived from   the sale of graves, may be said to have given ecclesiastical sanction to the defective arrangement; and however irregular the arrangement and the sanction may be, it would not be wise in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to disregard them. The relations of the City and the Commission in this matter involve some delicate questions. However, as a body that has greatly benefited   by the entire transaction, and as a society bound to fulfil its contracts with private persons, the Corporation should effect a settlement of the dispute, even at the sacrifice of <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>. 
<P>An account of the negotiations for securing Bunhill Fields to the Corporation of London as a place for recreation, and to prevent desecration of the graves of many eminent Englishmen, was eventually presented to the Common Council. The report stated that the Ecclesiastical Commissioners appear to have proposed to accept, for the preservation of the ground, <num value="5">five</num>-sixths of the purchasemoney paid for vaults, &amp;c., to the Corporation during its current lease. The total receipts were <pb id="P.205" n="205"> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.205" n="2000.07.0078"><HEAD>The Old Post Office, In Lombard Street, About <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="P.206" n="206"> <measure value="24000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="24000">24,000</num></measure>, <hi rend=italics>i.e</hi>., averaging <measure value="247l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="247">247</num></measure> a year.   Half this sum had been applied in connection with the prebend of Finsbury; the other was received by the Corporation.   Failing agreement about the price to be paid by <num value="1">one</num> of these parties to the other, the negotiations stood over.   The latest proposal of the Commissioners was to arbitrate.   The committee declined this, and denied the existence of a legal claim on the Corporation on the part of the Commissioners. The report concluded by stating that no useful result would be obtained by further correspondence, and recommended that the Corporation should repeat the offer to preserve the ground for public use and from   desecration, plant, and watch it, in failure of performing which the land might revert to the Commissioners;   also that they should be authorised to <num value="2">second</num> the efforts of parties who might apply to Parliament or the public for aid to save the graves from speculating builders, and the site for public service.   The report was adopted, and referred back to be carried into effect. It was alleged that the Commissioners valued the ground at about   <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure>, and asked what the Corporation would give for its preservations   If this be true, <QUOTE>said a writer to the <title>Times</title>,</QUOTE> the Commissioners, considering that they represented a party which has already received cash for preserving the graves, were hard   driven.   The   Ecclesiastical Commissioners are probably not so black as they are painted.   Would it not serve all ends if the Government introduced a Bill to the House of Commons to permit, or, better still, to enjoin the Commissioners to relax their hold on the ground, be content with the half share of profits already received, and that the onus of maintaining the ground should be placed upon the recipients of the other moiety, who are anxious to receive it?   It has been stated officially that the Commissioners already receive      <measure value="50000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure> a year on account of the Finsbury prebend.   It appears that in <datestruct value="1655--"><year reg="1655">1655</year></datestruct>, when the estates of that office were sold, the City bought the fee-simple, and for <num value="10">ten</num> years following paid no rent. At the Restoration the property was taken back, rent demanded and paid, to recover which the Corporation farmed part of the land for interments, which began as early as <datestruct value="1665"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, or the Great Plague. At <num value="1">one</num> time the City received as much as <measure value="700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="700">700</num></measure> per annum from this source. In <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct> the   ground was closed, and the registers removed to Somerset House.   This year (<datestruct value="1867"><year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct>) the   whole estate reverts to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, who may feel it their duty so far to violate their natural feelings as to let it for building leases As literary men, if not equally as cosmopolitans, the late and present Chancellors of the Exchequer ought to unite in exonerating the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from this probably painful sense. It would be disgraceful to the Government if the desecration took place.</QUOTE>

The following selections from his autobiography show a curious mixture of piety, vanity, and love of business. 
<P> <QUOTE>I, was born,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>at Wellington, in Somersetshire, <datestruct value="08-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct> (old style), <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct>. My father, George Lackington, was a journeyman shoemaker. He displeased his own father by marrying a woman without a shilling, of a mean family, in my grandmother Trott's poor cottage; and that good woman took me to church, unknown to my father, who was (nominally) a Quaker, that being the religion of his ancestors.   My father ultimately became a drunkard, but to our mother we are indebted for everything. Never did I hear of a woman who worked and lived so hard as she did to support <num value="11">eleven</num> children. For many years she worked <num value="19">nineteen</num> and <num value="20">twenty</num> hours out of every <num value="24">twenty-four</num>.   Whenever she was asked to drink half a pint of ale, she always asked leave to take it home to her husband, who was always so mean and selfish as to drink it. Out of love to us she abstained from all drink save water. Her food was chiefly broth (little more than water and oatmeal), turnips, potatoes, cabbages, carrots. Her children fared Somewhat better, but not much.   I was put for <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> years to a dame school, kept by an old woman,   where I was thought, from being able to repeat several chapters of the New Testament, to be a prodigy of science; but my mother soon became so poor that she could not afford twopence a week for my schooling. Indeed, I was forced to nurse my brothers and sisters, and soon forgot what little I knew. Then I became the <pb id="P.207" n="207"> captain of all the mischievous boys in the place; so that if an old woman's lanthorn were kicked out of her hand, or drawn up a sign-post, or if anything were fastened to her tail, or if her door were nailed up, I was sure to be accused of the crime whether I were guilty or not. For spiriting the town lads to mock our butcher, who was given to yawning, I had nearly been killed like <num value="1">one</num> of his calves, for he flung his cleaver at me. At <num value="10">ten</num> years old I cried apple pies in the street. I had noticed a famous pieman, and thought I could do it better myself. My mode of crying pies soon made me a street favourite, and the old pie merchant left off trade. You see, friend, I soon began to make a noise in the world. But <num value="1">one</num> day I threw my master's child out of a wheelbarrow, so I went home again, and was set by my father to learn his trade, continuing with him for several years. My fame as a pieman led to my selling almanacks on the market days at Christmas. This was to my mind, and I sorely vexed the vendors of  <Q>Moore,</Q>   <Q>Wing,</Q>  and  <Q>Poor Robin.</Q>  My next move was to be bound apprentice for <num value="7">seven</num> years to Mr. George and Mrs. Mary Bowdon-yes, to both wife and husband, and an honest, worthy couple they were. They were Anabaptists, and I attended their place of worship; though, for a long while, I had no idea that I had any concern in what the minister preached about. Master had <num value="2">two</num> sons who had been at school, but all they read was the Bible. Master's whole library consisted of a school-size Bible, Watt's Hymns, Foote on Baptism, Culpepper's  <Q>Herbal,</Q>   <Q>The History of the Gentle Craft,</Q>   <Q>Receipts in Physic,</Q>  and a  <Q>Ready Reckoner.</Q>  
<P>I was soon able to read easy parts of the Bible and Wesley's Hymns; every leisure minute was so employed. I worked from <num value="6">six</num> to <num value="10">ten</num>, yet managed to read <num value="6">six</num> chapters every day, as well as some sermons. My eyes were good, and I could often read by moonlight. I was far gone in enthusiasm, and on a Sunday, being locked in my room to prevent my going to meeting, I opened the Bible and read,  <Q>He has given His angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands shall they bear thee up, lest at any time thou shouldest dash thy foot against a stone.</Q>  Wherefore I threw myself out of window. I was carried back to bed, where it was a month before I recovered the use of my limbs. I was ignorant enough to think that the Lord had not used me very well, and resolved not to put so much trust in Him for the future. 
<P>For many years I have expended <num value="2">two</num>-thirds of my profits, but never more.   Once I beckoned across the way for a pot of porter; then a dinner, roast veal; then with an addition of ham; and then a wind--up of pudding. Once a glass of brandyand- water was a luxury; raisin wine followed; then good red port; nor was sherry long behind. It was not long before the country was a necessity once a year; lodgings <num value="1">first</num>, then my own mansion; and at length the inconveniences of a stage coach were remedied by a chariot. 
<P>My new wife's attachment to books was fortunate. She delighted to be in the shop, and could readily get any article that was asked for.   Such constant attention procured me many customers. I wanted a larger stock, but had no capital. Mr. John Dennis, an oilman, of Cannon Street, offered to be my partner, and to advance money in proportion to the stock. We soon laid out the cash in <num value="2">second</num>-hand books, which at once doubled them. In <datestruct value="1779--"><year reg="1779">1779</year></datestruct> we published a catalogue of <num value="12000">12,000</num> volumes. We took <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> the <num value="1">first</num> week.</QUOTE>
 
<P>This partnership was dissolved in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>. In that year Lackington determined to give no credit, and though he admits he had some difficulties in carrying out the plan, he says it fully answered. His business steadily increased; and the catalogue for <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct> contained <num value="30000">30,000</num> volumes. He declares he sold at a very small profit, and, ultimately, was able to give a higher price when purchasing than other booksellers. At the trade sales there were often <num value="80000">80,000</num> volumes sold in an afternoon. It was common to destroy <num value="1">one</num>-half or <num value="3">three</num>-fourths of them in order to keep up the prices. This Lackington did for some time, but soon resolved not to destroy any good books, but to sell them off at a half or a quarter of the publication prices. 
<P> <QUOTE>My purchases,</QUOTE> says he, <QUOTE>were now very large. I have purchased, <num value="6000">6,000</num> copies of <num value="1">one</num> book, and at <num value="1">one</num> time have had <num value="10000">10,000</num> copies of Watts's Hymns and as many of his Psalms in my possession.

In the winter time, when the lectures are delivered by leading men of science, the theatre is as full as can well be imagined, and is by no means a quiet resting-place; but the reading-room is a treat, and it is pleasant to get away from the City bustle, and take shelter there. Another recommendation of the place is that under the library there is a wellsupplied newspaper room. (Timbs.) 
<P> <QUOTE>The Pavement-so called, no doubt,</QUOTE> says Aleph, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>as the only firm pathway in the neighbourhood--was formerly edged with some <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num> brick houses, with very unpretentious shops attached --bakers, butchers, ale and spirit stores, and the like, with a chapel in the centre; the whole giving no promise of the gay and tempting shop-windows, blazing with gas, so soon to be substituted. Yet most of the buildings are unaltered, even now; only the facia has been  <Q>improved and beautified.</Q>  
<P>How, you will ask, was the centre of old Moorfields employed, in its chrysalis state? Variously. In the days of Wesley and Whitefield it was the favourite haunt of open-air preachers. Both those remarkable men chose the spot for their London lectures; and they often gathered audiences of a fabulous number--the prints of the period say, of <num value="20000">20,000</num>, <num value="30000">30,000</num>, and even <num value="50000">50,000</num>. They had begun to preach in the churches, but it was alleged the vast crowds made that practice dangerous, and they extemporised pulpits under the blue vault of heaven. The Tabernacle, not far distant, was the result of this movement. <gap>
 
<P>In <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, and long after, carpet-beating was the chief use of the dry or sloppy area (according to the season). Poles with ropes stretched across were placed at intervals, and sturdy arms brandishing stout sticks were incessantly assaulting Turkey, Kidderminster, and Brussels floor-covers, and beating out such clouds of dust that as you passed it was expedient to hold your cambric or bandanna over your mouth and nostrils. Then you had, in fairtime, those humble incentives to gambling which for a penny offer the chance of winning a tin box or a wooden apple. <num value="5">Five</num> uprights are stuck in deep holes; you stand a few yards off, supplied with short sticks, and if you can knock away box or apple without its lapsing into the hole, it becomes your property, and the gain may be about twopence. Those days are gone; the open space is filled in with a strange conglomeration of buildings, public and private- the London Institution, a Catholic cathedral, a Scotch church, a seceding ditto, the Ophthalmic Hospital, Finsbury Circus. and dwellings of all sizes, accommodating a mixed population, varying in position from extreme poverty to wealth.</QUOTE>

<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.209.1">Aldersgate</LEMMA> was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="4">four</num> original gates of London, and formed the extreme corner to the north. Some say it was named after Aldrich, a Saxon, who built it; others, says Stow, attribute it to the alder trees which grew around it. There is no mention of it previous to the Conquest. Becoming dilapidated and dangerous, it was pulled down by order of the Lord Mayor and aldermen; but rebuilt in <datestruct value="1618--"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct>, the expense (more than <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure>) being defrayed out of a legacy, left for the purpose by <num value="1">one</num> William Parker, a merchant tailor.   It was damaged in the Great Fire, but soon after repaired and beautified.

 posterns for pedestrians. Over the arch was a figure in high relief of James I., but the building itself was heavy and inelegant. The imperial arms surmounted the figure, for through this gate the Stuart <num value="1">first</num> entered London when he came to take possession of the Crown. On the eastern side was an effigy of the prophet Jeremiah, and these lines from his prophecies:-- <QUOTE>Then shall enter into the gates of this city kings and princes, sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall remain for ever.</QUOTE> In the western niche was an effigy of Samuel, with this inscription:-- <QUOTE>And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that you said unto me, and have made a king over you.</QUOTE> On the south was a bas-relief of James in his royal robes. 
<P>The City Crier had rooms over the gate, but in Elizabeth's reign they were occupied by John Day, who printed the folio Bible dedicated to Edward VI. in <datestruct value="1549--"><year reg="1549">1549</year></datestruct>. He also printed the works of Roger Ascham, Latimer's Sermons, and Foxe's <title>Actes and Monuments.</title> There is a work of his now much sought after by book-collectors on account of the frontispiece, which represents Day with a whip entering the room of his workmen, who are sleeping, the sun shining upon them. He rouses them   with these words: <QUOTE>Arise, for it is day.</QUOTE> This gate was sold in <datestruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>, and taken down immediately afterwards. The <QUOTE>Castle and Falcon</QUOTE> inn was built near its site. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.209.4">The General Post Office</LEMMA> forms a noble preface to an important street. From <num value="2">two</num> years before the death of Charles II. there has been a Penny Post (<num value="1">one</num> of the greatest blessings of civilisation) established   in London.   In   Cromwell's time, the revenues of the Post Office were farmed to a Mr. John Manley for <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> a year, and it was calculated that latterly Manley made <measure value="14000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="14000">14,000</num></measure> annually by his bargain.   Bishop, his successor, had to pay <measure value="21500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="21500">21,500</num></measure> a year for the office (the monopoly of letting post horses being included). In <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> year of this disgraceful reign, the entire revenue of the Post Office was granted to the Duke of York. About this time Robert Murray, an upholsterer, suggested the idea of a post from <num value="1">one</num> part of London to another, the City having grown too large for messengers. Murray's Post was afterwards assigned to Mr. William Dockwra (or Docwra). By the early regulations, all letters not exceeding a pound in weight were to be charged <num value="1">one</num> penny for the City and suburbs, and twopence for any distance within a <num value="10">ten</num> mile radius. <num value="6">Six</num> large offices were opened in different parts of London, and receiving-houses were established in all the principal streets.   The deliveries in the chief streets near the Exchange were as many as <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> times a day, and in the outskirts there were <num value="4">four</num> daily deliveries. 
<P>The moment the Penny Post became a success, the courtiers were all nibbling, and the Duke of York complained that his monopoly was infringed. Titus Oates cried out that the Penny Post was a Jesuit scheme, and useful for transmitting Popish treason. The City porters, too, says Mr. Lewin, in his excellent book, <QUOTE>Her Majesty's Mails,</QUOTE> pulled down the placards, <QUOTE>Penny Post Letters taken in here,</QUOTE> from the doors of the receiving--houses. The Court of King's Bench, on a trial, decided, of course unjustly, that the new office must be absorbed by the Government. From this time, the London District Post existed as a separate establishment from the General Post, and so continued till <datestruct value="1854"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>. Shortly after this verdict Mr. Dockwra was appointed, under the Duke of York, controller of the District Post. On the accession of the Duke of York the revenues of the Post Office reverted to the Crown. <num value="10">Ten</num> years after the removal of unfortunate Dockwra from the <QUOTE>Penny Post,</QUOTE> a Mr. Povey attempted, in vain, to rival the Government by establishing a <QUOTE>Halfpenny Post.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct> Pope's friend, Ralph Allen- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Let humble Allen, with an awkward shame,

 established an improved system of <QUOTE>cross posts,</QUOTE> at a rental of <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure> a year. By this contract Allen is supposed to have made nearly half a million sterling. On the death of this worthy and successful speculator, the cross posts passed under the control of the Postmasters-General. In <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, when this department was amalgamated, the proceeds, says Mr. Lewin, had reached the enormous yearly sum of <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure>. 
<P>The careless post-boy on a slow horse was still the agent employed to carry letters, often requiring to be conveyed with the utmost care and speed. <num value="15">Fifteen</num> years after the death of Allen, a greater reformer arose in the person of Mr. John Palmer, a brewer and theatrical manager at Bath. In <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct>, after some successful experiments with coaches and swifter horses, he was at once appointed controllergeneral of the Post Office, at   <num value="1500">1,500</num> a year, with <num value="2">two</num> and a half per cent. commission upon any excess of net revenue over <measure value="240000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="240000">240,000</num></measure>, the Post Office's annual revenue for the year of his appointment.   The conservative opposition to Palmer's improvements was incessant and untiring, and in <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct> he was compelled to surrender his <pb id="P.210" n="210"> appointment for a pension of <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure> a year.   After a <num value="20">twenty</num> years' struggle against this unfair removal, Mr. Palmer's son, in <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, obtained a Parliamentary grant of   <measure value="50000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure>.   The <num value="1">first</num> year of the introduction of Mr. Palmer's plans the net revenue of the Post Office was about <measure value="250000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="250000">250,000</num></measure>; <num value="30">thirty</num> years afterwards, the proceeds had increased sixfold- to no less a sum, indeed, than a million and a half sterling. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct> there were <num value="54">fifty four</num>-horse mails, and <num value="49">forty-nine</num> <num value="2">two</num>-horse mails in England, says Mr. Lewin, <num value="30">thirty</num> in Ireland, and <num value="10">ten</num> in Scotland. The last year of mail coaches, <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> mails left London every night punctually at <measure value="8d." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num> p.</measure>m., travelling in the aggregate about <num value="5500">5,500</num> miles before they reached their several destinations. 
<P>The original Post Office, of which a view is given on page <num value="205">205</num>, stood in Lombard Street,<NOTE>See Vol, I., p. <num value="525">525</num>.</NOTE>
 and <num value="1">one</num> of the most interesting sights of the Post Office in old time was the gay procession of mail coaches thither on the   King's   birthday. Hone, in <datestruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>, tells us that George IV.   changed the annual celebration of his birthday to St. George's Day, <datestruct value="04-23"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=23>23rd</day></datestruct>. <QUOTE>According to annual custom,</QUOTE> says he, <QUOTE>the mail coaches went in procession from   Millbank to Lombard Street.

<FIGURE id="Fig.210" n="2000.07.0079"><HEAD>Aldersgate.    (From A Print Of <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 and postboys on horseback, arrayed in their new scarlet coats and jackets, proceed from Lombard Street to Millbank, and there dine. At this place the coaches are fresh painted, then the procession, being arranged, begins to move, about <num value="5">five</num> o'clock in the afternoon, headed by the General Post men on horseback. The mails follow them, filled with the wives and children, friends and relations, of coachmen and guards, while the post-boys, sounding their bugles and cracking their whips, bring up the rear. From the commencement of the procession the bells of the different churches ring out merrily, and continue their rejoicing peals till it arrives at the General Post Office, in Lombard Street, from   whence they sparkle abroad to all parts of the kingdom. Great crowds assemble to witness the cavalcade as it passes through the principal streets of the metropolis. <gap> The clean and cheerful appearance of the coachmen and guards, each with a large bouquet of flowers in his bright scarlet coat, the beauty of the cattle and the general excellence of the equipment, present a most agreeable spectacle to every eye and mind, that can   be gratified by seeing and reflecting on the advantages derived to trade and social intercourse by this magnificent establishment.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Such a splendid display of carriages and <num value="4">four</num> as these mail coaches,</QUOTE> says Von Raumer, in <datestruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>could not be found or got together in all Berlin.

 <pb id="P.212" n="212"> a real pleasure to see them in all the pride and strength which, in an hour or <num value="2">two</num> later, was to send them in every direction, with incredible rapidity, to every corner of England.</QUOTE> 
<P>The Money Order Office dates from <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>. No order originally could be issued for more than <num value="5">five</num> guineas, and the charge for that sum amounted to <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence, or nearly <num value="5">five</num> per cent. It was originally a private speculation of <num value="3">three</num> Post Office officials, and so remained till <datestruct value="1838"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>, when it became a branch of the general institution.   It began with <num value="2">two</num> small rooms at the north end of St. Martin's-le-Grand, and a staff of <num value="3">three</num> clerks. During the year <datestruct value="1863"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct> the number of orders amounted in round numbers to <measure value="7500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="7500000">7,500,000</num></measure>, representing a money value exceeding <measure value="16000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="16000000">16,000,000</num></measure>, the commission on the whole amounting to more than <measure value="144000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="144000">144,000</num></measure>. 
<P>That great reform of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.212.1">Rowland Hill's</LEMMA>, the Penny Postage, was <num value="1">first</num> mooted in <datestruct value="1837--"><year reg="1837">1837</year></datestruct>, and in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct> the uniform rate of fourpence a letter was tried. The penny rate for half an ounce commenced in <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>. Telegraph messages were <num value="1">first</num> used to expedite Post Office business in <datestruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>, the Duke of Argyll being Postmaster-General, the General Post and the London District Letter-carriers were amalgamated, and the red uniform of the General Post abandoned. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct> <num value="4">four</num> houses in Abchurch Lane were taken for the Post service, and additional offices erected; and from time to time other additions were made, until the whole became a cumbrous and inconvenient mass of buildings, ill adapted to the great increase which had taken place in the business of the Post Office. It was at length determined to erect a building expressly for affording the conveniences and facilities required; and in <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct> an Act was passed authorising certain commissioners to select a site.   The situation chosen was at the junction of St. Martin's-le-Grand with Newgate Street, where once stood a monastery which had possessed the privileges of sanctuary. The <num value="1">first</num> stone of   <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.212.2">the new building</LEMMA> was laid in <datestruct VALUE="1824-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>. On the <datestruct VALUE="1829-09-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, it was completed and opened for the transaction of business. It is about <num value="400">400</num> feet long, <num value="130">130</num> wide, and <num value="64">64</num> feet high.   The front is composed of <num value="3">three</num> porticoes of the Ionic order-<num value="1">one</num> of <num value="4">four</num> columns being placed at each end, and <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="8">eight</num> columns forming the centre-and surmounted by a pediment. In the interior is a hall <num value="80">80</num> feet long, by about <num value="60">60</num> wide, divided into a centre and <num value="2">two</num> aisles by <num value="2">two</num> ranges of <num value="6">six</num> Ionic columns, standing upon pedestals of granite. There is a tunnel underneath the hall by which the letters are conveyed, by ingenious mechanical means, between the northern and southern divisions of the building. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>, under the old system, the number of letters which passed   through the post was <num value="76000000">76,000,000</num>.   In <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct> came the uniform   penny, and for that year the number was <num value="162000000">162,000,000</num>, or an increase of <num value="93000000">93,000,000</num>, equal to <num value="123">123</num> per cent. That was the grand start; afterwards the rate of increase subsided from <num value="36">36</num> per cent. in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct> to <num value="16">16</num> per cent. in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>, and the <num value="3">three</num> following years, the increase was respectively <num value="39">39</num>, <num value="37">37</num>, and <num value="30">30</num> per cent. Then succeeded a sudden drop; perhaps the culminating point in the rate of increase had been attained.   The Post Office is, however, a thermometer of commerce. During the depressing year <datestruct value="1848"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct> the number of letters increased no more than <num value="9">9</num> per cent. But in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct> <num value="337500000">337,500,000</num> epistles passed   through the office, being an augmentation of <num value="8500000">8,500,000</num> upon the preceding year, or   <num value="11">11</num> per cent. of progressive increase. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct> it was estimated that upon an average <num value="300">300</num> letters per day passed through the General Post Office totally unfastened, chiefly in consequence of the use of what stationers are pleased to call <QUOTE>adhesive</QUOTE> envelopes. Many were virgin ones, without either seal or direction; and not a few contained money. In Sir Francis Freeling's time the sum of <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure> in bank-notes was found in a <QUOTE>blank.</QUOTE> It was not till after some trouble that the sender was traced, and the cash restored to him. Not long since, an humble postmistress of an obscure Welsh post town, unable to decipher the address on a letter, perceived, on examining it, the folds of several bank-notes protruding from a torn edge of the envelope. She securely re-enclosed it to the secretary of the Post Office in St. Martin's-le-Grand, who found the contents to be <measure value="1500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1500">1,500</num></measure>, and the superscription too much even for the hieroglyphic powers of the <QUOTE>blind clerk.</QUOTE> Eventually the enclosures found their true destination. 
<P>The dead letters of <num value="1">one</num> year alone contained, stowed among other articles, tooth-picks, toothfiles, fishing-flies, an eye-glass, bradawls, portraits, miniatures, a whistle, corkscrews, a silver watch, a pair of spurs, a bridle, a soldier's discharge and sailor's register tickets, samples of hops and corn, a Greek MS., silver spoons, gold thread, dinner, theatre, and pawn tickets, boxes of pills, shirts, nightcaps, razors, all sorts of knitting and lace, <QUOTE>dolls' things,</QUOTE> and a vast variety of other articles, that would puzzle ingenuity to conjecture. 
<P>The letters formerly were ranged, for stamping the date and hour of despatch, in a long row, like a pack of cards thrown across a table, and so <pb id="P.213" n="213">

 fast did the stamper's hand move, that he could mark <num value="6000">6,000</num>   in an   hour.   While defacing the Queen's heads, he counted as he thumped, till he enumerated <num value="50">fifty</num>, when he dodged his stamp on <num value="1">one</num> side to put his black mark on a piece of plain paper.   All these memoranda were afterwards collected by the president, who, reckoning <num value="50">fifty</num> letters to every black mark, got a near approximation to the number that had passed through the office. This work is now performed by machinery. The total number of letters which passed through the Post Office on Valentine's Day, <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>, was <num value="187037">187,037</num>.   To this total are to be added <num value="6000">6,000</num> <QUOTE>bye</QUOTE> letters-or those which passed from village to village within the suburban limits of the District Post without reaching the chief office-and <num value="100000">100,000</num>, destined   for the provinces and places beyond sea, which were transferred to the Inland Department. The grand total for the day, therefore, rose to nearly <num value="300000">300,000</num>.   Thus the sacrifices to the fane of St. Valentine, consisting of hearts, darts, Cupids peeping out of paper roses, Hymen embowered in hot-pressed embossing, swains in very blue coats, and nymphs in very opaque muslin, coarse caricatures and tender verses, caused an augmentation to the revenue on this anniversary equal to about <num value="70000">70,000</num> missives; <num value="123000">123,000</num> being the usual daily average for district and <QUOTE>byes</QUOTE> during the month of February.   This increase, being   peculiar to cross and district posts, does not so much affect the Inland Office, for lovers and sweethearts are generally neighbours. The entire correspondence of the <num value="3">three</num> kingdoms it was calculated in <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct> was augmented on each St. Valentine's Day to the extent of about <num value="400000">400,000</num> letters.

<P>From the report of the Postmaster-General for the year <datestruct value="1872"><year reg="1872">1872</year></datestruct>, we gather the following interesting facts:-- 
<P>The Post Office Savings-Banks continue to show a steady and rapid advance in their business; with a remarkable increase in the number of friendly, provident, and other societies and institutions placing money in them. The number of depositors last year increased in round numbers from upwards of <num value="1300000">1,300,000</num>   to upwards of <num value="1440900">1,440,900</num>; and the whole amount of deposits (including interest) from <measure value="17000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="17000000">17,000,000</num></measure> to upwards of <measure value="20000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000000">20,000,000</num></measure>, giving an average of more than <measure value="13l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="13">13</num></measure> for each depositor. 
<P>Last year the Post Office, on behalf of the Board of Inland Revenue, issued more than <num value="1000000">1,000,000</num> licenses of various kinds, producing a revenue of nearly <measure value="50000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure>, being an increase of about <num value="3">three</num> per cent. on the previous year. Of these licenses more than <measure value="57000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="57000">57,000</num></measure> were for keeping dogs. 
<P>Last year the number of officers was increased by about <num value="2000">2,000</num>, making a total of rather more than <num value="40000">40,000</num>, of whom about <num value="9600">9,600</num>, or nearly <num value="1">one</num>-quarter, are employed exclusively on telegraph work. Upwards of <num value="12000">12,000</num> of the officers are postmasters, about <num value="8600">8,600</num> clerks, &amp;c., and upwards of <num value="19000">19,000</num> letter-carriers, sorters, messengers, &amp;c.   Of the foregoing staff nearly <num value="9000">9,000</num> belong to the London district, and of these more than <num value="3000">3,000</num> are attached to the chief offices, St. Martin's-le-Grand, and over <num value="1500">1,500</num> to the Central Telegraph Office. 
<P>The gross revenue from   postage and money orders last year was, in round numbers, <measure value="5209000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5209000">5,209,000</num></measure> --namely, <num value="5013000">5,013,000</num> from postage, and <measure value="196000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="196000">196,000</num></measure> from money orders. 
<P>The expenditure last year was <measure value="3685000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3685000">3,685,000</num></measure>, as compared with <measure value="3611000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3611000">3,611,000</num></measure> in <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>, showing an increase of <measure value="74000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="74000">74,000</num></measure>. 
<P>The net revenue last year was <measure value="1524000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1524000">1,524,000</num></measure>- namely, <measure value="1505000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1505000">1,505,000</num></measure> from postage, and <measure value="19000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="19000">19,000</num></measure> from money orders; being an increase on the net revenue from postage, in <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>, of <measure value="260500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="260500">260,500</num></measure>, and a decrease on that from money orders of <measure value="9500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="9500">9,500</num></measure>; or a balance of increase amounting to <measure value="251000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="251000">251,000</num></measure>. 
<P>The number of letters which, owing to wrong addresses and other causes, found their way back to the Returned Letter Office, did not greatly differ from the number in <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>, and was about <num value="3600000">3,600,000</num>. About <num value="88000">88,000</num> of the undelivered letters contained property of different kinds. Besides the property thus posted, there were <num value="2700">2,700</num> valuable books, which, owing to careless packing or weak envelopes, escaped from their covers, but were recorded, so as to allow of their being traced if inquired for; and more than <num value="51000">51,000</num> postage stamps were found loose in the different post-offices.

 ber of letters posted last year without any address was <num value="15000">15,000</num>. 
<P>The number of ordinary telegraphic messages last year reached a total of nearly <num value="15000000">15,000,000</num>, showing an increase of nearly <num value="3000000">3,000,000</num>, or about <num value="25">25</num> percent. During a single night, when important Ministerial statements were made in Parliament, upwards of <num value="200000">200,000</num> words, or about <num value="100">100</num> columns of the <title>Times</title> newspaper, were transmitted from the central station in London for publication in the provincial press. The total length of the Postal Telegraph wires at the end of the year was more than <num value="105000">105,000</num> miles, of which about <num value="5000">5,000</num> miles were rented by private persons. In <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct> the total mileage was rather less than <num value="88000">88,000</num>. 
<P>During the last year nearly <num value="270">270</num> additional Money Order Offices (serving also as Savings-Banks) were opened, making the whole number upwards of <num value="4600">4,600</num>.   The number of inland money orders increased from rather more than   <num value="12000000">12,000,000</num> in <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct> to nearly <num value="14000000">14,000,000</num> (amounting to <num value="24000000">24,000,000</num>) in <datestruct value="1872--"><year reg="1872">1872</year></datestruct>, or by nearly <num value="16">16</num> per cent. The number of colonial and foreign money orders last year, counting the issues both in this country and abroad, was about <num value="260000">260,000</num>, being an increase of about <num value="70000">70,000</num>, or nearly <num value="37">37</num> per cent., on the number in <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>. These orders amounted to more than   <num value="1000000">1,000,000</num> (as compared with about <num value="770000">770,000</num> in <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct>), and yielded a profit of nearly <measure value="9000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="9000">9,000</num></measure>, being an increase during the year of nearly <measure value="3500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3500">3,500</num></measure>.

<P>Postage ceased to be charged on the correspondence of Government departments early in the   year <datestruct value="1868"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>.     The amount of Government postage (excluding the Post Office itself) for the last complete year in which it was charged (<datestruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct>), was about <measure value="197000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="197000">197,000</num></measure>. 
<P>In an admirable article in the <num value="1">first</num> volume of

Wills described, in a very animated way, the manner of then closing the evening letter-boxes at <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.214.4">St. Martin's-le-Grand</LEMMA>. <QUOTE>It was a quarter before <num value="6">six</num> o'clock,</QUOTE> they say, <QUOTE>when they crossed the hall, <num value="6">six</num> being the latest hour at which newspapers can be posted without fee. It was then just drizzling newspapers. The great window of that department being thrown open, the <num value="1">first</num> black fringe of a thunder-cloud of newspapers, impending over the Post Office, was discharging itself fitfully--now in large drops, now in little; now in sudden plumps, now stopping altogether.   By degrees it began to rain hard; by fast degrees the storm   came on harder and harder, until it blew, rained, hailed, snowed, newspapers. A fountain of newspapers played in at the window. Waterspouts of newspapers broke from enormous sacks, and engulfed the men inside. A prodigious main of newspapers, at the Newspaper River Head, seemed to be turned on, threatening destruction to the miserable Post Office. The Post Office was so full already, that the window foamed at the mouth with newspapers.   Newspapers flew out like froth, and were tumbled in again by the bystanders.   All the boys in London seemed to have gone mad, and to be besieging the Post Office with newspapers.   Now and then there was a girl; now and then a woman; now and then a weak old man; but as the minute hand of the clock crept near to <num value="6">six</num>, such a torrent of boys and such a torrent of newspapers came tumbling in together pell-mell, head over heels, <num value="1">one</num> above another, that the giddy head looking on chiefly wondered why the boys springing over <num value="1">one</num> another's heads, and flying the garter into the Post Office, with the enthusiasm of the corps of acrobats at M. Franconi's, didn't post themselves nightly along with the newspapers, and get delivered all over the world. Suddenly it struck <num value="6">six</num>. Shut, sesame!</QUOTE> 
<P>On the site of the General Post Office, in the early days, stood a   <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.214.5">collegiate church</LEMMA> and sanctuary, founded by Withu, King of Kent, in <num value="750">750</num>, and only enlarged in <datestruct value="1056--"><year reg="1056">1056</year></datestruct> by Ingebrian, Earl of Essex, and Girard, his brother, and confirmed by a charter of William the Conqueror, in <datestruct value="1068--"><year reg="1068">1068</year></datestruct>.   The proud Norman also gave to the college all the moor land without Cripplegate, and granted them <QUOTE>soc and sac, dot and sheam,</QUOTE> in a chapter confirmed by <num value="2">two</num> cardinals of Pope Alexander. Many of the deans of this college were great people, observes Strype, <num value="1">one</num> being Keeper of the Treasure and Jewels of Edward III., and another Clerk of the Privy Seal. The college was a parish of itself, and

 <pb id="P.215" n="215"> claimed great privileges of sanctuary, prisoners from Newgate to Tower Hill sometimes trying to slip from their guards and get through the south gate of St. Martin's. Thus, in <datestruct value="1442--"><year reg="1442">1442</year></datestruct> (Henry VI.), a soldier, on his way from Newgate to the Guildhall, was dragged by <num value="5">five</num> of his fellows, who rushed out of Pannier Alley, in at the west door of the sanctuary; but that same day the <num value="2">two</num> sheriffs came and took out the <num value="5">five</num> men from the sanctuary, and led them fettered to the Compter, and then chained by the necks to Newgate. The Dean and Chapter of St. Martin's, furious at this, complained to the king, who, after hearing the City, who denied the right of sanctuary to the college, returned the <num value="5">five</num> soldiers to their former retreat. In the reign of Henry VII. the right of sanctuary was again violated, and again disputed at law, and this time the sheriffs were <QUOTE>grievously fined</QUOTE> for their pains. 
<P>In the reign of Edward II. there was before St. Martin's College a <QUOTE>solar,</QUOTE> that is, a large airy room, or chamber, somewhat like the galleries in great houses, being places of entertainment and pleasure. This <QUOTE>solar</QUOTE> was toward the street, and a jetty outward, which was so low that it annoyed the people passing along. 
<P>When   the college of St. Martin's-le-Grand flourished, the curfew was rung here, as at Bow, St. Giles's, Cripplegate, and Allhallow's, Barking, to warn citizens to keep within doors. Strype also mentions' an ordinance of Edward I., at a time when <QUOTE>certain Hectors</QUOTE> infested the streets at night, walking armed, and committing <QUOTE>mischiefs, murders, and   robberies,</QUOTE> commanding none to wander in the streets after <QUOTE>coverfew</QUOTE> has sounded at St. Martin's-le-Grand. 
<P>A crypt was laid open in St. Martin's-le-Grand on clearing for the site of the General Post Office, in <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>. There were then found <num value="2">two</num> ranges of vaults, which had served as cellars to the houses above; <num value="1">one</num> of these being the crypt of St. Martin's (taken down in <datestruct value="1547--"><year reg="1547">1547</year></datestruct>) and afterwards the cellar of a large wine-tavern, the <QUOTE>Queen's Head.</QUOTE> This was in the pointed style of Edward III., and was most probably the work of William of Wykeham. The <num value="2">second</num> or westernmost range, which must have supported the nave, was of earlier date, and was a square vaulted chamber, divided by piers <num value="6">six</num> feet square. Here was found a coin of Constantine, and a stone coffin containing a skeleton; and in digging somewhat lower down, Roman remains were met with in abundance. In St. Martin's-le-Grand also, between Aldersgate and St. Anne's Lane end, was the large tavern of the <QUOTE>Mourning Bush,</QUOTE> whose vaulted cellars, as they remain from the Great Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, disclose the foundation wall of Aldersgate, and are a remarkably fine specimen of early brick archwork.

The ground floor is appropriated to the Postmaster-General and the Accountant-General. On the <num value="1">first</num> floor are accommodated the secretaries and their staff; the <num value="3">third</num> and <num value="4">fourth</num> floors being appropriated to the telegraph department.

All messages are brought to the central sorting-table, and there subdivided: those for the country being sent to the upper or Provincial Gallery by a lift, those for the City being sorted into different batches, and dispatched by the agency of a pneumatic tube to the delivery station nearest to their destination.   These pneumatic tubes, through which the messages are being perpetually shot all day long, have been found of great service, and are now in operation between the office and the principal delivery stations in the City, while they are also used by the Anglo-American, the Indo-European, and the Falmouth and Gibraltar offices, for the transmission of messages to. the central station.

<P>The work in the Metropolitan Gallery, which is always great, is largely increased on the occasion of any of our great cockney festivals, such as the Derby, or the University Boat Race. A dense fog, too, brings much extra business for them, and the <pb id="P.217" n="217"> wires, but for the precaution which the department has been able to take against sudden pressure, would be choked with messages explaining the impossibility of keeping   appointments already made. All the messages for the tube stations are sorted into different pigeon-holes marked with the name of the superintendent.   Some idea of the business done may be guessed, when it is stated that there are already between <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="400">four hundred</num> of these delivery stations in London. 
<P>The Provincial Gallery is more interesting as a show-place for the display of <hi rend=italics>tours de force</hi> than the Metropolitan. Thus, we are taken to <num value="1">one</num> of the Liverpool circuits, furnished with <num value="1">one</num> of Hughes's instruments, the speciality of which is, that it records the message in actual Roman type, and are invited to communicate with the clerk at the instrument in the Liverpool office. We do so, and in less than a minute and a half we see his printed reply come winding, snake-like, out of the instrument.   This Liverpool, by the way, is a very cormorant of telegraphic communication. Already it has <num value="11">eleven</num> direct circuits from the office, and <num value="5">five</num> from the Stock Exchange, making <num value="16">sixteen</num> in all; <num value="67">67</num> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.217" n="2000.07.0083"><HEAD>The Yard Of The <QUOTE>Bull And Mouth</QUOTE> About <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 but it is still clamorous for more, and is likely to have its wishes gratified. This is considered rather a dull time in the office. During the busy season, the daily average of messages sent, exclusive of press messages, has been nearly <num value="20000">20,000</num>; now it is about <num value="16000">16,000</num>.   We can check these figures, if we like, by the aid of the superintendent of <num value="1">one</num> of the checktables close by. Her account, she says, stands at this time (quarter to <measure value="5d." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> p.</measure>m.) at <num value="6500">6,500</num> messages; each of these has been sent twice, representing a total of <num value="13000">13,000</num>, and there is yet plenty of time for the receipt of more. 
<P>This extraordinary collection of apparently the brass butt-ends of fishing-rods, with thin coils of wire running around and between them, is <num value="1">one</num> of the most important of the internal arrangements at the office. It is called the testing-box, and, as its name imports, is the place where the trial of the state and efficiency of all the wires is made. When the engineer's attention is called by a clerk to a fault in the wire which he is working, each <num value="1">one</num> of which has a separate number and letter, he proceeds to the test-box, and, by means of the galvanometer in connection therewith, he is able to ascertain at once <pb id="P.218" n="218"> whether the fault or fracture is at his end of the wire.   Finding it is not there, he then proceeds t[ test the wire in the various sections into which it is divided; thus, supposing it were a north-western wire, he would test the section between the office and Euston, then between Euston and Wolverton, then between Wolverton and Rugby, and so on, until he hit upon the section, and, finally, upon the immediate locality where the fault lay; when the divisional engineer would be instructed as to its whereabouts, and ordered to remedy it. Nearly all the wires radiating from the station are tested at <num value="6">six</num> a.m. every morning, when every terminal station is spoken to and expected to reply, to see if the lines are right throughout.   It is calculated that there are nearly <num value="60">sixty</num> miles of wire under the floor of the Provincial Gallery, merely for making local connections with batteries, &amp;c. 
<P>Another interesting object is the chronopher, or instrument from which all England is supplied with the correct time. <num value="16">Sixteen</num> of the most important cities in the kingdom are in direct communication with this instrument, which is itself in direct communication with the Observatory at Greenwich. At <num value="2">two</num> minutes before <num value="10">ten</num> every morning all other work is suspended, in order that there may be no interference with what is called the <QUOTE>time current,</QUOTE> which, precisely at the striking of the clock, flashes the intelligence to the <num value="16">sixteen</num> stations with which it is in communication.   And not merely at these large towns, but at every post-office throughout the kingdom, the clerks at <num value="2">two</num> minutes before <num value="10">ten</num> are on the look-out for the, signal which is to be passed along the line, and the clocks are adjusted accordingly.   Messrs. Dent, Benson, and all the principal watchmakers in London receive the time every hour from this chronopher.   Time-guns at Newcastle and at Shields are also fired at <measure value="1d." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> p.</measure>m. by batteries connected with the chronopher at the office, the clock attached to which is regulated for accuracy to the <num value="20">twentieth</num> part of a <num value="2">second</num>. 
<P>The principal instruments in use at the office are the single needle, the Morse inker, the Hughes, and the Wheatstone's automatic. 
<P>The single--needle instrument conveys its information by the varying vibrations of an indicator or <QUOTE>needle</QUOTE> between <num value="2">two</num> fixed ivory stops.   It is read by the eye, and its signals are transitory. It is as though the minute-hand of a small clock, or a large watch, were caused by the electric current to perform rapid calisthenic exercises between the points that indicate <num value="11">eleven</num> and <num value="1">one</num> o'clock.   If the minute-hand made <num value="2">two</num> violent efforts to show that it was <num value="1">one</num> o'clock, and after each effort returned exhausted to noon, it would simply indicate the letter M. If panting to go the right way, it made <num value="2">two</num> powerful efforts to go the other way and retired after each effort equally unsuccessful, it would simply indicate the letter I; <num value="1">one</num> such tick to the right would be T, <num value="1">one</num> to the left E.   The letters of the alphabet are thus formed by the movements of the indicator to the right and left of some fixed point, and every word is so spelt out letter by letter. 
<P>The Morse instrument is different.   It depicts its telegraphic language on a long piece of paper that unrolls itself by machinery in tape-like fashion beneath a revolving wheel, <num value="1">one</num> half of which is constantly enjoying a cold bath of ink.   While no electric current flows, the paper is free from this circular pen. When the current is caused to speed its lightning career, the paper is pressed against the wheel, and a thin blue line is traced by the ink which the revolving wheel carries with it on the paper with beautiful regularity.   If a current of very short duration be sent, there is simply a dot, like a full stop, registered on the paper. If the current be maintained for a little longer period, we have a             shown. <num value="1">One</num> dot is the letter E, <num value="1">one</num> dash the letter T, a dot and a dash the letter A, and a dash and a dot the letter N. The letters of the alphabet are thus made up of a series of dots and dashes. 
<P>The signals in both instruments are made by the depression of a small lever, which is moved like the key of a piano. The needle instrument has <num value="2">two</num> keys, <num value="1">one</num> for the movements to the right, the other for the movements to the left. The Morse instrument has but <num value="1">one</num> key, which is depressed as though the telegraphic manipulator wished to play crotchets and quavers on <num value="1">one</num> note, the crotchets forming the dots, the quavers the dashes. 
<P>The Hughes instrument is most readily appreciated by strangers, as it records the message in actual Roman type. 
<P>As regards the Wheatstone instrument, it is only necessary to point out that the speed of the ordinary Morse is dependent upon the rate at which a clerk can manipulate his key.   <num value="40">Forty</num> words a minute is very fast sending, and few, if any, clerks can reach <num value="45">forty-five</num> words per minute.   But there is no limit to the speed of the electric current, and if the messages are sent mechanically, as in the Wheatstone, that is, if the varying currents required to indicate a despatch are regulated by a machine moving with great speed, we are not only independent of the limited powers of the human hand, but made free from the liability to error in meting out the proper duration of the signal. Thus great accuracy and great speed can be simultaneously attained. <pb id="P.219" n="219"> 
<P>There are instruments, also, that appeal to the ear as well as to the eye.   Bright's bell is an instrument which indicates its telegraphic language by sound; bells of different notes struck by little hammers connected with the right and left movements of the needle, and the dot and dash of the Morse.   These little tinkling talkers rattle forth their information   with great speed, and many clerks are to be seen writing for their very lives to keep up at the rapid rate at which the bells are speaking. 
<P>The staff at present employed by the office consists of between <num value="7">seven</num> and <num value="800">eight hundred</num> clerks, of whom about a <num value="3">third</num> are men, and <num value="2">two</num>-thirds women.   Of the latter, some come on duty at <num value="8">eight</num> a.m., and leave at <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> p.</measure>m.; others arrive at <num value="12">twelve</num> noon, and leave at <measure value="8d." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num> p.</measure>m. It is noticeable that no women are on duty before <num value="8">eight</num> a.m. or after <measure value="8d." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num> p.</measure>m.; but the night duties are performed by a special night male staff, who are employed from <measure value="8d." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num> p.</measure>m. to <num value="9">nine</num> a.m., under the superintendence of a clerk in charge.   Before the transfer of the office to the Government, the male and female staff were kept rigidly apart, and marriage between any members of either entailed the loss of situation on both the contracting parties. But a paternal Government looks upon these matters with a much more benevolent eye, and so far from forbidding matrimony, is understood to encourage it. 
<P>The old sanctuary privileges of St. Martin'sle-Grand led to infinite mischief. There is no doubt that up to the time of the mischievous and abused rights of sanctuary being abolished, St. Martin'sle-Grand was a mere refuge for rogues, ruffians, thieves, and murderers. Any rascal who stabbed his pot-companion, or struck down an innocent traveller in a dark bye-street, any red-handed brawler, could rush through the monastic gates and shelter himself in this den of crime. Here also, says Stow, harboured picklocks, forgers, coiners, makers of sham jewellery, carders, dicers, and other gamblers. After the dissolution a tavern was built where the college church had stood. 
<P>In Elizabethan times, when sanctuary privileges were still claimed, French, German, Dutch, and Scotch artificers settled here. Here lived shoemakers, tailors, button-makers, goldsmiths, pursemakers, drapers, and silk-weavers, and the <num value="1">first</num> Flemish silk-throwers settled here.   In <datestruct value="1569--"><year reg="1569">1569</year></datestruct> the number of inhabitants was <num value="269">269</num>. There were frequently disorders in this turbulent Liberty, the inhabitants of which often objected to pay taxes, in the Plague-time refused when stricken to close their doors and windows, and often erased the red cross set upon their houses, and even threatened the constable and headboroughs who, according to law, painted them up. <QUOTE>And some,</QUOTE> says Stow, <QUOTE>repaired to the court with their wares, a thing dangerous to the queen and nobility ;</QUOTE> and, there being no prison in the Liberty, the Liberty people sent to the Gate House at Westminster frequently brought actions for such illegal imprisonment.

<P>On the west side of Aldersgate Street stood the London residence of the Nevilles, Earls of Westmoreland (still indicated by Westmoreland Buildings), and close on the site of Bull and Mouth Street, stood the mansion of the Percys, Earls of Northumberland.

<P>Jewin Street, Aldersgate, in Stow's time was full of <QUOTE>fair garden plots and summer houses for pleasure.</QUOTE> It was anciently called <QUOTE>Leyrestow,</QUOTE> and was granted by Edward I. to William de Monteforte, Dean of St. Paul's. For several centuries this spot was the only <num value="1">one</num> allowed the London Jews as a place of interment   but in the reign of Henry II., after long suits to King and Parliament, they obtained leave to buy local graveyards. 
<P>Aldersgate Street, dear to business men for its Post Office, is hallowed to authors by having once, as we have already said, been the residence of Milton.   Here the poet came, with bag and baggage, in <datestruct value="1643--"><year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct>, the year after Edgehill, removing from St. Bride's Churchyard, the site of the present 
<title>Punch</title> office, where he had kept a small school. This residence is especially interesting to those who honour our great poet, as it was here he became reconciled to Mary Powell, his <num value="1">first</num> wife, the daughter of an Oxfordshire Cavalier. As a <num value="1">first</num> step to their re-union, Milton placed his wife in the house of <num value="1">one</num> Widow Weber, in St. Clement's Churchyard.      Mr. Jesse has pointed   out very happily the possible reminiscence contained   in <QUOTE>Paradise   Lost</QUOTE> to this reconciliation.      In his beautiful description of Adam's reconciliation with Eve, after their fall, Milton, says Mr. Jesse, had evidently in his mind his own <num value="1">first</num> interview with his repentant wife, after her unhappy estrangement- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>She, not repulsed, with tears that ceased not flowing,

Here he remained till <datestruct value="1647"><year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct>, when he took a smaller house in High Holborn, overlooking Lincoln's Inn Fields. After the Restoration he removed to a house in Jewin Street, where he married his <num value="3">third</num> wife. 
<P>On the east side of Aldersgate Street, Nos. <num value="35">35</num> to <num value="38">38</num> (still distinguished by a series of <num value="8">eight</num> pilasters), stands <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.220.1">Shaftesbury or Thanet House</LEMMA>, <num value="1">one</num> of Inigo Jones's fine old mansions, formerly the London residence of the Tuftons, Earls of Thanet.      From   them it passed into the family of that clever and dangerous political intriguer, 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.220.2">Anthony   Ashley   Cooper</LEMMA>, Earl of Shaftesbury, the hated <QUOTE>Achitophel</QUOTE> of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.220.3">Dryden</LEMMA>, of whom it was said in jest that he hoped to be chosen King of Poland.      He was the idol of the anti- Popery apprentices, the hatcher of the Popish plot, the rival of Buckingham for the favour of the Whigs, a man seditious and restless as Wilkes, yet, like that demagogue, a constant striver for constitutional liberty. Sir Walter Scott, in the Notes to his edition of <title>Dryden,</title> anticipatory of his 
<title>Peveril of the Peak,</title> says of Shaftesbury- 
<P> <QUOTE>Being heir to   a plentiful fortune, a Member of Parliament, and high sheriff of the county of Dorset, he came to Oxford when the Civil War broke out, and though then only twentyone or <num value="22">twenty-two</num> years of age, presented to the king a digested plan for compromising matters between him and his subjects in arms against him. Charles observed, he was a very young man for so great an undertaking; to which, with the readiness which marked his character, he answered, that would not be the worse for the king's affairs, provided the business was done.   He had, in consequence, a commission from the king to promise indemnity and redress of grievances to such of the Parliamentary garrisons as would lay down their arms. Accordingly, his plan seems to have taken some effect; for Weymouth actually surrended to the king, and Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, as his style then was, was made governor.   Some delays occurred in the course of his obtaining this office; and whether disgusted with these, and giving scope to the natural instability of his temper, as is intimated by Clarendon, or offended, as Mr. Locke states, at Weymouth having been plundered by Prince Maurice's forces, he made <num value="1">one</num> of those sudden turns, of which his political career furnishes several instances, and went over to the other side.

<P>Thomas Flatman, that tame poet of Charles II.'s time, whom   almost every   witling   of the period belaboured, was born in Aldersgate Street in <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Almost opposite to   Shaftesbury   House stood Petre House, the residence of the Petre family in the great Elizabethan times; and of Henry Pierrepoint, Marquis of Dorchester, in the days of the Commonwealth. It was also used as a state prison in the Commonwealth-times, and subsequently became the temporary abode of the Bishops of London, after the Great Fire had treated their mansion in St. Paul's Churchyard in a Puritanical and remorseless way. In <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>, when the selfish Princess Anne deserted her father, James II., and fled at night from Whitehall, she was conducted by the warlike Bishop Compton to his house in Aldersgate Street in a hackney coach. 
<P>The street of which we are taking stock in this chapter contains singularly few   churches.   St. Anne-in-the-Willows we have already visited (somewhat, perhaps, out of sequence); the remaining church, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.221.1">St. Botolph's</LEMMA> at the corner of Little Britain, but for its mean   bell-turret and pretty fizzing fountain, singularly resembles a meeting-house. It was erected in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct> on the site of the old building, which had escaped the Great Fire. An old Jacobean pulpit in the vestibule is the only relic of the   old church, except the few uninteresting   monuments. There is <num value="1">one</num> to a worthy Dame Anne Packington (died <datestruct value="1563--"><year reg="1563">1563</year></datestruct>),   who founded almshouses near the White Friars' Church, in Fleet Street, which were left under the superintendence of the Clothworkers' Company; <num value="1">one</num> to Richard Chiswell, an eminent bookseller (died <datestruct value="1711--"><year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct>), and another to an Elizabeth Smith, with a cameo bust by Roubiliac. 
<P>At the north-east end of this street of noblemen's houses, not far from Shaftesbury House, stood Lauderdale House, the residence of that cruel and unprincipled minister of Charles II.   Lauderdale was <num value="1">one</num> of those <num value="5">five</num> <QUOTE>thorough-going</QUOTE> adherents of Charles II. who formed the <QUOTE>cabal</QUOTE> (Clifford, Ashley, Buckingham, Arlington, and Lauderdale), after Clarendon's exile, and the death of Southampton and Monk.

There was a house in Blackfriars which he purchased in <datestruct VALUE="1612-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>-<num value="13">13</num>, from Henry Walker <QUOTE>abutting from a street leading down to Puddle Wharf, on the east part, right against the King's Majesty's Wardrobe,</QUOTE> and the counterpart of the original conveyance of which (bearing the signature of Shakespeare), is in the library at Guildhall That house is of course undoubtedly connected with Shakespeare; but although he was the owner of it, none of his editors believe he ever lived in it. Mr. Knight and other commentators conjecture that this house was purchased in reference to some object connected with Blackfriars Theatre; but in addition to that-although we do not positively know when Shakespeare retired from London-all his biographers are of opinion that he left London, and went back to his native Stratford to spend the remainder of his days, about the year   <datestruct value="1610"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct> or <datestruct value="1611--"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>. The only other place <hi rend=italics>probably</hi> connected with Shakespeare's name was a property in St. Helen's parish, in the ward of Bishopsgate.   There is a

 subsidy roll of <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, preserved at the Carlton Ride, in which the name of <QUOTE>William Shakespeare</QUOTE> occurs as the owner of property then to the value of   <measure value="5l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5">5</num></measure>. and on which a tax of <measure value="13s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="13">13</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> was assessed.   But that roll has the memorandum <QUOTE>affid.</QUOTE> affixed to his name, and that means that an affidavit had been produced, showing that he did not reside in the parish or district.   Shakespeare's name, in respect of that property, does not occur before <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, nor is it heard of after that date.   Besides, we are not to jump to the conclusion that every William Shakespeare then living in London was <hi rend=italics>our</hi> William Shakespeare.   These are the only <num value="2">two</num> houses in London that can be associated with Shakespeare, and they have long since been improved off the face of the earth.   The concocter of the board, says the antiquary we have quoted, finding out that a public-house in that neighbourhood had been mentioned as having been a place of resort of the most celebrated wits of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, at once jumped to the conclusion that this was <QUOTE>the house,</QUOTE> and further, that Shakespeare, being a wit of that period, he took it for granted that the poet came there to slake his thirst, and so tickets this house with Shakespeare's name. <pb id="P.223" n="223"> 
<P>Barbican, an essential tributary of Aldersgate Street, derives its Saracenic-sounding name, according to all old London antiquaries, from the Saxon words, <QUOTE>burgh kennin,</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>postern tower,</QUOTE> the remains of which existed a little north of the street till towards the end of the last century. According to Bagford, a good old London antiquary, who died in <datestruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>, and who, from being a shoemaker, turned bookseller, printer, and collector of books for the Earl of Oxford, the Romans kept watch at night in that tower, and gave notice of conflagrations, or an approaching army. At night they lit bonfires on the top of the turret, to guide travellers to the City. 
<P>In the reign of Edward III the Barbican was

 entrusted to Robert Ufford, Earl of Suffolk, no doubt a valiant and stout knight, in whose family it remained hereditary, through the female line, till the reign of Queen Mary. In that cruel reign it is on record that the Barbican (then a mere sinecure, and no longer needed by the City for defence) was in the keeping of the Baroness Katharine Willoughby d&lsquo;Eresby, baroness in her own right, and widow of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, who lived in a lordly mansion near the spot. This was that daring Protestant lady who so narrowly escaped the Smithfield fires for calling her lap-dog Gardiner (after the detested bishop, Bonner's worthy yoke-fellow), and dressing him up in small episcopal rochet and surplice. For this practical <pb id="P.224" n="224"> joke the jocose lady and Richard Bertie, her <num value="2">second</num> husband, ancestor of the Dukes of Ancaster, had to fly to Poland, where the king, according to Mr. Jesse, installed them in the earldom of Crozan. 
<P>On the site of Bridgewater Square resided the Egertons, Earls of Bridgewater, in   a mansion famous for its fruitful orchards. The house was burnt down in <datestruct VALUE="1687-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct>, during the occupancy of John, <num value="3">third</num> earl, <QUOTE>when his <num value="2">two</num> infant heirs,</QUOTE> says Mr. Jesse, <QUOTE>Charles, Viscount Brackley, and his <num value="2">second</num> son Thomas, perished in the flames.</QUOTE> Hatton, in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, calls Bridgewater Square <QUOTE>a new, pleasant, though very small square;</QUOTE> and Strype mentions it as <QUOTE>well inhabited, the middle neatly enclosed with palisado pales, and set round with trees, which renders the place very delightful.</QUOTE> 
<P>Sir Henry Spelman (born <datestruct value="1562--"><year reg="1562">1562</year></datestruct>), the learned and laborious author of the <title>Glossarium,</title>   that great archaeological work completed by Dugdale, died at his house in Barbican, <datestruct value="1640--"><year reg="1640">1640</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Beech Lane, Barbican, where Prince   Rupert resided, and worked on his chemical experiments and his mezzotint plates, was probably so called, says Stow, from   Nicholas de la. Beech, Lieutenant of the Tower, who was deprived of his office by Edward III.   Stow, whose clue we ever follow, describes the lane, in Elizabeth's time, as stretching from Redcross Street to Whitecross Street, and adorned with <QUOTE>beautiful houses of stone, brick, and timber.</QUOTE> An old house in Barbican belonging to the Abbot of Ramsay was afterwards called Drury House, from the worshipful owner, Sir Drew Drury, also of Drury Lane. This was <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.224.1">the house Prince Rupert afterwards   occupied</LEMMA>;   and parts of the mansion were in existence as <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>. Here lived the fiery prince, whom Time had softened into a rough old philosopher, fond of old soldiers, and somewhat of a butt at Whitehall among the scoffing Rochesters of his day, who were all <hi rend=italics>a la mode de France</hi>. Here Evelyn visited Rupert.   In the parish books of St. Giles's, Cripplegate, a guinea is set down as payment to the ringers on the occasion of Charles II. visiting the prince at his Barbican house. In Strype's time the street had lost its gentility, and was inhabited by clothes-salesmen, and on the site of the old watch-tower fronting Redcross Street, stood an ignoble watchhouse for the brawling Mohocks of the day. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.224.2">The Fortune</LEMMA>,   <num value="1">one</num> of the celebrated and <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest Elizabethan theatres, stood between Whitecross Street and Golding Lane.   It was opened about <datestruct value="1600--"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>   by Philip Henslowe and Edward Alleyn; and here, and at the Bear-garden, Bankside, Southwark, of which he was the proprietor, the latter actor derived the money afterwards bestowed on God's-gift College, at Dulwich. An adjoining passage still retains the name of Playhouse Yard. Alleyn's theatre was burnt down in <datestruct value="1621--"><year reg="1621">1621</year></datestruct>, and was shortly afterwards rebuilt, but again destroyed, in <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>, by some rough and fanatical Puritan soldiers. Many of the actors of this theatre, in the last scene of all, when they had shuffled off this mortal coil, were buried at St. Giles's, Cripplegate. 
<P>In Golding Lane also stood <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.224.3">the Nursery</LEMMA>,   a seminary for educating children for the profession of the stage, established in the reign of Charles II., under the auspices (says Mr. Jesse) of Colonel William Legge, Groom of the Bedchamber to that monarch, and uncle to the <num value="1">first</num> Lord Dartmouth. Dryden speaks of it in his <title>Mac Flecknoe</title>:

<P>According to Stow, the antiquaries of his time believed that Little Britain, without Aldersgate, was so called from the Earls of Brittany lodging there, just as Scotland Yard was where the Kings of Scotland took up their quarters,   and Petty Wales, in Thames Street, where Prince Hal held his noisy court. R. B., in Strype, defines Little Britain as stretching from Aldersgate Street, by the corner of St. Botolph's Church, running up   to the Pump; then, as it grows wider, turning north up Duck Lane into another passage turning to <QUOTE>the Lame Hospital, or Bartholomew's Hospital.</QUOTE> It was full of <QUOTE>old booksellers,</QUOTE> especially from the Pump to Duck Lane.   Here, especially during the Commonwealth, any hour in the day, might have been found such amiable dozy old antiquaries as still haunt old bookstalls ( <QUOTE>all these for sixpence each</QUOTE> ), poring over black-letter pamphlets and yellow flyingsheets of the Civil War time, spectacles on nose, and crutch-cane in hand, intent on culling odd <pb id="P.225" n="225"> learning; and errant &lsquo;prentice-boys, their rough hair on end at the wonders of some story-books, which they would have given a month's wages to buy.

Then Little Britain was a plentiful and perpetual emporium   of learned authors; and men went thither as to a market. This drew to the place a mighty trade; the rather because the shops were spacious, and the learned gladly resorted to them, where they seldom failed to meet with agreeable conversation. And the booksellers themselves were knowing and conversable men, with whom, for the sake of bookish knowledge, the greatest wits were pleased to converse. And we may judge the time as well spent there as (in latter days) either in tavern or coffeehouse <gap>  but now this emporium is vanished, and the trade contracted into the hands of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> persons.</QUOTE> 
<P>Isaac Walton sketches Little Britain in his Life of Dr. Robert Sanderson. <QUOTE>About the time,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>of his printing this excellent preface,</QUOTE> that is to say, the preface to his last <num value="20">twenty</num> sermons, <num value="1">first</num> printed in <datestruct value="1655--"><year reg="1655">1655</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>I met him   accidentally in London, in sad-coloured clothes, and, God knows, far from being costly. The place of our meeting was near to Little Britain, where he had been to buy a book, which he then had in his hand. We had no inclination to part presently, and therefore turned to stand in a corner under a penthouse (for it began to rain), and immediately the wind rose, and the rain increased so much, that both became so inconvenient as to force us into a cleanly house, where we had bread, cheese, ale, and a fire for our money.</QUOTE> 
<P>Here, too, Milton's great work was published, and lay for a time unnoticed on the stalls. <QUOTE>Dr. Tancred Robinson,</QUOTE> says Richardson, in his <title>Remarks,</title> <QUOTE>has given permission to use his name, and what I am going to relate he had from   Fleet (wood) Shepherd at the Grecian Coffee House, and who often told the story. The Earl of Dorset was in Little Britain, beating about for books to his taste; there was  <Q>Paradise Lost.</Q>  He was surprised with some passages he struck upon, dipping here and there, and bought it.   The bookseller begged him to speak in its favour if he lik'd it, for that they lay on his hands as waste paper; Jesus- Shepherd was present.   My Lord took it home, read it, and sent it to Dryden, who in a short time returned it.  <Q>This man (says Dryden) cuts us all out, and the ancients too.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P>Later still we find that amiable writer, Washington Irving, wandering contemplatively in Little Britain. <QUOTE>In the centre of the great City of London,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>lies a small neighbourhood, consisting of a cluster of narrow streets and courts, of very venerable and debilitated houses, which goes by the name of  <Q>Little Britain.</Q>    Christ Church School and   St. Bartholomew's Hospital bound it on   the west; Smithfield and Long Lane on the north; Aldersgate Street, like an arm of the sea, divides it from the eastern part of the City; whilst the yawning gulf of Bull-and-Mouth Street separates it from Butcher Lane, and   the   regions of Newgate. Over this little territory, thus bounded and designated, the great dome of St. Paul's, swelling above the intervening houses of Paternoster Row, Amen Corner, and Ave-Maria Lane, looks down with an air of motherly protection.. But though thus fallen into decline, Little Britain still bears traces of its former splendour.   There are several houses ready to tumble down, the fronts of which are magnificently enriched with old oak carvings of hideous faces, unknown birds, beasts, and fishes; and fruits and flowers which it would perplex a naturalist to classify. There are also, in Aldersgate Street, certain remains of what were once spacious and lordly family mansions, but which have in latter days been   subdivided   into   several tenements. Here may often be found the family of a petty tradesman, with its trumpery furniture, burrowing among the relics of antiquated   finery, in great rambling   time-stained apartments,   with   fretted ceilings, gilded cornices, and enormous marble fireplaces. The lanes and courts also contain many smaller houses, not on so grand a scale, but, like your small ancient gentry, sturdily maintaining their claims to equal antiquity. These have their gable ends to the street; great bow windows, with diamond panes set in lead, grotesque carvings, and low-arched doorways.</QUOTE> <NOTE> <QUOTE>It is evident,</QUOTE> remarks a note in the complete edition of <title>The Works of Washington Irving, New York, <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>,</title> vol, ii., p. <num value="308">308</num>, <QUOTE>that the author has included, in his general title of Little Britain, many of those little lanes and courts that belong immediately to Cloth Fair.</QUOTE> </NOTE>
 
<P>In Aldersgate, Street in <datestruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct> (the year after the Restoration), died Brian Walton, Bishop of Chester, a laborious and learned scholar, who edited and in <datestruct value="1657--"><year reg="1657">1657</year></datestruct> published the <num value="1">first</num> English Polyglot Bible, in the Hebrew, Syriac;   Chaldee, Samaritan, Arabic, Ethiopic, Persian, Greek, and Vulgar Latin languages.   Before the war Walton had been rector of St. Martin Orgars and St. Giles-in-the-Fields. He was a good deal hunted about during the Civil Wars for his zeal for tithes, yet the Preface of his Bible contains compliments to Cromwell, which <pb id="P.226" n="226">

<P>Close to Shaftesbury House-which, after being a tavern and a lying--in hospital, became in <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct> a general dispensary, and latterly was divided into shops-stood Bacon House, the residence of Sir Nicholas Bacon (Queen Elizabeth's Lord Keeper), an enemy to Mary, Queen of Scots, and the Jesuits, a resolute, honest, unambitious man, and, the father of the great philosopher and Lord Chancellor, Francis Bacon. The Lord Chancellor, however, was born at York House in the Strand, of which Buckingham   Street marks the site. A popular writer has thus graphically described Bacon's father:-- <QUOTE>Huge in person, gouty, asthmatic, high in flesh, Sir Nicholas could not walk from Whitehall to York House without sitting down to rest and blowing for his breath; and this weakness in his legs and chest descended to both his sons by Lady Anne. Queen Elizabeth, laughing, used to say the soul of her lord keeper was well lodgedin fat j but the lusty old knight, who had mother-wit of his own, could have been as brightly sarcastic as the queen. His was a shrewd saying:  <Q> Let us take time, that we may have sooner done.</Q>  When Elizabeth, tripping into the hall at Redgrave, cried,  <Q>My lord, what a little house you have gotten!</Q>  he adroitly answered,  <Q>Madam, my house is well; but you have made me too great for my house.</Q>  When an impudent thief named Hogg asked mercy from him as judge, on the plea of kindred between the Hoggs and Bacons, he replied,  <Q>Ah, you and I cannot be of kin until you have been hanged!</Q> </QUOTE>

After his voice failed him, he was enlisted in the standing company at the Drury   Lane Theatre, assisting in the scene-painting and property department,   and doing small  parts in the pantomime openings.    It was at the Grecian Saloon that Fredrick Robson also made his marl with the London playgoers, in the characters of <QUOTE>Jacob Earwig,</QUOTE> in <title>Boots at the Swan</title>, and <QUOTE>Wormwood</QUOTE> in The <title>Lottery Ticket</title>. William Farren, that excellent actor, had seen and admired Robson's wonderful abilities, and wished to secure his services for the Olympic; but fearing the announcement <QUOTE>from   the Grecian Saloon</QUOTE> might act detrimentally with public opinion, he got Robson an engagement in Ireland, and then, announcing him <QUOTE>from the Theatre Royal Dublin,</QUOTE> launched him on his brilliant career at the little theatre in Wych Street. 
<P>The <QUOTE>Old Milestone,</QUOTE> City Road; opposite Goswell Street Road, was, in the early part of the present century, much patronised by Cockney tourists, on account of its pretty tea-gardens, and like White Conduit House and Bagnigge Wells, it attracted immense crowds of Sunday ramblers. Concerts were <pb id="P.228" n="228"> occasionally given here, particularly at holiday times, but its modern reputation was chiefly owing to its Judge and Jury Society, and the forensic ability of its proprietor, Mr. Benjamin Foster, who was afterwards so well-known and respected by literary men as mine host of the <QUOTE>Saint John's Gate,</QUOTE> or Gate House, Clerkenwell. 
<P>Very near Aldersgate stood   Northumberland House, where the fiery Hotspur, who owes all the emblazonment on his escutcheon to Shakespeare, once dwelt. Henry IV. gave the house to Queen Jane, his wife, and it was then called her Wardrobe. In Stow's time it was the house of a printer-not, however, John Day, the celebrated printer of Elizabeth's time, as has been suggested, for he lived,

 as we have shown, over the Gate itself, as the illustrious Cave did at St. John's Gate, Clerkenwell. It afterwards, in Strype's time, was a tavern, the usual end of all celebrated London buildings. 
<P>Adjoining what is at present the Money Order Office in St. Martin's-le-Grand is the French Protestant Church, opened in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>, when St. Mary's Chapel, in Threadneedle Street, was taken down.

<P>Stow, quoting a history of Edmund the Martyr, King of the East Angles, by Abbo Floriacensis, says that in <datestruct value="1010--"><year reg="1010">1010</year></datestruct>, when the Danes approached Bury St. Edmunds, Bishop Alwyn removed the body of the martyred king to St. Gregory's Church, near St. Paul's; and as it passed through Cripplegate, such was the blessed influence it diffused, that many lame persons rose upright, and began to praise God for their miraculous cure. The postern afterwards became a prison, like the Compter, for debtors and common trespassers.   <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.229.1">The   gate</LEMMA> was rebuilt, says Fabian, by the Brewers of London, in <datestruct value="1244--"><year reg="1244">1244</year></datestruct>, and again in <datestruct value="1491--"><year reg="1491">1491</year></datestruct>, at the cost of <measure value="400bmark" type=currency><num value="400">400</num> marks</measure>, money left by Edmund Shaw, goldsmith and exmayor. It was again repaired and beautified, and a foot-postern made, in the <num value="15">15th</num> Charles II. The <num value="68">68</num>

<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.230.1">The church of St. Giles's, Cripplegate</LEMMA>, is the successor of <num value="1">one</num> founded some <num value="24">twenty-four</num> years after the Conquest. It suffered greatly by fire in <datestruct value="1545--"><year reg="1545">1545</year></datestruct> (Henry VIII.)   Matilda, queen of Henry I., had founded a brotherhood there, dedicated to St. Mary and St. Giles. The church was repaired, and perhaps partially rebuilt, after the fire of <datestruct value="1545--"><year reg="1545">1545</year></datestruct>. <QUOTE>Since that event,</QUOTE> says Mr. Godwin, <QUOTE>it has undergone miscalled adornments, but has not been materially changed.</QUOTE> The tower was raised <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet in <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct>. St. Giles's had a peal of <num value="12">twelve</num> bells, besides <num value="1">one</num> in the turret. It also boasts <num value="1">one</num> of the sets of chimes in London. Those of St. Giles were, it is said, constructed by a poor working man. <pb id="P.230" n="230"> 
<P>In the north aisle of this interesting and historical church lies a great benefactor to London antiquaries, the learned and laborious John Speed, the great topographical writer, who died   <datestruct value="1629--"><year reg="1629">1629</year></datestruct>. He was a wise tailor whom   Sir Fulke Greville patronised, and who was assisted in his labours by Cotton and Spelman.   He had in his time <num value="12">twelve</num> sons and <num value="6">six</num> daughters.   <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.230.2">His marble monument</LEMMA> is adorned with an effigy of Speed   (once gilt and painted), holding in <num value="1">one</num> hand a book, and in the other a skull.     The long   eulogistic Latin   inscription describes   him   as <QUOTE lang=la>Civis Londinensis Mercatorum Scissorum Fratris.</QUOTE> It is a singular fact that <num value="2">two</num> of the great London antiquaries should have been tailors, yet the sartor's is undoubtedly a contemplative trade, and we owe both worthies much gratitude for laboriously stitching together such a vast patchwork of interesting facts. 
<P>Considering that Foxe, the martyrologist (buried, it is believed, on the south side of the chancel) was sheltered by Sir Thomas Lucy, Shakespeare's traditional persecutor- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote>At home a poor scarecrow, in London an ass,</QUOTE>
 it is singular to find near the centre of the north aisle of St. Giles's a monument to Constance Whitney, eldest daughter of Sir Robert Whitney, and granddaughter of Sir Thomas Lucy, who died at the age of <num value="17">seventeen</num>, excelling <QUOTE>in all noble qualities becoming a virgin of so sweet proportion of beauty and harmonie of parts.</QUOTE> From this maiden's grave a lying tradition has sprung like a fungus. 
<P>The striking-looking monument represents a female in a shroud rising from a coffin. According to tradition it commemorates the story of a lady who, after having been buried while in a trance, was not only restored to life, but subsequently became the mother of several children, her resuscitation, it is said, having been brought about by the cupidity of a sexton, which induced him to open the coffin, in order to obtain possession of a valuable ring on her finger. This story, however, is entirely fabulous. 
<P>A   small white marble tablet within the communion-rails also records another Lucy. The inscription is- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote>Here lies Margaret Lucy, the <num value="2">second</num> daughter of Sir Thomas Lucy, of Charlcott in the county of Warwicke, Knight (the <num value="3">third</num> by imediate discent of the name of Thomas), by Alice, sole daughter and heire of Thomas Spenser, of Clarenden, in the same county, Esq., and Custos Brevium of the Courte of Comon Pleas at Westminster, who departed this life the <datestruct VALUE="1634-11-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> day of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1634">1634</year></datestruct>, and aboute the <num value="19">19th</num> year of her age.   For discretion and sweetnesse of conversation not many excelled, and for pietie and patience in her sicknesse and death, few equalled her; which is the comforte of her nearest friendes, to every of whom shee was very dear, but especiallie to her old grandmother, the Lady Constance Lucy, under whose government shee died, who, having long exspected every day to have gone before her, doth now trust, by faith and hope in the precious bloode of Christ Jesus, shortly to follow after, and be partaker, together with her and others, of the unspeakable and eternell joyes in His blessed kingdome; to whom be all honour, laude, and praise, now and ever. Amen.</QUOTE>
 
<P>In this church, too, after many a voyage and many a battle, rests that old Elizabethan warrior and explorer, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.230.3">Sir Martin Frobisher</LEMMA>, who was brought here in <datestruct VALUE="1594-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1594">1594</year></datestruct>-<num value="5">5</num>, after receiving his death shot at Brest.     His northern discoveries while in search of a north-west passage to China, in a mere fishing-boat of <num value="25">twenty-five</num> tons, his West Indian cruise with Drake, and his noble courage against the Spanish Armada, fully entitle Frobisher to rank as <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest of our naval heroes. 
<P>Above all, Milton is buried here. A sacrilegious desecration of his remains, we regret to record, took place in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>.   The object of the search for the sacred body was reasonable, the manner of the search disgraceful. The church being under repair, and <measure value="1350l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1350">1,350</num></measure> being spent upon it, the vestry clerk and churchwardens had agreed--as a monument to Milton was contemplated at St. Giles's, and the exact spot of the poet's interment only traditionally known--to dig up the coffin whilst the repairs were still going on.   The difficulty was this: the parish tradition had always been that Milton was buried in the chancel, under the clerk's desk, where afterwards the common councilmen's pew stood, in the same grave with his father, the scrivener, of Bread Street.   He died <num value="14">fourteen</num> years after the <QUOTE>blessed Restoration,</QUOTE> of consumption, say the parish books, not gout, at his house in Bunhill Fields. Aubrey, in <datestruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></datestruct>, says, <QUOTE>The stone is now removed, for about <num value="2">two</num> years since the <num value="2">two</num> steps to the communiontable were raised.</QUOTE> During the repairs of <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct> the pulpit was removed from the <num value="2">second</num> pillar on the north side to the south side of the old chancel, which was then covered with pews.   The parish clerks and sextons, forgetting this change, used to show a grave on the south side as Milton's, and Mr. Baskerville, to show his reverence for Milton, was buried in this wrong spot. 
<P>The right spot was at last remembered, the ground was searched, and Milton's leaden coffin discovered, directly over the wooden <num value="1">one</num> of his father. The coffin, which was old, and bore no inscription, was <num value="5">five</num> feet <num value="10">ten</num> inches in length. The following ghoulish and disgraceful scene, described by P. Neve, in his 
<title>Narrative of the Disinterment of Milton's Coffin</title>, <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, then took place.   The disinterment had been agreed upon after a merry meeting at the house of Mr. Fountain, overseer, in Beech Lane, the night <pb id="P.231" n="231"> before, Mr. Cole, another overseer, and the journeyman of Mr. Ascough, the parish clerk, who was a coffin-maker, assisting. 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>Holmes, the journeyman, having fetched a mallet and a chisel, and cut open the top of the coffin, slantwise from the head, as low as the breast, so that, the top being doubled backward, they could see the corpse, he cut it open also at the foot. Upon <num value="1">first</num> view of the body, it appeared perfect, and completely enveloped in the shroud, which was of many folds, the ribs standing up regularly. When they disturbed the shroud the ribs fell. Mr. Fountain confessed that he pulled hard at the teeth, which resisted, until some <num value="1">one</num> hit them a knock with a stone, when they easily came out. There were but <num value="5">five</num> in the upper jaw, which were all perfectly sound and white, and all taken by Mr. Fountain. He gave <num value="1">one</num> of them to Mr. Laming. Mr. Laming also took <num value="1">one</num> from the lower jaw; and Mr. Taylor took <num value="2">two</num> from it. Mr. Laming said that he had at <num value="1">one</num> time a mind to bring away the whole under-jaw with the teeth in it; he had it in his hand, but tossed it back again.   Also, that he lifted up the head, and saw a great quantity of hair, which lay strait and even, behind the head, and in the state of hair which had been combed and tied together before interment; but it was wet, the coffin having considerable corroded holes, both at the head and foot, and a great part of the water with which it had been washed on the Tuesday afternoon having run into it. 
<P>Elizabeth Grant, the gravedigger, and who is servant to Mrs. Hoppy, therefore now took possession of the coffin; and, as its situation under the common councilmen's pew would not admit of its being seen without the help of a candle, she kept a tinder-box in the excavation, and, when any persons came, struck a light, and conducted them under the pew; where, by reversing the part of the lid which had been cut, she exhibited the body, at <num value="1">first</num> for sixpence and afterwards for threepence and twopence each person.   The workmen in the church kept the doors locked to all those who would not pay the price of a pot of beer for entrance, and many, to avoid that payment, got in at a window at the west end of the church, near to Mr. Ayscough's counting-house.</QUOTE>
 
<P>The hair torn off the poet's forehead resembled the short locks seen in Faithorne's quarto print of Milton taken in <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">four</num> years only before the poet's death. In Charles II.'s time, coffin-plates were not generally used, and it was only usual to paint the name, &amp;c., on the outer wooden case. The rascals altogether stole a rib-bone, <num value="10">ten</num> teeth, and several handfuls of hair. 
<P>Upon this sacrilege Cowper, horrified, wrote these lines:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=stanza><L>Ill fare the hands that heaved the stones 
<L>Where Milton's ashes lay, 
<L>That trembled not to grasp his bones, 
<L>And steal his dust away.</LG><LG type=stanza><L>O, ill-requited bard! neglect 
<L>Thy living worth repaid, 
<L>And blind idolatrous respect 
<L>As much affronts the dead!</QUOTE>
 
<P>In all fairness, however, it must be added that grave doubts have been raised as to whether the corpse found was really that of the poet. Immediately on the publication of Mr. Neve's Narrative, it was ably answered in the <title>St. James's Chronicle,</title>
 in <QUOTE><num value="9">Nine</num> Reasons why it is improbable that the coffin lately dug up in the Parish Church of St. Giles, Cripplegate, should contain the reliques of Milton.</QUOTE> Mr. Neve, says Todd, <num value="1">one</num> of Milton's biographers, added a postscript to his Narrative, but all his labour appears to have been employed on an imaginary cause.   The late Mr. Steevens, who particularly lamented the indignity which the nominal ashes of the poet sustained, has intimated in his manuscript remarks on this Narrative and Postcript that the disinterred corpse was supposed to be that of a <hi rend=italics>female</hi>, and that the minutest examination of the fragments could not disprove, if it did not confirm, the supposition. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, Samuel Whitbread, Sheridan's friend, erected a bust to Milton in this church with this inscription:--

<P>In this most interesting old church were buried many   illustrious   persons,   recorded   by Stow. Amongst these we may mention Robert Glover, a celebrated Elizabethan herald, who assisted Camden with the pedigrees of his famous <title>Britannia.</title>
 John Foxe, the pious and laborious author of that manual of true Protestantism, <title>The Book of Martyrs,</title> was also interred here, as well as that good old herbalist and physician of Elizabeth's time, Dr. William Bulleyn, author of the <title>Government of Health</title> (<datestruct value="1558--"><year reg="1558">1558</year></datestruct>), and a <title>Book of Simples,</title>
 works full of old wives' remedies and fantastic beliefs. Foxe the martyrologist was a Lincolnshire man, born in <datestruct value="1517--"><year reg="1517">1517</year></datestruct>, the year Luther <num value="1">first</num> openly opposed Romish errors.   At Oxford he became <pb id="P.232" n="232"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.232.1">Porch of St. Alphage</LEMMA></NOTE>
 famous for writing comedies in especially elegant Latin. For his religious opinions he was expelled Magdalen College, of which he was a Fellow, and, forsaken by his friends, he was reduced to great distress, till he was taken as family tutor by Sir Thomas Lucy, of Warwickshire, the Shakesperian traditional persecutor. With this worthy knight he remained till his children arrived at mature years, and had no longer need of a tutor. Now commenced a period of want and despair, which closed with what his son calls, in the Life of his father <QUOTE>a marvellous accident and great example of God's mercy.</QUOTE> 
<P>Foxe was sitting <num value="1">one</num> day in St. Paul's Church, almost spent with long fasting, his countenance wan and pale, and his eyes hollow, when there came to him a person whom he never remembered to have seen before, who, sitting down by him, accosted him very familiarly, and put into his hands an untold sum of money, bidding him to be of good cheer, to be careful of himself, and to use all means to prolong his life, for that in a few days new hopes were at hand, and new means of subsistence. Foxe tried all methods to find out the person by whom he was thus so seasonably relieved, but in vain. 
<P>The prediction was fulfilled, for within <num value="3">three</num> days the starving student was taken by the Duchess of Richmond as tutor to her nephews and niece, the children of the poet Earl of Surrey. At the escape of Surrey's father, the Duke of Norfolk, from prison, on the death of that swollen tyrant, Henry VIII., the duke took Foxe under his patronage, but Bishop Gardiner's determination to seize him compelled Foxe to take refuge in Switzerland. On the accession of Elizabeth, Foxe returned to England, and was made Prebend of Salisbury. Although befriended by Sir Francis Drake, Bishop Grindal, and Sir Thomas Gresham, Foxe never rose high in the church, having Genevese scruples about ecclesiastical vestments, which he was too honest to swallow. Queen Elizabeth used to call the old martyrologist <QUOTE>Father,</QUOTE> but she would not spare, at his intercession, <num value="2">two</num> Anabaptists condemned to the flames. Latterly Foxe denounced the extreme Puritans as <QUOTE>new monks,</QUOTE> who desired to bring all things contrary to their own discipline and consciences <QUOTE>into Jewish bondage.</QUOTE> This worthy man died in <datestruct value="1587--"><year reg="1587">1587</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="70">seventy</num> years, and was buried in St. Giles's Church.

It was built, remarks Cunningham, <QUOTE>in <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct> (it is said by Dance), on the site of the old Hospital or Priory of St. Mary the Virgin, founded for the sustentation of <num value="100">one hundred</num> blind men in <datestruct value="1532--"><year reg="1532">1532</year></datestruct>, by William Elsing, mercer, and of which Spittle, the founder, was the <num value="1">first</num> prior.

Besides the king's --a seated full-length, crowned, and with the sword of state in his right hand--it contains also portraits of eighteen members of the guild, <num value="3">three</num> kneeling on the right hand of the king, and <num value="15">fifteen</num> on the other, and among them are conspicuous our friends Butts and Chamber on the right. The head of the latter is effective and good, though the portraits generally are unsatisfactory; but Warden Aylef's, the <num value="2">second</num> on the left, is especially good. The rest are indifferent, either owing to the fact of their having been some of them   perhaps entirely repainted, or possibly having never had a touch of Holbein's in them. 
<P>There is a large engraving of this picture by B. Baron, but reversed. The names of the members of the guild are written in a most offensive manner over the face of the picture, which is a piece of barbarism that belongs, I imagine, to a period long subsequent to the time of Holbein. These names are J. Alsop, W. Butts, J. Chamber, T. Vycary (the master of the guild, who is receiving the charter from the left hand of the king), T. Aylef, N. Symson, E. Harman, J. Monforde, J. Pen, M. Alcoke, R. Fereis, X. Samon, and W. Tylly; <num value="5">five</num> of the <num value="2">second</num> row are without names. 
<P>The king is placed very stiffly, and the face, much repainted, is that we are familiar with in the many ordinary half-lengths of the king, representing him in the last years of his life. The composition is anything but graceful, and there is not an entire hand in the whole piece; the king's hands are good, though slight and sketchy. The principle of the composition is somewhat Egyptian, for the king is made about twice the size of the other figures, though they are in front of him. 
<P>We have an interesting notice of this picture in Pepys'  <Q>Diary,</Q>  where, against the date <datestruct VALUE="1668-08-29"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=29>29</day>, <year reg=1668>1668</year></datestruct>, that is, <num value="2">two</num> years after the Great Fire, he notes:  <Q>At noon comes, by appointment, Harris to dine with me; and after dinner he and I to Chirurgeons' Hall, where they are building it new, very fine; and there to see their theatre, which stood all the fire, and, which was our business, their great picture of Holbein's, thinking to have bought it, by the help of Mr. Pierce, for a little money. I did think to give <num value="200">200</num> for it, it being said to be worth   <num value="1000">1,000</num>; but it is so spoiled that I have no mind to it, and is not a pleasant though a good picture.</Q>  
<P>Pepys is very candid about his motive for buying the picture; because it was said to be worth a <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds</measure> he was willing to give <num value="200">two hundred</num> for it, not that he wanted the picture for its own sake; however, he did not like it, and he declined the speculation. When we consider the worth of money at that time, the estimated value seems an enormous <num value="1">one</num>. Pepys' own price was not an inconsiderable sum. The picture is on oak, on vertical boards, about <num value="6">six</num> feet high by <num value="10">ten</num> feet <num value="3">three</num> inches in width. The College of Surgeons possesses an old, but smaller, indifferent copy of it, on paper attached to canvas. J. Alsop, on the extreme right, is omitted; and in the place of a tablet with a Latin inscription, which disfigures the Barber-Surgeons' picture, is a window showing the old tower of St. Bride's, indicating, accordingly, the palace of Bridewell as the place of the ceremony. 
<P>There can be no question of the genuineness of this picture in its foundations, but in its present state it is not remarkable that it should cause discussions. I am disposed to believe that Holbein never did finish the picture, and from the great inferiority of the <num value="2">second</num> series of heads on the left hand of the king I think that these must have been added later. There is no trace of Holbein's hand in them; and the fact of <num value="5">five</num> of them being without names is also suggestive of the assumption that these <num value="5">five</num> were not even members of the guild when the picture was painted. <num value="2">Two</num> of this <pb id="P.234" n="234"> background group are named X. Samson and W. Tilley; these, therefore, may have been Holbein's contemporaries, though not introduced by him into the picture. it is not to be supposed that the king sat to Holbein for this portrait; it is the stock portrait of the time. The king is not looking at the master, Vycary, to whom he is handing the charter, but straight before him. The composition is a mere portrait piece, got up for the sake of the portraits. In the whole group of <num value="19">nineteen</num>   only, <num value="5">five</num> besides the king wear their beards-Aylef, Symson, Harman, Alcoke, and Fereis.  Monforde's, the <num value="5">fifth</num> from the king, is a very expressive face, physicians to the considerably   repainted, but full of character. The <num value="3">three</num> on the right- Chamber, Butts, and Alsop--are perhaps so separately placed as physicians to the king.</QUOTE>
 
<P>There is a letter of James I. to the Barber-Surgeons still in their possession.  It is written from Newmarket,   and dated <datestruct value="1617--"><year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct>, requesting the loan of this picture, in order that it should be copied.  In Mr. Wornum's opinion this copy is the <num value="1">one</num> still to be seen at the College of Surgeons in Lincoln's Inn Fields. It was formerly in the possession of Desenfans, and at his sale in <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct> was purchased by the Surgeons' Company for <num value="5">five</num> guineas. In the Lincoln's Inn picture there is a window at the back instead of the tablet with a long complimentary Latin inscription to Henry VIII. It was probably added after the picture had been injured in the Fire of London, where, from what Pepys says, it may have got injured. The Lincoln's Inn picture was cleaned in <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>. The cleaner sent in a bill for <measure value="400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400">400</num></measure>, but eventually took <num value="50">fifty</num> guineas. 
<P>Shortly before this picture of Holbein's was finished Henry (who was always murdering or mar-

 rying) wedded ugly Anne of Cleves, beheaded Cromwell, and married Lady Katherine Howard. Holbein himself, who lived in the parish of St. Andrew Undershaft, died of the plague in the year <datestruct value="1543"><year reg="1543">1543</year></datestruct>, as was proved by Mr. Black's discovery of his hasty will. Before this discovery the date of Holbein's death was generally assigned to <datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct>. 
<P> <QUOTE>Prince Albert,</QUOTE> remarks Aleph, <QUOTE>visited this noble Holbein more desire it was sent to Buckingham   Palace, and remained there a month; but when the directors of the Manchester   Exhibition desired the loan of it they were refused. As doubts were entertained that it would be damaged by remaining in the City, a Royal Commission inspected   it,   and specimens of colours were hung in the hall for several months, with a view to ascertain whether the atmosphere was unfavourable to them, but no change took place, and Dean Milman, with his coadjutors, expressed their conviction that its removal was not desirable.   It is pretended that Henry never sat for any other portrait, and that those of him at Hampton Court are merely copies.                    The other paintings,</QUOTE> continues Aleph, <QUOTE>well deserve notice. <num value="2">Two</num>, certainly, are Vandyke's.   <num value="1">1st</num>.

 <pb id="P.236" n="236"> rather discreditable story. It seems this bust, not many years since,   was found in a lumber-closet. It was of white marble, and the sagacious Master of the day gave orders that it should   be bronzed. There is a doubtful sketch of a head, as it is thought, of Linnaeus, and by whatever artist painted, its merit is of no common order.   Also, portraits of Charles II. and Queen Anne, both benefactors of the Company; of Henry Johnson, a favourite of the Merry Monarch; and of Thomas Lisle, King's barber in <datestruct value="1622--"><year reg="1622">1622</year></datestruct>---the latter a most solemn and imposing-looking personage, who might well pass for the Prime Minister.

It exhibits the arms <hi rend=italics>of</hi> the Company, and   is elaborately wrought over   with innumerable artistic emblems, fruit, flowers, fantastic ornaments, and   gilding. Its history is a strange <num value="1">one</num>. Once on a time a notable felon was <hi rend=italics>hanged</hi> and   his corpse handed over to the Barber-Surgeons for dissection; the operator, fancying   the heart still pulsated, used means for resuscitation, and succeeded. The man was kept hidden for a long while, and then sent abroad at the Company's expense. He ultimately became rich, and in gratitude sent them this screen.</QUOTE>

<P>Lambe's Almshouses stood at the upper end of Monkwell Street.   The worthy clothworker who built these havens of refuge after life's storms was a gentleman of Henry VIII.'s chapel. These almshouses were on the site of an ancient chapel or hermitage, built in the old City wall, about the time of the early Norman kings, and was partly supported by royal stipend assigned to it in <datestruct value="1275--"><year reg="1275">1275</year></datestruct>. Soon after <datestruct value="1346--"><year reg="1346">1346</year></datestruct> it passed into the hands of the Corporation of London, and after the dissolution it was purchased by Lambe. 
<P>This benevolent man also built a conduit at Holborn Bridge, at a cost of   <measure value="1500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1500">1,500</num></measure>, and gave <num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num> pails for carrying water to such poor women <QUOTE>as were willing,</QUOTE> says Strype, <QUOTE>to take pains.</QUOTE> Water was not too plentiful in Elizabethan London. As late as the end of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, carriers with yokes and pails perambulated   the streets, shouting <QUOTE>Any New River water here?</QUOTE> Lambe also founded a school at Sutton Valence, Kent, the place of his birth, and built almshouses there. He gave <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure> to the Shropshire clothiers; gave <measure value="15l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="15">15</num></measure> to Cripplegate parish, for bells, with a bequest of a <measure value="6l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6">6</num></measure> annuity and <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> ready money to Christ's Hospital; left St. Thomas's Hospital, Southwark, <measure value="4l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4">4</num></measure> a year, and bequeathed money to the poor prisoners of the London gaols.

<P>Anthony Munday's account of the perambulation <pb id="P.237" n="237"> of Cripplegate parish is so quaint that we cannot refrain from abridging it, as a good specimen of the old parochial anxiety to preserve the parish bounds. The parishioners, says Stow's continuator, <num value="1">first</num> struck down the alley forming part of their churchyard, close by St. Giles's Well (made at the charge of Richard Whittington), and crossing the tower ditch, kept along by the City wall almost to Aldersgate; they then crossed the ditch again, by certain garden-houses near, and came down a little garden alley (formerly leading into Aldersgate), and returned by St. Giles's Well. They then paraded up the west side of Redcross Street and the south side of Barbican, till they came to the <QUOTE>Boar's Head,</QUOTE> at the end, and there set up their marks on a great post. From there they crossed over to the north side of the street, through certain garden alleys, on the west side of Willoughby House, a course afterwards denied them. They next passed through Barbican, and turned up Goswell Street; a little beyond the bars they set up their marks, and passed along the right side of the King's highway leading to Islington; then leaving the Mount Mill on the right, they proceeded till they came within <num value="3">three</num> rods of a little bridge at the lower end of a close, over which lay a footpath to Newington Green. They then dug a way over the ditch, and passing south-east by the low grounds and brick-fields, left the footpath leading from the Pest House to Islington on the left. From a boundary-stone in the brick-hill they came south to a bridge, temporarily provided for them, and struck down eastward by the ditch side to the farthest conduit head, where they gave the parish children points (metal tags, used to fasten clothes, in the reign of James I., when Munday lived). This was to fix the boundaries in the children's minds. In some parishes children were whipped at the boundaries, a less agreeable method of mnemonics.   From Dame Anne de Clare's famous well, mentioned by Ben Jonson, they pushed on past the Butts, into Holywell Close. Eventually, turning full west over the highway from Moorgate, they came into Little Moorfields; and keeping close to the pales and the Clothworkers' tenters, they reached the Postern, where they put up their final mark, <QUOTE>and so,</QUOTE> as Pepys would say, <QUOTE>home.</QUOTE> 
<P>Basinghall Ward consists of Basinghall Street alone. The present Bankruptcy Court is on the site of the old mansion of the Basings, of whom <num value="1">one</num>, Solomon Basing, was Lord Mayor in the <num value="1">first</num> year of Henry III. To his son, Adam, afterwards mayor, Henry III. gave messuages in Aldermanbury and Milk Street, and the advowson of the church at Basing Hall. According to an old tradition, which Stow derides, the house had once been a Jewish synagogue.   It passed into the hands of the Bakewells, in the reign of Edward III., and in the reign of Richard II. was sold by the king for <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> to the City, who turned it into a cloth exchange, which it continued till <datestruct value="1820"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>, when the present Bankruptcy Court was erected on its site.. In old times no foreigner was allowed to sell any woollen cloth but in Bakewell Hall.   Part of the tolls or hallage was given by Edward VI. to Christ's Hospital, whose governors superintended   the warehouses.   It was rebuilt for <measure value="2500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2500">2,500</num></measure> in <datestruct value="1558--"><year reg="1558">1558</year></datestruct>, destroyed in the Great Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, and re-erected about <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>.

<P>There is a tradition that Lee invented the machine to facilitate the labour of knitting, in consequence of falling in love with a young country girl, who, during his visits, was more attentive to her knitting than to his proposals.

These wards are quite separate, and no communication is permitted between the inmates of <num value="1">one</num> and   another.   Before   commencing our rounds, we gain, from conversation with the intelligent governor, an item or <num value="2">two</num> of useful preliminary   information.   The   establishment is capable of holding <num value="500">500</num> persons.   It is, however, very   seldom   that half   that number <pb id="P.239" n="239"> is confined at <num value="1">one</num> time within its walls. At this period last year it had <num value="147">147</num> inmates; the pressure of the times has since considerably increased the sum-total. There are now <num value="205">205</num>, of which number <num value="8">eight</num> are females. The population of this prison is, moreover, very migratory. Last year there were no less than <num value="1143">1,143</num> commitments. This shows an advance upon previous years--the result of the operation of the Small Debts Act--a part of the building having been set apart for persons committed under that Act.   Many debtors are now sent hither for a fixed term, mostly <num value="10">ten</num> days, at the expiration of which they are discharged. This punishment is principally inflicted for contempt of court. A woman was recently locked up here for <num value="10">ten</num> days, for contempt, because unable, or unwilling, it was difficult to say which, to discharge a debt of sevenpence! In all such cases a more penal discipline is enforced; the person incarcerated is not allowed to maintain him or herself, but is compelled to accept the county allowance. 
<P>Round the yard are the lofty walls of the prison, and the general pile of the prison buildings, several storeys high. On <num value="1">one</num> side is a large board, containing a list of the benefactors of this portion of the prison. There are similar benefactions to each ward.; amongst others, <num value="1">one</num> from   Nell Gwynne, still periodically distributed in the shape of so many loaves of bread, attracts attention. These donations are, now employed in hiring some of the poorer of the prisoners to make the beds; clean the floors, and do other menial offices for the rest. Passing through a door in the yard, we enter the day-room   of this ward.   There are benches and tables down the sides, as in some of the cheap coffee-houses in London, and a large fire at the end, at which each man cooks, or has cooked for him, his victuals. On the wall a number of pigeon-holes or small cupboards are placed, each man having the key of <num value="1">one</num>, and keeping therein his bread and butter, tea and coffee, and so forth. These things are all brought in, and no stint is placed upon the quantity consumed. A man <hi rend=italics>may</hi> exist in the prison who has been accustomed to good living, though he cannot live well. All kinds of luxuries are prohibited, as are also spirituous drinks. Each man may have a pint of wine a day, but not more; and dice, cards; and all other instruments--for gaming, are strictly vetoed.</QUOTE>

<P>Redcross Street derived its name from a cross which stood near the end of Golden Lane, as Whitecross Street did from   a stone cross, near which ran a watercourse to Moorfields. Hughson (<datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>) calls Whitecross Street <QUOTE>noble, wide, and well built, inhabited by persons of property.</QUOTE> Here Dr. Williams <num value="1">first</num> established the Free Library, chiefly for the use of Protestant Dissenting ministers, now   removed to Grafton   Street, Fitzroy Square. Dr. Daniel Williams was a Welsh Nonconformist, in great favour with William III. He was preacher at Hand Alley, Bishopsgate Street, and succeeded Richard Baxter at the lectureship of Pinners' Hall, Broad Street.   Opposed by the Antinomians, the Doctor, with Dr. Bates, Dr. Annerley, and   others, set up the lectures at Salters' Hall, Cannon Street, already described by us. The richer Dissenters erected a building in Whitecross Street, to contain the Doctor's library, generously left for public use, and employed the building as a place of convocation. The building contained <num value="2">two</num> handsome rooms, capable of holding <num value="40000">40,000</num> volumes, though the original collection contained not many more than <num value="16000">16,000</num> (Dr. Bates's and Dr. Williams's libraries formed its basis). There was also a gallery of portraits of celebrated Dissenting ministers.   Among the curiosities mentioned in old guide-books of London were the following: Eighteen volumes of the Bible, written with white ink on black paper, for Mr. Harris, an old linendraper, in <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>, when he had become nearly blind; portraits of Samuel Annesly, an ejected minister of Cripplegate, and grandfather of Wesley;, the preachers at the meeting-house in Little St. Helen's, Bishopsgate Street-John Howe, Dr. Watts, Flavell, Baxter, and Jacomb, The library also contains <num value="238">238</num> volumes of Civil War tracts and sermons; a finely illuminated copy of the Salisbury Liturgy . (<datestruct value="1530--"><year reg="1530">1530</year></datestruct>); the Bible in short-hand, written by a zealous Nonconformist in <datestruct value="1686--"><year reg="1686">1686</year></datestruct>, when the writer was afraid <pb id="P.240" n="240"> James II. would destroy all the Bibles; a mask of Cartouche, the great robber, of Paris; the glass basin in which Queen Elizabeth was christened; a portrait of Colonel John Lilburne, <num value="1">one</num> of the judges of Charles I. The library foundation was, in <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, under the direction of <num value="23">twenty-three</num> trustees, <num value="14">fourteen</num> ministers, and <num value="9">nine</num> laymen, all Dissenters, with a secretary and steward under them. 
<P>Sir Thomas More, in his <title>Pitiful Life of Edward V.,</title> has a curious anecdote about Redcross Street: <QUOTE>And <num value="1">first</num>,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>to show you that by conjecture he (Richard III.) pretended this thing in his brother's life, you shall understand for a truth that the same night that King Edward dyed, <num value="1">one</num> called Mistlebrooke, long ere the day sprung, came to the house of <num value="1">one</num> Pottier, dwelling in Red Crosse Street, without Cripplegate, of London; and when he was, with hasty rapping, quickly let in, the said Mistlebrooke showed unto Pottier that King Edward was that night deceased.  <Q>By my troth,</Q>  quoth Pottier,  <Q>then will my master, the Duke of Gloucester, be king, and that I warrant thee!</Q>  What cause he had so to think, hard it is to say, whether he being his servant, knew any such thing pretended, or otherwise had any inkling

 thereof, but of all likelihood he spake it not of ought.</QUOTE> 
<P>The old Grub Street, the haunt of poor authors, the mosquitoes who tormented Pope, and the humble drudges with whom   Dr. Johnson argued and perambulated in his struggling days, has now changed its name to Milton Street. This absurd transition from Lazarus to Dives, from the dunghill to the palace, originated in the illogical remembrance of some opaque-headed Government official that Milton died at his house in the Artillery Walk, Bunhill Fields, adjoining to which place he had removed soon after his <num value="3">third</num> marriage. The direct association of Pope's Grub Street poets was surely better than the very indirect association of Grub Street with the sacred name of Milton; but officials are like that. Here poor hacks of weak will and mistaken ambition sat up in bed, with blankets skewered round them, and, encouraged by gin, scribbled epics and lampoons, and fulsome dedications to purse-proud patrons. Here poor men of genius, misled by Pleasure's <hi rend=italics>igzis fatuus</hi>, repented too late their misused hours, and, by the flickering rush. light, desperately endeavoured to retrieve the loss of opportunities by satires on ministers, or ribald <pb id="P.241" n="241"> attacks on men more successful than themselves. Here poor wretches, like Hogarth's poet, wrestled with the Muses while the milkman dunned them for their score, or the bailiff's man sat sullenly waiting for the guinea bribe that was to close his <num value="1">one</num> malign eye. We have before alluded to Pope's attacks on his Grub Street enemies, and shown how he degraded literature by. associating poor writers, however industrious or clever, with ribaldry and malice, so that for long Curll's historians, sleeping <num value="2">two</num> in a bed, in Grub Street garrets, were considered the natural kinsmen of all who made literature their profession, and did not earn enormous incomes by the generous but often unremunerative effort of spreading   knowledge, exposing error, and discovering truth.

 plied the archers of Finsbury, Moorfields, and Islington, and who were gradually succeeded by keepers of bowling-alleys and diceing-houses, who always favoured the suburbs, where there was little supervision over them. Dr. Johnson, in his Dictionary, defines Grub Street as <QUOTE>the name of a street in London much inhabited by writers of small histories, dictionaries, and temporary poems; whence any mean production is called Grub Street.</QUOTE> 
<P><title>The Memoirs of the Grub Street Society</title> was the title of a publication commenced <datestruct VALUE="1730-01-8"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=8>8</day>, <year reg=1730>1730</year></datestruct>. Its object was to satirise unsparingly the personages of the <title>Dunciad,</title> and the productions of Cibber, Curll, Dennis, &amp;c. It was continued weekly, till the end of <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>.   The reputed editors were Dr. Martyn, a Cambridge Professor of Botany, and Dr. Richard Russell, who wrote <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest treatises on the beneficial use of salt water. 
<P>Warburton seems prophetically to have <pb id="P.242" n="242"> anticipated a line of Mr. Disraeli's <title>Lothair,</title> when, in a note to the <title>Dunciad,</title> he calls a libeller <QUOTE>nothing but a Grub Street critic run to seed.</QUOTE> Pompous Sir John Hawkins, in his <title>Life of Johnson,</title>- says, <QUOTE>During the usurpation a prodigious number of seditious and libellous pamphlets and papers, tending to exasperate the people and increase the confusion in which the nation was involved, were from time to time published. The authors of these were for the most part men whose indigent circumstances compelled them to live in the suburbs and most obscure parts of the town. Grub Street then abounded with mean old houses, which were let out in lodgings, at low rents, to persons of this description, whose occupation was in publishing anonymous treason and slander. <num value="1">One</num> of the original inhabitants of this street was Foxe, the martyrologist.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1710--"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct>-<num value="11">11</num> Swift writes to Stella of a tax on small publications, which, he says, <QUOTE>will utterly ruin Grub Street.</QUOTE> 
<P>Mr. Hoole, the translator of Tasso, told Dr. Johnson, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, says Boswell, that <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>he was born in Moorfields, and had received part of his early instruction in Grub Street.  <Q>Sir,</Q>  said Johnson, smiling,  <Q>you have been <hi rend=italics>regularly</hi> educated.</Q>  Having asked who was his instructor, and Mr. Hoole having answered,  <Q>My uncle, sir, who was a tailor,</Q>  Johnson, recollecting himself, said,  <Q>Sir, I knew   him; we called him   the <hi rend=italics>metaphysical</hi> tailor. He was of a club in Old Street, with me and George Psalmanazar, and some others; but pray, sir, was he a good tailor?</Q>  Mr. Hoole having answered that he believed he was too mathematical, and used to draw   squares and triangles on his shopboard, so that he did not excel in the cut of a coat.  <Q> I am sorry for it,</Q>  said Johnson,  <Q>for I would have every man to be master of his own business.</Q>  
<P>In pleasant reference to himself and Mr. Hoole, as brother authors, Johnson often said to a friend,  <Q>Let you and I, sir, go together, and eat a beefsteak in Grub Street.</Q> </QUOTE>
 
<P>A remarkable seclusion from   the world took place in Grub Street, in the person of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.242.1">Henry Welby, Esq</LEMMA>.    This gentleman was a native of Lincolnshire, where he had an estate of above <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> per annum. He possessed in an eminent degree the qualifications of a gentleman. Having been a competent time at the university and the inns of court, he completed his education by making the tour of Europe. He was happy in the love and esteem of all that knew him, on account of his many acts of humanity, benevolence, and charity. When he was about <num value="40">forty</num> years of age, it is said that his brother (though another account makes it merely a <hi rend=italics>kinsman</hi>), an abandoned profligate, made an attempt upon his life with a pistol. It missed fire, and Welby, wresting it from the villain's hand, found it charged with bullets. Hence he formed the resolution of retiring from the world; and taking a house in this street, he reserved <num value="3">three</num> rooms for himself--the <num value="1">first</num> for his diet, the <num value="2">second</num> for his lodging, and the <num value="3">third</num> for his study. In these he kept himself so closely retired, that for <num value="44">forty-four</num> years he was never seen by any human creature, except an old female servant that attended him, and who was only permitted to see him in some cases of great necessity. His diet was constantly bread, oatmeal, water-gruel, milk, and vegetables, and as a great indulgence, the yolk of an egg, but no part of the white. 
<P>The hermit of Grub Street bought all the new books that were published, most of which, upon a slight examination, he rejected. His time was spent in reading, meditation, and prayer. No Carthusian monk was ever more rigid in his abstinence. His plain garb, his long and silver beard, his mortified and venerable aspect, bespoke him an ancient inhabitant of the desert, rather than a gentleman of fortune in a populous city. He expended a great part of his income in acts of charity, and was very inquisitive after proper objects.   He died October <num value="291636">29,1636</num>, in the eightyfourth year of his age, and was buried in St. Giles's Church, Cripplegate.   The old servant died not above <num value="6">six</num> days before her master.   He had a very amiable daughter, who married Sir Christopher Hildyard, a gentleman of Yorkshire; but neither she nor any of her family ever saw her father after his retirement. 
<P>A very grand old house in Hanover Yard, near Grub Street,   was sketched by J. T. Smith, in <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>. It was called by the neighbours <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.243.1"> <QUOTE>General Monk's House.</QUOTE> </LEMMA>   On <num value="1">one</num> of the old water-spouts was the date, <datestruct value="1653"><year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>. The lead on the roof was of enormous thickness, the staircase spacious and heavy. The large rooms had ornamented plaster ceilings, and <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num>-floor wainscotings was richly carved with flowers. But the great feature of the old mansion, after all, was the porch, a deep gable-ended structure, supported by stately Ionic pillars, and in the centre of the pediments a lion looking out. The windows were wide and latticed.   There is, however, no proof that General Monk ever resided in the house. When the trimming general returned from   Scotland, he took up his headquarters at Whitehall; and   on   the refractory citizens refusing the      <measure value="60000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="60000">60,000</num></measure> demanded by the Parliament, Monk   marched   into the City, destroyed the portcullises, and drew up his soldiers <pb id="P.243" n="243"> in Finsbury Fields. When the cowed City advanced the money, chose Monk as the major-general of their forces, and invited the Council of State and the general to reside in London, for their greater safety, it is expressly mentioned that he returned thanks without accepting the offer. If Monk ever resided in Hanover Yard, it must have been after the Restoration.      This may have been, as has been suggested by some, the house of Dr. William Bulleyn, that learned   physician whom   we have mentioned in our chapter on St. Giles's, Cripplegate. 
<P>In Sweedon's Passage, Grub Street, Mr. Smith also discovered an extremely old house, which, according to tradition, had been inhabited by both Whittington and Gresham.   It was part of <num value="6">six</num> houses which had occupied the site of an older mansion. The lower portions of the chimneys were of stone, the timber was oak and chestnut, and the ceilings were ornamented.   There was a descent of <num value="3">three</num>   feet into the parlour from   the   outer street.   This house possessed a great curiosityan   external staircase, which stood out like a rickety   tower of timber and plaster, and was covered with a slanting projecting wooden roof. In   an   adjacent house   was an   oriel window, and in the street there ran a long line of lattices, once covered with the relics of a ruined penthouse. 
<P>Coleman   Street, near London   Wall, was so called, says Stow, vaguely, of <QUOTE>Coleman, the <num value="1">first</num> builder and owner thereof,</QUOTE> and had the honour to give a name to <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="26">twenty-six</num> wards of the City of London.   From the trial of Hugh Peters, after the Restoration, we gather that the <QUOTE>Star,</QUOTE> in Coleman Street, was a place of meeting for Oliver Cromwell and several of his party, in <datestruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct>, when Charles I. was in the hands of the Parliament.

<P>The street had been a loyal street to the Puritan party, for it was here that, in <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>, the <num value="5">five</num> members accused of treason by Charles I. took refuge, when he rashly attempted to arrest them in Parliament. 
<P> <QUOTE>And that people might not believe,</QUOTE> says Lord Clarendon, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>that there was any dejection of mind or sorrow, for what was done, the same night the same council caused a proclamation to be prepared for the stopping the ports, that the accused persons might not escape out of the kingdom, and to forbid all persons to receive and harbour them, when it was well known that they were all together in a house in the City, without any fear of their security. And all this was done without the least communication with anybody but the Lord Digby, who advised it; and it is very true, was so willing to take the utmost hazard upon himself, that he did offer the king, when he knew in what house they were together, with a select company of gentlemen who would accompany him, whereof Sir Thomas Lunsford was <num value="1">one</num>, to seize upon them and bring them away alive, or leave them dead in the place; but the king liked not such enterprises. 
<P>That night the persons accused removed themselves into their stronghold, the City; not that they durst not venture themselves at their old lodgings, for no man would have presumed to trouble them, but that the City might see that they relied upon that place for a sanctuary of their privileges against violence and oppression, and so might put on an early concernment for them. And they were not disappointed; for, in spite of all the Lord Mayor could do to compose their distempers (who like a very wise and stout magistrate bestirred himself), the City was that whole night in arms, some people designed to that purpose running from <num value="1">one</num> gate to another, and crying out  <Q>that the Cavaliers were coming to fire the City,</Q>  and some saying that  <Q>the king himself was in the head of them.</Q>  
<P>The next morning Charles himself came in search of the <num value="5">five</num> members. He told <num value="1">one</num> of the sheriffs (who was of the <num value="2">two</num> thought less inclined to his service) that he would dine with him. He then departed without that applause and cheerfulness which he might have expected from the <pb id="P.244" n="244"> extraordinary grace he vouchsafed to them; and in his passage, through the City, the rude people flocked together, crying out,    <Q>Privilege of Parliament! privilege of Parliament!</Q>  some of them   pressing very near his own coach, and amongst the rest <num value="1">one</num> calling out with a very loud voice,  <Q>To your tents, O Israel!</Q>  However, the king, though much mortified, continued his resolution, taking little notice of the distempers; and, having dined at the sheriff's, returned in the afternoon to Whitehall, and published the next day a proclamation for the apprehension of all those whom he accused of high treason, forbidding any person to harbour them, the articles of their charge being likewise printed and dispersed.</QUOTE>

The poet's father was a poor tailor in Suffolk, and his mother kept a little school in which her own children were the chief pupils. Being too delicate to follow the plough, Bloomfield was sent to London to his elder brother George, to learn shoemaking.   There, penned up in a garret with <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> other lads, who paid a shilling each for their lodging, Bloomfield wrote <title>The Farmer's Boy,</title> of which, in <num value="3">three</num> years, <num value="26000">26,000</num> copies were sold, besides French, German, Italian, and Latin translations.

He it was who had intruded himself on the king the day before his execution, and offered to pray with him.   The king thanked him, but said he had chosen Dr. Juxon, whom he knew.

The Bastard, finding the south side unapproachable, then assailed the east of London, and attacked Aldgate with <num value="5000">5,000</num> turbulent men; but the citizens, letting the portcullis drop, entrapped and cut off many of their assailants. Elated by this, Robert Bassett, the alderman of Aldgate, ordered the portcullis to be drawn up, in God's name, and, by a brave sortie, drove the enemy back as far as St. Botolph's. At this juncture, Earl Rivers and the Constable of the Tower arriving with reinforcements, drove the rebels back as far as Mile End, Poplar, and Stratford. Many of the assailants of Aldgate were slain in this attack, after which the Bastard fled. 
<P>Near this gate, in the reign of Edward I., in a small projecting turret, was a hermitage. Without Aldgate was a conduit, erected in <datestruct value="1535--"><year reg="1535">1535</year></datestruct>. The water was conveyed from Hackney. The crowd of poor water-bearers, with their tubs, pails, and tankards, proving, however, a nuisance, the conduit was removed into a side court.

In the year <datestruct value="1760"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>, when the City gates were taken down to widen the streets, Aldgate was bought by Mr. Mussell, of Bethnal Green, a zealous antiquary, who inhabited a house belonging to Lord Viscount Wentworth, built in the reign of James II. Mr. Mussell rebuilt <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.248.5">the gate</LEMMA>
 on the north side of his mansion, to which he henceforth gave the name of Aldgate House. There was a bas-relief on the south front, carved from Wat Tyler's tree, an old oak which once grew on Bow Common, and which the aldermen and council had had carved to adorn the old City gate, A year ago, as workmen were excavating near Aldgate Pump, some very curious arches, resembling the cloisters of an ancient abbey, were discovered.

Sir Thomas, wishing to rebuild St. Catherine Cree, offered the parish the priory church and its <num value="9">nine</num> bells in exchange for their own. The parish refusing to purchase, Sir Thomas offered the church and steeple to any <num value="1">one</num> who would cart it off, but in vain. He then pulled it down anyhow, breaking half the stones, and sold the bells to Stepney parish and St. Stephen, Coleman Street. The Duke of Norfolk, marrying Sir Thomas's daughter, inherited the estate. The Earl of Suffolk, son of the duke who was beheaded, sold the priory precinct and the mansion-house of his mother to the City.   In the year <datestruct value="1622"><year reg="1622">1622</year></datestruct> the inhabitants of Duke's Place, having a quarrel with the parishioners of St. Catherine, obtained leave from King Charles to rebuild the priory church, aided by the donations of Lord Mayor Barkham.

In <datestruct value="1650--"><year reg="1650">1650</year></datestruct>, when they were allowed by Cromwell, in his tolerant wisdom, to return to England, many Jews settled in Duke's Place, where, after the Restoration, they still more flourished.

The Portuguese did not allow the Germans to have any share in the management of congregational affairs.

By the last testament of Sir John, his <num value="13">thirteen</num> bedesmen from the adjoining almshouses were required to come daily to the church and hear mass said or sung near the tomb of their benefactor, at <num value="8">eight</num> a.m., at Our Lady's altar in the middle aisle; and before the said mass the <num value="13">thirteen</num> bedesmen, <num value="1">one</num> of them standing right over against the other and encompassing the tomb, were severally, <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="2">two</num> of them together, to say the <QUOTE>De Profundis,</QUOTE> and a paternoster, ave, and creed, with the collect thereunto belonging; and those who could not say the <QUOTE>De Profundis</QUOTE> were required to say a paternoster, ave, and creed for the souls of Sir John and Dame Johan, and Margaret, Sir John's <num value="1">first</num> wife, and the souls of their fathers, mothers, children, and friends, and for <QUOTE>all Christian souls.</QUOTE> A good and comprehensive benediction, it cannot be denied. 
<P>The inmates of the Drapers' Almshouses received <measure value="2s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> a month, the <num value="1">first</num> day of every month, for ever. The bedesmen were to be of honest conversation, and not detected in any open crime. They were forbidden to sell ale, beer, or wine, <QUOTE>or any other thing concerning tippling.</QUOTE> Over the gate of Milborne's Almshouses, says Strype, there was <QUOTE>a <num value="4">four</num>-square stone, with the figure of the Assumption of our Blessed Lady, supported by <num value="6">six</num> angels in a cloud of glory.</QUOTE> Sir Richard Champion, mayor and draper, in Elizabeth's reign, gave <measure value="19l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="19">19</num></measure> <measure value="14s." type=currency><num value="14">14</num>s.</measure> a year to these same bedesmen. He also desired that every Sunday <num value="13">thirteen</num> penny loaves of white bread should be given to <num value="13">thirteen</num> poor people at the churches of St. Edmund, Lombard Street, and St. Michael's, Cornhill. He also gave the poor of each parish <num value="1">one</num> load of charcoal (<num value="30">thirty</num> sacks) every year; and to carry out these bequests, he left the Drapers' Company twentythree messuages and eighteen garden-plots in the parish of St. Olave's, Hart Street. But Anthony Munday denies these last bequests, and thinks that Stow unintentionally slandered the Drapers' Company, by asserting that the terms of the will had not been carried out. Lord Lumley's house, built by Sir Thomas Wyat, in the reign of Henry VIII., adjoined these almshouses, and not far off was the house of the prior of Horn Church, in Essex, Northumberland House; and Poor Jewry, a small district of Jews. <pb id="P.251" n="251">

<P>No satisfactory etymology of the word <QUOTE>Islington</QUOTE> has yet been given. By some writers the name is supposed to have been derived from the Saxon word <hi rend=italics>isen</hi> (iron), from certain springs, impregnated with iron, supposed to have their rise in the neighbourhood. Others trace it to the Saxon word <hi rend=italics>eisel</hi> (a hostage), without ever condescending to explain what hostages had to do with Islington. The more favoured supposition is that the village was originally called <QUOTE>Ishel,</QUOTE> an old British word signifying <QUOTE>lower,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>dun,</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>don,</QUOTE> the usual term for a town or fortress.   It might have been so called, Mr. Lewis thinks, to contrast it with Tolentone, a village built on the elevated ground adjoining the woods of Highbury. The germ of the Islington of the Britons, it is generally allowed, must have been along the east side of the Lower Street. 
<P>Islington is supposed to have been situated on the great northern Roman road called the Ermin, or Herman Street, which left London by Cripplegate, and passed through Islington, though, as some antiquaries think, the Roman road really intersected Old Street, and, crossing the City Road, passed by Highbury and Hornsey Wood, and continued by way of the green lanes towards Enfield. 
<P>Fitzstephen, the friend of Becket, writing between <datestruct value="1170--"><year reg="1170">1170</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1182--"><year reg="1182">1182</year></datestruct>, speaking of the north of London, says, <QUOTE>On the north are fields for pastures, and open meadows, very pleasant, into which the river waters do flow, and mills are turned about with a delightful noise. The arable lands are no hungry pieces of gravel ground, but like the rich fields of Asia, which bring plentiful corn, and fill the barns of the owners with a dainty crop of the fruits of Ceres.</QUOTE> Still <QUOTE>beyond them an immense forest extends itself, beautified with woods and groves, and full of the lairs and coverts of beasts and game, stags, bucks, boars, and wild bulls.</QUOTE> In later centuries Islington became the pasture-ground of London. 
<P>The old highways and roads connected with Islington were very badly kept, and extremely incommodious. Formerly <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.251.3">the avenues leading to the village from the metropolis</LEMMA>, exclusive of the footpaths over the fields, were confined to the road from Smithfield, through St. John Street; the Goswell Street road, from Aldersgate; and a bridle way that had once been an old Roman road: all these were frequently impassable in winter. The broad green fields that stretched from Finsbury to Hoxton and Islington seem to have been recognised as the Campus Martius of London as early as the reign of Henry II., for Fitzstephen describes, with more unction than an ascetic monk might be expected to manifest, the scholars of the City going to the northern fields with their teachers, to play at ball, while the old and wealthy citizens came on horseback to watch the merry conflict of the lads. He also mentions the military exercises on horseback, good training for war or the tournament, every Friday in Lent; while other citizens, more intent on their own amusement, he says, carried their hawks on their fists, or took out their dogs there, to have a turn or <num value="2">two</num> after a hare. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.251.4">Archery was early practised in these pleasant northern fields</LEMMA>,   and   here men shot the shafts that were hereafter to be aimed at Frenchmen's hearts. As early as the reign of Edward III. the royal will was proclaimed that every able-bodied citizen was, in his leisure hours and on all holidays, to practise with bows or crossbows, and not to waste his time in throwing stones, or at football, handball, bandy, or cock-fighting, which were vain and profitless plays; while in the reign of Richard II. an Act was passed to oblige all men-servants to exercise themselves with bows and arrows at all times or leisure, and on all Sundays and holidays. 
<P>In the reign of Henry VIII., that manly and warlike king, who was himself an archer, several Acts were passed to promote the practice of archery. Every father was enjoined to provide a bow and <num value="2">two</num> arrows for his son, when he reached his <num value="7">seventh</num> year; and all persons, except the clergy and judges, were obliged to shoot periodically at the butts, which were nowhere more numerous than in the fields towards Islington. <num value="3">Three</num> gentlemen of the Court were constituted overseers of the science of artillery--to wit, of longbows, crossbows, and handguns-and leave was given them, as a body <pb id="P.252" n="252"> corporate, to practice shooting at all manner of marks and butts, and at fowls, and the game of the popinjay in the City and suburbs, and all other places.   And when any member of this society, shooting at well-known and accustomed marks, and used the usual caution-word of archers, <QUOTE>Fast,</QUOTE> they could not be impeached or troubled by the relations of any passer-by slain at misadventure. It was in these fields the king's favourite archer, Barlow, christened by him <QUOTE>the Duke of Shoreditch,</QUOTE> and the Marquis of Islington and the Earl of Pancras, his skilful companions, made their cleverest hits, and in Hoxton Fields took place that great procession of the Duke of Shoreditch and his <num value="3000">3,000</num> archers and <num value="200">200</num> torch-bearers. In the reign of Henry VIII., 
<FIGURE id="Fig.252" n="2000.07.0095"><HEAD>The Old <QUOTE>Fountain,</QUOTE> In The Minories.   (From A View By N. Smith, <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 says the chronicler Hall, the young men of London, finding the fields about Islington, Hoxton, and Shoreditch getting more and more enclosed with hedges and ditches, and that neither the old men could walk for their pleasure, nor lads shoot without getting their bows and arrows taken away or broken, a riot arose. <num value="1">One</num> morning a turner, dressed as a jester, led a mob through the City shouting <QUOTE>Shovels and spades! shovels and spades!</QUOTE> So many of the people followed, that it was a wonder to behold; and within a short space all the hedges about the City were cast down and the ditches filled up. The rioters then quietly dispersed. <QUOTE>After which,</QUOTE> Hall says, with gusto, <QUOTE>those fields were never hedged.</QUOTE> 
<P>In the reign of Elizabeth archery seems to have <pb id="P.253" n="253"> been on the decline, though good old Stow describes the citizens as still frequenting the northern fields, <QUOTE>to walk, shoot, and otherwise recreate and refresh their dulled spirits in the sweet and wholesome air,</QUOTE> and mentions that of old it was the custom for the officers of the City-namely, the sheriffs, the porters of the Weigh House, and all others--to be challengers of all men in the suburbs to wrestle, <QUOTE>shoot the standard, broad arrow and flight,</QUOTE> for games, at Clerkenwell and in Finsbury Fields. In <datestruct value="1570--"><year reg="1570">1570</year></datestruct>, however, we find the London bowyers, fletchers, stringers, and arrow-head makers petitioning the Lord   Treasurer concerning their decayed condition, by reason of the discontinuance of archery, and the practice of unlawful games; and from 
<FIGURE id="Fig.253" n="2000.07.0096"><HEAD>The Old <QUOTE>Queen's Head</QUOTE> Tavern.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 Stow we gather that the increased enclosures had driven the archers into bowling-alleys and gamblinghouses. 
<P>James I., in <datestruct value="1605--"><year reg="1605">1605</year></datestruct>, finding archery still on the decline, though many of his best soldiers preferred bows to guns, still issued letters patent to several distinguished persons, and among them to Sir Thomas Fowler, of Islington, to survey all the open grounds within <num value="2">two</num> miles of the. City, and to see that they were put in proper order for the exercise of the City, as in the reign of Henry VIII. Charles I. published a similar edict, ordering all mounds to be lowered that obstructed the archers' view from <measure value="1bmark" type=currency><num value="1">one</num> mark</measure> to another. There were indeed at this time, or a little later, no less than <measure value="160bmark" type=currency><num value="160">160</num> marks</measure> set up in <pb id="P.254" n="254"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.254.1">Hon. Artillery Company's Ball</LEMMA></NOTE>
 the Finsbury Fields, each duly registered by name. These marks, placed   at varying distances, to accustom   the archers to judge the distance, are all named in a curious old tract, entitled <QUOTE>Ayme for Finsbury Archers,</QUOTE> published at the <QUOTE>Swan</QUOTE> in Grub Street, in <datestruct value="1594--"><year reg="1594">1594</year></datestruct>, and several times reprinted. Among them we find the following quaint titles, suggestive of old nicknames, lucky shots, and bow. men's jokes:--Sir Rowland, Lurching, Nelson, Martin's Mayflower, Dunstan's Darling, Beswick's Stake, Lambert's Goodwill, Lee's Leopard, Thief in the Hedge, Mildmay's Rose, Silkworm, Lee's Lion. Goodly shots, no doubt, these marks had recorded, and pleasant halts they had been for the Finsbury bowmen of old time. 
<P>The dainty archers of the present day can scarcely believe the strength of the old yew bows, or the length of the arrows, and are apt to be incredulous of the pith of their ancestors' shafts. Nevertheless, the statute of the <num value="33">thirty-third</num> year of Henry VIII. distinctly lays down that men of the age of <num value="24">twenty-four</num> were prohibited from shooting at any mark under <num value="220">two hundred and twenty</num> yards; and the longest distance of that stalwart epoch seems to have been <num value="19">nineteen</num>   score, or <num value="380">three hundred and eighty</num> yards. 
<P>During the Cromwell time archery seems to have been deemed unpractical, and was not much enforced.   The old ways, however, revived with Charles II., and in <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct> there was a great cavalcade to the Finsbury Fields, at which the king himself was present, and the old titles of the Duke of Shoreditch and Marquis of Islington were bestowed on the best shots. On a Finsbury archer's ticket for: the shooting of <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>, all lovers of archery are invited to meet at Drapers' Hall, in Throgmorton Street; and   it is noted that the <num value="11">eleven</num> score targets would be set up in the new Artillery Ground. It was in this year that the great archer, <QUOTE>Sir</QUOTE> William Wood, was presented with a silver badge. This stout bowman was eventually buried in Clerkenwell Church, with archers' honours. Sir William Davenant, in his playful poem   of <QUOTE>The Long Vacation in London,</QUOTE> describes the attorneys shoot-. ing against the proctors, and thus sketches the citizen archer of those days- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Each with solemn oath agree 
<L>To meet in fields of Finsburie; 
<L>With loynes in canvas bow-case tyde, 
<L>Where arrows stick with mickle pride; 
<L>With hats pin'd up, and bow in hand, 
<L>All day most fiercely there they stand, 
<L>Like ghosts of ADAM BELL and <hi rend=italics>Clymme,</hi>
 
<L>Sol sets, for fear they'll shoot at him.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Up to the last edition of the Map of Archers' Marks in <datestruct value="1738--"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>, the fields from Peerless Pool to northward of the <QUOTE>Rosemary Branch</QUOTE> are studded with <QUOTE>roving</QUOTE> marks, generally wooden pillars, crowned by some emblem, such as a bird or a circle. The last great meeting of Islington archers was in <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>, at Blackheath, when the archers' company of the Honourable Artillery Company contended with the Surrey and Kentish bowmen, the Hainault Foresters, the Woodmen of Arden, the Robin Hood Society, &amp;c. Several times in the last century the Artillery Company asserted their old archer privileges, and replaced the marks which had been removed by encroachers.. In <datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct> they forced the gate of a large, field in which stood <num value="1">one</num> of their stone marks, close to Balls Pond; and in <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct> they ordered obstructions to be removed between Peerless Pool, <hi rend=italics>south</hi>, Baume's Pond, <hi rend=italics>north,</hi>
 Hoxton, <hi rend=italics>east</hi>, and Islington, <hi rend=italics>west</hi>. In the same year they threatened to pull down part <hi rend=italics>ot</hi> a wall erected by the. proprietors of a white-lead mill, between the marks of <hi rend=italics>Bob Peak</hi> and the <hi rend=italics>Levant.</hi>
 <num value="1">One</num> of the partners of the works, however, induced them to desist; but a member of the archers' division shot an arrow over the enclosure, to assert the Company's right. In <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>, when the long butts at Islington Common were destroyed by gravel-diggers, the Artillery Company also required the marks to be replaced. In <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>, of all the old open ground there only remained a few acres to the north of the City Road. 
<P>An old public-house fronting the fields at Hoxton, and called the <QUOTE>Robin Hood,</QUOTE> was still existing in Nelson's time (<datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>). It had been a great place of resort for the Finsbury archers, and under the sign was the following inscription:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Ye archers bold and yeomen good, 
<L>Stop and drink with Robin Hood; 
<L>If Robin Hood is not at home, 
<L>Stop and drink with Little John.</QUOTE>
 
<P>There is a traditional story that Topham, the strong man of Islington, was once challenged by some Finsbury archers whom he had ridiculed to draw an arrow <num value="2">two</num>-thirds of its length. The bet was a bowl of punch; bit- Topham, though he drew the shaft towards his breast, instead of his ear, after many fruitless efforts, lost the wager. 
<P>The historical recollections of Islington are not numerous. <num value="1">One</num> of the earliest is connected with the visit of Llewellyn and his Welsh barons, who in the reign of Edward I. came to London to pay homage to the king. They were quartered at Islington, but they disliked our wine, ale, and bread, and could not obtain milk enough. More. over, their Welsh pride was disgusted at being so stared at by the Londoners, on account of their uncommon dress. <QUOTE>We will never visit Islington <pb id="P.255" n="255"> again except as conquerors,</QUOTE> they cried, and from that instant resolved to take up arms. In <datestruct value="1465--"><year reg="1465">1465</year></datestruct>, Henry VI., who had been captured in Lancashire, was brought to London with his legs bound to his horse's stirrups. At Islington he was met by his great enemy, the Earl of Warwick, who removed his gilt spurs contemptuously, and hurried him to the Tower. Edward IV., on the occasion of his accession to the throne, was welcomed between Islington and Shoreditch by the Lord Mayor and aldermen of London, some of whom   he knighted. In the same manner the crafty King Henry VII., on his return from the overthrow of Lambert Simnel, was met in Hornsey Park by the mayor, aldermen, sheriffs, and principal commoners, all on horseback in <num value="1">one</num> livery, when he dubbed the mayor, Sir William Horn, knight, and between Islington and London knighted Alderman Sir John Percivall. 
<P>Henry VIII. frequently visited Islington, to call on noblemen of his court, for Dudley, Earl of Warwick, held the manor of Stoke Newington; and Algernon Percy, Earl of Northumberland, occupied a mansion on Newington Green. From this house we find the earl writing in an alarmed way to Secretary Cromwell, vowing that he had never proposed marriage to Anne Boleyn.   The earl, who died the year after, is supposed to have left the house in which he lived, and <num value="1">one</num> on the south side of Newington Green, to the king, who resided for some time in the <num value="1">first</num>, and employed   the other for the use of his household. From this country palace of Henry VIII. a pathway leading from the corner of Newington Green, to the turnpike road at Ball's Pond, became known as <QUOTE>King Harry's Walk.</QUOTE> Game was plentiful about Islington, and by a proclamation dated <datestruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct> the king prohibited all hunting and hawking of hares, partridges, pheasants, and heron, from <QUOTE>Westminster to St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and from thence to Islington, to Our Lady of the Oak,. to Highgate, to Hornsey Park, and to Hampstead Heath.</QUOTE> 
<P>In <datestruct value="1557--"><year reg="1557">1557</year></datestruct>, during Queen Mary's hunting down of Protestants, a small congregation of Reformers, who had assembled at the <QUOTE>Saracen's Head,</QUOTE> Islington, under pretext of attending a play, were betrayed by a treacherous tailor, arrested by the Queen's vice-chamberlain, and thrown into prison.   The most eminent of-these persecuted men was John Rough, who had been a preacher among the Black Friars at Stirling, chaplain to the Earl of Arran, and the means of persuading John Knox to enter the ministry. He was burnt at the stake at Smithfield, and <num value="4">four</num> of the others perished praising God in <num value="1">one</num> fire at Islington.   But there is the old saying, <QUOTE>The blood of martyrs is the seed of the Church.</QUOTE> Only the next year <datestruct value="40"><year reg="40">forty</year></datestruct> <QUOTE>godly and innocent persons,</QUOTE> who, had assembled in <QUOTE>a back close in the field by the town of Islington</QUOTE> to pray and meditate, were apprehended by the constables, bowmen, and billmen. All but <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> escaped, and of these <num value="22">twenty-two</num> lay in Newgate <num value="7">seven</num> weeks before they were- examined, though offered pardon if they would consent to hear a mass. <QUOTE>Eventually,</QUOTE> says Foxe, in his <title>Acts and Monuments,</title> <QUOTE><num value="7">seven</num> were burnt in Smithfield and <num value="6">six</num> at Brentford.</QUOTE> 
<P>Queen Elizabeth seems to have been partial to Islington, paying frequent visits to Sir Thomas Fowler and to Sir John Spencer of Canonbury House.   In <datestruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct>   she made a grand tour of the east of London which took several days. From the Tower she <num value="1">first</num> visited Houndsditch and Spitalfields, thence went through the fields to Charterhouse, and in a few days continued her route back to the Savoy and thence to Enfield. On her return to St. James's as she passed through Islington, hedges were cut down and ditches filled up to quicken her progress across the fields. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1581--"><year reg="1581">1581</year></datestruct>, the queen, riding by Aldersgate Bars towards the Islington Fields   to take the air, was environed by a crowd of sturdy beggars, which gave the queen much disturbance. That same evening Fleetwood, the Recorder, had the fields scoured, and apprehended <num value="74">seventy-four</num> rogues, some blind, <QUOTE>yet great usurers, and very rich.</QUOTE> The strongest of the <num value="74">seventy-four</num> <QUOTE>they bestowed in the milne and the lighters.</QUOTE> 
<P>In the great entertainment given at Kenilworth by the Earl of Leicester to Queen Elizabeth in <datestruct value="1575--"><year reg="1575">1575</year></datestruct>, a minstrel discoursed with tiresome minuteness on the Islington dairies, that supplied London bridal parties with furmenty, not over-sodden, for porridge, unchalked milk for <QUOTE>flawnery,</QUOTE> unadulterated cream for custards, and pure fresh butter for pasties. The arms of Islington, it was proposed, should be <num value="3">three</num> milk tankards proper on a field of clouted cream, <num value="3">three</num> green cheeses upon a shelf of cake bread, a. furmenty bowl, stuck with horn spoons, and, for supporters, a grey mare (used to carry the milk tankards) and her silly foal; the motto, <QUOTE lang=la>Lac caseus infans,</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>Fresh cheese and cream,</QUOTE> the milkwives cry in London streets. 
<P>The ill-starred Earl of Essex, on his way to Ireland, where he was to sweep away rebellion by a wave of his hand, passed through Islington with his gay and hopeful train of noblemen and gentlemen, returning only to become himself a rebel, and to end his days on the Tower Hill block. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></datestruct>, when James I., with all his hungry Scotch courtiers, rode into London, he was met at Stamford Hill by the Lord Mayor, aldermen, <pb id="P.256" n="256"> and <num value="500">500</num> of the principal citizens, who escorted him through the Islington Fields to the Charterhouse.   He passed along the Upper Street, which was for a short time after known as King Street. 
<P>Charles I., on his return from Scotland in <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, passed through   Islington, accompanied by his queen, the Prince of Wales, and the Duke of York. In the following year the Committee of the London Militia gave orders to fortify the approaches to the City, and in <datestruct value="1643--"><year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct> the entrenchment began in earnest, the Trained Band citizens, and even their wives and children, toiling at the work. The trades volunteered by turns.   <num value="1">One</num> day there were <num value="5000">5,000</num> felt-makers and cappers, and nearly <num value="3000">3,000</num> porters; another day, <num value="4000">4,000</num> or <num value="5000">5,000</num> shoemakers; and a <num value="3">third</num> day, <num value="6000">6,000</num> tailors. Several of the works were in the neighbourhood of Islington. There was a, breastwork and battery at Mount Mill, in the Goswell Street Road, another at the end of St. John Street, a large fort, with <num value="4">four</num> half bulwarks, at the New River Upper Pond, and a small redoubt near Islington Pound. 
<P>When the great plot to assassinate Cromwell was detected, in <datestruct value="1653--"><year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>, Vowell, an Islington schoolmaster, <num value="1">one</num> of the plotters, was hung at Charing Cross. He died bravely, crying out for Church, King, and Restoration, and warning the soldiers of their dangerous principles.   Colonel Okey, whom Cromwell compelled to sit as <num value="1">one</num> of King Charles's judges, was in early life a drayman and stoker at an Islington brewery. He was seized in Holland, after the Restoration, and executed in <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>.   A curious story is told of the famous Parliamentary   general, Skippon, in   connection with Islington. This tough old soldier was being brought from   Naseby, where he had been desperately wounded. As his horse litter was passing through Islington, a mastiff sprang at <num value="1">one</num> of the horses, and worried him, nor would he let go till a soldier ran him through with his sword. Skippon, however, on getting to London, had a piece of his waistcoat drawn from his bullet-wound, and soon recovered. 
<P>For many ages Islington, especially in summer, was a favourite resort for London citizens, who delighted to saunter there to drink creams and eat cakes, or to hunt the ducks of the suburban ponds with their water-dogs. As early as <datestruct value="1628"><year reg="1628">1628</year></datestruct>, George Wither, the poet, in his <title>Britannia's Remembrances,</title>
 describing holiday-making, says-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Some by the banks of Thames their pleasure taking

<P>Cromwell is said to have resided in a house (afterwards the <QUOTE>Crown</QUOTE> public house) on the north side of the road at Upper Holloway, but there is no proof of the fact. He probably, however, often visited Islington to call on his friend Sir Arthur Haselrigge, colonel of a regiment of cuirassiers, called the <QUOTE>Lobster</QUOTE> regiment, who had a house there. In <datestruct VALUE="1664-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1664">1664</year></datestruct>-<num value="5">5</num>, Sir Arthur complained to Parliament that as he was riding from the House of Commons in the road leading from Perpoole Lane to Clerkenwell, returning to his house at Islington, the Earl of Stamford and his <num value="2">two</num> servants had struck at him with a drawn sword and <QUOTE>other offensive instruments,</QUOTE> upon which he was enjoined to keep the peace, and neither send nor receive any challenge. 
<P>In later times Islington still remained renowned for its tea-gardens and places of rustic amusement, and in the <hi rend=italics>Spleen</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>Islington Spa</hi>, a comic piece, written by George Colman, and acted at Drury Lane in <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>, the author sketches pleasantly enough the bustle occasioned by a citizen's family preparing to start for their country house at Islington.

<P>Danger lent a certain dignity to these excursions. In <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct> the roads and footpaths of Islington seem to have been infested by highwaymen and footpads, the hornets and mosquitoes of those days. In the year above mentioned, the Islington Vestry agreed to pay a reward of <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure>   to any person who apprehended a robber.     It was customary at this time for persons walking from the City to Islington after dark to wait at the end of St. John Street till a sufficient number had collected, and then to be escorted by an armed patrol.   Even in <datestruct value="1742--"><year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct> the 
<title>London Magazine</title> observed that scarcely a night passed without some <num value="1">one</num> being robbed between the <QUOTE>Turk's Head,</QUOTE> near Wood's Close, Islington, and the road leading to Goswell Street. In <datestruct value="1771--"><year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct> the inhabitants of Islington subscribed   a sum of money for rewarding   persons apprehending robbers, as many dwellings had been broken open, and the Islington stage was frequently stopped. In <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, in consequence of riots and depredations, the inhabitants furnished themselves with arms and equipments, and formed a military society for <pb id="P.258" n="258"> general protection. In spite of this, robberies and murders in the by-roads, constantly took place.

<P>In <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, the old fears of French invasion again filling the minds of citizens, a volunteer corps of infantry was organised at Islington.

<P>Nelson, writing in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, explains the great disproportion that there appeared in the Islington parish registers between the burials and baptisms, from the fact of the great number of invalids who resorted to a district then often called <QUOTE>The London Hospital.</QUOTE> Dr. Hunter used to relate a story of a lady, who, in an advanced age, and declining state of health, went, by the advice of her physician, to take lodgings in Islington. She agreed for a suite of rooms, and, coming down stairs, observed that the banisters were much out of repair. <QUOTE>These,</QUOTE> she said, <QUOTE>must be mended before she could think of coming to live there.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Madam,</QUOTE> replied the landlady, <QUOTE>that will answer no purpose, as the undertaker's men, in bringing down the coffins, are continually breaking the banisters.</QUOTE> The old lady was so shocked at this funereal intelligence, that she immediately declined occupying the apartments. 
<P>The most interesting hostelry in old Islington was   <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.260.1">the old <QUOTE>Queen's Head,</QUOTE> </LEMMA> at the corner of Queen's Head Lane.   It was pulled down, to the regret of all antiquaries, in <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>. 
<P> <QUOTE>It was,</QUOTE> says Lewis, <QUOTE>a strong wood and plaister building of <num value="3">three</num> lofty storeys, projecting over each other in front, and forming bay windows, supported by brackets and carved figures. The centre, which projected several feet beyond the other part of the building, and formed a commodious porch, to which there was a descent of several steps, was supported in front by caryatides of carved oak, standing on either side of the entrance, and crowned with Ionic scrolls.   The house is said to have been once entered by an 
<hi rend=italics>ascent</hi> of several steps, but, at the time it was pulled down, the floor of its front parlour was <num value="4">four</num> feet below the level of the highway; and this alteration is easily accounted for, when the antiquity of the building, the vast accumulation of matter upon the road, in the course of many centuries, and the fact of an arch having been thrown over the New River, in front of the house, are considered.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>The interior of the house was constructed in a similar manner to that of most of the old buildings in the parish, having oak-panelled wainscots and stuccoed ceilings. The principal room was the parlour already alluded to, the ceiling of which was ornamented with dolphins, cherubs, acorns, &amp;c., surrounded by a wreathed border of fruit and foliage, and had, near the centre, a medallion, of a character apparently Roman, crowned with bays, and a small shield containing the initials   <Q>I. M.</Q>  surrounded by cherubim and glory. The chimneypiece was supported by <num value="2">two</num> figures carved in stone, hung with festoons, &amp;c., and the stone slab, immediately over the fireplace, exhibited the stories of Danae and Actaeon in relief, with mutilated figures of Venus, Bacchus, and Plenty.</QUOTE> 
<P>Tradition had long connected <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.260.2">this house</LEMMA> with the name of Sir Walter Raleigh, though with no sufficient reason. In the thirtieth year of Elizabeth, Sir Walter obtained a patent <QUOTE>to make licences for keeping of taverns and retailing of wines throughout England.</QUOTE> This house may be <num value="1">one</num> of those to which Raleigh granted licences, and the sign then marked the reign in which it was granted.   There is also a tradition that Lord Treasurer Burleigh once resided here, and a topographical writer mentions the fact that <num value="2">two</num> lions carved in wood, the supporters of the Cecil arms, formerly stood in an adjoining yard, and appeared to have once belonged to the old <QUOTE>Queen's Head.</QUOTE> Another story is that Queen Elizabeth's saddler resided here; while others assert that it was the summer residence of the Earl of Essex, and the resort of Elizabeth. Early in the last century, this occasional house belonged to a family named Roome, <num value="1">one</num> of whom   left the estate to Lady Edwards. The oak parlour of the old building was preserved in the new <num value="1">one</num>. In a house adjoining the <QUOTE>Queen's Head</QUOTE> resided John Rivington, the well-known bookseller, who died in <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Behind Frederick Place we reach the site of the old <QUOTE>Pied Bull</QUOTE> Inn, pulled down about <num value="45">forty-five</num> years ago, which was originally either the property or the residence of Sir Walter Raleigh. In the parlour window, looking into the garden, was some curious stained glass, containing the arms of Sir John Miller, Knight, of Islington and Devon. These arms bear date <num value="8">eight</num> years after Sir Walter was beheaded, and were, it is supposed, substituted by Miller when he came to reside here. The seahorses, parrots in the window, and the leaves, <pb id="P.261" n="261"> supposed to represent tobacco, seem to have been chosen as emblems of his career by Raleigh himself. 
<P> <QUOTE>The arms in the parlour window,</QUOTE> says Nelson, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>are enclosed within an ornamental border, consisting of <num value="2">two</num> mermaids, each crested with a globe, as many sea-horses supporting a bunch of green leaves over the shield, and the lower part contains a green and a grey parrot, the former eating fruit. Adjoining to this is another compartment in the window, representing a green parrot perched on a wreath, under a pediment, within a border of figures and flowers, but which does not seem to have been intended for any armorial ensign. 
<P>The chimney-piece of this room   contains the figures of Faith, Hope, and Charity, with their usual insignia, in niches, surrounded by a border of cherubim, fruit, and foliage. The centre figure, Charity, is surmounted by <num value="2">two</num> Cupids supporting a crown, and beneath is a lion and unicorn couchant. This conceit was probably designed by the artist in compliment to the reigning princess, Queen Elizabeth.   The ceiling displays a personification of the <num value="5">Five</num> Senses in stucco, with Latin mottoes underneath, as follows:--An oval in the centre contains a female figure holding a serpent, which is twining round her right arm, and biting the hand; her left hand holds a stick, the point of which rests on the back of a toad at her feet. The motto to this is  <Q>Tactus.</Q>  Around the above, in smaller ovals, are, a female bearing fruit under her left arm, of which she is eating, as is also an ape seated at her feet, with the word  <Q>Gustus.</Q>  Another figure holding a vizard. At its feet a cat and a hawk, with the motto,  <Q> Visus.</Q>  A figure playing on the lute, with a stag listening, and the motto,  <Q> Auditus.</Q>  The last figure is standing in a garden, and holding a bouquet of flowers. At her feet is a dog, and the motto,  <Q>Olfactus.</Q> </QUOTE>
 
<P>That corner stone of Islington, the <QUOTE>Angel,</QUOTE> has been now an established inn for considerably more than <num value="200">200</num> years. In old days, it was a great haltingplace for travellers in the <num value="1">first</num> night out of London. <QUOTE>The ancient house,</QUOTE> says Lewis, <QUOTE>which was pulled down in <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct> to make way for the present <num value="1">one</num>, presented the usual features of a large old country inn, having a long front with an overhanging tiled roof, and <num value="2">two</num> rows of windows, <num value="12">twelve</num> in each row, independently of those on the basement storey. The principal entrance was beneath a projection, which extended along a portion of the front, and had a wooden gallery at the top.   The inn-yard, approached by a gateway in the centre, was nearly a quadrangle, having double galleries, supported by plain columns and carved pilasters, with caryatides and other figures.</QUOTE> 
<P>There is a tradition that the whole of the ground from the corner of the Back Road to the <QUOTE>Angel</QUOTE> was forfeited by the parish of Islington, and united to that of Clerkenwell, in consequence of the refusal of the Islingtonians to bury a pauper who was found dead at the corner of the Back Road.

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 
<P>The old parish church of Islington, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was a strange rambling structure, entered through a gable-ended school-room which blocked up the west end. It had an old flint tower, with <num value="6">six</num> bells, a clock, and a sun-dial. The date of the building was not much earlier than <datestruct value="1483--"><year reg="1483">1483</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1751--"><year reg="1751">1751</year></datestruct>, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.261.1">the church becoming ruinous, it was pulled down and rebuilt by Mr. Steemson</LEMMA>, under the direction of Mr. Dowbiggin, <num value="1">one</num> of the unsuccessful competitors for the erection of Blackfriars Bridge. It cost <measure value="7340l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="7340">7,340</num></measure>. In <datestruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></datestruct> the church was repaired and the tower strengthened. 
<P> <QUOTE>Thomas Birch, a basket-maker,</QUOTE> says Nelson, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>undertook, for the sum of <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>, to erect a scaffold, of wicker-work round the spire, and which he formed entirely of willow, hazel, and other sticks. It had a flight of stairs within, ascending in a spiral line from the octagonal balustrade to the vane, by which the ascent was as easy and safe as the stairs of a dwelling-house. This ingenious contrivance entirely superseded the use of a scaffold, which would have been more expensive, and is frequently attended with danger in works of this kind.   The spire on this occasion presented a very curious appearance, being entirely enveloped, as it were, in a huge basket, within which the workmen were <pb id="P.262" n="262"> performing the necessary repairs in perfect safety. The late Alderman Staines is said to have been the <num value="1">first</num> person who contrived this kind of scaffolding, in some repairs done to the spire of St. Bride's Church, London, which was damaged by lightning in the year <datestruct value="1764"><year reg="1764">1764</year></datestruct>, after having his scaffold-poles, &amp;c., which had been erected in the usual way, carried away by a violent storm.</QUOTE>
 
<P>In Islington Church were buried, in <datestruct value="1609--"><year reg="1609">1609</year></datestruct>, Sir George Wharton, son of Lord Wharton, and James Steward, son of Lord Blantyre, and godson of James I. These young gallants quarrelled at the gaming-table, and fought at Islington with sword and dagger, and in their shirts, for fear of either wearing concealed armour. They both fell dead on the field, and, by the king's desire, were buried in <num value="1">one</num> grave. In the church vault are <num value="2">two</num> iron coffins, and <num value="1">one</num> of cedar, the last containing the body of Justice Palmer, train-bearer to Onslow, the Speaker. The object of the cedar was to resist the attack of the worms, and the cover was shaped like the gable roof of a house to prevent any other coffin being put upon it.   Here, also, is buried a great-grandson of the eminent navigator, Magelhaens, and Osborne, the Gray's Inn bookseller, whom   Dr. Johnson knocked down with a folio.   Osborne gave      <num value="13000">13,000</num>   for the Earl of Oxford's library, the binding of which alone had cost <measure value="18000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="18000">18,000</num></measure>.   In <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct> the body of a young woman named Thomas was disinterred here, there being a suspicion that she had been murdered, as a large wire was formerly thrust through her heart. It was, however, found that this had been done by the doctor, at her dying request, to prevent the possibility of her being buried alive. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> of the celebrated buildings of Islington was Fisher House, in the Lower Street, and nearly opposite the east end of Cross Street.   It was probably built about the beginning of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. In the interior the arms of Fowler and Fisher were to be seen.   Ezekiel Tongue, an old writer against the Papists, is supposed to have kept a school here about <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct> for teaching young ladies Greek and Latin. It was afterwards a lodging-house, and then a lunatic asylum. Here Brothers, the prophet, was confined, till Lord Chancellor Erskine liberated him in <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>. 
<P>At the south end of Frog Lane was formerly a public-house called <QUOTE>Frog Hall;</QUOTE> the sign, a plough drawn by frogs.   At the <QUOTE>Barley Mow</QUOTE> publichouse, in Frog Lane, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.262.1">George Morland</LEMMA>,   the painter, resided for several months, about the year <datestruct value="1800"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>. Morland would frequently apply to a farm-house opposite for harness, to sketch, and if he saw a suitable rustic for a model pass by, would induce him to sit, by the offer of money and beer. Here he drank and painted alternately. Close by, at No. <num value="8">8</num>, Popham Terrace, resided that useful old writer, John Thomas Smith (he was a pupil of Nollekens), <QUOTE>Rainy Day Smith,</QUOTE> to whose works on London we have been much indebted. He became Keeper of the Print-Room of the British Museum, and died in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Opposite Rufford's Buildings there stood, till <datestruct value="1812"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, an old Elizabethan house of wood and plaster, with curious ceilings, and a granite mantelpiece representing the Garden of Eden and the Tree of Knowledge. The new house became Shield's school, where Dr. Hawes and John Nicholls, the antiquary, were educated. In a house which formerly stood in the Upper Street, opposite Cross Street, resided Dr. William Pitcairn, elected physician, in <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>, to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. He commenced a botanical garden of <num value="5">five</num> acres behind the house, but it does not now exist. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> of the celebrated houses of old Islington was No. <num value="41">41</num>, Cross Street, and formerly the mansion of the Fowler family, lords of the manor of Barnesbury.   The Fowlers were great people in their swords and ruffs, in the days of Elizabeth and James; and Sir Thomas Fowler appears to have been <num value="1">one</num> of the jurors upon the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh, at Winchester, in <datestruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></datestruct>. The house is wood and plaster, with a modern brick front. It appears to be of the age of Elizabeth. 
<P> <QUOTE>The ceiling of a back room on the <num value="1">first</num> floor,</QUOTE> says Lewis, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>is decorated with the arms of England in the reign of that princess, with her initials, and the date (<datestruct value="1595"><year reg="1595">1595</year></datestruct>) in stucco; also the initials of Thomas and Jane Fowler, T F. with <foreign lang=fr>fleur de lis</foreign>, medallions, &amp;c., in the same style as the ceilings at Canonbury House. The rooms are wainscoted with oak in panels, and till the year <datestruct value="1788"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>, when they were removed, the windows contained some arms in stained glass, among which were those of Fowler, with the date (<datestruct value="1588"><year reg="1588">1588</year></datestruct>), and those of Herne, or Heron.   In pulling down some old houses for the formation of Halton Street, at the east end of this house, some remains of the ancient stabling and offices were taken away.   In these stables a fire broke out on the <datestruct VALUE="1655-02-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1655">1655</year></datestruct>, but it does not appear to have done any injury to the dwellinghouse. 
<P>At the extremity of the garden which belonged to the mansion is a small building, originally about <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet square, and presenting an exterior of brick, absurdly called Queen Elizabeth's Lodge. It appears to have afforded access to the house through the grounds, and was probably built as a summer-house or porter's lodge, at the entrance of <pb id="P.263" n="263"> the garden, about the time the mansion-house was erected.   The arms of Fowler, bearing an esquire's helmet, are cut in stone on the west side of the building, near the top, which proves that the time of its erection was before the honour of knighthood had been conferred upon its owner.</QUOTE>
 
<P>The name attached to the lodge may have arisen from   some visit paid by Elizabeth to Sir Thomas Fowler or Sir John Spencer. 
<P>A house near the old charity school at the top of Cross Street was partly demolished by the London rioters in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, when it was occupied by the obnoxious Justice Hyde, who had ordered out the troops, and whose goods the true Protestants with the blue cockade burnt in the street. 
<P>In Cross Street, in <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>, died Mrs. Hester Milner, the youngest of <num value="10">ten</num> daughters of the Dr. John Milner in whose school Dr. John Hawkesworth and Oliver Goldsmith were assistants.   At the <QUOTE>Old Parr's Head,</QUOTE> at the corner of Cross Street, John Henderson, the best Falstaff ever known on he stage, made his <num value="1">first</num> appearance in public, by reciting Garrick's ode to Shakespeare, with close imitations of the actor's manner.   He appeared as Hamlet at the Bath Theatre in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>. 
<P>John Quick, a celebrated comedian, resided at Hornsey Row. He was the son of a Whitechapel brewer, and was the original Tony Lumpkin, Bob Acres, and Isaac Mendosa; he was <num value="1">one</num> of the last of the Garrick school, and was a great favourite of George III. He retired in <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, after thirtysix years on the boards, with <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>, and died in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="83">eighty-three</num>, another proof of the longevity of successful actors. Up to the last of his life Quick frequented a club at the <QUOTE>King's Head,</QUOTE> opposite the old church, and officiated as president. Mrs. Davenport was Quick's daughter. 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1818"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct> great interest was excited by the abduction of the child of a shipbroker, named Horsley, who resided at <num value="3">3</num>, Canonbury Lane. It had been stolen by a man named Rennett, who had conceived a hatred for the boy's grandfather, Charles Dignum, the singer, and also for the sake of the reward.   The man was tracked, taken, and eventually transported for <num value="7">seven</num> years. 
<P>Laycock's dairy farm faced Union Chapel, built by Mr. Leroux, at the beginning of the century. Laycock, an enterprising man, who died in <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, erected sheds for cattle on their way to Smithfield. Laycock and a Mr. Rhodes had gradually absorbed the   smaller grass farms (once the great feature of Islington), and which were common <num value="70">seventy</num> or <num value="80">eighty</num> years ago, says Mr. Lewis, writing in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>.

After being a private tutor and a corrector of the press, he opened a bookseller's shop under the Royal Exchange, London, and there wrote his Concordance. His mind becoming disordered at the bad reception of the Concordance, he was sent to an asylum at Bethnal Green, the practices at which he afterwards attacked, bringing an unsuccessful action against the celebrated Dr. Munro. In <datestruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>, on his release, he applied for the honour of knighthood, put himself in nomination for the City of London, and assumed the title of <QUOTE>Alexander the Corrector,</QUOTE> believing himself divinely inspired to reform a corrupt age. <num value="1">One</num> of his harmless eccentricities was going about with a sponge, erasing the, number <num value="45">forty-five</num> from the walls, to show his aversion for John Wilkes, against whom he published a pamphlet.

<P>And here we may, as well as anywhere else, sketch the history of the New River, which passes along Colebrooke Row, but was some years ago covered over.   In the reign of Elizabeth, the London conduits being found quite inadequate to the demands of the growing City, the Queen granted the citizens leave to convey a stream to London, from   any part of Middlesex or Hertfordshire. Nothing, however, was done, nor was even a <num value="2">second</num> Act, passed by King James, ever carried into effect. What all London could not do, a single publicspirited man accomplished. In <datestruct value="1609--"><year reg="1609">1609</year></datestruct>, Mr. Hugh Myddelton, a Welsh goldsmith, who had enriched himself by mines in Cardiganshire, persuaded the Common Council to transfer to him the power granted them by the above-mentioned Acts, and offered, in <num value="4">four</num> years, at his own risk and charge, to bring the Chadwell and Amwell springs from Hertfordshire to London, by a route more than <num value="38">thirty-eight</num> miles long. Endless vexations, however, befell the enterprising man. The greedy landholders of Middlesex and Herts did all they could to thwart him. Eventually he had to petition the City for an extension of the time for the fulfilment of his contract to <num value="9">nine</num> years, and at last, when the water had been brought as far as Enfield, Myddelton was so completely drained that he had to apply to the City for aid. On their ungenerous refusal, he resorted to the King, who, tempted by a moiety of the concern, paid half the expenses. The scheme then progressed   fast, and on the <datestruct VALUE="1613-09-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct>, the water was at last let into the New River Head, at Clerkenwell.

Many years previous to the pulling down of the building, it had been converted into a public-house, the common fate of most of the old respectable dwellings in this parish, and was latterly kept by a person named Pressey, who frequently accommodated strolling players with a large room in the house for the exhibition of dramatic performances.</QUOTE>

It was supposed to have been the residence of Queen Elizabeth's favourite cousin, Henry Carey, created by her Lord Hunsden. The front, abutting on Lower Street, was inscribed King John's Place, as that king was said to have had a hunting-lodge there. Sir Thomas Lovell rebuilt the house. It was <pb id="P.268" n="268"> supposed, from the armorial bearings in <num value="1">one</num> of the stained glass windows, that this chosen residence had been at <num value="1">one</num> time the abode of the great   Earl of Leicester, the most favoured of all Elizabeth's suitors. It afterwards became the property of Sir Robert Ducy, Bart., the banker of Charles I. The memorable mansion was celebrated for its rich windows, illustrating the subjects of the Faithful Steward and the Prodigal Son, and crowded besides with prophets and saints. There was also a magnificent chimney-piece, containing the arms of the City of London, with those of Lovell quartering Muswell or Mosell, the arms of St. John's Priory, always potent in this neighbourhood, besides those of Gardeners of London, grocer, and the Company of Merchant Adventurers. 
<P>Among the celebrities of Islington we may notice the following, in addition to those already given:--Sir Henry Yelverton, a judge of Common Pleas in the reign of Charles I., who was baptised at St. Mary's. He got entangled in opposition to the imperious Duke of Buckingham, and paid for it by an imprisonment in the Tower and a heavy fine. 
<P>Robert Brown, the founder of the sect of Brownists, was a lecturer at Islington. After flying to Holland, and being excommunicated on his return to England by a bishop, he went back to the Establishment about <datestruct value="1590--"><year reg="1590">1590</year></datestruct>, and accepted a living in Northamptonshire, where he lived a somewhat discreditable life.   For striking a constable who had demanded a rate from him Brown was sent to Northampton gaol, where he boasted that he had been in <num value="32">thirty-two</num> prisons. He died in <datestruct value="1630--"><year reg="1630">1630</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="81">eighty-one</num>. 
<P>Defoe was educated at a Nonconformist seminary at Islington, and <num value="4">four</num> years there was all the education the clever son of a butcher in St. Giles's seems ever to have had. <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.268.1">Edmund Halley</LEMMA>,   the celebrated astronomer royal, fitted up an observatory at Islington; and resided there from <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct> till <datestruct value="1696"><year reg="1696">1696</year></datestruct>. It was Halley who urged Newton to write the 
<title>Principia,</title> and superintended its publication. He is accused of gross unfairness to his <num value="2">two</num> great contemporaries, Leibnitz and Flamsteed, breaking open a sealed catalogue of fixed stars drawn up by the latter, and printing them with his own name. 
<P>Halley's greatest work was the <num value="1">first</num> prediction of the return of a comet, and a discovery of inequalities in the motion of Jupiter and Saturn, which confirmed Newton's great discovery of the law of gravitation. 
<P>Mrs. Foster, the granddaughter of Milton, kept a chandler's shop at Lower Holloway for some years, and died at Islington in <datestruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>. In her the family of Milton became extinct. She was poor and infirm, and in <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct> <title>Comus</title> was represented at Drury Lane Theatre for her benefit, Dr. Johnson writing the prologue, which was spoken by Garrick. She used to say that her grandfather was harsh to his daughters, and refused to allow them to be taught to write; but we must allow perhaps something for the perpetual irritation of gout, which would sour the temper of an archangel. At Newington Green resided Dr. Richard Price, a Nonconformist minister, celebrated for his financial calculations in connection with assurance societies. He was a friend of Howard, Priestley, and Franklin, and was consulted by Pitt as to the adoption of the Sinking Fund. He died in <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>. Mary Woolstonecroft, the wife of William Godwin, and the mother of Mrs. Shelley, in early life conducted a day-school at Newington Green. She was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> advocates of the rights of women, and died in <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>. 
<P>That excellent woman, Mrs. Barbauld, was wife of Mr. Barbauld, a minister at a Unitarian chapel on Newington Green. Amongst the vicars of St. Mary's we should not forget Daniel Wilson, Heber's successor as Bishop of Calcutta.   He succeeded the good Cecil at St. John's, Bedford Row. Nelson, the best of the Islington historians, lived and died, says Mr. W. Howitt, at his house at the corner of Cumberland Street, Islington Green. Rogers, the banker-poet, was born in <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct> at Newington Green, <QUOTE>the <num value="1">first</num> house that presents itself on the west side, proceeding from Ball's Pond.</QUOTE> On his mother's side Rogers was descended from Philip Henry, the father of Matthew Henry, the pious author of the well-known exposition of the Bible. In <num value="1">one</num> of the detached houses opposite Lorraine Place lived that pushing publisher and projector, Sir Richard Phillips.   We have described this active minded compiler elsewhere. Dr. Jackson, Bishop of London, was for a time head-master of the Islington Proprietary School. 
<P>The <QUOTE>Duke's Head,</QUOTE> at the south-east corner of Cadd's Row, near the Green, was, in the middle of the last century, kept by Thomas Topham, the celebrated <QUOTE>Strong Man</QUOTE> of Islington.   His most celebrated feats were pulling against a horse at a wall in Moorfields; and, finally, in <datestruct value="1741--"><year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct>, in Coldbath Fields, lifting <num value="3">three</num> hogsheads of water, weighing <measure value="1831l." type=currency><num value="1831">1,831</num> pounds</measure>, to commemorate the taking of Porto Bello by Admiral Vernon.   He once hoisted a sleeping watchman in his box, and dropped both box and watchman over the wall into Bunhill Fields Burying Ground. Towards the close of his life this unhappy Samson took a public-house in Hog Lane, Shoreditch, and there, in <datestruct value="1749--"><year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>, in a paroxysm of just jealousy, he stabbed his unfortunate wife and killed himself. <pb id="P.269" n="269">

<P>The manor of Canonbury, so called from a mansion of the Prior of the Canons of St. Bartholomew, was given to the priory by Ralph den Berners, not long after the Conquest. At the dissolution it fell into the receptive hands of Cromwell, the Lord Privy Seal, and at his execution an annuity from   the manor was bestowed on ill-favoured Anne of Cleves. In <datestruct value="1547--"><year reg="1547">1547</year></datestruct> Canonbury was granted by Edward VI. to John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, from whom it passed to the ill-starred Duke of Northumberland, only a few months before his beheadal. In <datestruct value="1570--"><year reg="1570">1570</year></datestruct> Lord Wentworth, to whom Queen Mary had granted the manor, alienated it to Sir John Spencer, <QUOTE>the rich Spencer</QUOTE> who figures so often in the civic history of Elizabeth's reign. 
<P>Sir John was an alderman and clothworker of London, sheriff in <datestruct value="1583--"><year reg="1583">1583</year></datestruct>-<num value="4">4</num>, and Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1594--"><year reg="1594">1594</year></datestruct>. He appears to have been a public-spirited honest man, and often stood forward boldly in defence of the Privileges of the City. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion we find him protesting against the great Bridge House granaries of London being taken as storehouses for the navy; and on another, resisting an attempt to force a new recorder on the City.   He also helped actively to suppress a riot of London apprentices, <num value="5">five</num> of whom were hung on Tower Hill. The wealth of Sir John was so notorious, that it is said a Dunkirk pirate once contrived a plot, with <num value="12">twelve</num> of his men, to carry him off, in hopes of obtaining   <num value="50000">50,000</num> as ransom. The men came in a shallop to Barking Creek, and hid themselves in ditches near a field-path leading to Sir John's house, but luckily for Sir John he was detained in London that night, and so the plot was frustrated. The residence of this citizen at Crosby House, where, in <datestruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></datestruct>, he entertained the French ambassador, the Marquis of Rosny, afterwards better known as the Duke of Sully, we have alluded to in a former chapter. Sir John's only daughter, Elizabeth, tradition says, was carried off from Canonbury House in a baker's basket, by the contrivance of her lover, young Lord Compton, and Mr. Lewis says this story is confirmed by a picture representing the fact preserved among the family paintings at Castle Ashby, a seat of the Comptons, in Northamptonshire. An old Islington vestry-clerk has preserved an anecdote about this curious elopement. Sir John, incensed at the stratagem, discarded his daughter, till Queen Elizabeth's kind interference effected a reconciliation. The wily queen, watching her opportunity, requested the knight to stand sponsor to the <num value="1">first</num> offspring of a young discarded couple.   Sir John complied, honoured and pleased at the gracious request, and her Majesty dictated his own surname for the Christian name of the child. The ceremony over, Sir John declared, as he had discarded his undutiful daughter, he would adopt the boy as his son. The queen then told him the truth, and the old knight, to his surprise, discovered that he had adopted his own grandson, who ultimately succeeded <QUOTE>his father in his honour, his grandfather in his wealth.</QUOTE> Sir John died in <datestruct value="1609--"><year reg="1609">1609</year></datestruct>, and in St. Helen's there is still his monument, with his daughter kneeling at the feet of his effigy. At his funeral about a <num value="1000">thousand</num> persons, clad in black gowns, attended, and <num value="320">320</num> poor men had each a basket given them, containing a black gown, <measure value="4l." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> pounds</measure> of. beef, <num value="2">two</num> loaves of bread, a little bottle of wine, a candlestick, a pound of candles, <num value="2">two</num> saucers, <num value="2">two</num> spoons, a black pudding, a pair of gloves, a dozen points, <num value="2">two</num> red herrings, <num value="4">four</num> white herrings, <num value="6">six</num> sprats, and <num value="2">two</num> eggs. 
<P>Lord Compton's mind was so shaken by the vast wealth he inherited at his father-in-law's death, that he became for a time insane. He died in <datestruct value="1630--"><year reg="1630">1630</year></datestruct>, of a fit produced by bathing in the Thames, after supping at Whitehall. A curiously imperious letter of his wife to   her lord was published in the 
<title>European Magazine</title> of <datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>. It begins with loving tyranny, and demands the most ample pin-money 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote>MY    SWEET LIFE--Now I have declared to you my mind for the settling of your state, I suppose that it were best for me to bethink or consider with myself what allowance were meetest for me. For considering what care I have had of your estate, and how respectfully I dealt with those which both by the laws of God, of nature, and of civil polity, wit, religion, government, and honesty, you, my dear, are bound to, I pray and beseech you to grant me <measure value="1600l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1600">1,600</num></measure> per annum, quarterly to be paid.</QUOTE>

In truth these citizens' daughters knew their rights, and exacted them. Lord Compton was created an earl in <datestruct value="1618--"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct>. The <num value="2">second</num> earl, a brave soldier, was killed during the Civil War, at the battle of Hopton Heath, in <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>-<num value="3">3</num>. 
<P>Canonbury House is generally supposed to have been built in <datestruct value="1362--"><year reg="1362">1362</year></datestruct>, <num value="10">ten</num> years after Edward III. had exempted the priory of St. Bartholomew from the payment of subsidies, in consequence of their great outlay in charity. Stow says that William Bolton (prior from <datestruct value="1509--"><year reg="1509">1509</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1532--"><year reg="1532">1532</year></datestruct>) rebuilt the house, and probably erected <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.270.1">the well-known brick tower</LEMMA>, as Nichols, in his <title>History of Canonbury,</title> mentions that his rebus, a bolt in a tun, was still to be seen cut in stone, in <num value="2">two</num> places, on the outside facing 
<FIGURE id="Fig.270" n="2000.07.0101"><HEAD>The New River Head. (From A View Published In <datestruct value="1753--"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 Well's Row.   The original house covered the whole of what is now Canonbury Place, and had a small park, with garden and offices. Prior Bolton either built or repaired the priory and church of St. Bartholomew, and, according to tradition, as Hall says, in his chronicle, fearing another flood, he built a tower on Harrow Hill, and victualled it for <num value="2">two</num> months. Stow, however, redeems the prior from ridicule, by telling us that the supposed tower proved to be only a dove-house. 
<P>The mansion was much altered by Sir John Spencer, who came to reside there, in splendour, about <datestruct value="1599--"><year reg="1599">1599</year></datestruct>, and it is now divided into several houses, Canonbury Place having absorbed the grand old residence, and portioned out its relics of bygone grandeur. A long range of tiled buildings, supposed to have been the stables of the old mansion, but which had become an appendage to the <QUOTE>Canonbury</QUOTE> Tavern, was pulled down in <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>. A tradition once prevailed at Islington that the monks of St. Bartholomew had a subterranean communication from Canonbury to the priory at Smithfield. This notion had arisen from the discovery of brick archways in Canonbury, which <pb id="P.271" n="271"> seem to have been only conduit heads, and had really served to lead water to the priory. 
<P>After the Spencers, the Lord-Keeper Coventry rented this house. In <datestruct value="1635--"><year reg="1635">1635</year></datestruct> we find the Earl of Derby detained here, and prevented from reaching St. James's by a deep snow; and in <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct> the Earl of Denbigh died here. About <datestruct value="1719--"><year reg="1719">1719</year></datestruct> it seems to have been let as lodgings. In <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct> it was advertised as a suitable resort for invalids, on account of the purity of the air of Canonbury, and the convenience of a sixpenny stage every hour to the City. It then became a resort for literary men, who craved for quiet and country air. Amongst those who lodged there was Samuel Humphreys, who died here from consumption, produced by over- 
<FIGURE id="Fig.271" n="2000.07.0102"><HEAD><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.271.1">Canonbury Tower, About <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct></LEMMA>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 work, in <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>. This Humphreys was a secondrate poet, who sang the glories of the Duke of Chandos's seat at Canons, and whose verse Handel praised for its harmony. Ephraim Chambers, the author of <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest cyclopaedias, also died here, in <datestruct value="1740--"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>. Among other lodgers at Canonbury House were Onslow, the Speaker; Woodfall, who printed <QUOTE>Junius ;</QUOTE> Deputy Harrison, many years printer of the <title>London Gazette</title>, and Mr. Robert Horsfield, successor to Messrs. Knapton, Pope's booksellers. 
<P>But the special glory of the old house is the fact that here Oliver Goldsmith for a time lodged and wrote, and also came here to visit his worthy friend and employer, Mr. John Newbury, the <pb id="P.272" n="272"> goodnatured publisher of children's books, who resided here, having under his protection the mad poet, Christopher Smart. We know for certain that at the close of <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, Goldsmith lodged at Islington, at the house of a Mrs. Elizabeth Fleming, to whom he paid   <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> a year. This choleric and strictly just landlady had her portrait taken by Hogarth, as tradition says, when he paid a visit to Goldsmith. Goldsmith frequently mentions Islington in his writings, and his jovial <QUOTE>shoemaker's holidays</QUOTE> were frequently made in this neighbourhood. The poet and <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> of his favourite friends used to breakfast at his Temple chambers about <num value="10">ten</num> a.m., and at <num value="11">eleven</num> they proceeded by the City Road and through the fields to dinner at Highbury Barn. About <num value="6">six</num> in the evening they adjourned to White Conduit House to tea, and concluded the evening by a merry supper at the Grecian or the Globe. 
<P> <QUOTE>The <num value="2">two</num> principal rooms,</QUOTE> says Lewis, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>which are in the <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="2">second</num> storeys of the plaister part of the building facing Canonbury Square, and appear to have been fitted up by Sir John Spencer, are each about <num value="20">twenty</num> feet square and <num value="12">twelve</num> feet high, and wainscoted with oak from the floor to the ceiling in complete preservation, and uncovered with paint. The lower room is divided into small panels, with fluted pilasters and a handsome cornice; and over the fireplace are <num value="2">two</num> compartments containing lions' heads, escalop shells, &amp;c., in finely carved oak, as represented in the engraving. The other room, which is over this, is yet more highly ornamented in the Grecian taste, with carved wainscot in panels, intersected with beautifully wrought pilasters. A handsome cornice runs round the top, composed of wreathed foliage and escalop shells, and over the fireplace are <num value="2">two</num> female figures carved in oak, representing  <Q>Faith</Q>  and  <Q>Hope,</Q>  with the mottoes, <foreign lang=la>Fides   Via   Deus   Mea,</foreign> and 
<foreign lang=la>Spes certa supra.</foreign> These are surmounted by a handsome cornice of pomegranates, with other fruit and foliage, having in the centre the arms of Sir John Spencer. The floors of both rooms are of very large fir boards, the ceilings are of plain plaister, and the windows are modern   glazed sashes, opening towards Canonbury Square. 
<P>The other apartments are smaller in size, and contain nothing worthy of remark. On the white wall of the staircase, near the top of the tower, are some Latin   hexameter verses, comprising the abbreviated names of the Kings of England, from William the Conqueror to Charles I., painted in Roman characters an inch in length, but almost obliterated. The lines were most probably the effusion of some poetical inhabitant of an upper apartment in the building, during the time of the monarch last named, such persons having frequently been residents of the place. 
<P>The adjoining house contains many specimens of the taste for ornamental carving and stucco work that prevailed about the time of Queen Elizabeth. At the top of the <num value="1">first</num> flight of stairs are <num value="2">two</num> male caryatide figures in armour, and a female carved in wood, fixed as ornaments in the corners of a doorway; and the ceilings of a fine set of rooms on the <num value="1">first</num> floor are elaborately embellished with a variety of devices in stucco, consisting of ships, flowers, foliage, &amp;c., with medallions of Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Titus Vespasian, &amp;c. The arms of Queen Elizabeth are also given in several places, <num value="1">one</num> of which bears also her initials  <Q> E.R.,</Q>  and the date <datestruct value="1599"><year reg="1599">1599</year></datestruct>, at which time the premises were fitted up by Sir John Spencer. The chimney-pieces in this house are very handsome, and in their original state must have had a rich and grand appearance, but they are now covered with white paint, although in other respects they have not sustained any material injury. <num value="1">One</num> of them   exhibits a very elaborate piece of workmanship in carved oak, containing figures of the Christian and cardinal virtues, and the arms of the City of London, with those of Sir John Spencer and the Clothworkers' Company, of which he was a member. There is also a monogram or device, apparently intended for his name, with the date <datestruct value="1601"><year reg="1601">1601</year></datestruct>, and the whole is supported by caryatides of a very elegant form. In another room is a chimney-piece divided into <num value="3">three</num> compartments, and intersected by handsome columns with Corinthian capitals, and containing a male and female figure in long robes, with the arms of Sir John Spencer in the centre, surrounded by curious carved work. The Spencer arms and the crest (an eagle volant) also occur in other parts of the sculpture, and the whole is supported by <num value="2">two</num> caryatides bearing on their heads baskets of fruit. The rooms of this house still retain the ancient wainscoting of oak in square and lozenge panels, but covered with white paint; and the old oak staircase also remains, together with several ponderous doors of the same wood, having massive bolts, hinges, and fastenings of iron. 
<P>In   another adjoining house is a handsome chimney-piece of carved oak, covered with white paint. In the passage of the house, placed over a door, is an arch having a blank escutcheon, and another charged with the rebus of Prior Bolton. There are also over another doorway the arms of Sir Walter Dennys, who was knighted (<num value="5">fifth</num> Henry VII.) on Prince Arthur being created Prince of <pb id="P.273" n="273">

<P>In <datestruct value="1271--"><year reg="1271">1271</year></datestruct> the prior of the convent of Knights Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem, at Clerkenwell, purchased an old manor house here, as a summer residence, and it was afterwards rebuilt higher to the eastward, changing its name from Tolentone to Highbury   In the reign of Richard II., when Wat Tyler and his bold Kentish men poured down on London, a detachment under Jack Straw, Wat's lieutenant, who had previously plundered and burnt the Clerkenwell convent, pulled down the house at Highbury. The ruins afterwards became known as- <QUOTE>Jack Straw's Castle.</QUOTE> It is thought by antiquaries that the prior's moated house had been the praetorium of the summer camp of the Roman garrison of London. 
<P>Many of the old conduit heads belonging to the City were at Highbury and its vicinity, <num value="1">one</num> of these supplied the parish of St. Giles's, Cripplegate; and Mr. Lewis mentions another remaining in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>, in a field opposite No. <num value="14">14</num>, Highbury Place.   It might have been from Highbury that the hunt took place, noted by Strype as occurring in <datestruct value="1562--"><year reg="1562">1562</year></datestruct>, when the Lord Mayor, aldermen, and many worshipful persons rode to the Conduit Heads, then hunted and killed a hare, and, after dining at the Conduit Head, hunted a fox and killed it, at the end of St. Giles's, Cripplegate, with a great hallooing and blowing of horns at his death; and thence the Lord Mayor, with all his company, rode through London to his place in Lombard Street.

<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.273.4">Highbury Barn</LEMMA>     (built on the site of the barn of the prior's old mansion) was originally a small ale and cake house. It was the old rendezvous of the Highbury Society as far back as the year <datestruct value="1740"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>. This society was established to commemorate the dropping of a Schism   Act, cruelly severe on Protestant Dissenters, and which was to have received the Royal sanction the day Queen Anne died. 
<P> <QUOTE>The party,</QUOTE> says a chronicler of the society, <QUOTE>who walked together from London had a rendezvous in Moorfields at <num value="1">one</num> o'clock, and at Dettingen Bridge (where the house known by the name <pb id="P.274" n="274"> of the <Q>Shepherd and Shepherdess</Q> now stands), they chalked the initials of their names on a post, for the information of such as might follow. They then proceeded to Highbury; and, to beguile their way, it was their custom in turn to bowl a ball of ivory at objects in their path. This ball has lately been presented to the society by Mr. William Field. After a slight refreshment, they proceeded to the field for exercise; but in those days of greater economy and simplicity, neither wine, punch, nor tea was introduced, and eightpence was generally the whole individual expense incurred. A particular game, denominated <hi rend=italics>hop-ball</hi>, has from time immemorial formed the recreation of the members of this society at their meetings. On a board, which is dated <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>, which they use for the purpose of marking the game, the following motto is engraven :-- <Q> Play justly; play moderately; play cheerfully; so shall ye play to a rational purpose.</Q>  It is a game not in use elsewhere in the neighbourhood of London, but <num value="1">one</num> something resembling it is practised in the West of England.

<P>At a little distance northward of Highbury Barn was another dairy-farm called Cream Hall, where Londoners came, hot and dusty, on shiny summer afternoons, to drink new milk and to eat custards, smoking sillabubs, or cakes dipped in frothing cream.

Mr. Willoughby, an enterprising proprietor who died in <datestruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>, increased the business, and his successors added a bowlinggreen, a trap ball-ground, and more gardens.

<P>Upper Holloway was the residence of the ancient and honourable Blount family, during a considerable part of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. Sir Henry Blount, <pb id="P.275" n="275"> who went to the Levant in <datestruct value="1634--"><year reg="1634">1634</year></datestruct>, wrote a curious book of travels, and helped to introduce coffee into England. He is said to have guarded the sons of Charles I. during the battle of Edgehill. His <num value="2">two</num> sons both became authors.   Thomas wrote <title>Remarks on Poetry,</title> and Charles was a Deist, who defended Dryden, attacked every <num value="1">one</num> else, and wrote the life of Apollonius Tyaneus. He shot himself in <datestruct value="1693--"><year reg="1693">1693</year></datestruct>, in despair at being refused ecclesiastical permission to marry the sister of his deceased wife. The old manor house of the Blounts was standing a few years ago. 
<P>Hornsey Road, which in Camden's time was a <QUOTE>sloughy lane</QUOTE> to Whetstone, by way of Crouch End, <num value="70">seventy</num> years ago had only <num value="3">three</num> houses, and no side paths, and was impassable for carriages. It was formerly called Devil's, or Du Val's, Lane, and further back still Tollington Lane. There formerly stood on the east side of this road, near the junction with the <num value="7">Seven</num> Sisters' Road, an old wooden moated house, called <QUOTE>The Devil's House,</QUOTE> but really the site of old Tollington House. Tradition fixed this lonely place as the retreat of Duval, the famous French highwayman in the reign of Charles II.   After he was hung in <datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>, he lay in state at a low tavern in St. Giles's, and was buried in the middle aisle of St. Paul's, Covent Garden, by torchlight. The tradition is evidently erroneous, as the Devil's House in Devil's Lane is mentioned in a survey of Highbury taken in <datestruct value="1611--"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct> (James I.)   Duval may, however, have affected the neighbourhood, as near a great northern road. The moat used to be crossed by a bridge, and the house in <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct> was a public-house, where Londoners went to fish, and enjoy hot loaves, and milk fresh from the cow.

<P>Copenhagen Fields were, it is said, the site of a public-house opened by a Dane, about the time when the King of Denmark paid his visit to his brother-in-law, James I.

Eventually, after the Restoration, it became a great tea-house, and a resort for players at skittles and Dutch pins. 
<P>The house was much frequented for its teagardens, its fine view of the Hampstead and Highgate heights, and the opportunities it afforded for recreation. Hone was told by a young woman who had been the landlady's assistant that in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct> a body of the Lord George Gordon rioters passed Copenhagen House with blue banners flying, on their way to attack Caen Wood, the seat of Lord Mansfield, and that the proprietor was so alarmed at this, that at her request Justice Hyde sent a party of soldiers to protect the establishment. Soon after this a robbery at the house was so much talked of, that the visitors began to increase, and additional rooms had to be built. The place then became famous for fives-playing, and here Cavanagh, the famous Irish player, immortalised in a vigorous essay by Hazlitt, won his laurels. In <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct> Hazlitt, who was an enthusiast about this lively game, writes, <QUOTE>Cavanagh used frequently to play matches at Copenhagen House for wagers and dinners. The wall against which they play is the same that supports the kitchen chimney; and when the ball resounded louder than usual, the cooks exclaimed,  <Q>Those are the Irishman's balls,</Q>  and the joints trembled on the spit.</QUOTE> The next landlord encouraged dog-fighting and bull-baiting, especially on Sunday mornings, and his licence was in consequence refused in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>. 
<P>In the early days of the French Revolution, when the Tories trembled with fear and rage, the fields near Copenhagen House were the scene of those meetings of the London Corresponding Society, which so alarmed the Government.

<P>After Horne Tooke's acquittal, he is reported to have remarked to a friend, that if a certain song, exhibited at the trial of Hardy, had been produced against him, he should have sung it to the jury; that, as there was no treason in the words, they might judge if there was any in the music.

<P>Maiden Lane (perhaps Midden or Dunghill Lane), an ancient way leading from Battle Bridge to Highgate, and avoiding the hill, was once the chief road for northern travellers.   At present, bone-stores, chemical works, and potteries render it peculiarly unsavoury. 
<P>Battle Bridge is so called for <num value="2">two</num> reasons. In the <num value="1">first</num> place, there was formerly a small brick bridge over the Fleet at this spot; and, secondly, because, as London tradition has steadily affirmed, here was fought the great battle between Suetonius Paulinus, the Roman general, and Boadicea, the Queen of the Iceni. It is still doubtful whether the scene of the great battle was so near London, but there is still much to be said in its favour. <pb id="P.277" n="277"> The arguments pro and con are worth a brief discussion. Tacitus describes the spot, with his usual sharp, clear brevity. <QUOTE>Suetonius,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>chose a place with narrow jaws, backed by a forest.</QUOTE> Now the valley of the Fleet, between Pentonville and Gray's Inn Lane, backed by the great northern forest of Middlesex, undoubtedly corresponds with this description, but then Tacitus, always clear and vivid, makes no mention of the river Fleet, which would have been most important as a defence for the front and flank of the Roman army, and this raises up serious doubts. The Roman summer camp near Barnsbury Park, opposite. Minerva Terrace, in the Thornhill Road, we have already mentioned. There was a praetorium there, a raised breastwork, long visible from the Caledonian Road, a well, and a trench. In <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct> arrow-heads and red-tiled pavements were discovered in this spot.

 bius expressly tells us, when Julius Caesar forced the passage of the Thames, near Chertsey, an elephant, with archers in a houdah on its back, led the way, and drove the astonished Britons to flight. Another important proof also exists. In <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct> a fragment of a Roman monumental inscription was found built into a cottage on the east side of Maiden Lane. It was part of the tomb of an officer of the <num value="20">twentieth</num> legion, which had been dug up in a field on the west side of the road leading to the Caledonian Asylum.   This legion formed part of the army of Claudius which Paulinus led against Boadicea. Mr. Tomlins, however, is inclined to think that a fight took place at Battle Bridge during the early Danish invasions. 
<P>The great battle with the Romans, wherever it took place, was an eventful <num value="1">one</num>, and was <num value="1">one</num> of the last great efforts of the Britons. Suetonius, with nearly <num value="10000">10,000</num> soldiers, waited for the rush of the wild <num value="200000">200,000</num> half-savage men, who had already sacked and destroyed Colchester, St. Albans, and London. His <num value="2">two</num>   legions were in the centre, his light-armed troops at hand, while his cavalry formed his right and left wings. Boadicea and her <num value="2">two</num> <pb id="P.278" n="278"> daughters, in a war-chariot, was haranguing her troops, while the wives of her soldiers were placed in wagons at the rear end of the army, to view the battle.   The Britons rushed to the attack with savage shouts, and songs of victory   the Romans received their charge with showers of javelins, and then advanced in the form of a wedge, the Britons eagerly opening their ranks, to surround and devour them up. The British chariots, armed with scythes, made great havoc among the Romans, till Suetonius ordered his legionaries to aim only at the charioteers. The Britons, however, after a stubborn fight, gave way before the close ranks of disciplined warriors, leaving some <num value="80000">80,000</num> men upon the field, while the Romans, shoulder to shoulder, are reported to have lost only <num value="400">400</num> men. The line of wagons with the women proved a fatal obstruction to the flight of the Britons. The last fact to be recorded about the Romans at Battle Bridge is the discovery, in <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>, under the foundation of a house in Maiden Lane, of an iron urn, full of gold and silver coins of the reign of Constantine.

In <datestruct value="1731--"><year reg="1731">1731</year></datestruct>, John Everett, a highwayman, was hung at Tyburn, for stopping a coach and robbing some ladies at Battle Bridge.     The man had served in Flanders as a sergeant, and had since kept an ale-house in the Old Bailey. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct> Battle Bridge assumed the name of King's Cross, from a ridiculous octagonal structure crowned by an absurd statue of George IV., which was erected at the centre of <num value="6">six</num> roads which there united. The building, ornamented by <num value="8">eight</num> Doric columns, was <num value="60">sixty</num> feet high, and was crowned by a statue of the king <num value="11">eleven</num> feet high. Pugin, in that bantering book, <QUOTE>The Contrasts,</QUOTE> ridiculed this effort of art, and contrasted it with the beautiful Gothic market cross at Chichester. The Gothic revival was only just then beginning, and the dark age was still dark enough. The basement was <num value="1">first</num> a police-station, then a public-house with a camera-obscura in the upper storey. The hideous monstrosity was removed in <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>.

The locality being notorious, it was proposed to call it St. George's Cross, or Boadicea's Cross, but Mr. Bray at last decreed that King's Cross was to be the name. 
<P>Early in the century the great dust-heaps of London (where now stand Argyle, Liverpool, and Manchester Streets) were some of the disgraces of London; and when the present Caledonian Road was fields, near Battle Bridge were heaped hillocks of horse-bones. The Battle Bridge dustmen and cinder-sifters were the, pariahs of the metropolis. The mountains of cinders and filth were the <hi rend=italics>debris</hi>
 of years, and were the haunts of innumerable pigs. The Russians, says the late Mr. Pinks, in his excellent <title>History of Clerkenwell,</title> bought all these ash-heaps, to help to rebuild Moscow after the French invasion. The cinder-ground was eventually sold, in <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>, to the Pandemonium   Company for <measure value="15000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="15000">15,000</num></measure>, who walled in the whole and built the Royal Clarence Theatre at the corner of Liverpool Street. Somewhere near this Golgotha was a piece of waste ground, where half the brewers of the metropolis shot their grains and hop-husks.

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 

 
<P>The site of Pentonville was once an outlying possession of the priory of St. John, Clerkenwell, and called the <QUOTE>Commandry Mantels,</QUOTE> from its having belonged to Geoffrey de Mandeville-<hi rend=italics>vulgo</hi>, Mantell. Eventually the fields were given to the Hospitallers. There were springs and conduit-heads in the meadows; and Gerard, the Elizabethan herbalist, specially mentions the white saxifrage as growing abundantly there. 
<P>The district of Pentonville, once a mere nameless vassal of Clerkenwell and Islington (the latter itself a comparative parvenu), received its present name from Henry Penton, Esq., member for Winchester, and a Lord of the Admiralty, who died in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, and on whose estate the <num value="1">first</num> buildings in Penton Street were erected, according to Mr. Pinks, about the year <datestruct value="1773"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>. 
<p>The <QUOTE>Belvidere</QUOTE> Tavern, at the corner of Penton Street, was at an early period the site of a house known as <QUOTE>Busby's Folly,</QUOTE> probably from Christopher Busby, who was landlord of the <QUOTE>Whyte Lyon,</QUOTE> at Islington, in <datestruct value="1668--"><year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1664--"><year reg="1664">1664</year></datestruct> (<num value="4">four</num> years after the Restoration), the members of the quaint Society of Bull Feathers' Hall met at the Folly before marching to Islington, to claim the toll of all gravel carried up Highgate Hill. Their <num value="30">thirty</num> pioneers, with spades and pickaxes, were preceded in the hall procession by trumpeters and hornblowers. Their standard was a large pair of horns fixed to a pole, and with pennants hanging to each tip. Next came the flag of the society, attended by the master of the ceremonies. After the flag came the mace-bearers and the herald-at-arms of the society. The supporters of the arms were a woman with a whip, and the motto, <QUOTE lang=la>Ut volo, sic jubeo</QUOTE>; on the other side, a rueful man, and the motto, <QUOTE lang=la>Patientia patimur.</QUOTE>
 
<P>This singular club met in Chequer Yard, Whitechapel, the president wearing a crimson satin gown, and a furred cap surmounted by a pair of antlers, while his sceptre and crown were both horned. The brethren of this great and solemn fraternity drank out of horn cups, and were sworn as members on a blank horn-book. Busby's house retained its name as late as <datestruct value="1710"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct>, but was afterwards called <QUOTE>Penny's Folly.</QUOTE> It had <num value="14">fourteen</num> windows in front; and here men with learned horses, musical glasses, and sham philosophical performances, gave evening entertainments. The <QUOTE>Belvidere</QUOTE> Tavern was in existence as early as <datestruct value="1780"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, and was famous for its-racket-court. At No. <num value="37">37</num>, Penton Street, that emperor of English clowns, 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.279.2">Joe Grimaldi</LEMMA>, lived in <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>, after his marriage with Miss Hughes, the pretty daughter of the manager of Sadler's Wells. Penton Street was then the St. James's or Regent's Park of the City Road quarter. 
<P>On the west side of Penton Street is a new church, opened in <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct>. It contains sittings for <num value="1259">1,259</num> persons, and with the site cost about <measure value="8600l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="8600">8,600</num></measure>. The <num value="1">first</num> incumbent was Dr. Courtenay, formerly curate of St. James's, Pentonville. St. James's was made a district, assigned out of the parish of St. James's, Clerkenwell, in <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>. On the east side of Penton Street formerly stood that celebrated Cockney place of amusement, <QUOTE>White Conduit House.</QUOTE> The original tavern was erected in the reign of Charles I., and the curious tradition was that the workmen were said to have been regaling themselves after the completion of the building the very hour that King Charles's head fell at the Whitehall scaffold.   In <datestruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct> <QUOTE>White Conduit House</QUOTE> was advertised as having for its fresh attractions a long walk, a circular fish-pond, a number of pleasant shady arbours, enclosed with a fence <num value="7">seven</num> feet high, hot loaves and butter, milk direct from <pb id="P.280" n="280"> the cow, coffee, tea, and other liquors, a cricketfield, unadulterated cream, and a handsome long room, with <QUOTE>copious prospects, and airy situation.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct> the following spirited verses describing the place, by William Woty, author of the

<P>About this time the house and its customers were referred to by Oliver Goldsmith.   He says, <QUOTE>After having surveyed   the curiosities of this fair and beautiful town   (Islington), I proceeded forward, leaving a fair stone building on my right. Here the   inhabitants of   London   often   assemble to celebrate a feast of hot rolls and butter. Seeing such numbers, each with their little tables before them, employed   on   this occasion, must no doubt be a very amusing sight to the looker-on, but still more so to those who perform   in the solemnity.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>White Conduit Loaves,</QUOTE> says Mr. Timbs, <QUOTE>was <num value="1">one</num> of the common London street-cries, before the French war raised the price of bread.</QUOTE> 
<P>Washington Irving, in his <title>Life of Goldsmith,</title>
 says:-- <QUOTE>Oliver Goldsmith, towards the close of <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, removed to  <Q>Merry Islington,</Q>  then a country village, though now swallowed up in omnivorous London. In this neighbourhood he used to take his solitary rambles, sometimes extending his walks to the gardens of the  <Q>White Conduit House,</Q>  so famous among the essayists of the last century. While strolling <num value="1">one</num> day in these gardens he met <num value="3">three</num> daughters of the family of a respectable tradesman, to whom he was under some obligation. With his prompt disposition to oblige, he conducted them about the garden, treated them to tea, and ran up a bill in the most open-handed manner imaginable. It was only when he came to pay that he found himself in <num value="1">one</num> of his old dilemmas.   He had not the wherewithal in his pocket. A scene of perplexity now took place between him and the waiter, in the midst of which came up some of his acquaintances, in whose eyes he wished to stand particularly well. When, however, they had enjoyed their banter, the waiter was paid, and poor Goldsmith enabled to carry off the ladies with flying colours.</QUOTE> 
<P>This popular place of amusement derives its name from an old stone conduit, removed in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>, and used to repair part of the New Road. It bore the date <datestruct value="1641"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, and beneath, the arms of Sutton, the founder of the Charterhouse, with initials and monograms probably of past masters. The conduit, repaired by Sutton, was built in the reign of Henry VI., and it supplied the Carthusian friars. The waterhouse was used by the school till about <datestruct value="1654--"><year reg="1654">1654</year></datestruct>, when the supply fell short, and a New River supply was decided on. The site of the conduit was at the back of No. <num value="10">10</num>, Penton Street, at the corner of Edward Street. There was a smaller conduit at the back of White Conduit Gardens, close to where Warren Street now stands. In <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, Huntington (Sinner Saved) the preacher, cleansed the spring, but his enemies choked it with mud to spite him. Latterly, however, the Conduit House fell to ruins, and the upper floors became a mighty refuge for tramps and street pariahs. 
<P>An old drawing of <datestruct value="1731--"><year reg="1731">1731</year></datestruct> represents White Conduit House as a mere tall building, with <num value="4">four</num> front windows, a gable roof, a side shed, and on the other <pb id="P.281" n="281">

<P>The anonymous writer of the <QUOTE>Sunday Ramble,</QUOTE> <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, describes the place as having boxes. for tea, cut into the hedges and adorned with pictures; pleasant garden walks, a round fish-pond, and .<num value="2">two</num> handsome tea-rooms. Later the fish-pond was filled up, and an Apollo dancing-room erected. In <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct> a <QUOTE>Minor Vauxhall</QUOTE> was established here, and the place became somewhat disreputable. Mr. Chabert, the fire-eater, after a collation of phosphorus, arsenic, and oxalic acid, with a sauce of boiling oil and molten lead, walked into an oven, preceded by a leg of lamb and a rump-steak, and eventually emerged with them completely baked, after which the spectators dined with him. Graham also ascended from these gardens in his balloon. In this year Hone talks of the gardens as <QUOTE>just above the very lowest,</QUOTE> though the fireworks were as good as usual. 
<P>About <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct> archery was much practised; and in <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct> the house was rebuilt with a great ball-room and many architectural vagaries. A writer in the 
<title>Mirror</title> of <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct> says:-- <QUOTE>Never mind Pentonville, it is not now what   it was, a place of some rural beauty. The fields behind it were, in my time, as wild and picturesque, with their deep-green lanes, richly   hedged   and studded with   <hi rend=italics>flowers, which</hi>
 have taken fright and moved   on miles awayand their  <Q>stately elms and hillocks green,</Q>  as they are now   melancholy and cut up with unfurnished, and, of course, unoccupied rows of houses, run up during the paroxysm of the brick and   mortar mania of times past, and now tumbling in ruins, with the foolish fortunes of   the   speculators. The march of town innovation upon the suburbs has driven before it all that was green, silent, and fitted for meditation.   Here, too, is that paradise of apprentice boys,  <Q>White Cundick Couse,</Q>  as it is cacophoniously pronounced by its visitors, which has done much to expel the decencies of the district. <num value="30">Thirty</num> years ago this place was better frequented--that is, there was a larger number of respectable adults; fathers and mothers, with their children, and a smaller moiety of shop-lads, and such-like Sunday bucks, who were awed into decency by their elders. The manners, perhaps, are much upon a par with what they were. The ball-room gentlemen then went through country dances with their hats on and their coats off. Hats are now taken off, but coats are still unfashionable on these gala nights. The belles of that day wore long trains to their gowns.   It was a favourite mode of introduction to a lady there to tread on the train, and then apologising handsomely, acquaintance was begun, and soon ripened into an invitation to tea and the hot loaves for which these gardens were once celebrated.   Being now a popular haunt, those who hang on the rear of the march of human nature, the sutlers, camp-followers, and plunderers, know that where large numbers of men or boys are in pursuit of pleasure, there is a sprinkling of the number to whom vice and debauchery are ever welcome; they have, therefore, supplied what these wanted, and Pentonville may now hold up its head, and boast of its depravities before any other part of London.</QUOTE> 
<P>The place grew worse and worse, till, in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>, the house was pulled down and streets built on its site.   The present <QUOTE>White Conduit</QUOTE> Tavern covers a portion of the original gardens.   Mr. George Cruikshank has been heard to confess that some of his early knowledge of Cockney character, and, indeed, of City human nature, was derived from observing evenings at White <QUOTE>Conduit House.</QUOTE> 
<P>An old proprietor of the gardens, who died in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, Mr. Christopher Bartholomew was believed to have realised property to the amount of <num value="50000">50,000</num>. The <QUOTE>Angel,</QUOTE> at Islington, was also his; and he used to boast that he had more haystacks than any <num value="1">one</num> round London. He, however, became a prey to the vice of gambling, and is said at last to have sometimes spent more than <num value="2000">2,000</num> guineas in a single day in insuring   numbers at the lottery. By degrees he sank into extreme poverty, but a friend giving him half of a <num value="16">sixteenth</num> of a favourite number, that turned up a <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure> prize, he again became affluent, only to finally sink into what proved this time irreparable ruin.

 Embankment, projected by Martin, the painter, and others, and the Holborn Viaduct, projected by Mr. Charles Pearson) was planned out nearly half a century ago, by active London minds. In <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct> John Perkins, Esq., of Bletchingley, in Surrey, struck with the dirt and cruelty of Smithfield, and the intolerable danger and mischief produced by driving vast and half-wild flocks and herds of cattle through the narrow and crowded London streets, projected a new market in the fine grazing district north of the metropolis. The place was built at an expense of <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure>, and opened under an Act of Parliament, <datestruct VALUE="1836-04-18"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=18>18th</day>, <year reg=1836>1836</year></datestruct>.   So strong, however, was the popular and Conservative interest in old abuses, that the excellent new market proved a total failure, and was soon closed. The area for cattle at Islington was nearly <num value="15">fifteen</num> acres, abutting on the road leading from the Lower Street to Ball's Pond. It was enclosed by a brick wall, <num value="10">ten</num> feet high, and had vast sheds on all the <num value="4">four</num> sides.   A   road ran entirely round the market, which was quadrated by paths crossing it at right angles, and there was to have been a central circus, to be used as an exchange for the greasy graziers and bustling salesmen, with offices for the <pb id="P.283" n="283"> money-takers and clerks of the market. The market was capable of accommodating <num value="7000">7,000</num> head of cattle, <num value="500">500</num> calves, <num value="40000">40,000</num> sheep, and <num value="1000">1,000</num> pigs. The principal entrance from the Lower Road had an arched gateway, and <num value="2">two</num> arched footways. Poor Mr. Perkins, he was before his age. The spot was excellently chosen, lying as it does near the great roads from the northern and eastern counties, the great centres of cattle, and communicating easily with the town by means of the City Road, which was also convenient for the western part of London. <num value="20">Twenty</num> years later, in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, the nuisance of Smithfield (thanks, perhaps, to <title>Oliver Twist</title>) became unbearable, even to the long-suffering abuse-preservers; so Smithfield was condemned to be removed, and a new cattle-market was opened in Copenhagen Fields in <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>, and that enriched district now rejoices in many cattle and all the attending delights of knackers' yards, slaughterhouses, tripe-dressers, cats'-meat-boilers, catgut-spinners, bone-boilers, glue-makers, and tallow-melters.

<P>That eccentric preacher, William Huntington, was an illegitimate son, whose reputed father was a day-labourer in Kent. In youth he was alternately an errand-boy, gardener, cobbler, and coal-heaver. He seems, even when a child, to   have been endowed with an extraordinary deep sensibility to religious impressions, and early in life he began to exhort men to save their souls, and flee the wrath to come, and, we fully believe, in all sincerity, though his manner was vulgar.   His original name was. Hunt, but flying the country to escape the charge of an illegitimate child, he took for safety the name of Huntington; and, unable to pay for a Dissenting title. of D.D., he christened himself S.S. (sinner saved).   Huntington seems to have had a profound belief in the efficacy of faith and prayer.   Whether it was tea, a horse, a pulpit, or a hod of lime, he prayed for it, he tells us, and it came.   Even   a pair of leather breeches was thus supplied, as he mentions in his John Bunyan way. 
<P> <QUOTE>I often,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>made very free in my prayers with my invaluable Master for this favour; but he still kept me so amazingly poor, that I could not get them, at any rate. At last I was determined to go to a friend of mine at Kingston, who is of that branch of business, to bespeak a pair, and to get him to trust me until my Master sent me money to pay him.   I was that day going to London, fully determined to bespeak them as I rode through the town.   However, when I passed the shop, I forgot it; but when I came to London I called on Mr. Croucher, a shoemaker in Shepherds' Market, who told me a parcel was left there for me, but what it was he knew not.   I opened it, and behold, there was a pair of <hi rend=italics>leather breeches</hi> with a note in them, the substance of which was to the best of my remembrance as follows:-- <Q> Sir,-- I have sent you a pair of breeches, and   I hope they will fit.   I beg your acceptance of them;    and if they want any alteration, leave in a note what the alteration is, and I will call in a few   days and alter them.-J. S.</Q>      I tried them     on, and they fitted as well as if I had been measured for them; at which I was amazed, having never been measured by any leather breeches maker in London.</QUOTE> 
<P>S. S. had strong belief in eternal perdition, and attacked the mad prophet Brothers, for his wild prophecies of the sudden fall of the Turkish, German, and Russian empires. When Huntington's chapel, in Tichfield Street was burnt, his congregation erected a new <num value="1">one</num> on the east side of Gray's Inn Lane, at a cost of <measure value="9000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="9000">9,000</num></measure>, of which he craftily obtained the personal freehold. By his <num value="1">first</num> wife S. S. had <num value="13">thirteen</num> children; he then married the widow of Sir James Sanderson, who came <num value="1">one</num> day to his chapel to ridicule him, but <QUOTE>remained to pray,</QUOTE> and to fall in love. He died in <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, and was buried in a garden in the rear of Jireh Chapel, on the cliff at Lewes.   A few hours before his death, at Tunbridge Wells, he dictated the following epitaph for himself:--

I told him, however, that I should prophesy to thousands before I died; and soon after the doors began to be opened to receive my message. When this appeared, and I had left the slavish employment of coal-carrying, others objected to my master against such a fellow as me taking up the office of a minister.

<P> <QUOTE>Huntington is described as having been, towards the close of his career, a fat burly man with a red face, which rose just above the cushion, and a thick, guttural and rather indistinct voice.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>His pulpit prayers,</QUOTE> writes a contemporary, <QUOTE>are remarkable for omitting the king or his country. He excels in extempore eloquence.   Having formally announced his text, he lays his Bible at once aside, and never refers to it again. He has every possible text and quotation at his finger's end.   He proceeds directly to his object,   and, except such incidental digressions as  <Q>Take care of your pockets!</Q>   <Q>Wake that snoring sinner!</Q>   <Q>Silence that noisy numskull!</Q>   <Q>Turn out that drunken dog!</Q>  he never deviates from his course, Nothing can exceed his dictatorial dogmatism. Believe him-none but him-that's enough. When he wishes to bind the faith of his congregation, he will say, over and over,  <Q> As sure as I am born, &lsquo;tis so;</Q>  or,  <Q> I believe this,</Q>  or  <Q>I know this,</Q>  or  <Q> I am sure of it,</Q>  or  <Q> I believe the plain English of it to be this.</Q>  And then he will add, by way of clenching his point,  <Q>Now you can't help it</Q> ; or,  <Q>It must be so, in spite of you.</Q>  He does this with a most significant shake of the head, and with a sort of Bedlam hauteur, with all the dignity of defiance. He will then sometimes observe, softening his deportment,  <Q>I don't know whether I make you understand these things, but I understand them well.</Q>  He rambles sadly, and strays so completely from his text, that you often lose sight of it. The divisions of his subject are so numerous, that <num value="1">one</num> of his sermons might be divided into <num value="3">three</num>. Preaching is with him   talking; his discourses, storytelling. Action he has none, except that of shifting his handkerchief from hand to hand, and hugging his cushion.   Nature has bestowed on him a vigorous, original mind, and he employs it in everything.   Survey him when you will, he seems to have rubbed off none of his native rudeness or blackness. All his notions are his own, as well as his mode of imparting them. Religion has not been discovered by him through the telescopes of commentators.</QUOTE>

<P>Penton Place, leading to what was once called Bagnigge Wash, used to be frequently overflowed, when the   Fleet Sewer was swollen by heavy rains or rapid thaws.

In <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct> Grimaldi lived here, and took in brother actors as lodgers.   He removed to Penton Street in <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>. This wonderful clown was the son of a celebrated Genoese clown and dancer, who came to England in <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>, in the capacity of dentist to Queen Charlotte. He played at Drury Lane, under Garrick's management, and was generally known on the boards, from   his great strength, as <QUOTE>Iron Legs.</QUOTE> At <num value="1">one</num> performance the agile comic dancer is said to have jumped so high that he actually broke a chandelier which hung over the side stage-door, and kicked <num value="1">one</num> of the glass drops into the face of the Turkish ambassador, who was gravely sitting in a stage-box. Joe was born in <datestruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct>, in Stanhope Street, Clare Market, and his <num value="1">first</num> appearance was at Sadler's Wells, in <datestruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct>, before he was <num value="3">three</num> years old. Grimaldi's amusements, in his leisure time, were innocent enough; he was devoted to the breeding of pigeons and collecting of insects, which latter amusement he pursued with such success, as to form a cabinet containing no fewer than <num value="4000">4,000</num> specimens of butterflies, <QUOTE>collected,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>at the expense of a great deal of time, a great deal of money, and a great deal of vast and actual labour;</QUOTE> for all of which, no doubt, the entomologist will deem him sufficiently rewarded. He appears, in old age, to have entertained a peculiar relish for these pursuits, and would call to   mind a part of Surrey where there was a very famous sort, and a part of Kent where there was another famous species. <num value="1">One</num> of these was called the <QUOTE>Camberwell Beauty</QUOTE> (which, he   adds, was very ugly); and another, the <QUOTE>Dartford Blue,</QUOTE> by which Dartford Blue he seems to have set great store.

On running back to the theatre that <pb id="P.286" n="286"> night he found the crowd of people collected round it so dense, as to render approach by the usual path impossible. <QUOTE>Filled with anxiety,</QUOTE> says his <title>Memoirs,</title> <QUOTE>and determined to ascertain the real state of the case, he ran round to the opposite bank of the New River, plunged in, swam across, and, finding the parlour window open and a light at the other end of the room, threw up the sash and jumped in, <hi rend=italics>a la</hi> Harlequin.   What was his horror, on looking round, to discover that there lay stretched in the apartment no fewer than <num value="9">nine</num> dead bodies!

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.286.1">celebrated miser, Thomas Cooke</LEMMA>. This miserable wretch was the son of an itinerant fiddler near Windsor. Early in life he was a common porter, but by a stratagem obtained the hand of the rich widow of a paper-maker at Tottenham, and then bought a sugar-baker's business at Puddle Dock. Here his miserable life as a miser began.   He would often feign fits near a respectable house, to obtain a glass of wine. His ink he begged at offices, and his paper he stole from   the Bank counters. It is said that he collected with his own hands manure for his garden. His horse he kept in his kitchen, and his chaise he stored up in his bed room. His <num value="1">one</num> annual treat was the Epsom Races. Turned out of this house at last, Cooke betook himself to No. <num value="85">85</num>, White Lion Street, Pentonville, and died in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="86">eighty-six</num>.

In    <num value="787">787</num>, however, a chapel was begun by subscription, and was opened in   <num value="788">788</num>.

<P>Pentonville Chapel is built chiefly of brick, with a stone facade.   The building stands north and south, instead of east and west.

<P>Prospect House, in Winchester Place, now Pentonville Road, was <num value="1">one</num> of those old houses of half rural entertainment once common in this part of London.

<P>While on the subject of places of amusement in the north--of London, near Islington, we must not forget Sadler's Wells (Islington Spa), or New Tunbridge Wells, as it used to be called. The chalybeate spring was discovered in <datestruct value="1683--"><year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct> by a Mr. Sadler, a surveyor of the highways, in a pleasant, retired, and well-wooded garden of a music-house he had just opened. The discovery was trumpeted in a pamphlet, detailing the virtues of the water. It was, the writer asserted, a holy well, famed, before <num value="73">73</num> the Reformation, for its healing power, which the priests attributed to their prayers. It had been, in consequence, looked on as a place venerated by superstition, but arched over at the Reformation, it had been since forgotten. 
<P>The Wells soon became famous with hypochondriacs. Burlesque poems (<num value="1">one</num> probably by Ned Ward<NOTE> <QUOTE>Islington Wells; or, The Threepenny Academy, <datestruct value="1654--"><year reg="1654">1654</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> </NOTE>) were written on the humours of the place, <pb id="P.290" n="290"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.290.1">Bill of Play, Sadler's Wells Theater-<datestruct VALUE="1840-06-29"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=29>29</day>, <year reg=1840>1840</year></datestruct></LEMMA></NOTE>
 as well as treatises on the cure of invalids by drinking the water; and finally, in <datestruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct>, George Colman produced a farce, called   The <title>Spleen; or, Islington Spa</title>. 
<P>In the summer of <datestruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct> Sadler's Wells became in high favour with the public. Gout-hobbled there; Rheumatism groaned over his ferruginous water; severe coughs went arm-in-arm, chuckling as they hobbled; as for Hypochondria, he cracked jokes, he was in such high spirits at the thought of the new remedy.   At this time dancers were admitted during the whole of the day on Mondays and Tuesdays, says Malcolm, provided they did not come in masks. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct> the Wells were so fashionable that the Princesses Amelia and Caroline frequented the gardens in the June of that year daily, and drank the waters, the nobility coming in such numbers that the proprietor took above <measure value="30l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30">30</num></measure> a morning. Feathers flaunted, silks rustled, fans fluttered, and lovers sighed, partly with nausea and partly with love, as they sipped the bitter waters of AEsculapius. On the birthday of <num value="1">one</num> of the princesses, the ladies were saluted as they passed through Spa. Fields (then full of carriages) by a discharge of <num value="21">twenty-one</num> guns--a compliment always paid to them   on their arrival--and in the evening there was a great bonfire, and more powder was burnt in their honour. On ceasing to visit the gardens, the Princess Amelia presented the master with <num value="25">twenty-five</num> guineas, each of the water-servers with <num value="3">three</num> guineas, and the other attendants with <num value="1">one</num> guinea each. 
<P>From   <datestruct value="1683--"><year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct> till after   <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct> these gardens were famous.   Nervous, hypochondriac, hysteric affections, asthmas, indigestions, swellings, and eruptions, all took their doleful pleasure in them, and drank the waters with infinite belief.   In <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct> the Wells were still frequented. The subscription for the water was a guinea the season; to non-subscribers, and with capillaire, it cost sixpence a glass.   The spring was then enclosed by an artificial grotto of flints and shells, which was entered by a rustic gate; there was a lodging-house, to board invalids, and in the garden a breakfast-room, about <num value="40">forty</num> feet long, with a small orchestra.   In the room was hung up a comparative analysis of the water,   and there were testimonials of its efficacy from   gentlemen who had been ill for quarters of centuries, and had drunk all other mineral waters in vain. 
<P>On the bark of <num value="1">one</num> of the trees (before <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct> ) were cut the <num value="2">two</num> following lines:<NOTE>Nelson's <QUOTE>Islington,</QUOTE> <num value="1">1st</num> edit., p. <num value="212">212</num>.</NOTE>- 
<QUOTE lang=la REND=blockquote><L>Obstructum recreat; durum terit; humidum siccat;

 The following lines were written in a room of the lodging-house, just as   a votive tablet might have been hung up on the walls of a Greek temple:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>For <num value="3">three</num> times <num value="10">ten</num> years I travell'd the globe,

<L>Spa, Epsom (and all by advice of the College); 
<L>But in vain, till to Islington waters I came, 
<L>To try if my cure would add to their fame. 
<L>In less than <num value="6">six</num> weeks they produc'd a belief

 Amusements resembling those of Vauxhall-music, fireworks, &amp;c.----were resorted to at New Tunbridge Wells, in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>-<datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, but without much success. 
<P>On the death of   Sadler, his music-house passed to Francis Forcer, whose son exhibited rope-dancing and tumbling till <datestruct value="1730"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, when he died. 
<P>The place was then taken by Mr. Rosoman, a builder, and the wooden house was, about the year <datestruct value="1765"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, replaced by <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.290.2">a brick building</LEMMA>.   A painting, introducing Rosoman and some of his actors, was in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, to be seen in the bar of the <QUOTE>Sir Hugh Myddelton,</QUOTE> the inn introduced by Hogarth in his print of <QUOTE>Evening,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1738--"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>.   There was a club, at this time, at the <QUOTE>Sir Hugh Myddelton,</QUOTE> of actors, who, in <datestruct value="1753--"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct>, formed a regular company, at what had now become a theatre. The amusements here were originally in the open air, the tickets to spectators including refreshments. The <title>Connoisseur</title>, of <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>, notes the feats of activity exhibited here.   After that time this suburban theatre became famous for burlettas, musical interludes, and pantomimes.   Here Grimaldi cracked his drollest jokes, and here the celebrated Richer exhibited on the tight rope.   The New River was also taken advantage of, and introduced into a tank the size of the stage, to represent more effectively naval victories and French defeats. After Rosoman, Mr. Thomas King, the comedian, and Mr. Wroughton, of Drury Lane, became proprietors; and at <num value="1">one</num> time Mr. Charles Dibdin, jun., was Stage-manager. 
<P>A most fatal panic took place at this theatre on the   <datestruct VALUE="1807-10-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>,   <year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>. The cry, <QUOTE>A fight!</QUOTE> was mistaken for <QUOTE>A fire!</QUOTE> and a rush took place from the gallery. The manager, shouting to the people through speaking-trumpets, entreated them to keep their seats; but in vain, for many threw themselves down into the pit, and eighteen were crushed to death on the gallery stairs.   The proceed of <num value="2">two</num> <pb id="P.291" n="291">

 benefits were divided among the children and widows of the sufferers. 
<P>Sadler's Musical House, which, tradition affirms, was a place of public entertainment even as early as the reign of Elizabeth, seems early to have affected a theatrical air. In <datestruct VALUE="1698-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>, we find a vocal and instrumental concert advertised here, the instrumental part being <QUOTE>composed of violins, hautboys, trumpets, and kettle-drums.</QUOTE> It was to continue from <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, every Monday and Thursday, during the drinking of the waters.   In <datestruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct> the Wells were called <QUOTE>Miles's Music House;</QUOTE> and in that year Ned Ward, always coarse and always lively, describes going with a crowd of Inns of Court beaux to see a wretch, disguised in a fool's cap, and with a smutty face like a hangman, eat a live fowl, feathers and all. 
<P> <QUOTE>The state of things described by Ned Ward,</QUOTE> says Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE>is abundantly confirmed by the reminiscences of Edward Macklin, the actor, who remembered the time when the admission here was but threepence, except to a few places scuttled off at the sides of the stage at sixpence, which were reserved for people of fashion, who occasionally came to see the fun.  <Q> Here we smoked and drank porter and rum-and-water, as much as we could pay for.</Q>  Of the audience Macklin says,  <Q>Though we had a mixture of very odd company, there was little or no rioting; there was a public then that kept <num value="1">one</num> another in awe.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P>Ned Ward, who was a quick observer, describes the dress-circle gallery here as painted with stories of Apollo and Daphne, Jupiter and Europa, &amp;c. In his poem, <title>A Walk to Islington,</title> Ned Ward is not complimentary to the Sadler's Wells visitors. In the pit, he says, were butchers, bailiffs, housebreakers, footpads, prizefighters, thief-takers, deerstealers, and bullies, who drank, and smoked, and lied, and swore. They ate cheesecakes and drank ale, and <num value="1">one</num> of the buffoons was also a waiter. The female vocalist was followed by a fiddler in scarlet. Then came a child, who danced a sword-dance, and after her 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>A young babe of grace, 
<L>With mercury in his heels, and a gallows in his face; 
<L>In dancing a jig lies the chief of whose graces, 
<L>And making strange music-house, monkey-like faces.</QUOTE>
 
<P>About <datestruct value="1711--"><year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct> the Wells seems to have become still more disreputable, and in <datestruct value="1712--"><year reg="1712">1712</year></datestruct> a lieutenant of the navy was run through the body there by a Mr. French, of the Temple, in a drunken quarrel. 
<P>Macklin says there were <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> exhibitions in a day, and that the duration of each performance depended upon circumstances.   The proprietors had always a fellow outside to calculate how many persons were collected for a <num value="2">second</num> exhibition, and when he thought there were enough, he came to the back of the upper seats and cried out, <QUOTE>Is Hiram Fisteman here?</QUOTE> This was a cant word between the parties, to know the state of the people without, upon which they concluded the entertainment, and dismissed the audience with a song, and prepared for a <num value="2">second</num> representation. 
<P>In a poem called <title>The New River,</title> written about <datestruct value="1725--"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>, by William Garbott, the author thus describes the Wells, with advertising enthusiasm: 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>There you may sit under the shady trees, 
<L>And drink and smoak fann'd by a gentle breeze; 
<L>Behold the fish, how wantonly they play, 
<L>And catch them also, if you please, you may.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Forcer, a barrister, the proprietor in the early part of the eighteenth century, improved the pantomimes, rope-dancing, and ladder-dancing, tumbling, and musical interludes. Acrobats threw summersaults from the upper gallery, and Black Scaramouch struggled with Harlequin on the stage. The old well was accidentally discovered in Macklin's time, between the New River and the stage-door. It was encircled with stone, and you descended to it by several steps. Cromwell, writing in <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, says that it was known that springs existed under the orchestra, and under the stage, and that the old fountain of health might hopefully be sought for there.   In <datestruct value="1738--"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>, in his <title>Evening,</title> not <num value="1">one</num> of his most successful works, Hogarth introduced a bourgeois holiday-maker and his wife, with Sadler's Wells in the background.   In <title>The Gentlemen's and Ladies' Social Companion,</title> a book of songs published in <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>-<num value="6">6</num>, we find a song on Sadler's Wells, which contained several characteristic verses. Rope-dancing and harlequinade, with scenery, feats of strength, and singing, seem to have been the usual entertainment about this period. In <datestruct value="1744--"><year reg="1744">1744</year></datestruct> the place was presented by the grand jury of the county as a scene of great extravagance, luxurious idleness, and ill-fame, but it led to no good results.   In <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct> any person was admitted   to the Wells, <QUOTE>and the diversions of the place,</QUOTE> on taking a ticket for a pint of wine. This same year a ballet on the Battle of Culloden, a most undanceable subject, <num value="1">one</num> would think, was very popular; and Hogarth's terrible <title>Harlot's Progress</title> was turned into a drama, with songs, by Lampe. 
<P>The Grub Street poets, in the meantime, belauded the Wells, not without reward, and not always inelegantly, as the following verses show:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Ye cheerful souls, who would regale 
<L>On honest home-brewed British ale,

<P>A   writer in   the <title>Connoisseur</title> of <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct> praises a dexterous performer at the Wells, who, with bells on his feet, head, and hands, jangled out a variety of tunes, by dint of various nods and jerks.   The same year a wonderful balancer named Maddox performed   on the slack wire, tossing balls, and kicking straws into a wine-glass which he held in his mouth.   Maddox, the equilibrist, entertained the public for several seasons by his <QUOTE>balances on the wire,</QUOTE> and his fame was celebrated by a song set to music, entitled <title>Balance a Straw,</title> which for a time was very popular. A   similar feat was afterwards performed at the Wells by a Dutchman, with a peacock's feather, which he blew into the air and caught as it fell, on different parts of a wire, at the same time preserving his due equilibrium.   The same performer used to balance a wheel upon his shoulder, his foreheads and his chin, and afterwards, to show his skill as an equilibrist, he poised <num value="2">two</num> wheels, with a   boy standing on <num value="1">one</num> of them. 
<P>The road home from   the Wells seems to have been   peculiarly dangerous about <datestruct value="1757--"><year reg="1757">1757</year></datestruct>, as   the manager announces in the <title>Public Advertiser</title> that on the night of a certain charitable performance a horse-patrol would be sent by Mr. Fielding (the blind magistrate, and kinsman of the novelist) for the protection of nobility and gentry who came from   the squares.   The road to the City was, as he promised, also to be properly guarded.   A year later an armed patrol was advertised as stationed on the New Road, between Sadler's Wells and Grosvenor Square.   Foote. wrote, about the same time:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>If at Sadler's Wells the wine should be thick, 
<L>The cheesecakes be sour, or Miss Wilkinson sick;

<L>We hope that you'll call at our warehouse at Drury, 
<L>We've a good assortment of goods, I assure you.</QUOTE>
 
<P>In <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct> the old wooden theatre at the Wells was pulled down and a new <num value="1">one</num> built, at an expense of <measure value="4225l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4225">4,225</num></measure>. A <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num>-shilling</measure> ticket for the boxes, in <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>, entitled the bearer to a pint of port, mountain, Lisbon, or punch A <num value="2">second</num> pint cost <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure>.. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct> Signor Grimaldi, Joe Grimaldi's father, <num value="1">first</num> appeared as chief dancer and ballet-master. He continued there till the close of <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct> James Byrne, the famous harlequin of Drury Lane, and the father of Oscar. Byrne, was employed at Sadler's Wells as a dancer, and a Signor Rossignol gave imitations of birds, like Herr Joel, and accompanied the orchestra on a fiddle without strings. About this time, too, Charles Dibdin the elder wrote some clever and fanciful pieces for this theatre, entitled <title>Intelligence from Sadler's Wells.</title>
 
<P>In <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct> Rosomon surrendered the management to King, the famous comedian, who held it till <datestruct value="1782"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, when Sheridan gave him up the sovereignty of Drury Lane. King had been an attorney, but had thrown up his parchments to join theatres and play under Garrick.   He excelled in <hi rend=italics>Sir Peter Teazle, Lord Ogleby, Puff</hi>, and <hi rend=italics>Dr. Cantwell</hi>. His 
<title>Touchstone</title> and <title>Ranger</title>, says Dr. Doran, were only equalled by Garrick and Elliston.   He was arch, easy, and versatile, and the last time he played <hi rend=italics>Sir Peter</hi>, in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, the fascinating Mrs. Jordan was the young wife.. King remained an inveterate gambler to the last, in spite of Garrick's urgent entreaties. King sold the Wells, says Mr. Pinks, for <measure value="12000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="12000">12,000</num></measure>. Joe Grimaldi appeared at Sadler's Wells <num value="1">first</num> in <datestruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct>, in the character of a monkey.   In <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct> eggdancers and performing dogs were the rage, the dogs alone clearing for the managers, in <num value="1">one</num> season, <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>. The saying at the theatre at that time was, that if the dogs had not come to the theatre, the theatre must have gone to the dogs. Horsepatrols still paraded the roads to the City at night. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct> Miss Romanzini (afterwards the celebrated ballad vocalist, Mrs. Bland) appeared at the Wells, and also Pietro Bologna, father of the celebrated clown, Jack Bologna.   In <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct> Braham, then a boy, who had <num value="1">first</num> appeared in <datestruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></datestruct>, at the Royalty Theatre, Wells Street, near Goodman's Fields, made his <num value="1">first</num> appearance at the Wells. <QUOTE><num value="2">Two</num> Frenchmen,</QUOTE> says Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE>named Duranie and Bois-Maison, as pantomimists, eclipsed all their predecessors on that stage. Boyce, a distinguished engraver, was the harlequin, and, from all accounts, was the most finished actor of the motley hero, either in his own day or since. On the benefit-night of Joseph Dortor, clown to the rope, and Richer, the rope-dancer, Miss Richer made her <num value="1">first</num> appearance on <num value="2">two</num> slack wires, passing through a hoop, with a pyramid of glasses on <pb id="P.293" n="293"> her head, and Master Richer performed on the tight rope, with a skipping-rope. Joseph Dortor, among other almost incredible feats, drank   a glass of wine backwards from the stage floor, beating a drum at the same time.   Lawrence threw a somersault over <num value="12">twelve</num> men's heads, and Paul Redige, the  <Q>Little Devil,</Q>  on <datestruct value="10-1"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=1>1st</day></datestruct>, threw a somersault over <num value="2">two</num> men on horseback, the riders having each a lighted candle on his head.   Dubois, as clown, had no superior in his time, and the troop of voltigeurs were pre-eminent for their agility, skill, and daring.</QUOTE> 
<P>After Wroughton's time, Mr. Siddons (husband of the great actress) became <num value="1">one</num> of the proprietors of the Wells, where, in <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct>, a young tragedian, Master Carey, the <QUOTE>Pupil of Nature,</QUOTE> otherwise known as Edmund Kean, recited Rollo's speech from <title>Pizarro</title>.   His great-grandfather, Henry Carey, the illegitimate son of the Marquis of Halifax, and the author of the delightful ballad, <title>Sally in our Alley,</title> had written and composed many of the ballad operas and ballad farces which were very successful at Sadler's Wells. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, Charles. Dibdin,   jun., and Thomas Dibdin, his brother, were busy at the Wells. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct> appeared Signor Belzoni, afterwards the great Egyptian traveller, as the <title>Patagonian. Samson,</title> in which character, says Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE>he performed prodigious feats of strength, <num value="1">one</num> of which was to adjust an iron frame to his body, weighing <num value="127">127</num> lbs., on which he carried <num value="11">eleven</num> persons. The frame had steps or branches projecting from its sides, on which he placed <num value="11">eleven</num> men in a pyramidical form, the uppermost of whom reached to the border of the proscenium.

This was the favourite house for the actors and authors of the Wells, and here sturdy Macklin, the best of Shylocks, Rosoman, the manager, Dibdin, and Grimaldi used to fill their churchwarden's pipes, and merrily stir their glasses. In Hogarth's <title>Evening,</title> published in <datestruct value="1738--"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>, we have a glimpse of the old signboard, and of a gable end and primitive weather-boarding, against which a vine spreads itself, and displays its clustering fruit. At an open window honest citizens are carousing, while the fat and sour City dame, of by no means unimpeachable virtue, as the painter implies, is pettishly fanning herself, attended by her obsequious Jerry Sneak of a husband, who toils along, carrying the ugly baby.   Malcolm, in <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, describes the tavern as facing the river, which was <QUOTE>adorned with tall poplars, graceful willows, and sloping banks and flowers.</QUOTE> In the <pb id="P.295" n="295"> bar of the <QUOTE>Sir Hugh Myddelton</QUOTE> is a curious old picture of Manager Rosoman, surrounded by his select friends and members of his company; and of this picture Mr. Mark Lonsdale, a once manager of the theatre, drew up the following account:--

The next, who has his fingers upon a glass of wine, is Mr. Ripley, of Red Lion Street. Mr. Cracraft, a barber in the same street, sits at his right hand, and is filling his pipe out of a paper of tobacco.   At his right hand is Mr. Holtham, scene-painter at Sadler's Wells. The gentleman who sits higher than the rest of the company, and who is in the attitude of singing, having a bottle under his arm, is Mr. Ranson, a tailor at Sadler's Wells, known by the name of Tailor Dick. Mr. Bass, a plasterer in Cow Cross, sits at his right hand, and is in the attitude of putting a punch ladle into the bowl.   At his right hand Mr. Chalkill, a poulterer in Whitecross Street.

The gentleman at Mr. Rosoman's right hand is Mr. Hough, his partner.

<P>Bagnigge Wells House was originally the summer residence of Nell Gwynne. Here, near the Fleet and amid fields, she entertained. Charles and his saturnine brother with concerts and merry breakfasts, in the careless Bohemian way in which the noble specimen of divine right delighted. The ground where the house stood was then called Bagnigge Vale. 
<P>Bagnigge House, <QUOTE>near the  <Q>Pindar of Wakefield,</Q> </QUOTE> became a place of entertainment for rusticating Londoners as early as <datestruct value="1680"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>.   It stood on the site of the present Phoenix Brewery.   The garden entrance was a little south-west of the Clerkenwell Police Court.   The gate and an inscription remained in Coppice Row, on the left, going from   Clerkenwell towards the New Road, as late as <datestruct value="1847"><year reg="1847">1847</year></datestruct>.   In the memory of man the garden still possessed fruit-trees; and at the north side stood a picturesque gable-ended house, the front luxuriously covered with vines. At the back <pb id="P.297" n="297"> stood   a small brewery.   The <QUOTE>Pinder of Wakefield</QUOTE> was an old, public-house in the Gray's Inn Road, near Chad's Well, formerly much. frequented by the wagoners of the great north road.   The Pinder of Wakefield was a jolly Yorkshireman, it will be, remembered, who once thrashed   Robin Hood himself. 
<P>About <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct> <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.297.1">Bagnigge   House</LEMMA> became famous, from   the discovery in the garden of <num value="2">two</num> mineral springs. Dr. Bevis, who wrote a pamphlet on Bagnigge Wells, describes them as near Coppice Row and Spa Fields, and about a quarter of a mile from   Battle Bridge Turnpike, and the great new road from   Paddington to Islington, and near a footpath which led--from   Southampton Row and Russell Square to Pentonville.   The doctor also mentions that over <num value="1">one</num> of the chimney pieces was the garter of St. George, the Royal arms, and a bust of <QUOTE>Eleanor Gwynne, a favourite of Charles II.'s.</QUOTE> Cromwell says that a black woman named Woolaston lived near <num value="1">one</num> of the fountains, and sold the water, and that, therefore, it was called <QUOTE>Black Mary's Hole.</QUOTE> The spring was situated, says Mr. Pinks, in the garden of No. <num value="3">3</num>, Spring Place. Close by there used to be a low public-house called <QUOTE>The Fox at Bay,</QUOTE> a resort, about <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, of footpads and highwaymen.

<P>We do not know whether the engraving appeared in a magazine or in a book giving an account of the gardens.   The <QUOTE>centre bridge</QUOTE> was, we think, the <num value="1">one</num> crossing the Fleet. The engraving represents on the left a round, railed pond, in the middle of which is the figure of a boy clasping a swan, from   the mouth of which issue <num value="6">six</num> jets 
<hi rend=italics>of</hi> water.   Round the garden are plain-looking wooden drinking bowers or boxes; and on the right are trees with tall stems and closely-cut formal foliage at the top; and also <num value="2">two</num> large figures representing a pastoral-looking man with a scythe, and a pastoral-looking woman with a hay-rake in <num value="1">one</num> hand and a bird's nest in the other. 
<P>In the old song of <title>The &lsquo;Prentice to his Mistress</title> are the following lines:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Come, prithee make it up, miss, and be as lovers be, 
<L>We'll go to Bagnigge Wells, miss, and there we'll have some tea;

<L>O! they're made of gold and silver, miss, and they wags their little tails. 
<L>O dear! O la! O dear! O la! O dear! O la! how funny!</QUOTE>
 
<P>Another engraving, published by the famous print-seller, Carrington Bowles, of St. Paul's Churchyard, represents <title>A Bagnigge Wells Scene ; or, No Resisting Temptation.</title>   The scene is laid in the gardens, close by the boy and swan fountain; and <pb id="P.298" n="298"> a young lady, in an elaborate old-fashioned headdress, and a gaily-trimmed petticoat and long skirt, is plucking a rose from <num value="1">one</num> of the flower-beds, while another damsel of corresponding elegance looks on. 
<P>A mezzotint, also published by Bowles, in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, shows <title>The Bread and Butter Manufactory; or, the Humours of Bagnigge Wells.</title>   This plate, which is in size <num value="14">fourteen</num> inches by <num value="10">ten</num>, and represents several parties of anciently-dressed ladies and gentlemen, and a boy-waiter with a tray of cups and saucers, was hung up, framed and glazed, in the bar of Old Bagnigge Wells House.

Over the gate, on a board, are the words <QUOTE>Bagnigge Wells.</QUOTE> Mr. Deputy Dumpling is a very short, fat man, wearing a wig, perspiring freely, and carrying a child. His wife, who is also short and fat, is walking behind him, with an open fan and his walking-stick.   Beside them   is a boy, dragging a perambulator of the period, in which is a girl with a doll. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, a curious aquatinta print of Bagnigge Wells, from   a painting by Saunders, was published by J. R. Smith. It represents the interior of the long room, filled with a gay and numerous company, attired in the fashion of the period. Some are promenading, others are seated at tables partaking of tea. The room is lighted by brazen sconces of wax lights, hanging from the ceiling, and the organ is visible at the distant end. The artist has, after the manner of Hogarth, well depicted the humours of the motley company who are quizzing <num value="1">one</num> another, and being ogled in turn. The prominent feature of the sketch is a richlybedizened madam on the arm of a gallant, who is receiving a polite salute from an officer, by whom she is recognised, at which her companion seems to be somewhat chagrined. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, Bagnigge Wells boasted a central temple, a grotto stuck with sea-shells and broken glass, alcoves, &amp;c.

<P>The oldest portion of the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.298.1">Coldbath Fields Prison</LEMMA>
 now standing was built on a swamp, in <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, at an expense of <measure value="65650l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="65650">65,650</num></measure>, and large additions have from time to time been made.   For a long time after it was rebuilt, Coldbath Fields had a reputation for severity. In <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct> Gilbert Wakefield, the classic, expressed a morbid horror of it; and Coleridge and Southey, many years later, in <title>The Devil's Walk,</title> published their opinion that it exceeded hell itself, as a place of punishment:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>As he went through Coldbath Fields he saw 
<L>A solitary cell; 
<L>And the Devil was pleased, for it gave him a hint 
<L>For improving his prisons in hell.</QUOTE>
 
<P>In <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct> Thistlewood and the other Cato Street conspirators were lodged here, before being sent to the Tower. At present the prison has proper accommodation for about <num value="1250">1,250</num> prisoners, though many more are sometimes thrust into it, causing great confusion. 
<P>The prison, built on <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.299.1">a plan</LEMMA> of the benevolent Howard's, soon became a scene of great abuses. Men, women, and boys were herded together in this chief county prison, and smoking and drinking were permitted.   The governor of the day strove vigorously to reform the hydra abuses, and especially the tyranny and greediness of the turnkeys. <num value="5">Five</num> years later he introduced stern silence into his domain. <QUOTE>On the <datestruct VALUE="1834-12-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, a population of <num value="914">914</num> prisoners were suddenly apprised that all intercommunication, by word, gesture, or sign, was prohibited.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>This is what is called the Silent Associated System. The treadmill had been introduced at Coldbath Fields several years before. This apparatus, the invention of Mr. Cubitt, an engineer at Lowestoft, was <pb id="P.299" n="299"> <num value="1">first</num> set up,</QUOTE> says. Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE>at Brixton Prison, in <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>.   At <num value="1">first</num>, the allowance was <num value="12000">12,000</num> feet of ascent, but was soon reduced to <num value="1200">1,200</num>.</QUOTE> 
<P>This desolate prison has made a solitude of the immediate neighbourhood, but not far off brassfounders, grocers' canister makers, and such like abound. 
<P>The dismal Bastille has frequently been enlarged. In <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct> a vagrants' ward for <num value="150">150</num> prisoners was added, and shortly afterwards a female ward for <num value="300">300</num> inmates. Coldbath Fields is now devoted to male prisoners alone, the females having been removed from it to Westminster Prison in <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>.   The treadmill finds labour for <num value="160">160</num> prisoners at a time and grinds flour.   The ordinary annual charge for each prisoner is estimated at <measure value="21l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="21">21</num></measure> <measure value="19s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="19">19</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> The Report of the Inspector of Prisons for <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct> speaks of the Coldbath Fields cells as too crowded and badly ventilated, the prisoners being sometimes <num value="700">700</num> or <num value="800">800</num> in excess of the number of cells, and sleeping either in hammocks slung too close together in dormitories, or, still worse, on the floors of workshops, only a short time before emptied of the working inmates. 
<P>John Hunt, Leigh   Hunt's brother, was imprisoned here for a libel, in the <title>Examiner</title>, on the Prince Regent,   the <QUOTE>fat Adonis,</QUOTE> afterwards George IV. Mr. Cyrus Redding, Campbell's friend, used to come and chat and play chess with him. He had a lofty and comfortable, though small apartment at the top of the prison. Townsend, the old Bow Street runner, the terror of highwaymen, was the governor at the time. Hunt had the privilege from the kind, shrewd old officer, of walking for a couple of hours daily in the governor's gardens. 
<P> <QUOTE>Leaving the oakum   room,</QUOTE> says Mr. Dixon, writing about this prison in <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>we enter the body of the original building. It consists of <num value="4">four</num> long galleries, forming a parallelogram by their junction on the sides of which are ranged the cells. If the system on which the prison is ostensibly conducted were rigorously carried out, all the prisoners would be separated at night; but the number of separate cells is only <num value="550">550</num>, while the inmates often amount to upwards of <num value="1300">1,300</num>. The surplus is, therefore, to be provided for in general dormitories, in which officers are obliged to remain all night to prevent intercourse or disorder. 
<P>It is in the midst of passions like these, seething in the hearts of <num value="1200">1,200</num> criminals, not separately confined as at Pentonville, that the administration of this vast prison has to be conducted. The official staff consists of the governor, <num value="2">2</num> chaplains, <num value="1">1</num> surgeon, <num value="3">3</num> trade instructors, and <num value="134">134</num> assistant officers; in all <num value="141">141</num> persons: a corps rather too small than too large, considering the nature of the duties devolving upon it.   Without system, or without a system rigorously administered, it. would be impossible to maintain order in such a place, unless each individual was kept under lock and key, as in the neighbouring House of Detention. 
<P>Passing through an inner gate to the left, we come upon a yard in which   we   find a number of prisoners taking walking   exercise, marching in regular order and perfect <hi rend=italics>silence</hi>. All of these are habited in the prison uniform, a good warm dress of coarse woollen cloth; the misdemeanants in blue, the felons in dark grey. Each prisoner wears a large number on his back, which number constitutes his prison name and designation, proper names not being used in this gaol. Every kind of personality that can possibly be sunk is sunk. The subordinate officers of the prison seldom know anything of the real name, station, crime, connections, or antecedents of the person who is placed under their charge; and this kind of knowledge, except in rare cases indeed, never comes to the ears of fellow-culprits while within the walls of the prison.   Some of the men, it will also be noticed, bear stars upon their arms; these are marks of good conduct, of great value to the wearer when in the gaol, and entitling him to a certain allowance on discharge, varying according to circumstances from <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure> to a pound. These allowances are often the salvation of offenders.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Coldbath Square derives its chief name, says Mr. Pinks, from a celebrated cold bath, the best known in London, fed by a spring which was discovered by a Mr. Baynes, in <datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>.   The active discoverer declared the water had great power in nervous diseases, and equalled those of St. Magnus and St. Winnifred. In Mr. Baynes's advertisement in the <title>Post Bag</title> he asserts that his cold bath <QUOTE>prevents and cures cold, creates appetite, helps digestion, and makes hardy the tenderest constitution.   The coach-way is by Hockley-in-the- Hole.</QUOTE> The bath is described as <QUOTE>in Sir John Oldcastle's field, near the north end of Gray's Inn Lane.</QUOTE> The bathing-hours were from <num value="5">five</num> a.m. to <num value="1">one</num>, the charge <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure>, unless the visitor was so infirm   as to need to be let down into this Cockney Pool of Bethesda in a chair. Mr. Baynes died in <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>, and was buried in the old church of St. James's.   He was originally a student of the Middle Temple, and was for <num value="15">fifteen</num> years treasurer of St. James's Charity School. The old bath-house was a building with <num value="3">three</num> gables, and had a large garden with <num value="4">four</num> turret summer-houses.   In <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct> the trustees of the London Fever Hospital bought <pb id="P.300" n="300"> the property for <measure value="3830l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3830">3,830</num></measure>, but, being driven away by the frightened inhabitants, the ground was sold for building, the bath remaining. 
<P>In Coldbath Square, near the Cold Bath, Eustace Budgell, a relation of Addison, resided in <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>. 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.300.1">Budgell</LEMMA>, who wrote many articles in the <title>Spectator,</title>
 was pushed into good Government work by his kinsman, Addison, but eventually ruined himself by the South Sea Bubble and litigation. Budgell having helped Dr. Tindal in the publication of <num value="1">one</num> of his infidel works, was in consequence left by the doctor <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>.   There arose, however, a suspicion of fraud, and the will was set aside. Pope did not forget the scandal, in attacking his enemies- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Let Budgell charge even Grub Street on my bill,

 This disgrace seems to have turned Budgell's brain. He took a boat, <datestruct value="05-1"><day reg="1">one</day> <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>-day, at Somerset Stairs, having <num value="1">first</num> filled his pockets with stones, and vainly tried to decoy his little daughter with him. While the boat was shooting London Bridge Budgell leaped out, and was drowned. Budgell's best epigram was on some persons who danced detestably to good music-

She generally wore silk gowns, with the train long, a deep flounce all round, and a very long waist. Her gown was very tightly laced up to her neck, round which was a kind of ruff, or frill. The sleeves came down below the elbows, and to each of them <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> large cuffs were attached. A large bonnet, quite flat, high-heeled shoes, a large black silk cloak trimmed round with lace, and a gold-headed cane, completed her everyday costume for the last <num value="80">eighty</num> years, in which dress she walked round the square. She never washed herself, because she thought those people who did so were <pb id="P.301" n="301"> always taking cold, or laying the foundation of some dreadful disorder. Her method was to besmear her face and neck all over with hog's-lard, because that was soft and lubricating; and then, because she wanted a little colour on her cheeks, she bedaubed them with rose-pink. Her manner of living was so methodical, that she would not drink tea out of any other than a favourite cup.   At breakfast she arranged in a particular way the paraphernalia of the tea-table, and dinner the same. She observed a general rule, and always sat in her favourite chair. She enjoyed good health, and entertained the greatest aversion to medicine. At the age of eightyseven she cut <num value="2">two</num> new teeth, and she was never troubled with the toothache.   She lived in <num value="5">five</num>

The sudden death of an old lady who was a near neighbour made a deep impression on Mrs. Lewson.

<P> <QUOTE>In former times,</QUOTE> says Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>the district around the chapel known as Spa Fields, or the Ducking-pond Fields, now intersected by streets of well-built houses, was the summer's evening resort <pb id="P.302" n="302"> of the townspeople, who came hither to witness the rude sports that were in vogue a century ago, such as duck-hunting, prize-fighting, bull-baiting, and others of an equally demoralising character. We are informed by an old newspaper that in <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct>  <Q><num value="2">Two</num> women fought for a new shift, valued at halfa-crown, in the Spaw Fields, near Islington.

<P>About the middle of the last century it was dangerous to cross these fields in the dusk of evening, robberies being frequent, and the persons filched were often grievously maltreated by the villains who waylaid them.</QUOTE>

It was about this dangerous time that link-boys were in constant attendance at the door of Sadler's Wells, to light persons home returning by the lonely fields to the streets of Islington, Clerkenwell, or Holborn.

<P>In <datestruct value="1779--"><year reg="1779">1779</year></datestruct> appeared in the <title>Clerkenwell Chronicle</title>
 the following notice of sports which took place in Spa Fieds :--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>On Friday, some bricklayers enclosed a piece of ground <num value="10">ten</num> feet by <num value="6">six</num>, for roasting the ox; and so substantial was the brickwork that several persons sat up all night to watch that it did not fall to pieces before the morning. An hour before sunrising the fire was lighted for roasting the ox, which was brought in a cart from St. James's Market. At <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock the ox was laid over the fire in remembrance of the cruelty of the Spaniards in their conquest of Mexico. By <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock <num value="1">one</num> of the legs was ready to drop off, but no satire on the American colonies was intended; for if it had fallen there were numbers ready to have swallowed it. At <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock came a sergeant and a number of deputy Sons of the Sword. The sergeant made an elegant speech, at which every <num value="1">one</num> gaped in astonishment, because no <num value="1">one</num> could understand it. At half-past <num value="2">two</num> the beef was taken up, slices cut up and thrown among the crowd, and many and many a <num value="1">one</num> catched his hat full to fill his belly. 
<P>Instead of <num value="4">four</num> old women to run for the gown, &amp;c., there were only <num value="3">three</num> girls, and the race was won without running; for <num value="2">two</num> of the adventurers gave out before half the contest was over, and even the winner was a loser, for she tore off the sleeve of her gown in attempting to get it on.   Only <num value="1">one</num> man grinned for the tobacco, gin, &amp;c. But it was enough. Ugliness is no word to express the diabolicality of his phiz. If the king had <num value="10">ten</num> such subjects he might fear they would grin for the crown.   Addison tells us of a famous grinner who threw his face into the shape of the head of a base viol, of a hat, of the mouth of a coffee-pot, and the nozzle of a pair of bellows; but Addison's grinner was nothing to the present, who must have been born grinning.   His mother must have studied geometry, have longed for curves and angles, and stamped them all on the face of the boy. The mob was so immense that, though the tide was constantly ebbing and flowing, it was supposed the average number was <num value="4000">4,000</num> from <num value="9">nine</num> in the morning till <num value="8">eight</num> at night; and as this account is not exaggerated, <num value="44000">44,000</num> people must have been present. All the ale-houses for half a mile round were crowded, the windows were lined, and the tops and gutters of the houses filled. The place was at once a market and a fair; curds and whey were turned sour, ripe filberts were hardened, and extempore oysters baked in the sun.   The bread intended for the loyal was thrown about the fields <pb id="P.303" n="303"> by the malcontents. The beer was drunk out of pots without measure and without number; but <num value="1">one</num> man who could not get liquor swore he would eat if he could not drink His Majesty's health; and observing an officer with a piece of beef on the point of his sword, he made prize of it, and ate it in the true cannibal taste. 
<P>The feast, on the whole, was conducted with great regularity; for if <num value="1">one</num> got meat another got bread only, and the whole was consumed; but to add to the farce a person threw a basket of onions among the bread-eaters. Some men were enlisted as soldiers, but more were impressed, for the bloodhounds were on the scent, and ran breast-high. If not spring-guns, it might fairly be said that mentraps had been fixed in the Spa Fields. The beef was good of its kind, but like the constitution of Old England, more than half spoiled by bad cooks.</QUOTE>
 
<P>The Ducking-pond Fields, Clerkenwell Fields, Spa Fields, and Pipe Fields, were <num value="1">one</num> and the same place, under different names. The oldest of these names was. the <num value="1">first</num>, which applied especially to the district surrounding Spa Fields Chapel, and extending to the northward.   The Pipe Fields were so called from the wooden pipes (merely elm-trees perforated) of the New River Company mentioned by Britton about the close of last century. 
<P>The building, afterwards <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.303.1">Spa Fields Chapel</LEMMA>, on the south side of Exmouth Street, was originally opened in <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, as a place of public amusement. The <QUOTE>Pantheon,</QUOTE> as it was called, soon became disreputable. It is described by a contemporary as a large round building crowned by a statue of Fame. In the inside were <num value="2">two</num> galleries. There was a garden with fancy walks, classical statues, and boxes for tea-parties, wine-drinkers, and negussippers.   The company, as might be supposed, consisted chiefly of small tradesmen, apprentices, dressmakers, servant-girls, and disreputable women. This building had been preceded by a small country inn, with swinging sign, and a long railed--in pond, where citizens used to come and send in their water-dogs to chase ducks. In this ducking-pond <num value="6">six</num> children were drowned in <datestruct value="1683--"><year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>, while playing on the ice. The Spa Fields Pantheon proprietor became bankrupt in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, and the house and gardens, which had cost the speculator <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure>, were sold. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct> <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.303.2">Selina,   the zealous Countess of Huntingdon</LEMMA>, consulted Toplady as to purchasing the Pantheon for a chapel, but was dissuaded from the attempt. It was then taken by a company, and opened as a Church of England chapel, in <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct>, but the Rev. William   Sellon, incumbent of St. James's, Clerkenwell, being refused the pew-rents, compelled the proprietors to close it. Eventually the Countess of Huntingdon purchased it, but Mr. Sellon again obtained a verdict in a law-court, and stopped all further services. The countess then turned it into a Dissenting chapel, and <num value="2">two</num> of her curates seceded from the Established Church, and took the oath of allegiance as Dissenting ministers. The Gordon rioters of <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct> threatened to destroy it, but did not, when they heard it belonged to the good countess. Shrubsole, the organist in the Spa Fields Chapel, was the composer of that beautiful hymn, <QUOTE>All hail the power of Jesu's name.</QUOTE> The Rev. T. E. Thoresby accepted the pastorate in <datestruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct>.   The fine building will hold more than <num value="2000">2,000</num> persons, and was for many years <num value="1">one</num> of the wealthiest and most influential Dissenting chapels in London. 
<P>The Spa Fields Charity School was established in <datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct> by the good countess before mentioned, and new school-rooms were built in <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct> on the site of the countess's garden. 
<P>The Countess of Huntingdon herself lived in a large house covered with jasmine, once a part of the old Pantheon tea-gardens, and standing on the east side of the chapel. This lady, who did so much to benefit a godless age, was born in <datestruct value="1707--"><year reg="1707">1707</year></datestruct> (Queen Anne), and died in <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct> (George III.) She married the Earl of Huntingdon in <datestruct value="1728--"><year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct>. Both by birth and marriage she was connected, says her chaplain, Dr. Haweis, with English kings. Her profound impressions of religion seem to have commenced in early infancy, at the funeral of a child of her own age. A severe illness in later life, and conversation with her sister-in-law, Lady Margaret Hastings, a convert to Methodism, still more affected her. She went to court, but soon married a serious nobleman, and devoted herself to her true profession--not the mere encouragement of milliners, but the study of doing good. 
<P> <QUOTE>Bishop Benson,</QUOTE> says Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE>was sent for by her husband to reason with her ladyship on her changed religious views, but she pressed upon him so hard with articles and homilies, and so urged upon him the awful responsibility of his station, that his temper was ruffled, and he rose up in haste to depart, bitterly lamenting that he had ever laid his hands on George Whitefield, to whom he imputed the change. She called him   back, saying,  <Q>My lord, when you come to your dying bed that will be <num value="1">one</num> of the few ordinations you will reflect upon with complacence.</Q>  The Prince of Wales <num value="1">one</num> day at court asked a lady of fashion where my Lady   Huntingdon   was, that she seldom <pb id="P.304" n="304"> visited the city.

<P>This great <QUOTE>seer</QUOTE> was the son of a Swedish bishop, and was born in <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>.   As a child his thoughts turned chiefly on religion. At the University of Upsala the lad steadily studied the classical languages, mathematics and natural philosophy, and at the age of <num value="22">twenty-two</num> took his degree as a doctor of philosophy, and published his <num value="1">first</num> essay. In <datestruct value="1710--"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct> the young student came to London, when the plague prevailed in. Sweden, and narrowly escaped being hung for breaking the quarantine laws. He spent some time at Oxford, and then went abroad for <num value="3">three</num> years, living chiefly in Utrecht, Paris, and Griefswalde. He returned to Sweden in <datestruct value="1714--"><year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct> through Stralsund, which that valiant madman, Charles XII., was just then besieging. Introduced to the chivalrous king in <datestruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>, he was made Assessor to the Board of Mines. During the siege of Frederickshall Swedenborg <QUOTE>rendered important service by transporting over mountains and valleys, on rolling machines of his own invention, <num value="2">two</num> galleys, <num value="5">five</num> large boats, and a sloop, from Stromstadt to Iderfjol, a distance of <num value="14">fourteen</num> miles.

He retired from his office of assessor in <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct>, and probably then returned to his theological contemplations, and became again a Spiritualistic dreamer. He came from Amsterdam to London in <datestruct value="1771--"><year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct>, and resided at Shearsmith's, a peruke-maker's, No. <num value="26">26</num>, Great Bath Street, Coldbath Fields, where he finished his <title>True Christian Religion.</title>   Towards the end of the year Dr. Hartley and Mr. Cookworthy visited him in Clerkenwell. <QUOTE>The details of the the interview,</QUOTE> says Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>are not given, but we gather enough to show   his innocence and simplicity, for on their inviting him to dine with them he politely excused himself, adding that his dinner was already prepared, which dinner proved to be a meal of bread and milk. On Christmas Eve, <datestruct value="1771"><year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct>, a stroke of apoplexy deprived him for a time of speech. Towards the end of <datestruct VALUE="1772-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, the Rev. John Wesley was in conclave with some of his preachers, when a Latin note was put into his hand. It caused him evident astonishment, for the substance of it was as follows:

<P>Wesley frankly acknowledged that he had been strongly impressed with a desire to see him, but that he had not mentioned that desire to any <num value="1">one</num>. He wrote an answer that he was then preparing for a <num value="6">six</num>-months' journey, but he would wait upon Swedenborg on his return to London. Swedenborg wrote in reply that he should go into the world of spirits on the <num value="29">29th</num> of the then next month, never more to return. The consequence was that these <num value="2">two</num> remarkable persons never met.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Swedenborg professed to the last the entire truth of all his strange revelations of heaven and hell, and died on the day he had predicted to Wesley. <pb id="P.305" n="305"> After lying in state for several days at the undertaker's, he was buried in the Lutheran Chapel, Princes' Square, Ratcliff Highway, and his coffin lies by the side of that of Captain Cook's friend, Dr. Solander, the naturalist. 
<P> <QUOTE>In person,</QUOTE> says Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE>Swedenborg was about <num value="5">five</num> feet <num value="9">nine</num> inches in height, rather thin, and of brown complexion; his eyes were of a brownishgrey, nearly hazel, and rather small; he had always a cheerful smile upon his countenance.   His suit, according to Shearsmith, was made after an old fashion; he wore a full-bottomed wig, a pair of long ruffles, and a curious-hilted sword and he carried a gold-headed cane. In diet he was a vegetarian, and he abstained from alcoholic liquors. He paid little attention to times and seasons for sleep, and he often laboured through the night, and sometimes continued in bed several days together, while enjoying his spiritual trances.   He   desired Shearsmith never to disturb him at such times, an injunction which was necessary, for the look of his face was so peculiar on those occasions, that Shearsmith thought he was dead.</QUOTE> 
<P>Soon after Spa Fields Chapel was opened, in <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct>, some speculators leased of the Marquis of Northampton the <num value="2">two</num> acres of ground in the rear of the building, and converted it into a general burying-ground.   The new cemetery, embedded among houses, was intended to bring in a pretty penny, as it was calculated to have room for <num value="2722">2,722</num> adults, but it soon began to fill at the rate of <num value="1500">1,500</num> bodies annually, there being sometimes <num value="36">thirty-six</num> burials a day. In <num value="50">fifty</num> years it was carefully computed that <num value="80000">80,000</num> interments had taken place in this pestilential graveyard! in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct> some terrible disclosures began to ooze out, proving the shameless greediness of the human ghouls who farmed the Spa Fields burial-ground. It was found that it was now the nightly custom to exhume bodies and burn the coffins, to make room   for fresh arrivals. To make the new grave <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> bodies were actually chopped up, and corpses recently interred were frequently dragged up by ropes, so that the coffin might be removed and split up for struts to prop up the new-made graves. Bodies were sometimes destroyed after only <num value="2">two</num> days' burial. A grave-digger who, being discharged, insisted on removing the body of his child, which had been recently interred, declared that he and his mates had buried as many as <num value="45">forty-five</num> bodies in <num value="1">one</num> day, besides still-borns. In <num value="1">one</num> year they had had <num value="2017">2,017</num> funerals, and the stones of families who had purchased graves in perpetuity were frequently displaced and destroyed. The inhabitants of the neighbourhood then petitioned Parliament, complaining of the infectious smells from the burialground, and of the shameful scandal generally. 
<P> <QUOTE>The lessees of the ground,</QUOTE> says the historian of Clerkenwell, <QUOTE>sought to allay the general excitement by repudiating the charges brought against their underlings, but there was no mitigation of the evil complained of; nightly burnings still took place.

By the exertions of Mr. G. A. Walker, M.D., of the Society for the Abolition of Burials in Towns, seconded by several of the principal inhabitants, this disgraceful state of things was brought again under the attention of the magistrates, and the lessees, managers, and others were summoned to appear at the Clerkenwell Police Court, when other revolting statements were made and confirmed.

<P>This place was formerly <num value="1">one</num> of those infamous localities only equalled by Tothill Fields, at Westminster, and Saffron Hill, in the valley of the Fleet. It was the resort of thieves, highwaymen, and bullbaiters. Its site was marked by Ray Street, itself almost demolished by the Clerkenwell improvements of <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>-<num value="7">7</num>. The ill-omened name of Hockleyin-the-Hole seems to have been derived from the frequent overflows of the Fleet.

In <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct> this wretched locality was narrow, and surrounded by ruinous houses, but the road was soon after widened, raised, and drained. In <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct> the navvies came upon an old pavement near Ray Street, and oak piles, black and slimy, the site of a City mill.

<P>On the site of the <QUOTE>Coach and Horses,</QUOTE> in Ray Street, once stood the Bear Garden of Hockleyin- the-Hole, which, in Queen Anne's time, rivalled the Southwark Bear Garden of Elizabethan days.

<P>The House of Detention, Clerkenwell, a place of imprisonment as old as   <datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>, was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, and also in <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>. This prison was the scene, in <datestruct VALUE="1867-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct>, of that daring attempt to rescue the Fenian prisoners, Burke and Casey, which for a day or <num value="2">two</num> scared London. 
<P> <QUOTE>In the course of the day,</QUOTE> says a writer in the <title>Annual Register</title>, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>a policeman on duty outside the prison had his suspicions so strongly aroused, by seeing a woman named Justice and a man frequently conversing together, that he communicated with <num value="1">one</num> of the prison authorities, who, in consequence, made arrangements for giving an alarm, if it should become necessary.   During the day, a warder on duty inside had his attention directed to a man at a window in the upper part of a house in Woodbridge Street, overlooking the prison-yard.   He went to bring another warder, and on their return the man had vanished, but was shortly afterwards seen talking to the woman Justice near the entrance to the prison, and to the man who had been seen loitering with her.   Later in the day, the warder had his attention called to the same window in the opposite house in Woodbridge Street, overlooking the prison-yard; and there he saw a woman leaning out, and several men inside the room. He distinctly counted <num value="5">five</num> men; but there seemed to him to be more, and they were all looking anxiously in the direction of the place where the explosion occurred almost immediately afterwards. 
<P>The explosion, which sounded like a discharge of artillery, occurred at exactly a quarter to <num value="4">four</num> o'clock in the afternoon, when there was still some daylight, and was heard for miles round. In the immediate neighbourhood it produced the greatest consternation; for it blew down houses, and shattered the windows of others in all directions.   A considerable length of the outer wall of the prison was levelled with the ground.   The windows of the prison, of coarse glass more than a quarter of an inch thick, were, to a large extent, broken, and the side of the building immediately facing the outer wall in which the breach was made, and about <num value="150">150</num> feet from it, showed the marks of the bricks which were hurled against it by the explosion. The wall surrounding the prison was about twentyfive feet high, <num value="2">two</num> feet <num value="3">three</num> inches thick at the bottom, and about <num value="14">fourteen</num> inches thick at the top. 
<P>The result of the explosion upon the unfortunate inmates of the houses in Corporation Lane and other adjoining buildings was most disastrous.

<P>Several persons were arrested as having been <pb id="P.310" n="310"> implicated in the crime, and tried at the Central Criminal Court.

<P>The legends and traditions of this most ancient and interesting district of London all cluster round 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.310.1">St. John's Gate</LEMMA> (the old south gate of the priory of St. John of Jerusalem), and the old crypt of St. John's Church, relics of old religion and of ancient glory. 
<P>For upwards of <num value="400">four hundred</num> years <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.310.2">the Knights Hospitallers flourished in Clerkenwell</LEMMA>, and a brief note of their origin here becomes indispensable. The order seems to have had its rise in the middle of the <num value="11">eleventh</num> century, when some pious merchants of Amalfi obtained leave of the Mohammedans to build a refuge for sick and needy Christian pilgrims, near the church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. The hospital was dedicated to St. John the Cypriote, Patriarch of Alexandria, a good man, who, in the <num value="7">seventh</num> century, when the Saracens <num value="1">first</num> took Jerusalem, had generously sent money and food to the afflicted Christians of Syria. Subsequently the order renounced John the Patriarch, and took up with the more agreeable patronage of St. John the Baptist. 
<P>In the <num value="1">first</num> crusade, when the overwhelming forces of Christian Europe forced their way into the Holy City, and the streets which Christ had trodden, scattering blessings, floated in infidel blood, the hospital of St. John was filled with wounded Crusaders, many of whom, on their recovery, doffed their mail and put on the robes of the holy and charitable brotherhood. The real founder of the order was Gerard, who, when Godfrey de Bouillon was chosen King of Jerusalem, in <datestruct value="1099--"><year reg="1099">1099</year></datestruct>, proposed to the brethren a regular costume, and became the <num value="1">first</num> rector or master of the order. The dress formally adopted, in <datestruct value="1104--"><year reg="1104">1104</year></datestruct>, was a black robe and white cross. Raymond de Pay, who succeeded Gerard, took a bolder step. Tired of merely feeding and nursing sick and hungry pilgrims, he proposed to his brethren to make the order a military <num value="1">one</num>. By   <num value="130">130</num> this section of the church militant had whipped off hundreds of shaven heads, and covered themselves with glory. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1187--"><year reg="1187">1187</year></datestruct>, when Saladin retook Jerusalem, he was gracious to the Hospitallers, who had been kind to the wounded and the prisoners, and he allowed <num value="10">ten</num> of the order to remain and complete their cures. Still indefatigable against the unbelievers, the men of the black robe and white cross fought bravely at the taking of Ptolemais, in <datestruct value="1191--"><year reg="1191">1191</year></datestruct>, and from them this strong seaport town, which they held for nearly <num value="2">two</num> centuries, derived its new name of St. Jean d&lsquo;Acre. 
<P>Siege and battle, desert march and hill fights, had, however, now thinned the black mantles, and more men had to be sent out to recruit the little army of muscular Christians.   The departure of the reinforcement from   Clerkenwell Priory is thus picturesquely described by the old monkish chronicler, Matthew Paris:-- <QUOTE>In <datestruct value="1237--"><year reg="1237">1237</year></datestruct> the Hos. pitallers sent their prior, Theodoric, a German by birth, and a most clever knight, with a body of other knights and stipendiary attendants, and a large sum of money, to the assistance of the Holy Land. They having made all arrangements, set out from their house at Clerkenwell, and proceeded in good order, with about <num value="30">thirty</num> shields uncovered, with spears raised, and preceded by their banner, through the midst of the City, towards the bridge, that they might obtain the blessings of the spectators, and, bowing their heads with their cowls lowered, commended themselves to the prayers of all.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>It is said,</QUOTE> says <num value="1">one</num> writer, <QUOTE>that on the return of the English Crusaders to their native country, the Knights Hospitallers and Knights Templars, on the <datestruct VALUE="1247-10-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1247">1247</year></datestruct>, presented King Henry III. with a beautiful crystalline vase,. containing a portion of the blood of our Saviour that he had shed on the cross for the salvation of mankind, the genuineness of the relic being attested by the seals of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, and the archbishops, bishops, abbots, and other prelates of the Holy Land.</QUOTE> 
<P>In <datestruct value="1292--"><year reg="1292">1292</year></datestruct>, at the desperate siege of Acre, the fighting of straight sword against sabre was so hot, <pb id="P.311" n="311"> and such were the falls from roof and battlement, that only <num value="7">seven</num> of the Syrian detachment escaped to Cyprus. In <datestruct value="1310--"><year reg="1310">1310</year></datestruct> the Hospitallers conquered Rhodes and <num value="7">seven</num> other islands from the Infidel, and commenced privateering against all Mohammedan vessels. In <datestruct value="1344--"><year reg="1344">1344</year></datestruct> these stalwart Christians took Smyrna, which post they held for <num value="56">fifty-six</num> years, till they were forced out of the stronghold by Tamerlane. Rhodes becoming an unbearable thorn in the flesh to turbaned mariners, in <datestruct value="1444--"><year reg="1444">1444</year></datestruct>, an army of <num value="18000">18,000</num> Turks besieged the island for <num value="40">forty</num> days, but in vain.   In <datestruct value="1492--"><year reg="1492">1492</year></datestruct> Mahomet II. was repulsed, after a siege of <num value="89">eighty-nine</num> days, leaving <num value="9000">9,000</num> shaven Infidels dead around the ramparts. In <datestruct value="1502--"><year reg="1502">1502</year></datestruct> cautious Henry VII. of England was chosen Protector of the order, and promised men and money against the scorners of Christianity, but supplied neither. But the end came at last; in <datestruct value="1522--"><year reg="1522">1522</year></datestruct> Solyman the Magnificent besieged Rhodes with <num value="300000">300,000</num> men, and eventually, after a stubborn <num value="4">four</num> months' siege, and the loss of <num value="80000">80,000</num> men by violence, and as many by disease, the brave grand master, L&lsquo;Isle Adam, after his honourable capitulation, came to England to appeal to Henry VIII., whose fat, greedy hand was already stretched out towards the Clerkenwell Priory. The order had done its duty, and Henry was touched by the venerable old warrior's appeal: he confirmed the privileges of the knights, and gave L&lsquo;Isle Adam a golden basin and ewer, set with jewels, and artillery to the value of <num value="20000">20,000</num> crowns. The recovery of Rhodes was not, however, attempted by the Hospitallers, as the Emperor Charles V. ceded Malta to them on the annual payment of a falcon to the reigning King of Spain. 
<P>The generous concessions of Henry VIII. lasted only as long as the tyrant's purse was full. Having little to say against the Clerkenwell knights, he suppressed the order because it <QUOTE>maliciously and traitorously upheld the  <Q>Bishop of Rome</Q>  to be Supreme Head   of Christ's Church,</QUOTE> intending thereby to subvert <QUOTE>the good and godly laws and statues of this realm.</QUOTE> William Weston, the last prior, and other officers of the order, were bought off by small annuities. Fuller particularly mentions that the Knights Hospitallers, <QUOTE>being gentlemen and soldiers of ancient families and high spirits,</QUOTE> would not present the king with puling petitions, but stood bravely on their rights. They judged it best, however, to submit.   Some of the knights retired to Malta.   <num value="2">Two</num> who remained were beheaded as traitors to King Henry, and a <num value="3">third</num> was hanged and quartered.   Queen Mary restored the order to their possessions, but Elizabeth again drove off the knights to Malta. 
<P> <QUOTE>The rules and privileges of the order of the Knights of St. John,</QUOTE> says Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>were as follows. Raymond de Pay made the following rules, which were confirmed by Pope Boniface, in the <num value="6">sixth</num> year of his pontificate :--Poverty, chastity, and obedience; to expect but bread and water and a coarse garment. The clerks to serve in white surplices at the altar.   The priests in their surplices to convey the Host to the sick, with a deacon or clerk preceding them bearing a lantern, and a sponge filled with holy water. The brethren to go abroad by the appointment of the master, but never singly; and, to avoid giving offence, no females to be employed for or about their persons. When soliciting alms, to visit churches, or people of reputation, and ask their food for charity; if they received none, to buy enough for subsistence. To account for all their receipts to the master, and he to give them to the poor, retaining only <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3">third</num> part for provisions, the overplus to the poor. The brethren to go soliciting only by permission, to carry candles with them, to wear no skins of wild beasts, or clothes degrading to the order. To eat but twice a day on Wednesday and Saturday, and no flesh from Septuagesima until Easter, except when aged or indisposed. To sleep covered. If incontinent in private, to repent in privacy, and do penance. If the brother was discovered, he was to be deprived of his robe in the church of the town after mass, severely whipped, and expelled from   the order, but if truly penitent, he might be again received, but not without penance, and a year's expulsion. If <num value="2">two</num> of the brethren quarrelled, they were to eat only bread and water on Wednesday and Friday, and off the bare ground for <num value="7">seven</num> days. If blows passed,   and to those who went abroad without permission, this discipline was extended to <num value="40">forty</num> days. No conversation when eating, or after retiring to the dormitory, and nothing to be drunk after the ringing of the compline. If a brother offended, and did not amend after the <num value="3">third</num> admonition, he was compelled to walk to the master for correction. No brother was to strike a servant. The <num value="22">twenty-second</num> rule of this monastic code was both revolting and disgraceful to any community. It ordered that if a brother died without revealing what he possessed, his money should be tied about the body's neck, and it was to be severely whipped in the presence of the members of the house.   Masses were sung <num value="30">thirty</num> days for deceased brethren and alms given in the house.   In all decisions they were to give just judgment. They sung the epistle and gospel on Sundays, made a procession, and sprinkled holy water. If a brother embezzled money appropriated to the poor, or excited opposition <pb id="P.312" n="312"> to the master, he was expelled. When a brother's conduct was found to be too bad, another was to reprove him, but not to publish his faults. If amendment did not follow, the reprover was to call the assistance of others, and ultimately report his crimes to the master in writing; but those accusations were to be supported by proof. The brothers were universally to wear the cross on their breasts. 
<P>The order was that of St. Augustine. He who wished for admission came before the Chapter on Sunday, and humbly expressed his hope that he might be received. If no objection was made, a brother informed him that numbers of men of consequence had preceded him, but that he would be entirely deceived in supposing that he should live luxuriously; for that instead of sleeping he would be required to wake, and fast when desirous to eat, to visit places he would rather have avoided, and, in short, have no will of his own. The exordium concluded with a demand whether he was willing to do these things.   Upon answering in the affirmative, an oath was administered, by which he bound himself never to enter any other order, declared himself a bachelor without having promised marriage, that he was free from debt, and a free-

 man, that he would live and die under the superior whom God should place over him, to be chaste and poor, and a servant to the sick. He who received the new brother then promised him bread and water, and coarse garments, and a participation in all the good works of the order. 
<P>Whoever wished to be received into the brotherhood was required to prove his nobility for <num value="4">four</num> descents, on his mother's as well as his father's side; to be of legitimate birth (an exception being made only in favour of the natural sons of kings and princes); to be not less than <num value="20">twenty</num> years of age, and of blameless life and character. 
<P>The following ceremonies were performed at the creation of a knight:-- <Q> <num value="1">1</num>. A sword was given to the novice, in order to show   that he must be valiant. <num value="2">2</num>. A cross hilt, as his valour must defend religion. <num value="3">3</num>. He was struck <num value="3">three</num> times over the shoulder with the sword, to teach him patiently to suffer for Christ. <num value="4">4</num>. He had to wipe the sword, as his life must be undefiled. <num value="5">5</num>. Gilt spurs were put on, because he was to spurn wealth at his heels. <num value="6">6</num>. He took a taper in his hand, as it was his duty to enlighten   others by his exemplary conduct. <num value="7">7</num>. He had to go and hear mass, where we will leave him.</Q>  <pb id="P.313" n="313"> 
<P>In the season of its prosperity this renowned order included in its fraternity men of <num value="8">eight</num> different nations, of which the English were the <num value="6">sixth</num> in rank. The languages were those of Provence, Auvergne, France, Italy, Arragon, England, and Germany.   The Anglo-Bavarian was afterwards substituted for that of England, and that of Castile was added to the number. Cowardice on the battle-field involved the severest of all penaltiesdegradation and expulsion from the order.    <Q>We place this cross on your breast, my brother,</Q>  says the ritual of admission,  <Q>that you may love it with all your heart; and may your right hand ever fight in its defence and for its preservation. Should it ever happen that, in combating against the enemies of the faith, you should retreat and desert the standard of the cross, and take flight, you will be stripped of the truly holy sign, according to the customs and statutes of the order, and you will be cut off from our body as an unsound and corrupt member.</Q>  A knight, when degraded, had his habit torn from off him, and the spurs which he received at his investiture were hacked off.</QUOTE>

 <QUOTE>the Langue of England,</QUOTE> as an independent corporation existing under the royal letters patent of Philip and Mary, but it proved hard to galvanise the corpse of chivalry. In <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct> Sir Robert Peat was installed into the office of grand prior; and in <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, by proceedings in the Court of King's Bench, the corporation of the <num value="6">sixth</num> Langue was formally revived. Sir Robert Peat was succeeded in <datestruct value="1837--"><year reg="1837">1837</year></datestruct> by Sir Henry Dymoke, <num value="17">seventeenth</num> hereditary champion of the Crown, and in <datestruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></datestruct> the Hon. Sir Charles Montolieu Lamb, Bart., accepted the office. The object of the order is the promotion of charity, and the knights are chiefly Protestants. The heads of the order at Rome still refuse to recognise the English Langue as an integral branch of the ancient order of St. John. 
<P>About <datestruct value="1278--"><year reg="1278">1278</year></datestruct> the knights adopted a red cassock, and a white cross as their military dress, reserving the black mantle worn in imitation of the Baptist's garment in the wilderness for hospital use. Their standard was red, with a white cross. The Hospitallers' churches were all sanctuaries, and lights were kept perpetually burning in them.   The knights had the right of burying even felons who had given them alms during life. <pb id="P.314" n="314"> 
<P>The Hospitallers had also the privilege of administering the sacrament to interdicted persons, and even in interdicted towns; and they were also allowed to bury the interdicted in the churchyards of any of their commanderies.

The governor was entitled, at <num value="1">first</num>, <QUOTE>The Servant to the Poor Serviteurs of the Hospital of Jerusalem.</QUOTE> The knights ended by growing so rich, that about the year of our Lord <datestruct value="1240--"><year reg="1240">1240</year></datestruct>, says Weever, they held in Christendom <num value="19000">19,000</num> lordships and manors. They are known to have lent Edward III. money. In <datestruct value="1211--"><year reg="1211">1211</year></datestruct> Lady Joan Grey of Hampton, left her manor and manor-house of Hampton (several <num value="1000">thousand</num> acres) to the Knights Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem, an estate of which Cardinal Wolsey procured a lease for <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> years from Sir Thomas Docwra, the last prior, who lost the election for the grand mastership by only <num value="3">three</num> votes, when contesting it with his kinsman, L&lsquo;Isle Adam. 
<P>Brave as the Hospitallers of Clerkenwell always remained, they soon, we fear, grew proud, avaricious, and selfish. Edward III. had to reprove the brotherhood for its proud insolence.   When Henry III. threatened to take away their charter, the prior told him that a king who was unjust did not deserve the name of monarch. In <datestruct value="1338--"><year reg="1338">1338</year></datestruct> the English prior, Thomas l&lsquo;Archer, raised <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> by cutting down woods round all the commanderies; he also sold leases and pensions for any terms of ready money, and by bribes to the judges, he procured for the order forfeited lands of the Templars. 
<P>Every preceptory of the Hospitallers paid its own expenses, except that of Clerkenwell, where the grand prior resided, and had many pensioners to support, and many courtly and noble guests to entertain. In the year <datestruct value="1337"><year reg="1337">1337</year></datestruct> this priory spent more than its entire revenue, which was at least <measure value="8000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="8000">8,000</num></measure>. 
<P> <QUOTE>The consumption,</QUOTE> says Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE>of the good things of the earth in the preceptory of Clerkenwell by the brotherhood, the pensioners, guests, and servitors was enormous.

His father's <num value="2">two</num> brothers were also knights of the order, and <num value="1">one</num> of them had been Lord Prior of England and General of the Galleys. At the dissolution King Henry awarded Sir William a pension of <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> a year; but the suppression of the order in England broke his brave heart soon after. Sir Thomas Tresham, the last prior, died a year or <num value="2">two</num> after his investiture. A Sir William Tresham   was residing at Clerkenwell Green   in <datestruct value="1619--"><year reg="1619">1619</year></datestruct>. He was of the same family as Sir Francis Tresham, whose mysterious letter to his friend Lord Monteagle led to the fortunate discovery of the Gunpowder Plot. It will not be forgotten by our readers that a Protestant band of the Knights Hospitallers still exists in Prussia, rich and numerous. 
<P>The Priory of St. John of Jerusalem, at Clerkenwell, was founded by Lord Jordan Briset, in the reign of Henry I. He founded also the Nuns' house at Clerkenwell.   In <datestruct value="1185--"><year reg="1185">1185</year></datestruct> the church was consecrated by Heraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem. In the reign of Edward I. further additions were made to the priory; the preceptory was burned by Wat Tyler's rabble, and it was not till <datestruct value="1504"><year reg="1504">1504</year></datestruct> that the hospital was restored to its full grandeur, and the grand south gate erected   by Sir Thomas Docwra. Camden says of the <num value="2">second</num> building, admiringly, that it resembled a palace, and had in it a very fair church, and a tower-steeple raised to a great height, with so fine workmanship that it was a singular beauty and ornament to the city. 
<P>At the dissolution Henry VIII. gave the priory church to John Dudley, Viscount Lisle, Lord High Admiral of England for <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure>; and the church and priory were used by that bloated Ahab, Henry, as a storehouse for his toils and hunting-tents. Edward VI., as careless of confiscating sacred things as his tyrannical father, gave away the remaining land.

<P>In the year <datestruct value="1485"><year reg="1485">1485</year></datestruct> a royal council was held at St. John's.   Public indignation was aroused by a well-founded rumour of the intended espousal by Richard III. of Elizabeth of York, his niece, his queen, Anne, being then lately dead. <QUOTE>Richard, perceiving the public disgust, gave up the idea of marrying Elizabeth, and immediately after the funeral of his wife was over, called a meeting of the civic authorities in the great hall of St. John's, Clerkenwell, just before Easter, and in their presence distinctly disavowed any intention of espousing his niece, and forbade the circulation of the report, as false and   scandalous in a high degree.</QUOTE> The chronicler relates that a convocation of <num value="12">twelve</num> doctors of divinity had sat on a case of marriage of uncle and niece, and declared that the kindred was too near for the Pope's bull to sanction. 
<P>The Princess Mary lived at the priory in much pomp, sometimes visiting her brother, Edward VI., in great state. Machyn, in his curious diary, describes her riding from St. John's to Westminster, attended by Catholic lords, knights, and gentlemen, in coats of velvet and chains of gold, and on another day returning to St. John's; followed by fourscore Catholic gentlemen and ladies,. each with an ostentatious pair of black beads, <QUOTE>to make a profession of their devotion to the mass.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1540--"><year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct> <num value="10">ten</num> newly-made serjeants-at-law gave a great banquet at St. John's, to all the Lords and Commons, and the mayor and aldermen.

<P>In Elizabeth's reign, when sacred things were roughly handled, Tylney, the queen's Master of the Revels, resided at St. John's, with all his tailors, embroiderers, painters, and carpenters, and all artificers required to arrange court plays and masques.   In this reign Master Tylney licensed all plays, regulated the stage for <num value="31">thirty-one</num> years, and passed no less than <num value="30">thirty</num> of Shakespeare's dramas, commencing with <title>Henry IV</title>. and ending with <title>Anthony and Cleopatra</title>; he might have told us <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> things about the <QUOTE>great unknown,</QUOTE> but he died in <datestruct value="1610--"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct>, and left no diary or autobiography. The court revels were all rehearsed in the great hall at St. John's. In <datestruct value="1612--"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct> James I. gave the priory to Lord Aubigny, and the Revels Office was removed to St. Peter's Hill. The house afterwards came into the possession of Sir William Cecil, grandson of the famous Lord Treasurer Burleigh. The repaired choir was reopened in <datestruct value="1623--"><year reg="1623">1623</year></datestruct>, by Dr. Joseph Hall, afterwards Bishop of <pb id="P.316" n="316"> Exeter and Norwich.   In the reign of Charles I. the church served as private chapel to the Earl of Elgin, who occupied the house, and it was called Aylesbury Chapel. It became a Presbyterian meeting-house till <datestruct value="1710"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct>. 
<P>During the absurd Sacheverell riots, when a High Church mob turned out to destroy Dissenting chapels, St. John's Chapel happening to be near the house of the obnoxious Bishop Burnet, the fanatics gutted the building, and burnt the pews, &amp;c., before Burnet's door.   <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.316.1">Sacheverell</LEMMA> was a High Church clergyman, who, in a public sermon at St. Paul's, had proclaimed the doctrine of passive obedience, and was, in consequence, sent for trial to Westminster Hall, where the Tories triumphantly acquitted him. The chapel was enlarged in <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, and in <datestruct value="1723--"><year reg="1723">1723</year></datestruct> was bought for <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure> by the commissioners for building <num value="50">fifty</num> new churches.

In the south and east walls are remains of Prior Docwra's perpendicular work, and the pews stand upon capitals and rib mouldings of the former church. There are some few traces of early English architecture. An old gabled wooden building near the south side of the church, as seen in Hollar's view of the priory (<datestruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>), is still standing, says Mr. Pinks, and is occupied by St. John's Sunday Schools. Stones of the old church were discovered in <datestruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></datestruct>, forming sides of. the main sewer through St. John's Square. The arms of Prior Botyler (<datestruct value="1439--"><year reg="1439">1439</year></datestruct>-<datestruct value="1469--"><year reg="1469">1469</year></datestruct>), a chevron between <num value="3">three</num> combs, are still to be seen in the central east window. The head of the beadle's staff, a Knight Hospitaller in silver, was in use in the time of James II., and belonged to the old church of St. James. The portable baptismal bowl is antique, and once supplied the place of a font.

<P>The church is, in fact, chiefly remarkable for its crypt, the descent to which is at the north-east angle, under the vestry. It seems originally, by Hollar's view of the east end of the church, in <datestruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>, to have been then above ground. Though <num value="700">700</num> years old, the crypt of St. John's is in good preservation.     The chief portion consists of <num value="4">four</num> bays, <num value="2">two</num> semi-Norman and <num value="2">two</num> early English, the ribs of the latter bays springing from triple clustered columns, with moulded capitals and bases. From each keystone hangs an iron ring. On each side of the <num value="2">two</num> western bays are pointed window openings, now blocked up.   The central avenue of the crypt is <num value="16">sixteen</num> feet wide, and <num value="12">twelve</num> feet high, and there are corresponding side-aisles. At the entrance of the vault is a place where the gardener used to keep his tools, and where, for many years, stood a coffin said to have been arrested for debt. The coffins used to stand in rows, <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> deep, covered with dust, and shreds of black cloth.   The ends of some had fallen out, and the bony feet had protruded. In <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct> a committee of gentlemen reporting on repairs found a sheet of cobweb hanging from the upper coffins <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet long, and in parts nearly as broad. In <datestruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></datestruct> the coffins were piled up in the aisles, that of <QUOTE>Scratching Fanny,</QUOTE> the Cock Lane Ghost, among them, and all the side passages bricked up. 
<P>Many years ago workmen making a sewer beneath the square, nearly in a line with Jerusalem Passage, came on a chalk and flint wall <num value="7">seven</num> feet thick, and Mr. Cromwell decided that this was part of the foundation of the stately tower described by Stow.   It is supposed that the church was <num value="300">300</num> <pb id="P.317" n="317"> feet long, and that its transepts stood in a direct line with St. John's Gate. The enclosure walls can still partially be traced, and the modern buildings in St. John's Square, says Mr. Griffiths, are mostly built on the old rubble walls of the hospital. The foundations of the cellars under No. <num value="19">19</num>, and the basements of Nos. <num value="21">21</num> and <num value="22">22</num> on the north side of St. John's Square, formed the foundations of the old priory walls. Between No. <num value="19">19</num> and No. <num value="20">20</num> a wall was found <num value="7">seven</num> feet thick: some of the stones had been used for windows, and showed the action of fire. The north postern of the priory was taken down in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>: here were then <num value="67">sixty-seven</num> feet of old wall westward of St. John's Gate. There were also remains of the priory in Ledbury Place, which formed the west garden-wall of Bishop Burnet's house, and also in the west garden-wall of Dr. Adam   Clarke's house, which adjoined Burnet's house. 
<P>That fine specimen of Sir Thomas Docwra's perpendicular, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.317.1">St. John's Gate</LEMMA>, is built of brick and freestone.   The walls are about <num value="3">three</num> feet thick, and are built of brick, faced with Ryegate stone, the same as used for Henry VII.'s Chapel. The famous gate and its flanking towers, formerly much higher than they are now   since the soil has risen around them, are pierced with numerous windows, the principal <num value="1">one</num> being a wide Tudor arch, with <num value="3">three</num> mullions and many coats of arms. Beneath this window are several shields, set in Gothic niches.   In the centre are the arms of France and England, surmounted by a crown; on each side are the arms of the priory.   Outside these are <num value="2">two</num> shields, <num value="1">one</num> bearing the founders' arms impaling the arms of England, the other emblazoning the insignia of Sir Thomas Docwra. Underneath these last shields were formerly the initials <QUOTE>T. D.,</QUOTE> separated by a Maltese cross and the word <QUOTE>Prior.</QUOTE> On the north side of the gate, facing the square, are <num value="3">three</num> other shields, and, in low relief, the words <QUOTE>Ano.-Dni., <datestruct value="1504--"><year reg="1504">1504</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> 
<P>The entrance to the west tower, says Mr. Pinks, from the north side of the gate, now no longer used, once led to a staircase, the entrance to Cave's printing-office. The carvings on the spandrils of the doorcase, now decayed, are described in <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct> as representing a hawk and a cock, a hen and a lion, supporting the shield of the priory, and that of Sir Thomas Docwra. The old stone floor is <num value="3">three</num> feet below the present surface. The round tower internally contains remains of the old well staircase (half stone, half oak) which led to the top of the gateway. The upper part was made of blocks of oak <num value="6">six</num> inches thick. The east tower had probably a similar staircase. The stone staircase in the north-west tower was removed in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>. The entrance to the east tower, on the north side the gate, has been long ago blocked up. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct> Hollar draws the gate as blocked up with a wooden structure, beneath which were <num value="2">two</num> distinct passages.   This was removed in <datestruct value="1771--"><year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct>. The roof of the now dwarfed archway is, says an able historian of Clerkenwell, <QUOTE>a beautiful example of the groining of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century, adorned with shields, bosses, and moulded ribs, springing from angular columns with moulded capitals.</QUOTE> On the keystone is carved the paschal lamb, kneeling on a clasped copy of the Gospels, and supporting a flag. In a line with the lamb are coloured shields of the priory, and of Docwra. 
<P>On the east side of the archway Mr. Foster, the keeper of the <QUOTE>Jerusalem</QUOTE> Tavern, and a great lover of ancient architecture, placed a large oilpainting, by Mr. John Wright, representing the Knights of St. John starting for a joust. For the <QUOTE>Jerusalem</QUOTE> Tavern, on the east basement, a south side-entrance was ruthlessly cut through the angle of the projecting gate-tower. 
<P>The basement on the west side was, in <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, converted into a watch-house, and was afterwards turned into a dispensary hospital by the modern Knights of St. John, which in its <num value="1">first</num> year benefited <num value="2062">2,062</num> persons. It then became a coal-shed, and after that a book-store. In many of the gate-house rooms there are still oak--panelled ceilings. The <QUOTE>grand hall,</QUOTE> the memorable room over the arch, is approached by an Elizabethan staircase, and in the hall are <num value="2">two</num> dull figures in armour, supposed, by courtesy, to represent Prior Weston and Prior Docwra; and a handsome bust of Mr. Till, the numismatist, adorns the mantelpiece. It was this Mr. Till who cast from   old Greek and Roman coins the bronze armorial bearings of the priory and of Docwra, which adorn the parlour and hall. 
<P>It was here <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.317.2">Dr. Johnson</LEMMA> toiled for <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.317.3">Cave</LEMMA>, the editor of the   <hi rend=italics><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.317.4">Gentleman's Magazine</LEMMA></hi>, and   here Garrick made his <num value="1">first</num> theatrical debut in London. 
<P>Between <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>-<datestruct value="1741--"><year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct>, says Mr. Percy Fitzgerald, in his <title>Life of Garrick,</title> Garrick's friend Johnson -- <QUOTE>now working out a miserable  <Q>per-sheetage</Q>  from the very humblest hack-work, and almost depending for his crust on some little article that he could now and again get into the <title>Gentleman's Magazine</title>--was by this time intimate with Mr. Cave, of St. John's Gate, the publisher of that journal. Johnson mentioned his companion, and speaking of his gay dramatic talents, inspired this plain and practical bookseller with some curiosity, and it was agreed that an amateur performance should take

 Several of the printers were called in, parts were given to them to read, and there is an epilogue to the <title>Mock Doctor</title>, by Garrick, which, as it was inserted shortly afterwards in the <title>Gentleman's Magazine</title>, would seem to have been spoken on this occasion. This shows how absorbing was his taste for the stage, sure to break out when there was the slightest promise of an opening. The performance gave great amusement, and satisfied the sober Cave; and presently, perhaps as a mark of the publisher's satisfaction, some of Mr. Garrick's short love verses were admitted into the poetical department of the magazine,</QUOTE>

<P>The delightful traditions that encrust, as with many-coloured lichens, the old gate, cluster thickest around the old room   over the arch, for there Johnson, Garrick, and Goldsmith spent many pleasant hours, and it is good to sit there among the club, and muse over the great men's memories. 
<P>In the coffee-room on the basement floor is an old-fashioned wide wooden chair, which, tradition asserts, was the favourite chair of Dr. Johnson. On the top rail is boldly painted the date of the doctor's birth and death. The chair was, however, it is hinted, merely an old chair found in an upper room by Mr. Benjamin Foster, when he took the tavern, and labelled <QUOTE>Dr. Johnson's,</QUOTE> as an attraction to the gullible public.   The stone Tudor mantelpiece in the coffee-room is an old <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="P.319" n="319"> discovered on the pulling down of a modern fireplace. In the wall (<num value="3">three</num> feet <num value="4">four</num> inches thick) in the side of this fireplace was found the entrance to a secret passage opening at the archway of the gate. It is doubtful whether this tavern was opened before or after Cave's death, but it is supposed that it was <num value="1">first</num> called the <QUOTE>Jerusalem</QUOTE> Tavern; this name being assumed from the <QUOTE>Jerusalem</QUOTE> Tavern in Red Lion Street. In <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct> the terms of the Metropolitan Building Act compelled the parish to see to the gate, when the Freemasons of the Church, a useful architectural society, at once generously undertook its restoration, and saved it from being daubed up with cement. The upper portions of the towers were then re-cased with rough stone, the windows new mullioned, at a cost of 
<FIGURE id="Fig.319" n="2000.07.0118"><HEAD>Hicks's Hall. (About <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <measure value="108l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="108">108</num></measure>, the Society of Antiquaries refusing to assist. The original gate was no doubt burned by Wat Tyler's men, but Mr. Griffith, F.S.A., during these restorations, discovered <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.320.1">a fragment of the <num value="1">first</num> gate carved with scallop-shells and   foliage</LEMMA>, in a ceiling in Berkeley Street, Clerkenwell, on the site of the residence of Sir Maurice Berkeley, standard-bearer to Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Elizabeth.   He also, in <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>, discovered near the gate a stone boss, sculptured with foliage, and a carved stone windowhead, from the old priory, with the priory arms in the spandril of the arch.   Both interesting fragments are preserved at the South Kensington Museum. In the reign of James I. this great south gate was given to Sir Roger Wilbraham, who resided here. <pb id="P.320" n="320"> 
<P>In <datestruct value="1731--"><year reg="1731">1731</year></datestruct> the gate became dignified by its connection with literature. Cave, the printer, careful, shrewd, and industrious, set up his presses in the hall over the gateway, and started the <title>Gentleman's Magazine</title>, <datestruct VALUE="1731-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1731">1731</year></datestruct>, displaying the gate in a rude woodcut on the exterior of the periodical, and very soon drew public attention to his magazine. 
<P>With St. John's Gate is connected Dr. Johnson's <num value="1">first</num> struggles towards the daylight. Here, after hungry walks with Savage round St. James's Square, and long controversies in Grub Street cookshops, he came to toil for Cave, who employed him to edit the contributions, and to translate from Latin, French, and Italian. About the year <datestruct value="1738"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct> he produced his <QUOTE>London,</QUOTE> a grand imitation of the <num value="3">third</num> satire of Juvenal. In <datestruct value="1740--"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>, like a loyal vassal of his editor, Johnson gratified an insatiable public curiosity, by giving himself a monthly sketch of the debates in both Houses of Parliament, a scheme projected by a man named Guthrie. <QUOTE>These productions were characterised   by remarkable vigour, for they were written at those seasons, says Hawkins, when Johnson was able to raise his imagination to such a pitch of fervour as bordered upon   enthusiasm.   We can almost picture the doctor in his lone room in the gate, declaiming aloud on some public grievance. For the session of <datestruct value="1740--"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>-<num value="41">41</num> he undertook to write the debates entirely himself, and did so for the whole of <num value="3">three</num> sessions. He began with a debate in the House of Commons on the bill for prohibiting exportation of corn, on the <datestruct VALUE="1740-11-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>, and ended with <num value="1">one</num> in the Lords, on the bill for restraining the sale of spirituous liquors, on the <datestruct VALUE="1742-02-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct>-<num value="3">3</num>. Such was the goodness of Johnson's heart, that a few days before his death he solemnly declared to Mr. Nichols, whom he had requested to visit him,</QUOTE> that the only part of his writings which then gave him any compunction was his account of the debates in the <title>Gentleman's Magazine</title>, but that at the time he wrote them he did not think he was imposing on the world. The mode of preparing them which he adopted, he said, <QUOTE>was to fix upon a speaker's name, then to make an argument for him, and to conjure up an answer.</QUOTE> He wrote these debates with more velocity than any of his other productions; he sometimes produced <num value="3">three</num> columns of the magazine within an hour. He once wrote <num value="10">ten</num> pages in <num value="1">one</num> day, and that not a long <num value="1">one</num>, beginning, perhaps, at noon, and ending early in the evening. Of the <title>Life of Savage</title>
 he wrote <num value="48">forty-eight</num> octavo pages in <num value="1">one</num> day, but that day included the night, for he sat up all night to do it. 
<P> <QUOTE>The memoranda for the debates,</QUOTE> continues Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE>which were published in the <title>Gentleman's Magazine</title> were obtained   sometimes by stealth, and at others from members of the House who were favourable to their publication, and who furnished Cave with notes of what they had themselves said or heard, through the medium of the post, and frequently by <hi rend=italics>viva voce</hi> communication. Cave, when examined at the bar of the House of Lords on the charge of printing an account of the trial of Lord Lovat, in <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct>, being asked, says Nichols, in his  <Q>Literary Anecdotes,</Q>  how he came by the speeches which he printed in the <title>Gentleman's Magazine</title>, replied that he got into the House and heard them, and made use of black-lead pencil, and took notes of only some remarkable passages, and from his memory he put them together himself.   He also observed that sometimes he had speeches sent him by very eminent persons, as well as from the members themselves.</QUOTE> 
<P>When working for Cave, at St. John's Gate, Johnson was still dependent. <QUOTE>We are told,</QUOTE> remarks Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>by Boswell that soon after his  <Q>Life of Richard Savage</Q>  was anonymously published, Walter Harte, author of the  <Q>Life of Gustavus Adolphus,</Q>  dined with Cave at the gate, and in the course of conversation highly commended Johnson's book.   Soon after this Cave met him, and told him that he had made a man very happy the other day at his (Cave's) house.  <Q>How   could that be?</Q>  said Harte;  <Q>nobody was there but ourselves.</Q>  Cave answered by reminding him that a plate of victuals had been sent behind a screen at the dinner-time, and informed him that Johnson, who was dressed so shabbily that he did not choose to appear, had emptied that plate, and had heard with great delight Harte's encomiums on his book. 
<P>From that spoilt child of genius, Richard Savage, Cave had many communications before he knew Johnson. The misfortunes and misconduct of this darling of the Muses reduced him to the lowest state of wretchedness as a writer for bread; and his occasional visits to St. John's Gate brought him and Johnson together, poverty and genius making them akin. 
<P>The amiable and accomplished authoress, Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, whom Johnson, from an appreciation of her talents, highly esteemed, and who was a frequent contributor to the <title>Magazine</title>, under the name of Eliza, during the interval of her occasional visits to London, lodged at St. John's Gate. Hither also came Richard Lauder, Milton's detractor; Dr. Hawkesworth, the author of  <Q>Belisarius;</Q>  and a shoal of the small-fry of literature, who shared the patronage of Cave. <pb id="P.321" n="321"> 
<P>Jedediah Buxton, a mental calculator of extraordinary powers, resided for several weeks in <datestruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct> at St. John's Gate. This man, although he was the son of a schoolmaster (William Buxton), and the grandson of a vicar of his native parish (John Buxton), Elmeton, in Derbyshire, had never learned to write, but he could conduct the most intricate calculations by his memory alone; and such was his power of abstraction, that no noise could disturb him. <num value="1">One</num> who had heard of his astonishing ability as a calculator, proposed to him for solution the following question:--In a body whose <num value="3">three</num> sides measure <num value="23145789">23,145,789</num> yards, <num value="5642732">5,642,732</num> yards, and <num value="54965">54,965</num> yards, how many cubical eighths--of an inch are there?

On the nephew's death Mr. David Bond became the publisher for the family, and continued so till the end of <datestruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct>.

<P>A short biographical notice of the worthy Cave, Johnson's earliest patron, is indispensable to a full history of that interesting relic of old London, St. John's Gate.   The enterprising printer and publisher, born in <datestruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>, was the son of a man reduced in fortune, who had turned shoemaker, and was educated at Rugby. In youth he was alternately clerk to an excise collector, and a Southwark timber-merchant. After being bound apprentice to a London printer, he was sent to manage an office and publish a weekly newspaper at Norwich. He was subsequently employed at the printing-office of Alderman Barber (a friend of Swift), and wrote Tory articles in <title>Mist's Journal.</title>
 Obtaining a small place in the Post Office, he began to supply the London papers with provincial intelligence, and the country printers with surreptitious reports of Parliamentary debates, for which, in <datestruct value="1728--"><year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct>, he was imprisoned for several days. From the Post Office he was moved to the Frank Office, where he was dismissed for stopping a letter--as he considered legally--being a frank given to the terrible old Duchess of Marlborough by Mr. Walter Plummer. Putting by, at last, a sum of money (in spite of endless unsuccessful projects), Cave started the <title>Gentleman's Magazine</title>, and for the last <num value="20">twenty</num> years of his industrious life was an affluent, thrifty man. His prizes for poems and epigrams brought forward but few poets, and his chief prize-takers, after all, turned out to be Moses Browne, a Clerkenwell pen-cutter, and Mr. John Duick, another pen-cutter, in St. John's Lane, with whom Cave used to play at shuttlecock in the old gate-house. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1751--"><year reg="1751">1751</year></datestruct>   the death of his wife hastened Cave's end. <num value="1">One</num> of his last acts was to fondly press the hand of his great contributor, and the main prop and stay of the <title>Gentleman's Magazine, Dr.</title>
 Samuel Johnson.   Cave died at the old gate-house in <datestruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>, and was buried (probably without memorial) in the old church of St. James, Clerkenwell. An epitaph was, however, written by Dr. Hawkesworth for Rugby Church, where all Cave's relations were buried. 
<P>An old <num value="3">three</num>-quarter length portrait of Cave was found by Mr. Foster in a room on the south side of the great chamber over St. John's gateway, and, in his usual imaginative yet business-like way, Mr. Foster labelled it <title>Hogarth.</title>   This gentleman, it is said, originally kept the <QUOTE>Old Milestone</QUOTE> house, in the City Road, near the <QUOTE>Angel,</QUOTE> and in <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct> removed to St. John's Gate, where, by energy and urbanity, he soon hunted up traditions of the place, and, indeed, where they were thin, invented them. He was chairman of the Licensed Victuallers' Asylum, and was active in the cause of benevolence. He died in <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct>, of apoplexy, after speaking at a Clerkenwell vestry-meeting. 
<P>The Urban Club, a pleasant literary society, well supported, was started at St. John's Gate during Mr. Foster's reign, under the name of <QUOTE>The Friday Knights,</QUOTE> but soon changed its name, in compliment to that abstract yet famous personage, Sylvanus Urban. It annually celebrated the birth of Shakespeare in an intellectual and yet convivial way. 
<P>The once famous <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.322.1"> <QUOTE>Hicks's Hall</QUOTE> </LEMMA> from whence <num value="1">one</num> of the milestone   distances from  London was computed, stood, says the indefatigable Mr. Pinks, about <num value="200">200</num> yards from Smithfield, in the widest part of St. John Street, near the entrance to St. John's Lane. Hicks's Hall was a stately house, built in <datestruct value="1612--"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>, as a sessions house for Clerkenwell, by that great citizen, Sir Baptist Hicks, silk mercer, <pb id="P.322" n="322"> in Soper Lane, in the reign of James I. During the reigns of Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth the Middlesex magistrates had generally met in a scrambling and indecorous fashion, at some chance inn, frequently the <QUOTE>Windmill</QUOTE> or the <QUOTE>Castle,</QUOTE> in St. John Street, by Smithfield Bars. The noise of the   carriers' wagons vexing the grave Justice Shallows of those days, James I. granted, in <datestruct value="1610--"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct>, to Sir Thomas Lake and <num value="14">fourteen</num> other knights and esquires of Middlesex, a piece of ground, <num value="128">128</num> feet long and <num value="32">32</num> feet broad, with <num value="20">20</num> feet of carriage-way on each side.   Sir Baptist, having built the new   sessions hall at his own proper charge, feasted, on the day of opening, <num value="26">twenty-six</num> justices of the county, who then, standing up with raised goblets, with <num value="1">one</num> consent christened the new building Hicks's Hall. Sir Baptist seems to have been a most wealthy and influential citizen, and to have lent King James, who was careless and extravagant enough, vast sums of money, besides supplying the court with stuffs and cloths, of tissue and gold; and silks, satins, and velvets, the courtiers getting very much entangled with the rich mercer's bills and bonds. In <datestruct value="1614--"><year reg="1614">1614</year></datestruct> the Earl of Somerset borrowed Sir Baptist's house at Kensington, and it is certain that he lived with all the splendour of a nobleman. In <datestruct value="1628--"><year reg="1628">1628</year></datestruct> Sir Baptist Hicks was advanced to the peerage as Viscount Campden.   He died in the year <datestruct value="1629"><year reg="1629">1629</year></datestruct>, and was buried at Campden, in his native county of Gloucestershire. Of his daughters, <num value="1">one</num> married Lord Noel, the other Sir Charles Morison, of Cashiobury, and it is said he gave each of them <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure> for a marriage portion. He left <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure> to the poor of Kensington, founded almshouses at Campden, and left large sums to the Mercers' Company.   That celebrated   preacher, Baptist Noel, son of the Earl of Gainsborough, Viscount Campden, derived his singular Christian name from the rich mercer of Soper Lane. Sir Baptist's great house at Kensington (with <num value="60">sixty</num> rooms), burnt in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, was, it is said, won by him from Sir Walter Cope, in a game of chance. The Viscountess of Campden, the widow of Sir Baptist, left vast sums in charity, some of which bequests, being illegal, were seized by the Parliament. 
<P>The sessions hall built by Sir Baptist was a mean square brick house, with a stone portico, and annexed to the hall was a round-house, and close by was a pillory. At Hicks's Hall criminals were dissected. This court has been the scene of some great historical trials. The <num value="29">twenty-nine</num> regicides were tried there, and so were many of the conspirators in the so-called Popish Plot; and here also Count Konigsmarck was tried for murdering his rival, Mr. Thynne, and was acquitted. Hicks's Hall is referred to in <title>Hudibras :</title>-

<P>When <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.322.2">Sir John Hawkins</LEMMA>, a builder, the father of Dr. Johnson's spiteful biographer, used to go to Hicks's Hall, as chairman of the Middlesex Quarter Sessions, he used to drive pompously from   his house at Highgate, in a coach and <num value="4">four</num> horses. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct> Hicks's Hall became so ruinous that it was proposed to rebuild it, at an expense of <measure value="12000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="12000">12,000</num></measure>. This was opposed in Parliament, the traffic of Smithfield rendering the place too noisy and inconvenient.

<P>St. John Street, Clerkenwell, is <num value="1">one</num> of the most ancient of the northern London streets, and is mentioned in a charter of confirmation as early as the year <datestruct value="1170"><year reg="1170">1170</year></datestruct>. It seems originally to have been only a way for pack-horses. It was <num value="1">first</num> paved in the reign of Richard II. In the reign of Henry VIII. it had become <QUOTE>very foul, full of pits and sloughs, very perilous and noyous,</QUOTE> and very necessary to be kept clean for the avoiding of pestilence. In Stow's time this road was used by persons coming from Highgate, Muswell Hill, &amp;c., but grand persons often took to the fields, in preference, as we find Elizabeth, James I., and Charles I. doing; and no doubt St. John Street was a deep-rutted, dirty country road, something like a neglected plank road in Kentucky, or a suburban street in a Russian country town. 
<P>There was, in early times, a raised and paved causeway leading from St. John Street to Islington Church, which was called the <QUOTE>Long Causeway.</QUOTE> About <datestruct value="1742--"><year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct> numerous footpads prowled about here. On the fortification of London during the civil wars, in <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>-<num value="3">3</num>, a battery and breastworks were erected at the south end of St. John Street; Captain John   Eyre, of Cromwell's Regiment, superintended them.   There were also fortifications at Mountmill (the plague-pit spot before mentioned), in Goswell Street Road; a large fort, with <num value="4">four</num> half bulwarks, at the New River upper pond, and a small redoubt near Islington Pound. 
<P>What is now Red Lion Street, Clerkenwell, was formerly an open piece of ground belonging to St. John's Priory, subsequently called Bocher or Butt <pb id="P.323" n="323"> Close, and afterwards Garden Alleys. The houses were chiefly built about <datestruct value="1719--"><year reg="1719">1719</year></datestruct>, by Mr. Michell, a magistrate, who lived on the east side of Clerkenwell Green. His house was afterwards occupied by Mr. Wildman, the owner of that unparalleled racehorse, Eclipse, who sold him   to lucky Colonel O&lsquo;Kelly for <num value="1700">1,700</num> guineas. This horse, which was never beaten, and said to be a <QUOTE>roarer,</QUOTE> could run <num value="4">four</num> miles in <num value="6">six</num> minutes and <num value="4">four</num> seconds. 
<P>The house No. <num value="1">1</num>, at the north-west corner of Red Lion Street, was once the <QUOTE>Jerusalem</QUOTE> Tavern, a great house for sales and parochial meetings. It was here that industrious compiler, Mr. John Britton, was bound apprentice to Mr. Mendham, a wine-merchant, an occupation which nearly killed the young student. In snatches of time stolen from the fuming cellar, Britton used to visit Mr. Essex, a literary dial-painter, who kindly lent him useful books, and introduced him to his future partner in letters, Mr. Edward Brayley, and to Dr. Trusler and Dr. Towers, the literary celebrities of Clerkenwell. 
<P>This Dr. Trusler was a literary preacher, who, in <datestruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></datestruct>, resided at No. <num value="14">14</num>, Red Lion Street, and supported himself by selling MS. sermons to the idle clergy. His father had been proprietor of the fashionable <QUOTE>Marybone Gardens,</QUOTE> and his sister made the seed and plum-cake for that establishment.

Cowper, in <QUOTE>The Task,</QUOTE> laughed at Trusler as <QUOTE>a grand caterer and dry nurse of the church.</QUOTE> He seems to have been an impudent projector, for when told by Dr. Terrick, Bishop of London, that he offered his clergy inducements to idleness, Trusler replied that he made <measure value="150l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="150">150</num></measure> a year by his manuscript sermons, and that, for a benefice of the same value he would willingly discontinue their sale.   He afterwards started as printer, at <num value="62">62</num>, Wardour Street, and published endless ephemeral books on carving, law, declamation, farming, &amp;c. <num value="25">twenty-five</num> separate works in all. He died in <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>.   In <datestruct value="1725--"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct> a Jew rag-merchant of this street died, worth <measure value="40000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40000">40,000</num></measure>. Early in the century an Arminian Jew named Simons lived here.   He made some   <num value="200000">200,000</num>, but, ruined by his own and his son's extravagance, died at last in the parish workhouse.

<P>It was to a printer named Sleep, in St. John Street, that Guy Fawkes, <hi rend=italics>alias</hi> Johnson, used to come stealthily, in <datestruct value="1605--"><year reg="1605">1605</year></datestruct>, to meet fellow-Romanists, Jesuits, and other disaffected persons. St. John Street was a great place for carriers, especially those of Warwickshire and Nottingham, and the <QUOTE>Cross Keys,</QUOTE> <num value="1">one</num> of their   houses of call, was <num value="1">one</num> of Savage's favourite resorts, and there probably his sworn friend, Johnson, also repaired.

<P>St. John's Square occupied, says Mr. Pinks, the exact area of the court of the ancient priory. In the reign of James II., a Father Corker built a convent here, which was pulled down by Protestant rioters, in <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>, and several &lsquo;prentice boys were shot by the Horse Guards during the riots. The Little Square, as the north-western side is called, was formerly known as North's Court, from the builder, a relation of Lord Keeper North, in Charles II.'s time. Sir John North resided here in <datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>. Dr. William Goddard, <num value="1">one</num> of the Society of Chemical Physicians, who lived in St. John's Close, as it was then called, was <num value="1">one</num> of those who had Government permission to sell remedies for the Great Plague. At the south-west corner of Jerusalem Passage stood the printingoffice of Mr. Dove, whose neat <QUOTE>English Classics</QUOTE> are still so often seen at old bookstalls. On the south side of the square is the Free-Thinking Christians' Meeting House. This body seceded from   the Baptists, and built this chapel, about the year <datestruct value="1830"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>. They were at <num value="1">first</num> in Old Change, then in Cateaton Street (now   Gresham   Street), but were persecuted by Bishop Porteus. They have discussions on passages of the Bible, but no public prayers or ceremonies whatever. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct> Charles Howard, <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Carlisle, resided in the precincts of St. John's Square. This useful partisan of Charles II., ennobled at the Restoration, was our ambassador in Russia, Sweden, and Denmark, and was subsequently Governor of Jamaica. At the same period Arthur Capel, Earl of Essex, resided here, until <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>. He was afterwards Viceroy of Ireland, and <num value="1">First</num> Lord of the Treasury. Persecuted for his doubtful share in the Rye House Plot, he killed himself in the Tower. Here also lived the <num value="1">first</num> Lord Townshend, <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="5">five</num> Commoners deputed by Parliament to go over to Holland and beg Charles II. to return. Another eminent resident was a staunch Commonwealth man, Sir William   Fenwicke, who died in <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>. To these noble names we have to add that of Sir William Cordell, Master of the Rolls in the times of Mary and Elizabeth.   He was Solicitor- General at the trial of Sir Thomas Wyatt. Queen Elizabeth visited him at his estate in Suffolk, when the Duke of Alencon sent to sue for her hand. <pb id="P.324" n="324">

 manufactory.   His father, Israel Wilkes, a rich distiller, lived in a handsome old, brick house, approached by a paved court with wide iron gates, north of the church.   There had been a distillery here as early as <datestruct value="1747"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct>. The old distiller who lived here, like a generous and intelligent country squire, drove a coach and <num value="6">six</num> horses, and cultivated the society of philosophers, men of letters, noblemen, and merchants.   The house, which was pulled down about <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, was at <num value="1">one</num> time occupied by Colonel Magniac, who rendered himself famous by the automaton clocks he made for the Emperor of China. 
<P>Clerkenwell is noted for its clock-makers, and here armies of busy and intelligent men spend their lives in brass-casting, silvering dials, wheel-cutting, <pb id="P.325" n="325"> pinion-cutting, and glass-bending; and at No. <num value="35">35</num>, Northampton Square, Clerkenwell, is the   British Horological Institute, for the cultivation of the science of horology, and   its kindred   arts and manufactures.

<P>A special feature of this part of Clerkenwell is Burnet House (No. <num value="44">44</num>, formerly No. <num value="36">36</num>), on the west side of St. John's Square. It was originally a noble mansion of <num value="2">two</num> storeys, says Mr. Pinks, and lighted in front by <num value="14">fourteen</num> square-headed windows. The forecourt, upon which shops were built in <datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>, was a garden. The grand entrance, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.325" n="2000.07.0120"><HEAD>The Crypt Of St. John's, Clerkenwell.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 now a poor bricked passage leading to Ledbury Place,   which stands on the site of the bishop's old garden, was approached by several steps, and boasted a portico consisting of <num value="2">two</num> Tuscan columns supporting a moulded entablature. In course of time the house lost caste, till, in <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>, it was shared between an undertaker and a hearth-rug maker, and in <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct> it harboured numerous families. The old staircases are gone, but in the windowless basement are the original kitchens and cellars. <QUOTE>In several of the rooms,</QUOTE> says Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>are very handsome mantelpieces, different in design, the ornaments in relief upon them consisting of flowers and leaves in festoonings, medallions, interlacing lines, and groups of female figures. The chimney <pb id="P.326" n="326"> jambs are of white marble, as are also the hearths. The old stoves have been all removed, and replaced by smaller ones of more recent date. There was formerly a very curious back to <num value="1">one</num> of the grates in this mansion; it was a bas-relief in iron of Charles I., with the date of <datestruct value="1644--"><year reg="1644">1644</year></datestruct> upon it, and represented that monarch triumphantly riding over a prostrate female figure, the Spirit of   Faction.   On each side were pillars, encircled with   bay-leaves and a scroll of palm-branches. On the top were the royal crown, and the initials,  <Q>C. R.,</Q>  and below the effigies of <num value="2">two</num> women, seated on low stools, having baskets of fruit before them. Nothing is known of this device by the subsequent inmates, and it was probably either burnt out or removed. In the north-east corner of the yard of the right wing of the house, raised about eighteen inches from the ground on <num value="2">two</num> piers of brickwork, was an old leaden cistern, the dimensions of which are <num value="4">four</num> feet <num value="2">two</num> inches in length, <num value="20">twenty</num> and a half inches in width, and <num value="2">two</num> feet <num value="6">six</num> and a half inches in depth, with a mean thickness of half an inch. The cistern, which was a massive piece of cast work, was ornamented with several devices in low relief. On the front, and at either end, was a figure of the Goddess of Plenty, recumbent, by the side of a cornucopia overflowing with flowers and fruits, and behind her was a sheaf of full-eared wheat. Within a panel there was also a shield, quite plain, and over this, as a crest, was a lion passant, the dexter paw resting on a blazing star. Near the upper edge of the cistern was the date of its casting, <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct>, and the. initials,  <Q>A. B. M.,</Q>  doubtless those of an occupier antecedent to Burnet's tenancy of the premises. 
<P>There was until recently another cistern on the premises, similar to the above, bearing the date of <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, and the initial  <Q>G.,</Q>  for Gilbert, surmounted by a mitre. This may have been re-cast by <num value="1">one</num> of Burnet's successors, as a memorial of him.   Recently, having fallen from its position, it was removed altogether   off the premises, and sold for old metal, and it is. said to have weighed <num value="4">four</num> hundredweight.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Bishop Burnet, the son of an Edinburgh lawyer, was born in <datestruct value="1643--"><year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct>. He was educated in Aberdeen; in <datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct> he became professor of divinity at Glasgow, and when only <num value="26">twenty-six</num> years old was offered a Scottish bishopric, which he modestly declined. In <datestruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct>, when he had already married a daughter of the Earl of Cassilis, he came to London, and was appointed preacher at the Rolls' Chapel by Sir Harbottle Grimstone, and soon after was chosen lecturer at St. Clement Danes. In <datestruct value="1679--"><year reg="1679">1679</year></datestruct> appeared the <num value="1">first</num> folio volume of the chief work of his life, the <title>History of the Reformation.</title>   Charles II. offered him the bishopric of Chichester, if he would only turn Tory, but Burnet, though vain, and fond of money, conscientiously refused, and even wrote a strong letter to the king, animadverting on his flagrant vices.      At the execution of the good Lord William   Russell, in Lincoln's Inn Fields, Burnet bravely attended him on the scaffold, and in consequence instantly lost the preachership at the Rolls and the lectureship of St Clement's. 
<P>On the accession of James II. Burnet retired to the Continent, and travelled; but on the accession of the Prince of Orange was rewarded by the bishopric of Salisbury. According to some writers, Burnet was the very paragon of bishops. <num value="2">Two</num> months every year he spent in traversing his diocese. He entertained his clergy, instead of taxing them with dinners, and helped the holders of poor benefices. He selected promising young men to study in Salisbury Close, under his own eye; and was active in obtaining Queen Anne's Bounty, for the increasing small livings. 
<P>Burnet died at his Clerkenwell house in <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct>, and was buried near the communion-table of St. James's, Clerkenwell, the base Tory rabble flinging stones and dirt at the bishop's hearse. 
<P>In conversation Burnet is described as disagreeable, through a thick-skinned want of consideration. <num value="1">One</num> day, during Marlborough's disgrace and voluntary exile, Burnet, dining with the duchess, who was a reputed   termagant, compared the duke to Belisarius. <QUOTE>How do you account for so great a man having been so miserable and deserted?</QUOTE> asked the duchess. <QUOTE>Oh, madam,</QUOTE> replied the bishop, <QUOTE>he had, as you know, such a brimstone of a wife.</QUOTE> Burnet was opposed to the clergy enjoying a plurality of livings. A clergyman of his diocese once asked him if, on the authority of St. Bernard, he might hold <num value="2">two</num> livings. <QUOTE>How will you be able to serve them both?</QUOTE> inquired Burnet. <QUOTE>I intend to officiate by deputy in <num value="1">one</num>,</QUOTE> was the reply. <QUOTE>Will your deputy,</QUOTE> said Burnet, <QUOTE>be damned for you too? Believe me, sir, you may serve   your cure by proxy, but you must be damned in person.</QUOTE> 
<P>Burnet was extravagantly fond of tobacco and writing, and to enjoy both at the same time, he perforated the brim of his large hat, and putting his long pipe through it, puffed and wrote, and wrote and puffed again. 
<P>How far Burnet's historical writings can be relied on is still uncertain. He was a wholesale Whig, and seems to have been a vain, credulous man, who, according to Lord Bathurst, listened too much to flying gossip. Swift, in his violent and ribald way, denounced Burnet as a common liar, but, on <pb id="P.327" n="327">

 the whole, we are inclined to think that he was only a violent party man, who, however, had a conscience, and tried his best to be honest. There is no doubt, however, from a letter discovered in the Napier charter chest, that on the discovery of the   Rye House Plot, Burnet made many timid advances to the cruel and corrupt court. 
<P>In Burnet's house afterwards lived that remarkable man, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.327.2">Dr. Joseph Towers</LEMMA>, the son of a poor bookseller in Southwark, who was born in the year <datestruct value="1737"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>.

 In <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct> Towers was arrested for his connection with the Society for Constitutional Information, of which Sheridan, Erskine, and the Duke of Norfolk were members.

Again, on the trial of a man for murder, who was suspected of being a Dissenter, and whom he had a great desire to hang, he fined and imprisoned all the jury, because, contrary to his directions, they brought in a verdict of manslaughter.</QUOTE> Retribution came at last to this unjust judge. He was cited to the bar of the House of Commons in <datestruct value="1667--"><year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>, for constantly vilifying Magna Charta, and only obtained mercy by the most abject submission.

Sir John Coke, then Secretary of State, drew up a report of the discovery, which has been edited by Mr. Nichols, and re-published in the <title>Camden Miscellany.</title> Sir John's narrative commences thus: <QUOTE>About Christmas last Humphrey Cross, <num value="1">one</num> of the messengers in ordinarie, gave mee notice that the neighbours in St. John's saw provisions carried into the corner house uppon the broadway above Clerkenwel, but knewe none that dwelt there.

The time considered, I thought fitt to make noe further delay, and therefore gave warrant to the sayd Crosse and Mr. Longe, and the constables next adjoyning to enter the house, and to search what persons resorted thither, and to what end they concealed their being there. At their entrie they found <num value="1">one</num> that called <pb id="P.328" n="328"> himselfe Thomas Latham, who pretended to be keeper of the howse for the Earle of Shrewsburie. They found another, named George Kemp, said to be the gardener; and a woman, called Margaret Isham.   But when they desired to go further, into the upper roomes, which (whilst they had made way into the hall) were all shutt upp and made fast, Latham tould them plainly that if they offred to goe further they would find resistance, and should doe it at their perils.   They thereuppon repared to my house and desired more help, and a more ample warrant for their proceedings. And then both a warrant was granted from the councell boorde, and the Sheriffes of London were sent for theire assistance. But by this protraction they within the upper roomes gott advantage to retire themselves by secret passages into theire vaults or lurkinge-places, which themselves called their securities; so as when the officers came   up they found no man above staires save only a sick man in his bed, with <num value="1">one</num> servant attending him. The sick man called himselfe by the name of Weeden, who is since discovered to be truely called Plowden; and the servant named himselfe John Penington. More they found not, til, going downe againe into the cellars, Crosse espied a brick wall, newly made, which he caused to be perced and there within the vault they found Daniel Stanhop, whom I take to be Father Bankes, the Rector of their college, George Holland, alias Guy Holt, Joseph Underhill, alias Thomas Poulton, Robert Beaumond, and Edward Moore, the priest; and the next day, in the like lurkinge-place, they found Edward Parre.</QUOTE>

<P>Bowling-Greens were once numerous in Bowling Green Lane, Clerkenwell. In <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, says Mr. Pinks, there were <num value="2">two</num> at the north-east corner.   The bowling-alleys were both open and covered, and were laid with turf or gravel. The bowls were flat or round, and the simple object was to lay your bowl so many times nearest the jack, or mark. The pleasant game is repeatedly mentioned by Shakespeare, and furnished his quick fancy with innumerable metaphors. There was also a game of ground balls, which were driven through an arch. This game expanded became <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.328.3">Charles II.'s favourite diversion, <QUOTE>Pall Mall,</QUOTE> </LEMMA> and, contracted and complicated, it changed into our modern <QUOTE>Croquet.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1617--"><year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct> (James I.) the Groom Porters' Office issued licences for <num value="31">thirty-one</num> bowling-alleys, <num value="14">fourteen</num> tenniscourts, and <num value="40">forty</num> gambling-houses in London, Westminster, and their suburbs, all to be closed on Sundays. In <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct> there were only <num value="6">six</num> houses in this lane, and at the south-west corner was the churchyard of St. James's.   The <QUOTE>Cherry Tree</QUOTE> public-house was well known in <datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>, and there were cherry-trees still there in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>. At the southwest corner of Bowling Green Lane, in <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, stood <num value="1">one</num> of those mountain heaps of cinders and rubbish which disgraced old London. At <num value="1">one</num> end of the lane there once stood a whipping-post for petty offenders. An old name for this lane was Feather Bed Lane, but why we do not know, unless boys like Defoe's Colonel Jack lolled, burrowed, and gambolled on the huge dust-heap. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.328.4">Clerkenwell Close</LEMMA> teems with old legends and traditions; and well it may, for was it not part of the old nunnery cloisters, and afterwards a portion of the glebe of the church of St. James? The house now No. <num value="22">22</num>, says Mr. Pinks, the Stow of Clerkenwell, was originally the parsonage house. The <QUOTE>Crown Tavern,</QUOTE> at the south-west corner of the Close, was rebuilt in the early part of this century. The mummy of a poor cat, which some mason of John or Richard's reign had cruelly buried alive in <num value="1">one</num> of the walls of St. James's Church, used to be solemnly shown there. Formerly the southern entrance to the Close was small, and squeezed in between   a butcher's shop   and   the <QUOTE>Crown Tavern.</QUOTE> 
<P>That good plodding <QUOTE>old mortality,</QUOTE> John Weever, lived in Clerkenwell Close in <datestruct value="1631--"><year reg="1631">1631</year></datestruct> (Charles I.), and to that place brought home many a pocket-load of old epitaphs, to adorn his good old book, <title>Ancient Funeral Monuments.</title> His house was the next <num value="1">one</num> northward of No. <num value="8">8</num>. It is large, and double-fronted, and has fine old staircases, and foliated ceilings. Weever was a friend of Cotton and Selden, and therefore not lightly to be despised, but Anthony a Wood pronounces him credulous, and he is said to <pb id="P.329" n="329"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.329.1">Oliver Cromwell's House-Clerkenwell Close</LEMMA></NOTE>
 be careless in his dates. The following is Weever's epitaph, in St. James's, Clerkenwell: 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Lancashire gave me breath, 
<L>And Cambridge education; 
<L>Middlesex gave me death, 
<L>And this church my humation; 
<L>And Christ to me hath given 
<L>A place with Him in heaven.</QUOTE>
 
<P>In the Close, opposite the nunnery, according to Weever, resided Sir Thomas Challoner, in a house which either Thurlow or Cromwell himself afterwards occupied. On the front of the mansion, which stood in a large garden, were written <num value="4">four</num> Latin lines, which have been thus Englished:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Chaste faith still stays behind, though thence be flown 
<L>Those veiled nuns who here before did nest, 
<L>For reverend marriage wedlock vows doth own, 
<L>And sacred flames keep here in loyal breasts.</QUOTE>
 
<P>This Sir Thomas Challoner, of Clerkenwell Close, was a gallant gentleman, who fought beside the Emperor Charles V., in Algiers, on his return he was made by Henry VIII. <num value="1">first</num> clerk of the Council, and in the reign of Edward VI. he won the favour of the proud   Protector Somerset.   By Elizabeth he was sent as a trusty ambassador to Ferdinand, Emperor of Germany, and afterwards   to the court of Philip of Spain, where he was vexed by every possible indignity. He returned home in <datestruct value="1564--"><year reg="1564">1564</year></datestruct>, and spent the rest of his life quietly in the Close, completing his great work, <QUOTE>The Right Ordering of the English Republic,</QUOTE> which   he dedicated to his friend Burleigh. Sir Thomas, son of this wise courtier, married a daughter of Sir William Fleetwood, the well-known   Recorder of London.   His study of science in Italy enabled him to enrich himself by the discovery of   alum   on his own estate, near Gisborough, in Yorkshire.   He became a friend of James I., who placed Prince Henry under <hi rend=italics>his</hi>
 tuition, for which he received <measure value="4000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4000">4,000</num></measure>, <QUOTE>as a free gift.</QUOTE> <num value="2">Two</num> of this learned man's sons sat as judges at the trial of Charles I., and <num value="1">one</num> was bold enough to sign the king's death-warrant. This latter Challoner Cromwell openly denounced as a drunkard when he dissolved the obstructive Parliament. 
<P>Near the Challoners, in the Close, in the year <datestruct value="1619"><year reg="1619">1619</year></datestruct>, resided the <num value="4">fourth</num> Earl of Clanricarde. This nobleman married the widow of Sir Philip Sidney. At the Restoration there were <num value="31">thirty-one</num> good houses in Clerkenwell Close, Sir John Cropley and Dr. Theophilus Garenciers being the most distinguished residents. The latter gentleman was a Protestant refugee from Normandy, and kindly taught the <QUOTE>musical small-coal man</QUOTE> chemistry. He wrote some books on tapeworms and tincture of coral, and translated the nonsensical prophecies of Nostradamus. In <datestruct value="1668--"><year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct> Dr. Everard Maynwaring resided in the Close. He was a kinsman of the wife of Ashmole, the antiquary, and wrote a book to show that tobacco produced scurvy. 
<P> <QUOTE>An old writer, Aubrey,</QUOTE> says Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE>who compiled an amusing volume on the superstitions of his countrymen, when treating of a fatality believed to attach to certain houses, says:-- <Q>A handsome brick house, on the south side of Clerkenwell Churchyard, has been so unlucky for at least <num value="40">forty</num> years, that it was seldom tenanted, and at last nobody would adventure to take it.</Q>  This was written in <datestruct value="1696--"><year reg="1696">1696</year></datestruct>. Here also was once a private madhouse, of which the public was apprised by advertisement, as follows:-- <Q>In Clerkenwell Close, where the figures of mad people are over the gate, liveth <num value="1">one</num> who, by the blessing of God, cures all lunatick, distracted, or mad people. He seldom exceeds <num value="3">three</num> months in the cure of the maddest person that comes in his house;   several have been cured in a fortnight, and some in less time. He has cured several from   Bedlam, and other madhouses in and about this city, and has conveniency for people of what quality soever. No cure, no money.</Q>    Such equitable dealing as this, there can be little doubt, secured for the proprietor of this asylum a fair share of patronage from   the friends of the insane.</QUOTE> 
<P>Newcastle Place was the site of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.329.2">old Newcastle House</LEMMA>, built upon the ruins of the nunnery, which had, at the dissolution, become the property of the Cavendish family.   <num value="1">One</num> likes to believe that a curse fell on those greedy nobles who stole what good and charitable men had left in trust for the poor, but that the trust had been sometimes abused, who is hardy enough to deny?   But the abuses of the priests could surely have been corrected better than by confiscation.   The duke's garden extended as far as the present St. James's Walk, and contained <num value="6">six</num> arches of the southern cloister of the old nunnery. <num value="1">One</num> cloister is described in the <title>Gentleman's Magazine</title> of <datestruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct> as having at its west end an arched door communicating with the church. The roof resembled that of Exeter Cathedral, and the keystones were carved into the form of flowers. Over the cloister was a wareroom, and on the east side of the garden was the site of the ancient cemetery of the nuns.   In <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>, according to Noorthouck, the nuns' hall, which still stood at the north-east end of the cloisters, had been turned into a double range of workshops. <num value="2">Two</num> brickedup arched windows, and the hood moulding of a Gothic doorway are visible in the sketch of the hall in Crowle's <title>Pennant.</title>
 
<P>The Duke of Newcastle, William Cavendish, and <pb id="P.330" n="330"> his blue-stocking and eccentric wife, Margaret, the youngest daughter of Sir Charles Lucas, who was shot by the Parliamentarians at the surrender of Colchester, were the most memorable residents in this great Clerkenwell mansion. The duke was a gallant and chivalrous cavalier, whose white regiment of cavalry, generally known to the Cromwellians as the <QUOTE>Newcastle Lambs,</QUOTE> did good service for wilful King Charles during the Civil War.   In disgust at the loss of the battle of Marston Moor, by the mad rashness of Prince Rupert, the duke retired to the Continent, and there, with his faithful wife, during eighteen years' exile, endured many hardships while lodging at Antwerp, in a house which belonged to the widow of Rubens. 
<P>In the duchess's memoir of her brave husband, on whom she doated, and whom she seems to have pretty considerably bored, she states that at <num value="1">one</num> time of their exile they were both forced to pawn their clothes for a dinner.   While abroad the duke produced a luxurious folio on horsemanship. During his absence the Parliament levied, it is computed, <measure value="733579l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="733579">733,579</num></measure>   on his estate.   At the Restoration this faithful loyalist was made a chief

The duchess, a female <hi rend=italics>savante</hi> of the deepest dye, wrote <num value="10">ten</num> folio volumes of learned trifles and fantastic verses.   A footman always slept on a truckle bed in a closet of her bedroom, and whenever a thought struck her in the night, she used to call out, <QUOTE>John!</QUOTE> and poor John had to scramble out in the cold, light a candle, and bind the fugitive fancy fast on paper. <QUOTE>The whole story,</QUOTE> writes Pepys, <QUOTE>of this lady is a romance, and all she does is romantic.</QUOTE> <datestruct VALUE="1667-04-26"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=26>26</day>, <year reg=1667>1667</year></datestruct>.-Met my Lady Newcastle, with her coaches and footmen, all in velvet, herself, whom I never saw before, as I have heard her often described, for all the town-talk is nowadays of her extravagance, with her velvet cap, her hair about her ears, many black patches, because of pimples about her mouth, naked-necked, without anything about it, and a black <hi rend=italics>just au corps.</hi>

 which set the whole family by the ears. The Earl of Thanet, another son-in-law, fought a duel with the Earl of Clare, in consequence, in Lincoln's Inn Fields, in which both combatants were wounded. The Earl of Clare, for his loyal service to William III., was, in <datestruct value="1694--"><year reg="1694">1694</year></datestruct>; created Duke of Newcastle, and enjoyed the favour of Queen Anne. 
<P>Newcastle House, at <num value="1">one</num> period, was the residence of the eldest daughter of the old duke, the Duchess of Albemarle, a woman crazed with pride, who married General Monk's son, and drove him by her folly to a liquid remedy, which killed him in his youth. At his death the duchess was so immensely wealthy, that pride crazed her, and she vowed never to marry any <num value="1">one</num> but a sovereign prince. In <datestruct value="1692--"><year reg="1692">1692</year></datestruct> the Earl of Montague, disguising himself as the Emperor of China, won the mad woman, whom he then kept in constant confinement at Montague House (the site of the British Museum).

Her body lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber, Westminster Abbey, and at midnight was privately interred near her father-in-law, General Monk, in Henry VII.'s <pb id="P.332" n="332"> Chapel. It is said that up to the time of this mad woman's decease she was always served on the knee, as if she had really been the empress she believed herself. 
<P>Newcastle House, in Pennant's time, was a cabinet-maker's, and the garden was strewn with the defaced monuments of Prior Weston, and other worthies. About <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct> Mr. Carr, who built the present church of St. James, erected on the site of the duke's mansion the row of houses called Newcastle Place. Every trace of the convent then disappeared, except a small portion of a wall, the jamb of a Gothic window of the nuns' hall (now the side wall of a house at the north end of Newcastle Street). The old house was a sombre, monotonous brick structure, having its upper storey adorned with stone pilasters. The east and west wings stood forward, and there was a large courtyard in front. 
<P>Clerkenwell Green, long gay enough, was, in the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, according to that admirable chronicler of the parish, Mr. Pinks, environed by mansions of the noble and rich. In Roques's huge Map of London in <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct> there were lofty trees on either side of the Green, and <num value="2">two</num> at the north-east corner of Aylesbury Street. The last tree on the north side of the Green, says Mr. Pinks, was blown down in <datestruct VALUE="1796-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>. The old pillory, where Mr. John Britton had seen a man fastened and pelted, used to stand on the western slope of the Green, near the bottom, and in <datestruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></datestruct> a woman who had committed perjury was nearly killed at this place of punishment. A turnstile stood at the entrance of the close, prior to the houses being taken down to form a better approach to the church. A raised circle of stone with lamp-posts, near the middle of the green, and close to the drinking-fountain, marks, says the best of the local historians, the spot where the old watch-house once stood. 
<P>On the north side of the Green, a low brick house, now divided into <num value="3">three</num> shops, was formerly the Welsh Charity School, founded in <datestruct value="1718--"><year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct>. The house was built in <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>, and the charity removed to the Gray's Inn Road in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, and after that to Ashford, near Windsor.   There used to be a painted figure of a Welsh boy in a niche in the front of the school.   Pennant, a warm-hearted Welshman, intended to have devoted the profits of his great work on <title>British Zoology</title> to this school, but its expenses were so great that he was unable to do so, and he gave instead the sum of <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>. 
<P>Of the chief residents of Clerkenwell Green we can only select the most eminent. Amongst these we may mention Sir Richard Cheverton, the Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1657--"><year reg="1657">1657</year></datestruct>, who proclaimed Richard Cromwell Protector. He lived long, and was styled the Father of the City. Sir William Bolton, an alderman, knighted by Charles II., also resided on the Green, and in <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct> we find, in the list of rich residents, Sir William Bowles, Bart., Sir Edward Smith, and Lady Windham. 
<P>Above all these aldermen   and custos rotulorums, rejoice, Clerkenwell, because that good and gentle spirit, Izaac Walton, once lived in thy midst, and often paced his guileless path, pondering on mighty barbel in the muddy depths of the pleasant river Lea. On his retirement from the snug little linendrapers' shops, <num value="1">first</num> at the Exchange and then in Fleet Street, Walton, before the year <datestruct value="1650"><year reg="1650">1650</year></datestruct>, says Sir Harris Nicholas, took a house at Clerkenwell.   That delightful book, 
<title>The Compleat Angler; or, the Contemplative Man's Recreation,</title> sold by Richard Marriot, in St. Dunstan's Churchyard, Fleet Street, appeared in <datestruct value="1653--"><year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>.   The good, pious old fisherman lived at Clerkenwell, it is supposed, till <datestruct value="1661"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>.   He went to Worcester after that, and died at Winchester, at the house of a son-in-law of his, a prebendary, in <datestruct value="1683--"><year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>. In his will the worthy old man left <num value="42">forty-two</num> mourning-rings to his friends, and (could human forgiveness go further?) <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> to his publisher, Richard Marriot. 
<P>George Sawbridge, an eminent bookseller of <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, who published a book by Culpeper, the herbalist, also dwelt on Clerkenwell Green. He left <measure value="40000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40000">40,000</num></measure> to be divided among his <num value="4">four</num> daughters. Elias Ashmole records that he was a friend of Lilly, the sham astrologer. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.333.1">Jack Adams, a Clerkenwell simpleton</LEMMA>, who lived on the Green, became a notorious street   character in the reign of Charles II. This half fool, half knave (like many of Shakespeare's jesters) is constantly mentioned in pamphlets of Charles II.'s reign. In an old work, called <title>The Wits; or, Sport upon Sport</title> (published in <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct>), the writer describes the excellent comedians at the Red Bull Theatre, in Red Bull Yard, now Woodbridge Street. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, when Robert Cox, a celebrated low comedian, played <QUOTE>Simpleton the Smith,</QUOTE> he used to come in munching a huge slice of breadand-butter; Jack Adams, seeing it, cried out, <QUOTE>Cuz, cuz, give me some! give me some!</QUOTE> to the great amusement of all the spectators.   This Adams seems to have turned astrologer and fortune-teller. You got a better fortune from him for <num value="5">five</num> guineas than for <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure>, and he appears to have been as willing to cheat as his dupes were to be cheated. The conjuror of Clerkenwell seems, after this, to have generally adopted this popular name. There is an old print of Jack Adams, in which he is <pb id="P.333" n="333"> represented with a tobacco-pipe in his girdle, standing by a table, on which lies a horn-book and <QUOTE>Poor Robin's Almanac.</QUOTE> 
<P>In <datestruct value="1644--"><year reg="1644">1644</year></datestruct>, during the Civil Wars, Lady Bullock's house, on Clerkenwell Green, was attacked by soldiers, who stole <num value="50">fifty</num> pieces of gold, and tore <num value="5">five</num> rich rings from her ladyship's fingers. Dr. Sibbald, the incumbent of Clerkenwell, who resided near, remonstrated with the Parliamentary soldiers from his window, but the only reply was <num value="3">three</num> musketbullets at his head, which they narrowly missed. A servant of Lady Bullock's was wounded by the soldiers. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct> the Lamb and Flag Ragged School was established on Clerkenwell Green.   Since that time day-schools, night-schools, and Sunday-schools have been added to it. 
<P>At the corner of Ashby Street, which leads from St. John's Street Road to Northampton Square, stands the old manor house of Clerkenwell, the residence of the Northampton family till nearly the end of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. The <num value="1">first</num> baron was Sir Henry Compton, of Warwickshire, summoned to Parliament among the nobles in <datestruct value="1572--"><year reg="1572">1572</year></datestruct> (Elizabeth). The <num value="2">second</num> Lord Compton was created Earl of Northampton in <datestruct value="1618--"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct> (James I.), and also K.G. and Lord President of the Marches and Dominions of Wales. 
<P>How that nobleman carried off the daughter of rich Lord Mayor Spencer, in a baker's basket, from Canonbury, we have before related. The wife of the <num value="2">second</num> earl had the courage to attend her lord to the battle of Edgehill, where she witnessed the daring and danger of her <num value="3">three</num> Cavalier sons. Spencer Compton fell at the battle of Hopton Heath, in <datestruct value="1643--"><year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct>. The <num value="3">third</num> earl resided at Clerkenwell in <datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>; his estates, which had been confiscated, were returned to him at the Restoration. He is said to have had a troop of <num value="200">200</num> retainers, who wore his livery of blue and grey, and he was <num value="1">one</num> of the king's Privy Council and Constable of the Tower. This earl's youngest brother, after being a cornet of horse, was made Bishop of London, and was entrusted with the education of the Princesses Mary and Ann. After being suspended by James II., he performed the coronation service for William of Orange, and was appointed <num value="1">one</num> of the commissioners for revising the Liturgy. His toleration of Dissenters rendered him   unpopular with the Tories. He died in <datestruct value="1713--"><year reg="1713">1713</year></datestruct>. Joshua Alwyne Spencer, the <num value="10">tenth</num> earl, was the President of the Royal Society. 
<P>At the end of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century the old manor-house of the Spencers was converted into a private lunatic asylum, by Dr. Newton. Thoresby, the   Leeds historian, speaks doubtfully of this doctor's honesty. He published a herbal, which Cave printed, and seems to have had a botanic garden behind the madhouse.     It was here that strange fanatic and false prophet, Richard Brothers, was confined. This man had been a lieutenant in the Royal .Navy, but left the service in <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>, and refusing, from conscientious scruples, to take the necessary oath, he lost his half-pay.   He then became poor, and had to take refuge in a workhouse. In <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct> he became insane, believed himself a prophet sent from God, and warned all who called him mad, an impostor, or a devil, that they were guilty of blasphemy. In <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct> he sent letters to the king, the ministers, and the speaker, saying he was ordered by God to go to the House of Commons, and inform the members, for their safety, that the time was come for the fulfilment of the <num value="7">seventh</num> chapter of Daniel. He went accordingly, and met with the rough reception that might have been expected. Soon after Brothers prophesied the death of King George, the overthrow of the monarchy, and the delivery of the crown into his own hands, which, being treasonable, he was sent to Newgate. On his release, he persuaded many weak people to sell their goods and prepare to accompany him, in <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, to the New Jerusalem, which was to be built on both sides of the river Jordan, and to become the capital of the world. In <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct> the Jews were to be restored, and he was to be revealed as their prince and ruler, and the governor of all nations a post for which Brothers had even refused the divine offer of the Chancellorship of the Exchequer. Brothers at last got too troublesome, even for English toleration, and was confined as a lunatic in   Clerkenwell; he was released in <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, by the zealous intercession of his great disciple, John Finlayson, with whom he afterwards resided for <num value="9">nine</num> years. Brothers died suddenly, of cholera, in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>.   His last words were addressed to Finlayson, asking if his sword and hammer were ready, referring to the building of the New Jerusalem.   In <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct> the old manorhouse was turned into a ladies' boarding-school. 
<P>Albemarle Street was so called from General Monk, Duke of Albemarle, during whose popularity the street was built. Albion Place was erected in <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>. In this street, in <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, lived Christopher Pinchbeck, an inventor of <QUOTE>astronomico-musical clocks,</QUOTE> and the peculiar compound metal to which he gave the name. We have already briefly mentioned this ingenious man in our chapter on Fleet Street.   Pinchbeck made musical automata that played tunes and imitated birds, like the curious Black Forest clocks now so familiar to us.   He <pb id="P.334" n="334"> also sold self-playing organs, to save the expense of organists in country churches, and he also condescended to mend clocks and watches. 
<P>Miss Ray, that unfortunate mistress of Lord Sandwich, who was shot by her lover, Hackman, the clergyman, served her time with a mantuamaker in St. George's Court, Albion Place. A pleasant memory of those delightful old engravers, the Bewicks, is also associated with St. George's Court, for here, about <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, lived a bookseller named Hodgson, for whom they worked. In the same obscure yet honoured locality also lived that sturdy old antiquary, Dr. Thomas Birch, the son of a Quaker coffee-mill maker, of Clerkenwell. Birch eventually, after being usher to Mr. Besse, a Quaker in St. George's Court, took orders in the Church of England, and married the daughter of a clergyman. Lord Hardwick patronised him, and in <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct> he became domestic chaplain to the unfortunate Jacobite Earl of Kilmarnock, who, joining in the luckless rebellion of &lsquo;<num value="45">45</num>, was beheaded on Tower Hill. In <datestruct value="1743--"><year reg="1743">1743</year></datestruct> he was presented to the united rectories of St. Michael, Wood Street, and St. Mary Staining. He worked much for Cave, and was killed by a fall from his horse, near Hampstead, in <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>. He bequeathed his valuable library and manuscripts to the British Museum, and the residue of his small property to increase the salaries of the <num value="3">three</num> assistant librarians. 
<P>Aylesbury Street, says Mr. Pinks, is so called because in old times the garden-wall of the house of the Earls of Aylesbury skirted the south side of the thoroughfare. Aylesbury House was probably a name given to part of the old Priory of St. John, where the Earls of Elgin and Aylesbury resided about <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>. Robert Bruce, <num value="2">second</num> Earl of Elgin, who lived here in <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>, was a devoted Cavalier, and an ardent struggler for the Restoration, and was made Earl of Aylesbury in <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct> by that not usually very grateful king, Charles II., to whom he was privy councillor and gentleman of the bedchamber. At the coronation of that untoward monarch, James II., the Earl of Aylesbury bore in procession St. Edward's staff, <measure value="8l." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num> pounds</measure> <num value="9">nine</num> ounces in weight, and supposed by credulous persons to contain a piece of the true cross. The earl died in <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>, the year he had been appointed Lord Chamberlain   of the   Royal Household. Anthony Wood sums up the earl as a good historian and antiquary, a friend to the clergy, and a <QUOTE>curious collector of manuscripts.</QUOTE> 
<P>But a far more interesting resident in Aylesbury Street was <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.334.1">Thomas Britton</LEMMA>, the <QUOTE>musical smallcoal man,</QUOTE> who, though a mere itinerant vendor of small coal, cultivated the highest branches of music, and drew round him for years all the great musicians of the day, including even the giant Handel.   This singular and most meritorious person, born in Northamptonshire, brought up to the coal trade, and coming to London, took a small stable at the south-east corner of Jerusalem Passage, on the site now occupied by the <QUOTE>Bull's Head</QUOTE> public-house, and commenced his humble business. His coal he kept below, and he lived in a single room above, which was ascended by an. external ladder.   From   Dr. Garenciers, his neighbour, this active-minded man obtained a thorough knowledge of practical chemistry, and in his spare time he acquired an extensive practical and theoretical knowledge of music. This simpleminded man founded a musical club, which met at his house for nearly <num value="40">forty</num> years, and at <num value="1">first</num> gave gratuitous concerts, afterwards paid for by an annual subscription of <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure>, coffee being sold to his distinguished visitors at a penny a cup. The idea of the club is said to have been <num value="1">first</num> suggested by Sir Roger l&lsquo;Estrange. Dr. Pepusch, or the great Handel, played the harpsichord; Bannister, or Medler, the <num value="1">first</num> violin. Hughes, a poet, and Woolaston, a painter, were also members, while Britton himself played excellently on the viol di gamba. The musical invitation to these concerts ran thus: 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Upon Thursdays repair to my palace, and there 
<L>Hobble up stair by stair, but I pray you take care 
<L>That you break not your shins by a stumble; 
<L>And without e'er a souse, paid to me or my spouse, 
<L>Sit still as a mouse at the top of the house, 
<L>And there you shall hear how we fumble.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Britton's friend, Ned Ward, describes these pleasant Thursday evening concerts, which, he says, were as popular as the evenings of the Kit-Cat Club, and that Britton, in his blue frock, with a measure twisted into the mouth of his sack, was as much respected as if he had been a nobleman in disguise. 
<P> <QUOTE>Britton,</QUOTE> says our Clerkenwell historian, <QUOTE>besides being a musician, was a bibliomaniac, and collector of rare old books and manuscripts, from which fact we may infer that he had cultivated some   acquaintance   with   literature.   It   often happened that, on Saturdays, when some of these 
<hi rend=italics>literati</hi> were accustomed to meet at the shop of <num value="1">one</num> Christopher Bateman, a bookseller, at the corner of Ave Maria Lane, Paternoster Row, Britton, who had usually completed his morning round by <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock at noon, would, despite his smutty appearance and blue smock, after pitching his sack of small coal on the bulk of Bateman's shop, join the literary conclave, and take part in <pb id="P.335" n="335"> the conversation, which generally lasted an hour. Often as he walked the streets some <hi rend=italics>who knew</hi>
 him would point him   out, and exclaim,  <Q>There goes the small-coal man, who is a lover of learning a performer of music, and a companion for gentlemen.</Q>    The circumstance of Britton's death are as remarkable as those of life; he was literally frightened out of his life by   practical joke which was played on him by <num value="1">one</num> Robe, a justice of the peace, and a frequenter of his concerts, who   <num value="1">one</num> day introduced as his friend a man who had the sobriquet of the  <Q>Talking Smith,</Q>  but whose real name was Honeyman. This man possessed the power of ventriloquism, and when he saw Britton he, by a preconcerted arrangement, announced in a solemn voice, which seemed to   come from a long distance, the death of Britton in   hours, unless he immediately fell upon his knees and repeated the Lord's Prayer. Britton, in the terror of his soul, instinctively obeyed; but the chord of his life was unstrung by this sudden shock. A brief illness supervened, and   in a few days he died. His death occurred in <datestruct VALUE="1714-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct>, when he was upwards of <num value="60">sixty</num> years of age.   On the     <datestruct value="10-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct> his remains were followed to the grave by a great concourse of people, and   interred   in St. James's churchyard.</QUOTE> Though Britton was honest and upright, ill-natured people, says Walpole, called him a Jesuit and an atheist, and said that the people attended his meetings to talk sedition and practise magic.   At his death the worthy smallcoal man   left <num value="1400">1,400</num>   books, <num value="27">twenty-seven</num>   fine musical instruments, and some valuable music. 
<P>Berkeley Street, formerly called Bartlett Street, was so named from its chief pride, Berkeley House, which stood at the corner facing St. John's Lane. The advanced wings of the mansion enclosed a spacious forecourt, and at the rear was a large garden. Sir Maurice Berkeley, who lived here, was standard-bearer to Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Queen Elizabeth.   He it was who, when Sir Thomas Wyatt was beaten back from Ludgate to Temple Bar,   yet would not surrender,   induced Wyatt to mount behind him on his horse, and ride to Whitehall.   In this house lived   and died that pious Earl Berkeley, who in Charles II.'s time was called <QUOTE>George the Traveller,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>George the Linguist.</QUOTE> The <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Berkeley obtained the title of Viscount Dursley Earl of Berkeley as a reward for his loyalty to Charles II. When the English prisoners   were to be released from Algiers he   offered to advance the money for their redemption.       He bestowed on Sion College a valuable library, and he wrote some   religious meditations, which obtained   for him   a eulogy from   Waller.   He died in <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>.   His <num value="2">second</num> daughter, Lady Theophila, married the pious and learned   Robert Nelson, author of <title>Fasts and Festivals.</title>   At what period Berkeley House was pulled down is unknown, but in the year <datestruct value="1856"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct> a moulded brick,   stamped with a lyre, supposed to be a relic of the old mansion, was found in Berkeley Street. 
<P>At the south-east end of Ray   Street, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.335.1">a broken iron pump</LEMMA>, let into the front wall of a dilapidated tenement, says Mr. Pinks, marks, as nearly as possible, the site of the old Clerks' Well, used by the brothers of St. John and the Benedictine nuns, and the place where, as the old chronicler says, the London parish clerks performed their miracle plays. In Stow's time this fine spring was cared for and sheltered with stone. In Aggas's map (about <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>) there is a Conduit-house at the south-west corner of the boundary wall of St. Mary's nunnery, and the water falls into an oblong trough, which is enclosed by a low wall. In <datestruct value="1673--"><year reg="1673">1673</year></datestruct> the Earl of Northampton gave this spring for the use of the poor of the parish of St. James, but it was at once let to a brewer. Strype, writing about <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, describes the well as at the right-hand side of a lane which led from   Clerkenwell to Hockley-in-the-Hole, and it was then enclosed by a high wall, which had been built to bound Clerkenwell Close.   Hone, in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, writing of the mystery plays of the Middle Ages, points out that as the priory stood about half way down the slope from   Clerkenwell Green to the Fleet, people stationed on the rising ground near could have easily seen the quaint performances at the well. Near the pump, erected in <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>, to mark the old well, stood <num value="1">one</num> of the parish watchhouses, erected in <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Vineyard Walk, Clerkenwell, is supposed to mark the site of <num value="1">one</num> of the old priory vineyards. The ground was called the Mount, and against the western slopes grew vines, row above row, there being a small cottage at the top. It existed in this form as late as <datestruct value="1752"><year reg="1752">1752</year></datestruct>. There was also a vineyard in East Smithfield as late as the reign of Stephen. It is said that the soil of this Mount Pleasant was sold, in <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, for <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>. 
<P>That remarkable man, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.336.1">Henry Carey</LEMMA>, the author of <title>Sally in our Alley,</title> <num value="1">one</num> of the very prettiest of old London love songs, lived and died at his house in Great Warner Street. Carey, by profession a music-master and song-writer for Sadler's Wells, was an illegitimate son of the Marquis of Halifax, who presented the crown to William III.

A   shoemaker's apprentice making holiday with his sweetheart, treated her with a sight of Bedlam, the puppet-shows, the flying chairs (ups and downs), and all the elegancies of Moorfields, and from thence proceeding to the Farthing Pye House, he gave her a collation of buns, cheesecakes, stuffed beef, and bottled ale; through all of which scenes the author dodged them. Charmed with the simplicity of their courtship, he wrote his charming song of <title>Sally in our Alley,</title> which has been well described as <num value="1">one</num> of the most perfect little pictures of humble life in the language.

<P>The Red Bull Theatre, a house as well known, in Elizabeth's time, as the Globe or the Fortune, stood at the south-west corner of what was afterwards a distillery, in Woodbridge Street.

<P>The old church of St. James, Clerkenwell, was only a fragment in Stow's time.   No. <num value="22">22</num> in the Close was the original rectory house. The church was sold   in <datestruct value="1656--"><year reg="1656">1656</year></datestruct> to   trustees for the parish.

The old building was pulled down in <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>, and a fine monument of Sir William Weston, the last prior of St. John's, was sold to Sir George Booth, and removed to Burleigh. The prior's effigy represented a skeleton. There was also a fine brass over the monument of Dr. John Bell, Bishop of Worcester in the time of Henry VIII., to whom it is said he acted as secretary. He was engaged by the king in the matter of his divorce from Catherine of Arragon and Anne of Cleves. He was buried, says Green, the historian of Worcestershire, <QUOTE>like a bishop, with mitre and odours, things that belong to a bishop, with <num value="2">two</num> white branches, <num value="2">two</num> dozen staves, torches, and <num value="4">four</num> great tapers, near the altar,</QUOTE> in the old church of St. James, Clerkenwell. On the north side of the church stood a costly stone altar-tomb, with Corinthian pillars, to the memory of Lady Elizabeth Berkeley, whose effigy lay in state, with the head of a negro at her feet. This lady was a gentlewoman to the Princess Elizabeth, in the Tower, and refusing to go to mass, was so threatened that she was compelled to fly to Geneva, where she remained till the death of the persecuting Mary. There was also the monument of Thomas Bedingfield, <num value="1">one</num> of Queen Elizabeth's gentlemen pensioners, the son of that worthy Governor of the Tower who treated Elizabeth with such kindness and forbearance when, in her earlier years, she was a prisoner in his care. 
<P>The old church also contained a marble tablet, affixed to a chancel pillar, to the memory of that patient old antiquary, John Weever, who collected a great volume of epitaphs and inscriptions. A tomb to the   memory of Elizabeth, Countess of Exeter, who married the grandson of the famous Burleigh, and died in <datestruct value="1653--"><year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>, is now in the vaults of the new church. On a painted board near this tomb it was stated that the venerable countess was grandmother to <num value="32">thirty-two</num> children, and great-grandmother to <num value="33">thirty-three</num>. In the old chapter-house, which had been turned into a vestry, was buried Sir Thomas Holt; father of the famous Lord Chief Justice Holt. Near the south-east corner of the church--was a black and white marble   monument, which had been erected in memory of George Strode, an old Cavalier officer, and a great benefactor to the poor of Clerkenwell. 
<P>The new church of St. James, which cost nearly <measure value="12000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="12000">12,000</num></measure>, was consecrated by Bishop Porteus, in <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>.

<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.339.5">Smithfield</LEMMA>, or <QUOTE>Smoothfield,</QUOTE> to follow the true derivation, was from the earliest times a memorable spot in old London. Bartholomew Fair, established in the reign of Henry II., in the neighbourhood of the priory and hospital founded by Rayer, the king's worthy jester, brought annually great crowds of revellers to the same place where, in Mary's cruel reign, so many of her <num value="277">277</num> victims perished. Smithfield, in the reign of the early Edwards, was a chosen place for tournaments, and here many a spear was splintered on breastplate and shield, and many a stout blow given, till armour yielded or sword shattered. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1374--"><year reg="1374">1374</year></datestruct> Edward III., then <num value="62">sixty-two</num>, enamoured of Alice Pierce, held a <num value="7">seven</num> days' tournament in Smithfield, for her amusement. She sat beside the old man, in a magnificent car, as the Lady of the Sun, and was followed by a long train of plumed knights, careless of the disgrace, each leading by the bridle a beautiful palfrey, on which was mounted a gay damsel. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1390--"><year reg="1390">1390</year></datestruct> that young prodigal, Richard II., wishing to rival the splendid feasts and jousts given by Charles of France, on the entry of his consort, Isabella of Bavaria, into Paris, invited <num value="60">sixty</num> knights to a tilt in Smithfield, commencing on the Sunday after Michaelmas Day. This tournament was proclaimed by heralds, in England, Scotland, Hainault, Germany, Flanders, and France. The Sunday was the feast of the challengers. About <measure value="3d." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> p.</measure>m. came the procession from the Tower --<num value="60">sixty</num> barbed. coursers, in full trappings, each attended by a squire of honour, and after them <num value="60">sixty</num> ladies of rank, mounted on palfreys, <QUOTE>most elegantly and richly dressed,</QUOTE> and each leading by a silver chain a knight, completely armed for tilting, minstrels and trumpeters attending the procession to Smithfield.   Every night there was a magnificent supper for the tilters at the bishop's palace, where the king and queen were lodged, and the dancing lasted till daybreak.   On Tuesday King Edward entertained the foreign knights and squires, and the queen the ladies. On Friday they were entertained by the Duke of Lancaster, and on Saturday the king invited all the foreign knights to Windsor. 
<P>That great historical event, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.339.6">the death of Wat Tyler</LEMMA>, we have elsewhere described, but it is necessary here to touch upon it again. Wrongs, no doubt, his followers had, but they were savage and cruel, and intoxicated with murder and plunder. They had beheaded the Archbishop of Canterbury, and held London in terror for <num value="7">seven</num> days. Wat Tyler's insolent behaviour at the meeting in Smithfield (<datestruct VALUE="1381-06-15"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=15>15</day>, <year reg=1381>1381</year></datestruct>) greatly alarmed the king's friends.   He came towards Richard, throwing his dagger in the air, and he even ventured to hold the king's bridle. Walworth, in the alarm of the moment, ran his sword into the rough rebel's throat, and at the same instant a squire stabbed Wat in the side. It was then that <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.339.7">Richard II. courageously, and with great presence of mind, led off the rebels to Islington Fields</LEMMA>, where the mayor and a <num value="1000">thousand</num>   men soon scattered them to the winds. 
<P>Smithfield was frequently chosen as the scene of mediaeval duels, and of the ordeal by battle. The combat, in the reign of Henry VI., between the master arid the &lsquo;prentice, who had accused him of treason, will be remembered by all readers of Shakespeare.   The ordeal was, perhaps, hardly fairly tried in this case, as the poor armourer had been plied with liquor by his over-zealous friends; but there is <num value="1">one</num> comfort, according to the poet, he confessed his treason in his dying moments. . <P>Smithfield was, at <num value="1">one</num> time, a place of torture peculiarly in favour with theologians. Here that swollen Ahab, Henry VIII., burnt poor wretches who denied his ecclesiastical supremacy; here Mary burnt Protestants, and here Elizabeth burnt Anabaptists.   In <datestruct value="1539--"><year reg="1539">1539</year></datestruct> (Henry VIII.) Forest, an Observant friar, was cruelly burnt in Smithfield, for denying the king's supremacy, the flames being lit with <QUOTE>David Darvel Gatheren,</QUOTE> an idolatrous image from Wales. Latimer preached patience to the friar, while he hung by the waist and struggled for life. And here, too, was burnt Joan Boucher, the Maid of Kent, for some theological refinement as to the incarnation of Christ, Cranmer almost forcing Edward VI. to sign the poor creature's death-warrant. <QUOTE>What, my lord!</QUOTE> said Edward, <pb id="P.340" n="340">

 <QUOTE>will ye have me send her quick to the devil, in her error? I shall lay the charge therefore upon you, my Lord Cranmer, before God.</QUOTE> 
<P>Of the last moments of the Smithfield martyrs, Foxe, their historian, has left a narrative, so simply told, so pious in tone, and so natural in every detail, as to guarantee its truth to all but partisans. A few passages from Foxe will convey a perfect impression of these touching scenes, and of the faith wherewith these good and brave men embraced death. Speaking of Roger Holland, a Protestant martyr, Foxe says, with a certain exultation:-- <QUOTE>The day they suffered a proclamation was made that none should be so bold to speak or talk any word unto them, or receive anything of them, or to touch them upon pain of imprisonment, without either bail or mainprize; with divers other cruel threatening words, contained in the same proclamation. Notwithstanding the people cried out, desiring God to strengthen them; and they, likewise, still prayed for the people, and the restoring of His word.   At length Roger, embracing the stake and the reeds, said these words:-- <Q> Lord, I most humbly thank Thy Majesty that Thou hast called me from the state of death unto the light of Thy heavenly word, and now unto the fellowship of Thy saints, that I may sing and say, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts! And Lord, into Thy hands I commit my spirit. Lord, bless these Thy people, and save them from idolatry.</Q>    And so he ended his life, looking up into heaven, praying and praising God, with the rest of his fellow, saints: for whose joyful constancy the Lord be praised.</QUOTE> 
<P>The end of <num value="3">three</num> more of the holy army Foxe thus gives:-- <QUOTE>And so these <num value="3">three</num> godly men, John Hallingdale, William Sparrow, and Master Gibson, being thus appointed to the slaughter, were, the <num value="12">twelfth</num> day after their condemnation (which was the <num value="18">18th</num> day of the said month of <datestruct VALUE="1557-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1557">1557</year></datestruct>), burnt in Smithfield in London. And being brought thither to the stake, after their prayer made, they were bound thereunto with chains, and wood set unto them; and after wood, fire, in the which being compassed about, and the fiery flames consuming their flesh, at the last they yielded gloriously and joyfully their souls and lives into the holy hands of the Lord, to whose tuition and government I commend thee, good reader. Amen.</QUOTE> 
<P>Of the heroic death of John Rogers, the protomartyr in the Marian persecution, Foxe gives the following account:-- 
<P> <QUOTE>After that John Rogers,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>had been long and straitly imprisoned, lodged in Newgate amongst thieves, often examined and very uncharitably treated, and at length unjustly and most cruelly, by wicked Winchester, condemned. The <datestruct value="02-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, A.D. <datestruct value="1555"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct>, being Monday in the morning, he was warned suddenly by the keeper's wife of Newgate, to prepare himself to the fire; who, being then sound asleep, scarce with much shogging could be awaked. At length, being raised and waked, and bid to make haste,  <Q>Then,</Q>  said he,  <Q>if it be so I need not tie my points;</Q>  and so was had down <num value="1">first</num> to Bonner to be degraded. That done, he craved of Bonner but <num value="1">one</num> petition.   And Bonner asking what that should be:  <Q> Nothing,</Q>  said he,  <Q>but that I might talk a few words with my wife before my burning.</Q>  But that could not be obtained of him.  <Q>Then,</Q>  said he,  <Q>you declare your charity, what it is.</Q>  And so he was brought into Smithfield by Master Chester and Master Woodroofe, then sheriffs of London, there to be burnt; where he showed most constant patience, not using many words, for he could not be permitted; but only exhorting the people constantly to remain in that faith and true doctrine which he before had taught and they had learned, and for the confirmation whereof he was not only content patiently to suffer and bear all such bitterness and cruelty as had been showed him, but also most gladly to resign up his life, and to give his flesh to the consuming fire, for the testimony of the same. 
<P>The Sunday before he suffered he drank to Master Hooper, being then underneath him, and bade them commend him unto him, and tell him,.  <Q>There was never little fellow better would stick. to a man than he would stick to him,</Q>  presupposing they should both be burned together, although it happened otherwise, for Master Rogers was burnt alone <gap>  Now, when the time came that he, being delivered to the sheriffs, should be brought out of Newgate to Smithfield, the place of his execution, <num value="1">first</num> came to him Master Woodroofe, <num value="1">one</num> of the aforesaid sheriffs, and calling Master Rogers unto him, asked him if he would revoke his abominable doctrine and his evil opinion of the sacrament of the altar. Master Rogers answered and said,  <Q> That which I have preached I will seal with my blood.</Q>     <Q>Then,</Q>  quoth Master Woodroofe,  <Q>thou art a heretic.</Q>     <Q>That shall be known,</Q>  quoth Rogers,  <Q>at the day of judgment.</Q>   <Q>Well</Q>  quoth Master Woodroofe,  <Q>I will never pray for thee.</Q>   <Q>But I will pray for <hi rend=italics>you</hi>,</Q>  quoth Master Rogers; and so was brought the same day, which was Monday, the <datestruct value="02-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, by the sheriffs towards Smithfield, saying the psalm  <Q>Miserere</Q>  by the way, all the people wonderfully rejoicing at his constancy, with great praises and thanks to God for <pb id="P.341" n="341"> the same.   And there, in the presence of Master Rochester, Comptroller of the Queen's Household, Sir Richard Southwell, both the sheriffs, and a wonderful number of people, the fire was put unto him; and when it had taken hold both upon his legs and shoulders, he, as <num value="1">one</num> feeling no smart, washed his hands in the flame as though it had been in cold water. And, after lifting up his hands unto heaven, not removing the same until such time as the devouring fire had consumed them, most mildly this happy martyr yielded up his spirit into the hands of his heavenly Father. A little before his burning at the stake his pardon was brought if he would have recanted, but he utterly refused. He was the <num value="1">first</num> martyr of all the blessed company that suffered in Queen Mary's time, that gave the <num value="1">first</num> adventure upon the fire. His wife and children, being <num value="11">eleven</num> in number, and <num value="10">ten</num> able to go, and <num value="1">one</num> sucking on her breast, met him by the way as he went towards Smithfield. This sorrowful sight of his own flesh and blood could nothing move him; but that he constantly and cheerfully took his death, with wonderful patience, in the defence and quarrel of Christ's Gospel.</QUOTE>
 
<P>The chosen place for executions before Tyburn was the Elms, Smithfield, between <QUOTE>the horsepond and Turnmill brook,</QUOTE> which, according to Stow, began to be built on in the reign of Henry V. The gallows seems to have been removed to Tyburn about the reign of Henry IV. In Stow's time none of the ancient elms remained. Here that brave Scotch patriot and guerilla chief Sir William Wallace, was executed, on St.   Bartholomew's Eve, <datestruct value="1305"><year reg="1305">1305</year></datestruct>. After many cruel reprisals on the soldiers of Edward I., and many victories, this true patriot was betrayed by a friend, and surrendered to the conquerors. He was dragged from the Tower by horses, and then hung, and, while still conscious, quartered. Here also perished ignominiously Mortimer, the cruel favourite of the queen, the murderess of her husband, Edward II. Edward III., then aged eighteen, seized the regicide, Mortimer, at Nottingham Castle, and he was hung at the Elms, the body remaining on the gibbet, says Stow, <QUOTE><num value="2">two</num> days and nights, to be seen of the people.</QUOTE> 
<P>The history of Bartholomew Priory and of Bartholomew Fair, so admirably narrated by Mr. Henry Morley, is an interesting chapter in the history of Smithfield. The priory was founded by Rayer, a monk, who had been jester and revel-master to Henry I., a specially superstitious monarch. Rayer was converted by a vision he saw during a pilgrimage to Rome, where he had fallen grievously sick. In his vision Rayer was borne up to a high place by a beast with <num value="4">four</num> feet and <num value="2">two</num> wings, from whence he saw the mouth of the bottomless pit. As he stood there, crying out and trembling, a man of majestic beauty, who proclaimed himself St. Bartholomew the Apostle, came to his succour. The saint said that, by common favour and command of the celestial council, he had chosen a place in the suburbs of London where Rayer should found a church in his name. Of the cost he was to doubt nothing; it would be his (St. Bartholomew's) part to provide necessaries. 
<P>On Rayer's return to London he told his friends and the barons of London, and by their advice made his request to the king, who at once granted it, and the church was founded early in the <num value="12">twelfth</num> century. It was an unpromising place, though called the King's Market, almost all marsh and dirty fens, and on the only dry part stood the Elms gibbet. Rayer, wise in his generation, now feigned to be halfwitted, drawing children and idlers together, to fill the marsh with stones and rubbish. In spite of his numerous enemies, many miracles attended the building of the new priory.   At evensong a light appeared on the new roof; a cripple recovered the use of his limbs at the altar; by a vision Rayer discovered a choral book which a Jew had stolen; a blind boy recovered his sight. In the <num value="12">twelfth</num> year of his prelacy Rayer obtained from King Henry a most ample charter, and leave to institute a <num value="3">three</num> days' fair on the Feast of St. Bartholomew, forbidding. any but the prior levying dues on the frequenters of the fair during those <num value="3">three</num> days. Fairs, as Mr. Morley has most learnedly shown, generally originated in the assembling of pilgrims to church festivals, and St. Bartholomew's Fair was no exception to the rule. 
<P>Rayer, after witnessing endless miracles, and showing a most creditable invention, and a true knowledge of his old juggler's art, died in <datestruct value="1143--"><year reg="1143">1143</year></datestruct>, leaving a little flock of <num value="13">thirteen</num> monks, living very well on the oblations of the rich Londoners. The miracles continued very well. The saint became a favourite with seamen, and the sailors of a Flemish ship, saved by prayers to the saint of Smithfield, presented a silver ship at his altar. The saint appeared to a sailor on a wreck, and led a wrecked Flemish merchant to land in safety. He cured madmen, and was famous in cases of fires and possession by devils. 
<P>Fragments of the old Norman priory of Rayer still exist in Bartholomew   Close, and the dim passage called Middlesex Passage.   This latter place is a fragment of the old priory, overhung by the wreck of the great priory hall, now broken up, divided into floors, and turned into a tobaccofactory.   On each side of this passage there is <pb id="P.342" n="342"> access to separated portions of the crypt. In <num value="1">one</num> pickle-store there are pointed Norman arches under a high vaulted ceiling. The entrance to the crypt used to be by a descent of <num value="25">twenty-five</num> feet, until the floor was raised for business convenience. There is a tradition that at the end of this long subterranean hall there used to be a door opening into the church; now the visitor to the shrine will only find, through an alley a door and bit of church wall hemmed in between factories. The present church is the choir of the old priory, and the nave is entirely gone; the last line of the square of cloisters had been turned into a stable, and fell down some <num value="30">thirty</num> years ago. The apse is shorn off, and a base brick wall closes that forlorn space. <QUOTE>Half-way,</QUOTE> says Mr. Morley, <QUOTE>between capital and base of the pillars of that oratory of the Virgin which a miracle commended once to reverence, now stands the floor of the vestry of the parish church.</QUOTE> The walls and aisles on either side of the church are still nearly as when Rayer's sham miracles and pious trickeries were all over, and he took a last glance at the great work of his singular life, and the house raised to God and the builder's own vanity.      The high aspiring columns and solid 
<FIGURE id="Fig.342" n="2000.07.0125"><HEAD>Place Of Execution In Old Smithfield.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 arches, the zig-zag ornaments of the early Normans, are still as when Rayer eyed them with crafty triumph. 
<P>The site of the priory was chosen with a true monkish wisdom.   The saint had included in his wishes a piece of the king's Friday Market, and horses, oxen, sheep, and pigs would all bring grist, in <num value="1">one</num> way or another, to the omnivorous monastic mill. Already Smithfield was the great horsemarket of London, as it continued to be for many long centuries. On Shrove Tuesday every schoolboy came here to play football; and it was also the Rotten Row of the horsemen of the Middle Ages. It was the great Campus Martius for shamfights and tilts. It was a ground for bowls and archery; the favourite haunt of jugglers, acrobats, and posture-makers.   There were probably, in early times, says Mr. Morley, <num value="2">two</num> Bartholomew Fairs, <num value="1">one</num> held in Smithfield, and <num value="1">one</num> within the priory bounds. The real fair was held within the priory gates, and in the priory churchyard; where, too, on certain festivals, schoolmasters used to bring their boys, to hold in public logical controversies. The churchyard fair seems from the <num value="1">first</num> to have been chiefly a draper's and clothiers' <pb id="P.343" n="343"> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.343" n="2000.07.0126"><HEAD>The <QUOTE>Hand And Shears.</QUOTE> A Case Before The Court Of Pie-Poudre. (From A Drawing Dated <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="P.344" n="344"> fair; and the gates were locked every night, and guarded, to protect the booths and stands. 
<P>The English kings did not forget the hospital. In <datestruct value="1223--"><year reg="1223">1223</year></datestruct> we find that King Henry III. gave an old oak from Windsor Forest as fuel for the infirm in the Hospital of St. Bartholomew, the generous grant to be renewed every year.   In <datestruct value="1244--"><year reg="1244">1244</year></datestruct> (Henry III.) a disgraceful religious brawl occurred at the very gate of the West Smithfield Priory. Boniface, the Provencal Archbishop of   Canterbury, came to visit Rayer's friars, and was received with solemn procession.   The bishop was rather angry at the state, and told the canons that he passed not for honour, but to visit them as part of the duties of his office. The canons, irritated at his pride, replied that having a learned bishop of their own, they desired no other visitation.   The archbishop, furious at this, smote the sub-prior on the face, crying, <QUOTE>Indeed! indeed! doth it become you English traitors, so to answer me?</QUOTE> Then, bursting with oaths, this worthy ecclesiastic fell on the unfortunate sub-prior, tore his rich cope to shreds, trampled them under foot, and then thrust the wearer back with such force against a chancel pillar as nearly to kill him. The canons, alarmed at this furious onslaught, pulled the archbishop on his back, and in so doing discovered that he was armed. The archbishop's Provencal attendants, seeing their master down, fell in their turn on the Smithfield canons, beat them, rent their frocks, and trod them under foot. The canons then ran, covered with blood and mire, to the king, at Westminster, but he refused to interfere.   The citizens, by this time roused, would have rung the common bell, and torn the foreign archbishop to pieces, had he not fled over the water to Lambeth.   They called him a ruffian and a cruel brute, and said he was greedy for money, unlearned and strange, and, moreover, had a wife. 
<P>The early miracle plays seem to have been often performed at Smithfield.   In <datestruct value="1390--"><year reg="1390">1390</year></datestruct> the London parish clerks played interludes in the fields at Skinner's Well, for <num value="3">three</num> consecutive days to Richard II., his queen, and court.   In <datestruct value="1409--"><year reg="1409">1409</year></datestruct> (Henry IV.) the parish clerks played <title>Matter from the Creation of the World</title> for <num value="8">eight</num> consecutive days ; after which followed jousts. In those early times delegates of the merchant tailors, with their silver measure, attended Bartholomew Fair, to try the measures of the drapers and clothiers. 
<P>From the earliest times of which there is record, says Mr. Morley, whose wide nets few odd facts escape, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.344.1">the Court of Pie-poudre</LEMMA>, which has jurisdiction over offences committed in the fair, was held within the priory gates, the prior being lord of the fair. It was held, indeed, to the last, close by, in Cloth Fair. After <datestruct value="1445--"><year reg="1445">1445</year></datestruct> the City claimed to be joint lord of the fair with the prior, and <num value="4">four</num> aldermen were always appointed as keepers of the fair and of the Court of Pie-poudre.

<P>A great part of the priory was rebuilt in the reign of Henry IV., and it became famous for its mulberry-garden, <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> planted in England. That garden stood to the east of the present Middlesex Passage, and it was under its great leafy trees that scholars at fair-time held their logical disputations. Within the gates the northern part of the priory ground was occupied by a large cemetery with a spacious court, now Bartholomew Close. After the time of Henry IV. the City established a firm right to all fair-tolls outside the priory enclosure. The last prior of St. Bartholomew who was acknowledged by the English kings died in office, and was the last prior but <num value="1">one</num> of the Black Canons of West Smithfield. This was that same Prior Bolton who built the oriel in the church for the sacristan to watch the altarlights;   and he built largely, as we have already shown, at Canonbury.  He had <num value="2">two</num> parishes, Great St Bartholomew and Little St. Bartholomew, within his jurisdiction.   At the dissolution the priory and the hospital were torn apart by greedy hands for ever. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1537--"><year reg="1537">1537</year></datestruct> Sir Thomas Gresham, then Lord Mayor, prayed that the City might govern St. Mary, St. Thomas, and St. Bartholomew Hospitals, <QUOTE>for the relief, comfort, and aid of the helpless poor and indigent.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1544--"><year reg="1544">1544</year></datestruct> the king established a new Hospital of St. Bartholomew, under a priest, as master, and <num value="4">four</num> chaplains; but the place was <pb id="P.345" n="345"> mismanaged, and King Henry VIII. founded it anew, <QUOTE>for the continual relief and help of a <num value="100">hundred</num> sore and diseased.</QUOTE> 
<P>At the dissolution the privileges of the fair were shared by the corporation and Lord Rich (died <datestruct value="1568--"><year reg="1568">1568</year></datestruct>), ancestor of the Earls of Warwick and Holland.   The Cloth Fair dwindled away in the reign of Elizabeth, when the London drapers found wider markets for their woollens, and the clothiers, as roads grew better, started to wider fields. The <num value="3">three</num> days' fair soon grew into a <num value="14">fourteen</num> days' carnival, to which all ranks resorted.   We find the amiable and contemplative Evelyn writing of his having   seen <QUOTE>the   celebrating follies</QUOTE> of Bartholomew; and that accumulative man, Sir Hans Sloane, sending a draughtsman to record every 
<hi rend=italics>lusus naturae</hi> or special oddity.   In <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct> (Queen Anne), the nuisance of such licence becoming intolerable to the neighbourhood, the fair was again restricted to <num value="3">three</num> days. The saturnalia was always formally opened by the Lord Mayor, and the proclamation for the purpose was read at the entrance to Cloth Fair.   On his way to Smithfield it was the custom for the mayor to call on the keeper of Newgate, and on horseback partake of <QUOTE>a cool tankard of wine, nutmeg, and sugar;</QUOTE> the flap of the tankard lid, it will be remembered, caused the death of the mayor, Sir John Shorter, in <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>, his horse starting, and throwing him violently.   The custom   ceased in the <num value="2">second</num> mayoralty of Sir Matthew Wood.

And this field, commonly called West Smithfield, was for many years called  <Q>Ruffians' Hall,</Q>  by reason it was the usual place of frayes and common fighting during the time that sword and bucklers were   in use. But the ensuing deadly fight of rapier and dagger suddenly suppressed the fighting with sword and buckler.</QUOTE>

<P>That fine, vigorous old satirist, Ben Jonson, the dear friend   and   protege of Shakespeare, named <num value="1">one</num> of his best comedies after this great London fair, and has employed his Hogarthian genius to depict the pickpockets, eating-house-keepers, protesting Puritans, silly citizens, and puppet-show proprietors of the reign of <hi rend=italics>James I</hi>.   Some extracts from   his amusing play, <title>Bartholomew   Fair,   <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct></title>
 (written in the very climax of the author's power), are indispensable in any history,   however brief, of this outburst of national merriment.   The following extract from Mr. Morley's <title>History of Bartholomew Fair</title> contains some   of the most characteristic passages:-- <QUOTE>Nay,</QUOTE> says Littlewit, <QUOTE>we'll be humble enough, we'll seek out the homeliest booth in the fair, that's certain; rather than fail, we'll eat it on the ground.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Aye,</QUOTE> adds Dame 
<L>Purecroft, <QUOTE>and I'll go with you myself.   Win-the-Fight and my brother, Zeal-of-the-Land, shall go with us, too, for our better consolation.</QUOTE> Then says the Rabbi, <QUOTE>In the way of comfort to the weak, I will go and eat. I will eat exceedingly, and prophecy. There may be a good use made of it, too, now I think on't, by the public eating of swine's flesh, to profess our hate and loathing of Judaism, whereof the brethren stand taxed. I will therefore eat, yea, I will eat exceedingly.</QUOTE> So these also set off for the fair. In the fair, as I have said, is Justice Overdue, solemnly establishing himself as a fool, for the benefit of public morals. There are the booths and stalls. There is prosperous Lanthorn Leatherhead, the hobby-horse man, who cries, <QUOTE>What do you lack?   What is't you buy?   What do you lack? Rattles, drums, halberts, horses, babies o&lsquo; the best, fiddles of the finest!</QUOTE> He is a too proud pedler, owner also of a famous puppet-show, the manager, indeed, for whom Proctor Littlewit has sacrificed to the Bartholomew muses. Joan Trash, the gingerbread-woman, keeps her stall near him, and the rival traders have their differences. <QUOTE>Do you hear, Sister Trash, lady of the basket! sit farther with your gingerbread progeny, there, and hinder not the prospect of my shop, or I'll have it proclaimed in the fair what stuff they <pb id="P.346" n="346"> are made on.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Why, what stuff are they made on, Brother Leatherhead?

<P>In <title>Wit and Drollery: Jovial Poems,</title> <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct>, the writer has hit off several of the chief rarities of the fair :

<P>In the year <datestruct value="1698"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>, a Frenchman, Monsieur Sore biere, visiting London, says, <QUOTE>I was at Bartholomew Fair.   It consists mostly of toy-shops, also finery and pictures, ribbon-shops--no books; many shops of confectioners, where any woman may commodiously be treated. Knavery is here in perfection, dextrous cutpurses and pickpockets.   I went to see the dancing on the ropes, which was admirable.   Coming out, I met a man that would have took off my hat, but I secured it, and was going to draw my sword, crying,  <Q>Begar!   You rogue!   Morbleu!</Q>  &amp;c., when on   a sudden   I had a <num value="100">hundred</num> people about me crying,  <Q>Here, monsieur, see <hi rend=italics>Jephthah's Rash Vow</hi>.</Q>   <Q> Here, monsieur, see the Tall Dutchwoman.</Q>   <Q>See The Tiger,</Q>  says another.    <Q>See the Horse and no Horse, whose tail stands where his head should do.</Q>   <Q>See the German Artist, monsieur.</Q>   <Q>See <hi rend=italics>The Siege of Namur</hi>.</Q>  So that betwixt rudeness and civility I was forced to get into <hi rend=italics>afiacre</hi>, and with an air of haste and a full trot, got home to my lodgings.</QUOTE> 
<P>In <datestruct value="1702--"><year reg="1702">1702</year></datestruct>, the following advertisement appeared relative to the fair:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote>At the Great Booth over against the Hospital Gate, in Bartholomew Fair, will be seen the famous company of ropedancers, they being the greatest performers of men, women, and children that can be found beyond the seas, so that the world cannot parallel them for dancing on the low rope, vaulting on the high rope, and for walking on the slack and sloaping ropes, outdoing all others to that degree, that it has highly recommended them, both in Bartholomew Fair and May Fair last, to all the best persons of quality in England. And by all are owned to be the only amazing wonders of the world in everything they do. It is there you will see the Italian Scaramouch dancing on the rope, with a wheelbarrow before him with <num value="2">two</num> children and a dog in it, and with a duck on his head, who sings to the company, and causes much laughter.   The whole entertainment will be so extremely fine and diverting, as never was done by any but this company alone.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Ned Ward, as the   <title>London   Spy,</title> went, of course, to the fair, but in a coach, to escape the dirt and the crowd, and at the entrance he says he was <QUOTE>saluted with Belphegor's concert, the rumbling of drums, mixed with   the intolerable squeaking of catcalls and penny trumpets, made still more terrible with the shrill belches of lottery pickpockets through instruments of the same metal with their faces.</QUOTE> The spy having been set down with his friend at the hospital gate, went into a convenient house, to smoke a pipe and drink small beer bittered with colocynth.   From   <num value="1">one</num> of its windows he looked down on a crowd rushing, ankle-deep in filth, through an air tainted by fumes of tobacco and of singeing, over-roasted pork, to <pb id="P.347" n="347"> see the Merry Andrew.   On their galleries strutted, in their buffoonery of stateliness, the quality of the fair, dressed in tinsel robes and golden leather buskins. <QUOTE>When they had taken a turn the length of their gallery, to show the gaping crowd how majestically they could tread, each ascended to a seat agreeable to the dignity of their dress, to show the multitude how imperiously they could sit.</QUOTE> 
<P>A few years before this the fair is sketched by Sir Robert Southwell, in a letter to his son (<datestruct VALUE="1685-08-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>). <QUOTE>Here,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>you see the rope-dancers gett their living meerly by hazarding of their lives; and why men will pay money and take pleasure to see such dangers, is of separate and philosophical consideration. You have others who are acting fools, drunkards, and madmen, but for the same wages which they might get by honest labour, and live with credit besides. Others, if born in any monstrous shape, or have children that are such, here they celebrate their misery,   and, by getting of money, forget how odious they   are made. When you see the toy-shops, <hi rend=italics>and</hi> the strange variety of things much more impertinent than hobby-horses of ginger-bread, you must know there are customers for all these matters; and it would be a pleasing sight could you see painted a true figure of all these impertinent minds and their fantastic passions, who come trudging hither only for such things. &lsquo;Tis out of this credulous crowd that the ballad-singers attrackt an assembly, who listen and admire, while their confederate pickpockets   are diving and fishing for their prey. 
<P>&lsquo;Tis from those of this number who are more refined that the mountebank obtains audience and credit; and it were a good bargain if such customers had nothing for their   money but words, but they are best content to pay   for druggs and medicines, which commonly doe them hurt.    There is <num value="1">one</num> corner of this Elizium field devoted to the eating of pig and the surfeits that attend it. The fruits of the season <hi rend=italics>are</hi> everywhere   scattered about, and those who eat imprudently do but hasten to the physitian or the churchyard.</QUOTE>
 
<P> <QUOTE>In the year <datestruct value="1727"><year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct>-<num value="28">28</num>,</QUOTE> says Mr. Morley, <QUOTE>Gay's 
<title>Beggar's Opera</title> was produced, and took the foremost place among the pleasures of the town. It took a foremost place also among the pleasures of the next Bartholomew Fair, being acted during the time of the fair by the company of comedians from the new theatre in the Haymarket, at the  <Q>George</Q>  Inn in Smithfield.   William   Penkethman, <num value="1">one</num> of the actors who had become famous as a boothmanager, was then recently dead, and the Haymarket comedians carried the <title>Beggar's Opera</title> out of Bartholomew into Southwark Fair, where  <Q>the late Mr. Penkethman's great theatrical booth</Q>  afforded them a stage.   <num value="1">One</num> of the managers of this specula tion was Henry Fielding, then only just of age, a young man who, with good birth, fine wit, and a liberal education, both at Eton and at Leyden University, was left to find his own way in the world.

The man at the door pops in his head, and makes a loud   inquiry for  <QUOTE>John Audley.</QUOTE>  The ingenious contriver of this device is the Shuter who finds a place in <title>The Rosciad</title> of Churchill: 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Shuter, who never cared a single pin

<P> <QUOTE>There   lived,</QUOTE> says Mr. Morley, <QUOTE>about this time a popular Merry Andrew, who sold gingerbread nuts in the neighbourhood of Covent Garden, and because he received a guinea a day for his fun during the fair, he was at pains never to cheapen himself by laughing, or by noticing a joke, during the other <num value="362">362</num>   days of the year.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>Garrick's   name,</QUOTE> says the same writer, <QUOTE>is connected with the fair only by stories that regard him   as   a visitor out of another world.     He offers his money at the entrance   of a theatrical   booth, and it is thought a   jest worth transmitting to posterity that he is told by   the checktaker,  <Q>We never takes money of <num value="1">one</num> another.</Q>  He sees <num value="1">one</num> of his own sturdy Drury Lane porters installed at a booth-door, where he is pressed sorely in the crowd, and calls for help.    <Q>It's no use,</Q>  he is told,  <Q>I   can't help you.

<P>In <title>Oliver Twist</title> Dickens sketches with his peculiar power the dangerous neighbourhood of Smithfield, which lay between Islington and Saffron Hill, the lurking-place of the Sykeses and Fagins of <num value="30">thirty</num> years ago : 
<P> <QUOTE>As John Dawkins,</QUOTE> says Dickens, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>objected to their entering London before nightfall, it was nearly <num value="11">eleven</num> o&lsquo;clock before they reached the <pb id="P.348" n="348"> turnpike at Islington. They crossed from the  <Q>Angel</Q>  into St. John's Road, struck down the small street which terminates at Sadler's Wells Theatre, through Exmouth Street and Coppice Row, down the little court by the side of the workhouse, across the classic ground which once bore the name of Hockley-in-the-Hole, thence into Little Saffron Hill, and so into Saffron Hill the Great, along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace, directing Oliver to follow close at his heels. 
<P>Although Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way, as he passed along. A dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen. The street was 
<FIGURE id="Fig.348" n="2000.07.0127"><HEAD>The Church Of St. Bartholomew-The-Great, <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 very narrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated with filthy odours. There were a good many small shops, but the only stock-in-trade appeared to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were crawling in and out at the doors, or screaming from the inside. The sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place were the public-houses, and in them the lowest orders of Irish were wrangling with might and main. Covered ways and yards, which here and there diverged from the main street, disclosed little knots of houses where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in the filth, and from   several of the doorways great, ill-looking fellows were cautiously emerging, bound, to all <pb id="P.349" n="349"> appearance, upon no very well-disposed or harmless errands.</QUOTE>
 
<P>The enormous sale of roast pork at Bartholomew Fair ceased, says Mr. Morley, with all the gravity of a historian, about the middle of the last century, and   beef sausages then became the fashion. Thomas Rowlandson's droll but gross pictures of the shows, in <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, show those sickening boatswings and crowds of rough and boisterous sightseers. He writes on <num value="1">one</num> of the show-boards the name of Miss Biffin, that   clever woman   who, through the Earl of Morton's patronage, succeeded in earning a name as a miniature painter, though born without either hands or arms. In <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct> George III. paid for her more complete artistic education, and William IV. gave her a small pension, after which she married, and, at the Earl of Morton's request, left the fair caravans for good. 
<P>This great carnival, a dangerous sink for all the vices of London, was gradually growing unbearable. In <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct> a mob of thieves surrounded any respectable woman, and tore her clothes from her back.

 came to their windows with lights, alarmed at the disturbance. In <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct> the place grew even more lawless, and a virago of an actress, who was performing Belvidera in <title>Venice Preserved</title>, knocked down the august king's deputy-trumpeter, who applied for his fees.

The great fair at last sank down to a few gilt gingerbread booths. In <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct> the fair had so withered away that there were only a dozen gingerbread stalls. The ceremony of opening since <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct> had been very simple, and in <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct> Lord Mayor Musgrove, going to read the parchment proclamation at the appointed gateway, found that the fair had vanished.   <num value="5">Five</num> years later the ceremony   entirely   ceased, but the old fee of <measure value="3s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> was still paid by the City to the rector of St. Bartholomew-the-Great, for a proclamation in his parish. The fair had outlived its original purpose. 
<P>Smithfield Market was condemned in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct> by law to   be moved to Islington, the noise, filth, and dangers of the place having at last become intolerable, and half a century having been spent in discussing the annoyance. 
<P> <QUOTE>The original extent of Smithfield,</QUOTE> says Mr. Timbs, <QUOTE>was about <num value="3">three</num> acres; the market-place was paved, drained, and railed in, <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>; subsequently enlarged to <num value="4">four</num> and a half acres, and since <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct> to <num value="6">six</num> and a quarter acres. Yet this enlargement proved disproportionate to the requirements. In <datestruct value="1731--"><year reg="1731">1731</year></datestruct> there were only <num value="8304">8,304</num> head of cattle sold in Smithfield; in <datestruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct>, <num value="210757">210,757</num> head of cattle, and <num value="1518510">1,518,510</num> sheep.

<P>The old market-days were, Monday for fat cattle and sheep; Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, for hay and straw; Friday, cattle and sheep, and milch cows; and at <num value="2">two</num> o'clock for scrub-horses and asses.

Smithfield salesmen estimated the weight of cattle by the eye, and from constant practice they approached so near exactness that they were seldom out more than a few pounds.

<P>The miseries of old Smithfield are described by Mr. Dickens, in   <title>Oliver Twist,</title> in   his most powerful manner. <QUOTE>It was market morning,</QUOTE> he says; <QUOTE>the ground was covered nearly ankle-deep with filth and mire, and a thick steam perpetually rising from   the reeking bodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog which seemed to rest upon the chimney-tops, hung heavily above.   All the pens in the centre of the large area, and as many temporary ones as could   be crowded into the vacant space, were filled with sheep; and tied up to posts by the gutter-side were long   lines   of oxen, <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> deep.   Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a dense mass.   The whistling of drovers, the barking of dogs, the bellowing and plunging of beasts, the bleating of sheep, and grunting and squeaking of pigs; the cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling on all sides, the ringing of bells, and the roar of voices that issued from every public-house, the crowding, pushing, driving, beating, whooping, and yelling, the hideous and discordant din that resounded from every corner of the market, and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty figures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the throng, rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite confused the senses.</QUOTE> 
<P>Smithfield Market, on a foggy, rainy morning in November, some <num value="25">twenty-five</num> years ago (says Aleph), was a sight to be remembered by any who had ventured through it.   It might be called a feat of clever agility to get across Smithfield, on such a greasy, muddy day, without slipping   down, or without being knocked over by <num value="1">one</num> of the poor frightened and half-mad cattle toiling through it.   The noise was deafening.   The   bellowing and   lowing of cattle, bleating of sheep, squeaking of pigs, the shouts of the drovers, and often, the shrieks of some unfortunate female who had got amongst the unruly, frightened cattle, could not be forgotten The long, <pb id="P.351" n="351"> narrow lanes of pavement that crossed the wider part of the market, opposite the hospital, were always lined with cattle, as close together as they could stand, their heads tied to the rails on either side of the scanty pathway, when the long horns of the Spanish breeds, sticking across towards the other side, made it far from a pleasant experience for a nervous man to venture along <num value="1">one</num> of these narrow lanes, albeit it was the nearest and most direct way across the open market. If the day was foggy (and there were more foggy days then than now), then the glaring lights of the drover-boys' torches added to the wild confusion, whilst it did not dispel much of the gloom. It was indeed a very great change for the better when at last the City authorities removed the market into the suburbs. 
<P>In <datestruct VALUE="1849-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>, during excavations necessary for a new sewer, and at a depth of <num value="3">three</num> feet below the surface, immediately opposite the entrance to the church of St. Bartholomew-the-Great, the workmen laid open a mass of unhewn stones, blackened as if by fire, and covered with ashes and human bones, charred and partially consumed.. This was believed to have been the spot generally used for the Smithfield burnings, the face of the victim being turned to the east and to the great gate of St. Bartholomew, the prior of which was generally present on such occasions.   Many bones were carried away as relics. Some strong oak posts were also dug up, they had evidently been charred by fire, and in <num value="1">one</num> of them was a staple with a ring attached to it. The place and its former history were too significant for any doubt to exist as to how they had been once used. Gazing upon them thoughtfully, <num value="1">one</num> was forcibly reminded of the last words of Bishop Latimer to his friend Ridley, as they stood bound to the stake at Oxford: <QUOTE>Be of good comfort; Master Ridley, and play the than; we shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.</QUOTE> And the good Latimer's words have come true. 
<P>Some years ago, on removing the foundations of some old houses, on the south side of Long Lane, a considerable quantity of human remains were discovered-skulls and other portions of the skeletons. This spot was understood to be the north-west corner of; the burying-ground of the ancient priory of St. Bartholomew. The skulls were thick and grim-looking, with heavy, massive jaws, just as <num value="1">one</num> would expect to find in those sturdy old monks, who were the schoolmen, artists, and sages of their time.

<P>In <datestruct value="1410--"><year reg="1410">1410</year></datestruct>, when the priory was rebuilt, it was entirely enclosed with walls, the boundaries of which have been carefully traced out by many diligent antiquaries. The north wall ran from Smithfield along the south side of Long Lane, to its junction with the east wall, about <num value="30">thirty</num> yards west from Aldersgate Street. This wall is mentioned by Stow, and delineated by Aggas, who has marked a small postern gate in it, which stood opposite Charterhouse Square, where there is now (says a writer in <datestruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct>) the entrance to King Street, Cloth Fair. The west wall commenced at the south-west corner of Long Lane, and continued along Smithfield and the middle of Duc Lane (now Duke Street) to the south gate, or Great Gate House, now the principal entrance to Bartholomew Close. The south wall, starting from this spot, ran eastward in a direct line to Aldersgate Street, where it formed an angle, and passed southwards about <num value="40">forty</num> yards, then resumed again its eastern course, and joined the corner of the east wall, which ran parallel with Aldersgate Street, at the distance of about <num value="26">twenty-six</num> yards.   The priory wall was fronted by the houses of Aldersgate Street, London House among others, between which and   the wall ran a ditch. At the demolition of this wall various encroachments took place, which led to great disputes (especially   in <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>) about the boundaries between the privileged parish of St. Bartholomew and the City.   The old privileges of Rayer's Priory and precinct were, that the parishioners were not to serve on juries, and could <pb id="P.352" n="352"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.352.1">Appeal for St. Bartholomew-Apse and Blacksmith's Shop</LEMMA></NOTE>
 appoint their own constables; paid few City rates, taxed themselves, and were not required to become free of the City on starting in business. 
<P>When, in <datestruct value="1539--"><year reg="1539">1539</year></datestruct>, Sir Richard Rich purchased the church and priory for <measure value="1064l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1064">1,064</num></measure> <measure value="11s. 3d." type=Currency><num value="11">11</num>s. <num value="3">3</num>d.</measure>, the <num value="13">thirteen</num> frozen-out canons received annuities of <measure value="6l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6">6</num></measure> <measure value="13s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="13">13</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> each.   Queen Mary granted the church to the Black Friars, but they had but a short reign, and the Riches, Earls of Warwick and Holland, came again into unrighteous possession. The priory, at the dissolution, was valued at <measure value="653l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="653">653</num></measure> <measure value="15s." type=currency><num value="15">15</num>s.</measure> a year. The revenues were principally derived from small houses in the parishes of St. Nicholas and St. Sepulchre, and also from country property, such as land at Stanmore, and in Canonbury, as before mentioned.   The chantries were very rich, and the alms and oblations were abundant. The old seals of the priory, necessary to render legal any alienation of rents or possessions, were kept by the prior under <num value="3">three</num> keys, which were in charge of the prior and <num value="2">two</num> brethren specially chosen. The earliest seals of the priory which are preserved are attached to a life grant of the church of St. Sepulchre, from Rayer to Haymon, priest, and is dated <datestruct value="1137--"><year reg="1137">1137</year></datestruct>. The seal of the reign of Edward III. represents St. Bartholomew standing on a lion, holding a knife (symbol of martyrdom) in his left hand, and a book in his right. On either side of him is a shield, on on which are <num value="3">three</num> lions, guardant, passant. This was the common seal of the hospital. On the seal of <datestruct value="1341--"><year reg="1341">1341</year></datestruct>, St. Bartholomew is seated on a throne, holding a knife (so appropriate to the locality) in his left hand; around him are the heavens, with moon in crescent, and <num value="12">twelve</num> stars; on the reverse is a boat, with a church in it. In what was probably the last seal, the saint stands under a canopy, which is supported by <num value="2">two</num> pillars. 
<P>The ruins of the old priory were less hidden and obliterated when the writer on the Priory and Church of St. Bartholomew in Knight's <title>London</title>
 searched for them than they are now. The present church is merely the choir of the old priory church. Its front was probably originally in a line with the small gateway yet remaining, and which formerly led to the southern aisle of the nave, now entirely destroyed. <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.352.2">The gateway</LEMMA> was a finely-fronted arch of <num value="4">four</num> ribs, each with receding mouldings, alternating with Norman zigzag ornaments, springing from a cluster of sculptured heads. In Knight's time the south wall, once the wall of the south aisle, belonged to a public-house which had rooms with arched ceilings, a cornice with a shield extending through <num value="3">three</num> of them, and a chalk cellar. These had belonged to the priory. Among costermongers' houses and sheds, and near a smith's workshop, were the arches of the east cloister. The roof and part of the wall fell in many years ago, but <num value="5">five</num> arches of the east and <num value="1">one</num> of the west side still remained. A fine Norman arch leading into the aisle was walled up. In several parts of the ruins of the cloister the groins and key-stones and elaborately carved devices were still visible. It was calculated by the writer in Knight's <title>London</title>
 that <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.352.3">the cloisters of St. Bartholomew's</LEMMA> were nearly <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet broad, and have extended round the <num value="4">four</num> sides of a square of nearly <num value="100">100</num> feet. 
<P>The same writer describes the refectory of the priory, then a tobacco-manufactory, divided into <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> stories, as originally a room some <num value="40">forty</num> feet high, <num value="30">thirty</num> feet broad, and <num value="120">120</num> feet long, finely roofed with oak. The ceilings and floors of the <num value="3">three</num> stories were evidently temporary, and formed of huge timbers plucked from   the original roof. The crypt, which ran below   the refectory, still exists. It is of immense length, with a double row of beautiful aisles, and in perfect preservation. A door in this vault is traditionally supposed to lead to Canonbury.   Perhaps, says <num value="1">one</num> writer, it was really used as a mode of escape by the Nonconformist ministers who occupied the adjoining chapel during part of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> and <num value="17">seventeenth</num> centuries. <QUOTE>It opened till lately,</QUOTE> says Mr. Delamotte, in <datestruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>into   a cellar that extended beneath the chapel, and where the fire broke out, in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, that destroyed the latter, and some other interesting parts of the old priory.</QUOTE> The chapel formed part of the monastic buildings, but what part, is unknown. It had an ancient timber roof, and a beam projecting across near the centre, and in a corner there is said to have been an antique piece of sculpture, representing a priest with a child in his arms (probably some saint and the infant Jesus).   In several parts of the walls were marks of private doors.   This chapel had been   occupied   by   Presbyterian   ministers till <datestruct value="1753"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct>, when Wesley obtained possession of it, and opened it for his followers. It is supposed that Lord Rich's house occupied the site of the prior's stables and wood-yard, and that an old house with a vaulted ceiling and a fine carved mantelpiece marks the spot, near Middlesex Passage, where the mulberry-garden stood, the last tree in which was cut down about <datestruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct>. 
<P>At the back of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.352.4">the present church</LEMMA> and between it and Red Lion Passage, stood the   prior's house. It may still be traced by its massive walls, square flat pillars, and fluted capitals, and the old dormitory, which some years ago was occupied by gimpspinners.   There are also remains of the south transept, and the ruins still heaped there comprise 
<NOTE RESP=B><P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.352.5">Ruins of Old Priory</LEMMA></NOTE>
 <pb id="P.353" n="353"> 
<NOTE resp=b><p><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.353.1">South Ambulatory</LEMMA>
<p><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.353.2">Facsimile of ordinance of Bishop concerning St. Bartholomew's</LEMMA></NOTE>
 also the chapter-house, which stood between the old vestry and the transept. There were traces formerly of the once beautiful arch, that led into the chapter-house, and there is also a fragment of the wall of the transept. The picturesque-looking low porch, with its deep pent-house, says <num value="1">one</num> writer on the subject, now the entrance into the church from the transept, was formerly an entrance into St. Bartholomew's Chapel. In Cloth Fair a narrow passage points to the position of the north transept. Extending from the sides of the choir north and south, and partly over the aisles, were buildings used as schools; that on the south was burnt in the fire of <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>; the other still exists, and it contains <num value="2">two</num> of the fine circular arches that form the <num value="2">second</num> tier of the choir. 
<P>Within the porch of St. Bartholomew's are the remains of a very elegant pointed arch, that probably led into the cloisters.   The aisles are separated from the choir by solid pillars and square piers indifferently, from   which spring <num value="5">five</num> semicircular arches on either side. The arches next the choir are adorned with billet moulding, which does not cease with the arch, but, in some places, is continued horizontally over the cap of the column, until it meets the next arch. The triforium   has similar arches, each opening being divided. Into <num value="4">four</num> compartments by small Norman columns and arches, formerly bricked up, but now re-opened. The prior's state pew is a bay, or oriel, probably added by Prior Bolton, on the south side. His rebus is upon it. This oriel communicated with the priory, and was where the prior assisted at the service, in all the pride of feigned humility, and from   this point of vantage he could watch his <num value="13">thirteen</num> canons. There are similar oriels, says Mr. Godwin, in Malmesbury Abbey, and in Exeter Cathedral. 
<P>There is a     clerestory <NOTE RESP=B><P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.353.3">interior</LEMMA></NOTE> above the triforium, with pointed windows, and a passage the whole length of the building.   The roof is of timber, divided into compartments by a tie-beam   and king-post, the corbels resting on angels' heads. There also remains a portion of the transepts. 
<P> <QUOTE><num value="1">One</num> of the most interesting features of the choir,</QUOTE> says Mr. Delamotte, <QUOTE>is the long-continued aisle, or series of aisles, which entirely encircle it, opening into the former by the spaces between the flat and circular arch-piers of the body of the structure. It is about <num value="12">twelve</num> feet wide, with a pure arched and vaulted ceiling, in the simplest and truest Norman style, and with windows of different sizes, slightly pointed. The pillars against the wall, opposite the entrance into the choir, are flat, apparently made so for the convenience of the sitters. <num value="1">One</num> of the most beautiful little architectural effects, of a simple kind that we can conceive is to be found at the north-eastern corner of the aisle. Between <num value="2">two</num> of the grand Norman pillars, projecting from the wall, is a low postern doorway, and above, rising on each side from the capitals, a peculiarly elegant arch, something like an elongated horseshoe. The connection   between <num value="2">two</num> styles so strikingly different in most respects, as the Moorish, with its fantastic delicacy (?), variety, and richness, and the Norman, with its simple (occasionally uncouth) grandeur, was never more apparent. That little picture is alone worth a visit to St. Bartholomew's.</QUOTE> The postern leads into a curious place, enclosed by the end of the choir (or altar end) on <num value="1">one</num> side, and the circular wall of the eastern aisle on the other. It is supposed by Mr. Godwin to have been the chancel of the original building, and no doubt it was, if we are to suppose that the altar wall has undergone great changes. At present the space is so narrow, and so dark, that it need not surprise us to hear that it is called the Purgatory. We have no doubt that this part has been visible, in some way, from the choir, and not, as it is now, entirely excluded from it; for a pair of exactly similar pillars, with a beautiful arch above, standing at the south-east corner of the aisle, are, in a great measure, shut in here. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.353.4">The monument of Rayer (or Rahere)</LEMMA>, the founder of the priory, the pious jester of Henry I., is in the north-east corner of the church, next the altar, and almost exactly opposite Prior Bolton's beautiful oriel window. Bolton restored this tomb with pious care, and may have placed his window so as to command a perpetual view of that <hi rend=italics>memento mori</hi>. This monument is of a much later date than the period of Rayer's death. It consists of a highly-wrought stone screen, of pointed Gothic, enclosing a tomb, on which, under a canopy, rests the prior's effigy. The roof of the tomb is exquisitely groined. Except a few of the pinnacles, the monument is still uninjured, and Time has watched kindly over the good man's grave. A crowned angel kneels at Rayer's feet, and monks of his order pray by his side. Each of the monks has a Bible before him, open at Isa. li., which contains the following verse, so applicable to the church built on the marsh:-- <QUOTE>The Lord shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>Besides the choir of the old church,</QUOTE> says Mr. Godwin, <QUOTE>there remains a portion of the transepts, <pb id="P.354" n="354"> and of the nave, at their junction with it, over which rose a tower. At the commencement of each transept, a large arch, spanning its whole width, springs from the capitals of slender clustered columns, and, at the end of the nave and commencement of the choir, other arches (the width of the church) spring from corbels, sculptured to represent the capitals of similar columns. The <num value="4">four</num> arches are surrounded by zigzag ornaments. Of these arches, those at the intersection of the transepts are pointed, and have been referred to as among the various instances of the <hi rend=italics>incidental</hi> use made of the pointed arch in early buildings, before it became a component part of a system, at least in England.</QUOTE> . <QUOTE>The cause for this,</QUOTE> says Mr. Britton, the famous antiquary, <QUOTE>was evident; for those sides of the tower being much narrower than the east and west divisions, which are formed of semicircular arches, it became necessary to carry the arches of the former to a point, in order to suit the oblong plan of the intersection, and, at the same time, make the upper mouldings and lines range with the corresponding members of the circular arches.</QUOTE>

<P>Beyond is a sumptuous and curious transitional monument, half-classic, half-Gothic, in memory of Sir Walter Mildmay, <datestruct value="1689--"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>. This gentleman, the generous founder of Emanuel College, Cambridge, held offices under Henry VIII. and Edward VI.; and, though not compliant enough, was made by Elizabeth Chancellor of the Exchequer.

<P>In the spandrils of some of the arches of this church there are ornaments which resemble the Grecian honeysuckle, and which are unusual in Gothic work. A small bit of the old nave is now used as the organ-loft; and over what was once part of the aisle of the nave rises the poor brick tower, built in <datestruct value="1628--"><year reg="1628">1628</year></datestruct>. The vestry-room is part of the south transept, and a magnificent chapel once stood on the east side of this transept. When the ill-judged classic altar-piece was taken down, some years ago; the stone wall was found painted bright red, and spotted with black stars. The chamber between the choir and the east aisle, early in this century, contained several <num value="1000">thousand</num> bones. 
<P>Near the junction of the south and east aisles is the old vestry-room, a solemn, ancient place, probably once an oratory. The present vestry, a mere place for registers and surplices, is built over the southern aisle. Here is a beautiful Norman semicircular arch, forming <num value="1">one</num> of a range of arches by which the <num value="2">second</num> storey   of the choir was probably continued at a right angle along the sides of the transept. Among the monuments of the aisles is <num value="1">one</num> in the form of a rose, with an inscription to Abigail Coult, <datestruct value="1629--"><year reg="1629">1629</year></datestruct>, who died <QUOTE>in the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> year of her virginity.</QUOTE> Her father, Maximilian Coult, or Colte, was a famous sculptor of the time, and was employed by James I. in various public buildings.

There appears to have been attached to the northern aisle-probably corresponding in position with the old vestry-another chapel. 
<P>In Walden Chapel, on the north side of the altar, Roger Walden, Bishop of London, was buried (instead of in St. Paul's-but why, no <num value="1">one</num> can guess). <QUOTE>Never had any man,</QUOTE> says Weever, <QUOTE>better experience of the uncertainty of worldly felicity.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Raised,</QUOTE> says Mr. Delamotte, <QUOTE>from   the condition of a poor man by his industry and ability, he became successively Dean of York, Treasurer of Calais, Secretary to the King, and Treasurer of England. When Archbishop Arundel fell under the displeasure of Richard II., and was banished, Walden was made Primate of England. On the return of Arundel, in company with Bolingbroke, and the ascent of the latter to the throne, Arundel of course resumed his archiepiscopal rank and functions, and   Roger Walden became again a private individual,   Arundel, however, behaved very nobly to the man whom he must have looked on as a usurper of his place, for he conferred on him   the bishopric of London. Walden did not live long to be grateful for this very honourable and kindly act, for he died within the ensuing year,  <Q>He may be compared to <num value="1">one</num> so jaw-fallen,</Q>  says Fuller, in his usual quaint, homely style,  <Q>with overlong fasting; that he cannot eat meat when brought unto him; and his spirits were so depressed with his former ill-fortunes, that he could not enjoy himself in his new unexpected happiness.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P>In St. Bartholomew-the-Great was buried, in <datestruct value="1623--"><year reg="1623">1623</year></datestruct>, Dr. Francis Anthony, i learned physician and chemist of the reign of James I., who was frequently fined and imprisoned by the London College of Physicians for practising physic without a licence. Dr. Anthony, who seems to have been a generous and honest man, prided himself on the discovery of a universal medicine, which he called <hi rend=italics>aurumpotabile</hi>, or potable gold, which he mixed with mercury. 
<P> <QUOTE>Dr. Anthony,</QUOTE> says Mr. Delamotte, <QUOTE>published a very learned and modest defence of himself and his <hi rend=italics>aurum potable</hi>, in Latin, written with great decency, much skill in chemistry, and with an apparent knowledge in the theory and practice of physic. In the preface he says  <Q>that after inexpressible labour, watching, and expense, he had, through the blessing of God, attained all he had sought for in his inquiries.</Q>  In the <num value="2">second</num> chapter of his work he affirms that his medicine is a kind of extract or honey of gold, capable of being dissolved in any liquor whatsoever, and referring to the common objection of the affinity between the 
<hi rend=italics>aurum potabile</hi> and the philosopher's stone, does not deny the transmutation of metals, but still shows that there is a great difference between the <num value="2">two</num>, and that the finding or not finding of the <num value="1">one</num> does not at all render it inevitable that the other shall also be discovered, or remain hidden. The price of the medicine was <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure> an ounce. Wonderful cures, of course, are displayed in the doctor's pages. His publication produced quite a controversy on the merits of <hi rend=italics>aurum   potabile</hi>.   We need not wonder to find that Dr. Anthony had implicit believers in the value of his nostrum, when we see the great chemist and philosopher, Boyle, thus commenting on such preparations:  <Q>Though I have long been prejudiced against the pretended <foreign lang=la>aurum potabile</foreign>, and other boasted preparations of gold, for most of which I have still no great esteem, yet I saw such extraordinary and surprising effects from the tincture of gold I spake of (prepared by <num value="2">two</num> foreign physicians) upon persons of great note with whom I was particularly acquainted, both before they fell <pb id="P.357" n="357"> desperately sick and after their strange recovery that I could not but change my opinion for a very favourable <num value="1">one</num> as to some preparations of gold.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P>A local antiquary, who is as learned as he i imaginative, has furnished us with some notes on the priory and its neighbourhood, of which we gladly avail ourselves:-- 
<P> <QUOTE>Excepting the tower and its immediate neigh bourhood,</QUOTE> says the writer, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>there is no part of London, old or new, around which are clustered so many events interesting in history, as that o the Priory of St. Bartholomew-the-Great, and its vicinity. There are narrow, tortuous streets, and still narrower courts, about Cloth Fair, where are hidden away scores of old houses, whose pro jecting eaves and overhanging floors, heavy cumbrous beams, and wattle and plaster walls, must have seen the days of the Plantagenets and the earlier Tudors.   There are remains of groined arches, and windows with ancient tracery, strong buttresses, and beautiful portals, with toothed and ornate archways, belonging to times long anterior to Wycliffe and John of Gaunt, yet to be found lurking behind dark, uncanny-looking tenements. To the real lover of the past history of our great City; to the earnest inquirer into the rise and progress of our present civilisation; to the pious student of the earlier times of our English Church, and her struggles after freedom, there is no part of modern London that will better reward a careful survey than that now under our consideration. 
<P>Note that dark archway yonder. Fully <num value="7">seven</num> centuries have passed since the hand of some good lay brother traced its bold outline, and worked with cunning mallet and chisel the beautiful beading and its toothed ornaments. And in the old times, when Chaucer was young, and his Canterbury Pilgrims were men and women of the period, processions of cowled monks and chanting boys, with censers and crucifix, wended their way from the old priory to that of the Black Friars, by the Thames; and not unfrequently, when Edward III. and his favourite Alice Pierce had spent the morning in witnessing the tournay of mailed knights in Smithfield, have they and their attendants, with all the pomp and pageantry of chivalry, passed beneath this old gateway to the grand entertainments provided by the good prior for their delectation, in the great refectory beyond the south cloisters. Rhenish and Cyprus wines, with sack and strong waters, were there in plenty, and geese, swans, bustards, and lordly peacocks, graced the well-filled board, with venison pasties and the boar's head ready at hand; whilst all such fruits as were then naturalised amongst us were reared by the careful fathers in their garden at Canonbury, for the use of the good prior's table. 
<P>In later years the solemn, weather-worn stones of this old archway have had sad scenes to frown upon, and yet, nearer our own day, merry parties have gambolled and frisked beneath the ancient portal, as they wended their way to the pandemonium of mirth and folly in Bartholomew Fair. 
<P>In the Great Close, where is now a row of dilapidated houses, was once the west cloister of the priory, and here, as we turn, was the south cloister, just beyond which was, until quite lately, the remains of the great refectory. Beneath it was much of the ancient crypt, with its deep groined arches, more than half buried under the debris of ages. Some portion of this is still left us, beneath the modern buildings erected on the spot. 
<P>As we go round the Great Close, towards the other end of the church, we pass by some very old houses, that occupy the place where was once the east cloisters. Behind these houses used to be a great mulberry-tree, only removed in our own time. This was formerly the centre of the cloister court. You fancy you see a tall, bareheaded man, in monkish garb of grey, his rosary dangling by his side, as he stands near a pillar of the cloister, deeply immersed in the breviary he holds in his hand.   See his sandled feet, and his long grey beard; he is the personal friend of the good Prior Rayer. Now he moves, and silently steps across the grass towards the big mulberry-tree, where he sits down upon a stone seat beneath its umbrageous branches, and laying down his book, he takes from the folds of his habit a scroll. Slowly he unrolls it, and carefully studies the curious lines, curves, and ornaments drawn thereon. That old monk is the good Alfune, the builder of St. Giles's, Cripplegate. 
<P>See here, is the prior's house, its big stones hidden under a casing of bricks and stucco, whilst here and there, like big rocks, a buttress crops out, an enormity quite unsuited to the gingerbread buildings of modern times. But these good monkish architects built more for the future than for themselves. Look above: there, where is now a row of windows to a fringe factory was once the dormitory, or  <Q>dormite,</Q>  of the monks. They needed lookingafter sometimes, so the prior wisely kept them near himself at night. 
<P>Let us go along this dark and narrow passage. Now we are in <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.358.1">Cloth Fair</LEMMA>.   This is where the ancient cloth fair was held, to which came merchants from Flanders and Italy, with their precious wares for the sons and daughters of old London. How aged some of these houses are! floor leaning over floor, until you may fancy they are toppling <pb id="P.358" n="358"> upon you. Now come with me under this low gateway, and take my hand, for it is quite dark here, and we must walk in Indian file, the space is so narrow. Between the houses and the low wall, as your eyes become used to the deep gloom, you will notice that the <num value="1">first</num> floor entirely covers the narrow court behind, and is supported on posts, and the next leaning over the <num value="1">one</num> beneath it. These houses have seen many generations of tenants, and in some of them the old cloth business is still carried on. Now peep over the wall on your left. You will find the level much lower there, for they have lately been clearing away some of the accumulated rubbish, and <Q>dust and ashes</Q> of past ages, and have exposed to view some beautiful windows, that formed part of the prior's house, perhaps the infirmary, or  <Q>firmary,</Q>  as that was under the same roof, or a portion of the crypt, used for such a purpose mayhap. Past these very windows the old priors of the monastery must have gone to the service in the church. Let us follow, and note, as we step into the ancient Norman aisle, the finely-curved semicircular arches, and the curious nooks and crannies, only to be found in such places. See, we have to go through that small door near the purgatory into the choir. 
<P>What a blaze of light! There are scores of tapers on the altar, the crucifix, emblazoned banners, and the rich vestments of the officiating priests; and as they cross and recross the tessellated floor of the chancel, note that they make each time low   genuflexions towards the altar. Mark the incense-bearers, swinging the   spicy odours to and fro, which is wafted towards us, and mingles, as it were, with the loud pealing of the organ and the sweet chanting of the boy choristers, and the low responses of the cowled brethren of the priory. 
<P>Now they pass in procession round the church, along the choir, and down the lofty nave, towards the beautiful entrance-gate. Anon they return, and on reaching the altar-tomb of their founder, Rayer, they stop, a priest swings a censer to and fro before it, whilst all kneel and cross themselves; then again they move towards the altar, and as the choir ceases chanting, the last notes of the organ are heard reverberating along the lofty roof.   The brethren follow each other slowly towards the door, the tapers are extinguished <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, and thus the pageant fades from our imagination; and once more we find ourselves in Smithfield, outside the Cloth Fair gate of the ancient Priory of St. Bartholomew.</QUOTE>
 
<P>The dimensions of this most interesting church, half Norman, half early English, are generally given thus: The height about <num value="40">40</num> feet, the breadth <num value="60">60</num> feet, the length <num value="138">138</num> feet; add to this <num value="87">87</num> feet for the length of the destroyed nave, and we have <num value="225">225</num> feet as the entire length of the church of Rayer's priory.   The church was much injured in the fire of <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, when a portion of the middle roof of the south aisle fell. 
<P>When Rayer, on his return from doing penance at Rome, built a hospital in Smithfield, in performance of a vow made in sickness, he added to it that chapel which is now called <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.358.2">St. Bartholomewthe-Less</LEMMA>, which, after the dissolution, became a parish church for those living within the hospital precinct.   In Stow's time the church   seems to have been full of old monuments and brasses of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> and later centuries, a few of which only have been preserved. 
<P>Among those which no longer remain were <num value="2">two</num> brass effigies, <QUOTE>in the habit of pilgrims,</QUOTE> with an inscription, commencing-

<P>The length of the church, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, was <num value="99">99</num> feet, and the breadth was <num value="42">42</num> feet, except in the chancel, the narrowness of which latter, however, was more than counterbalanced by a chapel on the north side.</QUOTE>
 
<P>In <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>, Mr. George Dance, the architect and surveyor to the hospital, repaired the church, by <num value="1">first</num> destroying the whole interior, leaving only the old walls, the vestibule, and the square tower. Dry rot very soon setting in, in an aggravated form, Mr. Hardwick, in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, commenced the rebuilding, turning out Mr. Dance's timber octagon, and replacing it with stone and iron. It was then found that Mr. Dance, in his contempt for Gothic architecture, had ruthlessly cut away altar-tombs and such mediaeval trifles. The result of all this incompetent tinkering is a compo tower and an iron <pb id="P.359" n="359"> roof.   In the east window are several saints, the arms of Henry VIII. and the hospital, and those of various hospital treasurers.   North of the comnunion-table is a tablet in memory of the wife of Thomas Bodley, Elizabeth's ambassador in France and Germany, and the generous founder of the great library at Oxford. In this church there is also a monument to Henry Earle, surgeon, of St. Bartholomew's, which was erected to this amiable man in <datestruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>.   In the lobby that leads to the western porch, where a sexton hung himself in <datestruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>, there is a canopied altar-tomb and several relics of old Gothic sculpture. Among others, a niche containing the figure of an angel bearing a shield, and beneath it the arms of Edward the Confessor, impaled with those of England.

<P>The tower of St. Bartholomew-the-Less contains some fine Norman and early English arches and pillars.   The piscina   from   the ancient church is used as a font.   A beautiful chancel has been built, in the style of the Lady chapels in Normandy. The pulpit and reredos are marble and alabaster, with bas-relief of the Sermon on the Mount, and the stained glass windows are by Powell.   The parish register records the baptism of the celebrated Inigo Jones, son of a Welsh clothworker, residing at or near Cloth Fair; and the burial, in <datestruct value="1664--"><year reg="1664">1664</year></datestruct>, of James Heath, a Cavalier chronicler of the Civil Wars, who slandered Cromwell, and has been branded by Carlisle, in consequence, as <QUOTE>Carrion Heath.</QUOTE> He was buried near the screen door, says Aubrey.

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.359.3">St. Bartholomew's Hospital</LEMMA> was founded by Rayer, the jester or minstrel of Henry I. At the dissolution the fat, greedy hands of Henry VIII., that spared no gold that would melt, whether it was God's or man's, soon had a grip of it, but, for very shame, at the petition of Sir Richard Gresham, Lord Mayor and father of the builder of the Royal Exchange, he turned it over to the City. The king then, in <datestruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct>, says Mr. Timbs, <QUOTE>vested the Hospital of St. Bartholomew in the mayor, commonalty, and citizens of London, and their successors, for ever, in consideration of a payment by them of <measure value="500bmark" type=currency><num value="500">500</num> marks</measure> a year towards its maintenance, and with it the nomination and appointment of all the officers. In <datestruct VALUE="1557-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1557">1557</year></datestruct>, at a general court of the governors of all the hospitals, it was ordered that St. Bartholomew's should henceforth be united to the rest of the hospitals, and be made <num value="1">one</num> body with them, and on the following day ordinances were made by the corporation for the general government of all the hospitals. The <measure value="500bmark" type=currency><num value="500">500</num> marks</measure> a year have been paid by the corporation since <datestruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct>, besides the profit of many valuable leases.</QUOTE> 
<P>From a search made in the official records of the City, it appears that for more than <num value="300">300</num> yearsnamely, since <datestruct value="1549--"><year reg="1549">1549</year></datestruct>--an alderman of London had always been elected president of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Until <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>, whenever a vacancy occurred in the presidency of the royal hospitals (St. Bartholomew's, Bethlehem, Bridewell, St. Thomas's, or Christ's Hospitals), it was customary to elect the Lord Mayor for the time being, or an alderman who had passed the chair.   This rule was <num value="1">first</num> <pb id="P.360" n="360"> broken when the Duke of Cambridge was chosen president of Christ's Hospital, over the head of Alderman Sidney, the then Lord Mayor; and again, when Mr. Cubitt, then no longer an alderman, was elected president of St. Bartholomew's in preference to the then Lord Mayor. The question is, however, contested by the foundation-governors, or the corporation, and the donation-governors. 
<P>The <num value="1">first</num> superintendent of the hospital was Thomas Vicary, serjeant-surgeon to Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth, and <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest English writers on anatomy. The great Harvey, the physician of Charles I., and the <num value="1">first</num> discoverer of the circulation of the blood, was

 with the patient's wishes, but complimented him on the resolute manner he adopted. 
<P>Abernethy made but little distinction between a poor and a rich patient, but was rather more attentive to the former; and, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, gave great offence to a certain peer, by refusing to see him out of his turn.   On entering his apartment, the nobleman, having indignantly asked Abernethy if he knew who he was, stated his rank, name, &amp;c., when Abernethy, it is said, replied, with the most provoking <hi rend=italics>sang froid</hi>, <QUOTE>And I, sir, am John Abernethy, surgeon, lecturer of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, &c;; and if you wish to consult me, I am now ready to hear what you have to say in your turn.</QUOTE> The Duke of Wellington having insisted on seeing him out of his usual hours, and abruptly entering his parlour <num value="1">one</num> day, was asked by the doctor how he got into the room. <QUOTE>By the door,</QUOTE> was the reply. <QUOTE>Then,</QUOTE> said Abernethy, <QUOTE>I recommend you to make your exit by the same way.</QUOTE> He is said to have given another proof of his independence, by refusing to attend George IV. until he had delivered his lecture at the hospital; in consequence of which he lost a Royal appointment. <pb id="P.362" n="362"> 
<P>That eminent surgeon, Percival Pott, was also <num value="1">one</num> of the shining lights of St. Bartholomew's. The following is the story told of the celebrated fracture, which he afterwards learned to alleviate, and to which he gave his name:--In <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>, while on a visit to a patient in Kent Street, Southwark, he was thrown from his horse, and received a compound fracture of the leg. This event produced, perhaps, <num value="1">one</num> of the most extraordinary instances of coolness and prudence on record. Aware of the danger of rough and injudicious treatment, he would not suffer himself to be raised from the pavement, but sent a messenger for <num value="2">two</num> chairmen.   When they arrived, he directed them to nail their poles to a door, which he had purchased in the interim, on which he was then carefully placed, and borne to his residence in Watling Street, near St. Paul's. A consultation was immediately called, and amputation of the limb was resolved on; but, upon the suggestion of a humane friend, who soon after entered the room, a successful attempt to save the limb was made. This accident confined Mr. Pott to his house for several weeks, during which he conceived, and partly executed, his <QUOTE>Treatise on Ruptures.</QUOTE> 
<P>In <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct> the authorities founded a collegiate establishment for the resident pupils within the college walls: a spacious casualty room has also been added.   In <datestruct value="1736--"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct> the grand staircase was painted gratuitously by Hogarth, whose heart always warmed to works of charity.

<P>Dr. Anthony Askew, <num value="1">one</num> of the past celebrities of St. Bartholomew's, a contemporary of Freke, was scarcely more famous in medicine than in letters.   The friend of Dr. Mead, Hogarth, and other celebrities, he was a very notable personage in Georgian London, and, like Pitcairne and Freke, was a Fellow of the Royal Society. He employed Roubillac to produce the bust of Mead, which he presented to the College of Physicians, the price arranged being <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure>.

 paid the bill, even to the odd shillings, and sent the receipt to Hogarth.   Dr. Pate, a physician of St. Bartholomew's of the same period, lived in Hatton Garden, which, like Ely Place, was long a great place for doctors. Dr. Pitcairne, his colleague, lived in Warwick Court, till he moved into the treasurer's house, in St. Bartholomew's. He was buried in the hospital church. The posthumous sale of Dr. Askew's printed library, in <datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>, by Baker and Leigh, and which lasted <num value="20">twenty</num> days, was <hi rend=italics>the</hi> great literary auction of the time. There was a subsequent sale of the MSS. in <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>, which also produced a great sum. 
<P>Among the modern physicians of St. Bartholomew's we must notice Dr. Baly (Queen's physician, killed in a fearful railway accident) and   Dr. Jeaffreson, notable chiefly for his pleasant manners, his skill in whist, billiards, and shooting, and his extraordinary popularity. Wonderfully successful in practice, he was everybody's favourite; but, though a most enlightened   man, he did nothing for science, either through literature or investigation. 
<P>Among the modern surgeons to be noticed are Sir William Lawrence, Bart.; Mr. Skey, C.B., who was famous for recommending stimulants and denouncing boat-racing, and other too violent sports; and Thomas Wormald, who died lately.   Skey and Wormald were favourite pupils of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.363.4">Abernethy</LEMMA>, and imitators of their great master's jocular manner and pungent speech. Tommy Wormald, or <QUOTE>Old Tommy,</QUOTE> as the students called him, was Abernethy over again in voice, style, appearance, humour. <QUOTE>Done for,</QUOTE> was <num value="1">one</num> of his pithy written reports on a <QUOTE>bad life</QUOTE> to an insurance company, whose directors insisted that he should write his reports instead of giving them verbally. He once astounded an apothecary, who was about to put him and certain physicians off with a single guinea fee, at a consultation on a rich man's case, by saying, <QUOTE>A guinea is a lean fee, and the patient is a fat patient. I always have fat fees from   fat patients. Pay me <num value="2">two</num> guineas, sir, instantly. Pay Dr. Jeaffreson <num value="2">two</num> guineas, instantly, sir. Sir, pay both the physicians and me <num value="2">two</num> guineas each, instantly. Our patient is a fat patient.</QUOTE> Some years since, rich people of a mean sort would drive down to St. Bartholomew's, and get gratuitous advice, as out-patients. Tommy was determined to stop this abuse, and he did it by a series of outrageous assaults on the self-love of the offenders. Noticing a lady, dressed in silk, who had driven up to the hospital in a brougham, Tommy raised his rich, thunderous, sarcastic voice, and, to the inexpressible glee of a roomful of young students, addressed the lady thus:-- <QUOTE>Madam, this charity is for the poor, destitute, miserable invalids of London. So you are a miserable invalid in a silk dress --a destitute invalid, in a rich silk dress--a poor invalid, in a dress that a duchess might wear. Madam, I refuse to pay attention to miserable, destitute invalids, who wear rich silk dresses. You had better order your carriage, madam.</QUOTE> The lady did not come again. 
<P>A   few remaining spots round Smithfield still remain for us to notice, and foremost among these is Cloth Fair, the great resort in the Middle Ages of country clothiers and London drapers. Strype describes the street as even in his day chiefly inhabited by drapers and mercers; and Hatton mentions it as in the form of a T, the right arm running to Bartholomew Close, the left to Long Lane. 
<P>This latter lane, originally on the north side of the old priory, reaches from Smithfield to Aldersgate Street, and in Strype's time was known for its brokers, its <num value="2">second</num>-hand linen, its upholstery, and its pawnbrokers.   Congreve, always witty, makes Lady Wishfort, in his <title>Way of the World,</title>
 hope that <num value="1">one</num> of her admirers will <num value="1">one</num> day hang in tatters, like a Long Lane pent-house or a gibbeted thief; and good-natured Tom Brown declares that when the impudent rag-sellers in Barbican and Long Lane suddenly caught him by the arm and cried, <QUOTE>What do you lack?</QUOTE> he who feared the sight of a bailiff worse than the devil and all his works, was mortally scared. 
<P>In   Duck   Lane we part good friends with Smithfield. R. B., in Strype, describes it as coming out of Little Britain and falling into Smithfield, and much inhabited by <num value="2">second</num>-hand booksellers. Howell, in his <title>Letters,</title> mentions finding the Poet-Laureate Skelton, <QUOTE>pitifully tattered and torn,</QUOTE> skulking in Duck Lane; and Garth, in his pleasant and graphic poem, says- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Here dregs and sediment of auctions reign, 
<L>Refuse of fairs, and gleanings of Duck Lane.</QUOTE>
 And Swift, in <num value="1">one</num> of the best of his short poems (that on his own death), writes- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Some country squire to Lintot goes, 
<L>Inquires for Swift, in verse and prose.

<P>At the Giltspur Street end of the market stands Pie Corner, worthy of note as the spot where the Great Fire, which began in Pudding Lane, reached its limits: the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.363.5">figure of a fat boy</LEMMA> still marks the spot.

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 
<P>Lives there a Londoner who has not, at some stray hour or other, leant against the tall iron gates in Newgate Street, and felt his golden youth return, as he watched the gambols of the little bareheaded men in blue petticoats and yellow stockings? Can any man of thought, however hurried Citywards, but stop a moment to watch and see the <QUOTE>scrouge,</QUOTE> the mad rush after the football, the dashing race to rescue prisoners at the bases? Summer or winter, the yellow-legged boys form a pleasant picture of perpetual youth; nor can <num value="1">one</num> ever pass a strapping young Grecian in the streets without feeling some veneration for the successor of Coleridge and Charles Lamb, Hazlitt and Leigh Hunt. 
<P>Where the fine old school now stands was the site of a convent of Grey (or Mendicant) Friars, who, coming to London in the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century, after a short stay in Holborn and Cornhill, were, in <datestruct value="1225--"><year reg="1225">1225</year></datestruct>, housed on the north side of Newgate Street, on a good plot of ground next St. Nicholas Shambles, by John Ewin, a pious and generous mercer, who eventually became a lay brother. The friars of St. Francis, aided by men like Ewin, throve well on the scraps of Holborn and Cheapside, and their chapel soon grew into a small church, which was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1327--"><year reg="1327">1327</year></datestruct> with great splendour.   The Grey Friars' church, says Pennant, was reckoned <QUOTE><num value="1">one</num> of the most superb of the conventual establishments of London,</QUOTE> and alms poured fast into its treasury. It received royal offerings and sheltered royal dead. In <datestruct value="1429--"><year reg="1429">1429</year></datestruct> the immortal Whittington built the studious friars of Newgate Street <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.364.2">a library,   <num value="129">129</num> feet long</LEMMA> and <num value="31">31</num> broad, with <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> desks, and <num value="8">eight</num> double settles. In <num value="3">three</num> years it was filled with books, costing <measure value="556l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="556">556</num></measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure>, whereof Richard Whittington gave <measure value="400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400">400</num></measure>, and Dr. Thomas Winchilsey, <num value="1">one</num> of the friars, the rest, adding an especial <measure value="100bmark" type=currency><num value="100">100</num> marks</measure> for the writing out the works of D. Nicholas de Lira, in <num value="2">two</num> volumes, to be chained there. Among the royal contributors to the Grey Friars we may mention Queen Margaret, <num value="2">second</num> wife of Edward I., who gave in her lifetime <measure value="2000bmark" type=currency><num value="2000">2,000</num> marks</measure>, and by will <measure value="100bmark" type=currency><num value="100">100</num> marks</measure>, towards building a choir; John Britain, Earl of Richmond, gave <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure> towards the church building, besides jewels and ornaments; Mary, Countess of Pembroke, sent <measure value="70l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="70">70</num></measure>, and Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, <num value="20">twenty</num> great oak beams from his forest at Tunbridge and <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>; the good Queen Philippa, wife of Edward III., <measure value="62l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="62">62</num></measure>; and Isabel, queen-mother of Edward III., <measure value="70l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="70">70</num></measure>. 
<P>The founder of the school is by most people supposed to have been <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.364.3">Edward VI.</LEMMA>, but it was really his father, Henry VIII., and it was <num value="1">one</num> of the few works of mercy which originated in that cruel tyrant. At the dissolution, when sacramental cups and crucifixes were being melted down by the <num value="1000">thousand</num>, to maintain a bad king in his sumptuous splendour, the English Sultan, in <num value="1">one</num> of his few good moments, near the end of his reign, gave the Grey Friars' church to the City, to be devoted to the relief of the poor. The building had previously been used as a storehouse for plunder taken from the French.   The gift, confirmed by the pious young king, Edward VI., was announced by Dr. Ridley, Bishop of Rochester, at a public sermon at Paul's Cross. The parishes of St. Ewin, St. Nicholas, and, part of St. Sepulchre's were at this time compressed into <num value="1">one</num> large parish, and called Christ Church. 
<P>The good work remained in abeyance, till, in <num value="3552">3552</num>, the worthy Ridley, preaching before the young king, his subject being <QUOTE>mercy and charity,</QUOTE> made, says Stow, <QUOTE>a fruitful and godly exhortation</QUOTE> to the rich to be merciful to the poor, and also to move those who were in authority to strive, by charitable ways and means, to comfort and relieve them. The young king, always eager to do good, hearing that London swarmed with impoverished and neglected people, at once sent for the bishop to come to him after sermon. The memorable interview between Ridley and Edward took place in a great gallery at Westminster, where the king and bishop were alone. A chair had been already provided for the bishop, and the king insisted on the worthy prelate remaining covered. Edward <num value="1">first</num> gave the bishop hearty thanks for his good sermon and exhortation, and mentioned the special points which he had noted. <QUOTE> <Q>Truely, truely,</Q>  remarks Ridley (for that commonly was his oath),  <Q> I could never have thought that excellency to have been in his Grace, but that I beheld and heard it in him.</Q>  At the last the king's majestie much <pb id="P.365" n="365"> commended him for his exhortation for the reliefe of the poore.  <Q>For, my lord,</Q>  quoth he,  <Q>you willed such as are in authority to bee careful thereof, and to devise some good order for theire reliefe, wherein I think you mean mee; for I am in highest place, and therefore am the <num value="1">first</num> that must make answer unto God for my negligence, if I should not be careful therein, knowing it to bee the expresse commandment of Almighty God to have compassion of his poore and needy members, for whom we must make an account unto him. And truely, my lord, I am   (before all things else) most willing to travaile that way, and doubting nothing of your long and approved wisdome and learning, who have such good zeale as wisheth health unto them; but also that you have had some conference with others what waies are best to be taken therein, the which I am desirous to understand; I pray you therefore to say your minde.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P>The bishop, amazed to hear the wisdom and earnest zeal of the child-king, confessed that he was so astonished that he hardly knew what to reply; but after a pause, he urged the special claims of the poor of London, where the citizens were wise, and, he doubted not, pitiful and merciful, and would carry out the work. The king, not releasing Ridley till his letter to the mayor was written, signed, and sealed, sent his express commandment to the- mayor that he should inform him how far he had proceeded.   Ridley, overjoyed at such youthful zeal, went that night to Sir Richard Dobbes, the Lord Mayor, and delivered the king's letter and message. The mayor, honoured and pleased, invited the bishop to dine the next day with <num value="2">two</num> aldermen and <num value="6">six</num> commoners, to discuss the charitable enterprise.   On the mayor's report to the king, Edward expressed his willingness to grant a charter to the new governors, and to be proclaimed as founder and patron of the new hospital. He also confirmed his father's grant of the old Grey Friars' monastery, and endowed it (to bring the charity at once into working order) with lands and tenements that had belonged to the Savoy, of the yearly value of about <measure value="450l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="450">450</num></measure>.

Edward filled up the blank with the words <QUOTE><measure value="4000bmark" type=currency><num value="4000">4,000</num> marks</measure>,</QUOTE> and then, before his whole council, exclaimed, with his usual pious fervour, <QUOTE>Lord, I yield Thee most hearty thanks that Thou hast given me life thus long, to finish this work to the glory of Thy name.</QUOTE> 
<P>Edward, says the Rev. W. Trollope, the historian of Christ's Hospital, lived about a month after signing the Charter of Incorporation of the Royal Hospitals.   The citizens, roused by the king's fervour, and touched by his untimely death, set to work with gold and steel, and in <num value="6">six</num> months the old Grey Friars' monastery was patched up sufficiently to accommodate <datestruct value="340"><year reg="340">340</year></datestruct> boys, a number increased to <num value="380">380</num> by the end of the year. 
<P>As the Grey Friars' churchyard was thought, in the Middle Ages, to be peculiarly free from incubi and flying demons of all sorts, it soon became a fashionable burying-place, and almost as popular as the great abbey even with royalty. <num value="4">Four</num> queens lie there, among countless lords and ladies, brave knights, and godly monks-Margaret, <num value="2">second</num> wife of Edward I., and Isabella, the infamous wife and part murderess of Edward II., both, as we have before mentioned, benefactors to the hospital; Joan, daughter of Edward II. and wife of David Bruce, King of Scotland; and, lastly, Isabella, wife of William, Baron Fitzwarren, titular Queen of Man. The English Queen Isabella, as if to propagate an eternal lie, was buried with the heart of her murdered husband on her breast. Her ghost, according to all true <QUOTE>Blues,</QUOTE> still haunts the cloisters. 
<P>Here, also, rest other knights and ladies, almost equally illustrious by birth; among others, Isabella, daughter of Edward III. and wife of Ingelram de Courcy, Earl of Bedford; John Hastings, the young Earl of Pembroke, slain by accident at a Christmas tournament in Woodstock Park, <datestruct value="1389--"><year reg="1389">1389</year></datestruct>; John, Duke of Bourbon, <num value="1">one</num> of the noble French prisoners taken at Agincourt, who had been a prisoner in the Tower eighteen years; Walter Blunt, Lord Mountjoy, Lord Treasurer to Edward IV., and the <QUOTE>gentle Mortimer,</QUOTE> the wretched paramour of Queen Isabella, who was hung at Tyburn, and left <num value="2">two</num> days withering on the gallows.   Lastly, those <num value="2">two</num> rapacious favourites of Richard II., Sir Robert Tresilian, Chief Justice of England, and Sir Nicholas Brembre, Lord Mayor of London, both hung at Tyburn. Tradition goes that they could not hang Tresilian till they had removed from his person certain magic images and the head of a devil. 
<P>The friars' churchyard seems also to have been fashionable with state criminals of the Middle Ages, for here also lies Sir John Mortimer, an unhappy Yorkist, hung, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn by the Lancastrian party in <datestruct value="1423--"><year reg="1423">1423</year></datestruct> (the <num value="2">second</num> year of the reign of the child-king, Henry VI.) To the same bourne also came a victim of Yorkist cruelty, Thomas Burdet, for speaking a few angry words about a favourite white buck which Edward IV. had carelessly killed. A murderess, too, lies here, a lady named Alice Hungerford, who, <pb id="P.366" n="366">

In <datestruct value="1673--"><year reg="1673">1673</year></datestruct>, Charles II., at the suggestion of our old friend Pepys, Sir Robert Clayton, and Lord Treasurer Clifford, founded a mathematical school for the instruction of <num value="40">forty</num> boys in navigation, and appointed Pepys <num value="1">one</num> of the governors.   King Charles endowed the school with <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> for <num value="7">seven</num> years, and added an annuity of <measure value="370l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="370">370</num></measure> out of the Exchequer, for the educating and sending to sea <num value="10">ten</num> boys annually, <num value="5">five</num> of whom pass an examination before the Elder Trinity Brothers every <num value="6">six</num> months.

 for <num value="3">three</num> playgrounds--the ditch, the garden, and the new playground. The site of the grammarschool was taken from the south side of the ditch. The following used to be a sufficiently accurate account of the school premises:--On the south side of the entrance from   Little Britain is the treasurer's house, and the other houses in this playground are occupied by the matron, masters, and beadles. Proceeding in an easterly direction leads to the south-east entrance from Butcher Hall Lane, Newgate Street, and in this space (which is called the counting-house yard) stands the counting-house, and several other houses, which are inhabited by the clerks and some of the masters. The treasurer has also a back entrance to his house, at the end of the counting-house, and his garden runs at the back of all the houses on the east side of this yard. The opposite building is occupied by the boys, and in a niche in the centre, fronting the door of the counting-house, is <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.368.3">a statue of King Edward</LEMMA> (considered the most perfect <num value="1">one</num>), which represents his majesty, who stands on a black marble slab, in the act of delivering the charter. 
<P>The mathematical school is over the old west entrance, now closed up, and was built by Wren, with a ward for the foundation boys over it. <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.368.4">A robed statue of Charles II. dated <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>, stands over the gateway</LEMMA>.      The entrance leads to the northwest corner of the cloisters, which form the <num value="4">four</num> shady sides of the garden playground, and have porticoes, with Gothic arches all round. The walls are supported by abutments of the old priory. Wren repaired the cloisters, which are useful to the young blue monks for play and promenade in wet weather. 
<P>The great dining-hall is every way worthy of the grand old City school.   It was erected   from designs of John Shaw, architect, and stands partly on the foundations of the ancient refectory, and partly on the site of the old City wall. The style is pure Gothic, and the southern or principal front is built of Portland stone with cloisters of Heytor granite, running beneath a portion of the dininghall. <num value="9">Nine</num> large and handsome windows occupy the entire front. On the ground storey are the governors' room, the wardrobe, the buttery, and other offices; and the basement storey contains, besides cellars, &amp;c., a spacious kitchen, <num value="69">69</num> feet long by <num value="33">33</num> feet wide, supported by massive granite pillars. The hall itself, with its lobby and organgallery, occupies the entire upper storey, which is <num value="187">187</num> feet long, <num value="51.50">51 1/2</num> feet wide, and <num value="46.50">46 1/2</num> feet high. It was at <num value="1">one</num> time (and perhaps still is) famous for its rats, who, attracted by the crumbs and fragments of food, foraged about after dark in hundreds. It used to be the peculiar pride of an old <QUOTE>Blue</QUOTE> to catch these rats with his hands only, traps being considered cowardly aids to humanity and unworthy of the hospital. The old dusty pictureframes are favourite terraces for these vermin. 
<P>The <num value="2">two</num> famous pictures in the hall-neither of them   of much real merit, but valuable for their portraits--are those of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.368.5">Edward VI. renewing his father's gift of the hospital</LEMMA>, and of St. Thomas and Bridewell, to the City, falsely ascribed to Holbein, who died <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> years before it took place; and <QUOTE>sprawling</QUOTE> Verrio's picture of James II. receiving an audience of Christ's Hospital boys and girls. The pseudo-Holbein and the painting by Verrio are both well described by Malcolm. The so-called Holbein <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>adorns the west wall, and is placed near the entrance, at the north end of the hall. The king is seated on a throne, elevated on <num value="2">two</num> steps, with <num value="2">two</num> very clumsy brackets for arms, on which are fanciful pilasters, adorned with carving, and an arch; on the left pilaster, a crowned lion holding a shield, with the letter  <Q>E</Q> ; a dragon on the other has another inscribed  <Q>R.</Q>  <num value="2">Two</num> angels, reclining on the arch, support the arms of England. The hall of audience is represented as paved with black and white marble; the windows are angular, with niches between each. As there are statues in only <num value="2">two</num> of those, it seems to confirm the idea that it is an exact resemblance of the royal apartment. 
<P>The artist has bestowed his whole attention on the young monarch, whose attitude is easy, natural, and dignified. He presents the deed of gift with his right hand, and holds the sceptre in his left. The scarlet robe is embroidered, and lined with ermine, and the folds are correctly and minutely finished. An unavoidable circumstance injures the effect of this picture, which is the diminutive stature of the infant-king, who shrinks into a dwarf, compared with his full-grown courtiers; unfortunately, reversing the necessary rule of giving most dignity and consequence to the principal person in the piece. 
<P>The chancellor holds the seals over his crossed arms at the king's right hand. This officer and <num value="3">three</num> others are the only standing figures. Ridley kneels at the foot of the throne, and shows his face in profile with uplifted hands. On the right are the mayor and aldermen, in scarlet robes, kneeling. Much cannot be said in praise of those worthies. The members of the Common Council, &amp;c., on the other side, are grouped with more skill, and the action is more varied. The heads of the spectators are generally full of anxious attention. 
<P>But <num value="5">five</num> of <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> children who are introduced in the foreground turn towards the king; the <pb id="P.369" n="369"> remainder look out of the picture. The matron on the girls' side (if a portrait) was chosen for her mental and not her personal qualifications. Such are the merits and defects of this celebrated painting, which, though infinitely inferior to many of Holbein's Dutch and Italian contemporaries, is a valuable, and in many respects an excellent, historic composition. 
<P>Verrio's enormous picture</QUOTE> of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.369.1">James II.</LEMMA> and the Bluecoat children <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>must originally have been in <num value="3">three</num> parts: the centre on the end wall, and the <num value="2">two</num> others on the adjoining sides. Placed thus, the perspective of the depths of the arches would have been right; as it is at present, extended on <num value="1">one</num> plane, they are exactly the reverse.   The audience-chamber is of the Ionic order, with <num value="20">twenty</num> pilasters, and their entablatures and arches. The passage, seen through those, has an intersected arched ceiling. The king sits in the centre of the painting, on a throne of crimson damask, with the royal arms embroidered on the drapery of the canopy, the front of which is of fringed white cloth of gold. The footstool is of purple cloth of gold, and the steps of the throne are covered by a rich Turkey carpet, not remarkably well painted. The king holds a scroll in his left hand, extends the right, and seems to address a person immediately before him.   The position of his body and the fore-shortened arm are excellent, and the lace and drapery are finely drawn and coloured.   On the sides of the throne are <num value="2">two</num> circular portraits. 
<P>The painter has committed a strange error in turning the king's face from the Lord Mayor, who points in vain to an extended map, a globe, and all the kneeling figures, exulting in the progress of their <num value="40">forty</num> boys in the mathematics, who are busily employed in producing their cases and definitions. Neither in such an attitude could the king observe <num value="14">fourteen</num> kneeling girls, though their faces and persons are handsome and graceful, and the matron and her assistant seem eager to place them in the monarch's view. Verrio has stationed himself at the extreme end of the picture, and his expression appears to inquire the spectators' opinion of his performance.   On the opposite side a yeoman of the guard clears the way for some person, and a female seems alarmed at his violence, but a fulldressed youth before him looks out of the picture with the utmost indifference.   There is <num value="1">one</num> excellent head which speaks earnestly to a boy. Another figure, probably the master or steward, pulls a youth's hair with marks of anger. Several lords-in-waiting are correct and good figures. 
<P>At the upper end of the room, and on the same west wall, is a large whole-length of Charles II. descending from his throne, a curtain from which is turned round a pillar. The king holds his robe with his right hand, and points with the left to a globe and mathematical instruments. 
<P>Some years past</QUOTE> --the date of Malcolm's writing is <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>- <QUOTE>an addition was made to the hall, by taking part of the ward over the south cloister into   it.   In this are several portraits. Queen Anne, sitting, habited in a gown of cloth of gold with a blue mantle laced with gold and lined with ermine. Her black hair is curled, and without ornament; the arms are too small, but the neck and drapery are good. She holds the orb in her left hand, rested on the knee; the right crosses her waist.</QUOTE>
 
<P> <QUOTE>Although Christ's Hospital is, and has been from its foundation, in the main a commercial seminary,</QUOTE> says Mr. Howard Staunton, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>the list of 
<Q>Blues</Q> who have acquired celebrity in what are called the <Q>liberal professions</Q> would confer honour upon a school of much loftier pretensions. Notably among the earliest scholars are the memorable Jesuit, Edmund Campion, a man whose unquestionable piety and marvellous ability might well have saved him from a horrible and shameful death; the great antiquary, William Camden, though the fact of his admission is not satisfactorily authenticated; Bishop Stillingfleet (according to the testimony of Pepys); David Baker, the ecclesiastical historian; John Vicars, a religious controversialist of considerable learning and indefatigable energy, but whose fanaticism and intolerance have obtained him an unenviable notoriety from the pen of the author of  <Q>Hudibras;</Q>  Joshua Barnes, the Greek scholar; John Jurin, another scholar of great eminence, and who was elected President of the College of Physicians; Jeremiah   Markland, a man of distinction, both as scholar and critic; Richardson, the celebrated novelist; Bishop Middleton, of Calcutta; Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Robert Allen. 
<P>In the present century Christ's Hospital can boast of Thomas Mitchell, the well-known translator of Aristophanes; William   Henry Neale, Master of Beverley School; <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.369.2">Leigh Hunt</LEMMA>, Charles Lamb, George Dyer, James White, James Scholefield, Regius Professor of Greek in Cambridge; the Rev. George Townsend; and Thomas Barnes, a late editor of the <title>Times</title>,  <Q>than whom,</Q>  Leigh Hunt tells us,  <Q>no man, if he had cared for it, could have been more certain of distinction.</Q> </QUOTE>
 
<P> <QUOTE>In the cloisters,</QUOTE> says Leigh Hunt, <QUOTE>a number of persons lie buried, besides the officers of the house. Among them is Isabella, wife of Edward II., the  <Q>she-wolf of France.</Q>  I was not aware of this <pb id="P.370" n="370"> circumstance then; but many a time, with a recollection of some lines in Blair's  <Q> Grave</Q>  upon me, have I run as hard as I could, at night-time, from my ward to another, in order to borrow the next volume of some ghostly romance. In <num value="1">one</num> of the cloisters was an impression resembling a gigantic foot, which was attributed by some to the angry stamping of the ghost of a beadle's wife!</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>Our dress,</QUOTE> says the same pleasant author, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>was of the coarsest and quaintest kind, but was respected out of doors, and is so. It consisted of a blue drugget gown, or body, with ample skirts to it; a yellow vest underneath, in winter-time; smallclothes of Russia duck; worsted yellow stockings; a leathern girdle; and a little black worsted cap, usually carried in the hand. I believe it was the ordinary dress of children in humble life, during the reign of the Tudors. We used to flatter ourselves that it was taken from the monks; and there went a monstrous tradition that at <num value="1">one</num> period it consisted of blue velvet with silver buttons.   It was said, also, that during the blissful era of the blue velvet we had roast mutton for supper, but that the smallclothes not being then in existence, and the mutton suppers too luxurious, the eatables were given up for the ineffables. <gap>
 
<P>Our routine of life was this: We rose to the call of a bell at <num value="6">six</num> in summer and <num value="7">seven</num> in winter; and after combing ourselves and washing our hands and faces, went at the call of another bell to breakfast. All this took up about an hour. From breakfast we proceeded to school, where we remained till <datestruct value="11"><year reg="11">eleven</year></datestruct>, winter and summer, and then had an hour's play. Dinner took place at <num value="12">twelve</num>. Afterwards was a little play till <num value="1">one</num>, when we again went to school, and remained till <num value="5">five</num> in summer and <num value="4">four</num> in winter. At <num value="6">six</num> was the supper. We used to play after it in summer till <num value="8">eight</num>: in winter we proceeded from supper to bed. On Sundays, the school-time of the other days was occupied in church, both morning and evening; and as the Bible was read to us every day before every meal and on going to bed, besides prayers and graces, we rivalled the monks in the religious part of our duties . 
<P>When I entered the school,</QUOTE> says Leigh Hunt, speaking of the Grecians, <QUOTE>I was shown <num value="3">three</num> gigantic boys-young men, rather (for the eldest was between <num value="17">seventeen</num> and eighteen)-who, I was told, were going to the university.   These were the Grecians.   They were the <num value="3">three</num> head boys of the grammar-school, and were understood to have their destiny fixed for the Church. The next class to these-like a college of cardinals to those <num value="3">three</num> popes (for every Grecian was in our eyes infallible)-were the deputy-Grecians.   The former were supposed to have completed their Greek studies, and were deep in Sophocles and Euripides. The latter were thought equally competent to tell you anything respecting Homer and Demosthenes.</QUOTE>
 
<P>The <QUOTE>fazzer,</QUOTE> in Leigh Hunt's time, was the mumbo-jumbo of the hospital. <QUOTE>The fazzer,</QUOTE> says author, <QUOTE>was known to be nothing more than <num value="1">one</num> of the boys themselves. In fact, he consisted of <num value="1">one</num> of the most impudent of the bigger ones; but as it was his custom to disguise his face, and as this aggravated the terror which made the little boys hide their own faces, his participation of our common human nature only increased the supernatural fearfulness of his pretensions.   His office as fazzer consisted in being audacious, unknown and frightening the boys at night, sometimes by pulling them out of their beds, sometimes by simply <hi rend=italics>fazzing</hi> their hair ( <Q> fazzing</Q>  meant pulling or vexing, like a goblin); sometimes (which was horriblest of all) by quietly giving us to understand, in some way or other, that the  <Q>fazzer was out,</Q>  that is to say, out of his own bed, and then being seen (by those who dared to look) sitting, or otherwise making his appearance, in his white shirt, motionless and dumb.</QUOTE> 
<P>Charles Lamb talks of the earlier school in a different vein, and with more poetry and depth of feeling. <QUOTE>I must,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>crave leave to remember our transcending superiority in those invigorating sports, leapfrog and basting the bear; our delightful excursions in the summer holidays to the New River, near Newington, where, like otters, we would live the long day in the water, never caring for dressing ourselves when we had once stripped; our savoury meals afterwards, when we came home almost famished with staying out all day without our dinners; our visits, at other times, to the Tower, where, by ancient privilege, we had free access to all the curiosities; our solemn processions through the City at Easter, with the Lord Mayor's largess of buns, wine, and a shilling, with the festive questions and civic pleasantries of the dispensing aldermen, which were more to us than all the rest of the banquet; our stately suppings in public, when the well-lighted hall, and the confluence of well-dressed company who came to see us, made the whole look more like a concert or assembly than a scene of a plain bread and cheese collation; the annual orations upon St. Matthew's Day, in which the senior scholar, before he had done, seldom failed to reckon up among those who had done honour to our school, by being educated in it, the names of those accomplished critics and <pb id="P.371" n="371"> Greek scholars, Joshua Barnes and Jeremiah Markland (I marvel they left out Camden, while they were about it). Let me have leave to remember our hymns and anthems, and well-toned organ; the doleful tune of the burial anthem, chanted in the solemn cloisters upon the seldom-occurring funeral of some schoolfellow; the festivities at Christmas, when the richest of us would club our stock to have a gaudy-day, sitting round the fire, replenished to the height with logs, and the penniless and he that could contribute nothing partook in all the mirth and some of the substantialities of the feasting; the carol sung by night at that time of the year, which, when a young boy, I have so often lain awake to hear, from <num value="7">seven</num> (the hour of going to bed) till <datestruct value="10"><year reg="10">ten</year></datestruct>, when it was sung by the older boys and monitors, and have listened to it in their rude chanting, till I have been transported in fancy to the fields of Bethlehem, and the song which was sung at that season by angels' voices to the shepherds. 
<P>Nor would I willingly forget any of those things which administered to our vanity. The hem-stitched bands and town-made shirts, which some of the most fashionable among us wore; the town girdles, with buckles of silver or shining stone; the badges of the sea-boys; the cots, or superior shoe-strings, of the monitors; the medals of the markers (those who were appointed to hear the Bible read in the wards on Sunday morning and evening), which bore on their obverse, in silver, as certain parts of our garments carried, in meaner metal, the countenance of our founder, that godly and royal child, King Edward the <num value="6">Sixth</num>, the flower of the Tudor name--the young flower that was untimely cropt, as it began to fill our land with its early odours--the boy-patron of boys-the serious and holy child, who walked with Cranmer and Ridley, fit associate, in those tender years, for the bishops and future martyrs of our Church, to receive or (as occasion sometimes proved) to give instruction:--

<P>Of the hospital good Lamb says :--  I remember L--at school, and can well recollect that he had some peculiar advantages which I and others of his schoolfellows had not. His friends lived in town, and were near at hand; and he had the privilege of going to see them, almost as often as he wished, through some invidious distinction, which was denied to us. The present worthy subtreasurer to the Inner Temple can explain how that happened. He had his tea and hot rolls in a morning, while we were battening upon our quarter of a penny loaf- our  <QUOTE>crug</QUOTE> --moistened with attenuated small beer, in wooden piggins, smacking of the pitched leathern jack it was poured from. Our Monday's milk porridge, blue and tasteless, and the pease-soup of Saturday, coarse and choking, were enriched for him with a slice of  <QUOTE> extraordinary bread and butter</QUOTE>  from the hot loaf of the Temple. The Wednesday's mess of millet, somewhat less repugnant-(we had <num value="3">three</num> banyan to <num value="4">four</num> meat days in the week)-was endeared to his palate by a lump of double-refined, and a smack of ginger (to make it go down the more glibly), or the fragrant cinnamon. In lieu of our <hi rend=italics>half-pickled</hi>
 Sundays, or <hi rend=italics>quite fresh</hi> boiled beef on Thursdays (strong as <foreign lang=la>caro equina</foreign>), with detestable marigolds floating in the pail, to poison the broth-our scanty mutton scrags on Fridays, and rather more savoury but grudging portions of the same flesh, rotten roasted or rare, on the Tuesdays (the only dish which excited our appetites and disappointed our stomachs in almost equal proportion)-he had his hot plate of roast veal, or the more tempting griskin (exotics unknown to our palates), cooked in the paternal kitchen (a great thing), and brought him daily by his maid or aunt! I remember the good old relative (in whom love forbade pride), squatted down upon some odd stone in a by-nook of the cloisters, disclosing the viands (of higher regale than those cates which the ravens ministered to the Tishbite), and the contending passions of L----   at the unfolding. There was love for the bringer; shame for the thing brought and the manner of its bringing; sympathy for those who were too many to share in it, and, at top of all, hunger (eldest, strongest of the passions!) predominant, breaking down the strong fences of shame, and awkwardness, and a troubling overconsciousness.<gap>

This was the punishment for the <num value="1">first</num> offence. As a novice, I was soon after taken to see the dungeons. These were little square Bedlam cells, where a boy could just lie at his length upon straw and a blanket--a mattress, I think, was afterwards substituted--with a peep of light, let in askance, from a prison orifice at top, barely enough to read by. Here the poor boy was locked in by himself all day, without sight of any but the porter, who brought him his bread and water, who might not speak to him, or of the beadle, who came twice a week to call him out to receive his periodical chastisement.</QUOTE>

In this disguisement he was brought into the hall (L---&lsquo;s favourite stateroom), where awaited him the whole number of his schoolfellows, whose joint lessons and sports he was henceforth to share no more; the awful presence of the steward, to be seen for the last time; of the executioner-beadle, clad in his state robe for the occasion; and of <num value="2">two</num> faces more, of direr import, because never but in these extremities visible.

His eye was close and cruel. The spectacles which he wore threw a balm over it. Being a clergyman, he dressed in black, with a powdered wig.   His clothes were cut short; his

In fact, his weak side, and undoubtedly his natural destination, lay in carpentry, and he accordingly carried, in a side-pocket made on purpose, a carpenter's rule. 
<P>Jeremy Boyer had <num value="2">two</num> wigs, both pedantic, but of different omen--the <num value="1">one</num>, serene, smiling, fresh-powdered, betokening a mild day; the other, an old, discoloured, unkempt, angry caxon, denoting frequent and bloody execution.

How have I seen the   casual passer through the cloisters stand still, entranced with admiration (while he weighed the disproportion between the <hi rend=italics>speech</hi> and the <hi rend=italics>garb</hi> of the young Mirandula), to hear thee unfold, in thy deep and sweet intonations, the mysteries of Jamblichus or Plotinus (for even in those years thou waxedest not pale at such philosophic draughts), or reciting Homer in his Greek, or Pindar, while the walls of the old Grey Friars re-echoed to the accents of the inspired charity-boy!

<P> <QUOTE>The upper grammar-school was divided into <num value="4">four</num> classes, or forms. The <num value="2">two</num> under ones were called Little and Great Erasmus; the <num value="2">two</num> upper were occupied by the Grecians and Deputy-Grecians. We used to think the title of Erasmus taken from the great scholar of that name; but the sudden appearance of a portrait among us, claiming to be the likeness of a certain Erasmus Smith, Esq., shook us terribly in this opinion, and was a hard trial of our gratitude.   We scarcely relished this perpetual company of our benefactor, watching us, as he seemed to do, with his omnipresent eyes. I believe he was a rich merchant, and that the forms of Little and Great Erasmus were really named after him. It was a poor consolation to think that he himself, or his great uncle, might have been named after Erasmus.   Little Erasmus learned Ovid; Great Erasmus, Virgil, Terence, and the Greek Testament. The Deputy-Grecians were in Homer, Cicero, and Demosthenes; the Grecians in the Greek plays and the mathematics.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>I have spoken,</QUOTE> says Leigh Hunt, speaking of Charles Lamb, <QUOTE>of the distinguished individuals bred at Christ's Hospital, including Coleridge and Lamb, who left the school not long before I entered it.   Coleridge I never saw till he was old. Lamb I recollect coming to see the boys, with a pensive, brown, handsome, and kindly face, and a gait advancing with a motion from side to side, between involuntary consciousness and attempted ease. His brown complexion may have been owing to a visit in the country; his air of uneasiness, to a great burden of sorrow.   He dressed with a quaker-like plainness. I did not know him as Lamb; I took him for a Mr.  <Q>Guy,</Q>  having heard somebody address him by that appellative, I suppose in jest.</QUOTE> 
<P>Soon after the foundation of the schools, says the latest writer on the subject,   we find lands and legacies pouring in for the benefit of the charity; many, however, of the gifts being for the blind and aged, for exhibitions, for apprenticing, and for many other objects not strictly attached to the hospital, considered merely as a school. In the same manner many persons left estates and moneys to the governors, on condition that a certain number of scholars should be taken from   the ranks of certain City companies, or from certain particular parishes, or should be nominated by some public body, fixed by the donor. From these causes the <pb id="P.375" n="375"> present property of the trust is encumbered with many charges for purposes which, in the present day, are unnecessary, and often impracticable. Thus, <num value="1">one</num> person left a legacy on condition that a certain number of boys should receive pairs of gloves, on which should be printed, <QUOTE>Christ is risen,</QUOTE> and these were to be worn in the various processions in which the school took part in Easter week. The gloves are still given, but instead of being printed on the glove, a little badge is worn, with the words required by the founder. A certain Mary Hunt gave <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>, that <measure value="3l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3">3</num></measure> yearly should be expended for a dinner of boiled legs of pork, while several other persons left moneys to be expended on roast beef and mutton, <num value="1">one</num> of them expressly stating that his gift was to be in addition to the ordinary meat provided for the scholars. If Charles Lamb is to be believed-and he himself was a <QUOTE>Blue</QUOTE> --the gifts of extra meat were, at that date, very much needed; and we are also told that in addition to the quantity being small, the quality also was then far from good. No such complaints can be made in the present day. Many of the contributions given for the hospital were very large, that of Lady Mary Ramsey, wife of a Lord Mayor of London, being now worth over <measure value="4000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4000">4,000</num></measure> a year; and within the last <num value="10">ten</num> years Mr. Richard Thornton bequeathed a large sum to the charity.   <num value="1">One</num> cannot, therefore, be astonished to find, particularly when we remember that the school is especially connected with the Corporation of London, that the present gross income of Christ's Hospital is now about <measure value="70000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="70000">70,000</num></measure> per annum, of which about <measure value="42000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="42000">42,000</num></measure> is expended on education. 
<P>The Schools' Inquiry Commissioners hesitate to disturb the old dress, which Charles Lamb has declared it would be a kind of sacrilege to change; it is, however, very distasteful to the <QUOTE>Grecians,</QUOTE> or senior boys. 
<P>The number of boys in the school at present is, as a rule, about <num value="1200">1,200</num>, of whom somewhat less than <num value="800">800</num> are at the premises in Newgate Street; the remainder--the younger boys-being kept at Hertford for from <num value="1">one</num> to <num value="3">three</num> years before being sent to the London institution. As a general rule the boys are supposed to leave at <num value="15">fifteen</num> years of age, the Grecians and Deputy-Grecians, with a few of the King's scholars, who require a further time for their studies, remaining longer in the school. The age of admission is <num value="7">seven</num>, the boys, as is well known, being nominated by the various members of the governing body. In addition to the fixed body of governors there are a large number of presentation governors, who have each paid <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> to the funds of the charity.   This payment, indeed, is not supposed necessarily to cause the donor to be elected a governor, but as the privilege has rarely been withheld; it is practically the fact that such a gift will, in all reasonable probability, secure an appointment as governor with its corresponding benefits. It has been calculated that a governor so appointed has, in <num value="12">twelve</num> years from his appointment, through his nominees, received a benefit of over <measure value="900l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="900">900</num></measure> from the charity. Whether the charity was founded with this intention, we leave our readers to judge.   No doubt, in many cases the <hi rend=italics>quasi-pur-</hi>
 chased presentations relieve distressed parents, but there can be no doubt that many of the children in the school (we might almost say the larger number) belong to a class of persons perfectly able to support them, without any appeal to the funds of the charity. 
<P>The education given at the hospital is of a superior class, and many of the past students have taken high honours at both universities. Between <num value="20">twenty</num> and <num value="30">thirty</num> masters are employed as the London staff, of whom we remark that the head master receives what appears a very small sum for such a position. 
<P>The eminent <QUOTE>Blues</QUOTE> of former times, whom we have before epitomised, deserve a word or <num value="2">two</num> to themselves.   Edmund Campian, the celebrated Jesuit, after a quiet life as a professor of rhetoric in a Catholic college at Prague, came to England proselytising, but being seized by Walsingham, Elizabeth's zealous Secretary of State, was tried, found guilty, and hung at Tyburn, in <datestruct value="1581--"><year reg="1581">1581</year></datestruct>.   William Camden, that patriarch of English antiquaries, whose indefatigable researches and study of Saxon rendered his work of special value, was finally appointed by Sir Fulke Greville, his friend, to a post in the Heralds' College. Camden, as a herald, was consulted by Bacon as to the ceremonies for creating him viscount. In his old age Camden founded a history lecture at Oxford, and died at his house at Chiselhurst, in Kent (afterwards occupied by the French ex-emperor), in <datestruct value="1623--"><year reg="1623">1623</year></datestruct>. Camden's papers relative to ecclesiastical affairs belonged to Archbishop Laud, and were, it is supposed, destroyed by Prynne and Hugh Peters. Camden seems to have been an easy, unruffled man.   He was accused by his enemies of borrowing too freely, and without acknowledgment, from his predecessor, Leland. He wrote some by no means indifferent Latin poetry, and an epitaph on Mary Queen of Scots.   Joshua Barnes, Greek professor at Cambridge, was another shining light of the Bluecoats. His editions of Homer and Anacreon were in their time celebrated. He died in <datestruct value="1712--"><year reg="1712">1712</year></datestruct>, and on the old scholar's monument it is recorded that he had read <pb id="P.376" n="376"> his small English Bible through <num value="121">121</num> times. Dr. Bentley used to say of Joshua Barnes that <QUOTE>he understood as much of Greek as an Athenian cobbler.</QUOTE> In Emmanuel Library great bundles of Barnes's Greek verses fade and gather dust, together with part of a Latin-Greek lexicon never finished.   Jeremiah Markland, a learned scholar and critic, was another memorable <QUOTE>Blue.</QUOTE> He vindicated Addison's character against Pope's satire, was sneered at by Warburton, and edited many editions of classical works.   Latterly, this worthy scholar lived in retirement, near Dorking, and twice refused the Greek professorship. Poor George Dyer, Lamb's friend, a true <QUOTE>Blue</QUOTE> indeed, was originally a reporter and private tutor. He wrote some weak poems, and edited Valpy's unsuccessful Delphin classics. Dr. Middleton, Lord Bishop of Calcutta, another <QUOTE>Blue,</QUOTE> was early in life vicar of St. Pancras. Val Le Grice, mentioned so lovingly by Charles Lamb, afterwards became a perpetual curate of Penzance, where he helped to found a geological society, and was an opponent of the Methodist revival.   James White, another <QUOTE>Blue</QUOTE> of this epoch, for some time filled a post in the hospital country house.   His <title>Letters of Falstaff</title> were much   applauded by the Lamb set. Meyer, nephew of Hoppner, an eminent engraver, was placed in the hospital by Boydell's interest. He was an eminent portrait-painter, and a friend of George Dyer.   Another great credit to the Bluecoat School was the Rev. Thomas Mitchell, the admirable translator and commentator upon the plays of Aristophanes. Previous to his dexterous rendering, only <num value="2">two</num> out of the <num value="54">fifty-four</num> comedies of Aristophanes had been translated into English. 
<P>Among the pictures in the dining-hall we should not forget a simple-hearted representation of Sir Brook Watson (Lord Mayor) escaping when a boy from the shark that bit his leg off while bathing. This is the work of Copley, the father of Lord Lyndhurst. A wit of the time had the cruelty, from personal knowledge of this worthy Lord Mayor, to observe that if the shark had got hold of Sir Brook Watson's skull, instead of his leg, the shark would have got the worst of it. 
<P>There is a curious history attached to the portrait of a Mr. John St. Arnaud, the grandfather of a benefactor to the hospital, which hangs in the treasury. By the terms of James St. Arnaud's will all the money he left passes to the University of Oxford, if this picture is ever lost or given away; and the same deprivation occurs if this picture is not produced once a year at the general court, and also shown, on requisition, to the Vice-Chancellor or his deputy. As the St. Arnauds had intermarried, in the reign of Henry III., with the luckless Stuarts, there is a tradition in the school that this picture is the portrait of the Pretender, but this is an un. founded notion. 
<P>A very old feature of Christ's Hospital is the public suppers on the <num value="7">seven</num> Sunday evenings preceding Easter, for which pleasant sight the treasurer and governors have the right of issuing tickets. It is a pretty, quaint ceremony of the old times, and was witnessed by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>. The long tables are laid with cheese in wooden bowls, beer, in wooden piggins, poured out from black leather jacks, and the bread is borne in in huge baskets.   The interesting ceremony commences by the steward rapping a table <num value="3">three</num> times with a hammer. The <num value="1">first</num> stroke is for taking places, the <num value="2">second</num> for silence, the <num value="3">third</num> is the signal for a Grecian to read the evening lesson from the pulpit, which lesson is followed by appropriate prayers. The Lord Mayor, as President, is seated in a state chair made of oak from old St. Katherine's Church. A psalm is then sung, which is followed by a short grace.   The <QUOTE>amen</QUOTE> at the end of the prayers, pronounced by nearly <num value="800">800</num> voices, has an electrical effect. The visitors walk between the tables, and mark the happy, excited faces and the commensurate appetite of youth. After supper, about which there is no <QUOTE>coy, reluctant, amorous delay,</QUOTE> an anthem is sung, and the boys then pass before the president's chair in procession, bow, and retire. 
<P>The wards are each headed by their special nurses, who formerly, when the public suppers began at Christmas and ended at Easter, were each preceded by a little Bluecoat holding <num value="2">two</num> high candlesticks, the <QUOTE>trade boys</QUOTE> of each ward carrying the piggins and jacks, the bowls, candlesticks, tablecloths, bread-baskets, and knife-baskets.   It was a prettier sight with lights than it is now by daylight, and it makes <num value="1">one</num> young again to see it. 
<P>The Spital sermons, says Mr. Timbs, are preached in Christchurch, Newgate Street, on Easter Monday and Tuesday, before the Lord Mayor and corporation, and the governors of the <num value="5">five</num> royal hospitals; the bishops in turn preaching on Monday, and usually his lordship's chaplain on Tuesday.   On Monday the children, headed by the beadle, proceed to the Mansion House, and return in procession to Christchurch, with the Lord Mayor and the City authorities, to hear the   sermon. On Tuesday the children again go to the Mansion House, and pass through the Egyptian Hall before the Lord Mayor, each boy receiving a glass of wine, <num value="2">two</num> buns, and a shilling, the monitors halfa- crown each, and the Grecians a guinea. They then <pb id="P.377" n="377"> return to Christchurch, as on Monday.

To this other members of the Royal Family formerly added smaller sums, and the whole was divided among the <num value="10">ten</num> boys who left the school in the year.

<P>The dietary of the boys is still somewhat monastic.   The breakfast, till <datestruct value="1824"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, was plain bread and beer, and the dinner <num value="3">three</num> times a week consisted only of milk-porridge, rice-milk, and peasoup.   The old school-rhyme, imperishable as the Iliad, runs-

<LB>Saturday, pea-soup with bread and butter.</QUOTE>
 The boys like the friars in <hi rend=italics>the</hi> old refectory, still eat their   meat off wooden trenchers, and ladle their soup with wooden spoons from wooden bowls. The   beer is brought up in leather jacks, and retailed in small piggins.     Charles Lamb, as we have seen before, does not speak highly of   the food.   The small beer was of the smallest, and tasted of its leather receptacle.   The milk-porridge was blue and tasteless; the pea-soup coarse and choking. The mutton was roasted to shreds; the boiled beef was poisoned with marigolds. 
<P>There was a curious custom at Christ's Hospital in Lamb's time never to touch <QUOTE>gags</QUOTE> (the fat of the fresh boiled beef), and a <QUOTE>Blue</QUOTE> would have blushed, as at the exposure of some heinous immorality, to have been detected eating that forbidden portion of his allowance of animal food, the whole of which, while he was in health, was little more than sufficient to allay his hunger. The same, or even greater refinement, was shown in the rejection of certain kinds of sweet cake. What <pb id="P.378" n="378"> gave rise to these supererogatory penances, these self-denying ordinances? The gag-eater was held as equivalent to a ghoul, loathed, shunned, and insulted.   Of a certain juvenile monster of this kind Lamb tells us <num value="1">one</num> of his most charming anecdotes, droll and tender as his own exquisite humour. A   gag-eater was observed to carefully gather the fat left on the table, and to secretly stow away the disreputable morsels in the settle at his bedside.   A dreadful rumour ran that he secretly devoured them at midnight; but he was watched again and again, and it was not so. At last, on a leave-day, he was marked carrying out of bounds a large blue check handkerchief. That, then, was the accursed thing. It was suggested that he sold it to beggars. Henceforward he moped alone. No <num value="1">one</num> spoke to him; no <num value="1">one</num> played with him.   Still he persevered.   At last <num value="2">two</num> boys traced him to a large worn-out house inhabited by the very poor, such as then stood in Chancery Lane, with open doors and common staircases. The gag-eater stole

 up <num value="4">four</num> flights of stairs, and the wicket was opened by an old woman meanly clad.   Suspicion being now certainty, the spies returned with cruel triumph to tell the steward.   He investigated the matter with a kind and patient sagacity, and the result was, that the supposed mendicants turned out to be really the honest parents of the brave gag-eater. <QUOTE>This young stork, at the expense of his own good name, had all this while been only feeding the old birds.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>The governors on this occasion,</QUOTE> says Lamb, <QUOTE>much to their honour, voted a present relief to the family, and presented the boy with a silver medal.   The lesson which the steward read upon rash judgment, on the occasion of publicly delivering the medal, I believe would not be lost upon his auditory.   I had left school then, but I well remember the tall, shambling youth, with a cast in his eye, not at all calculated to conciliate hostile prejudices. I have since seen him carrying a baker's basket.   I think I heard he did not do so well by himself as he had done by the old folks.</QUOTE> <pb id="P.379" n="379">

<P>In the year <datestruct value="1348"><year reg="1348">1348</year></datestruct> (Edward III.) a terrible pestilence devastated London. The dirt and crowding of the old mediaeval cities made them at all times nurseries of infectious disease, and when a great epidemic did come it mowed down thousands. The plague of <datestruct value="1348--"><year reg="1348">1348</year></datestruct> was so inappeasable that it is said grave-diggers could hardly be found to bury the dead, and many <num value="1000">thousand</num> bodies were carelessly thrown into mere pits dug in the open fields. 
<P>Ralph Stratford, Bishop of London, shocked at these unsanctified interments, in his zeal to amend the evil consecrated <num value="3">three</num> acres of waste ground, called <QUOTE>No Man's Land,</QUOTE> outside the walls, between the lands of the Abbey of Westminster and those of St. John of Jerusalem, at Clerkenwell. He there erected a small chapel, where masses were said for the repose of the dead, and named the place Pardon Churchyard. The plague still raging, Sir Walter de Manny, that brave knight whose deeds are so proudly and prominently blazoned in the pages of Froissart, purchased of the brethren of St. Bartholomew Spital a piece of ground contiguous to Pardon Churchyard, called the Spital Croft, which the good Bishop Stratford also consecrated. The <num value="2">two</num> burial-grounds, afterwards united, were known as New Church Hawe. 
<P>Stow, in his <title>Survey,</title> mentions a stone cross in this cemetery, recording the burial there during the pestilence of <num value="50000">50,000</num> persons. In <datestruct value="1361--"><year reg="1361">1361</year></datestruct>, Michael de Northburgh, Bishop Stratford's successor, died, bequeathing the sum of <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>, for founding and building a Carthusian monastery at Pardon <pb id="P.381" n="381"> Churchyard, which he endowed with all his leases, rents, and tenements, in perpetuity. He also bequeathed a silver enamelled vessel for the Host and <num value="1">one</num> for the holy water, a silver bell, and all his books of divinity. Sir Walter de Manny, in the year <datestruct value="1371"><year reg="1371">1371</year></datestruct>, founded a Carthusian convent, which he called <QUOTE>The House of the Salutation of the Mother of God.</QUOTE> This he endowed with the <num value="13">thirteen</num> acres and <num value="1">one</num> rod of land which Bishop Stratford had consecrated for burial, and, with the consent of the general of the order, John Lustote was nominated <num value="1">first</num> prior. Sir Walter's charter of foundation was witnessed by the Earls of Pembroke, March, Sarum, and Hereford, by John de Barnes, Lord Mayor, and William de Walworth and Robert de Gayton, sheriffs. 
<P>The order of Carthusians, we may here remind our readers, was founded by Bruno, a priest in the church of St. Cunibert, at Cologne, and Canon of Rheims, in Champagne, in <datestruct value="1080--"><year reg="1080">1080</year></datestruct> (William the Conqueror). Bruno, grieved at the sins of Cologne, withdrew with <num value="6">six</num> disciples to the Chartreuse, a desert solitude among the mountains of Dauphine. A miracle hastened the retirement of Bruno. <num value="1">One</num> of his friends, supposed to be of unblemished life,. rose from his bier, and exclaimed, <QUOTE>I am arraigned at the bar of God's justice. My sentence is just now passed. I am condemned by the just judgment of God.</QUOTE> Bruno died in <datestruct value="1101--"><year reg="1101">1101</year></datestruct>, and miracles soon after were effected by a spring that broke forth near his tomb. 
<P> <QUOTE>Not content,</QUOTE> says <QUOTE>Carthusian,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>with the rigorous rule of St. Benedict, the founder imposed upon the order precepts so severe as to be almost intolerable, and a discipline so harsh, that it was long before the female sex could be induced to subject themselves to such repugnant laws. <num value="1">One</num> of their peculiarities was, that they did not live in cells, but each monk had a separate house, in which were <num value="2">two</num> chambers, a closet, refectory, and garden. None went abroad but the prior and procurator, on the necessary affairs of the house. They were compelled to fast, at least <num value="1">one</num> day in a week, on bread, water, and salt; they never ate flesh, at the peril of their lives, nor even fish, unless it was given them; they slept on a piece of cork, with a single blanket to cover them; they rose at midnight to sing their matins, and never spoke to <num value="1">one</num> another except on festivals and chapter days. On holy days they ate together at the common refectory, and were strictly charged to keep their eyes on the meat, their hands upon the table, their attention on the reader, and their hearts fixed upon God.   Their laws professed to limit the quantity of land they should possess, in order to prevent the luxury and wealth so prevalent among the other orders. Their clothing consisted of <num value="2">two</num> hair-cloths, <num value="2">two</num> cowls, <num value="2">two</num> pair of hose, and a cloak, all, of the coarsest manufacture, contrived so as almost to disfigure their persons.. Their rigorous laws seem to have prevented the increase of their order, for in the height of their prosperity they could not boast of more than <num value="172">172</num> houses, of which <num value="5">five</num> only were of nuns.</QUOTE> 
<P>The London Charterhouse was the <num value="4">fourth</num> house of the order founded in England, the <num value="1">first</num> being at Witham, in Somersetshire, where Hugh, the holy Bishop of Lincoln, was the <num value="1">first</num> prior. The grants to the new London monastery of the Carthusians were no doubt numerous, as we find, among others enumerated in the <title>Chronicles of the Charterhouse,</title> <measure value="260bmark" type=currency><num value="260">260</num> marks</measure> given by Felicia de Thymelby, in the reign of Richard II., for the endowment of a monk <QUOTE>to pray and celebrate the divine offices for the souls of Thomas Aubrey and the aforesaid Felicia, his wife;</QUOTE> also a grant of <num value="1">one</num> acre of land in Conduit-shote Field, near Trillemyle Brook, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, lying between the pasture-land of the Convent of Charterhouse, the pasture of St. Bartholomew's. Priory, and the king's highway leading from Holborn towards Kentish Town. The prior of St. John, Clerkenwell, also frequently exchanged lands, and we find the Prior of Charterhouse granting a trental of masses, to the end that <QUOTE>the soul of Brother William Hulles, the Prior of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, might the sooner be conveyed, with God's providence, into Abraham's bosom.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>About the latter part of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century,</QUOTE> says an historian of the Charterhouse, <QUOTE>we find our convent the home of a future Lord Chancellor of England; for we read that Sir Thomas More  <Q>gave himself to devotion and prayer, in the Charterhouse of London, religiously living there without vow about <num value="4">four</num> years.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P>The Charterhouse had flourished for nearly <num value="3">three</num> centuries in prosperity, its brethren retaining a good character for severe discipline and holy life, when the storm of the dissolution broke upon them. <num value="3">Three</num> of Cromwell's cruel commissioners, visited the Charterhouse, and their merciless eyes soon found cause of complaint. In <datestruct value="1534--"><year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct> John Houghton, the prior, and Humfry Midylmore, procurator, after being sent to the Tower for a month, were released on signing a certificate of conditional conformity. The majority of the brethren refused to subscribe to Henry's supremacy. The exertions, however, of the Confessor to the Brigettine Convent, at Sion House, gradually led the refractory monks to subscribe to the king's supremacy. In <pb id="P.382" n="382"> <datestruct VALUE="1535-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1535">1535</year></datestruct>, the prior, Houghton, whose adhesion had been received with distrust, was arraigned on a vague charge of speaking too freely of the king's proceedings, and he and <num value="2">two</num> other Carthusians, <num value="1">one</num> a father of Sion, the other the vicar of Isleworth, were hung, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn. <QUOTE>As they were proceeding from the Tower to execution, Sir Thomas More, who was then confined for a similar offence, chanced to espy them from the window of his dungeon; and, as <num value="1">one</num> longing in that journey to have accompanied them, said unto his daughter, then standing there beside him,  <Q>Lo, dost thou not see, Megg, that these blessed fathers be now as cheerfully going to their deaths as bridegrooms to their marriage?</Q>  Not long after he followed their steps on his way to the scaffold.</QUOTE> 
<P>The <num value="3">three</num> heads were exposed on London Bridge, and the fragments of Prior Houghton's body were barbarously spiked over the principal gate of Charterhouse. The prior's fate, however, only roused the fanatical zeal of the brotherhood, and the very next month <num value="3">three</num> more monks were condemned and executed.   From   the letter of Fylott, <num value="1">one</num> of the king's assistant commissioners, we learn that though the Charterhouse monks claimed to be solitary, there had been found no less than <num value="24">twenty-four</num> keys to the cloister doors, and <num value="22">twenty-two</num> to the buttery. The monks plainly told the commissioners that they would listen to no preacher who denounced images and blasphemed saints; and that they would read their Doctors, and go no further. 
<P>The monks had not long to rest. In <datestruct value="1537--"><year reg="1537">1537</year></datestruct> the Charterhouse brothers refused, to renounce the Pope by oath, or acknowledge Henry as supreme head on earth of the English Church. Some of the order who had previously yielded now refused to obey, and were at once hurried to prison. The monastery was then dissolved, and Prior Trafford at once resigned.   The majority of the monks consented to the surrender, the prior receiving an annual pension of <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>, and the monks <measure value="5l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5">5</num></measure> each. <num value="9">Nine</num> out of <num value="10">ten</num> brothers, cruelly handled in Newgate, were literally starved to death. The survivor, after <num value="4">four</num> years' misery, was executed in <datestruct value="1541--"><year reg="1541">1541</year></datestruct>. 
<P> <QUOTE>According to Dugdale,</QUOTE> says <QUOTE>Carthusian,</QUOTE> 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>the annual revenues of this house amounted at the dissolution to <measure value="642l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="642">642</num></measure> <measure value="0s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="0">0</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure>, whilst the united revenues of the <num value="9">nine</num> houses of Carthusians in England were valued at the sum of <measure value="2947l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2947">2,947</num></measure> <measure value="15s." type=currency><num value="15">15</num>s.</measure> <measure value="4.25d." type=currency><num value="4.25">4 1/4</num>d.</measure> 
<P>Before the final departure of the convent from London, sundry miracles are said to have been wrought, and revelations to have been made, urging the brothers to abide in the faith, and to bear witness of the truth of the Christian religion at the expense of their lives. Unearthly lights were seen shining on their church. At the burial of <num value="1">one</num> of their saints, when all things appeared mournful and   solemn, a sudden flash   of heavenly flame kindled all the lamps of their church, which were only lighted on great days; and a deceased father of the convent twice visited a living monk who had attended him in his last illness. The narrative of this last pseudo-miracle is given in the following letter, written by the favoured monk : 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><LIST><item>Item. The same day, at <num value="5">five</num> of the clock at afternoon, I being in contemplation in our entry, in our cell, suddenly he appeared unto me in a monk's habit, and said to me,  <Q> Why do ye not follow our father?</Q>  and I said,  <Q>Wherefore?</Q>  He said,  <Q>For he is entered in heaven, next unto angels;</Q>  and I said,  <Q> Where be all our other fathers, which died as well?</Q>  he answered and said,  <Q> They be well, but not so well as he?</Q>  And then I said to him,  <Q> Father, how do you?</Q>  And he answered and said,  <Q>Well enough.</Q>  And I said,  <Q>Father, shall I pray for you?</Q>    And he said,  <Q>I am well enough, but prayer, both from you and others, doeth good;</Q>  and so suddenly vanished away. 
<ITEM>Item. Upon Saturday next after, at <num value="5">five</num> of the clock in the morning, in the same place, in our entry, he appeared to me again, with a large white beard, and a white staff in his hand, lifting it up, whereupon I was afraid; and then, leaning upon his staff, said to me,  <Q> I am sorry that I lived not till I had been a martyr.</Q>  And I said,  <Q> I think that he, as well as ye, was a martyr.</Q>    And he said,  <Q>Nay, Fox, my lord of Rochester, and our father, was next unto angels n heaven.</Q>  And then I said,  <Q>Father, what else?</Q>  And then he answered and said,  <Q> The angels of peace did lament and mourn without measure ;</Q>  and so vanished away.</LIST></QUOTE></QUOTE>
 
<P>The remnant of the order sought refuge in Bruges.   Returning in <datestruct value="1555--"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct>, they were reinstated at Shene, near Richmond, by Cardinal Pole, but Elizabeth soon expelled them, and they fled to Nieuport, in Belgium, where they remained till the suppression of religious orders by Joseph II., in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>.   <num value="1">One</num> of their chief treasures, an illuminated Bible, given the Shene monastery by Henry V., was in existence in the Tuileries in <datestruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></datestruct>. 
<P>The dissolution pressed heavily on the Charterhouse Priory, of which almost all that now remains is part of the south wall of the nave, incorporated in the present chapel. When the monasteries became lumber-rooms, stables, and heaps of mere history materials, Charterhouse was tossed (as Henry threw sops to his dogs) to John Brydges, yeoman, and Thomas Hale, groom   of the king's <QUOTE>hales</QUOTE> and tents, as a reward for their care of Henry's nets and pavilions deposited in the old monastery.   They retained the sacred property for <num value="3">three</num> years, and then surrendered the grant for an annual pension of <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure>.   The king then cast this portion   of God's land   to Sir Thomas Audley, Speaker of the House of Commons, from   whom   it passed to Sir Edward North, <num value="1">one</num> of the king's <pb id="P.383" n="383"> serjeants-at-law, and a privy-councillor in   high favour with the royal tyrant. 
<P> <QUOTE>But even he,</QUOTE> says <num value="1">one</num> historian, <QUOTE>was not free from Henry's suspicion and distrust, as the following anecdote will show:--<num value="1">One</num> morning, a messenger from the king arrived at Charterhouse, commanding the immediate presence of Sir Edward at court. <num value="1">One</num> of North's servants, a groom of the bedchamber, who delivered the message, observed his master to tremble. Sir Edward made haste to the palace, taking with him this said servant, and was admitted to the king's presence. Henry, who was walking with great earnestness, regarded him with an angry look, which Sir Edward received with a very still and sober carriage. At last the king broke out in these words:  <Q> We are informed you have cheated us of certain lands in Middlesex.</Q>  Receiving a humble negative from Sir Edward, he replied,  <Q> How was it then? did we give those lands to you? To which Sir</Q>  Edward responded,  <Q>Yes, sire; your Majesty was pleased so to do.</Q>  The king, after some little pause, put on a milder countenance, and calling him to a cupboard, conferred privately with him for a long time; whereby the servant saw the king could not spare his master's service yet. From this period Sir Edward advanced still higher in the estimation of the king, and at his death received a legacy of <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure>, besides being included among the <num value="16">sixteen</num> guardians appointed during the minority of his son, Edward VI. North was compelled to acknowledge Lady Jane Grey's right to the throne, but subsequently changed his opinions, and was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> to proclaim the Princess Mary queen. For his flexibility he was soon after reelected to the Privy Council, and elevated to the peerage, <datestruct VALUE="1554-02-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct>, being then summoned to Parliament by the title of Baron North.</QUOTE> 
<P>Sir Edward North conveyed Charterhouse to the Duke of Northumberland; but on the execution of the duke the house was granted again to Sir Edward North. In <datestruct value="1558--"><year reg="1558">1558</year></datestruct>, on her journey from Hatfield to London, Queen Elizabeth was met at Highgate by the Lord Mayor and corporation, and conducted to Charterhouse, where she stayed many days. In <datestruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct> Elizabeth made another visit to Lord North, and remained with him <num value="4">four</num> days. This visit is supposed to have crippled this nobleman, who lived in privacy the remainder of his days, but was, in compensation, appointed Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely. Lord North died in <datestruct value="1564--"><year reg="1564">1564</year></datestruct>; and his son Roger sold Charterhouse in <datestruct value="1565--"><year reg="1565">1565</year></datestruct> to the Duke of Norfolk (without Pardon Chapel and Whitewell Beach) for <measure value="2500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2500">2,500</num></measure>, and for a further <measure value="320l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="320">320</num></measure> eventually surrendered the rest of the estate. 
<P> <QUOTE>Here the duke,</QUOTE> says the author of the <title>Chronicles of the Charterhouse,</title> <QUOTE>resided till the year <datestruct value="1569"><year reg="1569">1569</year></datestruct>, when he was committed to the Tower for being implicated in a conspiracy for the restoration of Mary Queen of Scots, and for engaging in a design of espousal between himself and fallen royalty. From the Tower he was released in the following year, and allowed to return to the Charterhouse; but he resumed his traitorous idea of marriage, and his papers and correspondence being discovered in concealment, some under the roof of his house, and others under the door-mat of his bedchamber, he was attainted of high treason, and again incarcerated in the Tower, on the <datestruct VALUE="1571-09-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1571">1571</year></datestruct>. This unfortunate nobleman suffered on the scaffold in the year <datestruct value="1572"><year reg="1572">1572</year></datestruct>, when the Charterhouse, along with his other estates, escheated to the Crown. His son Philip, Earl of Arundel, was impeached in <datestruct value="1590--"><year reg="1590">1590</year></datestruct>, for also favouring Mary, and died in prison in the year <datestruct value="1595"><year reg="1595">1595</year></datestruct>, most probably escaping by disease a more disgraceful and ignominious death by the hands of the executioner.</QUOTE> 
<P>On the death of Mary Queen of Scots, that fair siren who had been so fatal to the House of Norfolk, Elizabeth generously returned the forfeited estates to   the Norfolk family, Lord Thomas Howard, the duke's <num value="2">second</num> son, receiving Charterhouse.   The   Howards flourished better under King James, who remembered they had assisted his mother, and   he visited   Charterhouse for several days, knighted more than <num value="80">eighty</num> gentlemen there, and soon after made Lord Howard Earl of Suffolk. Of this earl, Charterhouse-or Howard House, as it was now called--was purchased by that remarkable man, Thomas Sutton, the founder of <num value="1">one</num> of London's greatest and most permanent charities. 
<P> <QUOTE>Of noble and worthy parentage, this gentleman,</QUOTE> says the author of the <title>Chronicles of the Charterhouse,</title> <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>descended from <num value="1">one</num> of the most ancient families of Lincolnshire, was born at Knaith, in that county, in the year <datestruct value="1531"><year reg="1531">1531</year></datestruct>.   His father was Edward Sutton, steward to the courts of the Corporation of Lincoln, son of Thomas Sutton, servant to Edward IV.; and his mother, Jane, daughter of Robert Stapleton, Esq., a branch of the noble family of the Stapletons of Yorkshire, <num value="1">one</num> of whom was Sir Miles Stapylton, <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> Knights of the Garter, and Sir Bryan Stapylton, of Carleton, 
<foreign lang=la>tempore</foreign> Richard II., also a Knight of the Garter:  <Q>ancestors,</Q>  as the learned antiquary, Herne, justly observes,  <Q>not so low, that his descent should be a shame to his virtues; nor yet so great, but that his virtue might be an ornament to his birth.</Q>  He was brought up for <num value="3">three</num> years at Eton, under the <pb id="P.384" n="384"> tuition of Mr. Cox, afterwards Bishop of Ely, and <num value="2">two</num> years in St. John's College, Cambridge.   In <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>, however, he removed from   Cambridge, without having taken a degree, and became a student of Lincoln's Inn. But here he did not remain long; his desire of travel increasing with his knowledge, and his principles (he being a member of the Anglican Church) compelling him to leave London, he determined to visit foreign parts.   He accordingly departed for Spain, and having stayed there half a year, passed into Italy, France, and the Netherlands. He is said to have taken a part in the Italian wars, and was present at the sacking of Rome, under the Duke of Bourbon. He returned to England in the year <datestruct value="1561"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct>, and through a recommendation from the Duke of Norfolk, he became secretary to the Earl of Warwick, who,  <Q> in consideration of trewe and faithful service to us done by our well-beloved servant, Thomas Sutton,</Q>  appointed him Master of the Ordnance of Berwick-upon-Tweed, and granted him an annuity of <measure value="3l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3">3</num></measure> <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> for life. When Lord Westmoreland's rebellion broke out in the North, the Earl of Warwick created Mr. Sutton Master-General of the Ordnance in that quarter, a post which he himself

After a blockade of <num value="5">five</num> weeks, the castle surrendered on the <datestruct VALUE="1573-05-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1573">1573</year></datestruct>. On his return from Scotland, Mr. Sutton obtained a lease of the manors of Gateshead and Wickham, near Newcastle.   This was the source of his immense wealth, for having  <Q>several rich veins of coal,</Q>  which he worked with great advantage, he had become, in <datestruct value="1585--"><year reg="1585">1585</year></datestruct>, worth <measure value="50000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure>.   The following year he left Newcastle for London, and assisted against the Spanish Armada, by fitting out a ship, named after himself, 
<title>Sutton</title>, which captured for him a Spanish vessel, worth <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure>. 
<P>He brought with him to London the reputation of being a moneyed man, insomuch that it was reported  <Q>that his purse returned from the North fuller than Queen Elizabeth's Exchequer.</Q>  He was resorted to by citizens, so that in process of time he became the banker of London, and was made a freeman, citizen, and girdler of the City. 
<P>Mr. Sutton, being now advanced in years, thought proper to retire from public life. He relinquished <pb id="P.385" n="385"> his patent of Master-General of the Ordnance, and on the <datestruct value="06-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct> following he executed a will, in which he surrendered all his estates in Essex to the Lord Chief Justice, Sir John Popham, and others (with power of revocation), in trust, to found an hospital at Hallingbury Bouchers, in Essex, which place, as will be seen, he afterwards changed for London; and,  <Q>as a proof of his trewe and faitheful heart borne to his dread sovereign, Queen Elizabeth, he bequeathed Her Majesty <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure> in recompense of his oversights, careless dealinge, and fearfulness in her service, most humbly beseeching her to stand a good and gracious lady to his poor wife.</Q> </QUOTE> He also instituted a great many scholarships at Magdalen and Jesus Colleges, Cambridge; his generous will, in fact, being <num value="1">one</num> long schedule of benevolent legacies. 
<P>Among other curious bequests in the interminable will of this great philanthropist, are the following:--<measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> to the fishermen of Ostend, and <measure value="26l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="26">26</num></measure> <measure value="13s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="13">13</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> for mending the highways between Islington and Newington, &amp;c. 
<P>Sutton, who by many is thought to have been the original of Ben Jonson's Volpone, the Fox, that 
<FIGURE id="Fig.385" n="2000.07.0140"><HEAD>The Exterior Of The Hall, Charterhouse.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 insidious legacy-hunter and voluptuary whom the old poet has painted in the darkest colours, lived at this time in a house near Broken Wharf, and between Trig Stairs and Queenhithe, in Thames Street, an old City palace which had once belonged to the Dukes of Norfolk. The death of Sutton's wife seems to have <num value="1">first</num> led the childless millionaire to project some great and lasting work of charity. He was already surrounded by a swarm of carrioncrows, both from town and city, while a jackal pack of advisers followed untiringly at his heels. A Dr. Willet urged him to leave his money to the Controversial College at Chelsea, a ridiculous project encouraged by the king, or to assist James I. in bringing the water of the river Lea to London, by underground pipes. 
<P>The following passage in a letter from   Mr. Hall, of Waltham, afterwards the celebrated Bishop of Exeter, served to fix the old man's determination: 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><p>The very basest element yields gold. The savage Indian gets it, the servile apprentice works it, the very Midianitish camel may wear it; the miserable worldling admires it, the covetous Jew swallows it, the unthrifty ruffian spends it. What are all these the better for it? Only good use gives praise to earthly possessions. Hearing, therefore, you owe more to God, that He hath given you an heart to do good, <pb id="P.386" n="386"> a will to be as rich in good works as great in riches; to be a friend to this Mammon is to be an enemy to God; but to make friends with it is royal and Christian. 
<p>Whatever, therefore, men either shew or promise, happy is that man that may be his own auditor, supervisor, executor. As you love God and yourself, be not afraid of being happy too soon. I am not worthy to give so bold advice; let the wise man Syrach speak for me:-- <Q> Do good before thou die, and according to thine ability stretch out thine hand, and give. Defraud not thyself of thy good day, and let not the portion of thy good desires pass over thee. Shalt thou not leave thy travails to another, and thy labours to them that will divide thy heritage?</Q>  Or, let a wiser than he speak, viz., Solomon :-- <Q> Say not, To-morrow I will give, if thou now have it; for thou knowest not what a day will bring forth.</Q>  It hath been an old rule of liberality,  <Q>He gives twice who gives quickly;</Q>  whereas slow benefits argue uncheerfulness, and lose their worth. Who lingers his receipts is condemned as unthrifty. He who knoweth both, saith,  <Q>It is better to give than to receive.</Q>  If we are of the same spirit, why are we hasty in the worst, and slack in the better? Suffer you yourself, therefore, good sir, for God's sake, for the Gospel's sake, for the Church's sake, for your soul's sake, to be stirred up by these poor lines to a resolute and speedy performing of your worthy intentions. And take this as a loving invitation sent from heaven by an unworthy messenger. You cannot deliberate long of fit objects for your beneficence, except it be more for multitude than want; the streets, yea, the world is full. How doth Lazarus lie at every door!--How many sons of the prophets, in their meanly-provided colleges, may say, not <QUOTE lang=la>Mors in oll&acirc;</QUOTE>, but 
<QUOTE lang=la>Fames</QUOTE>!  How many churches may justly plead that which our Saviour bad his disciples,  <QUOTE>The Lord hath need!</QUOTE>  </QUOTE>
 
<P>This letter fixed the wandering atoms of the old man's intentions. He at once determined to found a hospital for the maintenance of aged men past work, and for the education of the children of poor parents. He bought Charterhouse of the Howards for <measure value="13000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="13000">13,000</num></measure>, and petitioned King James and the Parliament for leave and licence to endow the present hospital in <datestruct value="1609--"><year reg="1609">1609</year></datestruct>.     This <QUOTE>triple good,</QUOTE> as Bacon calls it- <QUOTE>this masterpiece of Protestant English charity,</QUOTE> as it is called by Fuller, was also <QUOTE>the greatest gift in England, either in Protestant or Catholic times, ever bestowed by any individual.</QUOTE> 
<P>Letters   patent for the hospital were   issued in <datestruct VALUE="1611-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>.   Sutton himself was to be <num value="1">first</num> master; but <QUOTE>man proposes, and God disposes.</QUOTE> On <datestruct value="12-12"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=12>12th</day></datestruct> of the same year Mr. Sutton died at his house at Hackney.     His body was embalmed, and was borne   to a vault in   the chapel of Christchurch, followed by <num value="6000">6,000</num> persons.   The procession of sable men from   Dr. Law's house, in Paternoster Row, to Christchurch, lasted <num value="6">six</num> hours. There was a sumptuous funeral banquet afterwards at Stationers' Hall, which was strewn with <num value="9">nine</num> dozen bundles of rushes, the doors being hung with black cloth. Camden, as Clarencieux King of Arms, was on duty on the august occasion.   The sumptuous funeral feast in Stationers' Hall we have already mentioned. 
<P>But what greediness, envy, and hatred often lurk under a mourner's cloak! The <num value="1">first</num> act of Mr. Thomas Baxter, the chief mourner, at his cousin's funeral, was, as heir-at-law, to claim the whole of the property, and to attempt to forcibly take possession of Charterhouse.   The case was at once tried, Sir Francis Bacon, Mr. Gaulter, and Mr. Yelverton appearing for the plaintiff, and Mr. Hubbard, Attorney-General, Mr. Serjeant Hutton, and Mr. Coventry arguing for the hospital.   It was then adjourned to the Exchequer Chamber, where it was solemnly argued by all the judges of the land, except the Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, who was indisposed; and, by Sir Edward Coke's exertions, a verdict was at last given for the defendants, the executors of Sutton. The rascally Baxter (although all impugners of the will were held by Sutton to forfeit their legacies) received the manor of Turback, in Lancashire, valued at <measure value="350l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="350">350</num></measure> a year, a rectory worth   <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>, and <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure> by will. 
<P>But the old man's money had still a greedy mouth open for it.   Bacon, that wise but timid man, that mean courtier and false friend, was base enough to use all his eloquence and learning to fritter away, for alien purposes that would please and benefit the king, the money so nobly left.   Hurt vanity also induced Bacon to make these exertions; his name not having been included in Sutton's list of governors.      Bacon's subtle letter opening   the question is a sad instance of perverted talent. It begins- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote>May it please your Majesty,--I find it a positive precept in the old law that there should be no sacrifice without salt; the moral whereof (besides the ceremony) may be, that God is not pleased with the body of a good intention, except it be seasoned with that spiritual wisdom and judgment as it be not easily subject to be corrupted and perverted; for salt, in the Scripture, is both a figure of wisdom and lasting. This cometh into my mind upon this act of Mr. Sutton, which seemeth to me as a sacrifice without salt; having the materials of a good intention, but not powdered with any such ordinances and institutions as may preserve the same from turning corrupt, or, at least from becoming unsavoury and of little use. For though the choice of the feoffees be of the best, yet neither can they always live; and the very nature of the work itself, in the vast and unfit proportion thereof, is apt to provoke a misemployment.</QUOTE>
 
<P>King James, though eager enough to lay his sprawling hands on the old man's money, which he had left to the poor of London, hardly dared to go as far as such a confiscation as Bacon had proposed; but he dropped a polite hint to the governors that he would accept <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>, to repair the bridge of Berwick-upon-Tweed, and this they reluctantly gave. <pb id="P.387" n="387"> 
<P>In <datestruct value="1614--"><year reg="1614">1614</year></datestruct> the officers of the hospital were appointed, and the Rev. Andrew Perue chosen as master. Sutton's tomb in the Charterhouse Chapel being now completed, the corpse was carried there by torchlight on the shoulders of his pensioners and re-interred, a funeral oration being pronounced over the grave. 
<P>Malcolm   gives the following summary of the property bequeathed in Mr. Sutton's will :--He left <measure value="12110l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="12110">12,110</num></measure>   <measure value="17s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="17">17</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> in legacies, and nearly <measure value="4000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4000">4,000</num></measure> was found in his chest. His gold chain weighed <num value="54">fifty-four</num> ounces, and was valued at <measure value="162l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="162">162</num></measure>.   His damask gown, faced with wrought velvet, and set with buttons, was appraised at <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure>; his jewels at <measure value="59l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="59">59</num></measure>; and his plate at <measure value="218l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="218">218</num></measure> <measure value="6s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> The total expenses of his funeral amounted to <measure value="2228l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2228">2,228</num></measure> <measure value="10s. 3d." type=Currency><num value="10">10</num>s. <num value="3">3</num>d.</measure>, and his executors received, from the time of his decease to <datestruct value="1620--"><year reg="1620">1620</year></datestruct>, <measure value="45163l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="45163">45,163</num></measure> <measure value="9s. 9d." type=Currency><num value="9">9</num>s. <num value="9">9</num>d.</measure> 
<P>At an assembly of governors in <datestruct value="1627--"><year reg="1627">1627</year></datestruct>, among other resolutions passed, it was agreed to have an annual commemoration of the founder every <datestruct value="12-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, with solemn service, a sermon and <QUOTE>increase of commons,</QUOTE> as on festival days. It was also decided that, except <QUOTE>the present physician, auditor, and receiver,</QUOTE> no member of the foundation or lodger in the house should be a married man. 
<P>But the hospital had still another terrible danger to encounter.   King James (who had no more notion of real liberty than an African king), at the instigation of his infamous favourite, Buckingham, demanded the revenues of Charterhouse to pay his army; but Sir Edward Coke, who had saved the charity before, stepped to the front, and boldly repelled the king's aggression.   The hospital at last reared its head serene as a harbour for poverty, an asylum for the vanquished in life's struggle. As an old writer beautifully says, <QUOTE>The imitation of things that be evil doth for the most part exceed the example, but the imitation of good things doth most commonly come far short of the precedent; but this work of charity hath exceeded any foundation that ever was in the Christian world. Nay, the eye of time itself did never see the like. The foundation of this hospital is <foreign lang=la>opus sine exemplo</foreign>.</QUOTE> A   great school had arisen in London, as rich and catholic in its charity as Christ's Hospital itself. 
<P>The governors of Charterhouse are <num value="19">nineteen</num> in number, inclusive of the master. The Queen and the archbishops are always in the list. The master was entitled to fine any poor brother <measure value="4s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="4">4</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> or <measure value="8s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="8">8</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> for any misdemeanour.   He was to accept no preferment in church or commonwealth which would draw him   from   his care of the hospital. The physician was to receive <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> a year, and not to exceed <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> a year for physic bills.   The poor brethren were not to exceed <num value="4">four</num> score in number, and were required to be either poor gentlemen, old soldiers, merchants decayed by piracy or shipwreck, or household servants of the king or queen. 
<P>Herne, in his <title>Domus Carthusiana,</title> a small <num value="8">8</num>vo volume published in <datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>, shows that the world had not been kind to the founder's memory. Herne, in his preface, says: <QUOTE>Sir Richard Baker, Dr. Heylin, Mr. Heylin, and Mr. Fuller say little of him, and that little very full of mistakes; for they call him Richard Sutton, and affirm   he lived a bachelor, and so by his single life had an opportunity to lay up a heap of money, whereas his dear wife is with much honour and respect mentioned in his will. Others give him bad words, say he was born of obscure and mean parents, and married as inconsiderable a wife, and died without an heir; but then, to give some reason for his wealth (having no time nor desire to inquire into the means of his growing rich), to cut short the business, they resolve all into a romantic adventure. They say it was all got at a lump by an accidental shipwreck, which the kind waves drove to shore, and laid at his feet, whilst the fortunate Sutton was walking pensively upon the barren sands.   They report that in the hulk coals were found, and under them an inestimable treasure, a great heap of fairy wealth. This I fancy may go for the fable, and his farming the coal-mines for the moral.</QUOTE> 
<P>Percival Burrell, the preacher of Sutton's funeral sermon thus describes the character of the generous man:-- <QUOTE>He was,</QUOTE> said the divine, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>a great and good builder, not so much for his owne private as for the publicke. His treasures were not lavished in raysing a towre to his own name, or erecting stately pallaces for his owne pompe and pleasure, but the sustaining of living temples, the endowing of colledges, the enriching of corporations, the building causewayes, and repairing of high-wayes. Above all, the foundation of King James his Hospitall, at his sole and proper charge, were the happy monuments of his architecture. Surely this was to be a Megarensis in the best sense--that is, to build for ever. He did fulfill the letter of the apostle, in building <hi rend=italics>gold, silver, and precious stones</hi>; for he commanded plate and jewels to bee sold and converted into money, for the expediting of our hospitall. 
<P>I shall not mention thousands conferred upon friends and servants, but these legacies ensuing merit a lasting memory:--In the renowned University of Camb., to Jesus Colledge, <measure value="500bmark" type=currency><num value="500">500</num> markes</measure>; <pb id="P.388" n="388"> to Magdalen, <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">500</num> pound</measure>; for the redemption of prisoners in London, <measure value="200l." type=currency><num value="200">200</num> pound</measure>; for the encouragement of merchants, <num value="1000">1,000</num>, to bee lent gratis unto <num value="10">ten</num> beginners. Nor was his charity confined within these seas, but that western Troy, stout Ostend, shall receive <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num> pound</measure>, for the relief of the poore, from his fountain. In all these his piety was very laudable; for in many of these acts of bounty, his prime, repose was in the conscionable integrity of the priest, in those places where he sowed his benefits.   Certes, this was to build as high as heaven.</QUOTE>

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 
<P>In a monograph on the Charterhouse, Archdeacon Hale, so long holding the post of master, entered deeply into its antiquities. <QUOTE>The monastery,</QUOTE> said the archdeacon, in the <title>Transactions of the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society</title> for <datestruct VALUE="1869-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>originally consisted of a number of cells, which, with the chapel, chapter-house, sacristan's cell, and little cloister, formed a quadrangle, to which some other irregular buildings were attached. The laundry was in the principal court; and near to it was the sacristan's washing-place, for washing the sacred utensils and vestments.   The waterpipes entered under the cells on the north side of the quadrangle, and the water was received in an octangular building, and which is called the  <Q>Aye,</Q>  the use and derivation of which word has not been discovered.</QUOTE> The water was supplied by pipes running at the back of the cells, and the <QUOTE>lavoirs</QUOTE> were probably washing-places. The brewhouse is not shown in the old plan; its water-supply is only marked, and <QUOTE>the buttery-cock is shown without any building attached to it, whilst the water is described as passing on in <num value="2">two</num> courses to the fleshkitchen, <num value="1">one</num> through the cloister, another through the gateway from the cistern at the kitchen-door, with a branch to a place or house called Elmys and the Hartes-Horne. We thus find <num value="2">two</num> kitchens mentioned; the <num value="1">first</num> denoted by the kitchendoor, and the remains of the <num value="2">second</num> kitchen are to be found in the wall next the present gateway of the Charterhouse, formed of squares of flint and stone. The gateway of the old plan appears disconnected with the rest of the buildings, but it still exists.</QUOTE> We have also the interesting fact, discovered by the diligence of Mr. Burtt, of the Record Office, that the Abbot of Westminster granted to the Prior and Convent of the Charterhouse <num value="3">three</num> acres of land ( <QUOTE>No Man's Land</QUOTE> ) <QUOTE>probably a small piece by the wayside, the consideration for it being only the rendering of a red rose and the saying a mass annually for the sacred King and Confessor Edward.</QUOTE> 
<P>The course by which the water was brought from Islington, across the fields, for the supply of the Charterhouse is shown in old vellum rolls, on which the course passes the windmill, of which the <QUOTE>Windmill</QUOTE> Inn, in St. John Street, was a remnant and a remembrance. The neighbouring Hospital of St. John was, in <datestruct value="1381--"><year reg="1381">1381</year></datestruct>, burnt by the Essex and Kent rebels, when the fire lasted <num value="7">seven</num> days. The hospital does not appear to have been rebuilt before the end of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century, and possibly the ruins of St. John's supplied some materials.   Amongst other interesting fragments was the head of an Indian or Egyptian idol, which was found imbedded in the mortar amidst the rubble.   The connection of the brethren of St. John of Jerusalem with the East suggests the idea that this little figure might have found its way to the Charterhouse from St. John's. 
<P>From a rough sketch accompanying Archdeacon Hale's paper, exhibiting the course of the conduit as it existed in <datestruct value="1624--"><year reg="1624">1624</year></datestruct>, it appears that <QUOTE>the  <Q>Aye</Q>  in the centre of the quadrangle occupied by the monks had disappeared, and that, tie water was brought to a reservoir still existing but now supplied from the New River instead of from the conduit. No record can be found of the time when this exchange took place. The drawing exhibits in a rude manner traces of buildings which still exist, as well as of those which were taken down for the erection of the new rooms for the pensioners some <num value="40">forty</num> years since.   <num value="3">Three</num> sides of a small quadrangle, an early addition to if not coeval with the building of the monastery, still remain; the windows and doorways give evidence <pb id="P.389" n="389">

 of great variety of structure and of date, and the joints of the brickwork proofs of many alterations. There are letters on the west external wall,  <Q>J. H.,</Q>  which we would willingly assume to be the initials of John Houghton, the last prior but <num value="1">one</num>, and the wall itself as of his building.   The cells of the monks, which were in the quadrangle, in the centre of which the conduit stood, have been all destroyed, with the exception of some few doorways still remaining. The buildings of the monastery now existing are on the south side of that quadrangle: they include the chapel, the small quadrangle above mentioned, and the courts of Howard House, including the Great Hall and the court called the Master's Court.   At what time these buildings were erected between the ancient flesh-kitchen, the small quadrangle to the west, and the prior's lodgings on the north, has not been discovered. They were doubtless for the accommodation of strangers who resorted to and were received at the monastery.   It has been said that much information respecting the temper and feelings of the people was obtained by Henry VII. from the knowledge which the Carthusian monks acquired through intercourse thus kept up with various classes.</QUOTE> 
<P>Charterhouse Square has <num value="3">three</num> entrancesCar- thusian Street, Charterhouse Lane, and Charterhouse Street. The <num value="2">two</num> <num value="1">first</num> had originally each a gatehouse, and in Charterhouse Lane, where it stood there is a gate of iron surmounted by the arms of the hospital-arms that have never been blazoned with blood, but have been ever irradiated with a halo of beneficence and charity. Charterhouse Square is supposed to have been part of the ground <num value="1">first</num> consecrated by Bishop Stratford, as a place of charitable burial. A town house belonging to the Earls of Rutland once adorned it, and in this mansion Sir William Davenant, wishing to win the gloom-struck Londoners from   their Puritan severities, opened a sort of opera-house in <datestruct value="1656--"><year reg="1656">1656</year></datestruct>. Rutland Place, a court at the north-east corner of the square, still marks the spot, at the sight of which Cavaliers grew gayer, and Puritans sourer and more morose. A pleasant avenue of light-leaved limes traverses the square, for Charterhouse masters to pace under and archaeologists to ponder beneath. 
<P>As we enter Charterhouse Square from Carthusian Street, the entrance to the old hospital is on the north side. The gateway is the original entrance of the monastery, and has been rubbed by many a monk's gown. This interesting relic is a Tudor arch, with a drip-stone, terminating in plain corbels. Above is a shelf, supported by <num value="2">two</num> lions, grotesquely carved, and probably dating back to the early part of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century. On the right stands the porter's lodge, on the left the house of the resident medical officer. 
<P>From the entrance court are <num value="2">two</num> exits. The road straight from the entrance leads to the quadrangles, the schoolmaster's house, <QUOTE>the Gown Boys,</QUOTE> and the preacher's residences; the left road points to the master's lodge, the hall, and the chapel. In the latter, turning under an archway leading to the head-master's court, is the entrance to the master's lodge. The fine hall of the lodge is adorned by a good portrait of the maligned but beneficent Sutton. In the noble upper rooms are some excellent portraits of illustrious past governors-men of all sects and of various fortunes. Prominent among these we note the following :--Black-browed, saturnine Charles II., and his restless favourite, George Villiers, <num value="2">second</num> Duke of Buckingham; the Earl of Shaftesbury, their dangerous Whig rival, and Charles Talbot, <num value="1">first</num> Earl and afterwards Duke of Shrewsbury--a florid full-length, in robes of the Garter (the white rod the earl carries was delivered to him in <datestruct value="1714--"><year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct>, by Queen Anne, with her dying hand); the ill-starred Duke of Monmouth, swarthy, like his father, in a long black wig, and in the robes of the Garter, and the charitable Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury, who is said to have expended more than <measure value="66000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="66000">66,000</num></measure> in public and private almsgiving, in relieving the sufferers by the Great Plague, and in redeeming Christian slaves from the Moors. The theatre Sheldon built at Oxford was a mark of his respect to the university, and a grateful remembrance of his time studiously spent as warden of the college of All Souls. There is also in an upper room a fine <num value="3">three</num>-quarter length of the clever and learned but somewhat Darwinian divine, Dr. Thomas Burnet, who was elected Master of Charterhouse in <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>; he was the author of the <title>Sacred Theory of the Earth,</title> a daring philosophical romance, which   barred the rash writer's further preferment.   As master, Burnet boldly resisted the intrusion of Andrew Popham, a Roman Catholic, into the house, by meddling James I. <QUOTE>Soon after Burnet's election,</QUOTE> says Mr. Timbs, <QUOTE>James II. addressed a letter to the governors, ordering them to admit <num value="1">one</num> Andrew Popham as pensioner into the hospital, upon the <num value="1">first</num> vacancy, without tendering to him any oath, or requiring of him   any subscription or recognition in conformity with Church of   England doctrine, the king dispensing with any statute or order of the hospital to the contrary. Burnet, as junior governor, was called upon to vote <num value="1">first</num>, when he maintained that, by express Act of Parliament, <num value="3">3</num> Car. I., no officer could be admitted into that hospital without <pb id="P.390" n="390"> taking the oaths of allegiance and supremacy. An attempt was made, but without effect, to overrule this opinion. The Duke of Ormond supported Burnet, and, on the vote being put, Popham was rejected; and, notwithstanding the threats of the king and the Popish party, no member of the communion was ever admitted into the Charterhouse.</QUOTE> This eccentric man--no relation of the great Whig friend of William of Orange-died in <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct>. He appears here as a well-favoured man, in a black gown, and with short hair. 
<P>An arched passage on the left of the master's court leads to Washhouse Court. A porch, surmounted by the royal arms, brings you to the great hall and kitchen, and a passage on the right conducts you to Chapel Court, which is surrounded by buildings to the south and west, by a piazza on the north, and by the chapel on the east. The chapel cloister consists of <num value="6">six</num> Italian semi-classic arches, dull, clumsy, and exactly unsuited to the purpose of the place. Among the gravestones are those of a past organist, Richard John Samuel Stevens (<datestruct value="1757--"><year reg="1757">1757</year></datestruct>), and Samuel Berdmore, master (<datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>). A door at the east end, leading to the ante-chapel, has over it a small tablet to Nicholas Mann,

 English means, <QUOTE>Here lies <num value="1">one</num> who formerly dusted boys' jackets, and is now dust himself.</QUOTE> In the small square ante-chapel is a modern screen, surmounted by the royal arms and those of the founder, Sutton. This ante-chapel is vaulted and groined; the bosses that bind the ribs being ornamented with roses, foliage, and shields, charged with the instruments of the Passion. The font is modern, and of the most Pagan period, contrasting painfully with the perpendicular of the ante-chapel, which bears the date <datestruct value="1512"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct>.   The equilateral arch at the east end, leading to the main chapel, is conjectured by the best authorities to have been the nave-arch of the original monastic church. It is filled up with a carved wooden screen, consisting of a series of pointed cinque-foiled arches. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.391.1">The chapel</LEMMA> is a thorough Jacobean structure, with the founder's tomb conspicuous in a proud position at the north-west corner, the rows of seats where the Charterhouse boys once sat with illcon- cealed restlessness, and the pews of the old brotherhood arranged gravely by themselves. The present chancel, say the antiquarians, is part of the original nave.   It is square, divided in the centre by <num value="2">two</num> Tuscan pillars. An aisle (or, rather, recess) was added to the north side in <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>, and there is a <pb id="P.391" n="391">

The roof is flat, ceiled, and decorated after the style of the time of James I. At the west end, under the tower, is an open screen of wood, carved in a style corresponding with the date of the rest of the chapel. This supports a gallery containing the organ. Its principal ornaments are grotesque, puffy-faced cherubim, helmets and swords, drums, and instruments of music; and in the centre is a shield, tied up with a thick cable charged with the arms of the hospital. The altar is of wood, and on each side in the corner of the chancel is a sort of stall, the <num value="1">one</num> on the right being appropriated to the head-master, and that on the left to the <num value="2">second</num>-master of the school.</QUOTE> 
<P>The east window of <num value="5">five</num> lights, filled with painted glass (the subject the Divine Passion), is the gift of the Venerable Archdeacon Hale, when master of the house. Another east window, representing the Bearing of the Cross, was the result of a subscription among the boys themselves.   In a southern window are some fragments of glass representing the Charterhouse arms. <QUOTE>The pulpit and reading-desk,</QUOTE> says the chronicler of the Charterhouse, <QUOTE>are against the south wall, as also are the master's and preacher's pews; the latter have small canopies over the seats allotted to them. The seats for the pensioners are open, and have at the side poppy heads in the shape of greyhounds' heads, couped, ermine, collared gules, garnished and ringed, or, on the collar <num value="3">three</num> annulets of the last, the crest of the hospital.</QUOTE> The scholars formerly sat in the recess to the north. 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>The founder's tomb on the north side of the chancel is a most superb specimen of the monumental taste in the reign of James I.   It is composed, of the most valuable marbles, highly carved and gilt, and contains a great number of quaint figures, of which the founder is the principal. His painted figure, in a gown, lies recumbent on the tomb. On each side is a man in armour, standing upright, supporting a tablet containing the inscription, and above is a preacher addressing a full congregation. The arms of the hospital are to be seen still higher, and above all a statue of Charity. It is also enriched with statues of Faith and Hope, Labour and Rest, and Plenty and Want, and is surrounded by painted iron railings. The inscription is as follows:--

<P>The other monuments in the chapel are for the most part tasteless and inelegant; there are, however, a few exceptions. On the south wall is a full-sized figure of Edward, Lord Ellenborough, by Chantrey.   He is represented sitting, in his robes as Chief Justice, with the following legend:--

A small door on the right of the cloisters communicates with a spiral staircase leading to the roof of the tower. 
<P> <QUOTE>The tower,</QUOTE> says Carthusian, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>is square, and is surmounted by a heavy Italian parapet, with a thing in the shape of a pinnacle at each angle. The whole is crowned with a wooden dome resting on pillars supporting semicircular arches.   The dome carries on its top a vane representing the Charterhouse arms.   Under this cupola is a bell, which bears the following legend:--

<P>In a vault beneath the chapel is the leaden coffin of Sutton, an Egyptian shaped case, with the date, <datestruct value="1611"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>, in large letters on the breast, the face of the dead man being modelled with a square beard-case. 
<P>A small paved hall leading from the cloister is the approach to the great oak staircase of old Norfolk House, richly carved with shallow Elizabethan trophies and ornaments, the Sutton crest, a greyhound's head, showing conspicuously on the posts, probably additions to the original staircase, which is <num value="6">six</num> feet wide, and consists of <num value="21">twenty-one</num> steps. A   large window midway looks into the master's court. The apartments of the reader are at the top of the staircase, on the right, and on the left an ante-chamber conducts to the terracea grand walk, <num value="80">eighty</num> yards long, which commands a view of the green. Beyond this terrace, to the north, rises the great window of the chapel of the new Merchant Taylors' School. The library, near the terrace, is a grave-looking room, containing a selection of divinity and old Jesuit books of travel, &amp;c., given by Daniel Wray, Esq., whose portrait hangs over the fireplace. 
<P>The governors' rooms part of old Norfolk House, which is next the library, is remarkable for its Elizabethan decorations, which are of the most magnificent description. <QUOTE>The ceiling,</QUOTE> says Carthusian, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>is flat, and is adorned with the armorial distinctions (<num value="3">three</num> white lions) of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, brilliantly painted and gilt. His motto, <QUOTE lang=la>Sola virtus invicta</QUOTE>; is inscribed on ornamental scrolls, tastefully arranged alternately with the date of the year (<datestruct value="1838"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>) in which this remnant of Elizabethan splendour was rescued from ruin. Previous to that time the emblazoned shields, which now glitter so brightly in gold and silver, were well-nigh obliterated with whitewash. The figures in the tapestry then presented a motley mixture of indistinguishable objects; half of the beautifully-carved cornice which now supports the ceiling had vanished. The paintings of the ceiling consist of the following :--In the intercolumniations of the <num value="4">four</num> pillars which form the basement are arabesque shields, containing paintings of Mars and Minerva, and over the space for the stove, representations of Faith, Hope, and   Charity. Above this is a shield, charged with Mr. Sutton's arms, with his initials, T. S., <num value="1">one</num> on each side. A large oval, containing the royal arms, supports this, with the emblems of the <num value="4">four</num> evangelists in the spandrils formed by the square panel, of which it is the centre. On each side is an arch, supported by Ionic pillars, upon which are ovals, in which are portraits of the <num value="12">twelve</num> apostles. The colours used are black, red, and gold. In this room there are <num value="4">four</num> square-headed windows, of <num value="5">five</num>, <num value="4">four</num>, and <num value="2">two</num> lights, transomed. 
<P>The tapestry on the walls consist of <num value="6">six</num> pieces-<num value="3">three</num> of large dimensions, the subjects of which are not known, though many conjectures have been hazarded. The largest piece represents a king, sitting enthroned, crowned, and sceptred; behind him is a woman in plain attire, whilst at his feet kneels a queen, who is followed by a retinue, consisting of <num value="2">two</num> black men, carrying a cushion, upon which rests a model of a fortress, another bearing the key of this citadel, and other attendants. This has been taken for the siege of Calais, and also the siege of Troy. The last supposition is, that it is a representation of the visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon. A <num value="2">second</num> piece has been supposed to represent David, armed by Saul, in the act of sallying forth to meet  <QUOTE>the uncircumcised Philistine.</QUOTE>    <num value="2">Two</num> armies are seen in the background.   Another appears to be a mixture of Scriptural subjects. A scene in the foreground does not much differ from the account of Deborah with Sisera's head, whilst the death of Abimelech is depicted behind. <num value="3">Three</num> other pieces, containing figures of men, some of which are crowned, all which bear a striking resemblance the <num value="1">one</num> to the other, seem intended for the judges and kings of Israel. Similar illustrations are not unfrequently found in ancient Bibles.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Descending the great staircase we enter <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.393.1">the great hall</LEMMA>, the most ancient of the buildings dating subsequent to the Reformation, the west wall being part of the old convent. This wall, the local antiquaries think, was rebuilt by Sir Edward North. The unfortunate Duke of Norfolk, it is <hi rend=italics>supposed,</hi>

Its date, <datestruct value="1571"><year reg="1571">1571</year></datestruct>, marks the time when he was released from the Tower on a kind of furlough, and employed himself here on such improvements as this.   The carving is executed with extreme care and finish. A small sidegallery leads to the great staircase. The room is lighted by <num value="3">three</num> large windows with some stained glass, and there is a lantern in the roof. 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>In the windows are some curious fragments of stained glass. <num value="1">One</num> pane contains the arms of the Lord Protector, Duke of Somerset, encircled by the garter; another contains a collection of pieces, the subject of which is rather ambiguous, the chief objects being a woman walking over a bridge, <num value="2">two</num> horsemen galloping through the water underneath, a ship, the crown of Spain, the arms of Castile and Arragon, and the date, <datestruct value="1670"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>.

<P>The chimney-piece was an addition by Mr. <pb id="P.394" n="394"> Sutton, and is of later date than any other part of the building. It is carved in stone, but is of grotesque design, consisting of imaginary scrolls in the style of the Renaissance school.   The arms of the founder, surmounted by helmet, mantlings, and crest, complete, are well executed; as also are <num value="2">two</num> small pieces of ordnance on each side, which are boldly yet accurately wrought. Beneath these, and in the centre above the space allotted to the stove, is an oval, upon which is carved a dragon, or some fabulous monster. It is now,</QUOTE> adds Carthusian (<datestruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE>very much mutilated.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE><num value="1">One</num> thing yet remains to be spoken of, and that is the noble portrait of Mr. Sutton at the upper end of the hall. He is represented dressed in a black gown, sitting in an antique. high-backed chair, and holding in his right hand the ground-plan of the Charterhouse.   <gap> The room is now used as a dining-hall for the pensioners, and <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.394.1">the banquet is held here on the ever-memorable <datestruct value="12-12"><day reg="12">12th</day>   of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct></LEMMA>.</QUOTE> 
<P>A door on the right opens into the upper hall, a small, low room, adorned by a carved stone chimneypiece, with the founder's arms sculptured above. The windows are square-headed.   It is traditionally supposed to be the former refectory of the lay brothers of the monastery. It was latterly used as a dining-hall for the foundation scholars. A massive door at <num value="1">one</num> corner opens into the cloister. 
<P>A door in the Great Hall, under the music-gallery, opens into a stone passage, on the right of which were the apartments of the manciple. On the left there is an opening into the Master's Court, and in the centre are <num value="3">three</num> doorways with depressed squareheaded Tudor arches, the spandrils being filled with roses, foliage, and angels bearing shields. 
<P>The great kitchen boasts a fireplace, at which <num value="15">fifteen</num> sirloins could be roasted at the same time. In <num value="1">one</num> of the stones of the pavement there are brass rivets remaining, which once fastened down the monumental brass of some Carthusian. 
<P>Returning through the Master's Court and the entrance court, on our way to the <QUOTE>Gown Boys</QUOTE> and the green, we pass a gateway, older than the outer <num value="1">one</num> already described. It has a <num value="4">four</num>-centred arch, but no mouldings or drip-stone. The wall built over it for some height terminates in a horizontal parapet, supported by a plain corbel table.

Some have supposed them   to be the <num value="2">two</num> <num value="1">first</num> letters of our Saviour's monogram, but, upon close examination, it will be found that there are no traces of the final S. The arch beneath, over which is the cross of Calvary, must have had its meaning. It has been suggested that it is the entrance to a burial crypt, and that the letters  <Q>I.

This was called, at the period when Charterhouse was known as Howard House, by the name of the Kitchen Court. Subsequently it obtained the name of the Washhouse Court, and this was changed, some time since, for Poplar Court, on account of some poplar-trees which formerly grew there, but which so inconvenienced the buildings that they were removed a few years since. The name disappeared with them, and the court is now called by its former incorrect cognomen.</QUOTE> This is the most solitary and the most ancient of all the Charterhouse courts. In <num value="1">one</num> corner half an arch can be distinguished, and the square-headed windows are older than they seem. 
<P>The Preacher's Court, with its castellated and turreted modern buildings, was built in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, after the designs of Edward Blore, Esq. The preacher's residence was on the east side. <num value="1">One</num> of the octangular turrets over the northern gateway of this court holds the bell, which rings regularly a quarter of an hour before the pensioners' meals, to call home the loiterers. Some of the poor brethren lodge on the west side. On the south and east sides runs a paved cloister, and at the south-east angle is the large west window of the governor's room, above which <num value="5">five</num> shields are carved in stone. The northern gateway is a depressed Tudor arch, with spandrils filled with the Charterhouse arms. 
<P>The Pensioner's Court, also built in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, has <num value="3">three</num> gateways, but no cloister or octangular tower. The <num value="1">one</num> gateway opens into the stable-yard and servants' quarter, the <num value="2">second</num> into the burial-ground, the <num value="3">third</num> into the Scholars' Court. In this last, at the north-east angle, the head-master used to reside, while the matron favoured a house to the north, and the gown boys' butler sheltered himself cozily at the south-east corner lodge. The stones round the semicircular arch, on the east side, are thickly engraved with the names of scholars once on the foundation, and the date of their departure.

<P>This has occasioned many surmises and suppositions.

<P>The following description of Charterhouse discipline and customs, from   <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></datestruct>, was kindly communicated to us by Arthur Locker, Esq.:-- 
<P> <QUOTE>I was,</QUOTE> says Mr. Locker, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>at the Charterhouse from   <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></datestruct>.   At that time Dr. A. P. <pb id="P.397" n="397"> Saunders was head-master (now Dean of Peterborough); Rev. Oliver Walford was <num value="2">second</num>-master (since dead); Rev. H. W. Phillott and Rev. F. Poynder were assistant-masters; Rev. C.   N. Dicken, the reader, read the daily prayers in the chapel, and also taught in the school. While I was there the numbers of the school varied from about <num value="150">150</num> to <num value="180">180</num>. Of these <num value="44">44</num> (and, at <num value="1">one</num> time, by a special privilege, <num value="45">45</num>) were foundationers, or gown-boys, who were fed, educated, and partially clothed, by the institution.   Each governor (the governors were the leading men of the country, cabinet ministers, archbishops, &amp;c.) selected a boy in turn, as a vacancy occurred, and the eligible age was from <num value="10">ten</num> till <datestruct value="14"><year reg="14">fourteen</year></datestruct>. Most of the gown-boys were either aristocratically connected, or possessed interest with the higher class. The remainder of the boys, whose parents paid for their education, lived respectively in the <num value="3">three</num> boarding-houses of Messrs. Saunders, Walford, and Dicken, and were called Sanderites, Verrites, and Dickenites. There were also about <num value="20">twenty</num> day-scholars. The upper school consisted of the <num value="6">sixth</num> and <num value="5">fifth</num> forms, which had the privilege of fagging; then came the <num value="4">fourth</num> form, a sort of neutral class, neither allowed to 
<FIGURE id="Fig.397" n="2000.07.0144"><HEAD>Street Front Of The Fleet Prison.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 fag or be fagged, and very often, in consequence, great bullies. The lower school (all subject to fagging) were the shell, the <num value="3">third</num>, <num value="2">second</num>, <num value="1">first</num> forms, and the petties. In our house we had <num value="4">four</num> monitors, who exercised some of the duties of masters. They could cane boys for breach of rules, and could put their names down in the black book (<num value="3">three</num> insertions during <num value="1">one</num> week in that volume involved a flogging; and the floggings, administered with long apple-twigs, were very severe). These monitors, and some others of the big boys, had little slips of rooms for their own use, called  <Q>studies,</Q>  and each proprietor of a study had a study-fag, who, besides keeping his books free from   dust and in good order, made his coffee, toasted his roll, washed his hair-brushes, &amp;c. Boys rather liked this special service, as it saved them from the indiscriminate fagging inflicted by strangers. The cricket-fagging was the worst. I have been kept stopping balls behind a wicket for a fellow practising for <num value="5">five</num> hours at a stretch, and beaten on the back with a bat if I missed a ball. Fagging produced laziness and tyranny among the big boys, and lying and deception among the little ones. The monitors, by the way, had a special set of <pb id="P.398" n="398"> fags called  <Q>basinites,</Q>  whose business it was to take care that the basins were filled, towels dried, and soap ready in the monitors' bedroom, for they washed up-stairs. We washed in a public room, fitted up with basins. The dietary arrangements at Charterhouse were under the management of a jolly old redfaced gentleman named Tucker, who had formerly been in the army. He was called the  <Q>Manciple.</Q>  The food was very good; and on Fridays (perhaps as a protest against Roman Catholicism) we fared especially well. Friday was styled  <Q>Consolation Day,</Q>  and we had roast lamb and currant tart, or roast pork and apple tart, according to the season of the year. We <hi rend=italics>said</hi> our lessons in a large building called the New School, in the centre of the <num value="2">two</num> greens; but we learnt our lessons, and had for an in-door playing-place a writing-school of our own. Here, from <num value="8">eight</num> till <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock every evening, <num value="1">one</num> of the masters kept  <Q>banco</Q> --that is to say, everybody was bound to be quiet for <num value="1">one</num> hour, though they might read story-books, or do what they pleased.   We were locked up in our bedrooms at night, the windows of which were further secured by iron bars. The doors were unfastened at <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock, and school began at <num value="8">eight</num>. Cricket was the chief game in the summer quarter; during the rest of the year we had football and hockey. Fives was also played in <num value="1">one</num> of the courts, but tops and marbles were discountenanced, as savouring (heaven save the mark!) of private schools. As a rule, boys are very conventional and narrow-minded. We were kept quite apart from the <num value="80">eighty</num> old pensioners, or  <Q> codds,</Q>  as they were called, and only saw them on Sundays and saints' days in chapel. I remember <num value="2">two</num> in whom we felt an interest-Mr. Moncrieff, the dramatist; and a Mr. Bayzand (or some such name), who had been a harlequin, but who at fourscore had grown a very decrepit, unwieldy man. The upper form boys were allowed the privilege of going out from Saturday afternoon till Sunday evening, at <measure value="9d." type=currency><num value="9">nine</num> p.</measure>m., provided they received an invitation from parents or friends, which invitation had to be submitted for approval to the headmaster. The lower forms were allowed the same privilege every alternate Saturday. At all other times we were strictly confined to our own part of the premises; and many a time have we, imprisoned behind those gloomy walls, longed for the liberty of Goswell Street, the houses of which overlooked our under green. 
<P>The great festival of the year was the <datestruct value="12-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, held in memory of our benefactor, Thomas Sutton, when, after a service in the chapel, a Latin oration was delivered by the head gown-boy, then going to college, and a collection put into the trencher-cap by the visitors who came to hear him. A <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure>, or more, was often thus collected. After this the old Carthusians dined together, and spent the rest of the evening at the house of the master (Archdeacon   Hale).   The master was supreme over the whole establishment, both boys and pensioners: he must not at all be confounded with the <hi rend=italics>school-master</hi>. When a boy left school, his name was engraved on the stone wall which faced the school buildings, with the date of the year of his departure.</QUOTE>
 
<P> <QUOTE>In former times,</QUOTE> says Mr. Howard Staunton, <QUOTE>there was a curious custom in this school, termed  <Q>pulling-in,</Q>  by which the lower boys manifested their opinion of the seniors in a rough but very intelligible fashion. <num value="1">One</num> day in the year the fags, like the slaves in Rome, had freedom, and held a kind of saturnalia.   On this privileged occasion they used to seize the upper boys, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, and drag them from the playground into the schoolroom, and, accordingly as the victim was popular or the reverse, he was either cheered and mildly treated, or was hooted, groaned at, and sometimes soundly cuffed. The day selected was Good Friday, and, although the practice was nominally forbidden, the officials, for many years, took no measures to prevent it. <num value="1">One</num> ill-omened day, however, when the sport was at the best, the doctor was espied approaching the scene of battle. A general <hi rend=italics>sauve qui peut</hi> ensued, and, in the hurry of flight, a meek and quiet lad (the Hon. Mr. Howard), who happened to be seated on some steps, was crushed so dreadfully that, to the grief of the whole school, he shortly after died.  <Q> Pullingin</Q>  was thenceforth sternly interdicted.</QUOTE> 
<P>On the resignation, in <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>, of Dr. Russell (who was appointed to the living of Bishopsgate, the number of the school fell off from about <num value="600">600</num> boys to something about <num value="100">100</num> or <num value="80">80</num>, consequently many of the junior masters were dismissed. 
<P>The poor brothers of the Charterhouse (a very interesting feature of Sutton's rather perverted charity) are now <num value="80">eighty</num> in number. They receive <measure value="36l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="36">36</num></measure> a year, have comfortable rooms rent free, and are required to wear, when in bounds, a long black cloak. They attend chapel twice a day, at halfpast <num value="9">nine</num> and <num value="6">six</num>, and dine together in the Duke of Norfolk's fine old hall. The only special restriction over the old brothers is the necessity of being in every night at <num value="11">eleven</num>, and they are fined a shilling for every non-attendance at chapel--a rule that secures, as might have been expected, the most Pharisaic punctuality at such ceremonials.   This respectable brotherhood used to contain a good many of Wellington's old Peninsular officers, now and <pb id="P.399" n="399"> then a bankrupt country squire, and now and then --much out of place-came the old butler of <num value="1">one</num> of the governors. 
<P>Thackeray has immortalised   his old school, about which he writes so fondly, and with that air of thoughtful regret, that so marks his sadder passages: <QUOTE>Mention,</QUOTE> says the great novelist, in 
<title>The Newcomes,</title> <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>has been made once or twice, in the course of this history, of the Grey Friars' School--where the colonel, and Clive, and I had been brought up--an ancient foundation of the time of James I., still subsisting in the heart of London city.   The death-day of the founder of the place is still kept solemnly by the Cistercians. In their chapel, where assemble the boys of the school, and the fourscore old men of the hospital, the founder's tomb stands--a huge edifice, emblazoned with heraldic decorations and clumsy carved allegories. There is an old hall, a beautiful specimen of the architecture of James's time. An old hall? Many old halls, old staircases, old passages, old chambers decorated with old portraits, walking in the midst of which we walk, as it were, in the early <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. To others than Cistercians, Grey Friars is a dreary place, possibly. Nevertheless, the pupils educated there love to revisit it, and the oldest of us grow young again for an hour or <num value="2">two</num> as we come back into those scenes of childhood. 
<P>The custom of the school is, that on the <datestruct value="12-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, the Founder's Day, the head gownboy shall recite a Latin oration, in praise <foreign lang=la>Fundatoris Nostri</foreign>, and upon other subjects, and a goodly company of old Cistercians is generally brought together to attend this oration; after which we go to chapel, and hear a sermon; after which we adjourn to a great dinner, where old condisciples meet, old toasts are given, and speeches are made. Before marching from the oration-hall to chapel, the stewards of the day's dinner, according to oldfashioned rite, have wands put into their hands, walk to church at the head of the procession, and sit there in places of honour. The boys are already in their seats, with smug fresh faces, and shining white collars; the old black-gowned pensioners are on their benches, the chapel is lighted, and founder's tomb, with its grotesque carvings, monsters, heraldries, darkles and shines with the most wonderful shadows and lights.   There he lies, Foundator Noster, in his ruff and gown, awaiting the Great Examination Day. We oldsters, be we ever so old, become boys again as we look at that familiar old tomb, and think how the seats are altered since we were here, and how the doctornot the present doctor, the doctor of <hi rend=italics>our</hi> timeused to sit yonder, and his awful eye used to frighten us shuddering boys, on whom it lighted; and how the boy next us <hi rend=italics>would</hi> kick our shins during service-time, and how the monitor would cane us afterwards because our shins were kicked. Yonder sit <num value="40">forty</num> cherry-cheeked boys, thinking about home and holidays to-morrow. Yonder sit some threescore old gentlemen-pensioners of the hospital, listening to the prayers and the psalms. You hear them coughing feebly in the twilight-the old reverend blackgowns. Is Codd Ajax alive? you wonder.   The Cistercian lads called these old gentlemen  <Q>codds,</Q>  I know not wherefore-I know not wherefore-but is old Codd Ajax alive? I wonder; or Codd Soldier, or kind old Codd Gentleman, or has the grave closed over them? A plenty of candles light up this chapel, and this scene of age and youth, and early memories, and pompous death. How solemn the well-remembered prayers are, here uttered again in the place where in childhood we used to hear them! How beautiful and decorous the rite! How noble the ancient words of the supplications which the priest utters, and to which generations of fresh children, and troops of bygone seniors, have cried  <Q>Amen</Q>  under those arches I The service for Founder's Day is a special <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="1">one</num> of the Psalms selected being the <num value="37">thirty-seventh</num>, and we hear- <Q> <num value="23">23</num>. The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way. <num value="24">24</num>. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand. <num value="25">25</num>. I have been young, and now am old: yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</Q>  As we came to this verse I chanced to look up from my book towards the swarm   of black-coated pensioners, and amongst them-amongst them-sat Thomas Newcome. 
<P>His dear old head was bent down over his prayer-book; there was no mistaking him.      He wore the black gown of the pensioners of the Hospital of Grey Friars. His order of the Bath was on his breast. He stood there amongst the poor brethren, uttering the responses to the psalm. The steps of this good man had been ordered hither by Heaven's decree : to this almshouse! Here it was ordained that a life all love, and kindness, and honour should end! I heard no more of prayers, and psalms, and sermon after that.</QUOTE>
 
<P>And who can forget the solemn picture of the colonel's death? <QUOTE><num value="1">One</num> afternoon,</QUOTE> says Thackeray, <QUOTE>he asked for his little gown-boy, and the child was brought to him and sate by the bed with a very awe-stricken face; and then gathered courage, and tried to amuse him by telling him how it was a <pb id="P.400" n="400"> half-holiday, and they were having a cricket match with the St. Peter's boys in the green, and Grey Friars were in and winning <gap> At the usual evening hour, the chapel bell began to toll, and Thomas Newcome's hands, outside the bed, feebly beat time; and just as the last bell struck, a peculiar sweet smile shone over his face, and he lifted up his head a little, and quickly said,  <Q>Adsum,</Q>  and fell back. It was the word we used at school when names were called, and lo! he, whose heart was as that of a little child, had answered to his name, and stood in the presence of the Master.</QUOTE>

<P>Among the poor brothers of the Charterhouse who have here found a refuge the rough outer world denied, the most justly celebrated was Stephen Gray, Copley medallist of the Royal Society, and a humble and patient resident here in the early part of the eighteenth century. This remarkable and now almost forgotten discoverer formed the subject of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.400.1">a lecture lately delivered at Charterhouse by Dr. Benjamin Ward Richardson, F.R.S.</LEMMA>,   from which we derive the following facts :--The <num value="1">first</num> time that Mr. Gray was known anything about was in the year <datestruct value="1692"><year reg="1692">1692</year></datestruct>, when he was, perhaps, about the age of <num value="40">forty</num>, and was living at Canterbury, pursuing astronomical studies. In that year he was known to have made astronomical inquiries as to certain mock suns which he saw.   He then, in <datestruct value="1696--"><year reg="1696">1696</year></datestruct>, turned his attention to microscopes, and made <num value="1">one</num> by melting a rod of glass, which, when the end was in a molten state, dropped off and formed a round solid globe, which acted as a powerful magnifier. That, however, was not sufficiently powerful, so he made a more powerful <num value="1">one</num> by having, a hollow globe of glass filled with water, and with this he was enabled to discover animalculae in the water. The same year witnessed a great improvement of his in the barometer. It had been invented some years before, but Mr. Gray hit upon an ingenious method of taking an accurate reading of the instrument. In <datestruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct> the same gentleman observed again mock suns in the heavens, and a halo round the true sun, but did nothing more than record the fact. His next step in science was to obtain a meridian line, after which, in about a couple of years, spots in the sun attracted his attention: Mr. Gray was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> observers of that phenomenon, and in <datestruct value="1706--"><year reg="1706">1706</year></datestruct> he recorded an eclipse of the sun. From   that time to <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, not much was heard of either him   or his discoveries, but in the latter year a letter was sent by Prince George to the Charterhouse, requesting that he might be admitted.   After his admission to the charity he remained without doing much for some time, but at length he recommenced his labour by sending a paper to the Royal Society, denominated <QUOTE>Some New Electrical Experiments,</QUOTE> and some little time after that he became known to Dr. Gilbert, a man of great research. Dr. Gilbert made several experiments with the magnet, as to its power of attraction; he also discovered that amber when rubbed would lead a balance-needle, and in prosecuting his inquiries further, found out that sealing wax, resin, and glass possessed the same qualities, but that they were different from the magnet in many other respects. He therefore named them   after the Greek word for amber 
<hi rend=italics>(electron</hi>), thus bringing into use the word electricity. That was <num value="1">one</num> of the men who took notice of Mr. Gray and his experiments.   About this period some experiments were made with reference to repulsion and attraction by Mr. Gray, which were followed up by Sir Isaac Newton, during which the great philosopher discovered that small pieces of gold leaf and paper placed in a box with a glass lid would fly up to the lid when it was briskly rubbed.   Mr. Gray then discovered if parchment, goldbeaters' skin, and brown paper were heated, they would all attract feathers towards them. A fir rod, with an ivory ball attached to it and placed in a cork, and the tube in a charged glass rod, would also produce the same result. That showed to the ingenious mind of Mr. Gray that electricity could be transmitted from <num value="1">one</num> substance to another. Mr. Gray having discovered that electricity could be so transmitted, was led to try packthread as a conductor. Packthread was accordingly employed, and found to act very well as such a medium when used in a vertical position, but when in a horizontal <num value="1">one</num> it would not carry any spark at all. This discovery was made in a barn by Mr. Granville Wheeler, at Atterden House, near Faversham. The cause of the failure was owing to the fact that the current passed off up to the ceiling. The line was then suspended at distances by means of pieces of silk thread, and when that was done the current passed through to the end of the line. As silk thread was easily broken copper wire was employed, but with no better result, and by that means the discovery was arrived at that there were some bodies which carried off the electric current, and others which concentrated it. After this later discovery the <num value="1">first</num> electric line in <pb id="P.401" n="401"> the world was made on Mr. Wheeler's ground, and a message through a packthread, and attached to a charged glass rod, was sent a distance of <num value="870">870</num> yards from the grounds of Mr. Wheeler up to his garret window. Mr. Gray having thus made <num value="1">one</num> of the grandest discoveries in the world, followed up his researches, and found out that it was not necessary to have contact to pass an electrical current. That was called induction, and some short time afterwards, in <datestruct value="1732--"><year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct>, the Royal Society awarded their gold medal; and in the same year the recipient of the gold medal further contributed to science by discovering that water could be made a conductor, and also that resin could be made to act as a good insulator--a grand discovery, for without insulators we could not make much use of the electric current. In <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct> Mr. Gray also succeeded in obtaining the electric spark, which he did by means of a charged glass rod brought into contact with an iron bar resting upon bands of silk. After this period nothing much was heard of him, and his time was fast drawing to a close. Before that time, however, he invented a machine which he called his planetarium. It was a round box filled with resin, and a metal ball in its centre, over this was suspended a pith pellet, and if the pellet gyrated in a circle the ball was in the centre, but if it were not it would move in an elliptic. By such a means as that he thought he could show a complete planetary system.   He was, however, mistaken, for the twirling of the pith pellet round the globe of metal was no doubt caused by the pulsation of the blood through the fingers. As a further proof of Mr. Gray's intellect, when he obtained the <num value="1">first</num> spark of electricity, he prophesied that electricity generated by a machine would become as powerful as the same force in nature. That, no doubt, will soon be the case, for sheep and other large animals have been instantaneously killed by a machine weighing <num value="15">fifteen</num> hundredweight. 
<P>With all the vices that superstition and laziness could engender, there can never be a doubt among tolerant men that learning owes a deep debt to the much-abused tenants of monasteries. Many great Biblical works and ponderous dictionaries were the products of the indomitable patience of those ascetic workers.   The Carthusian order had, at least, its share of these sturdy toilers, whose life's silent but faithful labour was often summed up in an old brown folio. Among the more celebrated of these patient men we find Theobald English (beginning of the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century), who wrote the lives of all holy men, from the Creation to his own time; Dr. Adam (about <datestruct value="1340--"><year reg="1340">1340</year></datestruct>), whose works are now in the Bodleian, wrote the <QUOTE>Life of Saint Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln,</QUOTE> treatises and works on Tribulation and on the Eucharist; John Olvey (<datestruct value="1350--"><year reg="1350">1350</year></datestruct>) wrote a book on the miracles of the Virgin; Prior Rock, who died   in <datestruct value="1470--"><year reg="1470">1470</year></datestruct>, left dialogues, epigrams, and poems behind him, in MS.; Thomas Spencer (<datestruct value="1529--"><year reg="1529">1529</year></datestruct>) produced commentaries on St. Paul's Epistles; John Batmore, or Batmanson, prior in the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, wrote against Luther and Erasmus; Prior Chauncey, of Bruges, who succeeded Houghton, wrote a <title>History of the Emigration of the Carthusians,</title> and <title lang=la>Passio Octodecim Cartusianorum.</title>

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 
<P>It is difficult to carry the mind back and imagine this old London prison, carted away in <datestruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct>, a building of nearly <num value="7">seven</num> centuries' existence; yet so it was. Stow, to whom a century was a mere trifle, traces it back, in his grave, unpretending way (condensing a week's research in a line), as early as Richard I., who confirmed the custody of his house at Westminster, and his gaol of the Fleet at London, to Osbert, brother of William Longshampe, Chancellor of England. King John, also, says the same writer, handed over the same important, and, as <num value="1">one</num> might perhaps be allowed to think, somewhat incongruous trusts, to the Archdeacon of Wells. The Fleet is proved to have been a debtors' prison as early as <datestruct value="1290"><year reg="1290">1290</year></datestruct>, but it does not figure largely in London chronicles. It was probably as disgraceful and loathsome as other prisons of those early days, the gaolers levying fees from the prisoners, and habeas corpus, that Magna Charta of the unfortunate, being as yet unknown. 
<P>The Fleet Prison was formerly held in conjunction with the Manor of Leveland, in Kent, and appears in a grant from Archbishop Lanfranc as part of the ancient possessions of the See of Canterbury, soon after the accession of William the Conqueror.   That it was burnt by Wat Tyler's men is only another proof of the especial dislike of the mob to such institutions. In Queen Mary's time some of the Protestant martyrs were confined here. Bishop Hooper, for instance, was twice thrust in the Fleet, till the fire at Gloucester could be got ready to burn his opinions out of him. His bed there is described as <QUOTE>a little pad of straw, with a rotten covering.</QUOTE> 
<P>Strype says that about the year <datestruct value="1586"><year reg="1586">1586</year></datestruct> (Elizabeth) the suffering prisoners of the Fleet petitioned the Lords of the Council on the matter of certain grievous abuses in the management of the prison --abuses that were, indeed, never thoroughly corrected.   It was the middleman system   that had led to many evils. The warden, wishing to earn his money without trouble, had let the prison to <num value="2">two</num> deputies.   These men being poor, and greedy for money, had established an iniquitous system   of bribery and extortion, inflicting constant fines and payments, and cruelly punishing   all refractory prisoners who ventured to rebel, or even to remonstrate, stopping their exercise, and forbidding them   to see their friends.   A commission was granted, but nothing satisfactory seems to have come from it, as we find, in <datestruct value="1593--"><year reg="1593">1593</year></datestruct>, another groan arising from the wretched prisoners of the Fleet, who preferred a bill to Parliament, reciting, in <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> articles the misdemeanours and even murders of the obnoxious deputy-warden. <QUOTE>The warden's fees in the reign of Elizabeth,</QUOTE> says Mr. Timbs, <QUOTE>were-An archbishop, duke, or duchess, for his commitment fee, and the <num value="1">first</num> week's <pb id="P.405" n="405">  <Q>dyett,</Q>  <measure value="21l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="21">21</num></measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure>; a lord, spiritual or temporal, <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> <measure value="5s. 10d." type=Currency><num value="5">5</num>s. <num value="10">10</num>d.</measure>; a knight, <measure value="5l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5">5</num></measure>; an esquire, <measure value="3l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3">3</num></measure> <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure>; and even  <Q>a poor man in the wards, that hath <hi rend=italics>a part at the box</hi>, to pay for his fee, having no dyett, <measure value="7s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="7">7</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure></Q>  The warden's charge for licence to a prisoner  <Q>to go abroad</Q>  was <measure value="20d." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>d.</measure> per diem.</QUOTE> 
<P>The fruitless martyrdoms of Mary's reign had not convinced such narrow-minded bigots as Laud of the folly of attempting to convert adversaries by force. The Fleet became the special prison for Star Chamber offenders, including many dogged Puritan lampooners and many generous champions of liberty, and even bishops were crammed into the Fleet for unorthodox conduct. <num value="2">Two</num> of the most historical of the theoretical culprits were Prynne and <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.405.1">Lilburne</LEMMA>. The former tough old lawyer, for simply denouncing actresses, with a supposed glance at the Queen of Charles I., was taken from the Fleet to the pillory, to have his nostrils slit and his ears cut off--a revenge for which the king paid dearly, and gained an inexorable and pitiless foe. Lilburne, <QUOTE>free-born John,</QUOTE> as he was called by the Republicans, was <num value="1">one</num> of the most extraordinary men the dens of the Fleet ever contained, or the Fleet irons ever cramped. For reprinting <num value="1">one</num> of Prynne's violent books, honest John, who afterwards fought bravely in support of his opinions at Edgehill and elsewhere, was whipped at the cart's tail from the Fleet to the pillory at Westminster. Even at the pillory he threw seditious pamphlets to the populace, and when he was gagged, to prevent his indignant orations, he stamped, to express his indignation.   That pleasant letter-writer, James Howell, was also a prisoner here, from <num value="11643">11643</num> to <datestruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct>, when his glasshouse schemes failed, and on his return from his business travels in Italy and Spain. In a letter to the Earl of B--   he describes being arrested by <num value="5">five</num> men armed with <QUOTE>swords, pistols, and bills ;</QUOTE> and he adds, in his usual cheery way, <QUOTE>as far as I see, I must be at dead anchor in this Fleet a long time, unless some gentle gale blow thence, to make me launch out.</QUOTE> 
<P>After the abolition of Laud's detestable Star Chamber court, in <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, the Fleet Prison was reserved for debtors only, and for contempt of the Courts of Chancery, Common Pleas, and Exchequer.   The prison was burnt down in the Great Fire, when the prisoners were removed for a time to Caroone House, South Lambeth, the mansion of the Netherlands ambassador in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. 
<P>Howard, the philanthropist, visited the Fleet for the <num value="1">first</num> time in <datestruct VALUE="1774-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, and, in his <title>State of the Prisons in England and Wales,</title> speaks of it <num value="5">five</num> years later, as clean and free from offensive odours. The building was burnt by the rioters in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, but was immediately rebuilt on the old plan. The new gaol is thus described by Howard:-- 
<P> <QUOTE>At the front,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>is a narrow court. At each end of the building there is a small projection, or wing. There are <num value="4">four</num> floors--they call them galleries-besides the cellar floor, called  <Q>Bartholomew Fair.</Q>  Each gallery consists of a passage in the middle the whole length of the prison, <num value="66">66</num> yards; and rooms on each side of it about <num value="14.50">14 1/2</num> feet by <num value="12.50">12 1/2</num>, and <num value="9.50">9 1/2</num> feet high; a chimney and window in every room.   The passages are narrow (not <num value="7">7</num> feet wide) and darkish, having only a window at each end. On the <num value="1">first</num> floor, the hall-gallery, to which you ascend by <num value="8">eight</num> steps, are a chapel, a tap-room, a coffee-room (made out of <num value="2">two</num> rooms for debtors), a room for the turnkey, another for the watchman, and eighteen rooms for prisoners. Besides the coffee-room   and tap-room, <num value="2">two</num> of those eighteen rooms, and all the cellar-floor, except a lock--up room to confine the disorderly, and another room for the turnkey, were held by the tapster, John Cartwright, who bought the remainder of the lease at public auction in <datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>. The cellar-floor is <num value="16">sixteen</num> steps below the hall-gallery. It consists of the <num value="2">two</num> rooms just now mentioned, the tapster's kitchen, his <num value="4">four</num> large beer and wine cellars, and <num value="15">fifteen</num> rooms for prisoners. These <num value="15">fifteen</num>, and the <num value="2">two</num> before mentioned on the hall-gallery, the tapster lets to prisoners for from <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>s.</measure> to <measure value="8s." type=currency><num value="8">8</num>s.</measure> a week. On the <num value="2">second</num> floor (that next above the hall-gallery) are <num value="25">twenty-five</num> rooms for prisoners; on the next gallery, <num value="27">twenty-seven</num>. <num value="1">One</num> of them, fronting the staircase, is their committee-room. A room at <num value="1">one</num> end is an infirmary; at the other end, in a large room over the chapel, is a dirty billiard-table, kept by the prisoner who sleeps in that room. On the highest storey are <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> rooms. Some of these upper rooms-viz., those in the wings-are larger than the rest, being over the chapel, the taproom, &amp;c. All the rooms I have mentioned are for Master's Side debtors. The weekly rent of those not held by the tapster is <measure value="1s. 3d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="3">3</num>d.</measure>, unfurnished. They fall to the prisoners in succession; thus, when a room becomes vacant, the <num value="1">first</num> prisoner upon the list of such as have paid their entrance-fees takes possession of it. When the prison was built, the warder gave each prisoner his choice of a room, according to his seniority as prisoner. If all the rooms be occupied, a new comer must hire of some tenant a part of his room, or shift as he can. Prisoners are excluded from all right of succession to the rooms held by the tapster, and let at the high rents aforesaid.   The apartments for Common Side debtors are only part of the right wing of the <pb id="P.406" n="406"> prison. Besides the cellar (which was intended for their kitchen, but is occupied with lumber, and shut up) there are <num value="4">four</num> floors. On each floor is a room about <num value="24">twenty-four</num> or <num value="25">twenty-five</num> feet square, with a fireplace; and on the sides, <num value="7">seven</num> closets or cabins to sleep in. Such of these prisoners as swear in court, or before a commissioner, that they are not worth <measure value="5l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5">5</num></measure>, and cannot subsist without charity, have the donations which are sent to the prison, the begging-box, and the grate. Of them there were at <num value="1">one</num> of my visits <num value="16">sixteen</num>, at some other times not so many.</QUOTE> 
<P>In <datestruct value="1726--"><year reg="1726">1726</year></datestruct>, the evils of farming the Fleet having increased to a disgraceful and perfectly unbearable pitch, a Parliamentary investigation took place, and Huggins, the farmer, and <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.406.1">Bambridge</LEMMA>, a low, greedy fellow, who was his lessee, were tried for murder.   The examination of the witnesses led to some ghastly disclosures, which Hogarth, who was present, immortalised in <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.406.2">a picture which at once made him celebrated</LEMMA>.   The following extract from The governor's report discloses infamous cruelty : 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>Jacob Mendez Solas, a Portuguese, was, as far as it appeared to the committee, <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> prisoners for debt that ever was loaded with irons at the Fleet.

<P> The place is a vault, like those in which the dead are interred, and wherein the bodies of persons dying in the said prison are usually deposited, till the coroner's inquest hath passed upon them. It has no chimney nor fireplace, nor any light but what comes over the door, or through a hole of about <num value="8">eight</num> inches square. It is neither paved nor boarded; and the rough bricks appear both on the sides and top, being neither wainscoted nor plastered. What adds to the dampness and stench of the place is its being built over the common shore, and adjoining to the sink and dunghill, where all the nastiness of the prison is cast. In this miserable place the poor wretch was kept by the said Bambridge, manacled and shackled, for near <num value="2">two</num> months. At length, on receiving <num value="5">five</num> guineas from Mr. Kemp, a friend of Solas's, Bambridge released the prisoner from his cruel confinement. But though his chains were taken off, his terror still remained, and the unhappy man was prevailed upon by that terror not only to labour gratis for the said Bambridge, but to swear also at random all that he hath required of him. And this committee themselves saw an instance of the deep impression his sufferings had made upon him; for, on his surmising, from something said, that Bambridge was to return again as warden of the Fleet, he fainted, and the blood started out of his mouth and nose. 
<P>Captain John Mackpheadris, who was bred a merchant, is another melancholy instance of the cruel use the said Bambridge hath made of his assumed authority. Mackpheadris was a considerable trader, and in a very flourishing condition, until the year <datestruct value="1720"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, when, being bound for large sums to the Crown, for a person afterwards ruined by the misfortunes of that year, he was undone. In <datestruct VALUE="1727-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct>, he was prisoner in the Fleet, and although he had before paid his commitment-fee, the like fee was extorted from him a <num value="2">second</num> time; and he having furnished a room, Bambridge demanded an extravagant price for it, which he refused to pay, and urged that it was unlawful for the warden to demand extravagant rents, and offered to pay what was legally due. Notwithstanding which, the said Bambridge, assisted by the said James Barnes, and other accomplices, broke open his room and took away several things of great value, amongst others, the king's Extent in aid of the prisoner (which was to have been returned in a few days, in order to procure the debt to the Crown, and the prisoner's enlargement), which Bambridge still detains. Not content with this, Bambridge locked the prisoner out of his room, and forced him to lie in the open yard, called the  <Q> Bare.</Q>  He sat quietly under his wrongs, and getting some poor materials, built a little hut, to protect himself as well as he could from   the injuries of the weather.   The said Bambridge, seeing his unconcernedness, said,  <Q>----him! he is easy! I will put him into the Strong-room before to-morrow!</Q>  and ordered Barnes to pull down his little hut, which was done accordingly. The poor prisoner, being in an ill state of health, and the night rainy, was put to great distress. Some time after this he was (about <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock at night) assaulted by Bambridge, with several other persons, his accomplices, in a violent manner; and Bambridge, though the prisoner was unarmed, attacked him with his sword, but by good fortune was prevented from killing him; and several other prisoners coming out upon the noise, they carried Mackpheadris for safety into another gentleman's room; soon after which Bambridge, coming with <num value="1">one</num> Savage, and several others, broke open the door, and Bambridge strove with his sword to kill the prisoner, but he again got away, and hid himself in another room. Next morning <pb id="P.407" n="407"> the said Bambridge entered the prison with a detachment of soldiers, and ordered the prisoner to be dragged to the lodge, and ironed with great irons. On which he, desiring to know for what cause and by what authority he was to be so cruelly used, Bambridge replied, it was by his own authority, and,----him, he would do it, and have his life. The prisoner desired he might be carried before a magistrate, that he might know his crime before he was punished; but Bambridge refused, and put irons upon his legs which were too little, so that in forcing them on his legs were like to have been broken, and the torture was impossible to be endured. Upon which the prisoner, complaining of the grievous pain and straitness of the irons, Bambridge answered, that he did it on purpose to torture him. On which the prisoner replying that by the law of England no man ought to be tortured, Bambridge declared that he would do it <num value="1">first</num> and answer for it afterwards; and caused him to be dragged away to the dungeon, where he lay without a bed, loaded with irons so close riveted, that they kept him   in continual torture, and mortified his legs. After long application his irons were changed, and a surgeon directed to dress his legs; but his lameness is not, nor can be, cured.   He was kept in this miserable condition for <num value="3">three</num> weeks, by which his sight is greatly prejudiced, and in danger of being lost. 
<P>The prisoner, upon this usage, petitioned the judges; and after several meetings, and a full hearing, the judges reprimanded Mr. Huggins and Bambridge, and declared that a gaoler could not answer the ironing of a man before he was found guilty of a crime, but it being out of term, they could not give the prisoner any relief or satisfaction.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Notwithstanding the judges' remonstrance, Bambridge, cruel and greedy to the last, did not release the captain from his irons till he had wrung from him <num value="6">six</num> guineas, and indicted him for an imaginary assault. But the case of Captain David Sinclair, an old officer of courage and honour, was even a worse <num value="1">one</num>. Bambridge, who disliked his prisoner, had boasted to <num value="1">one</num> of his turnkeys that he would have Sinclair's blood. Selecting the king's birthday, when he thought the captain would be warm with wine, he rushed into Sinclair's room with his escort, armed with musket and bayonet, struck him with his cane, and ordered the men to stab the poor wretch with their bayonets if he resisted being dragged down to the Strong-room. In that damp and dark dungeon Sinclair was confined, till he lost the use of his limbs and also his memory; and when near dying he was taken into a better room, where he was left <num value="4">four</num> days without food. In the case of Mr. John Holder, a Spanish merchant, the prisoner died from   an illness produced by horror at the miseries of the Common Side to which he had been consigned. 
<P>Bambridge is said to have been the <num value="1">first</num> gaoler of the Fleet who put mere debtors in irons. The old method of punishing drunken and disorderly persons in this prison was the stocks; while those who escaped, or tried to escape, were either set in tubs at the prison gate, or locked in their rooms for several days. This cruel gaoler seems to have defied even habeas corpus, to have stolen charitable bequests, and bribed or frightened the lawyers who came to defend ill-used prisoners. In the case of Sir William Rich, a prisoner who was unable to pay up his arrears for lodging, Barnes, a turnkey, tried to burn him with a red-hot poker; while the warden threatened to fire at him, struck him with a stick, and slashed at him with a hanger. Rich was then loaded with heavy irons, thrown into the dungeon on the Master's Side, and kept there <num value="10">ten</num> days for having, almost unconsciously, in the midst of these cruelties, wounded Bambridge with a shoemaker's knife.   For an application to the Court of Common Pleas Sir William had to pay <measure value="14l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="14">14</num></measure>, the motion costing him <measure value="2l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2">2</num></measure> <measure value="13s. 7d." type=Currency><num value="13">13</num>s. <num value="7">7</num>d.</measure>   In another case the prisoner paid, at his entrance into the Fleet, to judges' clerks, tipstaff, and warden, <measure value="45l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="45">45</num></measure> <measure value="16s." type=currency><num value="16">16</num>s.</measure> 
<P>Although the rascally Huggins and the wretch Bambridge escaped with a fright and a short imprisonment, there is no doubt this Parliamentary inquiry eventually led to reforms in this vilelymanaged prison. A picture by Hogarth of the Fleet Prison Committee was that painter's <num value="1">first</num> real step to popularity. Sir James Thornhill probably obtained his son-in-law permission to sketch the scene, of which Horace Walpole says:-- 
<P> <QUOTE>The scene is the committee.   On the table are the instruments of torture. A prisoner in rags, half-starved, appears before them. The poor man has a good countenance, that adds to the interest. On the other hand is the inhuman gaoler. It is the very figure that Salvator Rosa would have drawn for Iago in   the moment of detection. Villainy, fear, and conscience are mixed in yellow and livid on his countenance.   His lips are contracted by tremor, his face advances as eager to lie, his legs step back as thinking to make his escape. <num value="1">One</num> hand is thrust precipitately into his bosom, the fingers of the other are catching uncertainly at his button-holes. If this was a portrait, it is the most striking that ever was drawn; if it was not, it is still finer.</QUOTE> <pb id="P.408" n="408"> 
<P>The poet Thomson, in his <title>Seasons,</title> finds an opportunity to eulogise Mr. Oglethorpe, whose generous hatred of cruelty led to the formation of the Fleet Committee. With his usual high-toned enthusiasm for what is good, the poet sings :--

The crier might take of a stranger a penny for calling a prisoner to him, and of a complainant twopence for summoning a special committee. For blasphemy, swearing, riot, drunkenness, &amp;c., the committee was to fine at discretion. For damaging a lamp the fine was a shilling.

Common-side prisoners were to be confined to their own apartments, and not to associate with these law-makers. 
<P> <QUOTE>The liberty of the rules, and the <Q>day rules</Q> of the Fleet, may be traced,</QUOTE> says Mr. Timbs, <QUOTE>to the time of Richard II., when prisoners were allowed to go at large by bail, or with a  <Q>baston</Q>  (tipstaff), for nights and days together.   This licence was paid at eightpence per day, and twelvepence for his keeper that shall be with him. These were day rules.   However, they were confirmed by a rule of court during the reign of James I.   The rules wherein prisoners were allowed to lodge were <pb id="P.410" n="410"> enlarged in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, so as to include the churches of St. Bride's and St. Martin's, Ludgate; New Bridge Street, Blackfriars, to the Thames; Dorset Street and Salisbury Square; and part of Fleet Street, Ludgate Hill, and Ludgate Street, to the entrance of St. Paul's Churchyard, the Old Bailey, and the lanes, courts, &amp;c., in the vicinity of the above; the extreme circumference of the liberty being about a mile and a half. Those requiring the rules had to provide sureties for their forthcoming and keeping within the boundaries, and to pay a per-centage on the amount of debts for which they were detained, which also entitled them to the liberty of the day rules, enabling them during term, or the sitting of the courts at Westminster, to go abroad during the day, to transact or arrange their affairs, &amp;c. The Fleet and the Queen's Bench were the only prisons in the kingdom to which these privileges had for centuries been attached.</QUOTE> For certain payments. favoured prisoners were allowed to be long absent; and Mr. Dickens tells a story of <num value="1">one</num> old resident, whose heaviest punishment was being locked out for the night. 
<P>The Fleet was <num value="1">one</num> of the prisons burnt by the insane rioters of Lord George Gordon's mob, in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>. The polite rioters sent a notice the night before that the work must be done, but delayed it some hours, at the request of their restricted friends. The papers of the time mention only <num value="1">one</num> special occurrence during the fire, and that was the behaviour of a ringleader dressed like a chimney sweep, whom every <num value="1">one</num> seems to have insisted on dubbing a nobleman in disguise; or if not himself a nobleman, says a writer in the <title>Gentleman's Magazine</title>, an agent, at least, entrusted with his purse, to enlist conspirators and promote sedition. This quasi-nobleman had, however, more of foolhardiness than cunning in his composition, for he perched himself upon the tiles of the market-house, over against the Fleet Prison, as a mark for the soldiers to shoot at; and as he was on the opposite side of the roof to that where they were posted, at every discharge he popped up his head and assailed them with tiles, till a ball passing through the roof lodged in his heart and tumbled him down. He had gold in his pockets, it is true, but he had no commission, nor was he any other than a pilfering thief, who had well lined his pockets in what to him was a fair way of trade. 
<P>In the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> and early part of the eighteenth centuries couples desiring to be secretly married came to the Fleet and King's Bench prisons, where degraded clergymen could easily be found among the herd of debtors to perform the ceremony. 
<P>In Charles I.'s time a chapel in the Tower (in the White Tower) was a favourite place for clandestine marriages. On Archbishop Laud stopping these illegal practices, hurried lovers then betook themselves to <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="2">two</num> churches at the east end of London-St. James's, Duke's Place, or Trinity, in the Minories. A register of marriages preserved at the former church proves that in <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> years from <datestruct value="1664--"><year reg="1664">1664</year></datestruct> nearly <num value="40000">40,000</num> marriages were celebrated. The fee seems to have fluctuated from between <num value="2">two</num> crowns to a guinea. 
<P>The Fleet Chapel was used for debtors' marriages till <datestruct value="1686"><year reg="1686">1686</year></datestruct>, when the incumbent of St. James's, Duke's Place, Aldgate, being suspended by the Commissioners for Ecclesiastical Causes, made it too popular as a place for secret marriages; and the chapel becoming the haunt of dangerous lookers-on, the degraded clergymen of the prison and neighbourhood began to celebrate secret marriages in rooms of adjoining taverns, or in private houses adjacent to Fleet Street, Ludgate Hill, and the Mint, keeping registers, to give an appearance of legality, and employing touts, to attract and bring in victims. 
<P>Mr. J. C. Jeaffreson, in his valuable work, <QUOTE>Brides and Bridals,</QUOTE> has taken great pains with this subject of Fleet parsons, and has ransacked all possible books, old or new, for information about them. 
<P> <QUOTE>Scanty particulars,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>have been preserved of about <num value="40">forty</num> persons who were keepers of marrying-houses. Some of these persons were turnkeys, or subordinate officials, in the Fleet Prison, like Bartholomew Bassett, who was clerk of the Fleet Chapel, and tenant, at the exorbitant rent of <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>, of the Fleet cellars, where marriages were solemnised secretly. It was at Bassett's office, or private chapel, that Beau Fielding married his <num value="1">first</num> wife, before he fixed his affections on the Duchess of Cleveland.   A few of the <num value="40">forty</num> negotiators in wedlock were women, who had come into possession of a register and marrying business by inheritance. Most of them, however, had in the <num value="1">first</num> instance been simple innkeepers, supplying the public with adulterated liquors before they entered the matrimonial trade. 
<P>Standing in the chief thoroughfares or side-alleys and by-yards of the Fleet quarter, their taverns had signs, some of which still pertain to hostelries of the locality.   For instance:  <Q>The Cock,</Q>  near Fleet Bridge, and  <Q>The Rainbow</Q>  Coffee House, at the corner of Fleet Ditch, were famous marryinghouses, with signs honourably known at the present day to frequenters of Fleet Street taverns. The  <Q>Cock   and Acorn,</Q>  the  <Q>Fighting Cocks,</Q>  the  <Q>Shepherd and   Goat,</Q>  the  <Q>Golden Lion,</Q>  the  <Q>Bishop Blaze,</Q>  the  <Q><num value="2">Two</num> Lawyers,</Q>  the <pb id="P.411" n="411">  <Q>Wheatsheaf,</Q>  the  <Q>Horseshoe and Magpie,</Q>  the  <Q>King's Head,</Q>  the  <Q>Lamb,</Q>  the  <Q>Swan,</Q>  the  <Q>Hoop and Bunch of Grapes,</Q>  were some of the taverns in or near Fleet Street and Fleet Market, provided with chaplains and chapels, or private rooms, in which marriages <NOTE RESP=B><P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.411.1">Fleet Marriages</LEMMA></NOTE> were solemnised on every day and night of the year. William Wyatt-brother of the notorious and very successful Fleet parson, Walter Wyatt --was landlord, <num value="1">first</num> of a public-house in Sea Coal Lane, and afterwards of the  <Q> New Market House,</Q>  Fleet Lane, in both of which houses he drove a great trade, and flourished under his stately brother's patronage. The  <Q> Hand and Pen </Q>  was a sign which proved so attractive to the generality of spouses, that after it had brought success in trade to <num value="1">one</num> house, competitors of the original  <Q> Hand and Pen</Q>  public-house adopted it.   Joshua Lilley's  <Q>Hand and   Pen</Q>  stood   near Fleet Bridge; Matthias Wilson's  <Q> Hand and Pen</Q>  looked out on the Fleet Ditch; John Burnford's  <Q>Hand   and Pen</Q>  kept open door at the foot of Ludgate Hill; and Mrs. Balls had her  <Q> Hand and Pen</Q>  office and registry of marriages within sight of the other <num value="3">three</num> establishments of the same name.   When Ben the Bunter married fair Kitty of Kent Street, he went to the  <Q> Hand and Pen,</Q>  and was fast bound to his damsel by a stout and florid clergyman, for the moderate fee of half-a-crown.</QUOTE>
 
<P>A collection by some enthusiastic collector on this subject exists at the British Museum; he has illustrated a small poem called <title>The Humours of the Fleet,</title> with many sketches of the low prison life.

<P>The Rev. Alexander Keith, who had been reader at the Rolls Chapel, and afterwards incumbent of a Mayfair proprietary chapel, a great place for illegal marriages, on being suspended, excommunicated, and committed to Fleet Prison for <pb id="P.412" n="412"> contempt, in <datestruct value="1743--"><year reg="1743">1743</year></datestruct>, wrote a pamphlet to defend his conduct. The following extract gives some curious examples of the sort of reckless and shameless marriages that were contracted:-- 
<P> <QUOTE>As I have married many thousands, and, con sequently, have on those occasions seen the humour of the lower class of people, I have often asked the married pair how long they have been acquainted. They would reply, some more, some less, but the generality did not exceed the acquaintance of a week, some only of a day-half a day. Another inconveniency which will arise from this Act will be, that the expense of being married will be so great, that few of the lower class of people can afford it; for I have often heard a Fleet parson say that many have come to be married when they have had but half-a-crown in their pockets, and sixpence to buy a pot of beer, and for which they have pawned some of their clothes. 
<gap>  I remember, once upon a time, I was at a public-house at Radcliff, which was then full of sailors and their girls. There was fiddling, piping, jigging, and eating. At length <num value="1">one</num> of the tars starts up and says,  <Q>--me, Jack, I'll be married just now; I will have my partner!</Q>    The joke took, and in less than <num value="2">two</num> hours <num value="10">ten</num> couple set out for the Fleet. I stayed their return. They returned in coaches, <num value="5">five</num> women in each coach; the tars, some running before, others riding on the coach-box, and others behind.   The cavalcade being over, the couples went up into an upper room, where they concluded the evening with great jollity. The next time I went that way, I called on my landlord and asked him concerning this marriage adventure. He at <num value="1">first</num> stared at me, but, recollecting, he said those things were so frequent, that he hardly took any notice of them.  <Q>For,</Q>  added he,  <Q>it is a common thing, when a fleet comes in, to have <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="300">three hundred</num> marriages in a week's time among the sailors.</Q>  <gap>
 If the present Act, in the form it now stands, should (which I am sure is impossible) be of any service to my country, I shall then have the satisfaction of having been the occasion of it, because the compilers thereof have done it with a pure design of suppressing my chapel, which makes me the most celebrated man in this kingdom, though not the greatest.</QUOTE> ( <hi rend=italics>Vide</hi> Keith's <QUOTE>Observations on the Act for Preventing Clandestine Marriages.</QUOTE> ) 
<P> <QUOTE><num value="1">One</num> of these comparatively fortunate offenders against the canons,</QUOTE> says Mr. Jeaffreson, whom we have before quoted, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>was the stately Dr. Gaynam, who lived for many years in Bride Lane, and never walked down Fleet Street in his silk gown and bands without drawing attention to his commanding figure, and handsome though significantly rubicund face. Nothing ever put the doctor out of humour or countenance. He was on several occasions required to bring <num value="1">one</num> of his marriage registers to the Old Bailey, and give evidence in a trial for bigamy; but no gentleman of the long robe ever disturbed the equanimity of the shameless ecclesiastic, who, smiling and bowing courteously to his questioner, answered, <QUOTE lang=la>Video meliora, deteriora sequor</QUOTE>, when an advocate asked him,  <QUOTE>Are you not ashamed to come and own a clandestine marriage in the face of a court of justice?</QUOTE>    Even when Walter Chandler beat him with a stick, the doctor took his caning with well-bred composure. The popular nickname of the doctor declared him the bishop of an extremely hot diocese, but his manner and language were never deficient in coolness. 
<P>Mr. John Mottram, who bore for his arms a chevron argent, charged, with <num value="3">three</num> roses between <num value="3">three</num> crosslets, or, used to marry couples within the walls of the Fleet, not in the chapel of the prison, but  <QUOTE>in a room of the Fleet they called the Lord Mayor's Chapel, which was furnished with chairs, cushions, and proper conveniences.</QUOTE>  It is recorded in the <title>Weekly Journal</title>, respecting this establishment for weddings;  <QUOTE> that a coalheaver was generally set to ply at the door, to recommend all couples that had a mind to be marry'd, to the prisoner, who would do it cheaper than anybody.</QUOTE>  Mr. Mottram could afford to be moderate in his charges, for he transacted an enormous amount of business.   From   <num value="1">one</num> of its registers, it appears that he married more than <num value="2200">2,200</num> couples in a single year. He was a very obliging gentleman, and never declined to put on a certificate of marriage the date that was most agreeable to the feelings of the bride. On the occasion of his trial at the Guildhall, in <datestruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct>, before Lord Chief Justice Parker, it appeared that this accommodating spirit had caused him to enrich certificates of his own penmanship with dates prior to the day of his own ordination.   Convicted of solemnising marriages unlawfully, Mr. Mottram was fined <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure>; but this misadventure did not deter him from persevering in his practices.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Lando was another of these rascals. <QUOTE>Whoever thinks meanly,</QUOTE> says the author of <title>Brides and Bridals,</title> <QUOTE>of the Reverend John Lando, whilom Chaplain to His Majesty's ship <hi rend=italics>The Falkland,</hi>
 holds an opinion at variance with that gentleman's estimate of himself; for Mr. Lando used to inform the readers of newspaper advertisements that he was a  <Q>gentleman,</Q>  who had  <Q>gloriously distinguished himself in the defence of his king and <pb id="P.413" n="413"> country,</Q>  and that he was  <Q>determined to have everything conducted with the utmost decency and regularity</Q>  at his place of business,  <Q>the New Chapel,</Q>  next to the china shop, near Fleet Bridge, London.   His charge for officiating at a wedding, and providing the happy couple with a  <Q>certificate and crown stamp,</Q>  was a guinea. He  <Q>was a regular bred clergyman,</Q>  in spite of the calumnious insinuations of his rivals; and he was  <Q>above committing those little mean actions that some men impose on people.</Q>  In his zeal for the welfare of society, he taught young people Latin and French at his chapel <num value="3">three</num> times a week.</QUOTE> 
<P>But how can we leave this den of misery and infamy without reminding our readers that some years ago a respectable inhabitant of Goswell Street, through the disgraceful duplicity of a person named Bardell, a lodging-house keeper, and the shameful chicanery of <num value="2">two</num> pettifogging lawyers named Dodson and Fogg, spent many months among the sordid population of the Fleet? Need we say that the stout and respectable gentleman we refer to was no other than the celebrated Mr. Pickwick?      On no occasion has Mr. Charles Dickens sketched a part of London with more earnest and truthful care. 
<P> <QUOTE>These staircases,</QUOTE> says Mr. Dickens,   describing what <num value="1">first</num> met Mr. Pickwick's eye when he arrived at the Fleet, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>received light from sundry windows placed at some little distance above the floor, and looking into a gravelled area bounded by a high brick wall, with iron <hi rend=italics>chevauxde-frise</hi> at the top.   This area, it appeared from Mr. Roker's statement, was the racket-ground; and it further appeared, on the testimony of the same gentleman, that there was a smaller area, in that portion of the prison which was nearest Farringdon Street, denominated and called  <Q>the Painted Ground,</Q>  from the fact of its walls having once displayed the semblances of various menof-war in full sail, and other artistical effects, achieved in bygone times by some imprisoned draughtsman in his leisure hours. 
<P>It was getting dark, that is to say, a few gas jets were kindled in this place, which was never light, by way of compliment to the evening, which had set in outside.   As it was rather warm, some of the tenants of the numerous little rooms, which opened into the gallery on either hand, had set their doors ajar. Mr. Pickwick peeped into them as he passed along, with great curiosity and interest   Here, <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> great hulking fellows, just visible through a cloud of tobacco-smoke, were engaged in noisy and riotous conversation over half-emptied pots of beer, or playing at all-fours with a very greasy pack of cards.   In the adjoining room some solitary tenant might be seen, poring, by the light of a feeble tallow candle, over a bundle of soiled and tattered papers, yellow with dust, and dropping to pieces from age, writing, for the hundredth time, some lengthened statement of his grievances, for the perusal of some great man whose eyes it would never reach, or whose heart it would never touch.   In a <num value="3">third</num>, a man, with his wife and a whole crowd of children, might be seen making up a scanty bed on the ground, or upon a few chairs, for the younger ones to pass the night in. And in a <num value="4">fourth</num>, and a <num value="5">fifth</num>, and a <num value="6">sixth</num>, and a <num value="7">seventh</num>, the noise, and the beer, and the tobaccosmoke, and the cards, all came over again in greater force than before. 
<P>In the galleries themselves, and more especially on the staircases, there lingered a great number of people, who came there, some because their rooms were empty and lonesome; others because their rooms were full and hot; the greater part because they were restless and uncomfortable, and not possessed of the secret of exactly knowing what to do with themselves. There were many classes of people here, from the labouring man in his fustian jacket, to the broken-down spendthrift in his shawl dressing-gown, most appropriately out at elbows; but there was the same air about them all--a listless, jail-bird, careless swagger, a vagabondish, who's-afraid sort of bearing--which is wholly indescribable in words; but which any man can understand in <num value="1">one</num> moment if he wish, by just setting foot in the nearest debtor's prison, and looking at the very <num value="1">first</num> group of people he sees there, with the same interest as Mr. Pickwick did. 
<P>In this frame of mind he turned again into the coffee-room gallery, and walked slowly to and fro. The place was intolerably dirty, and the smell of tobacco-smoke perfectly suffocating. There was a perpetual slamming and banging of doors as the people went in and out, and the noise of their voices and footsteps echoed and re-echoed through the passages constantly. A young woman, with a child in her arms, who seemed scarcely able to crawl, from emaciation and misery, was walking up and down the passage in conversation with her husband, who had no other place to see her in. As they passed Mr. Pickwick, he could hear the female sob; and once she burst into such a passion of grief, that she was compelled to lean against the wall for support, while the man took the child in his arms and tried to soothe her.</QUOTE>

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 
<P>The name of this ill-used stream, once fresh and fleet, now a mere sluggish and plague-breeding sewer, is traced by   some to the Anglo-Saxon 
<hi rend=italics>fleotan</hi>, <QUOTE>to float;</QUOTE> and by others, to the Saxon 
<hi rend=italics>fleot</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>flod</hi>, <QUOTE>a flood.</QUOTE> The sources of the river Fleet are on the high lands of Hampstead and Highgate, and the chief of them   rise near Caen Wood. The Fleet was fed by the Oldborne, which rose, says Stow, <QUOTE>where now the Bars do stand,</QUOTE> and ran down to Old Borne Bridge, and into the River of Wells or Turnmill Brook.   The Fleet was also fed by all the springs of Clerkenwell, such as Clerkenwell itself, Skinner's Well, Fogg's Well, Tod's Well, Loder's Well, Rad Well (near the Charterhouse), and the Horse Pool, at Smithfield. 
<P> <QUOTE>The principal spring of the Fleet,</QUOTE> says Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE>rises in a secluded lane at the rear of Caen Wood, the seat of Lord Mansfield; another is on the left of a footpath leading thence to Highgate; and the tiny brooklet formed by its waters communicates by a small arch with a reservoir, the <num value="1">first</num> of <num value="7">seven</num> storage-ponds, on different levels, belonging to the Hampstead Water Company. Another of the spring-heads rises in the midst of Caen Wood. All <num value="3">three</num> springs are diverted so as to fill the reservoirs above mentioned, a small stream carrying off the redundant water, which is very trifling, except in wet seasons. A <num value="4">fourth</num> spring flows from the Vale of Health, at Hampstead, in a narrow channel, to another of the reservoirs, which are connected by means of large pipes passing from <num value="1">one</num> to another. At a lower level the main stream meanders through the fields between Haverstock Hill and Kentish Town, in a wide, deep, and rugged   channel, indicating that a considerable body of water must have originally flowed through it with a rapid current, The name of Kentish Town, which was formerly a mere country village, is supplied by tradition, which ascribes its origin to the place being situated on the bank of a stream (the river Fleet) which rose among the hills about Caen or Ken Wood, and which was formerly called Ken or Caen Ditch, hence Ken Ditch Town, the Town of Ken Ditch, or Kentish Town.   But the correctness of this etymology has been questioned by at least <num value="1">one</num> historian. The Fleet passes on through Kentish Town, its course there being much hidden, and, flowing in a south-east direction, it passes under the Regent's Canal to St. Pancras, where, until the year <datestruct value="1766"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct>, when it was arched over, it bore the name of Pancras Wash. Running at the foot of the gardens in the rear of the houses in the Old St. Pancras Road, it arrives at Battle Bridge, and so makes its entrance into Clerkenwell.   Following the line of the Bagnigge Wells Road, its covered course nearly coincides with the parochial boundary in this direction. Passing in an artificial channel alongside the western boundary wall of the House of Correction, its course lies beneath the valley between Turnmill Street and Saffron Hill; thence, under Farringdon Street and Bridge Street, emptying itself into the Thames on the western side of Blackfriars Bridge.</QUOTE> It was called <QUOTE>the River of Wells</QUOTE> as early as the days of William the Conqueror. 
<P>The Fleet seems early to have become impure, and hardly fit to drink, for, in <datestruct value="1290--"><year reg="1290">1290</year></datestruct> (Edward I.), the prior of a Carmelite house in Whitefriars complained of the noxious exhalations, the miasma of which had killed many of the. hooded brethren, and. the corruption of which overpowered the odours of the incense. The Black Friars and the Bishop of Salisbury, whose palace was in Salisbury Court, Fleet Street, also signed the same doleful petition, Mr. Pinks, with whom we do not in <pb id="P.417" n="417"> this case altogether agree, thinks that the Fleet was called the Holeburne, or burne of the Hollow, above Holborn Bridge; and the Fleet, between Holborn Bridge and its embouchure. The Holeburne is distinctly mentioned in Domesday Book. 
<P>In the register of the Nunnery of St. Mary, Clerkenwell, of the time of Richard I. or John, the oldest cartulary extant, mention is made of a meadow near Holeburne, and of a ditch that led from   Holeburne to the mill of the nuns. The garden of the Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem was also situated upon the Holeburne, thus perfectly proving, says an ingenious writer in the 
<title>Gentleman's Magazine</title> for <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>, that Holeburne was only another name for that venerable and injured stream, the Fleet, the southern part of it, the mere embouchure (between Holborn Bridge and the Thames), probably always maintaining the name of Fleet, or Flood. Stow is therefore incorrect in his description of the imaginary stream, the old Bourne. 
<P>The   same acute writer, who signs himself <QUOTE>T. E. T.,</QUOTE> shows, also, that the word <QUOTE>Flete,</QUOTE> referring to a special limited place, is used in the ancient book of the Templars' lands (<datestruct value="1185--"><year reg="1185">1185</year></datestruct>) now in the Record Office; and the word <QUOTE>Flete Hithe,</QUOTE> in the ancient <QUOTE>Liber A, sive Pilosus;</QUOTE> while in the <num value="1">first</num> of King John, the Templars received the grant of a place upon the Flete, near Castle Baynard, to enable them to construct a mill, which was removed in the reign of Edward I., on the complaint of Henry Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, that it had lessened the breadth and depth of water under Holeburne Bridge and Fleet Bridge into the Thames. The holes that gave the Saxon name to the Holeburne are still marked by the sites of Hockley-in-the- Hole and Black Mary's Hole, Bagnigge Wells (both already described by us in previous chapters). The overflowing part of the Fleet, near its foul mouth, probably gave the name to the stream, as the same cause led to the naming the Fleets of the Trent; and the site of Paris Bear Garden, Southwark, now the parish of Christchurch, Surrey, was anciently called Widefleet, from   the overflowing of the trenches at high tides, which formed a large stagnant backwater to a river that, from man's neglect and idleness, has probably caused the death of more Londoners than have been slain in English battles since the Conquest. 
<P>But turning back to earlier times, let us dive far below the deepest Stygian blackness of the Fleet Sewer. To see the antiquities found in the Fleet, which really deserves a daring discoverer's attention nearly as much as the Tiber, let us follow Mr. Pinks into the vast rag and bone shop of relics which his loving and patient industry has catalogued so carefully.   During the digging   and widening of the Fleet Ditch, in <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>, there, at a depth of <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet, was found the stray rubbish bones, and refuse of Roman London. The coins were of silver, copper, and brass, but none of gold. The silver was ring-money, of several sizes, the largest as big as a crown, the smallest about the size of a silver twopence,. every <num value="1">one</num> having a snip in the edge. At Holborn Bridge, thrown away by spoilers or dropped by thieves, were <num value="2">two</num> brass Lares (about <num value="4">four</num> inches high), <num value="1">one</num> a Ceres, the other a Bacchus, both covered with a petrified crust, but the stream   had washed much of the oxydizing matter from the coins, <QUOTE>thrown away on the approach of Boadicea,</QUOTE> says the vivacious and imaginative Pennant, his mind, like a true antiquary, of course reverting to the <num value="1">one</num> special crisis of interest in ancient London story.   The excavators also discovered in the miserly river various British and Saxon antiquities of interestarrow- heads, broad spur rowels, keys, daggers, scales, seals, with Saxon names, ships' counters, with Saxon characters, and medals, crosses, and crucifixes, of a later date. In the bed of the Fleet, at Black Mary's. Hole, near the end of Baker Street, a ship's anchor, it is said, was found some years ago; and a correspondent in the <title>Gentleman's Magazine</title> (<datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>) describes a small anchor, <num value="3">three</num> feet <num value="10">ten</num> inches long, found in the Fleet Ditch, as then in. the collection of Mr. Walter Hawkins, F.S.A. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct> there was exhibited at the British Archaeological Association a globular iron padlock, so constructed that the whole shackle could be drawn out when the bolt was thrown back. This was found in the Fleet Ditch, near the bottom of Holborn Hill.   In <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct> the same association exhibited a jug of hard-baked pottery (the upper part covered with mottled green glaze), of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, found in <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>, in the ditch, near Smithfield. In <datestruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct> a beautiful hunting-knife, of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, was found in the same dirty repository of <QUOTE>unconsidered trifles.</QUOTE> The ivory haft was wrought with a figure of Mercury, with winged petasus, hunting-horn and caduceus. The blade was of the time of George I. About <datestruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></datestruct> <num value="2">two</num> target bosses, of latten, of the time of Henry VIII., were dredged up.   In <datestruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></datestruct> Mr. Gunston exhibited, at the British Archaeological meeting, a rude penknife of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num>, and <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, both Fleet relics; also the carved wooden haft of a dagger, and a little knife, the bone haft carved with a female bust that resembled Catherine de Medicis; also a knifeblade, with a motto, and a Roman sharpening steel. <pb id="P.418" n="418"> 
<P>Stow says that before <datestruct value="1307--"><year reg="1307">1307</year></datestruct> <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> ships used to go up the Fleet to Fleet Bridge, <QUOTE>with divers things and merchandizes, and some of these ships went under the bridge unto Holborn Bridge.</QUOTE> A <title>Process of Recognition,</title> in <num value="3">third</num> folio of the ancient <title>Liber A, sive Pilosus,</title> containing the ancient evidences of the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, mentions Fleet Hythe as in the possession of Henry the Woodmonger, a man, says Mr. Pinks, mentioned in the great <title>Roll of the Pipe</title> for the <num value="31">31st</num> of Henry I., and also in the <title>Registrum de Clerkenwell,</title> as <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest donors to the Clerkenwell nunnery.   The process shows that ships and store-barges belonging to the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's unshipped their lading at Fleet Hythe, and that the owners complained of a toll there exacted from them. The river was no doubt navigable, ages ago, much further than Holborn Bridge.

<P>Several years ago, on making a great sewer, some piles of oak, apparently portions of a mill-dam, were found in the Fleet Ditch, <num value="13">thirteen</num> feet below the surface of Ray Street, near Little Saffron Hill. 
<P> <QUOTE>In <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> says Mr. Timbs, <QUOTE>the valley of the Fleet, from Coppice Row to Farringdon Street, was cleared of many old and decaying dwellings, many of a date anterior to the Fire of London. From Coppice Row a fine view of St. Paul's Cathedral was opened by the removal of these buildings.  <Q>In making the excavation,</Q>  says a writer in the 
<title>Builder</title>,  <Q>for the great sewer which now conveys from view the Fleet Ditch, at a depth of about <num value="13">thirteen</num> feet below the surface in Ray Street, near the corner of Little Saffron Hill, the workmen came upon the pavement of an old street, consisting of very large blocks of ragstone of irregular shape. An examination of the paving-stones showed that the street had been well used. They are worn quite smooth by the footsteps and traffic of a past generation. Below the old street was found another phase of Old London. Thickly covered with slime were piles of oak, hard and black, which had seemingly been portions of a mill-dam. A few feet below were very old wooden water-pipes, nothing but the rough trunks of trees. The course of time, and the weight of matter above the old pavement, had pressed the gravel, clay, granite, portions of tiles, &amp;c., into a hard and almost solid mass, and it was curious to observe that near the old surface were great numbers of pins. Whither have the pins gone? is a query which has puzzled many. The now hard concrete, stuck with these useful articles, almost like a pincushion, is a partial reply to the query. The <num value="13">thirteen</num> feet of newer deposit would seem to have accumulated in <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> centuries.   It is not unlikely that a portion of the rubbish from the City, after the Great Fire, was shot here.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P>About the year <datestruct value="1502"><year reg="1502">1502</year></datestruct> (Henry VII.), Lambert, in his <title>London,</title> says that the intolerable Fleet Ditch was cleared, from Holborn to the Thames, and it became once more navigable for large barges, laden with fuel and fish. In <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct> Aggas, in his curious Map of London, marks <num value="2">two</num> bridges over the Fleet-Holborne and Fleet Bridge. Holborne Bridge was situated on a spot between Field Lane and Victoria Street; and the Fleet Bridge, says Mr. Pinks, an excellent authority, about the spot where the present Fleet Street and Ludgate Hill join (the circus between the <num value="2">two</num> obelisks). Southward stood a dwelling-house, or warehouse, opposite the northern end of Bridewell, which reached to the Thames, and was situated on the western side of the Fleet.   From   the dwellinghouse above mentioned as far as the Thames, the Fleet was open, Bridewell Bridge (afterwards built on its mouth) not being yet erected. 
<P>In Stow's <title>Survey</title> Fleet Bridge, without Lud <pb id="P.419" n="419"> Gate, is described as a stone bridge, coped on both sides, with iron pikes, with stone lanthorns on the south side for winter evening travellers. Under this ran the River of Wells, <hi rend=italics>alias</hi> Turnmill Brook, 
<hi rend=italics>alias</hi> the Fleet Dyke, or Ditch. The bridge had been larger in old times, but was lessened as the water-course narrowed. It had either been built or repaired by John Wells, mayor in <datestruct value="1431--"><year reg="1431">1431</year></datestruct>   (Henry VI.), and on the coping Wells <QUOTE>imbraced by angels</QUOTE> is engraved, as on the Standard in Cheape, which he also built. This bridge melted away in the Great Fire, and its successor lasted till <datestruct value="1765"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, when it was removed, to widen Farringdon Street, and the Fleet was abandoned as incapable of improvement, and finally bricked over without any respectful funeral service. Strype, in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, describes Fleet Bridge as having sides breast high, and on them the City arms engraved. At Holborn Bridge the Canal, as it was then called, was fed by Turnmill Brook. The Bridewell and Fleet Bridges adjoining were ascended by steps.   Between the <num value="6">six</num> piers of Fleet Bridge were iron rails and banisters at both sides. The roadway was level with the street. There was a coffee-house (the <QUOTE>Rainbow</QUOTE> ) on the bridge in <datestruct value="1751--"><year reg="1751">1751</year></datestruct>.   The older bridge was a stone bridge of <num value="1">one</num> arch, with no stone parapet, but wooden rails and posts. 
<P>Prynne's <title>Records,</title> folio, <datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>, mention several old records referring to the nuisances of the river of Fleet, and efforts to make it navigable, <QUOTE>as formerly,</QUOTE> to and under Holborn Bridge.   He also quotes from the record itself the interesting petition of the Commons of London (Edward I.), quoted by Stow, complaining of the obstruction of the <QUOTE>Flete River,</QUOTE> the corruption of the air it had. engendered, and the hindrance of the former navigation as far as <QUOTE>Holeburne</QUOTE> Bridge. We have seen from   the Earl of Lincoln's petition mentioned above that <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> ships had been known to bring merchandise as far as the Fleet Bridge, and some of them to penetrate as far as Holeburne Bridge. The commission was issued to perfect the work, which was, however, stopped by the king's death. Prynne quietly urges the Government of Charles II., for the benefit of the health and trade of the City, to make the river navigable to Holborn Bridge or Clerkenwell.

At Fleet Bridge and Snow Hill the conspirators were to wait the onslaught of the king's guard. At Snow Hill there was to be a barricade thrown up, and mounted with <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> ships' cannon, while at Fleet Bridge there were to be several regular. cannon, and a breastwork for musqueteers on each side of the bridge, while the houses on the east bank of the Fleet were o be lined with firelock-men, who were to fire from the windows as the royal troops approached the bridge. There were at least <num value="2">two</num> averns on Fleet Bridge at the Restoration.   In Aggas' Map of London (<datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>, <num value="2">second</num> year of Queen Elizabeth), Holborn Bridge had houses on the north side. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct> (Charles II.), in rebuilding London, after the Great Fire, it was decreed that Holborn Bridge being too narrow for the traffic of London, the northern approach should be enlarged so that the <QUOTE>way and passage</QUOTE> might run in <QUOTE>a bevil line from a certain timber house on the north side thereof commonly called or known by the name or sign of the Cock,</QUOTE> to the <QUOTE>Swan Inn.</QUOTE> Wren, therefore, built the new bridge on the north side of Holborn Hill accordingly; and the name of William   Hooker, Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1673--"><year reg="1673">1673</year></datestruct>-<num value="74">74</num>, was cut on the stone coping of the east approach.

The arch was about <num value="20">twenty</num> feet span. The road from the east intersected the bridge obliquely, and out of the angle thus formed a stone corbel arose, to carry the parapet. The worthy mayor's name and the date were still visible. The width of the bridge was <num value="11">eleven</num> feet <num value="6">six</num> inches, says Mr. Crosby, who had spent many years collecting memorabilia of the Fleet valley. It had probably originally been <num value="12">twelve</num> feet <num value="6">six</num> inches. According to this best authority on the subject, Holborn Bridge consisted of <num value="4">four</num> different bridges joined <pb id="P.420" n="420"> together at the sides, and <num value="2">two</num> of these had been added, to widen the passage.   The entrance of the old Swan Inn, with premises that covered an acre and a half, faced what is now Farringdon Street.

<P>The Fleet seems always to have been a sort of dirty and troublesome child to the Corporation of London. In <datestruct value="1589--"><year reg="1589">1589</year></datestruct> (Elizabeth) the Common Council collected a   <measure value="1000bmark" type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> marks</measure> (<measure value="666l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="666">666</num></measure> <measure value="13s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="13">13</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure>) to draw the springs of Hampstead Heath into <num value="1">one</num> head, for the service of the City, and to scour down the Fleet; but the constant encroachment on the Fleet banks, and the rubbish and dirt thrown into the narrow channel, soon, says Stow, clogged it worse than ever. In <datestruct value="1606--"><year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct> (James I.) flood-gates   were   erected, to   dam   the   water back when required; and   in   Cromwell's   time (<datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>) the sewer was thoroughly cleansed, and many encroachments checked.      The ditch had now become impassable to boats, in consequence of the numerous pigsties on the bank, and the vast quantities of offal and garbage thrown in by the butchers. 
<P> <QUOTE>Fuller,   writing   in <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> says Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE>remarks of the Fleet, that it was so called from   its former fleetness, though now it creepeth slow   enough, not so   much   for age   as   the injection   of   the City refuse   wherewith   it   is obstructed.  In   an early play,   <num value="1">one</num>    of the characters says,  <Q> I was just dead of a consumption, till the sweet smoke of Cheapside and the dear perfume of Fleet Ditch made me a man again.</Q>  In Sir Christopher Wren's design for the rebuilding of London, after the Great Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, we find <num value="6">six</num> bridges between the Thames and Clerkenwell, viz., Bridewell-dock Bridge, Wood-market, Bridge, Fleet Bridge--a bridge in the line of street, from the proposed piazza in Fleet Street to Pye Corner, Smithfield-Holborn Bridge, and Cock Lane Bridge. But this design was not carried out.</QUOTE> 
<P>After the Fire, by cleansing and enlarging of Fleet Ditch, coal-barges, &amp;c., were enabled to come up as far as Holborn Bridge, where Turnmill Brook fell into the wider and equally sable flood. Wharves and store-houses were built on the Fleet side, but they did not prove successful. The channel had <num value="5">five</num> feet of water at the lowest tide. The wharves were <num value="30">thirty</num> feet broad, and had oak rails, to prevent passers-by at night falling in. Sir Thomas Fitch, the bricklayer who built the ditch, made a fortune by it, the cost being, as Ned Ward says, in his <title>London Spy,</title> <measure value="74000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="74000">74,000</num></measure>. 
<P>The <num value="1">first</num> Bridewell Bridge over the Fleet, according to Stow, was of timber, through a breach in the City wall, opposite Bridewell. Hatton, in his <title>New View of London,</title> <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, describes Bridewell Bridge as of stone, and right against the back gate of the prison. It was ascended by <num value="14">fourteen</num> steps, and was pulled down in <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>. 
<P>The bridge at the end of Fleet Lane, called the Middle Bridge, was of stone, and was, like Bridewell, ascended by <num value="14">fourteen</num> steps; the arch being high enough to admit of ships with merchandise to pass under it. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct> (George II.) the Fleet, being so often tried and found guilty, underwent at last its final doom. The City of London petitioned the House of Commons for permission to cover it up out of sight, as all navigation had ceased, it had become impossible to cleanse it, and several persons had fallen in and been suffocated in the mud. A bill was accordingly passed, by virtue of which the fee-simple of the site of the premises on the line of the Fleet Ditch was vested in the Corporation for ever, on condition that proper drains were made, to receive the mud-choked stream.   In <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct> <num value="2">two</num> sewer-arches, <num value="10">ten</num> feet high and <num value="6">six</num> feet wide, were completed. from   Fleet Bridge to Holborn Bridge, and covered over, and the new Fleet Market erected on the site, in <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>. The thing was only half done, after all, for the noisome part, from the corner of Bridge Street to the Thames, still remained open, and was not arched over till the approaches to Blackfriars Bridge were completed, between   <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct>, and   even then <num value="1">one</num> stubborn conservative kept a small, filthy dock still <pb id="P.423" n="423"> uncovered.   In <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct>, a drunken barber, from Bromley, in Kent, was found in Fleet Ditch, stand ing upright and frozen to death. 
<P>Floods of the Fleet were not uncommon, before it was boxed up. In <datestruct value="1679--"><year reg="1679">1679</year></datestruct>, after heavy rains, it broke down the back of several wholesale butcher houses at Cow Cross, and carried off cattle, dead and alive. At Hockley-in-the-Hole barrels of ale, beer, and brandy floated down the black stream, and were treated by the rabble as fair flotsam. In <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct> the Hampstead Ponds overflowing, after a severe storm, the Fleet channel grew into a torrent, and the roads and fields about Bagnigge Wells were overflowed.   In the gardens of Bagnigge Wells the water was <num value="4">four</num> feet deep. A man was nearly drowned, and several <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds'</measure> damage was done in Coldbath Fields, Mutton Lane, and Peter Street and vicinity.   <num value="3">Three</num> oxen and several hogs were carried off and drowned.  A Blackfriars boatman took his boat to Turnmill Street, and there plied, removing the inhabitants, who could not leave their houses for, the rising flood. In <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct> a sudden thaw produced a flood, and the whole space between St. Pancras, Somers' Town, and the foot of the hill at Pentonville was soon under water; <num value="2">two</num> cart-horses were drowned; and for several days persons received their provisions in at their windows, from carts sent round to convey them. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct> a furious thunderstorm caused the Fleet Ditch to blow up. The rush from the drain at the <num value="2">second</num> arch of Blackfriars Bridge drove a steamer against <num value="1">one</num> of the piers, and damaged it. The overflow of the Fleet penetrated into the cellars on the, west side of Farringdon Street, so that <num value="1">one</num> draper alone had <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure> worth of goods destroyed or damaged. In the lower part of Clerkenwell, where the sewer ran open, the effects of the flood were most severe, especially in the valley below Brook Hill and Vine Street. In Bull's Head Court, Peter Street, the water rose <num value="5">five</num> feet, and swept away cattle and furniture. <num value="3">Three</num> poor houses in Round Court, Brook Hill, were partly carried away. From Acton Place, Bagnigge Wells Road, to King's Cross the roads were impassable, and the kitchens inundated.   <num value="1">One</num> baker alone lost <num value="36">thirty-six</num> sacks of flour. A few days after another storm produced a renewed flood, and <num value="2">two</num> more houses fell in Round Court, Brook Hill. The introduction of the cholera into Clerkenwell Prison, in <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>, was attributed to the effluvia of the river Fleet, then opened. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>, the Fleet, as <num value="1">one</num> of the metropolitan main sewers then vested in the Commissioners of Sewers, became vested in the newly-created Metropolitan Board of Works.   The gigantic maindrainage system began with the great subterranean roads, the high, the low, and the mid level, which, intercepting all lesser sewers, carry their united floods to Barking Creek and Crossness Point. The high level runs from Hampstead to Bow; the midlevel from Kensal Green to Bow; the low level, from Cremore to Abbey Mills on the marshes near Stratford. The mid-level main-drainage works were commenced in Clerkenwell in <datestruct VALUE="1863-03--"><month reg="03">March</month> <year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct>, in Wilderness Row.   From Goswell Street to Wilderness Row it was an open cutting, with the exception of a short tunnel under the Charterhouse grounds. The distance from Old Ford, Bow, to Kensal Green is <num value="9">9</num> miles <num value="2650">2,650</num> feet, exclusive of <num value="2.50">2 1/2</num> miles of junctions.   The sewer through   Clerkenwell is <num value="8">8</num> feet <num value="9">9</num> inches in diameter. There were generally <num value="400">400</num> or <num value="500">500</num> men at work, with <num value="11">eleven</num> steam-engines to pump water and draw earth. 
<P> <QUOTE>The Fleet Sewer,</QUOTE> says Mr. Pinks, <QUOTE>the  <Q> Cloaca Maxima</Q>  of our metropolis, receives the drainage of parts of Hampstead and Highgate, all Kentish Town, Camden Town, and Somers' Town, parts of Islington, Clerkenwell, and St. Sepulchre, and nearly all that part of the Holborn division of sewers south of the New Road, the total surface draining into it in the Holborn and Finsbury division being about <num value="4220">4,220</num> acres. In <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct> about <num value="400">400</num> acres of this district were covered with houses. At present there are nearly <num value="2000">2,000</num> acres built upon, of necessity requiring a sewer of large capacity to carry off the refuse waters.

<P>Fleet Bridge, Tuesday, <datestruct VALUE="1840-07-28"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1840>1840</year></datestruct>.-As I could not depend upon the admeasurements, which at the beginning of the year I had taken in a hurried manner at Fleet Bridges, while bricklayers were placing in a brick bottom   in place of the original <num value="1">one</num> of alluvial soil, I determined to obtain them the <num value="1">first</num> opportunity. This evening, therefore, at <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock, I met Bridgewater (<num value="1">one</num> of the workmen employed in constructing the new sewer from Holborn Bridge to Clerkenwell) by appointment at the hoard there. Water boots being in readiness, I lighted my lamps, and, assisted by the watchmen, King and Anon, we descended the ladder, and got into that branch of the sewer which joins Wren's Bridge at Holborn. We then walked carefully till we reached Fleet Bridge. I suspended my argand lamp on the breakwater of the sewer, and with my lanthorn light we proceeded towards the Thames.   We got a considerable distance, during which the channel of the sewer twice turned to the right at a slight angle. The last portion we entered into was barrelled at the bottom, and the middle so full of holes, and the water so deep as we approached the Thames, that we thought it prudent to return to Fleet Bridge. Here I lighted up <num value="4">four</num> candles, which, with my <num value="2">two</num> lamps, enabled me to see the admeasurements I required. Bridgewater, who is a sober, steady, and good-tempered man, was of great use to me in so doing.

No time was to be lost; but I had only <num value="1">one</num> more admeasurement to make, viz., the width of the North Bridge. I managed this, and we then snatched up the basket, and, holding our lamps aloft, dashed up the sewer which we had to get up <num value="1">one</num> half before out of danger. The air was close and made us faint. However, we got safe to Holborn Bridge with all our things, and the argand lamp did not blow out till we just reached it.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Mr. Archer, in his <title>Vestiges of Old London,</title>
 <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>, says that by the opening at the Thames <QUOTE>many persons enter at low tide, armed with sticks to defend themselves from rats, as well as for the purpose  <Q>of sounding on their perilous way</Q>  among the slimy shallows; and carrying a lanthern to light the dreary passage, they wander for miles under the crowded streets in search of such waifs as are carried there from above. A more dismal pursuit can scarcely be conceived; so near to the great concourse of London streets that the rolling of the numerous vehicles incessantly thundering overhead, and even the voices of wayfarers, are heard, where, here and there, a grating admits a glimmer of the light of day; yet so utterly cut off from all communion with the busy world above, so lonely in the very heart of the great and populous city, that of the thousands who pass along, not <num value="1">one</num> is even conscious of the proximity of the wretched wanderer creeping in noisome darkness and peril beneath his very feet. A   source of momentary destruction ever lurking in these gloomy regions exists in the gases, which generate in their confined and putrefying atmosphere, and sometimes explode with a force sufficient to dislodge the very masonry; or which, taking light from the contact of the lantern, might envelope the miserable intruder in sudden flame. Many venturers have been struck down in such a dismal pilgrimage, to be heard of no more; may have fallen suddenly choked, sunk bodily in the treacherous slime, become a prey to swarms of voracious rats, or have been overwhelmed by a sudden increase of the polluted stream.</QUOTE>

<P>Turnmill Street, pulled down in the Clerkenwell improvements of <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>-<num value="7">7</num>, was undoubtedly for several centuries <num value="1">one</num> of the most disreputable streets in all London.   It is mentioned as Trylmyl Streate as early as the reign of Henry IV. It is marked in Aggas's map, and is noticed in a letter from Recorder Fleetwood to Burleigh in <datestruct value="1585--"><year reg="1585">1585</year></datestruct> as a place for thieves' houses. The name was sometimes corrupted into Turnbull and Trunball Street. It seems to have been the very sink of the vice of London, and to have been frequented by highwaymen and rogues of every description.   It is mentioned as an infamous resort by some half-dozen of the Elizabethan dramatists, more especially   by   Beaumont and Fletcher, Lodowick Barry, Marston, Middleton, Ben Jonson, Randolph, Webster, &amp;c.   Nor must we forget that it was of his wild and youthful feats <pb id="P.425" n="425"> in Turnbull Street at Justice Shallow brags of to Falstaff.   Here, the Pistols and Bardolphs of the time swaggered and cheated, and here the Tybalts of the day occasionally received their quietus from a subtle thrust.

Once, with daring effrontery,  <Q>on the approach of evening (to quote the <title>Newgate Calendar</title>), he and his gang ventured towards London, and having got as far as Turnmill Street, the keeper of the Clerkenwell Bridewell happening to see Bunworth, called to him, and said he wanted to peak with him. Bunworth hesitated, but the other assuring him that he intended no injury, and the thief being confident that his associates would not desert him, swore he did not regard the keeper, whom he advanced to meet with a pistol in his hand, the other miscreants walking on the opposite side of the street, armed with cutlasses and pistols This singular spectacle attracted the attention of the populace. A considerable crowd soon gathered round them, on which Bunworth joined his companions, who thought their safest plan would be to retreat towards the fields; wherefore they kept together, and, facing the people, retired in a body, presenting their pistols, and swearing they would fire on any who should molest them.</Q>  
<P>This same Bunworth gave another proof of his audacity.   Sitting down at the door of a public-house in Holborn, where he was well known, he called for a pint of beer and drank it, holding a pistol in his hand by way of protection. He then went off with the greatest apparent unconcern.

Stow mentions it, in <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>, as near a timber bridge that crossed Turnmill Brook, (near the end of Field Lane).   In a flood in <datestruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>, when casks swam down the streets, several hogs were washed out of their sties in Castle Inn Yard, Smithfield, and were carried down to Chick Lane.

<NOTE RESP=B><P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.426.1">New Wright's Thieves' Supper</LEMMA></NOTE>
 was demolished, supposed to have been built about <num value="300">three hundred</num> years.   It was once known as the  <Q>Red Lion Tavern,</Q>  but for the century preceding its destruction it was used as a lodging-house, and was the resort of thieves, and the lowest grade of the frail sisterhood.   It was numbered <num value="3">3</num> in West Street, and was situate on the north-west side of the Fleet Ditch, a few houses from Saffron Hill, and at the eastern corner of Brewhouse Yard.   It was sometimes called Jonathan Wild's House, and  <Q>the Old House in West street.</Q>  From its remarkable adaptation as a hiding-place, with its various   means   of escape, it   was a curious   habitation. Its dark closets, trap-doors, sliding panels, and secret recesses rendered it <num value="1">one</num> of the most secure places for robbery and murder. It was here that a chimney-sweep named Jones, who escaped out of Newgate about <num value="3">three</num> years before the destruction of the house, was so securely hidden for about <num value="6">six</num> weeks, that, although it was repeatedly searched by the police, he was never discovered until his lair was divulged by <num value="1">one</num> of its inmates, who, by incautiously observing   that he knew      whereabouts Jones was concealed, was taken up and remanded from time to time as an accessory to his escape, but who, at last, tired of prison fare and prison discipline, pointed out the place to obtain his own liberty.   Jones was concealed by parting off a portion of a cellar with brickwork, well besmeared with soot and dirt, to prevent detection. This cell, or, more properly, den, was about <num value="4">four</num> feet wide, by <num value="9">nine</num> in depth; and during Jones's incarceration therein, he had food conveyed to him through a small aperture, by a brick or <num value="2">two</num> being left out next the rafters. It was here that a sailor was robbed, and afterwards flung naked through <num value="1">one</num> of the convenient apertures in the wall into the Fleet, for which crime <num value="2">two</num> men and a woman 
<FIGURE id="Fig.426" n="2000.07.0153"><HEAD>Old Newgate.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 were transported. A skull, and numerous human bones, were found in the cellars.   Numerous parties daily visited the premises, among whom were many of the police and county magistrates. It was said to have been the rendezvous, and often the hiding-place, of Jack Sheppard and Jerry Abershaw; and the place looked as if many a foul deed had been there planned and decided on, the sewer or ditch receiving and floating away anything thrown into it.   On <num value="1">one</num> occasion the police had surrounded the house to take a thief, whom they knew to be there, but he made his escape in their actual presence. At another time an officer went into <num value="1">one</num> of the rooms to apprehend a man, and saw   him   in   bed. While at   the door, calling to another to help him, he turned his head and saw the man   getting under the bed. He did not take any notice of it, but when the other man came up, on looking   under the bed, the man   had vanished. After some search   they   discovered   a   trap-door through which <num value="1">one</num> of them jumped, but he, breaking his leg in the fall, the fellow   escaped. In this house was a place where a gang of coiners carried on their trade, and had also a private still. This place, like all the rest, had a communication with the sewer. In <num value="1">one</num> of the garrets was a secret door, which led to the roof of the next house from which any offender could be in Saffron Hill in a few minutes.

<P>In <datestruct value="1244--"><year reg="1244">1244</year></datestruct> <num value="4">four</num> Grey Franciscan friars arrived in London from   Italy, and by the assistance of the <QUOTE>Preaching   Friars</QUOTE> of Holborn,   obtained     a temporary residence in Cornhill.      They   soon found     patrons,   John Ewin, a mercer, purchasing for them   a vacant spot of ground in the parish   of St. Nicholas Shambles (from   a fleshmarket     held     there), which he gave for the use of these friars; and William    Joyner, Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1239--"><year reg="1239">1239</year></datestruct> (Henry III.), built   the   choir. Henry   Wallis, a   succeeding   Lord   Mayor, added the body of the church.      A   new   and grander     church     was commenced     in <datestruct value="1306--"><year reg="1306">1306</year></datestruct> (Edward I.) at the joint        expense of Queen Margaret, <num value="2">second</num>   wife   of Edward   I.; John   of Brittany, Earl of Richmond; Gilbert de Clare, the Earl of Gloucester; and   other pious   and generous persons.   This   church, according to Stow, was consecrated in <datestruct value="1325--"><year reg="1325">1325</year></datestruct>, and is described as <num value="300">300</num>   feet long, <num value="89">89</num> feet broad, and   <num value="64">64</num> feet <num value="2">2</num> inches high. The chancel ceiling was painted, and the windows glowed with stained glass. 
<P>In   connection with this church the illustrious Richard Whittington founded a library, in <datestruct value="1429--"><year reg="1429">1429</year></datestruct>, and furnished it with desks and settles for students. It is especially noted that <num value="1">one</num> patient transcriber was paid <measure value="100bmark" type=currency><num value="100">100</num> marks</measure> for copying the works of Nicholas de Lira. 
<P>At the dissolution, Henry VIII., who tore all he could from piety and poverty, used the church as a warehouse for French plunder. In <datestruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct> the king gave the priory (church, library, chapter-house, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.427" n="2000.07.0154"><HEAD>King Charles's Porter And Dwarf. (From The Old Bas-Relief.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 and cloisters) to the Mayor and Corporation of London. The magnificent tyrant, at the same time, gave the City the Hospital of St. Bartholomew the Little, and the parish churches of St. Ewin in Newgate   Market and Nicholas   in   the Shambles, and directed that these <num value="2">two</num> parishes, a part of St. Sepulchre's parish, situated   within Newgate,   and   all the site of the late dissolved priory, should form <num value="1">one</num> parish, and   that the church   of the   priory should be   the   parish church, and be   called <QUOTE>Christ Church within Newgate, founded   by Henry VIII.</QUOTE> 
<P>The   church,   swept away in the fiery flood of   <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>,   was   rebuilt from   Wren's design, in <datestruct value="1687--"><year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct>, and   was   completed   in   the   <num value="2">second</num> year of Queen Anne.     The patronage of Christ Church is vested in the Mayor and Commonalty of London, as governors of St. Bartholomew's Hospital.     The parish of St. Leonard, Foster Lane, was united to that of Christ Church, and the Dean   and   Chapter of Westminster, patrons of St. Leonard's, therefore present alternately.   By the original grant of Henry   VIII. there <hi rend=italics>should</hi>
 be <num value="5">five</num>   assistant readers.      The   present Christ Church,. <num value="114">114</num> feet long and <num value="81">81</num> broad, is not more than half as large as the old church, the western plot of ground being turned into a burial-ground. The steeple is <num value="153">153</num> feet high.   The interior is generous and spacious, with a wagon-headed ceiling and <num value="12">twelve</num> clerestory windows, with the old pagan adornments of fat cherubims, tasteless scrolls, and coarse foliage. An ornamental band connects each <pb id="P.428" n="428"> Corinthian column. A great theatrical gallery at the west end, piled up with a huge organ, is set apart, together with the side galleries, for the Bluecoat boys.   The pulpit has carved panels representing, after a fashion, the <num value="4">four</num> Evangelists and the Last Supper.   The marble font is carved with fruit, flowers, and cherubims. The church was repaired, and what churchwardens are pleased to call beautified, in <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, and again in <datestruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></datestruct>.   The old burial fees in the happily bygone days of intramural interments were high enough at this church -<measure value="2l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2">2</num></measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> for an inhabitant in the chancel; <num value="5">5</num> for a stranger. While the lucky inhabitant paid <measure value="12l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="12">12</num></measure> <measure value="12s." type=currency><num value="12">12</num>s.</measure> for his tombstone, the poor stranger's friends had to lay down <measure value="21l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="21">21</num></measure> for his. 
<P>On the north wall at the east end of the church is a brass tablet to the memory of Dame Mary Ramsey, who died in <datestruct value="1596--"><year reg="1596">1596</year></datestruct>, and who established a free writing-school in Christ's Hospital.   Here, where queens have rested and murderers mouldered, lies   the great Nonconformist minister, Richard Baxter, on whose tomb no more fitting epitaph could be placed than the title of his own book, 
<title>The   Saint's Rest.</title>     This   excellent man, of Shropshire birth, in the earlier part of his life became master of a free-school at Dudley.   In <datestruct value="1638--"><year reg="1638">1638</year></datestruct> he took orders, having then no scruples about conformity, but soon after, some Nonconformist friends began to slowly influence his mind.   He then began to distrust the surplice, objected to the cross in   baptism, and found flaws in the Prayer Book and the Liturgy. In <datestruct value="1640--"><year reg="1640">1640</year></datestruct> he was minister at Kidderminster; but when the civil wars broke out, and after Naseby, he became chaplain to Colonel Whalley's Puritan regiment, and was present at several sieges. The Cavaliers said he killed <num value="1">one</num> of their party and stole his medal, a story which Baxter publicly denied. On his preaching against Cromwell he was sent for to Court, and told of the great things God ha done for the Parliament.   Baxter replied that the honest people of the land took their ancient monarchy to be a blessing, and not an evil, and humbly craved Cromwell's patience, that he might ask him how they had forfeited that blessing, and to whom that forfeiture was made. Cromwell replied, angrily, <QUOTE>There   was no forfeiture; but God had changed it as pleased Him.</QUOTE> A few days after, Cromwell sent to   ask Baxter for his opinion on liberty of conscience, which Baxter gave him. On Charles's restoration, Baxter, who was a sect in himself was appointed <num value="1">one</num> of the king's chaplains, and was frequently with the godless monarch.   He assisted as a commissioner at the Savoy Conference, and drew up a reformed liturgy.       Lord   <title>Clarendon</title>
 offered this crochety but honest theologian the bishopric of Hereford, but he declined the appointment, and went on preaching about London. For illegal preaching he was sent to gaol for <num value="6">six</num> months, but eventually discharged before the expiration of that period.   After the indulgence in <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct> he preached at Pinner's Hall, in Fetter Lane, in St. James's Market House, at a chapel he built himself in Oxenden Street, and in Southwark. In <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct> Baxter was taken before Lord Chief Justice Jefferies, for remarks on James II. in his <title>New Testament Paraphrase,</title> and sent to prison, after much vulgar abuse from Jefferies, for <num value="2">two</num> years, but in <datestruct value="1686--"><year reg="1686">1686</year></datestruct> he was pardoned by King James.   At Baxter's last disgraceful trial, that cruel bully, the Lord Chief Justice, told him that Oates was then standing in the pillory in New Palace Yard, and that if he. (Baxter) was on the other side of the pillory at the same time, he (Jefferies) would say that <num value="2">two</num> of the greatest rogues and rascals in the kingdom stood there. Like an avalanche of mud the foul words poured forth from this unjust judge. <QUOTE>Ay,</QUOTE> said <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.428.1">Jefferies</LEMMA>, <QUOTE>this is your Presbyterian cant; truly called to be bishops; that is, himself and such rascals, called to be bishops of Kidderminster, and other such places; bishops set apart by such factious, snivelling Presbyterians as himself; a Kidderminster bishop, he means. According to the saying of a late learned author, every parish shall maintain a tithe-pig metropolitan.</QUOTE> Mr. Baxter beginning to speak again, says he to him, <QUOTE>Richard, Richard, dost thou think we will hear thee poison the court, &amp;c.? Richard, thou art an old fellow--an old knave; thou hast written books enough to load a cart, every <num value="1">one</num> as full of sedition (I might say, treason) as an egg is full of meat. Hadst thou been whipped out of thy writing-trade <num value="40">forty</num> years ago it had been happy.   Thou pretendest to be a preacher of the. gospel of peace, and thou hast <num value="1">one</num> foot in the grave; &lsquo;tis time for thee to begin to think what account thou intendest to give. But leave thee to thyself, and I see thoul't go on as thou hast begun; but, by the grace of God, I will look after thee. I know thou hast a mighty party, and I see a great many of the brotherhood in corners, waiting to see what will become of their mighty don,  and a   doctor of the party (looking to Dr. Bates) at your elbow; but, by the grace of Almighty God, I'll crush you all.</QUOTE> 
<P>After this Baxter retired to a house in Charterhouse Yard, where he assisted a Mr. Sylvester every Sunday morning, and preached a lecture every Thursday.   He died in the year <datestruct value="1691"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>. Baxter is said to have written more than <num value="145">145</num> distinct treatises.

<P>On the east wall is a tablet to the memory of Dr. Trapp, who was vicar of the united parishes of Christ Church and   St. Leonard, Foster Lane, for <num value="26">twenty-six</num> years, and died in <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct>.      This learned   translator   and   controversialist lived   in Warwick Lane.   Near the communion-table is a large monument to Sir John Bosworth, Chamberlain of the City, who died in <datestruct value="1749--"><year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>, and his wife, Dame Hester Bosworth; and also a plain tablet to Mr. John Stock, many years a painter at the Royal Dockyard, and who died in <datestruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct>.   He left <measure value="13700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="13700">13,700</num></measure> for charitable and philanthropic purposes. A   marble monument, with a bust, records the   Rev. Samuel Crowther, nearly <num value="30">thirty</num> years incumbent of this church.   He was a grandson of Richardson, the novelist, and was born in New      Boswell Court. He was struck down with apoplexy while reading morning prayers.   The inscription to his memory runs thus :-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote>This monument is raised by his grateful parishoners and friends to the memory of the Reverend Samuel Crowther, M.A., formerly fellow of New   College, Oxford, and nearly <num value="30">thirty</num> years minister of these united parishes.   He   was born   <datestruct VALUE="1769-01-9"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=9>9</day>, <year reg=1769>1769</year></datestruct>,   and died <datestruct VALUE="1829-09-28"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1829>1829</year></datestruct>. Gifted with many excellent endowments, he was enabled by grace to consecrate all to the service of his Divine Master. The zeal, perseverance, and fidelity with which, under much bodily infirmity, he laboured in this place till his last illness (borne nearly <num value="5">five</num> years with exemplary resignation), his humble, disinterested, and catholic spirit, his suavity of manners, and sanctity of life, manifested a self-devotion to the cause of Christ, and the best interests of mankind, never to be forgotten by his flock; to whom he endeared himself, not more in the able discharge of his public duties than in his assiduous and affectionate ministrations, as their private counsellor, comforter and friend; and among whom the young, the poor, and the afflicted were the especial objects of his solicitude.   To the excellence of that gospel which he preached with a simple and persuasive eloquence, that gained every ear, his life has left a testimony, sealed in death, by which he yet speaks.</QUOTE>

<P>The steeple of Christ Church is thought by many very pleasing. <QUOTE>It rises,</QUOTE> says Mr. Godwin, who in some respects condemns it, <QUOTE>as all Wren's towers <hi rend=italics>do</hi>   rise, and as all towers   should <hi rend=italics>rise,</hi>
 directly   from   the ground, giving   to the mind of the   beholder that assurance   of stability which under other circumstances is wanting.</QUOTE> There are small Grecian columns   on each storey of the tower, and an elliptical pediment.    The vases on the top of the peristyle were taken down some years ago.   The basement storey of <hi rend=italics>the tower</hi> is open on <num value="3">three</num> sides, and forms a porch to the east chancel. The east end, which faces King Edward Street, is disfigured by <num value="2">two</num> enormous buttresses. In a vault, discovered in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, near the church, is the well-preserved body of a man, supposed to be that of some Newgate malefactor. 
<P>The Spital sermons, says Mr. Trollope in <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, in his book on Christ's Hospital, originated in   an old   custom, by which some learned person was appointed   yearly by the Bishop of London to preach at St. Paul's Cross, on Good Friday, on the subject of <QUOTE>Christ's Passion.</QUOTE> On the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday following <num value="3">three</num> other divines were appointed to uphold the   doctrine of <QUOTE>The Resurrection,</QUOTE> at the pulpit-cross in the Spital (Spitalfields).   On the Sunday following, a <num value="5">fifth</num> preached at Paul's Cross, and passed judgment upon the merits   of those who had preceded him. At these sermons the Lord Mayor and aldermen attended, ladies also, on   the   Monday, forming part of the procession; and, at the close of each day's solemnity, his lordship and the sheriffs gave a private dinner to such of their friends amongst the aldermen as attended the sermon. From this practice the civic festivities at Easter were at length extended to a   magnificent scale.   The children of Christ's Hospital took part in the above solemnities, so that, in <datestruct value="1594--"><year reg="1594">1594</year></datestruct>, When it became necessary to rebuild the pulpit-cross at the Spital, a gallery was erected also for their accommodation.   In the great Rebellion the pulpit was destroyed, and the sermons were discontinued till the Restoration, after which the <hi rend=italics><num value="3">three</num></hi> Spital sermons, as they were still called, were revived at St. Bride's Church, <pb id="P.430" n="430"> Fleet Street. They have since been reduced to <num value="2">two</num>, and, from <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>, have been delivered at Christ Church, Newgate Street. 
<P>It was on their <num value="1">first</num> appearance at the Spital that the children of Christ's Hospital wore the blue costume by which they have since been distinguished. <QUOTE>Instead of the subjects,</QUOTE> continues Mr. Trollope, <QUOTE>which were wont to be discussed from the pulpit-cross of St Mary Spital, discourses are now delivered commemorative of the objects of the <num value="5">five</num> sister hospitals; and a report is read of the number of children maintained and educated, and of sick, disorderly, and lunatic persons for whom provision is made in each respectively. On each day the boys of Christ's Hospital, with the legend  <Q> He is risen</Q>  attached to their left shoulders, form part of the civic procession, walking, on the <num value="1">first</num> day, in the order of their schools, the king's boys bearing their nautical instruments, and, on the <num value="2">second</num>, according to their several wards, headed by their nurses.</QUOTE> 
<P>A curious old bas-relief, says Mr. Cunningham (writing in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>), not ill-cut, over the entrance to Bull's Head Court, preserves the memory of a small giant and a very great dwarf.   The quaint effigies of the disproportioned couple represent William Evans, an enormous Welsh porter, at Whitehall, in the service of Charles I., and <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.430.1">Sir Geoffrey, or Jeffrey Hudson</LEMMA>, the vain but gallant dwarf immortalised by Scott, in <title>Peveril of the Peak.</title>
 This bas-relief, Walpole thinks, was probably a shop-sign.   Evans, a mammoth-like man, stood <num value="7">seven</num> feet <num value="6">six</num> inches high, while his choleric companion was only <num value="3">three</num> feet <num value="9">nine</num> inches. At a court masque at Whitehall, the porter drew Sir Jeffrey out of his pocket, to the amazement and amusement of all the ladies of that not too respectable court. 
<P> <QUOTE>Hudson's <num value="1">first</num> appearance at Court,</QUOTE> says Sir Walter, in a note to <title>Peveril of the Peak,</title> <QUOTE>was his being presented, as mentioned in the text, in a pie, at an entertainment given by the Duke of Buckingham to Charles I. and Henrietta Maria. Upon the same occasion the duke presented the tenant of the pasty to the queen, who retained, him as her page. When about <num value="8">eight</num> years of age, he was but eighteen or <num value="20">twenty</num> inches high, and he remained stationary at that stature till he was <num value="30">thirty</num> years old, when he grew to the height of <num value="3">three</num> feet <num value="9">nine</num> inches, and there stopped.</QUOTE> Being teased by a young gallant, named Crofts, who threatened to drown him with a syringe, Hudson called out his antagonist at Calais, and killed him with his <num value="1">first</num> shot.

Sir William Davenant makes a real or supposed combat between the dwarf and a turkey-cock the subject of a poem called  <Q>Jeffreidos.</Q>  The scene is laid at Dunkirk, where, as the satire concludes-

<P>In <datestruct value="1644--"><year reg="1644">1644</year></datestruct> the dwarf attended his royal mistress to France. The Restoration recalled him, with other royalists, to England. But this poor being, who received, it would seem, hard measure both from nature and fortune, was not doomed to close his days in peace. Poor Jeffrey, upon some suspicion respecting the Popish Plot, was taken up in <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct>, and confined in the Gatehouse Prison, Westminster, where he ended his life, in the <num value="63">sixty-third</num> year of his age.

<P>In Warwick Lane, south side of Newgate Street, a College of Physicians was built by Wren, when the Great Fire had destroyed their house at Amen Corner, where Harvey had lectured on his great discovery of the circulation of the blood.

<P>The amphitheatre, afterwards degraded into a meat-market, is   praised   by Elmes for its convenient arrangement and its acoustic qualities.   Nor could even the modern Goth despise the fine lofty hall, the magnificent staircase, the stucco-garlands of the dining-room, and the carved oak chimney-piece and gallery. On the north and south were the residences of the college officers, on the west the principal front, <num value="2">two</num>-storeyed, the lower Ionic, the upper Corinthian.   On the east was the octagon, with the gilt ball above, and below a statue of Sir John Cutler. 
<P>About this same Cutler an odd story is told, which is well worth repeating. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct> (Charles II.) Sir John Cutler, a rich City man, and a notorious miser, related to Dr. Whistler, the president of the college, expressed a generous wish to contribute largely to the rebuilding of the house, and a committee was actually appointed to thank him for his kind intentions.   Cutler gravely accepted the thanks, renewed his promises, and mentioned the parts of the building for which he intended to pay. In <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct> the college, grateful for favours yet to come, voted statues to the king and Cutler, and <num value="9">nine</num> years afterwards borrowed money of Sir John, to discharge some builder's debts, the college being now completed.   This loan seems to have in some way changed Cutler's intentions, for in <datestruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct> his executors brought a demand on the college for   <measure value="7000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="7000">7,000</num></measure>, including the promised sum which had never been given, but had been set down as a debt. The indignant college threw down   <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>, which the imperturbable executors took as payment in full. The college at once erased the grateful inscription- 
<QUOTE lang=la REND=blockquote>Omnis Cutleri cedit labor Amphitheatro,</QUOTE>
 which they had engraved on the pedestal of the miser's statue, and would no doubt have ground the statue down to powder, had they not been ashamed.

<P>Cutler is ridiculed by Arbuthnot, in his <title>Scriblerus,</title> where, in ridicule of <num value="1">one</num> of Locke's philosophic opinions,   he describes a pair of Cutler's cottons, which were darned so often by his maid, that they at last became silk.

<P>Some anecdotes of th old physicians who have paced up and down Warwick Lane seem almost indispensable to a sketch, however brief, of the old College of Physicians.   No can   we begin   better than with the famous Dr. Radcliffe, the <num value="1">first</num> preeminent physician that arose after the removal of the college to the building erected by Wren in Warwick Lane. Radcliffe, a man eager for money, and of rough Abernethy manners, had the cream of all the London practice, when he lived in Bow Street, next door to Sir Godfrey Kneller, the great painter.   He was brusque even with kings. When called in to see King William, at Kensington, finding his legs dropsically swollen,   he frankly said, <QUOTE>I would not have your <num value="2">two</num> legs, your Majesty, not for your <num value="3">three</num>   kingdoms;</QUOTE> and on   another visit the Jacobite doctor boldly told the little Dutch hero- <QUOTE>Your juices are all vitiated, your whole mass of blood corrupted, and the nutriment for the most part turned to water; but,</QUOTE> added the doctor, <QUOTE>if your   Majesty will forbear making long visits to the Earl of Bradford</QUOTE> (where, to tell the truth, the king was wont to drink very hard), <QUOTE>I'll engage to make you live <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> years longer, but beyond that time no physic can protract your Majesty's existence.</QUOTE> 
<P>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, when Radcliffe was sent for from the tavern (for he did not dislike wine) by <pb id="P.432" n="432"> Queen Anne, he flatly refused to leave his bottle and the company. <QUOTE>Tell her Royal Highness,</QUOTE> he bellowed, <QUOTE>that it's nothing but the vapours. She is as well as any woman breathing, only she won't believe it.</QUOTE> With a fantastic wit worthy of Sydney Smith himself, he told a hypochondriacal lady who consulted him about a nervous singing in the head, to <QUOTE>curl her hair with a ballad;</QUOTE> and in his vexation at the fancies of female patients, he anticipated female doctors, by proposing an Act of Parliament to entitle nurses alone to attend women. 
<P> <QUOTE>Dr. Radcliffe was once sent for,</QUOTE> says the author of <title>The Gold-headed Cane,</title> <QUOTE>into the country, to visit a gentleman ill of a quinsy. Finding that no external or internal application would be of service, he desired the lady of the house to order a hasty-pudding to be made. When it was done, his own servants were to bring it up; and while the pudding was preparing, he gave them his private instructions. In a short time it was set on the table, and in full view of the patient.  <Q>Come, Jack and Dick,</Q>  said Radcliffe,  <Q>eat as quickly as possible; you have had no breakfast this morning.</Q>  Both began with their spoons; but on Jack's dipping once only for Dick's twice, a quarrel arose. 
<FIGURE id="Fig.432" n="2000.07.0155"><HEAD>College Of Physicians, Warwick Lane. Interior Of The Quadrangle.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 Spoonfuls of hot pudding were discharged on both sides, and at last handfuls were pelted at each other. The patient was seized with a hearty fit of laughter, the quinsy burst, and discharged its contents, and my master soon completed the cure.</QUOTE> 
<P>Steele, in the <title>Tatler</title>, ridiculed the old doctor's love-making. Dr. Radcliffe was unlucky enough to be accused by the Whigs of killing Queen Mary, and by the Tories of causing the death of Queen Anne, by refusing to attend her in her last illness. He was himself dying at the time, and was unable to attend; but the clamour of the mob was so loud, accompanied even by threats of assassination, that they are said to have hastened the great physician's death, which took place just <num value="3">three</num> months after the queen died. 
<P>Dr. Mead, the physician of George II., was, unlike Radcliffe, a polished and learned man, who succeeded to much of his predecessor's business, and occupied his old house in Bloomsbury Square. He was the <num value="1">first</num> doctor to encourage inoculation for the small-pox, and practised the Oriental system on <num value="6">six</num> condemned criminals, with the consent of George I. He attended Pope, Sir Isaac Newton, and Bishop Burnet in their last illnesses. Mead is <pb id="P.433" n="433"> said to have gained nearly <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure> a year yet was so hospitable, that he did not leave more than <measure value="50000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure>. When not at his house in Great Ormond Street, Mead usually spent his evenings at <QUOTE>Batson's</QUOTE> Coffee House, and in the afternoon his apothecaries used to meet him at <QUOTE>Toms',</QUOTE> near Covent Garden, with written or verbal reports of cases for which he prescribed without seeing the patient, and took half-guinea fees.   He died in <datestruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>, and was buried in the Temple. As an instance of Mead's generosity the following story is told:--In <datestruct value="1723--"><year reg="1723">1723</year></datestruct>, when the celebrated Dr. Friend, a friend of Atterbury, was sent to the Tower, Mead kindly took his practice, and on his release by Sir Robert Walpole, presented the escaped Jacobite with the result, <num value="5000">5,000</num> guineas. 
<FIGURE id="Fig.433" n="2000.07.0156"><HEAD>Cock Lane.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
<P>Dr. Askew, another of the great physicians of the Georgian era, lived in Queen Square, where he crammed his house with books, and entertained such men as Archbishop Markham, Sir William Jones, Dr. Farmer, <QUOTE>Demosthenes</QUOTE> Taylor, Dr. Parr, and Hogarth. The sale of Dr. Askew's library, in York Street, Covent Garden (<datestruct value="1755--"><year reg="1755">1755</year></datestruct>), occupied <num value="20">twenty</num> days. 
<P>Dr. William Pitcairn, who resided in Warwick Court, Warwick Lane, was for several years president of the college. <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.434.1">Dr. Baillie</LEMMA>, another eminent physician here, was a nephew of the great John Hunter. Sir Hans Sloane was elected President of the College of Physicians in <datestruct value="1719--"><year reg="1719">1719</year></datestruct>. He was an Irishman by birth, and a Scotchman by descent, and had accompanied the Duke of Albemarle to <pb id="P.434" n="434"> Jamaica as his physician. In <datestruct value="1727--"><year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct> he was created President of the Royal Society, on the death of Sir Isaac Newton, and became physician to George II. On his death, in <datestruct value="1753--"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct>, his museum and library were purchased by the nation, and became the nucleus of the British Museum. 
<P>In this brief notice of early physicians we must not forget to include that very <num value="2">second</num>-rate poet, Sir Richard Blackmore, son of a Wiltshire attorney. No poor poet was ever so ridiculed as this great man of Saddlers' Hall. Dryden and Pope both set him up in their Parnassian pillory; and of him Swift wrote- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Sternhold himself he out-Sternholded.</QUOTE>
 Dryden called him-

 In spite of this endless abuse of a well-meaning man, William III. knighted him, and Addison pronounced his ambitious poem, <title>The Creation,</title>

<P>Among the eccentric physicians who have paced up and down Warwick Lane, and passed across the shadow of the Golden Pill, was <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.434.2">Monsey</LEMMA>, a friend of Garrick, and physician to Chelsea College. Of this rough old cynic Mr. J. C. Jeaffreson, in his <title>Book about Doctors,</title> tells the following capital stories:-- 
<P> <QUOTE>Amongst the vagaries of this eccentric physician,</QUOTE> says Mr. Jeaffreson, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>was the way in which he extracted his own teeth.   Round the tooth sentenced to be drawn he fastened securely a strong piece of catgut, to the opposite side of which he affixed a bullet. With this bullet, and a full measure of powder, a pistol was charged. On the trigger being pulled, the operation was performed effectually and speedily. The doctor could only rarely prevail upon his friends to permit him to remove their teeth by this original process.   Once a gentleman who had agreed to try the novelty, and had even allowed the apparatus to be adjusted, at the last moment exclaimed,  <Q>Stop, stop, I have changed my mind</Q>   <Q> But I haven't, and you're a fool and a coward for your pains,</Q>  answered the doctor, pulling the trigger. In another instant, the tooth was extracted, much to the timid patient's delight and astonishment. 
<P>Before setting out, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, for a journey to Norfolk, incredulous with regard to cash-boxes and bureaus, he hid a considerable quantity of gold and notes in the fireplace of his study, covering them up artistically with cinders and shavings. A month afterwards, returning (luckily a few days before he was expected), he found his old housemaid preparing to entertain a few friends at tea in her master's room. The hospitable domestic was on the point of lighting the fire, and had just applied a candle to the doctor's notes, when he entered the room, seized on a pail of water that chanced to be standing near, and, throwing its contents over the fuel and the old woman, extinguished the fire and her presence of mind at the same time.   Some of the notes, as it was, were injured, and the Bank of England made objections to cashing them.</QUOTE>

Of the last-mentioned, Washington Irving has given an admirable picture in his  <Q>Sketch Book;</Q>  but as he has not given a portrait of the last resident bookseller of eminence in that ancient mart of bibliopolists, he has left us the pleasing task of performing an humble attempt in that way; but even we, who knew the character, are almost spared the trouble; for, could the old literary frequenters of Batson's and Will's Coffee-houses again appear in human shapes, with their large, wiry, white, curled wigs, coats without a collar, raised hair buttons, square pendicular cut in front, with immense long hanging sleeves, covering a delicate hand, further graced by fine ruffles; a long waistcoat, with angled-off flaps, descending to the centre of the thigh; the small-clothes slashed in front, and closed with <num value="3">three</num> small buttons;. with accurate and mathematically cut, square-toed, shortquartered shoes, with a large tongue, to prevent a small-sized square silver buckle hurting the instep, or soiling the fine silken hose, they would present an exact and faithful portrait of the late Edward Ballard standing at his shop, at the  <Q> Globe,</Q>  over against the pump, in Little Britain.

The writer of this article recollects, when a boy, frequently calling at his shop, and purchasing various books, in a new and unbound state, when they were considered to be out of print, and some of them really scarce. This arose from the <hi rend=italics>obscurity</hi> of the once celebrated Little Britain, and the great age of its last resident bookseller, who to the last retained some shares and copyrights (notwithstanding he and his brother had sold the most valuable to Lintot), in school and religious books; with the last remains of a stock, principally guarded and watched by an old faithful female servant.</QUOTE>

<P>Cock Lane, an obscure turning between Newgate Street and West Smithfield, was, in <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, the scene of a great imposture.   The ghost supposed to have been heard rapping there, in reply to questions, singularly resembled the familiar spirits of our modern mediums. The affair commenced in <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, by Parsons, the officiating clerk of St. Sepulchre's, observing, at early prayer, a genteel <pb id="P.436" n="436"> couple standing in the aisle, and ordering them into a pew. On the service ending, the gentleman stopped to thank Parsons, and to ask him if he knew of a lodging in the neighbourhood. Parsons at once offered rooms in his own house, in Cock Lane, and they were accepted. The gentleman proved to be a widower of family from Norfolk, and the lady the sister of his deceased wife, with whom he privately lived, unable, from the severity of the cruel old canon law, to marry her, as they both wished. In his absence in the country, the lady, who went by the name of Miss Fanny, had Parson's daughter, a little artful girl about <num value="11">eleven</num> years of age, to sleep with her. In the night the lady and the child were disturbed by extraordinary noises, which were at <num value="1">first</num> attributed to a neighbouring shoemaker. Neighbours were called in to hear the sounds, which continued till the gentleman and lady removed to Clerkenwell, where the lady soon after died of small-pox. In January of the next year, according to Parsons, who, from a spirit of revenge against his late lodger, organised the whole fraud, the spiritualistic knockings and scratchings re-commenced. The child, from under whose bedstead these supposed supernatural sounds emanated, pretended to have fits, and Parsons began to interrogate the ghost, and was answered with affirmative and negative knocks. The ghost, under cross-examination, declared that it was the deceased lady lodger, who, according to Parsons, had been poisoned by a glass of purl, which had contained arsenic. Thousands of persons, of all ranks and stations, now crowded to Cock Lane, to hear the ghost, and the most ludicrous scenes took place with these poor gulls. 
<P>Even Horace Walpole was magnetically drawn to the clerk's house in Cock Lane. The clever fribble writes to Sir Horace Mann, <datestruct VALUE="1762-01-29"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=29>29</day>, <year reg=1762>1762</year></datestruct>: <QUOTE>I am ashamed to tell you that we are again dipped into an egregious scene of folly. <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.436.1">The reigning fashion is a ghost</LEMMA>-a ghost, that would not pass muster in the paltriest convent in the Apennines. It only knocks and scratches; does not pretend to appear or to speak. The clergy give it their benediction; and all the world, whether believers or infidels, go to hear it. I, in which number you may guess, go to-morrow; for it is as much the mode to visit the ghost as the Prince of Mecklenburg, who is just arrived. I have not seen him yet, though I have left my name for him.</QUOTE> 
<P>Again Walpole writes:-- <QUOTE>I went to hear it, for it is not an apparition, but an audition. We set out from the opera, changed our clothes at Northumberland House, the Duke of York, Lady Northumberland, Lady Mary Coke, Lord Hertford, and I, all in <num value="1">one</num> hackney-coach, and drove to the spot. It rained torrents; yet the lane was full of mob, and the house so full we could not get in. At last they discovered it was the Duke of York, and the company squeezed themselves into <num value="1">one</num> another's pockets to make room for us.   The house, which is borrowed, and to which the ghost has adjourned, is wretchedly small and miserable.   When we opened the chamber, in which were <num value="50">fifty</num> people, with no light, but <num value="1">one</num> tallow candle at the end, we tumbled over the bed of the child to whom the ghost comes, and whom they are murdering by inches in such insufferable heat and stench.   At the top of the room are ropes to dry clothes.   I asked if we were to have rope-dancing between the acts. We heard nothing. They told us (as they would at a puppet-show) that it would not come that night till <num value="7">seven</num> in the morning, that is, when there are only &lsquo;prentices and old women. We stayed, however, till half an hour after <num value="1">one</num>. The Methodists have promised them contributions.

<P>Of the descent into the vaults of St. John's, Clerkenwell, to hear the spirits rap on her coffinlid, Johnson, who was present, writes :-- <QUOTE>About <num value="10">ten</num> at night the gentlemen met in the chamber in which the girl, supposed to be disturbed by a spirit, had with proper caution been put to bed by several ladies. They sat rather more than an hour, and hearing nothing, went down-stairs, where they interrogated the father of the girl, who denied in the strongest terms any knowledge or belief of fraud. While they were inquiring and deliberating, they were summoned into the girl's chamber by some ladies who were near her bed, and who had heard knocks and scratches. When the gentlemen entered, the girl declared that she felt the spirit like a mouse upon her back, when the spirit was very solemnly required to manifest its existence by appearance, by impression on the hand or body of any present, or any other agency; but no evidence of any preternatural power was exhibited. The spirit was then very seriously advertised that the person to whom   the promise was made of striking the coffin was then about to visit the vault, and that the performance of the promise was then claimed. The company at <num value="1">one</num> o'clock went into the church, and the gentleman to whom the promise was made, went with another into the vault. The spirit was solemnly required to perform its promise, but nothing more than silence ensued.   The person   supposed to be accused by the spirit then went down with several <pb id="P.437" n="437"> others, but no effect was perceived.   Upon their return, they examined the girl, but could draw no confession from her.   Between <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="3">three</num> she desired and was permitted to go home with her father.   It is therefore the opinion of the whole assembly, that the child has some art of making or counterfeiting a particular noise, and that there is no agency of any higher cause.</QUOTE> 
<P>In the following account of a Cock Lane <hi rend=italics>seance,</hi>
 a pamphleteer of the time says:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>To have a proper idea of this scene, as it is now carried on, the reader is to conceive a very small room, with a bed in the middle; the girl at the usual hour of going to bed, is undressed, and put in with proper solemnity. The spectators are next introduced, who sit looking at each other, suppressing laughter, and wait in silent expectation for the opening of the scene. As the ghost is a good deal offended at incredulity, the persons present are to conceal theirs, if they have any, as by this concealment they can only hope to gratify their curiosity; for, if they show, either before or when the knocking is begun, a too prying, inquisitive, or ludicrous turn of thinking, the ghost continues usually silent, or, to use the expression of the house,  <Q>Miss Fanny is angry.</Q>  The spectators, therefore, have nothing for it but to sit quiet and credulous, otherwise they must hear no ghost, which is no small disappointment to persons who have come for no other purpose. 
<P>The girl, who knows, by some secret, when the ghost is to appear, sometimes apprizes the assistants of its intended visitation. It <num value="1">first</num> begins to scratch, and then to answer questions, giving <num value="2">two</num> knocks for a negative, but <num value="1">one</num> for an affirmative. By this means it tells whether a watch, when held up, be white, blue, yellow, or black; how many clergymen are in the room, though in this sometimes mistaken. It evidently distinguishes white men from negroes, with similar other marks of sagacity. However, it is sometimes mistaken in questions of a private nature, when it deigns to answer them. For instance, the ghost was ignorant where she had dined upon Mr. K--&lsquo;s marriage; how many of her relations were at church upon the same occasion; but, particularly, she called her father John, instead of Thomas--a mistake, indeed, a little extraordinary in a ghost. But perhaps she was willing to verify the old proverb, that  <Q> It is a wise child that knows its own father.</Q>  However, though sometimes right, and sometimes wrong, she pretty invariably persists in <num value="1">one</num> story, namely, that she was poisoned, in a cup of purl, by red arsenic, a poison unheard of before, by Mr. K--, in her last illness, and that she heartily wishes him hanged. 
<P>It is no easy matter to remark upon an evidence of this nature; but it may not be unnecessary to observe, that the ghost, though fond of company, is particularly modest upon these occasions, an enemy to the light of a candle, and always most silent before those from whose rank and understanding she could most reasonably expect redress. 
<P>This knocking and scratching was generally heard in a little room in which Mr. P----&lsquo;s <num value="2">two</num> children lay, the eldest of which was a girl about <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="13">thirteen</num> years old. The purport of this knocking was not thoroughly conceived till the eldest child pretended to see the actual ghost of the deceased lady mentioned above. When she had seen the ghost, a weak, ignorant publican also, who lived in the neighbourhood, asserted that he had seen it too, and Mr. P--  himself (the gentleman whom Mr. K--  had disobliged by suing for money) also saw the ghost about the same time.   The girl saw it without hands, in a shroud; the other <num value="2">two</num> saw it with hands, all luminous and shining. There was <num value="1">one</num> unlucky circumstance, however, in the apparition. Though it appeared to <num value="3">three</num> several persons, and could knock, scratch, and flutter, yet its coming would have been to no manner of purpose had it not been kindly assisted by the persons thus haunted. It was impossible for a ghost that could not speak to make any, discovery; the people, therefore, to whom it appeared, kindly undertook to make the discovery themselves, and the ghost, by knocking, gave its assent to their method of wording the accusation.</QUOTE>
 
<P>The girl was at last, we are glad to say, detected. When the child was bound hand and foot in a hammock, the ghost, it was found, was always silent. <num value="1">One</num> morning, when the child had been threatened with Newgate if she did not arouse the ghost, she was found to have concealed a small board under her stays, on which she produced the supernatural sounds. The bubble then burst. 
<P>The gentleman accused, remarks Mr. Pinks; <QUOTE>thought proper to vindicate his character in a legal way. On the <datestruct value="07-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct> the father and mother of the child, <num value="1">one</num> Mary Frazer, who acted as interpreter of the noises, a clergyman, and a, tradesman, were tried at Guildhall, before Lord Mansfield, by a special jury, and convicted of conspiracy. Sentence was deferred for several months, in order to give the offenders an opportunity of making Mr.--some compensation in the meantime. Accordingly, the clergyman and tradesman gave him several <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure>, and were thereupon dismissed with a reprimand. Parsons was <pb id="P.438" n="438"> sentenced to be placed <num value="3">three</num> times in the pillory, at the end of Cock Lane, and then to be imprisoned for <num value="2">two</num> years in the King's Bench gaol. Strange to relate, the rabble, who usually assembled in large numbers to witness and to assist in carrying out the former part of such a sentence, were in this case moved with compassion for the victim of the strong arm of the law, and refrained from offering him, while thus exposed, any insult, either by word or deed, and a public subscription was afterwards raised for his benefit. Mrs. Parsons was sentenced to be imprisoned for <num value="1">one</num> year, and Mary Frazer for <num value="6">six</num> months, with hard labour.   Miss Parsons, the agent of the mysterious noise, and who doubtless acted under her father's instructions, was twice married, and died in <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.440.5">John Bunyan</LEMMA>, died, in <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>. This extraordinary genius was the son of a tinker, at Elstow, near Bedford, and grew up a wild, dissolute youth, but seems to have received early strong religious impressions. He served in the Parliamentary army at the siege of Leicester, and the death of a comrade who took his post as a sentry produced a deep effect on his thoughtful mind. On returning to Elstow, Bunyan married a pious young woman, who seems to have led him   to read and study religious books. At the age of <num value="25">twenty-five</num>, after great spiritual struggles, Bunyan was admitted into church-fellowship with the Baptists, and baptised, probably near midnight, in a small stream near Bedford Bridge. His spiritual struggles still continued, he believed himself rejected, and the day of grace past; then came even doubts of the being of a God, and of the authority of the Scriptures. A   terrible illness, threatening consumption, followed this mental struggle, but with health came the calm of a serene faith, and he entered the ministry. A great trouble followed, to further purify this great soul.   He lost his <num value="1">first</num> wife; but a <num value="2">second</num> wife proved equally good and faithful. It being a time of persecution, Bunyan was soon thrown into Bedford gaol, where he pined for <num value="12">twelve</num> long years.

<P>Bunyan was released in <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>, when <num value="471">471</num> Quakers and <num value="20">twenty</num> Baptists were also set free. He then obtained a licence to preach at a <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.440.6">chapel</LEMMA> in Bedford, and he also continued his trade as a brazier.

<P>In spite of his consistent zeal, Bunyan was denounced by his enemies as a wizard, a Jesuit, and a highwayman. His popularity among his own people was, however, very great.   When he preached in London some <num value="3000">3,000</num> people used to collect, so that he had almost to be pulled over their heads into the pulpit. His end was characteristic. He was returning home from a visit to Reading, where he had gone to reconcile an offended father to a prodigal son, when he was seized, at the house in Snow Hill, with a fatal fever.

<P>To Snow Hill also belongs an anecdote of Dobson, <num value="1">one</num> of the most eminent of our early painters. Dobson, son of the master in the Alienation Office, was compelled by his father's extravagance to become an apprentice to a stationer and picturedealer. He soon began to excel in copying Titian and Vandyke, and exhibited his copies in a window in Snow Hill. Vandyke himself, who lived in Blackfriars, not far off, passing <num value="1">one</num> day, was so struck with Dobson's work, that he went in and inquired for the author. He found him at work in a poor garret, from which he soon rescued him. He shortly afterwards recommended him to King Charles, who took him into his service, and sat to him often for his portrait, and gave him the name of the English Tintoret. Dobson's style is dignified and thoughtful, and his colour delightful in tone. <num value="1">One</num> of his finest portrait groups is at Northumberland House, and in the <title>Decollation of St. John,</title> in the fine collection at Wilton House, he is said to have introduced a portrait of Prince Rupert. The Civil Wars, and the indifference which the Puritans manifested to art, no doubt reduced Dobson to poverty, and he died poor and neglected, in St. Martin's Lane, in <datestruct value="1646--"><year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct>.

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 

 
<P>Newgate, which Stow classifies as the <num value="5">fifth</num> principal gate in the City wall, was <num value="1">first</num> built about the reign of Henry I. or Stephen, and was a prison for felons and trespassers at least as early as the reign of King John.   It was erected when, St. Paul's being rebuilt, the old wards, from   Aldgate to Ludgate, were stopped up by enclosures and building materials, and people had to work round deviously by Paternoster Row and the old Exchange to get to Ludgate. 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1218"><year reg="1218">1218</year></datestruct> the king wrote to the Sheriffs of London, <QUOTE>commanding them   to repair the gaol at Newgate, for the safe keeping of his prisoners, promising that the charges laid out should be allowed them upon their accompt in the Exchequer</QUOTE> (Stow). In <datestruct value="1241--"><year reg="1241">1241</year></datestruct> some rich Jews (accused of imaginary crimes) were ordered to pay <measure value="20000bmark" type=currency><num value="20000">20,000</num> marks</measure>, or be kept perpetual prisoners at Newgate and other prisons. In this same reign Henry sent the sheriffs to the Tower, and fined the City <measure value="3000bmark" type=currency><num value="3000">3,000</num> marks</measure>, for allowing a convicted priest, who had killed a prior, a cousin of the queen, to escape from Newgate. Sir William Walworth in <datestruct value="1385--"><year reg="1385">1385</year></datestruct> left money to relieve the prisoners in Newgate, and Whittington left money to rebuild the prison. In <datestruct value="1457--"><year reg="1457">1457</year></datestruct> there was again a break-out from Newgate prison. Lord Egremond, Sir Thomas and Sir Richard Percy, committed to Newgate for a fray in the north country with the Earl of Salisbury's sons, in which fray many were maimed or slain, broke out of prison by night, and went to petition the king, the other prisoners, in the meantime, garrisoning the leads of Newgate, and defending it against all the sheriffs; till at last the citizens were called up to subdue and lay in irons the reckless rebels. 
<P>The gate was repaired in <datestruct value="1630--"><year reg="1630">1630</year></datestruct>-<num value="3">3</num>, destroyed in the Great Fire, and rebuilt in a stronger and more convenient way, with a postern for foot passengers. On the east or City side of the old prison were <num value="3">three</num> stone statues-Justice, Mercy, and Truth; and <num value="4">four</num> on the west, or Holborn side-Liberty (with Whittington's cat at her feet), Peace, Plenty, and Concord. <num value="4">Four</num> of these figures, which survived the Gordon riots, ornament part of the front of the present prison. 
<P>Howard, the philanthropist, writing in <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct>, gives a favourable account of the Newgate of <datestruct value="1779--"><year reg="1779">1779</year></datestruct>. 
<P> <QUOTE>The cells,</QUOTE> says Howard, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>built in old Newgate, a few years since, for condemned malefactors, are still used for the same purpose. There are upon each of the <num value="3">three</num> floors <num value="5">five</num>, all vaulted, near <num value="9">9</num> feet high to the crown. Those on the ground- <pb id="P.442" n="442"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.442.1">The Casket on Newgate</LEMMA></NOTE>
 floor measure full <num value="9">9</num> feet by near <num value="6">6</num> feet; the <num value="5">five</num> on the <num value="1">first</num> storey are a little larger (<num value="9.50">9 1/2</num> feet by <num value="6">6</num> feet), on account of the set-off in the wall; and the <num value="5">five</num> uppermost still a little larger, for the same reason. In the upper part of each cell is a window, double grated, near <num value="3">3</num> feet by <num value="1.50">1 1/2</num>. The doors are <num value="4">4</num> inches thick.   The strong stone wall is lined all round each cell with planks, studded with broad-headed nails.   In each cell is a barrack bedstead. I was told by those who attended them that criminals who had affected an air of boldness during their trial, and appeared quite unconcerned at the pronouncing sentence upon them, were struck with horror, and shed tears, when brought to these darksome, solitary abodes. 
<P>The chapel is plain and neat. Below is the chaplain's seat, and <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> pews for the felons; that in the centre is for the condemned. On each side is a gallery: that for the women is towards their ward; in it is a pew for the keeper, whose presence may set a good example, and be otherwise useful. The other gallery, towards the debtors' ward, is for them. The stairs to each gallery are on the outside of the chapel. I attended there several times, and Mr. Villette read the prayers distinctly, and with propriety.   The prisoners who were present seemed attentive; but we were disturbed by the noise in the court. Surely they who will not go to chapel, who are by far the greater number, should be locked up in their rooms during the time of divine service, and not suffered to hinder the edification of such as are better disposed. 
<P>The chaplain, or ordinary, besides his salary, has a house in Newgate Street, clear of land-tax; Lady Barnadiston's legacy, <measure value="6l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6">6</num></measure> a year; an old legacy paid by the Governors of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> a year; and lately had <num value="2">two</num> freedoms yearly, which commonly sold for <measure value="25l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="25">25</num></measure> each; and the City generally presented him, once in <num value="6">six</num> months, with another freedom. Now he has not the freedoms, but his salary is augmented to <measure value="180l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="180">180</num></measure>, and the sheriffs pay him <measure value="3l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3">3</num></measure> <measure value="12s." type=currency><num value="12">12</num>s.</measure> He engages, when chosen, to hold no other living. 
<P>Debtors have, every Saturday, from the Chamber of London, <num value="8">eight</num> stone of beef; fines, <num value="4">four</num> stone; and, some years, felons, <num value="8">eight</num> stone. Debtors have several legacies. I inquired for a list of them, and Mr. Akerman told me the table in Maitland's  <Q>Survey</Q>  was authentic.   The amount of it is <measure value="52l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="52">52</num></measure> <measure value="5s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="5">5</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> a year. There are other donations mentioned by Maitland, amounting to <num value="64">sixty-four</num> stone of beef, and <num value="5">five</num> dozen of bread <gap>
 
<P>Here I cannot forbear mentioning a practice, which probably had its origin from the ancient mode of torture, though now it seems only a matter of form. When prisoners capitally convicted at the Old Bailey are brought up to receive sentence, and the judge asks,  <Q>What have you to say why judgment of death and execution should not be awarded against you?</Q>  the executioner slips a whipcord noose about their thumbs. This custom ought to be abolished. 
<P>At my visit, in <datestruct value="1779--"><year reg="1779">1779</year></datestruct>, the gaol was clean, and free from offensive scents. On the felons' side there were only <num value="3">three</num> sick, in <num value="1">one</num> of the upper wards. An infirmary was building, near the condemned cells. Of the <num value="141">141</num> felons, &amp;c., there were <num value="91">ninety-one</num> convicts and fines who had only the prison allowance of a penny loaf a day. Mr. Akerman generously contributed towards their relief. In the felons' court the table of fees, painted on a board, was hung up. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.442.2">The gaol was burnt by the rioters in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct></LEMMA>. but is rebuilt on the same plan.   The men's quadrangle is now divided into <num value="3">three</num> courts. In the <num value="1">first</num> court are those who pay <measure value="3s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> a week for a bed; in the next, the poorer felons; and in the other, now, the women.   Under the chapel are cells for the refractory. <num value="2">Two</num> rooms, adjoining to the condemned cells, are built for an infirmary, in <num value="1">one</num> of which, at my last visit, there were <num value="16">sixteen</num> sick. Of the <num value="291">291</num> prisoners in <datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, <num value="225">225</num> were men and <num value="66">66</num> women. Upwards of <num value="100">100</num> of them were transports, <num value="89">89</num> fines, <num value="21">21</num> under sentence of death, and the remainder lay for trial. Some of the condemned had been long sick and languishing in their cells.</QUOTE>
 
<P>From the Old Bailey Session Papers for <datestruct VALUE="1780-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, we gather a very vivid and picturesque notion of the destruction of Newgate during the Gordon riots.   The mob came pouring down Holborn, between <num value="6">six</num> and <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock, on the evening of the <datestruct value="06-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>.   There were <num value="3">three</num> flags carried by the ringleaders--the <num value="1">first</num> of green silk, with a Protestant motto; the <num value="2">second</num>, dirty blue, with a red cross; the <num value="3">third</num>, a flag of the Protestant Union. A sailor named Jackson had hoisted the <num value="2">second</num> flag in Palace Yard, when Justice Hyde had launched a party of horse upon the people; and when the rabble had sacked the justice's house in St. Martin's Street, Jackson shouted, <QUOTE>Newgate, a-hoy!</QUOTE> and led the people on to the Old Bailey. Mr. Akerman, a friend of Boswell, and <num value="1">one</num> of the keepers of Newgate, had had intimation of the danger <num value="2">two</num> hours before, when a friend of <num value="1">one</num> of the prisoners called upon him just as he was packing up his plate for removal, told him <QUOTE>he should be the <num value="1">one</num> hung presently,</QUOTE> and cursed him. Exactly at <num value="7">seven</num>, <num value="1">one</num> of the rioters knocked at Mr. Akerman's door, which had been already barred, <pb id="P.443" n="443"> bolted, and chained. A maid-servant had just put up the shutters, when the glass over the hall-door was dashed into her face.   The ringleader who knocked was better dressed than the rest, and wore a dark brown coat and round hat. The man knocked <num value="3">three</num> times, and rang <num value="3">three</num> times; then, finding no <num value="1">one</num> came, ran down the steps, <QUOTE>made his obeisance to the mob,</QUOTE> pointed to the door, then retired.   The mob was perfectly organised, and led by about <num value="30">thirty</num> men walking <num value="3">three</num> abreast. <num value="30">Thirty</num> men carried iron crowbars, mattocks, and chisels, and after them followed <QUOTE>an innumerable company,</QUOTE> armed with bludgeons and the spokes of cart-wheels.   The band instantly divided into <num value="3">three</num> parts-<num value="1">one</num> set went to work at Mr. Akerman's door with the mattocks, a <num value="2">second</num> went to the debtors' door, and a <num value="3">third</num> to the felons'. A shower of bludgeons instantly demolished the windows of the keeper's house; and while these sticks were still falling in showers, <num value="2">two</num> men, <num value="1">one</num> of them a mad Quaker, the son of a rich corn-factor, who wore a mariner's jacket, came forward with a scaffold-pole, and drove it like a battering-ram against the parlour shutters. A lad in a sailor's jacket then got on a man's shoulders, and rammed in the half-broken shutters with furious blows of his bullet-head. A chimney-sweeper's boy then scrambled in, cheered by the mob, and after him the mad Quaker. A moment more, and the Quaker appeared at the <num value="1">first</num>-floor window, flinging out pictures into the street. Presently, the <num value="2">second</num> parlour window gave way, the house-door was forced, and the furniture and broken chattels in the street were set in a blaze. All this time a circle of men, better dressed than the rest, stood in the Old Bailey, exciting and encouraging the rioters. The leader of these sympathiser was a negro servant, named Benjamin Bowsey, afterwards hung for his share in the riot. <num value="1">One</num> of the leaders in this attack was a mad waiter from the St. Alban's Tavern, named Thomas Haycock. He was very prominent, and he swore that there should not be a prison standing in London on the morrow, and that the Bishop of London's house and the Duke of Norfolk's should come down that night. <QUOTE>They were well supported, he shouted to the mob,</QUOTE> for there were <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> noblemen and members of Parliament on their side. This man helped to break up a bureau, and collected sticks to bum down the doors of Akerman's house. While Akerman's house was still burning, the servants escaping over the roofs, and Akerman's neighbours were down among the. mob, entreating them to spare the houses of innocent persons, a waiter, named Francis Mockford, who wore a hat with a blue cockade in it, went up to the prison-gate and held up the main key, and shouted to the turnkeys, <QUOTE>D----! you, here is the key of Newgate; open the door!</QUOTE> Mockford, who was eventually sentenced to death for this riot, afterwards took the prison keys, and flung them over Westminster Bridge.   George Sims, a tripeman in St. James's Market, always forward in street quarrels, then went up to the great gate in the Old Bailey with some others, and swore desperately that <QUOTE>he would have the gates down-curse him, he would have the gates down!</QUOTE> Then the storm broke; the mob rushed on the gate with the sledge-hammers and pickaxes they had stolen from coachmakers, blacksmiths, and braziers in Drury Lane and Long Acre, and plied them with untiring fury. The tripeman, who carried a bludgeon, urged them   on; and the servant of Akerman, having known the man for several years, called to him through the hatch, <QUOTE>Very well, George the tripeman; I shall mark you in particular!</QUOTE> Then John Glover, a black, a servant of a Mr. Phillips, a barrister in Lincoln's Inn, who was standing on the steps leading to the felons' gate (the main gate), dressed in a rough short jacket, and a round hat trimmed with dirty silver lace, thumped at the door with a gun-barrel, which he afterwards tried to thrust through the grating into the faces of the turnkeys, while another split the door with a hatchet.   The mob, finding they could not force the stones out round the hatch, then piled Akerman's shattered furniture, and placing it against the gates set the heap on fire. 
<P>Several times the gate caught fire, and as often the turnkeys inside pushed down the burning furniture with broomsticks, which they pushed through the hatch, and kept swilling the gates with water, in order to cool them, and to keep the lead that soldered the hinges from melting and giving way.   But all their efforts were in vain; for the flames, now spreading fast from Akerman's house, gradually burnt in to the fore-lodge and chapel, and set the different wards <num value="1">one</num> after the other on fire. Crabbe--the poet, who was there as a spectator, describes seeing the prisoners come up out of the dark cells with their heavy irons, and looking pale and scared.   Some of them were carried off on horseback, their irons still on, in triumph by the mob, who then went and burnt down the Fleet. At the trial of Richard Hyde, the poor mad Quaker, who had been <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> to scramble through. Mr. Akerman's windows, the most conclusive proofs were brought forward of the prisoner's insanity. A grocer in Bishopsgate Street, with whom he had lodged, deposed to his burning a Bible, and to his thrashing him. <num value="1">One</num> day at the <QUOTE>Doctor <pb id="P.444" n="444"> Butler's Head,</QUOTE> in Coleman Street, the crazed fellow had come in, and pretended to cast the nativities of persons drinking there.   He also prophesied how long each of them would live.   On hearing this evidence, the prisoner broke out: <QUOTE>Well, and they might live <num value="300">three hundred</num> years, if they knew how to live; but they gorge themselves like aldermen. Callipash and callipee kills half the people.</QUOTE> It was also shown that, the night after the burning of Newgate, the prisoner came to a poor woman's house in Bedford Court, Covent Garden, and he then wore an old grey great-coat and a flapped hat, painted blue. As the paint was wet, the woman asked him to let her dry it. He replied, <QUOTE>No, you are a fool; my hat is <hi rend=italics>blue</hi></QUOTE> (the Protestant colour); <QUOTE>it is the colour of the heavens. I would not have it dried for the world.</QUOTE> When the woman brought him a pint of beer, he drank once, and then pushed it angrily on <num value="1">one</num> side.   He then said, <QUOTE>I have tasted it once, I must taste it <num value="3">three</num> times; it is against the heavens to drink only once out of a pot.</QUOTE> Doctor Munro, the physician who attended George III. in his madness, deposed to the insanity both of the prisoner's father and the prisoner. He was sent to a mad-house.

<P>Crabbe, who, having failed as a surgeon and apothecary down at Aldborough, his native place, had just come up to London to earn his bread as a poet, and being on the brink of starvation, was about to apply to Burke for patronage and bread. Rambling in a purposeless way about London to while away the miserable time, the young poet happened to reach the Old Bailey just as the ragged rioters set it on fire to warm their Protestantism. Suddenly, at a turning out of Ludgate Hill, on his way back to his lodgings at a hairdresser's shop near the Exchange, a scene of terror and horror broke red upon the view of the mild young Suffolk apothecary. The new prison, Crabbe says, in his 
<title>Journal</title> kept for the perusal of his Myra (<datestruct value="06-8"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=8>8th</day></datestruct>), was a very large, strong, and beautiful building, having <num value="2">two</num> wings besides Mr. Akerman's house, and strong intermediate works and other adjuncts. Akerman had <num value="4">four</num> rioters in custody, and these rascals the mob demanded. He begged he might send to the sheriff, but this was not per mitted. <QUOTE>How he escaped, or where he is gone, I know not; but just at the time I speak of, they set fire to his house, broke in, and threw every piece of furniture they could find into the street, <pb id="P.445" n="445">

 <pb id="P.446" n="446"> firing them also in an instant. The engines came</QUOTE> (they were mere squirts in those days), <QUOTE>but were only suffered to preserve the private houses near the prison.</QUOTE> This was about half-past <num value="7">seven</num>. <QUOTE>As I was standing near the spot, there approached another body of men--I suppose <num value="5">five</num> hundredand Lord George Gordon in a coach drawn by the mob, towards Alderman Bull's, bowing as he passed along. He is a lively-looking young man in appearance, and nothing more, though just now the reigning hero. By <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock Akerman's house was in flames.   I went close to it, and never saw anything so dreadful. The prison was, as I said, a remarkably strong building; but, determined to force it, they broke the gates with crows and other instruments, and climbed up the outside of the cell part, which joins the <num value="2">two</num> great wings of the building, where the felons were confined; and I stood where I plainly saw their operations. They broke the roof, tore away the rafters; and having got ladders they descended.   Not Orpheus himself had more courage or better luck.   Flames all around them, and a body of soldiers expected, they defied and laughed at all opposition. The prisoners escaped. I stood and saw about <num value="12">twelve</num> women and <num value="8">eight</num> men ascend from their confinement to the open air, and they were conducted through the street in their chains. <num value="3">Three</num> of these were to be hanged on Friday</QUOTE> (Newgate was burnt on the Tuesday). <QUOTE>You have no conception of the frenzy of the multitude. This being done, and Akerman's house now a mere shell of brickwork, they kept a store of flame there for other purposes. It became red-hot, and the doors and windows appeared like the entrance to so many volcanoes. With some difficulty they then fired the debtors' prison, broke the doors, and they, too, all made their escape.   Tired of the scene, I went home, and returned again at <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock at night.   I met large bodies of horse and foot soldiers, coming to guard the Bank, and some houses of Roman Catholics near it. Newgate was at this time open to all; any <num value="1">one</num> might get in, and, what was never the case before, any <num value="1">one</num> might get out. I did both, for the people were now chiefly lookers-on. The mischief was done, and the doers of it gone to. another part of the town</QUOTE> (to Bloomsbury Square, to burn Lord Mansfield's house). <QUOTE>But I must not omit what struck me most: about <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> of the mob getting to the top of the debtors' prison, whilst it was burning, to halloo, they appeared rolled in black smoke mixed with sudden bursts of fire--like Milton's infernals, who were as familiar with flame as with each other.</QUOTE> 
<P>On the Wednesday, the day after the fire, a big carelessly-dressed man worked his way to the ruins from Bolt Court, Fleet Street. The burly man's name was Doctor Samuel Johnson, and he wrote to Mrs. Thrale and her husband a brief account of what had happened since the Friday before. On that day Lord George Gordon and the mob went to Westminster, and that night the rioters burnt the Catholic chapel in Duke Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields. On Monday they gutted Sir George Saville's house in Leicester Square; on Tuesday pulled down the house of Sir John Fielding, the blind magistrate and the novelist's half-brother, in Bow Street; and the same night burnt Newgate, Lord Mansfield's house in Bloomsbury, and a Catholic chapel in Moorfields.   On Wednesday they burnt the Fleet and the King's Bench, and attacked the Bank of England, but were driven off by a party of constables headed by John Wilkes. 
<P> <QUOTE>On Wednesday,</QUOTE> says the doctor, to come to what he actually saw himself, <QUOTE><p>I walked with Doctor Scott, to look at Newgate, and found it in ruins, with the fire yet glowing. As I went by, the Protestants were plundering the Sessions House at the Old Bailey. There were not, I believe, a <num value="100">hundred</num>; but they did their work at leisure, in full security, without sentinels, without trepidation, as men lawfully employed in full day. Such is the cowardice of a commercial place. On Wednesday they broke open the Fleet, and the King's Bench, and the Marshalsea, and Wood Street Compter, and Clerkenwell Bridewell, and released all the prisoners.   At night they set fire to the Fleet, and to the King's Bench, and I don't know how many other places; and <num value="1">one</num> might see the glare of conflagration fill the sky from many parts. The sight was dreadful. Some people were threatened. Mr. Strahan advised me to take care of myself. 
<P>Several chapels have been destroyed, and several inoffensive Papists have been plundered; but the high sport was to burn the gaols. This was a good rabble trick. The debtors and the criminals were all set at liberty; but of the criminals, as has always happened, many are already re-taken, and <num value="2">two</num> pirates have surrendered themselves, and it is expected that they will be pardoned.</QUOTE> Then follows a fine touch of irony: <QUOTE>Jack</QUOTE> (Wilkes), <QUOTE>who was always zealous for order and decency, declares that if he be trusted with power, he will not leave a rioter alive. There is, however, now no longer any need of heroism or bloodshed   no blue ribbon</QUOTE> (the badge of the rioters) <QUOTE>is any longer worn.</QUOTE> As for Thrale, his brewery escaped pretty well. The men gave away a cask or <num value="2">two</num> of beer to the mob, and when the rioters came on a <num value="2">second</num> and more importunate visit, the soldiers received them. <pb id="P.447" n="447">

<P>In, the year <datestruct value="1744"><year reg="1744">1744</year></datestruct> Silas Told, a worthy Wesleyan, deeply touched by a sermon preached by Wesley on the text, <QUOTE>I was sick and in prison, and ye visited me not</QUOTE> (Matt. xxv. <num value="43">43</num>), began to exert himself among the prisoners at Newgate, and has left a graphic and simple-hearted account of his labours among them; and from this book we obtain many curious glimpses of prison life at that period. The <num value="1">first</num> persons Told visited were <num value="10">ten</num> malefactors, then under sentence of death. <QUOTE>The report having been made,</QUOTE> says Told, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>and the dead-warrant coming down, <num value="8">eight</num> of the <num value="10">ten</num> were ordered for execution.   The other <num value="2">two</num> were respited; nor did either of those <num value="2">two</num> appear to have any the least regard or concern for their deathless souls; therefore I trust they were spared for a good purpose, that they might have time for repentance and amendment of life. 
<P>The day arrived whereon the other <num value="8">eight</num> malefactors were to die. Sarah Peters and myself were early at the cell, in order to render them all the spiritual service that was within our power. The keeper having received directions on the over-night to lock them all up in <num value="1">one</num> cell, that they might pour out their souls together in fervent solemn prayer to Almighty God, they paid very circumspect attention thereto, and a happy night it proved to each of them; so that when they were led down from their cell, they appeared like giants refreshed with wine, nor was the fear of death apparent in any of their countenances. We then went up to the chapel, when my companion and myself conversed with them in the press-yard room. Upon being called out to have their irons taken off, Lancaster was the <num value="1">first</num>. While they were disburthening his legs thereof, the sheriff being present, Lancaster looked up to heaven with a pleasant smile, and said,  <Q>Glory be to God for the <num value="1">first</num> moment of my entrance into this place! For before I came hither my heart was as hard as my cell wall, and my soul was as black as hell. But, oh, I am now washed, clearly washed, from all my sins, and by <num value="1">one</num> o'clock shall be with Jesus in Paradise!</Q>  And with many strong and forcible expressions he exhorted the innumerable spectators to flee from the wrath to come. This caused the sheriff to shed tears; and ask Mr. Lancaster if he was really in earnest, being so greatly affected with his lively and animated spirit. As their irons were taken off they were remanded back to the press-yard room; but, by some accident, they were a long time getting off the last man's fetters. When they were gotten off, Lancaster, beholding him at a short distance, clapped his hands together, and joyfully proclaimed,  <Q>Here comes another of our little flock </Q>  A gentleman present said, with an apparent sympathising spirit,  <Q>I think it is too great a flock upon such an occasion.</Q>  Lancaster, with the greatest fluency of speech, and with an aspiring voice, said,  <Q> Oh, no; it is not too great a flock for the shepherd Jesus; there is room   enough in heaven for us all.</Q>  When he exhorted the populace to forsake their sins, he particularly endeavoured to press on them to come to the Throne of Grace immediately, and without fear, assuring them that they would find Him a gracious and merciful God, to forgive them, as He had forgiven him. At length they were ordered into the cart, and I was prevailed upon to go with them. When we were in the cart, I addressed myself to each of these separately.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Told's account of the execution of these men shows clearly how lawless and savage were the mobs which gathered at Tyburn.   <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>When we came to the fatal tree Lancaster lifted up his eyes, thereto, and said,  <Q>Blessed be God,</Q>  then prayed extemporary in a very excellent manner, and the others behaved with great discretion. John Lancaster had no friend who could procure for his body a proper interment; so that, when they had hung the usual space of time, and were cut down, the surgeon's mob secured the body of Lancaster, and carried it over to Paddington.   There was a very crowded concourse, among whom were numberless gin and gingerbread vendors, accompanied by pickpockets and even less respectable characters, of almost every denomination in London; in short, the whole scene resembled a principal fair, rather than an awful execution. Now, when the mob was nearly dispersed, and there remained only a few bystanders, with an old woman who sold gin, a remarkable occurrence took place, and operated to the following effect-- 
<P>A company of <num value="8">eight</num> sailors, with truncheons in their hands, having come to see the execution, <pb id="P.448" n="448"> looked up to the gallows with an angry countenance, the bodies having been cut down some minutes previous to their arrival.   The old woman before named, who sold gin, observing these tars to grow violent, by reason of their disappointment, mildly accosted them and said,  <Q>Gentlemen, I suppose you want the man that the surgeons have got?</Q>   <Q>Aye,</Q>  replied the sailors;  <Q>where is he?</Q>  The poor affrighted woman gave them to understand that the surgeons' crew had carried him over to Paddington, and she pointed out to them the direct road thereto. They hastened away, and as they entered the town, inquiry was made by them where the surgeons' mob was to be discovered, and receiving the information they wanted, they went and demanded the body of John Lancaster. When the sailors had obtained the body, <num value="2">two</num> of them cast it on their shoulders, and carried him round by Islington. They being tired out with its pressure, <num value="2">two</num> others laid themselves under the weight of the body, and carried it from thence to Shoreditch. Then <num value="2">two</num> more carried it from Shoreditch to Coverley's Fields. At length, after they were all rendered completely weary, and unable to carry it any farther, the sequel of their project, and their ultimate contrivance to rid themselves of the body was an unanimous consent to lay it on the step of the <num value="1">first</num> door they came to. They did so, and then went their way. This gave birth to a great riot in the neighbourhood, which brought an old woman, who lived in the house, down-stairs.   When she saw the corpse lie at the step of the door, she proclaimed, with an agitated spirit,  <Q>Lord, here is my son, John Lancaster!</Q>  This being spread abroad, came to the knowledge of the Methodists, who made a collection, and got him a shroud and a good strong coffin. I was soon informed of this event, which was peculiarly singular, as the seamen had no knowledge of the body, nor to whom he belonged when living.   My <num value="2">second</num> wife went with me to see him, previous to the burial; but neither of us could perceive the least alteration in his visage or features, or any appearance of violence on any part of his body.   A   pleasant smile appeared in his countenance, and he lay as in a sweet sleep.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Told gives a terrible picture of the state of Newgate about <datestruct value="1744--"><year reg="1744">1744</year></datestruct>-the felons swearing and cursing at the preacher, and the ordinary himself guarding the prison doors on Sunday morning, to obstruct Told's entrance. Told, however, zealous in the cause, persevered, and soon formed a society of about <num value="40">forty</num> of the debtors, who formed his Sunday congregation. The ordinary, however, soon contrived to shut out Told from this part of the prison also. He therefore betook himself almost entirely to the graver malefactors. His account of some of these unhappy men is extremely interesting. During his visits to Newgate <num value="6">six</num> men of good family were lying there, sentenced to death for highway robbery. Of these, <num value="1">one</num> was the son of an Irish divine, <num value="2">two</num> others were men of fortune, and a <num value="4">fourth</num> was a naval officer, to whom a daughter of the Duke of Hamilton was engaged to be married. After an election dinner, at Chelmsford, these men, for fun, had sallied out and robbed a farmer in the highway. The king was unwilling to pardon any of the party; but at the incessant importunities of Lady Elizabeth Hamilton, at last consented to reprieve her lover, but only at the gallows' foot. He fainted when the halter was removed, and was instantly lifted into the carriage, where Lady Betty awaited him.   <num value="6">Six</num> weeks after, to Told's vexation, he found the reprieved man gambling with a fraudulent bankrupt, who shortly afterwards was himself executed at Tyburn.   Told's next visit was to Mary Edmonson, a poor girl hung at Kennington Common for murdering her aunt at Rotherhithe. The girl was entirely innocent, and the real murderer, a relation, who was a foot-soldier, came up into the cart to salute her before she was turned off.   Some time after, this man riding in a post-chaise past the gallows at Kennington, said to a friend, <QUOTE>There is the place where my kinswoman was hung wrongfully.   I should have gone in her room.</QUOTE> The rascal was soon after found guilty of highway robbery, and cast for death, but reprieved by the judge, who did not wish to draw attention to the scandal of an innocent person having been sent to the gallows.   Silas Told says that at the execution of Mary Edmonson he walked by the cart, urging her to prayer, holding the bridle of the sheriff's horse, in spite of a most cruel and violent mob. Told also mentions attending Harris, the <QUOTE>Flying Highwayman,</QUOTE> to the gallows, a man who, the very morning of his execution, was so violent in the chapel that the ordinary ran for his life. Just beyond Hatton Garden, after some exhortations of honest Told, the indomitable ruffian, at his request, shut his eyes, hung back his head on the side-rail of the cart, and after <num value="10">ten</num> minutes' meditation burst into tears, and, clapping his hands together, cried, <QUOTE>Now I know that the Lord Jesus has forgiven me all my sins, and I have nothing to do but to die.</QUOTE> He then burst into a loud extemporary prayer, and continued happy to the last, but still denying that he ever <QUOTE>flew</QUOTE> a turnpikegate in his life. Another case mentioned by Told does not give us a very enlarged view of the tender <pb id="P.449" n="449"> mercies of the time. A poor man, Anderson, entirely destitute, was sentenced to death for taking sixpence from <num value="2">two</num> washerwomen in Hoxton Fields. The man had served with credit on board a manof-war, and his own parish had petitioned on his behalf. The Privy Council, however, insisted on confounding him with <num value="1">one</num> of the same name, a celebrated highwayman of the day, and to Tyburn he went. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, when Mr. Akerman, <num value="1">one</num> of the keepers, appeared before a Committee of the House of Commons, Newgate appears to have been a sink of filth and a den of iniquity. It was over-crowded, ill-disciplined, badly ventilated, and ill-supplied with water. The prisoners died in great numbers; and as Mr. Akerman, a good and trust official, stated, <num value="2">two</num> whole sets of gaol-officers had been cut off by gaol distemper since he had been in office; and in the spring of <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct> the gaol was so terribly infectious, that the contagion was carried into the Old Bailey court, and <num value="2">two</num> of the judges, the Lord Mayor, and several of the jury, more than <num value="60">sixty</num> in all, died in consequence.   A huge ventilator was then erected, but this alarmed the whole neighbourhood, and the residents complained, with bitter outcries, that the poisonous air was drawn from the prison cells, to destroy all who lived near. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> of the earliest anecdotes of Newgate is to be found in a letter to the Duke of Shrewsbury, dated <datestruct VALUE="1699-08-10"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=10>10</day>, <year reg=1699>1699</year></datestruct>. <QUOTE>All the talk of the town,</QUOTE> says the writer, <QUOTE>is about a tragical piece of gallantry at Newgate. I don't doubt but what your grace has heard of a bastard son of Sir George Norton, who was under sentence of death for killing a dancing-master in the streets. The Lords Justices reprieved him, till they heard from   the judge that no exception was to be. taken at the verdict.   It being signified to the young man, on Tuesday last in the afternoon, that he was to die the next day, his aunt, who was sister to his mother, brought <num value="2">two</num> doses of opium, and they took it between them.   The ordinary came soon after to perform his functions; but before he had done, he found so great alterations in both persons that it was no hard matter to find out the cause of it.   The aunt frankly declared she could not survive her nephew, her life being wrapped up in his; and he declared that the law having put a period to his life, he thought it no offence to choose the way he would go out of the world. The keeper sent for his apothecary to apply remedies, who brought <num value="2">two</num> vomits.   The young man refused to take it, till they threatened to force it down by instruments.   He told them, since he hoped the business was done, he would make himself and them easy, and swallowed the potion, and his aunt did the like.   The remedy worked upon her, and set her a-vomiting, but had no effect on Mr. Norton, so that he dozed away gradually, and by <num value="8">eight</num> that evening was grown senseless, though he did not expire till <num value="9">nine</num> next morning.   He was fully resolved upon the business, for he had likewise a charged pistol hid in the room. The aunt was carried to a neighbouring house, and has a guard upon her. They say she is like to recover; if she does, it will be hard if she suffer for such a transport of affection.</QUOTE> 
<P>Among the many guilty and unhappy criminals who have sat in Newgate and counted the moments that lay between them and death, <num value="1">one</num> of the most unhappy must have been that once popular preacher, Dr. Dodd, who was hung for forgery in <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct>. Dodd was the son of a clergyman who was vicar of Bourie, in Lincolnshire. On leaving Cambridge he married imprudently, and became a small poet, and compiler of the <title>Beauties of Shakespeare,</title> a work still reprinted. He then renounced literature, entered the Church, and in <datestruct value="1758--"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct> was appointed preacher to the Magdalen Hospital, where Horace Walpole describes his flowery sermons, which set all the ladies of fashion sobbing. Gross flattery of Dr. Squire, Bishop of St. David's, procured him, in <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct>, the prebendaryship of Brecon. Soon after this the grateful bishop introduced Dodd to the Earl of Chesterfield, as a tutor to his son, and about the same time Dodd was appointed <num value="1">one</num> of the king's chaplains, and in <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct> took his degree of LL.D. at Cambridge.   He now dabbled in lotteries, and, having won a <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> prize, erected a chapel near Buckingham Palace, and also bought a share in Charlotte Chapel, Bloomsbury. Overwhelmed with debt, Dodd brought out several religious works, with the hope of winning patrons by his fulsome dedications.   In <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct> he was appointed chaplain to the young Lord Chesterfield, the hopeless cub to whom the celebrated 
<title>Letters</title> were addressed.   The rich living of St. George's, Hanover Square, just then falling vacant, Dodd was unwise enough to write an anonymous letter to Lady Apsley, wife of the Lord Chancellor, offering   <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure> for the appointment. The letter was traced to its source, and handed to the king, and the writer's name was ordered immediately to be struck out of the list of chaplains. Foote, always cruel in his fun, introduced Dodd into <num value="1">one</num> of his Haymarket pieces as Dr. Simony. Dodd promised an explanation, but it never came. He retired for a time to Geneva, and the society of Lord Chesterfield, till the storm blew over. Though enjoying an income of <measure value="800l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="800">800</num></measure> a year, <pb id="P.450" n="450"> Dodd, entangled by press of debts, <num value="1">one</num> fatal day, signed the name of Lord Chesterfield, his old pupil, to a bond for <measure value="4200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4200">4,200</num></measure>. The signature disowned, Dodd, who then lived in Argyle Street, was apprehended. He at once repaid part of the money, and gave a judgment on his goods for the remainder. The prosecutors were reluctant to proceed; and Lord Chesterfield; it is said, placed the forgery in Dodd's hands, as he stood near a fire, in hopes that he would destroy it; but Dodd wanted promptitude and presence of mind, and soon after the Lord Mayor compelled the prosecution. He was tried and found guilty. Dr. Johnson, on being applied to, wrote the speech delivered by Dodd before his sentence. He--also composed several petitions for him, and a sermon which Dr. Dodd delivered to his fellow-prisoners shortly before his execution. 
<FIGURE id="Fig.450" n="2000.07.0161"><HEAD>The Condemned Cell In Newgate.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
<P>In Newgate this vain and shallow man acted the martyr, and wrote a book called <title>Thoughts in Prison,</title> and believed in the possibility of a reprieve, though the king was inflexible, because in a recent case of forgery (that of Daniel and Robert Perreau, wine merchants), the sentence had been carried out. <QUOTE>If Dr. Dodd is pardoned,</QUOTE> the king said, <QUOTE>then the Perreaus were murdered.</QUOTE> 
<P>The friends of Dodd were zealous to the last. Dr. Johnson told Boswell that <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> were ready for any gaoler who would let him   escape.   A wax image of him had also been made, to be left in his bed, but the scheme, somehow or other, miscarried.   Anthony Morris Storer, writing to George Selwyn, who had a passion for executions, thus describes Dodd's behaviour at Tyburn: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>The doctor, to all appearance, was rendered <pb id="P.451" n="451"> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.451" n="2000.07.0162"><HEAD>The Old Sessions' House In The Old Bailey In <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="P.452" n="452"> perfectly stupid from despair, His hat was flapped all round, and pulled over his eyes, which were never directed to any object around, nor even raised, except now and then lifted up in the course of his prayers. He came in a coach, and a very heavy shower of rain fell just upon his entering the cart, and another just at his putting on his night-cap. 
<P>He was a considerable time in praying, which some people standing about seemed rather tired with; they rather wished for some more interesting part of the tragedy.   The wind, which was high, blew off his hat, which rather embarrassed him, and discovered to us his countenance, which we could scarcely see before.   His hat, however, was soon restored to him, and he went on with his prayers.   There were <num value="2">two</num> clergymen attending him, <num value="1">one</num> of whom seemed very much affected; the other, I suppose, was the ordinary of Newgate, as he was perfectly indifferent and unfeeling in everything that he said and did. 
<P>The executioner took both the hat and wig off at the same time.   Why he put on his wig again I do not know, but he did, and the doctor took off his wig a <num value="2">second</num> time, and then tied on a nightcap which did not fit him; but whether he stretched that, or took another, I could not perceive. He then put on his nightcap himself, and upon his taking it, he certainly had a smile on his countenance. Very soon afterwards there was an end of all his hopes and fears on this side the grave. He never moved from the place he <num value="1">first</num> took in the cart; seemed absorbed in despair, and utterly dejected without any other signs of animation but in praying.</QUOTE>
 
<P>There is a tradition that the hangman had been bribed to place the knot of the rope in a particular manner under Dodd's ear, and also that when cut down, the body was driven off to a house in Goodge Street, where Pott, the celebrated surgeon, endeavoured to restore animation. But the crowd had been great, and the delay too long; nevertheless, it was believed by many at the time that Dodd was really resuscitated and sent abroad. His wife, who regarded him with great affection, died some years after, in poverty. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct> Governor Wall was hung at Newgate, for the murder of Benjamin Armstrong, a soldier, who had been under his command at Goree, in Africa. The high rank of Wall, and the long period that had elapsed since the crime had been committed, excited great interest in his fate. He had been Governor of Goree in <datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, and was disliked by both officers and men, for his severe and unforgiving disposition. The day before he returned to England, worn out with the climate, <num value="20">twenty</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> men of the African corps came to petition the governor with regard to certain money stopped from their pay. The spokesman at the head of these soldiers was the unfortunate Benjamin Armstrong, who was extremely respectful in his manner, and paid the governor every deference. Wall, whose temper was no doubt aggravated by illness, instantly ordered Armstrong and his companions back to the barracks, and threatened them with punishment. The men obeyed, and quietly retired. Soon after his dinner-hour, Wall ran out of his rooms, and beat a man who appeared to be drunk, and snatching a bayonet from the sentry, struck him with it, and ordered both men under arrest. Eager for revenge on the <QUOTE>mutinous rascals,</QUOTE> as he called them, Wall then ordered the long-roll to be beat, and parade called. <num value="300">Three hundred</num> men, without firearms, were formed into a circle, <num value="2">two</num> deep, in the midst of which stood the drummers, and the governor and his staff. A gun-carriage was then dragged up, and Benjamin Armstrong was called from the ranks. <num value="5">Five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> black slaves then lashed the unfortunate soldier to the rings of the gun-carriage, and Armstrong was ordered <num value="800">800</num> lashes. With unusual cruelty, the governor ordered the slaves to use, not the cat-o&lsquo;--<num value="9">nine</num>-tails, but long lashings of rope, nearly an inch in circumference. Every <num value="25">twenty-five</num> lashes a fresh slave was called up to continue the punishment, and the governor encouraged the slaves by shouting <QUOTE>Lay on, you black beasts, or I'll lay on you. Cut him to the heart; cut his liver out.</QUOTE> At the end of this ferocity, Armstrong, with his back beaten black, was led to the hospital, saying he should certainly die. The rope had bruised, not cut the flesh, yet the injuries were only the more dangerous. <num value="5">Five</num> days after the governor left Goree Armstrong died. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct> Wall was arrested at Bath, but managed to escape from the king's messengers, at the <QUOTE>Brown Bear,</QUOTE> Reading, and escaped to France, where he changed his name. Many years later Wall rashly returned to England, and in <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct> wrote to Lord Pelham, Secretary of State, announcing his readiness to submit to a trial. He was tried in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>. He pleaded that Armstrong was the ringleader of an open mutiny. A prisoner had been released, he himself had been threatened with a bayonet, and the soldiers had threatened to break open the stores. He denied that he had ever blown men from cannon. It was clear from the evidence that the grossest. cruelty had been used, and Wall was at once found guilty, and sentence of death passed. 
<P>In that curious and amusing work, <title>A Book for a Rainy Day,</title> Mr. J. T. Smith, formerly keeper of the Print Room in the British Museum, says:-- <pb id="P.453" n="453"> <QUOTE>Solomon, a pencil dealer, assured me that he could procure me a sight of the governor, if I would only accompany him in the evening to Hatton Garden, and smoke a pipe with Dr. Ford, the ordinary of Newgate, with whom he said he was particularly intimate.   Away we trudged, and upon entering the club-room of a public-house, we found the said doctor most pompously seated in a superb masonic chair, under a stately crimson canopy, placed between the windows.   The room was clouded with smoke whiffed to the ceiling, which gave me a better idea of what I had heard of the Black Hole of Calcutta than any place I had seen. There were present at least a <num value="100">hundred</num> associates of every denomination. Of this number, my Jew, being a favoured man, was admitted to a whispering audience with the doctor, which soon produced my introduction to him.</QUOTE> 
<P>Sunrise, the next morning, found Mr. Smith waiting by appointment for his new friend, Dr. Ford, at Newgate; and this is how he describes the end of Governor Wall: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>As we crossed the press-yard a cock crew, and the solitary clanking of a restless chain was dreadfully horrible. The prisoners had not risen. Upon our entering a cold stone room, a most sickly stench of green twigs, with which an old roundshouldered, goggle-eyed man was endeavouring to kindle a fire, annoyed me almost as much as the canaster fumigation of the doctor's Hatton Garden friends. 
<P>The prisoner entered. He was death's counterfeit, tall, shrivelled, and pale; and his soul shot so piercingly through the port-holes of his head, that the <num value="1">first</num> glance of him nearly terrified me. I said in my heart, putting my pencil in my pocket,  <Q>God forbid that I should disturb thy last moments!</Q>  His hands were clasped, and he was truly penitent. After the yeoman had requested him to stand up, he  <Q>pinioned him,</Q>  as the Newgate phrase is, and tied the cord with so little feeling, that the governor, who had not given the wretch the accustomed fee, observed,  <Q>You have tied me very tight,</Q>  upon which Dr. Ford ordered him   to slacken the cord, which he did, but not without muttering.  <Q>Thank you, sir,</Q>  said the governor to the doctor,  <Q>it is of little moment.</Q>  He then observed to the attendant, who had brought in an immense iron shovelful of coals to throw on the fire,  <Q>Ay, in <num value="1">one</num> hour that will be a blazing fire;</Q>  then, turning to the doctor, questioned him,  <Q>Do tell me, sir: I am informed I shall go down with great force; is that so?</Q>  After the construction and action of the machine had been explained, the doctor questioned the governor as to what kind of men he had at Goree.  <Q>Sir,</Q>  he answered,  <Q>they sent me the very riff-raff.</Q>  The poor soul then joined the doctor in prayer; and never did I witness more contrition at any condemned sermon than he then evinced.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Directly the execution was over, Mr. Smith left Newgate, where the hangman was selling the rope that had hung Governor Wall for a shilling an inch, and in Newgate Street a starved old man was selling another identical rope, at the   ridiculously low price of only sixpence an inch; while at the north-east corner of Warwick Lane a woman known as <QUOTE>Rosy Emma,</QUOTE> reputed wife of the yeoman of the halter, was selling a <num value="3">third</num> identical noose to the Epping buttermen, who had come that morning to Newgate Market. 
<P>The execution, in the year <datestruct value="1807"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, of <num value="2">two</num> men, named Haggerty and Holloway, for the. murder in <datestruct VALUE="1802-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, of Mr. Steel, a lavendermer- chant in the Strand, led to a frightful catastrophe. The body of the murdered man was found in a gravel-pit between Hounslow and Staines, the head crushed in by the blow of a bludgeon. Nothing could be discovered of the offenders till the beginning of <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, when Hanfield, a convict at Portsmouth, confessed that he had helped in the murder, and disclosed the names of his <num value="2">two</num> accomplices.   <num value="1">One</num> of these men, Haggerty, was a marine on board the <title>Shannon</title> frigate, then lying in at Deal; the other, Holloway, a thief, was then lying in Clerkenwell Prison. The informer's story was this :--The robbery had been planned at the <QUOTE>Black Horse and Turk's Head,</QUOTE> Dyot Street, Bloomsbury, whence the <num value="3">three</num> men had started together to Hounslow Heath. The doomed man came at the time expected, and they knocked him down. While they were searching him   a night-coach appeared, and Mr. Steele struggled to get across the road.   Holloway then called out, <QUOTE>I'll silence the beggar,</QUOTE> and killed him with <num value="2">two</num> furious blows of a bludgeon.   The evidence of this man was much doubted at the time. He had been a hackney-coachman, and a thief, and had deserted from several regiments; and it was proved that he had been heard to say, that rather than bear <num value="7">seven</num> years at the hulks, he would hang as many men as were killed at the battle of Copenhagen. In the court, the <num value="2">two</num> men, who were found guilty, pleaded their innocence, and, the last act of Holloway, in the press-yard, was to fall on his knees, and declare before God that he was innocent. Haggerty also protested his innocence, but without going on his knees. On the day of execution some <num value="80000">80,000</num> people assembled. Even before the prisoners appeared, several women were trampled to death. At the end of Green Arbour <pb id="P.454" n="454"> Court, a pieman and his basket being upset, many persons fell and perished.   <num value="1">One</num> poor woman, feeling herself lost, threw an infant at her breast to a bystander, who passed it on and on, till it was placed safely under a cart. In <num value="1">one</num> part of the crowd <num value="7">seven</num> persons died from suffocation alone. A cart, overladen with spectators, broke down, and many of those who were in it were trampled to death. Nothing could be so horrible as this fighting crowd, mad with rage and fear. Till the gallows was removed, and the marshals and constables cleared the street, nothing could be done for the sufferers. <num value="28">Twenty-eight</num> persons were killed and nearly <num value="70">seventy</num> injured in this brutal struggle. 
<P>The execution of the Cato Street conspirators before Newgate, on Monday, <datestruct VALUE="1820-05-1"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1820>1820</year></datestruct>, was <num value="1">one</num> of the most ghastly scenes ever witnessed by a London mob. Thistlewood, the leader of this conspiracy, had been in the Marines. His companions were James Ings, a butcher; Richard Tidd, a bootmaker; William Davidson, a cabinetmaker; John T. Brunt, and others. They had agreed to take advantage of a dinner at the Earl of Harrowby's, in Grosvenor Square, to which all the cabinet ministers had been invited, to break in and murder them all. Ings had resolved that the heads of Lords Castlereagh and Sidmouth should be cut off and put in <num value="2">two</num> bags provided for the purpose; and he particularly wished to preserve the right hand of Lord Castlereagh as a valuable curiosity. The cannon in Gray's Inn Lane and the Artillery Ground were to be captured, the Mansion House taken, the Bank sacked, the barracks fired, and a Provisional Government established. Pikes and guns had been collected, and hand-grenades made. The conspirators were discovered <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.454.1">in a loft in Cato Street</LEMMA>, Edgware Road. Smithers, about the <num value="1">first</num> police-officer who entered, was run through with a sword by Thistlewood, and a desperate struggle then ensued. At this moment Captain Fitzclarence (son of the Duke of Clarence) arrived, with a party of the Coldstream Guards, and captured <num value="9">nine</num> of the conspirators. Thistlewood was taken the next day, at a house in Little Moorfields. 
<P>At the trial <num value="11">eleven</num> of the conspirators were sentenced to death, but <num value="6">six</num> of these were afterwards respited.   Thistlewood, Ings, Brunt, Tidd, and Davidson were executed.   The Government had shown the utmost anxiety to prevent a riot or a rescue. Life Guards were stationed in the Old Bailey, Newgate Street, and Ludgate Hill, and <num value="100">one hundred</num> artillerymen and <num value="6">six</num> pieces of artillery were placed in the centre of Blackfriars Bridge. The scaffold was lined with black cloth, and near the drop were <num value="5">five</num> plain coffins, and a block for the decapitation of the criminals.   Thistlewood was the <num value="1">first</num> to ascend the scaffold. He was collected and calm, and bowed twice to the crowd. When Mr. Cotton exhorted him to pray, and asked him if he repented of his crime, he exclaimed, several times, <QUOTE>No, not at all!</QUOTE> and was also heard to say, <QUOTE>I shall soon know the last grand secret.</QUOTE> Tidd ran up the steps, and bowed on all sides. There was a slight cheering when he appeared, in which he made a faint attempt to join. Ings seemed mad with excitement.   He moved his head to and fro, cried <QUOTE>Huzza!</QUOTE> <num value="3">three</num> times, and commenced singing, <QUOTE>Oh, give me death or liberty</QUOTE> There was partial cheering.. He exclaimed, from time to time, <QUOTE>Here we go, my lads! You see the last remains of James Ings. Remember, I die the enemy of tyranny, and would sooner die in chains than live in slavery.</QUOTE> When the chaplain exhorted him, the reckless ruffian said, with a coarse laugh, <QUOTE>I am not afraid to go before God or man.</QUOTE> Then he shouted to the silent executioner, <QUOTE>Now, old man, finish me tidy. Pull the halter a little tighter: it might slip.</QUOTE> He then waved a handkerchief <num value="3">three</num> times, and said he hoped the chaplain would give him a good character. Davidson, a man of colour, who had just received the sacrament, prayed with great fervency, and expressed penitence for his crimes. All he said was, <QUOTE>God bless you all! Good-bye!</QUOTE> and after the Lord's Prayer, he exclaimed, <QUOTE>God save the king!</QUOTE> 
<P>Brunt, the last who came out, requested some bystander to get him some snuff out of his pocket, as his hands were tied.   He took it with great coolness, and said he wondered where the gaoler would put him, but he supposed it would be somewhere where he should sleep well: He would make a present of his body to King George the <num value="4">Fourth</num>. 
<P>Thistlewood, just before he was turned off, said in a low tone to a person under the scaffold, <QUOTE>I have now but a few moments to live, and I hope the world will think that I have at least been sincere in my endeavours.</QUOTE> At the last moment, Tidd cried out to   Ings, <QUOTE>How   are you, my hearty?</QUOTE> 
<P>At a signal given by the Rev. Mr. Cotton the platform fell. At the very instant Ings was observed to join Davidson in prayer. Half an hour after, a <QUOTE>resurrection-man,</QUOTE> who received a fee of <num value="20">twenty</num> guineas, disguised in a rough jacket and trousers, and a mask on his face, appeared with an amputating-knife, and severed Thistlewood's head from his body. The hangman's man then held up the head by the hair, and exclaimed <num value="3">three</num> times, <pb id="P.455" n="455"> <QUOTE>This is the head of Arthur Thistlewood, a traitor.</QUOTE> The same ceremony was then performed with skill on Tidd, Ings, Davidson, and Brunt.   The. mob loudly hissed, and there was a deep groan from the crowd, and shrieks from the women, when Thistlewood's head was removed. When the conspirators appeared on the scaffold, the troops were ordered as close as possible to the scene of execution; but no disorder took place. <num value="5">Five</num> of the remaining conspirators were transported for life. 
<P>The execution of Fauntleroy, the great banker, of <num value="6">6</num>, Berners Street, took place at Newgate, in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>. It was supposed that this man, by forged powers of attorney, had disposed of about <measure value="400000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400000">400,000</num></measure> worth of Bank of England stock; the Bank, however, prosecuted for only      <measure value="170000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="170000">170,000</num></measure> worth. Such was Fauntleroy's audacity, that it is said he would sometimes forge the name of a man with whom he was conversing, and then send it, still wet, into the clerks' room, to show that it had just been written by his visitor. Singularly enough, a tin box was found in his possession, with a list of the greater part of his frauds, and this formal statement at the bottom of all:-- <QUOTE>In order to keep up the credit of our house, I have forged powers of attorney for the above sums and parties, and sold out to the amount here stated, and without the knowledge of my partners. I kept up the payments of the dividends, but made no entries of such payments in our books. <hi rend=italics>The Bank began <num value="1">first</num> to refuse to discount our acceptances, and destroy the credit of our house. The Bank shall smart for it</hi>.</QUOTE> It was known that Fauntleroy was an epicure and a voluptuary, but his hospitality had won many friends, and no <num value="1">one</num> doubted his honour.   He attributed his losses to building speculations. He denied embezzling <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure>. <num value="16">Sixteen</num> respectable witnesses vouched for his honour and integrity. The crowd at his execution, on the <datestruct value="11-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, was unprecedented. Every window and house-roof near Newgate was crowded with well-dressed men. Nothing had been seen like the mob since Thistlewood and his gang were decapitated. When the sheriffs entered the banker's cell, at a quarter before <num value="8">eight</num>, he lifted his eyes sadly, bowed, but said nothing. The felon was still a gentleman. He was dressed in a black coat and trousers, with silk stockings, and dress shoes. He was perfectly calm and composed. The terrible procession formed quickly. <num value="2">Two</num> friends gave him their arms, and he followed the sheriffs and the Rev. Mr. Cotton, the ordinary of Newgate. The moment he appeared every hat was taken off. <num value="2">Two</num> minutes more, and his body swayed in the thick November air. 
<P>Only <num value="2">two</num> other executions for forgery ever took place in England; and in <datestruct value="1837--"><year reg="1837">1837</year></datestruct> the capital punishment for that crime was abolished. The late Mr. Charles Dickens used to relate an anecdote of the last moments of Fauntleroy. His elegant dinners had always been enriched by some remarkable and matchless curacoa. <num value="3">Three</num> of his boon companions had a parting interview with him in the condemned cell. They were about to retire, when the most impressive of the <num value="3">three</num> stepped back, and said, <QUOTE>Fauntleroy, you stand on the verge of the grave. Remember the text, my dear man, that  <Q>we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can take nothing out.</Q>  Have you any objection, therefore, to tell me now, as a friend, where you got that curacoa?</QUOTE> 
<P>It was long rumoured in London, of course absurdly, that Fauntleroy, by means of his vast wealth and acquaintance, had bribed the hangman to slip a silver tube down his throat, which saved his life. More resolute people declared he had escaped to America, and had actually been seen in Paris. So legends, even in our own days, spring up and take root. 
<P>The murder of a poor Italian boy, by a bodysnatcher named Bishop, and another scoundrel called Williams, excited the utmost horror and alarm in London, in the year <datestruct value="1831"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>. Upwards of <num value="30000">30,000</num> persons assembled to witness their execution, on the <datestruct value="12-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, at Newgate. These men had decoyed the poor boy to a hovel in Nova Scotia Gardens, Bethnal Green, and had then drugged him with rum and laudanum, and drowned him in a well. At King's College they had asked <num value="12">twelve</num> guineas for the body, and Bishop owned to having sold from <num value="500">500</num> to <num value="1000">1,000</num> bodies, and to <num value="2">two</num> other murders. The <QUOTE>Fortune of War</QUOTE> public-house, in Giltspur Street, seems to have been the rendezvous of these monsters. A great many persons were maimed and bruised at these executions, and the moment the murderers were turned off, the barriers between the gallows and Ludgate Hill were simultaneously broken asunder and torn up by the crowd. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1837--"><year reg="1837">1837</year></datestruct> the execution of James Greenacre lent an additional horror to Newgate. This man had murdered Hannah Brown, a woman to whom he had been engaged to be married, and had then cut the body in pieces, and hidden portions of it in various parts of London, the trunk being placed in a sack, and concealed behind some flagstones, near the <QUOTE>Pine Apple</QUOTE> toll-bar, Edgware Road. He confessed at last that Hannah Brown had deceived him, by pretending to have property, and that <num value="1">one</num> night, when she called at his lodgings, in Carpenters' Buildings, Lambeth, she laughed at her <pb id="P.456" n="456"> trick. In a rage at this, he struck her with a silkroller a blow which proved mortal, and he then formed the resolution of cutting up and concealing the body. 
<P>The night of the execution of this wretch, hundreds of persons slept on the steps of the prison and of St. Sepulchre's Church, and boys remained all night clinging to the lamp-posts. The crowds in the streets spent the night in ribald jokes and drunken scuffles. Greenacre, when he passed to the gallows, was totally unmanned. He could not articulate the responses to the ordinary, and was obliged to be supported, or he would have fallen. His last words, with a look of contempt at the yelling and hissing crowd, were, <QUOTE>Don't leave me long in the concourse.</QUOTE> 
<P>Another of the celebrated executions at Newgate was that of Franz Muller, a young German tailor, in <datestruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct>. This man, in order, it is supposed, to obtain money to get to America, murdered a Mr. Briggs, in a carriage on the North London Railway, between Bow station and Hackney Wick. The murdered man's hat, watch, and chain had been seen in the possession of the murderer, who had fled to New York. Muller denied his guilt to the last. The night before the execution there was a most disgraceful scene round Newgate.   The houses 
<FIGURE id="Fig.456" n="2000.07.0163"><HEAD>Cato Street. (From A View Published In <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 commanding a sight of the drop were filled with spectators, who paid for places, at prices ranging from <num value="5">five</num> or <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">seven</num> shillings</measure> to a couple of guineas a head. In some instances a <num value="1">first</num>-floor was let for <measure value="12l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="12">12</num></measure>.   The visitors (not always of the lower description) spent the night playing at cards and singing choruses. To <num value="1">one</num> of the exhortations to confession from those who visited him, Miller turned away, with the remark, <QUOTE>Man has no power to forgive sins, and there is no use in confessing them to him.</QUOTE> As he approached the gallows he looked up at the chain with perfect self-possession.   The final conversation with the German minister of the Lutheran Church in Alie Street, Goodman's Fields, was to the following effect:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><sp><speaker>Dr. Cappel:</speaker><p>Muller, in a few moments you will stand before God. I ask you again, and for the last time, are you guilty, or not guilty? 
<sp><speaker>Muller :</speaker><p>Not guilty. 
<sp><speaker>Dr. Cappel:</speaker><p>You are not guilty? 
<sp><speaker>Muller:</speaker><p>God knows what I have done. 
<sp><speaker>Dr. Cappel:</speaker><p>God knows what you have done. Does He also know that you have committed this crime? 
<sp><speaker>Muller:</speaker><p>Yes, I have done it.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Dr. Cappel was actually leaning forward and listening when the drop fell.   The Germans of London had exerted themselves warmly to obtain a reprieve for Muller, and even the King of Prussia <pb id="P.457" n="457"> telegraphed to the Queen to request her intervention to save Miller's life. 
<P>The execution of Francois Benjamin Courvoisier, a Swiss valet, found guilty of the murder of his master, Lord William Russell, took place at Newgate in <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>. Lord William, who was in his seventythird year, lived alone in his house, in Norfolk Street, Park Lane, his establishment consisting of <num value="2">two</num> women-servants and Courvoisier, a Swiss valet. On the morning of the murder the housemaid, rising as usual, found the papers in her master's writing-room scattered about, and in the hall an opera-glass, a cloak, and some other articles of dress wrapped up, as if ready to be carried off. She instantly went up-stairs and called Courvoisier, who was almost dressed, and he at once ran 
<FIGURE id="Fig.457" n="2000.07.0164"><HEAD>Mrs. Brownrigg. (From The Original Print.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 down, saying, <QUOTE>Some person has been robbing; for God's sake go and see where his lordship is.</QUOTE> They went into the room, and found Lord William on his bed murdered, and his head nearly severed from his body. When the policeman came, and asked Courvoisier to assist him, he fell back in a chair, and said, <QUOTE>This is a shocking job. I shall lose my place, and lose my character.</QUOTE> The premises having been searched, <num value="2">two</num> bank-notes for <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> and <measure value="5l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5">5</num></measure>, supposed to have been taken from Lord Russell's box, and several rings, were found concealed behind the skirting-board of the butler's pantry.   Suspicion at once fell on Courvoisier; and on being tried and found guilty, he confessed the murder. He said that, disliking his place, he stole some plate, and had subsequently resolved to <pb id="P.458" n="458"> rob the house. Then before midnight his master found him in the dining-room, and suspected him of theft. On Lord William's return to his room, the thought of murder <num value="1">first</num> entered Courvoisier's mind. His character was gone, and he said he thought the only way to cover his fault was the murder of his master. He went into the dining-room, and took a carving-knife from the side-board. He then went up-stairs and opened his master's bed-room door. There was a rushlight burning, and Lord William was asleep. Courvoisier accomplished the murder, the old man never speaking a word, and only moving his arm a little. Courvoisier then opened a Russia leather case, took several things, and also a <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> note, which he hid behind the skirtingboard. After he had committed this foul murder, Courvoisier went to bed, as usual, having <num value="1">first</num> made marks on the outer door, as if there had been thieves there. The execution of Courvoisier took place on the <datestruct VALUE="1840-07-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>. His constant exclamation in prison had been, <QUOTE>O God! how could I have committed so dreadful a crime? It was madness. When I think of it I can't believe it.</QUOTE> He also confessed that he had contemplated self-destruction. Upwards of <num value="20000">20,000</num> persons had gathered to witness the murderer's end. Several hundreds had waited all night at the debtors' door of the Old Bailey, and high fees had been paid for windows, and even the roofs of the houses opposite Newgate were crowded.   There was a sprinkling of women and boys in the crowd, and a distinguishable number of men-servants. As the bell began to toll, at <num value="5">five</num> minutes to <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock, the vast multitude uncovered, and at <num value="2">two</num> minutes after the hour Courvoisier ascended the steps leading to the drop, followed by the executioner and the ordinary of the prison. A few yells were uttered, but the mass of the spectators were silent. Courvoisier's step was steady and collected, his face pale, but calm and unmoved. When on the drop he waved his bound hands up and down <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times, and this was the only visible symptom   of emotion. When the noose was adjusted, he lifted up his hands to his breast, as if in fervent prayer. He died without any violent struggle, his raised hands gradually sinking. His counsel, Mr. C. Phillips, was afterwards much blamed for trying to prove the police guilty of conspiracy, to obtain the large reward, when, as it was said, Courvoisier had already confessed to him his guilt; but the confession of Courvoisier was really of a much later date. 
<P>There is still an old print extant (of which we give a copy on page <num value="457">457</num>), representing that cruel old hag, Mrs. Elizabeth Brownrigg, in the condemned cell at Newgate. This celebrated murderess, who was nearly torn to pieces by the mob, on her way to Tyburn, was a parish midwife, living in Flowerde-Luce Court, Fetter Lane. Her cruelties to her apprentices we have before related. 
<P>Of the cruelties of the old press-yard we have a terrible instance, in the case of Edward Burnworth, in <datestruct value="1726--"><year reg="1726">1726</year></datestruct>. This man, a most daring highwayman and murderer, having refused to plead, was loaded with boards and weights. He continued an hour and <num value="3">three</num> minutes, with a mass of metal upon him weighing <num value="300">three hundred</num>, <num value="3">three</num> quarters, and <measure value="2l." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> pounds</measure>.   He then prayed he might be put to the bar again, which the court granted, and he was arraigned, and pleaded <QUOTE>not guilty.</QUOTE> He was, however, found guilty, and received sentence of death. 
<P>There is an interesting story of Mr. Akerman, <num value="1">one</num> of the old governors of Newgate, with whom Boswell contracted a friendship. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, says Boswell, a fire broke out in Newgate.     The prisoners were turbulent and in much alarm. Mr. Akerman, addressing them, told them there was no fear, for the fire was not in the stone prison; and that if they would be quiet, he then promised to come in among them, and lead them to a further end of the building; offering, in addition, not to leave them till they were reassured, and gave him leave. To this generous proposal they agreed. Mr. Akerman then, having <num value="1">first</num> made them fall back from the gate, lest they should be tempted to break out, went in, closed the gate, and, with the determined resolution of an ancient Roman, ordered the outer turnkey upon no account to unbar the gate, even though the prisoners should break their word (which he trusted they would not), and by force bring him to order it. <QUOTE>Never mind me,</QUOTE> said he, <QUOTE>should that happen.</QUOTE> The prisoners then peaceably followed him though passages of which he had the keys, to a part of the gaol the farthest from the fire.   Having, by this judicious conduct, says Boswell, fully satisfied them that there was no immediate risk, if any at all, he then addressed them: <QUOTE>Gentlemen, you are now convinced that I told you true.   I have no doubt that the engines will soon extinguish this fire.   If they should not, a sufficient guard will come, and you shall be all taken out and lodged in the compters. I assure you, upon my word and honour, that I have not a farthing insured.   I have left my house that I might take care of you. I will keep my promise, and stay with you, if you insist upon it; but if you will allow me to go out and look after my family and property, I shall be obliged to you.</QUOTE> Struck with his courage, truthfulness, and honourable sense of duty, the felons shouted <QUOTE>Master Akerman, you have done bravely. It was very kind of you. By <pb id="P.459" n="459">

Dr. Johnson said of this man, whom Wellington would have esteemed: <QUOTE>Sir, he who has long had constantly in view the worst of mankind, and is yet eminent for the humanity of his disposition, must have had it originally in a high degree, and continued to cultivate it very carefully.</QUOTE> 
<P>Great good was effected in Newgate by the Ladies' Prison Visiting Association, which commenced its labours among the female prisoners of Newgate in <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>. The Quakers had originated the movement, and it soon produced its effects. 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.459.2">Mrs. Fry</LEMMA> was the indefatigable leader of these philanthropists. The female prisoners in Newgate, before the good work began, were idle, abandoned, riotous, and drunken. There was no attempt at general inspection; the only distinction was between the tried and the untried. They slept promiscuously in large companies. Frequent communication was allowed them, through an iron grating, with visitors of both sexes, many of them more degraded and desperate than themselves. The good effected was rapid and palpable. The worst women became quiet, orderly, and industrious; the whole of them   grew   neater and cleaner; many learned to read; others sat for hours knitting with the ladies who visited Newgate. <num value="2">Two</num> of the committee, if possible, visited the prison daily, and observed the cases of the individual prisoners. The prisoners' patchwork, spinning, and knitting were sold for them, and, if possible, part of their earnings was put by, to accumulate for their benefit when they returned to the outer world. Schools were started for the children and the grown-up women. The governesses were chosen from the most intelligent, steady, and persevering of the prisoners. A careful system of supervision was also established. Over every <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="13">thirteen</num> women a matron was placed, who was answerable for their work, and kept an account of their conduct. A ward woman attended to the cleanliness of the wards. A yard woman maintained good order in the yard, and the sick room was ruled by a nurse and an assistant. These managers were all prisoners, selected from their orderly and respectable habits, and these situations became the best badge for good conduct. The female prisoners assembled every day in the committee-room, to hear the Bible read, or a prayer delivered, by the matron or <num value="1">one</num> of the visitors. The women, on being dismissed, says Mr. J. J. Gurney, returned to their several employments, with perfect order and obedience. The women grew very honest among themselves. In no less than <num value="100000">100,000</num> manufactured articles of work not <num value="1">one</num> article was stolen. The best proof of amelioration was the fact of the great decrease of re-commitments between <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct>. Many of the women kept under supervision by the committee preserved good characters as servants, or earned an honest livelihood at home. Several of the women, on discharge, received small loans, to help them on, and these loans they repaid by most punctual weekly instalments. At the end of <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>, Sir T. F. Buxton obtained a return of the re-commitments on the male side of Newgate, and it appeared that out of <num value="203">203</num> men <num value="47">47</num> of those convicted had been confined there before within the <num value="2">two</num> previous years. The returns on the female side, since the Ladies' Association had reformed the prison, were not more, as compared with the male side, than as <num value="4">4</num> to <num value="47">47</num>.   It had at <num value="1">one</num> time been as <num value="3">3</num> to <num value="5">5</num>. Can anything more be said to prove what a great good women may effect, who look upon female prisoners not as brute beasts, to be punished and despised, but as souls, to be won back and reclaimed? They softened these women's hearts, and tenderly restored them to humanity. The object of justice, in their eyes, was to reform, not merely to punish. Hence the kind look did more than the lash--the soft word than the hard fetter. The good work has, since those days, been carried further, and there is still much to do. 
<P>The <num value="1">first</num> memorable escape from Newgate was that of Jack Sheppard, a thievish young London carpenter, in <datestruct value="1724--"><year reg="1724">1724</year></datestruct>. This hero of modern thieves (mischievously immortalised by <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.460.1">Mr. Harrison Ainsworth</LEMMA>) had been condemned to death with a rogue named Blueskin, for stealing cloth from a Mr. Kneebone, a draper in the Strand, to whom <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.460.2">Sheppard</LEMMA> had formerly been apprenticed. The whole story of his adventures shows the loose discipline of Newgate at the time. Considering the lad was a practical carpenter and locksmith, and probably bribed the gaolers heavily, we see no great miracles in his escapes, which only needed cleverness, knowledge of wood and iron work, and steady perseverance. On the <num value="1">first</num> occasion Jack, during an interview with <num value="2">two</num> female friends in the lodge at Newgate, broke a spike off the hatch, and, by the assistance of the <num value="2">two</num> women, being slim and flexible, was pulled through the opening, and so escaped. Retaken at Finchley, the angry turnkeys gripped the young thief with handcuffs, loaded him with heavy irons (such as are still fastened above the side doors of the prison), and chained him to a stout staple in the floor of a strong room called <QUOTE>The Castle.</QUOTE> There people of all ranks came to <pb id="P.460" n="460"> see him, and all gave money to the young lion of the hour, but extreme care was taken that no sympathisers should pass him a chisel or a file. Jack was, however, eager for notoriety, and resolute to baffle the turnkeys. He chose a quiet afternoon, when most of the keepers were away with their amiable charges at the Old Bailey Sessions. With a small nail he had found he loosened his chain from the floor-staple, then slipped his small thievish hands through his handcuffs, and tied up his fetters as high as he could with his garters. With a piece of his broken chain he worked out of the chimney a transverse iron bar that stopped his upward progress. The keepers smoked and drank, and left Jack alone with mischief. Once on the airy roof, Jack, quick at breaking out of prisons, now tried his hand at breaking in, for, to force a way to the chapel, Jack broke into the Red Room, over the Castle, having found a large nail, with which he could work wonders. The Red Room door had not been unbolted for <num value="7">seven</num> long years. Jack forced off the lock in <num value="7">seven</num> short minutes, and got into a passage leading to the chapel. To force a strong bolt here, he broke a hole through the wall, and, with an. iron spike from the chapel door, opened a way between the chapel and the lower leads. <num value="3">Three</num> more doors flew open before him; over a wall, and he was on the upper leads. At this crisis, requiring a blanket, to tear up and make a rope for his descent, he had the courage to go back for it, all the way to his cell, and then, making a tough rope, he fastened it with the chapel spike, and let himself down on the leads of a turner, who lived adjoining the prison. Slipping in at a garret window, he stole softly down-stairs, and let himself out (a woman who heard his irons clink thought it was the cat). Passing the watchhouse of St. Sepulchre, he went up Gray's Inn Lane, and hid himself in a cow-house, near Tottenham Court. The next day he bribed a shoemaker to procure him a smith's hammer and a punch, and rid himself of his irons, the last souvenirs of Newgate. A few nights after, this incorrigible scamp broke into a pawnbroker's shop in Drury Lane, stole a sword and some coats, snuff-boxes, rings, and watches, and rigged himself out in black, with ruffled shirt, diamond ring, silver-hilted sword, gold watch, and other suitable garnishings. <num value="2">Two</num> nights afterwards, getting drunk with his mother near his old   haunts, the young thief was seized and thrown again into Newgate, no more to; escape. Sir James Thornhill painted his portrait in prison, and, after an unsuccessful plot to rescue him at Turnstile, he was hung at Tyburn. An opera and a farce were founded upon his adventures, and a preacher in the City is said to have thus spiritualised his career:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>Now, my beloved, what a melancholy consideration it is, that men should show so much regard for the preservation of a poor, perishing body, that can remain at most but a few years, and at the same time be so unaccountably negligent of a precious soul, which must continue to the ages of eternity! Oh, what care, what pains, what diligence, and what contrivances are made use of for, and laid out upon, these frail and tottering tabernacles of clay, when, alas! the nobler part of us is allowed so very small a share of our concern, that we scarce will give ourselves the trouble of bestowing a thought upon it. 
<P>We have a remarkable instance of this in a notorious malefactor, well known by the name of Jack Sheppard. What amazing difficulties has he overcome! what astonishing things has he performed, for the sake of a stinking, miserable carcase, hardly worth hanging! How dexterously did he pick the padlock of his chain with a crooked nail!   How manfully burst his fetters asunder, climb up the chimney, wrench out an iron bar, break his way through a stone wall, and make the strong door of a dark entry fly before him, till he got upon the leads of the prison! And then, fixing a blanket to the wall with a spike, how intrepidly did he descend to the top of the turner's house, and how cautiously pass down the stairs, and make his escape at the street-door! 
<P>Oh, that ye were all like Jack Sheppard! Mistake me not, my brethren; I don't mean in a carnal, but a spiritual sense; for I purpose to spiritualise these things. What a shame it would be, if we should not think it worth our while to take as much pains, and employ as many deep thoughts, to save our souls, as he has done to preserve his body! Let me exhort you, then, to open the locks of your hearts with the nail of repentance; burst asunder the fetters of your beloved lusts; mount the chimney of hope, take from thence the bar of good resolution; break through the stone wall of despair, and all the strongholds in the dark entry of the valley of the shadow of death; raise yourselves to the leads of divine meditation; fix the blanket of faith with the spike of the Church;--let yourselves down to the turner's house of resignation, and descend the stairs of humility. So shall you come to the door of deliverance from the prison of iniquity, and escape the clutches of that old executioner, the devil, who  <Q>goeth about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.</Q> </QUOTE>
 
<P>The condition of things in ancient Newgate was deplorable. When the contagious fever broke out, <pb id="P.461" n="461"> there were no less than <num value="800">800</num> prisoners crowded within the walls. It was not till <datestruct value="1810"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct> that, through the exertions of Sir Richard Phillips, a Committee of the Common. Council passed a resolution for building a new prison for debtors, and in <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct> the debtors were transferred from Newgate to the Giltspur Street Compter. In a Parliamentary Report of <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, the following statement appeared of the way in which the chaplain's duties were performed:-- <QUOTE>Beyond his attendance at chapel, and on those who are sentenced to death Dr. Ford feels but few duties to be attached to his office.   He knows nothing of the state of morals in the prison; he never sees any of the prisoners in private. Though <num value="14">fourteen</num> boys and girls from <num value="9">nine</num> to <num value="13">thirteen</num> years old were in Newgate in April last, he does not consider attention to them a point of his duty. He never knows that any have been sick till he gets a warning to attend their funeral; and does not go to the infirmary, for it is not in his instructions.</QUOTE> The prisoners were allowed to drink and gamble, and their amusement was the repeating stories of past villany and debauchery, <QUOTE>I scruple not to affirm,</QUOTE> says Howard, <QUOTE>that half the robberies committed in and around   London are planned in the prisons by that dreadful assemblage of criminals, and the number of idle people who visit them.</QUOTE> Those who refused to associate with the criminals were submitted to mock trial, in which the oldest thief acted as judge, with a towel, tied in knots on each side of his head, for a wig; and he had officers to put his sentences into execution. <QUOTE>Garnish,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>footing,</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>chummage,</QUOTE> was   demanded of all new prisoners. <QUOTE>Pay, or strip,</QUOTE> was the order; and the prisoner without money had to part with some of his clothes, to contribute towards the expense of a revel; the older prisoners adding something to the <QUOTE>garnish</QUOTE> paid by the new comer. The practice of the prisoners cooking their own food had not been long discontinued in <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Even in <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct> the Inspector of Prisons found fault with the system within the prison. The prisoners were allowed to amuse themselves with gambling, card-playing, and draughts; sometimes they obtained, by stealth, says a writer in Knight's 
<title>London,</title> the luxury of tobacco, and a newspaper. Sometimes they could get drunk. Instruments to facilitate prison-breaking were found in the prison. Combs and towels were not provided, and the supply of soap was insufficient.   In their Report of <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>, the inspectors say, <QUOTE>It has been our painful duty, again and again, to point attention to the serious evils resulting from gaol association, and consequent necessary contamination in this prison. The importance of this prison, in this point of view, is very great. As the great metropolitan prison for the untried, it is here that those most skilled in crime of every form, those whom the temptations, the excesses, and the experience of this great city have led through a course of crime to the highest skill in the arts of depredation, and the lowest degradation of infamy, meet together with those who are new to such courses, and who are only too ready to learn how they may pursue the career they have just entered upon with most security from detection and punishment, and with greater success and indulgence. The numbers committed (nearly <num value="4000">4,000</num> per annum), which are still increasing, render this a subject of still greater moment.</QUOTE>

<P>There is some dispute as to the origin of the name <QUOTE>Old Bailey,</QUOTE> for while some think it implies the Ballium, or outer space beyond the wall, Maitland refers it to Bail Hill, an eminence where the bail, or bailiff, lived and held his court.   Stow thinks the street was called from   some old court held there, as, in the year <datestruct value="1356"><year reg="1356">1356</year></datestruct>, the tenement and ground upon Houndsditch, between Ludgate on the south and Newgate on the north, was appointed to John   Cambridge, fishmonger and Chamberlain of London, <QUOTE>whereby,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>it seems that the Chamberlains of London   have there kept their courts as now they do by the Guildhall; and to this day the mayor and justices of this City kept <pb id="P.462" n="462">

<P>Strype describes the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.462.2">Old Sessions House</LEMMA> as a fair and stately building, very commodious, and with large galleries on both sides for spectators, <QUOTE>the court-room,</QUOTE> he remarks, <QUOTE>being advanced by stone steps from the ground, with rails and banisters, enclosed from the yard before it; and the bail-dock, which fronts the court where the prisoners are kept until brought to their trials, is also inclosed. Over the court-room is a stately diningroom, sustained by <num value="10">ten</num> stone pillars, and over it a platform, headed with rails and banisters. There be <num value="5">five</num> lodging-rooms, and other conveniences, on either side the court.

<P>Under the general title, <QUOTE>The Central Criminal Court,</QUOTE> are joined both what are called the Old Court and the New. The former deals with the more weighty cases-those of deepest dye-and has echoed, without doubt, to more tales of the romance of crime than any other building in the kingdom. 
<P> <QUOTE>The judges of the Central Criminal Court,</QUOTE> says Mr. Timbs (<datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE>are the Lord Mayor(who opens the court), the Sheriffs, the Lord Chancellor (such is the order of the Act), the Judges, the Aldermen, Recorder, Common Serjeant of London, Judge of the Sheriff's Court, or City Commissioner, and any others whom the Crown may appoint as assistants.   Of these the Recorder and Common Serjeant are in reality the presiding judges; a judge of the law only assisting when unusual points of the law are involved, or when conviction affects the life of the prisoner. Here are tried crimes of every kind, from treason to the pettiest larceny, and even offences committed on the high seas. The jurisdiction comprises the whole of the metropolis as now defined; with the remainder of Middlesex; the parishes of Richmond and Mortlake, in Surrey; and great part of Essex.</QUOTE> 
<P>The court is regulated by Act of Parliament <num value="4">4</num> and <num value="5">5</num> Will. IV., c. <num value="36">36</num>. 
<P>As to the number of persons who are brought here into public notice, Mr. Sheriff Laurie, writing to the <title>Times</title> of <datestruct VALUE="1845-11-28"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1845>1845</year></datestruct> says, <QUOTE>I find upon investigation that upwards of <num value="2000">two thousand</num> persons annually are placed at the bar of the Old Bailey for trial. About <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3">third</num> are acquitted, <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3">third</num> are <num value="1">first</num> offences, and the remaining portion have been convicted of felony before.</QUOTE> 
<P>Trials are going on at the Old Bailey almost all the year round. Frequent, however, as they are, there are occasional pauses. Justice, it has been said, must nod sometimes, and therefore it is as well to provide for fitting repose elsewhere than on the judgment-seat.   The sittings of the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.464.2">Central Criminal Court</LEMMA> are held monthly, but as the whole of the month is not occupied in the trial of the prisoners on the calendar, the spare time forms a vacation, and such are the only vacations at the Old Bailey. In consequence of these frequent sittings, trials are often conducted and prisoners rewarded according to their merits, with surprising swiftness. A criminal may be guilty of theft in the morning, be apprehended before night, be committed by a magistrate the next day, and the day after that be tried, convicted, and sentenced at the Old Bailey--a speedy administration of justice, which must be highly gratifying to all concerned. 
<P> <QUOTE>The usual defence of a thief, especially at the Old Bailey,</QUOTE> says Fielding, writing of the increase of robbers, <QUOTE>is an <hi rend=italics>alibi</hi>. To prove this by perjury is a common act of Newgate friendship; and there seldom is any difficulty in procuring such witnesses. I remember a felon, within this twelvemonth, to have been proved to be in Ireland at the time when the robbery was sworn to have been done in London, and acquitted; but he was scarce gone from the bar, when the witness was himself arrested for a robbery committed in London, at that very time when he   swore both he and his friend were in Dublin; for which robbery I think he was tried and executed.</QUOTE> 
<P>The interior of the Old Court, which, naturally enough, from every point of view is more interesting than that of the New <num value="1">one</num>, has been described in a lively manner by a writer in Knight's <title>Cyclopaedia of London</title> (<datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>). <QUOTE>Passing,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>through a door in the wall which encloses the area between Newgate and the courts, we find a flight of steps on our right, leading up into the Old Court. This is used chiefly for prosecutors and witnesses. Farther on in the area, another flight of steps leads to a long passage into a corridor at the back of the court, with <num value="2">two</num> doors opening into the latter, by <num value="1">one</num> of which the judges and sheriffs reach the bench, and by the other, the barristers their place in the centre at the bottom.   Both doors also lead to seats reserved for visitors. We enter, pause, and look round. The <num value="1">first</num> sentiment is <num value="1">one</num> of disappointment.   The great and moral power and pre-eminence of the court makes <num value="1">one</num>, however idly and   unconsciously, anticipate a grander physical exhibition.   What does meet our gaze is no more than a square hall of sufficient length, and breadth, and height, lighted up by <num value="3">three</num> large square windows on the opposite wall, showing the top of the gloomy walls of Newgate, having on the left a gallery close to the ceiling, with projecting boxes, and on the right, the bench, extending the whole length of the wall, with desks at intervals for the use of the judges, whilst in the body of the court are, <num value="1">first</num>, a dock for the prisoners below the gallery, with stairs descending to the covered passage by which prisoners are conveyed to and from the prison; then, just in advance of the left-hand corner of the dock, the circular witness-box, and in a similarly relative position to the witness-box, the jury-box, below the windows of the court, an arrangement that enables the jury to see clearly and without turning, the faces of the witnesses and of the prisoners; that enables the witness to identify the prisoner; and lastly, that enables the judges on the bench, and the counsel in the centre of the court below, to keep jury, witnesses, and prisoners <pb id="P.465" n="465"> all at once within the same, or nearly the same, line of view. We need only add to these features of the place the formidable row of law-books which occupies the centre of the green-baized table, around which are the counsel, reminding us of the passage in the <title>Beggars' Opera</title>-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>The charge is prepared, the lawyers are met, 
<L>The judges all ranged, a terrible show;</QUOTE>
 the double line of reporters occupying the <num value="2">two</num> seats below us; the sheriff in attendance for the day, looking so spruce in his court suit, stepping noiselessly in and out; and lastly the goodly personage in the blue and furred robes and gold chain, who sits in the centre on the chief seat, with the gilded sword of justice suspended over his head against the crimson-lined wall.   Some abstruse document, apparently, just now engages his attention, for he appears utterly absorbed in it, bending over his desk.  <QUOTE>It must surely be the Lord Chancellor come to try some great case,</QUOTE>  thinks many an innocent spectator; but he rises, and we perceive it is only an ex-mayor reading the newspaper of the day. But we forgot: Hazlitt said that a City apprentice who did not esteem the Lord Mayor the greatest man in the world, would come some day to be hanged; and here everybody apparently is of the same opinion.  <QUOTE>Who, then, is the judge?</QUOTE>  <num value="1">one</num> naturally asks; when, looking more attentively, we perceive for the <num value="1">first</num> time, beyond the representative of civic majesty, which thus asserts its rights, some <num value="1">one</num> writing, taking frequent but brief glances at the prisoners or the witnesses, but never turning his head in any other direction, speaking to no <num value="1">one</num> on the bench, unspoken to. That is a judge of the land, quietly doing the whole business of the court.</QUOTE> The court formerly sat at the early hour of <num value="7">7</num> a.m. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, both the Old Court and the New Court were ventilated, upon Dr. Reid's plan, from chambers beneath the floors, filled with air filtered from an apartment outside the building, the air being drawn into them by an enormous discharge upon the highest part of the edifice, or propelled into them by a fanner. From the entire building the vitiated air is received in a large chamber in the roof of the Old Court, whence it is discharged by a gigantic iron cowl, <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet in diameter, weighing <num value="2">two</num> tons, and the point of the arrow of the guiding vane weighing <measure value="150l." type=currency><num value="150">150</num> pounds</measure>. The subterrannean air-tunnels pass through a portion of the old City wall. 
<P>It was at the Old Bailey, in <datestruct value="1727--"><year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct>, that Richard Savage, the dissolute poet, for whom Dr. Johnson seems to have felt an affection, was tried. The poet was out, <num value="1">one</num> night, drinking and rioting with <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen named Merchant and Gregory, when they agreed to turn in at <QUOTE>Robinson's</QUOTE> Coffee House, near Charing Cross. Merchant, demanding a room in a bullying way, was told there was a fire ready-made in the next partition, where the company were about to leave. The <num value="3">three</num> men at once rushed in, and placed themselves between the fire and the persons who were there, and kicked down a table. A fight ensued, and Savage ran a Mr. James. Sinclair through the body. He also wounded a servant-girl who tried to hold him, and broke his way out of the house. He was taken, however, in a back court, where some soldiers had come to his assistance. The next morning the <num value="3">three</num> revellers were carried before the justices, who sent them to the Gate House, and on the death of Mr. Sinclair they were removed to Newgate. They were not, however, chained, and were placed apart from the vulgar herd in the press-yard. It was proved that the fatal stab was given by Savage, and he was consequently found guilty of murder. It is said that his supposed mother, the Countess of Macclesfield, did all she could to bring Savage to the gallows; but the Countess of Hertford, Lord Tyrconnel, and Mrs. Oldfield, the actress, obtained for him at last the king's pardon.

<P>But besides those criminals, outcasts of society, and notorious for their evil deeds, the Old Bailey has disposed of another class, distinguished by their noble and elevated principles, and famed for their patriotism. Here were tried, in <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, immediately after the Restoration, those of the judges of Charles I. who were still alive, and, relying on the promised bill of indemnity, had remained in England; and <num value="23">twenty-three</num> years later, in the same reign, a nobleman whose name has become a household word--in connection with his illustrious friend, Sidney-Lord William Russell. 
<P>The trial of the regicides commenced on the <datestruct VALUE="1660-10-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, before a court of <num value="34">thirty-four</num> commissioners, of whom some were old royalists; others, such as Manchester, Say, Annesley, and Hollis, had been all members of the Long Parliament; and with these sat Monk, Montague, and Cooper, the associates of Cromwell, who, <num value="1">one</num> would think, from motives of delicacy, would have withheld from the tribunal. The prisoners were <num value="29">twenty-nine</num> in number, and included Sir Hardress Waller, Major-General Harrison, Colonel Carew, Cook, Hugh Peters, Scott, Harry Marten, and Scroop, among other scarcely less noticeable names. Waller was <num value="1">first</num> called; he pleaded guilty, and thus escaped the scaffold. Harrison's turn came next. Animated by a fervid spirit of enthusiasm, perfectly free from all alloy of worldly motives, he spoke boldly in his defence. <QUOTE>Maybe I might be a little mistaken,</QUOTE> said he, <QUOTE>but I did it all according to the best of my understanding, desiring to make the revealed will of God in His Holy Scriptures as a guide to me. I humbly conceive that what was done was done in the name of the Parliament of England--that what was done was done by their power and authority; and I do humbly conceive it is my duty to offer unto you in the beginning, that this court, or any court below the High Court of Parliament, hath no jurisdiction of their actions.</QUOTE> His boldness could not save him; he was sentenced to death, and retired saying he had no reason to be ashamed of the cause in which he had been engaged.   Colonel Carew's frame of mind was in tune with that of Harrison, and he also was condemned to death.   Harry Marten began a most ingenious and persevering defence by taking exception to the indictment. He declared he was not even mentioned in it! It certainly included a name, Henry Marten, but that was not his-his was <hi rend=italics>Harry</hi> Marten. This was overruled, and the trial proceeded. The Solicitor-General having said, <QUOTE>I am sorry to see in you so little repentance,</QUOTE> Marten replied, <QUOTE>My lord, if it were possible for that blood to be in the body again, and every drop that was shed in the late wars, I could wish it with all my heart; but, my lord, I hope it is lawful to offer in my defence that which, when I did it, I thought I might do. My lord, there was a House of Commons as I understood it: perhaps your lordship thinks it was not a House of Commons, but it was then the supreme authority of England; it was so reputed both at home and abroad.</QUOTE> He then went on to plead that the statute of Henry VIII. exempted from high treason any <num value="1">one</num> acting under a king <hi rend=italics>de facto</hi>, though he should not be a king <hi rend=italics>de jure</hi>.   No arguments would move the Old Bailey judge and jury of that day. Marten also was condemned. As for the other prisoners, all of them were found guilty, but those who had surrendered themselves voluntarily were, with <num value="1">one</num> exception, that of Scroop, respited. <num value="10">Ten</num> were executed. All, it has been remarked, died with the constancy of martyrs, and it is to be observed that not a single man of those who had a share in the death of the late king seems to have voluntarily repented of the deed. .<P>It was at the trial of the regicides that the ridiculous story was <num value="1">first</num> given in evidence by a soldier, who declared that when Harry Marten and Cromwell signed the death-warrant of the king, they wiped their pens on each other's faces. 
<P>The trial of Lord William Russell for his alleged connection with the Rye House Plot commenced at the Old Bailey on the <datestruct VALUE="1683-07-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>. He was charged with conspiring the death of the king, and consulting how to levy war against him. As was the case in. the trial of the regicides, there is no doubt that the jury was packed by the sheriffs. Lord Russell desired the postponement of the trial <pb id="P.467" n="467"> till the afternoon, on account of an error in the list of the jury, and of the non-arrival of some witnesses from the country. The Attorney-General, Sir Robert Sawyer, corruptly assuming his guilt as already proven, answered harshly, <QUOTE>You would not have given the king an hour's notice for saving his life; the trial must proceed.</QUOTE> Desiring to take notes of the evidence, the prisoner asked if he might have assistance. <QUOTE>Yes a servant,</QUOTE> said Sir Robert D. Pemberton, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, who presided, adding, <QUOTE>any of your servants shall assist you in writing anything you please for you.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>My lord,</QUOTE> was the answer, <QUOTE>my wife is here to do it.</QUOTE> No wonder that a thrill ran through the crowd of spectators when they saw the daughter of the excellent and popular Lord Southampton thus bravely aiding her husband in his defence The incident was not likely to be forgotten, and both painters and poets have long delighted to dwell on the image 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Of that sweet saint who sat by Russell's side.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Every <num value="1">one</num> knows how the trial ended, and how the unfortunate but noble-minded Russell was, on the <datestruct value="07-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, executed in Lincoln's Inn Fields. 
<P>The Press-Yard at the Old Bailey still, by its name, commemorates <num value="1">one</num> of the cruelties of our old statute-book. In all cases where a criminal refused to plead at the bar, in order to preserve his property from being forfeited to, the Crown, the 
<hi rend=italics>peine forte et dure</hi> was used. The most celebrated case of the application of this torture was in <datestruct value="1659--"><year reg="1659">1659</year></datestruct>, when Major Strangways endured   it, to save his estate. He and his elder sister had shared a farm peacefully enough, til the sister married a lawyer named Fussell, whom   Strangways disliked.   He had been, indeed, heard to say that if ever his sister married Fussell, he would be the death of him in his study, or elsewhere.   <num value="1">One</num> day Fussell was shot at his lodgings in London, and suspicion fell on Strangways, who consented to the ordeal of touch. At his trial Strangways refused to plead. He wished to bestow his estate on his best friends, and he hoped to escape the ignominy of the gibbet. Lord Chief Justice Glynn then passed the sentence, <QUOTE>That he be put into a mean house, stopped from any light, and be laid upon his back, with his body bare; that his arms be stretched forth with a cord, the <num value="1">one</num> to <num value="1">one</num> side, the other to the other side of the prison, and in like manner his legs be used ; and that upon his body be laid as much iron and stone as he can bear, and more.   The <num value="1">first</num> day he shall have <num value="3">three</num> morsels of barley bread, and the next he shall drink thrice of the water in the next channel to the prison door, but of no spring or fountain water; and this shall be his punishment till he die.</QUOTE> 
<P>On the Monday following Strangways was clothed in white from top to toe, and wearing a mourning cloak (for indeed it was his own funeral to which he was going).   His friends placed themselves at the corner of the press, and when he. gave the word, put on the weights. This was done till he uttered the words, <QUOTE>Lord. Jesus, receive my soul,</QUOTE> but the weight being too light to produce instant death, those present stood on the board, as a ghastly and last act of friendship. The poor fellow bore this some <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> minutes. 
<P>After the almost entire abolition of this cruel practice, it was the custom to force the prisoners to plead, if possible, by screwing the thumb with whipcord, a sort of buccaneer form of cruelty. In <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct> Mary Andrews was tortured thus.   The <num value="1">first</num> <num value="3">three</num> whipcords broke, but she gave way with the <num value="4">fourth</num>. The same year (for the press was still partially continued) the cord was tried <num value="1">first</num> on a criminal named Nathaniel Hawes, who then was pressed under a weight of <measure value="250l." type=currency><num value="250">250</num> pounds</measure>, and he consented to plead. According to <num value="1">one</num> writer on the subject, the cord torture was last used about <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>. 
<P>A tragic episode in the history of the administration of justice in the Old Bailey was the invasion of the court by the gaol-fever during the sessions of <datestruct VALUE="1750-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>.   The gaol-fever raged so violently in the neighbouring prison that the effluvia, entering the court, caused the death of the Judge of the Common Pleas, Sir Thomas Abney, Baron Clark, Pennant the historian's <QUOTE>respected kinsman,</QUOTE> Sir Samuel Pennant, Lord Mayor, and several members of the Bar and of the jury. 
<P>The occasion of this misadventure, and a few particulars concerning it, have been recorded for the benefit of posterity. A Captain Clarke was being tried for killing a Captain Turner, and the court was unusually crowded. About <num value="100">one hundred</num> prisoners were tried, and they were kept all day cooped up in <num value="2">two</num> small rooms <num value="14">14</num> feet by <num value="11">11</num> feet each way, and only <num value="7">7</num> feet high. It was remarked that the Lord Chief Justice and the Recorder, who sat on the Lord Mayor's right hand, caught, while the rest of the bench, on the left, escaped, the infection. This was attributed to the draught, that carried the infected air in that direction.   Every precaution was afterwards taken, says Pennant, to keep the court airy; but as several of these fatal accidents had already happened in the kingdom, it was rather surprising <QUOTE>that the neglect of the salutary precautions was continued till the time of this awakening call.</QUOTE> The disease again proved fatal to several in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>. <pb id="P.468" n="468"> 
<P>Upon the <num value="1">first</num> outbreak of the gaol-fever the custom arose of placing rue in front of the dock of the Old Bailey to prevent infection: so it is stated in Lawrence's <title>Life of Fielding </title> (<datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>). At the trial of Manning and his wife for murder, it will be remembered that at the conclusion of a speech by <num value="1">one</num> of the counsel, Mrs. Manning gathered some of <QUOTE>the sprigs of rue placed on the dock,</QUOTE> and threw them vehemently over the wigged heads of the <QUOTE>learned</QUOTE> gentlemen. 
<P>Over the court-room is a dining-room, where the judges have long been in the habit of dining when the court was over--a practice commemorated by a well-known line-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>And wretches hang that jurymen may dine.</QUOTE>
 
<P> <QUOTE>If we are not misinformed,</QUOTE> says an amusing writer in the <title>Quarterly Review</title> for <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>the fiat has gone forth already against <num value="1">one</num> class of City dinners, which was altogether peculiar of its kind. We allude to the dinner given by the sheriffs during the Old Bailey sittings to the judges and aldermen in attendance, the Recorder, Common Serjeant, City pleaders, and occasionally a few members of the Bar. The <num value="1">first</num> course was rather miscellaneous, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.468" n="2000.07.0167"><HEAD><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.468.1">Front Of Newgate From The Old Bailey</LEMMA>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 and   varied   with the season, though marrowpuddings always formed a part of it; the <num value="2">second</num> never varied, and consisted exclusively of beefsteaks.   The custom   was to serve <num value="2">two</num> dinners (exact duplicates) a day, the <num value="1">first</num> at <num value="3">three</num> o'clock, the <num value="2">second</num> at <num value="5">five</num>. As the judges relieved each other it was impracticable for them to partake of both; but the aldermen often did so, and the chaplain, whose duty it was to preside at the lower end of the table, was never absent from his post. This invaluable public servant persevered from a sheer sense of duty, till he had acquired the habit of eating <num value="2">two</num> dinners a day, and practised it for nearly <num value="10">ten</num> years without any perceptible injury to his health. We had the pleasure of witnessing his performances at <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="5">five</num> o'clock dinners, and can assert with confidence, that the vigour of his attack on the beef-steaks was wholly unimpaired by the effective execution a friend assured us he had done on them <num value="2">two</num> hours before. The occasion to which we allude was so remarkable for other reasons, that we have the most distinct recollection of the circumstances. It was the <num value="1">first</num> trial of the late St. John Long for rubbing a young lady into her grave. The presiding judges were Mr. Justice Park <pb id="P.469" n="469"> and Mr. Baron Garrow, who retired to dinner about <num value="5">five</num>, having <num value="1">first</num> desired the jury, amongst whom there was a difference of opinion, to be locked up. The dinner proceeded merrily, the beef-steaks were renewed again and again, and received the solemn sanction of judicial approbation repeatedly. Mr. Adolphus told some of his best stories, and the chaplain was on the point of being challenged for a song, when the court-keeper appeared with a face of consternation, to announce that the jury, after being very noisy for an hour or so, had sunk into a dull, dead lull, which, to the experienced in such matters, augurs the longest period of deliberation which the heads, or rather stomachs, of the jury can endure. The trial had, unfortunately, taken place upon a Saturday, and it became a serious question in what manner the refractory jurymen were to be dealt with. Mr. Baron Garrow proposed waiting till within a few minutes of <num value="12">twelve</num>, and then discharging them. Mr. Justice Park, the senior judge, and a warm   admirer of the times when refractory juries were carried round the country in a cart, would hear of no expedient of the kind. He said a judge was not bound to wait beyond a reasonable hour at night, nor to attend before a reasonable hour in the morning; that Sunday was a <hi rend=italics>dies non</hi> in law, and that a verdict must be delivered in the presence of the judge. He consequently declared his intention of waiting till what 
<FIGURE id="Fig.469" n="2000.07.0168"><HEAD>Surgeons' Hall, Old Bailey, <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 he deemed a reasonable hour-namely, about tenand then informing the jury that, if they were not agreed, they must be locked up without fire or candle until a reasonable hour (about <num value="9">nine</num>) on the Monday, by which time he trusted they would be unanimous. The effect of such an intimation was not put to the test, for Mr. St. John Long was found guilty about <num value="9">nine</num>.   We are sorry to be. obliged to add that the worthy chaplain's digestion has at length proved unequal to the double burthen imposed upon it; but the Court of Aldermen, considering him a martyr to their cause, have very properly agreed to grant him an adequate pension for his services.</QUOTE>

<P>The Old Bailey--that part of the street opposite to Newgate-became the scene of public executions in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>, on the <datestruct value="12-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct> in which year the <num value="1">first</num> culprit suffered here the extreme <pb id="P.470" n="470"> penalty of the law. Before that time the public executions ordinarily took place at Tyburn. The gallows of the Old Bailey was built with <num value="3">three</num> cross-beams for as many rows of victims, and between February and <datestruct VALUE="1785-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>, <num value="96">ninety-six</num> persons suffered by the <QUOTE>new drop,</QUOTE> an ingenious invention which took the place of the cart.   On but <num value="1">one</num> occasion the old mode of execution was revived; a triangular gallows was set up in the road, opposite Green Arbour Court, and the cart was drawn from under the criminal's feet. 
<P>The front of Newgate continued to be the place of execution in London from <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>, when an Act was passed directing executions to take place within the walls of prisons.   This Act was the result of a commission on capital punishments, appointed in <datestruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct>, which, in their report issued in <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>, recommended, amongst other things, that executions should not be public. The number of executions throughout the country has been gradually decreasing for many years, as our laws have become less severe.   In <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct> there were fortythree executions in London; in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>,   <num value="17">seventeen</num>; in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, <num value="6">six</num>; in <datestruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct>; none; in <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>, none; in <datestruct value="1837--"><year reg="1837">1837</year></datestruct>, <num value="2">two</num>; in <datestruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>, none; in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>, <num value="2">two</num>; in <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, <num value="1">one</num>; in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>, <num value="2">two</num>; in <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>, none; in <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>, <num value="1">one</num>; in <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>, <num value="3">three</num>; in <datestruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct>, <num value="2">two</num>; and from <datestruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct> the average has been <num value="148">148</num> per annum. What a contrast this presents to the stern old times when the law of the gallows and the scaffold kept our forefathers in order! In the reign of Henry VIII. --<num value="38">thirty-eight</num> years--it is said that no fewer than <num value="72000">72,000</num> criminals were executed in England! 
<P>It used to be occasionally the usage to execute the criminal near the scene of his guilt. Those who were punished capitally for the riots of <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct> suffered in those parts of the town in which their crimes were committed; and in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct> <num value="2">two</num> incendiaries were hanged in Aldersgate Street, at the eastern end of Long Lane, opposite the site of the house to which they had set fire. <QUOTE>Since that period,</QUOTE> Mr. Timbs observes, <QUOTE>there have been few executions in London except in front of Newgate. The last deviation from the regular course was in the case of the sailor Cashman, who was hung in <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>, in Skinner Street, opposite the house of Mr. Beckwith, the gunsmith, which he had plundered.</QUOTE> 
<P>About <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct> was witnessed in the Old Bailey the end of an old practice: the body of the criminal just executed was burned for the last time. A woman was the sufferer in this case. She was hung on a low gibbet, and on life being extinct, fagots were heaped around her and over her head, fire was set to the pile, and the corpse was burned to ashes. 
<P>The memorable executions at the Old Bailey include those of Mrs. Phepoe, for murder, <datestruct VALUE="1797-12-11"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=11>11</day>, <year reg=1797>1797</year></datestruct>; Holloway and Haggerty, <datestruct VALUE="1807-02-23"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=23>23rd</day>, <year reg=1807>1807</year></datestruct>; Bellingham, <datestruct VALUE="1812-05-18"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=18>18th</day>, <year reg=1812>1812</year></datestruct>; Joseph Hunton (Quaker), <datestruct VALUE="1828-12-8"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=8>8th</day>, <year reg=1828>1828</year></datestruct>; Bishop and Williams, <datestruct VALUE="1831-12-5"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=5>5</day>, <year reg=1831>1831</year></datestruct>; John Pegsworth, <datestruct VALUE="1837-03-7"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=7>7th</day>, <year reg=1837>1837</year></datestruct>; James Greenacre, <datestruct VALUE="1837-05-2"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=2>2</day>, <year reg=1837>1837</year></datestruct>; besides several others already mentioned by us as having undergone trial at the adjoining court of justice. 
<P>A   dreadful accident took place here at the execution of Holloway and Haggerty, on the <datestruct VALUE="1807-02-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, for the murder of Mr. Steele, on Hounslow Heath, in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>.   <num value="28">Twenty-eight</num> persons were crushed to death. We have already alluded to the circumstances, and to our previous notice the following account of the catastrophe, by a writer in the <title>Annual Register</title>, must be regarded as supplementary:-- <QUOTE>On the north side of the Old Bailey, the multitude to see the execution was so immensely great that, in their movements, they were not inaptly compared to the flow and reflow of the waves of the, sea, when in troubled motion.   In the centre of this vast concourse of people was placed a cart, in which persons were accommodated with standing-places to see the culprits; but, it is supposed from the circumstance of too many being admitted into it, the axle-tree gave way, and by the concussion many persons were killed. Unhappily, the mischief did not stop here.   A temporary chasm in the crowd being thus made by the fall of the cart, many persons rushed forward to get upon the body of it, which formed a kind of platform, from which they thought they could get a commanding view over the heads of the persons in front. All those who, from choice or necessity, were nearest to the cart, strove to get upon it; and in their eagerness drove   those in front headforemost among the crowd beneath, by whom they were trampled under foot, without the power of relieving them.   The latter in turn were in like manner assailed, and shared the same fate. This dreadful scene continued for some time. The shrieks of the dying men, women, and children were terrific beyond description, and could only be equalled by the horror of the event.</QUOTE> The most affecting scene of distress was seen at Green Arbour Court, nearly opposite the Debtors' Door. 
<P>Offenders frequently stood in the pillory in the Old Bailey, and there, no doubt, were often, as was customary, stoned by the mob, and pelted with rotten eggs, and other equally   offensive missiles.   The pillory generally consisted of a wooden frame, erected on a scaffolding, with holes <pb id="P.471" n="471"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.471.1">Pillory near London Bridge</LEMMA></NOTE>
 and folding boards for the admission of the head and hands of him whom it was desired to render thus publicly infamous.   Rushworth says that it was invented for the special benefit of mountebanks and quacks, <QUOTE>who having gotten upon banks and forms to abuse the people, were exalted in the same kind,</QUOTE> but it seems to have been freely used for cheats of all description.   Bakers for making bread of light weight, and <QUOTE>dairymen for selling mingled butter,</QUOTE> were in the olden time <QUOTE>sharply corrected</QUOTE> upon it. So also were fraudulent corn, coal, and cattle dealers, cutters of purses, sellers of sham gold rings, keepers of infamous houses, forgers of letters, bonds, and deeds, counterfeits of papal bulls, users of unstamped measures, and forestallers of the markets. But just as the Old Bailey Court witnessed occasionally the persecution of the innocent, so the pillory had at <num value="1">one</num> time other heroes than cheats, thieves, scandalmongers, and perjurers. <QUOTE>Thanks to Archbishop Laud, and Star Chamber tyrants,</QUOTE> says the late Dr. Robert Chambers, <QUOTE>it figured so conspicuously in the political and polemical disputes which heralded the downfall of the monarchy, as to justify a writer of our own time in saying,  <Q> Noble hearts had been tried and tempered in it; daily had been elevated in it mental independence, manly self-reliance, robust, athletic endurance. All from within that has undying worth it had but more plainly exposed to public gaze from without.</Q> </QUOTE> Many a courageous and outspoken thinker will occur to every reader of English history as having been set on this scaffold of infamy, to the lasting disgrace of narrow-minded tyranny. 
<P>The last who stood in the pillory of London was Peter James Bossy, tried for perjury, and sentenced to transportation for <num value="7">seven</num> years. Previous to being transported he was to be kept for <num value="6">six</num> months in Newgate, and to stand for <num value="1">one</num> hour in the pillory in the Old Bailey. The pillory part of the sentence was executed on the <datestruct VALUE="1830-06-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>. 
<P>An Act of the British Parliament, dated <datestruct VALUE="1837-06-30"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=30>30</day>, <year reg=1837>1837</year></datestruct>, put an end to the use of the pillory in the United Kingdom.   In <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct> it had been abolished as a punishment except for perjury. 
<P>The Surgeons' Hall stood in the Old Bailey, on the site of the New Sessions House, till <datestruct value="1809"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>. Pennant, in his <title>London,</title> remarks, in connection with the old Court of Justice, that the erection of the Surgeons' Hall in its neighbourhood was an exceedingly convenient circumstance. <QUOTE>By a sort of <num value="2">second</num> sight,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>the Surgeons' Theatre was built near this court of conviction and Newgate, the concluding stage of the lives forfeited to the justice of their country, several years before the fatal tree was removed from Tyburn td its present site. It is a handsome building, ornamented with Ionic pilasters, and with a double flight of steps to the <num value="1">first</num> floor. Beneath is a door for the admission of the bodies of murderers and other felons, who, noxious in their lives, make a sort of reparation to their fellow-creatures by becoming useful after death.</QUOTE> 
<P>The bodies of murderers, after execution, were dissected in the Surgeons' Theatre, according to an Act passed in <datestruct value="1752--"><year reg="1752">1752</year></datestruct>, and which was only repealed in the reign of William IV. A curious experiment was performed here, in the beginning of the century, on the body of <num value="1">one</num> Foster, who was executed for the murder of his wife. It was <QUOTE>lately,</QUOTE> says a writer in the <title>Annual Register</title> for <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>subjected to the galvanic process, by Mr. Aldini (a nephew of Galvani), in presence of Mr. Keate, Mr. Carpue, and several other professional gentlemen. On the <num value="1">first</num> application of the process to the face, the jaw of the deceased criminal began to quiver, and the adjoining muscles were horribly contorted, and <num value="1">one</num> eye actually opened. In a subsequent course of the experiment, the right hand was raised and clenched, and the legs and thighs were set in motion; and it appeared to all the bystanders that the wretched man was on the point of being restored to life! The object of these experiments was to show the excitability of the human frame when animal electricity is duly applied; and the possibility of its being efficaciously used in cases of drowning, suffocation, or apoplexy, by reviving the action of the lungs, and thereby rekindling the expiring spark of vitality.</QUOTE> But the most curious part of the proceedings remains to be told. According to Mr. J. Saunders, in Knight's <title>London,</title>
 <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>, when the right arm was raised, as mentioned above, it struck <num value="1">one</num> of the officers of the institution, who died that very afternoon of the shock. 
<P>In <datestruct VALUE="1760-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>, Laurence Earl Ferrers was tried before the House of Lords, for the murder of his steward. He was found guilty, and sentenced <QUOTE>to be hanged by the neck till he was dead; after which his body was to be delivered to Surgeons' Hall, to be dissected and anatomised.</QUOTE> At the latter part of the sentence, we are told, his lordship cried out, <QUOTE>God forbid!</QUOTE> but, soon recollecting himself, added, <QUOTE>God's will be done!</QUOTE> On Monday, the <datestruct value="05-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, he was hanged at Tyburn, and the body was conveyed, with some state, in his own landau and <num value="6">six</num>, to the Surgeons' Hall, in the Old Bailey, to undergo the remainder of the sentence. A print of the time shows the corpse as it lay here. 
<P>It was at this hall that Goldsmith presented <pb id="P.472" n="472"> himself in a new suit--not paid for--to be examined as to his qualifications for being a surgeon's mate, on the <datestruct VALUE="1758-12-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>. <QUOTE>The beadle called my name,</QUOTE> says Roderick Random, when he found himself in a similiar condition at that place of torture, <QUOTE>with a voice that made me tremble as much as if it had been the sound of the last trumpet. However, there was no remedy: I was conducted into a large hall, where I saw about a dozen of grim faces sitting at a long table, <num value="1">one</num> of whom bade me come forward in such an imperious tone, that I was actually for a minute or <num value="2">two</num> bereft of my senses.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>Whether the same process,</QUOTE> says Mr. John Forster, <QUOTE>conducted through a like memorable scene, bereft poor Goldsmith altogether of his, cannot now be ascertained. All that is known is told in a dry extract from the books of the College of Surgeons:  <Q>At a Court of Examiners, held at the Theatre,   <datestruct VALUE="1758-12-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>, present </Q> --the names are not given, but there is a long list of the candidates who passed, in the midst of which these occur:  <Q>James Bernard, mate to an hospital. Oliver Goldsmith, not qualified for ditto.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>A   harder sentence,</QUOTE> continues Goldsmith's biographer, <QUOTE>a more cruel doom than this, at the time, must have seemed, even the Old Bailey has not often been witness to; yet, far from blaming that worthy court of examiners, should we not rather feel that much praise is due to them? That they did their duty in rejecting the short, thick, dull, ungainly, over-anxious, over-dressed, simple-looking Irishman who presented himself that memorable day, can hardly, I think, be doubted; but unconsciously they also did a great deal more. They found him not qualified to be a surgeon's mate, but left him qualified to heal the wounds and abridge the sufferings of all the world.   They found him querulous with adversity, given up to irresolute fears, too much blinded with failures and sorrows to see the divine uses to which they tended still; and from all this their sternly just and awful decision drove him resolutely back.   While the door of the Surgeons' Hall was shut upon him that day, the gate of the beautiful mountain was slowly opening.</QUOTE> 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.472.1">At what used to be No. <num value="68">68</num> of the Old Bailey</LEMMA>, <QUOTE>the <num value="2">second</num> door south   of Ship Court,</QUOTE> lived Jonathan Wild, the famous thief-taker, who had a very intimate acquaintance with the Sessions House. 
<P>A description of the Old Bailey would be decidedly incomplete were we to omit giving a sketch of the career of this noted inhabitant. Almost every great man arrives at eminence by zeal and energy, devoted to some particular calling; and it may be worth our pains to look for a little at that which Jonathan made peculiarly his own. His occupation was the restoration of stolen goods, carried on from about the year <datestruct value="1712"><year reg="1712">1712</year></datestruct>, through a secret confederacy with all the regular thieves, burglars, and highwaymen of the metropolis, whose depredations he prompted and directed. An Act of Parliament, passed in <datestruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct>, tended rather to check the display of his peculiar talents.   By this Act persons convicted of receiving or buying goods, knowing them to be stolen, were made liable to transportation for <num value="14">fourteen</num> years; and by another clause, with a particular view to Wild's proceedings, a heavy punishment was awarded to all who trafficked in such goods and divided the money with felons. Wild's ingenuity and audacity, however, long enabled him to elude this new law. He was <num value="1">one</num> of the cleverest of rogues, and it has been well said, in <num value="1">one</num> sense, merited the name of <QUOTE>great,</QUOTE> bestowed upon him by Fielding, in whose history of him, although the incidents are fictitious, there is no exaggeration of his talents or courage, any more than of his unscrupulousness and want of all moral principle. The plan upon which he conducted his extensive business operations was this. When thieves made prizes of any sort, they delivered them up to him, instead of carrying them to the pawnbroker, and Wild restored the goods to the owners, for a consideration, by which means large sums were raised, and the thieves remained secure from detection. To manage this, he would apply to persons who had been robbed, and pretend to be greatly concerned at their misfortunes, adding that some suspected goods had been stopped by a friend of his, a broker, who would be willing to give them up; and he did not fail to throw out a hint that the broker merited some reward for his disinterested conduct and his trouble, and to exact a promise that no disagreeable consequences should follow on account of the broker's having omitted to secure the thieves as well as the property. The person whose goods had been carried off was generally not unwilling by this means to save himself the trouble and expense of a prosecution, and the money paid was usually sufficient to remunerate the <QUOTE>broker,</QUOTE> as well as his agent. 
<P>At last, after he had amassed a considerable sum, he adopted another and a safer plan.. He opened an office, to which great numbers resorted, in the hope of obtaining the restitution of their property. His light was by no means hid under a bushel, and he kept it burning with the greatest credit and profit to himself.   Let us suppose some <num value="1">one</num> to have had goods stolen of a considerable value. He calls upon Mr. Wild, at his office, and pays half-a-crown for advice. Wild enters his name <pb id="P.473" n="473"> and address in his books, inquires particularly about the robbery, and sounds his client as to the reward he will give in the event of the restitution being made. <QUOTE>If you call again,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>I hope I shall be able to give you some agreeable information.</QUOTE> He calls again.   Wild says that he has heard about the goods, but the agent he has employed tells him that the robbers pretend that by pawning them   they can raise more   money than the amount of the reward. Would   it not, he suggests, be a good plan to increase the reward?   The client consents, and retires. He calls the <num value="3">third</num> time. He has the goods placed in his hands: he pays the reward over to Jonathan, and there is the end of the transaction. 
<P>In the course of this business it will readily be perceived that Wild became possessed of the secrets of every notorious thief about London. All the highwaymen, shoplifters, and housebreakers knew that they were under the necessity of complying with whatever he thought fit to demand. Should they oppose his inclination, they were certain, ere long, to be placed   within reach of the clutches of justice, and be sacrificed to the injured laws of their country. Wild led <num value="2">two</num> lives, so to speak; <num value="1">one</num> amongst ruffians, and the   other as a man of consequence, with laced clothes and a sword, before the public eye; and the latter life was as unlike the former as any <num value="2">two</num> lives could well be. 
<P>He professed, in public, to be the most zealous of thief-takers; and to ordinary observation his life and strength seemed devoted to the pursuit and apprehension of felons. At his trial--for his trial came at last-he had a printed paper handed to the jury, entitled, <QUOTE>A List of Persons discovered, apprehended, and convicted of several robberies on the highway, and also for burglary and housebreaking, and also for returning from   transportation, by Jonathan Wild;</QUOTE> and it contained the names of <num value="35">thirty-five</num> robbers, <num value="22">twenty-two</num> housebreakers, and <num value="10">ten</num> returned convicts, whom he had been instrumental in getting hanged.   This statement was probably true enough. In the records of the trials at the Old Bailey, for many years before it came to his own turn, he repeatedly appeared, figuring in the witness-box, and giving evidence for the prosecution, and in many cases he seems to have taken a leading part in the apprehension of the prisoner. 
<P>In carrying on his trade of blood, Wild, of course, was occasionally turned upon by his betrayed and desperate victim.   But, when this happened, his brazen-faced effrontery carried everything before it. In a trial, for example, of <num value="3">three</num> unfortunate wretches indicted for several robberies in <datestruct VALUE="1723-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1723">1723</year></datestruct>, he gave the following account of his proceedings :-- <QUOTE>Some coming (I suppose from the prosecutors) to me about the robbery, I made it my business to search after the prisoners, for I had heard that they used to rob about Hampstead; and I went about it the more willingly, because I had heard they had threatened to shoot me through the head. I offered <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> a head for any person who would discover them; upon which a woman came and told me that the prisoners had been with her husband, to entice him to turn out with them; and if I would promise he should come and go safely he would give me some intelligence. I gave her my promise; and her husband came accordingly, and told me that Levee and Blake, <num value="2">two</num> of the party, were at that time cleaning their pistols at a house in Fetter Lane. I went thither and seized them both.</QUOTE> The husband of the woman, it appears, had really taken part in <num value="1">one</num> of the robberies, though he now came forward to convict his associates, having been, no doubt, all along in league with Wild; and Blake (better known to fame as Blueskin) also figured as king's evidence on this occasion, and frankly admitted that he had been out with the prisoners. The <num value="3">three</num> unlucky characters in the dock, while their comrades thus figured in a freer and more pleasant situation, <QUOTE>all,</QUOTE> says the account of the trial, vehemently <QUOTE>exclaimed against Jonathan Wild;</QUOTE> but they were found guilty, and had the pleasure of swinging in company on Tyburn-tree a few days afterwards. 
<P>But, in all fairness to Jonathan, it must be said that he did not, till the last moment, desert his friends, and that he only sacrificed them for the general good of the concern, and from a bold and comprehensive view of the true policy of trade. Blueskin's turn to be tried, convicted, and hanged, came about a couple of years after the affair just mentioned.   Wild was to have been a witness against him; but a day or <num value="2">two</num> before the trial, when he went to pay a visit to his intended victim, Blueskin drew out a clasp-knife, and, in a twinkling, fell upon Jonathan, and cut his throat. The blade was too blunt, however, and the thief-taker received no lasting damage. When the verdict was given, Blueskin addressed the court, and told them of an exceedingly kindly promise his late partner had made him. <QUOTE>On Wednesday last, Jonathan Wild said to Simon Jacobs (another prisoner soon after transported),  <Q> I believe-you will not bring <measure value="40l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40">40</num></measure> this time; I wish Joe (meaning me) was in your case; but I'll do my endeavour to bring you off as a single felon</Q> </QUOTE> (crimes punishable only by transportation, whipping, imprisonment, &amp;c., were denominated single felonies). <QUOTE>And then, turning to me, he said,  <Q>I believe you must die; I'll <hi rend=italics>send you a good book <pb id="P.474" n="474">

<P>The reward of <measure value="40l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40">40</num></measure>, it has been explained, which Wild could not manage to make Jacobs bring <QUOTE>this time,</QUOTE> was part of a system established by various Acts of Parliament, which assigned certain money payments to be made to persons apprehending and prosecuting to conviction highway robbers, coiners, and other delinquents. 
<P>We come now to the end of Wild's career. He was committed to Newgate on the <datestruct VALUE="1725-02-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>, on a charge of having assisted a criminal in his escape from prison.

On the morning of the execution the wretched man swallowed a dose of poison, but it failed to end his life, and in a state of half-insensibility he was placed in the cart that was to convey him to the gallows. On the way he was pelted by the populace with stones and dirt, and, altogether, this <pb id="P.475" n="475">

 arch-villain made rather a pitiable exit from this world. At the foot of the gallows he remained so long drowsy in the cart, that the mob called out to the hangman that they would knock him on the head if the hanging was not at once proceeded with. The amiable Jonathan had <num value="5">five</num> wives.   His eldest son, soon after his father's execution, sold himself for a servant to the plantations. A skull claiming to be the great thief-taker's was exhibited, some years ago, in St. Giles's, but as it was not fractured in several places, it was probably spurious. Wild boasted in prison of the numerous robbers he had captured, and the wounds he had received

<P>In the Old Bailey stood Sydney House, occupied, in the time of Pennant, by a coachmaker.   Once it was the proud mansion of the Sydneys. They occupied it till their removal to Leicester House, at the north-east corner of Leicester Square. 
<P>The names of several eminent personsalto- gether independent of the <QUOTE>Old Bailey Sessions House</QUOTE> --occur to us as we perambulate this interesting locality.   William Camden, the <QUOTE>nourrice of antiquitie,</QUOTE> was born in the Old Bailey,   in <datestruct value="1550--"><year reg="1550">1550</year></datestruct>. His father   was a paper-stainer here. In Ship Court, on the west side, Hogarth's father, Richard Hogarth, kept a school. He seems to have come early from the North of England, and was employed in London as a teacher and as a corrector of the press.   He was a man of some learning; and Chalmers, writing in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, mentions that a   dictionary in Latin and English, which he compiled for the use of schools, was then extant in manuscript.

It has long been removed. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> of the courts leading out of the Old Bailey was Green Arbour Court, which ran from the upper end of the street into Seacoal Lane.

As to his sojourn here we shall tale the liberty of quoting a graphic passage from Mr. John Forster, <num value="1">one</num> of   the best of Goldsmith's numerous bio- 
<P> <QUOTE>With part   of the money,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>received from Hamilton</QUOTE> --the proprietor of the <title>Critical Review</title>, to which the poet was at this time contributing-- <QUOTE>he moved into fresh lodgings; took unrivalled possession of a fresh garret, on a <num value="1">first</num> floor.   The house was No. <num value="12">12</num>, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.477.1">Green Arbour Court</LEMMA>, Fleet Street, between the Old Bailey and the site of Fleet Market;   and stood in the right-hand corner of the court, as the wayfarer approached it from Farringdon Street by the appropriate access of  <Q>Breakneck Steps.</Q>    Green Arbour Court is now gone for ever, and of its miserable wretchedness, for   little time replaced by the more decent comforts of a stable, not a vestige remains. The houses, crumbling and tumbling in Goldsmith's day, were fairly rotten down some   <num value="19">nineteen</num> years since</QUOTE> (Mr. Forster is writing in <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE>and it became necessary, for safety sake, to remove what time had spared. But Mr. Washington Irving saw them <num value="1">first</num>, and with reverence had described them for Goldsmith's sake. Through alleys, courts, and blind passages traversing Fleet Market, and thence turning along a narrow street to the bottom of a long steep flight of stone steps, he made good his toilsome way up into Green Arbour Court.   He found it a small square of tall and miserable houses; the very intestines of which seemed turned inside out, to judge from the old garments and frippery that fluttered from   every window.  <Q> It appeared,</Q>  he says, in his  <Q>Tales of a Traveller,</Q>   <Q>to be a region of washerwomen, and lines were stretched <pb id="P.477" n="477"> about the little square, on which clothes were dangling to dry.</Q>  The disputed right to a washtub was going on when he entered; heads in mob-caps were protruded from every window; and the loud clatter of vulgar tongues was assisted by the shrill pipe of swarming children, nestled and cradled in every procreant chamber of the hive. The whole scene, in short, was <num value="1">one</num> of whose unchanged resemblance to the scenes of former days I have since found curious corroboration in a. magazine engraving of the place nigh half a century old.<NOTE>See the frontispiece to vol. xliii   of the <title>European Magazine</title>.</NOTE>   Here were the tall faded houses, with heads out of window at every storey; the dirty neglected children;   the bawling slipshod women; in <num value="1">one</num> corner, clothes hanging to dry, and in another the cure of smoky chimneys announced Without question,   the same squalid squalling colony as it then was, it had been in Goldsmith's time.   He would compromise with the children for occasional cessation of their noise, by occasional cakes or sweetmeats, or by a tune upon his flute, for which all the court assembled; he would talk pleasantly with the poorest of his neighbours, and was long recollected   to have greatly enjoyed the   talk   of a   working watchmaker in the court. Every night he would risk his neck at those steep stone stairs; every day--for his clothes had become too ragged to submit to daylight scrutiny-he would keep within his dirty, naked, unfurnished room, with its single wooden chair and window   bench. And that was Goldsmith's home.</QUOTE> 
<P>It was in this lodging that the poet received a visit from Percy, then busily engaged in collecting material   for his famous <title>Reliques of English Poetry.</title>   The      graye church dignitary discovered Goldsmith in his wretched room busily writing.

Whilst the <num value="2">two</num> were sitting talking together- Percy   relates in his memoir--some <num value="1">one</num> was   heard to rap gently at the door, and being desired to come in,   a poor ragged little girl of very decent behaviour entered, who, dropping   a curtsey, said, <QUOTE>My mamma sends her compliments, and begs the favour of you to lend her a pot-full of coals.</QUOTE>

<P>Many interesting associations-principally, however, connected with the annals of crime and the execution of the laws of England--belong to the Church of St. Sepulchre,--or. St. &lsquo;Pulchre. This sacred edifice-anciently known as St. Sepulchre's in the Bailey, or by Chamberlain Gate (now Newgate)--stands at the eastern end of the slight acclivity of Snow   Hill, and between Smithfield and   the Old   Bailey. The   genuine materials for its early history are scanty enough.   It was probably founded about the commencement of the <num value="12">twelfth</num> century, but. of the exact date and circumstances of its origin there is no record whatever., Its name is derived from the Holy Sepulchre of our Saviour at Jerusalem, to the memory of which it was <num value="1">first</num> dedicated. 
<P>The earliest authentic notice of the church, ccording to Maitland, is of the year <datestruct value="1178"><year reg="1178">1178</year></datestruct>, at which date it was given by Roger, Bishop of Sarum, to the Prior and Canons of St. Bartholomew, These held the right of advowson until the dissolution of monasteries by Henry VIII., and from that time until <datestruct value="1610--"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct> it remained in the hands of the Crown. James I., however, then granted <QUOTE>the rectory and its appurtenances, with the advowson of the vicarage,</QUOTE> to Francis Phillips and others. The next stage in its history is that the rectory was purchased by the parishioners, to be held in fee-farm of the Crown, and the advowson was obtained by the President and Fellows of St. John the Baptist College, at Oxford. The church was rebuilt about the middle of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century, when <num value="1">one</num> of the Popham family, who had been Chancellor of Normandy and Treasurer of the King's Household, with distinguished <pb id="P.478" n="478"> liberality erected a handsome chapel on the south side of the choir, and the very beautiful porch still remaining at the south-west corner of the building. <QUOTE>His image,</QUOTE> Stow says, <QUOTE>fair graven in stone, was fixed over the said porch.</QUOTE> 
<P>The dreadful fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct> almost destroyed St, Sepulchre's, but the parishioners set energetically to work, and it was <QUOTE>rebuilt and beautified both within and without.</QUOTE> The general reparation was under the direction of Sir Christopher Wren, and nothing but the walls of the old building, and these not entirely, were suffered to remain. The work was done rapidly, and the whole was completed within <num value="4">four</num> years. 
<P> <QUOTE>The tower,</QUOTE> says Mr. Godwin, <QUOTE>retained its original aspect, and the body of the church, after its restoration, presented a series of windows between buttresses, with pointed heads filled with tracery, crowned by a string-course and battlements. In this form it remained till the year <datestruct value="1790"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, when it appears the whole fabric was found to be in a state of great decay, and it was resolved to repair it throughout. Accordingly the walls of the church were cased with Portland stone, and all the windows were taken out and replaced by others with plain semi-circular heads, as now seencer- tainly agreeing but badly with the tower and porch of the building, but according with the then prevailing spirit of economy. The battlements, too, were taken down, and a plain stone parapet was substituted, so that at this time (with the exception of the roof, which was wagon-headed, and presented on the outside an unsightly swell, visible above the parapet) the church assumed its present appearance.</QUOTE> The ungainly roof was removed, and an entirely new <num value="1">one</num> erected, about <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>. 
<P>At each corner of the tower- <QUOTE><num value="1">one</num> of the most ancient,</QUOTE> says the author of <title lang=la>Londinium   Redivivum,</title> <QUOTE>in the outline of the circuit of London?</QUOTE> --there are spires, and on the spires there are weathercocks. These have been made use of by Howell to point a moral: <QUOTE>Unreasonable people,</QUOTE> says he, <QUOTE>are as hard to reconcile as the vanes of St. Sepulchre's tower, which never look all <num value="4">four</num> upon <num value="1">one</num> point of the heavens.</QUOTE> Nothing can be said with certainty as to the date of the tower, but it is not without the bounds of probability that it formed part of the original building. The belfry is reached by a small winding staircase in the south-west angle, and a similar staircase in an opposite angle leads to the summit. The spires at the corners, and some of the tower windows, have very recently undergone several alterations, which have added much to the picturesqueness and beauty of the church. 
<P>The chief entrance to St. Sepulchre's is by a 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.478.1">porch of singular beauty</LEMMA>, projecting from the south side of the tower, at the western end of the church. The groining of the ceiling of this porch, it has been pointed out, takes an almost unique form; the ribs are carved in bold relief, and the bosses at the intersections represent angels' heads, shields, roses, &amp;c., in great variety. 
<P>Coming now to the interior of the church, we find it divided into <num value="3">three</num> aisles, by <num value="2">two</num> ranges of Tuscan columns. The aisles are of unequal widths, that in the centre being the widest, that to the south the narrowest.   Semi-circular arches connect the columns on either side, springing directly from their capitals, without the interposition of an entablature, and support a large dental cornice, extending round the church.   The ceiling of the middle aisle is divided into <num value="7">seven</num> compartments, by horizontal bands, the middle compartment being formed into a small dome. 
<P>The aisles have groined ceilings, ornamented at the angles with doves, &amp;c., and beneath every division of the groining are small windows, to admit light to the galleries. Over each of the aisles there is a gallery, very clumsily introduced, which dates from the time when the church was built by Wren, and extends the whole length, excepting at the chancel.   The front of the gallery, which is of oak, is described by Mr. Godwin as carved into scrolls, branches, &amp;c., in the centre panel, on either side, with the initials <QUOTE>C. R.,</QUOTE> enriched with carvings of laurel, which have, however, he says, <QUOTE>but little merit.</QUOTE> 
<P>At the east end of the church there are <num value="3">three</num> semicircular-headed windows. Beneath the centre <num value="1">one</num> is a large Corinthian altar-piece of oak, displaying columns, entablatures, &amp;c., elaborately carved and gilded. 
<P>The length of the church, exclusive of the ambulatory, is said to be <num value="126">126</num> feet, the breadth <num value="68">68</num> feet, and the height of the tower <num value="140">140</num> feet. 
<P>A singularly ugly sounding-board, extending over the preacher, used to stand at the back of the pulpit, at the east end of the church. It was in the shape of a large parabolic reflector, about <num value="12">twelve</num> feet in diameter, and was composed of ribs of mahogany. 
<P>At the west end of the church there is a large organ, said to be the oldest and <num value="1">one</num> of the finest in London.   It was built in <datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>, and has been greatly enlarged. Its reed-stops (hautboy, clarinet, &amp;c.) are supposed to be unrivalled.   In Newcourt's time the church was taken notice of as <QUOTE>remarkable for possessing an exceedingly fine organ, and the playing is thought so beautiful, that large <pb id="P.479" n="479"> congregations are attracted, though some of the parishioners object to the mode of performing divine service.</QUOTE> 
<P>On the north side of the church, Mr. Godwin mentions, is a large apartment known as <QUOTE>St. Stephen's Chapel.</QUOTE> This building evidently formed a somewhat important part of the old church, and was probably appropriated to the votaries of the saint whose name it bears. 
<P>Between the exterior and the interior of the church there is little harmony. <QUOTE>For example,</QUOTE> says Mr. Godwin, <QUOTE>the columns which   form   the south aisle face, in some instances, the centre of the large windows which occur in the external wall of the church, and in others the centre of the piers, indifferently.</QUOTE> This discordance may likely enough have arisen from the fact that when the church was rebuilt, or rather restored, after the Great Fire, the works were done without much attention from Sir Christopher Wren. 
<P>St. Sepulchre's appears to have enjoyed   considerable popularity from the earliest period of its history, if <num value="1">one</num> is to judge from the various sums left by well-disposed persons for the support of certain fraternities founded in the church--namely, those of St. Katherine, St. Michael, St. Anne, and Our Lady-and   by others; for the maintenance of chantry priests to celebrate masses at stated intervals for the good of their souls.   <num value="1">One</num> of the fraternities just named--that of St. Katherineoriginated, according to Stow, in the devotion of some poor persons in the parish, and was   in honour of the conception of the Virgin Mary. They met in the church on the   day of the Conception, and there had the mass of the day, and offered to the same, and provided a certain chaplain daily to celebrate divine service, and to set up wax lights before the image belonging to the fraternity, on all festival days. 
<P>The most famous of all who have been interred in St. Sepulchre's is Roger Ascham, the author of the <title>Schoolmaster,</title> and the instructor of Queen Elizabeth in Greek and Latin.    This learned old worthy was born in <datestruct value="1515--"><year reg="1515">1515</year></datestruct>, near Northallerton, in Yorkshire.   He was educated at Cambridge University, and in time rose to be the university orator, being notably zealous in promoting what was then a novelty in England--the study of the Greek language. To divert himself after the fatigue of severe study, he used to devote himself to archery.   This drew down upon him the censure of the all-work-and-no-play school; and in defence of himself, Ascham, in <datestruct value="1545--"><year reg="1545">1545</year></datestruct>, published   <title>Toxophilus,</title> a treatise on his favourite sport.   This book is even yet well worthy of perusal, for its enthusiasm, and for its curious descriptions of the personal appearance and manners of the principal persons whom the author had seen and conversed with.   Henry VIII. rewarded him with a pension of <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> per annum, a considerable sum in those days. In <datestruct value="1548--"><year reg="1548">1548</year></datestruct>, Ascham, on the death of William Grindall, who had been his pupil, was appointed instructor in the learned languages to Lady Elizabeth, afterwards the good Queen Bess. At the end of <num value="2">two</num> years he had some dispute with, or took a disgust at, Lady Elizabeth's attendants, resigned his situation, and returned to his college. Soon after this he was employed as secretary to the English ambassador at the court   of Charles V. of Germany, and remained abroad till the death of Edward VI.   During his absence   he had been appointed Latin secretary to King Edward. Strangely enough, though Queen Mary and her ministers were Papists, and Ascham a Protestant, he was retained in his office of Latin secretary, his pension was increased to <hi rend=italics><measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>,   and he was</hi> allowed to retain his fellowship and his situation as a university orator. In <datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct> he married a lady of good family, by whom he had a considerable fortune and of whom, in writing to   a friend, he gives, as might perhaps be expected, an excellent character. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth, in <datestruct value="1558--"><year reg="1558">1558</year></datestruct>, she not only required his services as Latin secretary, but as her instructor in Greek, and he resided   at Court during the remainder of his   life. He   died in consequence of his endeavors to complete a Latin poem which he intended to present to the queen on the New Year's Day of <datestruct value="1569--"><year reg="1569">1569</year></datestruct>.   He breathed his last <num value="2">two</num> days before <datestruct value="1568--"><year reg="1568">1568</year></datestruct> ran out, and was interred, according to his own directions, in the most private manner, in St. Sepulchre's Church, his funeral sermon being preached by Dr. Andrew   Nowell, Dean of St. Paul's.   He was universally lamented; and even the queen herself not only showed great concern, but was pleased to say that she would rather have lost <measure value="10000l." type=currency><num value="10000">ten thousand</num> pounds</measure> than her tutor Ascham, which from that   somewhat closehanded sovereign, was truly   an expression of high regard. 
<P>Ascham, like most men, had his little weaknesses.   He had too great a propensity to dice and cock-fighting. Bishop Nicholson would try to convince us that this is an unfounded calumny, but, as it is mentioned by Camden, and other contemporary writers, it seems impossible to deny it.   He died, from all accounts, in indifferent circumstances. <QUOTE>Whether,</QUOTE> says Dr. Johnson, referring to this, <QUOTE>Ascham was poor by his own fault, or the fault of others, cannot now be decided; but it is certain that many have been rich with <pb id="P.480" n="480"> less merit. His philological learning would have gained him honour in any country; and among us it may justly call for that reverence which all nations owe to those who <num value="1">first</num> rouse them from ignorance, and kindle among them the light of literature.</QUOTE> His most valuable work, <title>The Schoolmaster,</title> was published by his widow. The nature of this celebrated performance may be gathered from the title: <QUOTE>The Schoolmaster; or a plain and perfite way of teaching children to understand, write, and speak the Latin tongue. <gap> And commodious also for all such as have forgot the Latin tongue, and would by themselves, without a schoolmaster, in 
<FIGURE id="Fig.480" n="2000.07.0171"><HEAD>Goldsmith's House, Green Arbour Court, About <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 short time, and with small pains, recover a sufficient habilitie to understand, write, and speak Latin: by Roger Ascham, ann. <datestruct value="1570--"><year reg="1570">1570</year></datestruct>. At London, printed by John Daye, dwelling over Aldersgate,</QUOTE> a printer, by the way, already mentioned by us a few chapters back (see page <num value="208">208</num>), as having printed several noted works of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century. 
<P>Dr. Johnson remarks that the instruction recommended in <title>The Schoolmaster</title> is perhaps the best ever given for the study of languages. 
<P>Here also <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.481.1">lies buried Captain John Smith</LEMMA>, a conspicuous soldier of fortune, whose romantic adventures and daring exploits have rarely been <pb id="P.481" n="481"> surpassed. He died on the <datestruct VALUE="1631-06-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1631">1631</year></datestruct>. This valiant captain was born at Willoughby, in the county of Lincoln, and helped by his doings to enliven the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. He had a share in the wars of Hungary in <datestruct value="1602--"><year reg="1602">1602</year></datestruct>, and in <num value="3">three</num> single combats overcame <num value="3">three</num> Turks, and cut off their heads. For this, and other equally brave deeds, Sigismund, Duke of Transylvania, gave him his picture set in gold, with a pension of <num value="300">three hundred</num> ducats   and allowed him to bear <num value="3">three</num> Turks' heads proper as his shield of arms. He afterwards went to America, where he had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Indians. He escaped from them, however, at last, and resumed his brilliant career by hazarding his life in naval engagements with pirates and Spanish men-of-war. The most important act of his life was the share he had in civilising the natives of New England, and reducing that province to obedience to Great Britain. In connection with his tomb in St. Sepulchre's, he is mentioned by Stow, in his <title>Survey,</title> as <QUOTE>some time Governor of Virginia and Admiral of New England.</QUOTE> 
<P>Certainly the most   interesting events of his chequered career were his capture by the Indians, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.481" n="2000.07.0172"><HEAD>St. Sepulchre's Church In <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>. (From A View   By Toms.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 and the saving of his life by the Indian girl Pocahontas, a story of adventure that charms as often as it is told.   Bancroft, the historian of the United States, relates how, during the early settlement of Virginia, Smith left the infant colony on an exploring expedition, and not only ascended the river Chickahominy, but struck into the interior. His companions disobeyed his instructions, and being surprised by the Indians, were put to death. Smith preserved his own life by calmness and self-possession. Displaying a pocket-compass, he amused the savages by an explanation of its power, and increased their admiration of his superior genius by imparting to them some vague conceptions of the form of the earth, and the nature of the planetary system. To the Indians, who retained him as their prisoner, his captivity was a more strange event than anything of which the traditions of their tribes preserved the memory. He was allowed to send a letter to the fort at Jamestown,. and the savage wonder was increased, for he seemed by some magic to endow the paper with the gift of intelligence. It was evident that their captive was a being of a high order, and then the question arose, Was his nature beneficent, or was he to be <pb id="P.482" n="482"> dreaded as a dangerous enemy?     Their minds were bewildered, and the decision of his fate was referred to the chief Powhatan, and before Powhatan Smith was brought. <QUOTE>The fears of the feeble aborigines,</QUOTE> says Bancroft, <QUOTE>were about to prevail, and   his   immediate   death, already   repeatedly threatened and repeatedly delayed, would have been inevitable, but for the timely intercession of Pocahontas, a girl <num value="12">twelve</num> years old, the daughter of Powhatan, whose confiding fondness Smith had easily won, and who firmly clung to his neck, as his head was bowed down to receive the stroke of the tomahawks.   His fearlessness, and her entreaties, persuaded the council to spare the agreeable stranger, who could make hatchets for her father, and rattles and strings of beads for herself, the favourite child. The barbarians, whose decision had long been held in suspense by the mysterious awe which Smith had inspired, now resolved to receive him as a friend, and to make him a partner of their councils. They tempted him   to join their bands, and lend assistance in an attack upon the white men at Jamestown; and when his decision of character succeeded in changing the current of their thoughts, they dismissed him with mutual promises of friendship and benevolence. Thus the captivity of Smith did itself become a benefit to the colony; for he had   not only observed with care the   country between the James and the Potomac, and had gained   some   knowledge   of the language   and manners of the natives, but he now established a peaceful intercourse between the English and the tribes of Powhatan.</QUOTE> 
<P>On the monument erected to Smith in St. Sepulchre's Church, the following quaint lines were formerly inscribed:--

<L>And made their land, being so large a station, 
<L>An habitation for our Christian nation,

<P>Sir Robert Peake, the engraver, also found a last resting-place here.

<P> <QUOTE>The churchyard of St. Sepulchre's,</QUOTE> we learn from Maitland, <QUOTE>at <num value="1">one</num> time extended so far into the street on the south side of the church, as to render the passage-way dangerously narrow. In <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct> the churchyard was, in consequence, levelled, and thrown open to the public.

<P>Sarah Malcolm, the murderess, was buried in the churchyard of St. Sepulchre's in <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>. This coldhearted and keen-eyed monster in human form has had her story told by us already. The parishioners seem, on this occasion, to have had no   such scruples as had been exhibited by their predecessors a <num value="150">hundred and fifty</num> years previous at the burial of Awfield, a traitor. We shall see presently that in those more remote days they were desirous of having at least respectable company for their deceased relatives and friends in the churchyard. 
<P> <QUOTE>For a long period,</QUOTE> says Mr. Godwin (<datestruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE>the church was surrounded by low mean buildings, by which its general appearance was hidden; but these having been cleared away, and the neighbourhood made considerably more open, St. Sepulchre's now forms a somewhat pleasing object, notwithstanding that the tower and a part of the porch are so entirely dissimilar in style to the remainder of the building.</QUOTE> And since Godwin's writing the surroundings of the church have been so improved that perhaps few buildings in the metropolis stand more prominently before the public eye. 
<P>In the glorious roll of martyrs who have suffered at the stake for their religious principles, a vicar of St. Sepulchre's, the Reverend John Rogers, occupies a conspicuous place. He was the <num value="1">first</num> who was burned in the reign of the Bloody Mary. This eminent person had at <num value="1">one</num> time been chaplain to the English merchants at Antwerp, and while residing in that city had aided Tindal and Coverdale in their great work of translating the Bible. He married a German lady of good position, by whom he had a large family, and was enabled, by means of her relations, to reside in peace and <pb id="P.483" n="483"> safety in Germany. It appeared to be his duty, however, to return to England, and there publicly profess and advocate his religious convictions, even at the risk of death. He crossed the sea; he took his place in the pulpit at St. Paul's Cross; he preached a fearless and animated sermon, reminding his astonished audience of the pure and wholesome doctrine which had been promulgated from that pulpit in the days of the good King Edward, and solemnly warning them against the pestilent idolatry and superstition of these new times. It was his last sermon. He was apprehended, tried, condemned, and burned at Smithfield. We described, when speaking of Smithfield, the manner in which he met his fate. 
<P>Connected with the martyrdom of Rogers an odd circumstance is quoted in the <title>Churches of London.</title>   It is stated that when the bishops had resolved to put to death Joan Bocher, a friend came to Rogers and earnestly entreated his influence that the poor woman's life might be spared, and other means taken to prevent the spread of her heterodox doctrines.   Rogers, however, contended that she should be executed; and his friend then begged him to choose some other kind of death, which should be more agreeable to the gentleness and mercy prescribed in the gospel. <QUOTE>No,</QUOTE> replied Rogers, <QUOTE>burning alive is not a cruel death, but easy enough.</QUOTE> . His friend hearing these words, expressive of so little regard for the sufferings of a fellow-creature, answered him with great vehemence, at the same time striking Rogers' hand, <QUOTE>Well, it may perhaps so happen that you yourself shall have your hands full of this mild burning.</QUOTE> There is no record of Rogers among the papers belonging to St. Sepulchre's, but this may easily be accounted for by the fact that at the Great Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct> nearly all the registers and archives were destroyed. 
<P>A noteworthy incident in the history of St. Sepulchre's was connected with the execution, in <datestruct value="1585--"><year reg="1585">1585</year></datestruct>, of Awfield, for <QUOTE>sparcinge abrood certen lewed, sedicious, and traytorous bookes.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>When he was executed,</QUOTE> says Fleetwood, the Recorder, in a letter to Lord Burleigh, <datestruct value="07-7"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=7>7th</day></datestruct> of that year, <QUOTE>his body was brought unto St. Pulcher's to be buryed, but the parishioners would not suffer a traytor's corpse to be laid in the earth where their parents, wives, children, kindred, masters, and old neighbours did rest; and so his carcass was returned to the burial-ground near Tyburn, and there I leave it.</QUOTE> 
<P>Another event in the history of the church is a tale of suicide. On the <datestruct VALUE="1600-04-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>, a man named William Dorrington threw himself from the roof of the tower, leaving there a prayer for forgiveness. 
<P>We come now to speak of the connection of St. Sepulchre's with the neighbouring prison of Newgate. Being the nearest church to the prison, that connection naturally was intimate. Its clock served to give the time to the hangman when there was an execution in the Old Bailey, and many a poor wretch's last moments must it have regulated. 
<P>On the right-hand side of the altar a board with a list of charitable donations and gifts used to contain the following item:-- <QUOTE><datestruct value="1605--"><year reg="1605">1605</year></datestruct>. Mr. Robert Dowe gave, for ringing the greatest bell in this church on the day the condemned prisoners are executed, and for other services, for ever, concerning such condemned prisoners, for which services the sexton is paid <measure value="1l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1">1</num></measure> <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure>--<measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure>.</QUOTE> 
<P>It was formerly the practice for the clerk or bellman of St. Sepulchre's to go under Newgate, on the night preceding the execution of a criminal, ring his bell, and repeat the following wholesome advice : 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>All you that in the condemned hold do lie, 
<L>Prepare you, for to-morrow you shall die; 
<L>Watch all, and pray, the hour is drawing near 
<L>That you before the Almighty must appear; 
<L>Examine well yourselves, in time repent, 
<L>That you may not to eternal flames be sent. 
<L>And when St. Sepulchre's bell to-morrow tolls, 
<L>The Lord above have mercy on your souls. 
<L>Past <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock!</QUOTE>
 
<P>This practice is explained by a passage in Munday's edition of Stow, in which it is told that a Mr. John Dowe, citizen and merchant taylor of London, gave <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> to the parish church of St. Sepulchre's, under the following conditions:--After the several sessions of London, on the night before the execution of such as were condemned to death, the clerk of the church was to go in the night-time, and also early in the morning, to the window of the prison in which they were lying. He was there to ring <QUOTE>certain tolls with a hand-bell</QUOTE> appointed for the purpose, and was afterwards, in a most Christian manner, to put them in mind of their present condition and approaching end, and to exhort them to be prepared, as they ought to be, to die.. When they were in the cart, and brought before the walls of the church, the clerk was to stand there ready with the same bell, and, after certain tolls, rehearse a prayer, desiring all the people there present to pray for the unfortunate criminals. The beadle, also, of Merchant Taylors' Hall was allowed an <QUOTE>honest stipend</QUOTE> to see that this ceremony was regularly performed. 
<P>The affecting admonition-- <QUOTE>affectingly good,</QUOTE> Pennant calls it-addressed to the prisoners in <pb id="P.484" n="484"> Newgate, on the night before execution, ran as follows : 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p><QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>You prisoners that are within, 
<L>Who, for wickedness and sin, after many mercies shown you, are now appointed to die to-morrow in the forenoon; give ear and understand that, to-morrow morning, the greatest bell of St. Sepulchre's shall toll for you, in form and manner of a passing-bell, as used to be tolled for those that are at the point of death; to the end that all godly people, hearing that bell, and knowing it is for your going to your deaths, may be stirred up heartily to pray to God to bestow his grace and mercy upon you, whilst you live.   I beseech you, for Jesus Christ's sake, to keep this night in watching and prayer, to the salvation of your own souls while there is yet time and place for mercy; as knowing to-morrow you must appear before the judgment-seat of your Creator, there to give an account of all things done in this life, and to suffer eternal torments for your sins committed against Him, unless, upon your hearty and unfeigned repentance, you find mercy through the merits, death, and passion of your only Mediator and Advocate, Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return to Him.</QUOTE>
 
<P>And the following was the admonition to condemned criminals, as they were passing by St. Sepulchre's Church wall to execution :--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>All good people, pray heartily unto God for these poor sinners, who are now going to their death, for whom this great bell doth toll. 
<P>You that are condemned to die, repent with lamentable tears; ask mercy of the Lord, for the salvation of your own souls, through the merits, death, and passion of Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return unto Him. 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Lord have mercy upon you; 
<L>Christ have mercy upon you. 
<L>Lord have mercy upon you; 
<L>Christ have mercy upon you.</QUOTE></QUOTE>
 
<P>The charitable Mr. Dowe, who took such interest in the last moments of the occupants of the condemned cell, was buried in the church of St. Botolph, Aldgate. 
<P>Another curious custom observed at St. Sepulchre's was the presentation of a nosegay to every criminal on his way to execution at Tyburn. No doubt the practice had its origin in some kindly feeling for the poor unfortunates who were so soon to bid farewell to all the beauties of earth. <num value="1">One</num> of the last who received a nosegay from the steps of St. Sepulchre's was <QUOTE><num value="16">Sixteen</num>-string Jack,</QUOTE> <hi rend=italics>alias</hi>
 John Rann, who was hanged, in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, for robbing the Rev. Dr. Bell of his watch and eighteen pence in money, in Gunnersbury Lane, on the road to Brentford. <num value="16">Sixteen</num>-string Jack wore the flowers in his button-hole as he rode dolefully to the gallows. This was witnessed by John Thomas Smith, who thus describes the scene in his admirable anecdotebook, <title>Nollekens and his Times</title>: <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>I remember well, when I was in my <num value="8">eighth</num> year, Mr. Nollekens calling at my father's house, in Great Portland Street, and taking us to Oxford Street, to see the notorious Jack Rann, commonly called Sixteenstring Jack, go to Tyburn to be hanged . 
<p>The criminal was dressed in a pea-green coat, with an immense nosegay in the button-hole, which had been presented to him at St. Sepulchre's steps; and his nankeen small-clothes, we were told, were tied at each knee with <num value="16">sixteen</num> strings. After he had passed, and Mr. Nollekens was leading me home by the hand, I recollect his stooping down to me and observing, in a low tone of voice,  <Q>Tom, now, my little man, if my father-in-law, Mr. Justice Welch, had been high constable, we could have walked by the side of the cart all the way to Tyburn.</Q> </QUOTE>
 
<P>When criminals were conveyed from Newgate to Tyburn, the cart passed up Giltspur Street, and through Smithfield, to Cow Lane. Skinner Street had not then been built, and the Crooked Lane which turned down by St. Sepulchre's, as well as Ozier Lane, did not afford sufficient width to admit of the cavalcade pausing by either of them, with convenience, to Holborn Hill, or <QUOTE>the Heavy Hill,</QUOTE> as it used to be called. The procession seems at no time to have had much of the solemn element about it. <QUOTE>The heroes of the day were often,</QUOTE> says a popular writer, <QUOTE>on good terms with the mob, and jokes were exchanged between the men who were going to be hanged and the men who deserved to be.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>On St. Paul's Day,</QUOTE> says Mr. Timbs (<datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE>service is performed in St. Sepulchre's, in accordance with the will of Mr. Paul Jervis, who, in <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct>, devised certain land in trust that a sermon should be preached in the church upon every Paul's Day upon the excellence of the liturgy o the Church of England; the preacher to receive <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">40</num>s.</measure> for such sermon.

<P>In <datestruct value="1749--"><year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>, a Mr. Drinkwater made a praiseworthy bequest.

<P>Next to St. Sepulchre's, on Snow Hill, used to stand the famous old inn of the <QUOTE>Saracen's Head.</QUOTE> It was only swept away within the last few years by the ruthless army of City improvers: a view of it in course of demolition was given on page <num value="439">439</num>. It was <num value="1">one</num> of the oldest of the London inns which bore the <QUOTE>Saracen's Head</QUOTE> for a sign. <num value="1">One</num> of Dick Tarlton's jests makes mention of the <QUOTE>Saracen's Head</QUOTE> without Newgate, and Stow, describing this neighbourhood, speaks particularly of <QUOTE>a fair large inn for receipt of travellers</QUOTE> that <QUOTE>hath to sign the  <Q>Saracen's Head.</Q> </QUOTE> The courtyard had, to the last, many of the characteristics of an old English inn; there were galleries all round leading to the bedrooms, and a spacious gateway through which the dusty mail-coaches used to rumble, the tired passengers creeping forth <QUOTE>thanking. their stars in having escaped the highwaymen and the holes and sloughs of the road.</QUOTE> Into that courtyard how many have come on their <num value="1">first</num> arrival in London with hearts beating high with hope, some of whom have risen to be aldermen and sit in state as lord mayor, whilst others have gone the way of the idle apprentice and come to a sad end at Tyburn! It was at this inn that Nicholas Nickleby and his uncle waited upon the Yorkshire schoolmaster Squeers, of Dotheboys Hall. <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.485.5">Mr. Dickens</LEMMA>
 describes the tavern as it existed in the last days of mail-coaching, when it was a most important place for arrivals and departures in London:-- 
<P> <QUOTE>Next to the jail, and by consequence near to Smithfield also, and the Compter and the bustle and noise of the City, and just on that particular part of Snow Hill where omnibus horses going eastwards seriously think of falling down on purpose, and where horses in hackney cabriolets going westwards not unfrequently fall by accident, is the coach-yard of the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.485.6"> <Q>Saracens Head</Q> </LEMMA> inn, its portals guarded by <num value="2">two</num> Saracen's heads and shoulders, which it was once the pride and glory of the choice spirits of this metropolis to pull down at night, but which have for some time remained in undisturbed tranquillity, possibly because this species of humour is now confined to St. James's parish, where doorknockers are preferred as being more portable, and bell-wires esteemed   as convenient tooth-picks. Whether this be the reason or not, there they are, frowning upon you from each side of the gateway; and the inn itself, garnished with another Saracen's head, frowns upon you from the top of the yard; while from the door of the hind-boot of all the red coaches that are standing therein, there glares a small Saracen's head with a twin expression to the large Saracen's head below, so that the general appearance of the pile is of the Saracenic order.</QUOTE> 
<P>To explain the use of the Saracen's head as an inn sign various reasons have been given. <QUOTE>When our countrymen,</QUOTE> says Selden, <QUOTE>came home from fighting with the Saracens and were beaten by them, they pictured them with huge, big, terrible faces (as you still see the  <Q>Saracen's Head</Q>  is), when in truth they were like other men. But this they did to save their own credit,</QUOTE> Or the sign may have been adopted by those who had visited the Holy Land either as pilgrims or to fight the Saracens. Others, again, hold that it was <num value="1">first</num> set up in compliment to the mother of Thomas a Becket, who was the daughter of a Saracen. However this may be, it is certain that the use of the sign in former days was very general. 
<P>Running past the east end of St. Sepulchre's, from Newgate into West Smithfield, is Giltspur Street, anciently called Knightriders Street. This interesting thoroughfare derives its name from the knights with their gilt spurs having been accustomed to ride this way to the jousts and tournaments which in days of old were held in Smithfield. 
<P>In this street was <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.485.7">Giltspur Street Compter</LEMMA>,   a debtors' prison and house of correction appertaining to the sheriffs of London and Middlesex. It stood over against St. Sepulchre's Church, and was removed hither from the east side of Wood Street, Cheapside, in <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>. At the time of its removal it was used as a place of imprisonment for debtors, but the yearly increasing demands upon the contracted space caused that department to be given up, and City debtors were sent to Whitecross Street. The architect was Dance, to whom we are also indebted for the grim pile of Newgate. The Compter was a dirty and appropriately convictlooking edifice. It was pulled down in <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>. Mr. Hepworth Dixon gave an interesting account of this City House of Correction, not long before its demolition, in his <title>London Prisons</title> ( <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>). <QUOTE>Entering,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>at the door   facing St. Sepulchre's,

 <pb id="P.486" n="486"> the visitor suddenly finds himself in a low dark passage, leading into the offices of the gaol, and branching off into other passages, darker, closer, more replete with noxious smells, than even those of Newgate.   This is the fitting prelude to what follows. The prison, it must be noticed, is divided into <num value="2">two</num> principal divisions, the House of Correction and the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.486.1">Compter</LEMMA>. The front in Giltspur Street, and the side nearest to Newgate Street, is called the Compter.   In its wards are placed detenues of various kinds-remands, committals from the police-courts, and generally persons waiting for trial, and consequently still unconvicted. The other department, the House of Correction, occupies the back portion of the premises, abutting 
<FIGURE id="Fig.486" n="2000.07.0173"><HEAD>Porch Of St. Sepulchre's Church.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 on Christ's Hospital.   Curious it is to consider how   thin a wall divides these widely-separate worlds! And sorrowful it is to think what a difference of destiny awaits the children-destiny inexorable, though often unearned in either case-who, on the <num value="1">one</num> side of it or the other, receive an eleemosynary education! The collegian and the criminal! Who shall say how much mere accidentcircumstances over which the child has little power --determines to a life of usefulness or mischief? From the yards of Giltspur Street prison almost the only objects visible, outside of the gaol itself, are the towers of Christ's Hospital; the only sounds audible, the shouts of the scholars at their play.   The balls of the hospital boys often fall <pb id="P.487" n="487"> within the yards of the prison.   Whether these sights and sounds ever cause the criminal to pause and reflect upon the courses of his life, we will not say, but the stranger visiting the place will be very apt to think for him <gap>
 
<P>In the department of the prison called the House of Correction, minor offenders within the City of London are imprisoned.   No transports are sent hither, nor is any person whose sentence is above <num value="3">three</num> years in length.</QUOTE> This able writer then goes on to tell of the many crying evils connected with the institution--the want of air, the over-crowded state of the rooms, the absence of proper cellular accommodation, and the. vicious intercourse carried on amongst the prisoners. The entire gaol, when he wrote; only contained thirtysix separate sleeping-rooms. Now by the highest prison calculation-and this, be it noted, proceeds on the assumption that <hi rend=italics><num value="3">three</num></hi> persons can sleep in small, miserable, unventilated cells, which are built for only <hi rend=italics><num value="1">one</num></hi>, and are too confined for that, being only about <num value="1">one</num>-half the size of the <hi rend=italics>model cell</hi> for <num value="1">one</num> at Pentonville--it was only capable of accommodating <num value="203">203</num> prisoners, yet by the returns issued at Michaelmas, <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>, it contained <num value="246">246</num>!</QUOTE>

<P>A large section of the prison used to be devoted to female delinquents, but lately it was almost entirely given up to male offenders. 
<P> <QUOTE>The House of Correction, and the Compter portion of the establishment,</QUOTE> says Mr. Dixon, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>are kept quite distinct, but it would be difficult to award the palm of empire in their respective facilities for demoralisation. We think the Compter rather the worse of the <num value="2">two</num>. You are shown into a room, about the size of an apartment in an ordinary dwelling-house, which will be found crowded with from <num value="30">thirty</num> to <num value="40">forty</num> persons, young and old, and in their ordinary costume; the low thief in his filth and rags, and the member of the swell-mob with his bright buttons, flash finery, and false jewels. Here you notice the boy who has just been guilty of his <num value="1">first</num> offence, and committed for trial, learning with a greedy mind a <num value="1000">thousand</num> criminal arts, and listening with the precocious instinct of guilty passions to stories and conversations the most depraved and disgusting. You regard him with a mixture of pity and loathing, for he knows that the eyes of <hi rend=italics>his peers</hi> are upon him, and he stares at you with a familiar impudence, and exhibits a devil-may-care countenance, such as is only to be met with in the <pb id="P.488" n="488"> juvenile offender.   Here, too, may be seen the young clerk, taken up on suspicion-perhaps innocent--who avoids you with a shy look of pain and uneasiness: what a hell must this prison be to him! How frightful it is to think of a person really untainted with crime, compelled to herd for <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> days with these abandoned wretches! 
<P>On the other, the House of Correction side of the gaol, similar rooms will be found, full of prisoners communicating with each other, laughing and shouting without hindrance. All this is so little in accordance with existing notions of prison discipline, that <num value="1">one</num> is continually fancying these disgraceful scenes cannot be in the capital of England, and in the year of grace <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>. Very few of the prisoners attend school or receive any instruction; neither is any kind of employment afforded them, except oakum-picking, and the still more disgusting labour of the treadmill. When at work, an officer is in attendance to prevent disorderly conduct; but his presence is of no avail as a protection to the less depraved. Conversation still goes on; and every facility is afforded for making acquaintances, and for mutual contamination.</QUOTE>

<P>We have already given a view of Pie Corner in our chapter on Smithfield, page <num value="361">361</num>. 
<P>Hosier Lane, running from Cow Lane to Smithfield, and almost parallel to Cock Lane, is described by <QUOTE>R. B.,</QUOTE> in Strype, as a place not over-well built or inhabited.   The houses were all old timber erections.   Some of these-those standing at the south corner of the lane--were in the beginning of this century depicted by Mr. J. T. Smith, in his 
<title>Ancient Topography of London.</title>   He describes them as probably of the reign of James I. The rooms were small, with low, unornamented ceilings; the timber, oak, profusely used; the gables were plain, and the walls lath and plaster. They were taken down in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>. 
<P>In the corner house, in Mr. Smith's time, there was a barber whose name was Catchpole; at least, so it was written over the door. He was rather an odd fellow, and possessed, according to his own account, a famous relic of antiquity. He would gravely show his customers a short-bladed instrument, as the identical dagger with which Walworth killed Wat Tyler. 
<P>Hosier Lane, like Pie Corner, used to be a great resort during the time of Bartholomew Fair, <QUOTE>all the houses,</QUOTE> it is said in Strype, <QUOTE>generally being made public for tippling.</QUOTE> 
<P>We return now from our excursion to the north of St. Sepulchre's, and continue our rambles to the west, and before speaking of what is, let us refer to what has been. 
<P>Turnagain Lane is not far from this. <QUOTE>Near unto this Seacoal Lane,</QUOTE> remarks Stow, <QUOTE>in the turning towards Holborn Conduit, is Turnagain Lane, or rather, as in a record of the <num value="5">5th</num> of Edward III., Windagain Lane, for that it goeth down west to Fleet Dyke, from whence men must <pb id="P.489" n="489">

 turn again the same way they came, but there it stopped.</QUOTE> There used to be a proverb, <QUOTE>He must take him a house in Turnagain Lane.</QUOTE> 
<P>A conduit formerly stood on Snow Hill, a little below the church. It is described as a building with <num value="4">four</num> equal sides, ornamented with <num value="4">four</num> columns and pediment, surmounted by a pyramid, on which stood a lamb--a rebus on the name of Lamb, from whose conduit in Red Lion Street the water came. There had been a conduit there, however, before Lamb's day, which was towards the close of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century. 
<P>At No. <num value="37">37</num>, King Street, Snow Hill, there used to be a ladies' charity school, which was established in <datestruct value="1702--"><year reg="1702">1702</year></datestruct>, and remained in the parish <num value="145">145</num> years. Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale were subscribers to this school, and Johnson drew from it his story of Betty Broom, in <title>The Idler.</title> The world of domestic service, in Betty's days, seems to have been pretty much as now. Betty was a poor girl, bred in the country at a charity-school, maintained by the contributions of wealthy neighbours. The patronesses visited the school from time to time, to see how the pupils got on, and everything went well, till <QUOTE><p>at last, the chief of the subscribers having passed a winter in London, came down full of an opinion new and strange to the whole country. She held it little less than criminal to teach poor girls to read and write. They who are born to poverty, she said, are born to ignorance, and will work the harder the less they know. She told her friends that London was in confusion by the insolence of servants; that scarcely a girl could be got for <hi rend=italics>all-work</hi>, since education had made such numbers of fine ladies, that nobody would now accept a lower title than that of a waiting-maid, or something that might qualify her to wear laced shoes and long ruffles, and to sit at work in the parlour window. But she was resolved, for her part, to spoil no more girls. Those who were to live by their hands should neither read nor write out of her pocket. The world was bad enough already, and she would have no part in making it worse. 
<P>She was for a long time warmly opposed; but she persevered in her notions, and withdrew her subscription. Few listen, without a desire of conviction, to those who advise them to spare their money. Her example and her arguments gained ground daily; and in less than a year the whole parish was convinced that the nation would be ruined if the children of the poor were taught to read and write.</QUOTE> So the school was dissolved, and Betty with the rest was turned adrift into the wide and cold world; and her adventures there any <num value="1">one</num> may read in <title>The Idler</title> for himself. 
<P>There is an entry in the school minutes of <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct>, to the effect that the ladies of the committee censured the schoolmistress for listening to the story of the Cock Lane ghost, and <QUOTE>desired her to keep her belief in the article to herself.</QUOTE> 
<P>Skinner Street-now. <num value="1">one</num> of the names of the past--which ran by the south side of St. Sepulchre's, and formed the connecting. link between Newgate Street and Holborn, received its name from <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.489.3">Alderman Skinner</LEMMA>, through whose exertions, about <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, it was principally built. The following account of Skinner Street is from the picturesque pen of Mr, William Harvey ( <QUOTE>Aleph</QUOTE> ), whose long familiarity with the places he describes renders doubly valuable his many contributions to the history of London scenes and people:-- <QUOTE>As a building speculation,</QUOTE> he says, writing in <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>it was a failure. When the buildings were ready for occupation, tall and substantial as they really were, the high rents frightened intending shopkeepers. Tenants were not to be had; and in order to get over the money difficulty, a lottery, sanctioned by Parliament, was commenced.      Lotteries were then common tricks of finance, and nobody wondered at the new venture; but even the most desperate fortune-hunters were slow to invest their capital, and the tickets hung sadly on hand. The day for the drawing was postponed several times, and when it came, there was little or no excitement on the subject, and who ever rejoiced in becoming a house-owner on such easy terms, the original projectors and builders were understood to have suffered considerably. The winners found the property in a very unfinished condition. Few of the dwellings were habitable, and as funds were often wanting, a majority of the houses remained empty, and the shops unopened. After <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> years things began to improve; the vast many-storeyed house which then covered the site of Commercial Place was converted into a warehousing depot; a capital house opposite the  <Q>Saracen's Head</Q>  was taken by a hosier of the name of Theobald, who, opening his shop with the determination of selling the best hosiery, and nothing else, was able to convince the citizens that his hose was <num value="1">first</num>-rate, and, desiring only a living profit, succeeded, after <num value="30">thirty</num> years of unwearied industry, in accumulating a large fortune. Theobald was possessed of literary tastes, and at the sale of Sir Walter Scott's manuscripts was a liberal purchaser. He also collected a library of exceed. ingly choice books, and when aristocratic customers purchased stockings of him, was soon able to interest them in matters of far higher interest. <gap>
 
<P>The most remarkable shop-but it was on the left-hand side, at a corner house--was that <pb id="P.490" n="490"> established for the sale of children's books. It boasted an immense extent of window-front, extending from   the entrance into Snow Hill, and towards Fleet Market. Many a time have I lingered with loving eyes over those fascinating story-books, so rich in gaily-coloured prints; such careful editions of the marvellous old histories,  <Q>Puss in Boots,</Q>   <Q>Cock Robin,</Q>   <Q>Cinderella,</Q>  and the like.   Fortunately the front was kept low, so as exactly to suit the capacity of a childish admirer <gap>
 But Skinner Street did not prosper much, and never could compete with even the dullest portions of Holborn.   I have spoken of some reputable shops; but you know the proverb,  <Q><num value="1">One</num> swallow will not make a summer,</Q>  and it was a declining neighbourhood almost before it could be called new. In <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct> the commercial depot, which had been erected at a cost of <measure value="25000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="25000">25,000</num></measure>, and was the chief prize in the lottery, was destroyed by fire, never to be rebuilt--a heavy blow and discouragement to Skinner Street, from which it never rallied. Perhaps the periodical hanging-days exercised an unfavourable influence, collecting, as they frequently did, all the thieves and vagabonds of London.   I never sympathised with Pepys or Charles Fox in their passion for public executions, and made it a point to avoid those ghastly sights; but early of a Monday morning, when I had just reached the end of Giltspur Street, a miserable wretch had just been turned off from the platform of the debtors' door, and I was made the unwilling witness of his last struggles. That scene haunted me for months, and I often used to ask myself,  <Q>Who that could help it would live in Skinner Street?</Q>    The next unpropitious event in these parts was the unexpected closing of the child's library. What could it mean? Such a well-to-do establishment shut up? Yes, the whole army of shutters looked blankly on the inquirer, and forbade even a single glance at  <Q>Sinbad</Q>  or  <Q>Robinson Crusoe.</Q>  It would soon be re-opened, we naturally thought; but the shutters never came down again. The whole house was deserted; not even a messenger in bankruptcy, or an ancient Charley, was found to regard the playful double knocks of the neighbouring juveniles. Gradually the glass of all the windows got broken in, a heavy cloud of black dust, solidifying into inches thick, gathered on sills and doors and brickwork, till the whole frontage grew as gloomy as Giant Despair's Castle. Not long after, the adjoining houses shared the same fate, and they remained from year to year without the slightest sign of life-absolute scarecrows, darkening with their uncomfortable shadows the busy streets. Within half a mile, in Stamford Street, Blackfriars, there are (<datestruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct>) <num value="7">seven</num> houses in a similar predicament- window-glass demolished, doors cracked from top to bottom, spiders' webs hanging from every projecting sill or parapet.   What can it mean? The loss in the article of rents alone must be over <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> annually. If the real owners are at feud with imaginary owners, surely the property might be rendered valuable, and the proceeds invested. Even the lawyers can derive no profit from such hopeless abandonment. I am told the whole mischief arose out of a Chancery suit. Can it be the famous  <Q>Jarndyce <hi rend=italics>v</hi>. Jarndyce</Q>  case? And have all the heirs starved each other out? If so, what hinders our lady the Queen from taking possession? Any change would be an improvement, for these dead houses make the streets they cumber as dispiriting and comfortless as graveyards. Busy fancy will sometimes people them, and fill the dreary rooms with strange guests. Do the victims of guilt congregate in these dark dens?   Do wretches  <Q>unfriended by the world or the world's law,</Q>  seek refuge in these deserted nooks, mourning in the silence of despair over their former lives, and anticipating the future in unappeasable agony? Such things have been--the silence and desolation of these doomed dwellings make them   the more suitable for such tenants.</QUOTE>
 
<P>A street is nothing without a mystery, so a mystery let these old tumble-down houses remain, whilst we go on to tell that, in front of No. <num value="58">58</num>, the sailor Cashman was hung in <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>, as we have already mentioned, for plundering a gunsmith's shop there. William Godwin, the author of <title>Caleb Williams,</title> kept a bookseller's shop for several years in Skinner Street, at No. <num value="41">41</num>, and published school-books in the name of Edward Baldwin.   On the wall there was a stone carving of AEsop reciting <num value="1">one</num> of his fables to children. 
<P>The most noteworthy event of the life of Godwin was his marriage with the celebrated Mary Wollstonecraft, authoress of a <title>Vindication of the Rights of Women,</title> whose congenial mind, in politics and morals, he ardently admired. Godwin's account of the way in which they got on together is worth reading :-- <QUOTE>Ours,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE>was not an idle happiness, a paradise of selfish and transitory pleasures.   It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary to mention, that influenced by ideas I had long entertained, I engaged an apartment about <num value="20">twenty</num> doors from our house, in the Polygon, Somers Town, which I designed for the purpose of my study. and literary occupations. Trifles, however, will be interesting to some readers, when they relate to the last period of the life of such a person as Mary. I will add, therefore, that we were both <pb id="P.491" n="491"> of us of opinion, that it was possible for <num value="2">two</num> persons to be too uniformly in each other's society. Influenced by that opinion, it was my practice to repair to the apartment I have mentioned as soon as I rose, and frequently not to make my appearance in the Polygon till the hour of dinner. We agreed in condemning the notion, prevalent in many situations in life, that a man and his wife cannot visit in mixed society but in company with each other, and we rather sought occasions of deviating from than of complying with this rule. By this means, though, for the most part, we spent the latter half of each day in <num value="1">one</num> another's society, yet we were in no danger of satiety. We seemed to combine, in a considerable degree, the novelty and lively sensation of a visit with the more delicious and heartfelt pleasure of a domestic life.</QUOTE> 
<P>This philosophic union, to Godwin's inexpressible affliction, did not last more than eighteen months, at the end of which time Mrs. Godwin died, leaving an only daughter, who in the course of time became the <num value="2">second</num> wife of the poet Shelley, and was the author of the wild and extraordinary tale of <title>Frankenstein.</title>

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 

 
<P>Before the establishment of the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.491.2">new meat and poultry market in Smithfield</LEMMA>,   London was behind every city of Europe in respect of public markets. For <num value="7">seven</num> centuries, dating from <datestruct value="1150--"><year reg="1150">1150</year></datestruct>, Smithfield has been used as a market for live stock. Latterly, the dirt and crowd, and the rushes of horned beasts, had become intolerable, and after much opposition from vested interests, an Act of Parliament was passed in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, under the provisions of which a new and convenient cattle-market was constructed by the Corporation out to the quiet north, in Copenhagen Fields, once the resort of Cockney lovers, Cockney duellists, and Cockney agitators. 
<P> <QUOTE>At the opening of the Meat-market by the Prince Consort, in <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> says the <title>Times</title> of <datestruct VALUE="1868-11-25"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=25>25</day>, <year reg=1868>1868</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>Smithfield became waste ground. The arrangements at Copenhagen Fields are about as good for their purpose as any that could have been desired; but since the time the market there was laid out there have been very great changes in respect of the supply of animal food for the population of the metropolis. Then most of the beasts and sheep converted into meat for sale in the shops of London butchers were brought to London alive and slaughtered by the retailers.   With the development of our railway system, and the additions to the great main lines by extensions which brought them into the business parts of the metropolis, the dead meat traffic from the provinces exhibited year by year a heavier tonnage. But the Cattle Plague, and the consequent restrictions to the removal from <num value="1">one</num> county to another of live stock which might communicate or become infected with the disease, brought about something like a revolution in our food supply; and at the present time not less than about <num value="100000">100,000</num> tons of dead meat are brought into the London market from all parts of the country. The centre to which all this immense quantity of meat has hitherto been consigned is Newgate Market.   Here has been conducted an enormous wholesale trade between the salesmen, to whom the country dealers, nearly <num value="300">300</num> in number, consign their meat, and retail butchers scattered all over London and its suburbs who do not slaughter for themselves.   In addition, Newgate Market has been from time immemorial the principal retail meat market--a circumstance which may be attributed to the fact that it has the reputation of being cheaper than all others by <measure value="1d." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>d.</measure> or <measure value="2d." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>d.</measure> in the pound. Now, in modern London, it would be difficult to find any site more inconvenient for such a double trade than that of Newgate Market. The whole business has had to be done within the very limited space of which Paternoster Row, Ivy Lane, Newgate Street, and the Old Bailey are the boundaries.   Last Christmas week <num value="800">800</num> tons of meat were brought to London for the Newgate Market by the Great Eastern, the Great Northern, and the Midland railways. This, and the consignments by all the other lines, had to be conveyed to the market from the railway stations in wagons and vans. These vehicles, and the butchers' carts, completely block up Giltspur Street, Newgate Street, and the Old Bailey on several days in the week, Mondays and Fridays especially.</QUOTE> 
<P>Through the filthy lanes and alleys no <num value="1">one</num> could <pb id="P.492" n="492"> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.492" n="2000.07.0175"><HEAD>Map Of Farringdon Ward Without, <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="P.493" n="493"> pass without being either butted with the dripping end of a quarter of beef, or smeared by the greasy carcase of a newly-slain sheep. In many of the narrow lanes there was hardly room for <num value="2">two</num> persons to pass abreast. Nevertheless, till the extension of the railway system, there was a difficulty in constructing a meat-market worthy of London, from the size of the great city.   A good meat-market must be open to access from all quarters. Some years ago, when beef and mutton were far dearer in outlying shops than in Newgate Market itself, the inconvenient position, and the difficulty of reaching it, compelled persons of moderate means to be taxed elsewhere, rather than face the dirt and bustle of Newgate.   The Corporation, therefore, at last resolved on providing a new market in Smithfield, in order to utilise a waste, and develop the meat trade throughout the kingdom. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct> the Corporation obtained an Act for erecting market buildings on the site of Smithfield, and the following year procured another, giving them   power to abolish Newgate Market.   The Markets Improvement Committee then took the matter in hand, and Mr. Horace Jones, the City architect, prepared a fitting design. Their parlia- 
<FIGURE id="Fig.493" n="2000.07.0176"><HEAD>The Metropolitan Meat Market.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 mentary powers enabled the committee to raise a sum of   <measure value="235000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="235000">235,000</num></measure> for the purchase of property, and   <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure> for the erection of buildings. The Markets Improvement Committee concluded their contract with Messrs. Browne and Robinson for a sum within the estimated amount of <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure>. The chief element of the design was that the basement storey of the market was to be a <QUOTE>through</QUOTE> railway-station, with communication not only from all parts of the country, but also with all the suburban lines. 
<P>The tremendous excavations soon began on a Roman scale of grandeur. About <num value="3500000">3,500,000</num> loads of earth, weighing about <num value="172000">172,000</num> tons, had to be loosened and removed. <num value="21">Twenty-one</num> main girders, of Titanic strength, were carried across the entire width of the excavation, <num value="240">240</num> feet, on wrought-iron stanchions. On these main girders cross girders were laid, <num value="2">2</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches deep, and <num value="7">7</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches apart. Between the latter brick arches were turned, and concrete and asphalte were set in stone, to form a roof for the railway, and a bedding for the wood pavement of the building. 
<P>In these foundations were <num value="5">five</num> miles of iron girding, carried on no fewer than <num value="180">180</num> <pb id="P.494" n="494"> wroughtiron stanchions, while substantial retaining walls rose all around. 
<P>The <num value="1">first</num> stone of this well-planned market was laid on the <datestruct VALUE="1867-06-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct>, by Mr. Lowman Taylor, the chairman of the committee. In March the central area was given up to the contractors. The market is a huge parallelogram, <num value="631">631</num> feet long and <num value="246">246</num> feet wide, and covers <num value="3">three</num> and a half acres. It is not over-beautiful, but then its necessities were peculiar and imperative.   The style would probably be called Italian, but it resembles more the Renaissance of France, that style which mediaevalists shudder at, but which is more elastic in the architect's hands than the Gothic. The prevailing feature of the style is a series of arcaded recesses between Doric pilasters, fluted on the upper <num value="2">two</num> triads, and elevated on pedestals. The entablature is returned and ornamented over the pilasters, with vase-like finials. The external wall is <num value="32">32</num> feet high.   Between the Portland stone pilasters are recesses of red brickwork. The semi-circular heads of the arches are filled in with rich iron scrolls, which let in the light and air freely. 
<P>The keystones of the arches are richly carved, especially those over the <num value="12">twelve</num> side entrances. Under the iron openings are windows, with stone sills, trusses, architraves, and cornices.   At the angles of the building rise <num value="4">four</num> handsome towers of Portland stone.   The lower storey of each octagonal tower is a square, with double pilasters at the corners, and a carved pediment on each face. Above this height the towers are octagonal. The square and the octagonal portions are joined by the huge couchant stone griffins of the City arms.   On each side of the octagon are windows, with carved friezes.   The dome of each tower is pierced on <num value="4">four</num> sides by dormer windows, and above is a lantern, surrounded by an ornamental railing. The finest <hi rend=italics>coup d&lsquo;oeil</hi> of the building, architectural critics think, are the <num value="2">two</num> facades of the fine public roadway which runs across the market, and divides it into equal parts.   The roadway is <num value="50">50</num> feet wide between the double piers, which carry a richly-moulded elliptical arch and cast-iron pediment, and over each double pier is an emblematic figure in Portland stone, representing <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="4">four</num> principal cities of the United Kingdom. At the south front London and Edinburgh stand confessed, and on the north are Dublin and Liverpool. The sides of the outer roadway are shut off from the market by an elaborate open iron-work screen, <num value="14">14</num> feet high, and at the intersection of the central avenue, east and west, the market is closed by ornamented iron gates, with iron spandrils and semi-circular heads similar to those in the arcade. Towards the north a gate gives access, by a double staircase, to the railway department below. The gates at the east and west entrances (the chief) are <num value="25">25</num> feet high, and <num value="19">19</num> feet wide, and each pair weighs <num value="15">15</num> tons. They are formed of wrought ironwork, elaborately scrolled. The central avenue, a large inner street, is <num value="27">27</num> feet wide, and has <num value="6">six</num> side avenues. The shops are ranged on either side of this great thoroughfare. There is <num value="1">one</num> bay at the east end of the market for game and poultry, but no fish or vegetables can be sold. The shops are of cast-iron, with light columns and lattice girders, and which, by brackets, serve to carry the rails and meat-hooks. There are about <num value="162">162</num> shops in the market, each about <num value="36">36</num> feet by <num value="15">15</num> feet, and behind every shop is an enclosed counting-house, with private apartments overhead.   To   secure light and air the Mansard roof has been used. The broad glass louvres of this system let in the air and keep out the sun; the result is that the interior of the building is generally <num value="10">ten</num> degrees cooler than the temperature in the shade outside. There are <num value="12">twelve</num> hydrants on the floor-level. It was planned that when the meat which arrived by rail reached the depot underneath the market, it should be raised to the level of the floorway by powerful hydraulic lifts. The Metropolitan, the Midland, the London, Chatham, and Dover, and the Great Western Railways have direct communication with the depot.   The passenger trains of the Metropolitan, Great Northern, Midland, and Chatham   and Dover Companies rush through every <num value="2">two</num> minutes, and the Great Western Company have an extensive receiving-store there. It was thought that if it were deemed desirable there would be no difficulty in making a passenger station right under the market. 
<P>For the ceremony of opening, in <datestruct VALUE="1868-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>, a raised dais was erected in the eastern nave, and the public roadway dividing the market was fitted up as a magnificent banqueting-room. On both sides and at either end streamed rich scarlet draperies, and within the gate there were paintings and ornaments in white and gold-work. The temporary entrance was at the end of the eastern avenue.   Opposite it was a scarlet sideboard, glowing with gold plate, and crowned with a trophy of lances. A table for the Lord Mayor and chief guests was placed in front of the sideboard, and <num value="24">twenty-four</num> other tables, on which there were flowers and fruit, and covers for <num value="1200">1,200</num> people, ran in a transverse direction from the Lord Mayor's seat. Over the entrance was an orchestra for the band of the Grenadier Guards, led by that enthusiast of good time, Mr. Dan Godfrey. Jets of gas were <pb id="P.495" n="495"> carried along the elliptical roof girders, in simple lines, and in arches over the screen of open ironwork that shuts off the market from the roadway. <num value="3000">Three thousand</num> yards of gas-piping fed a number of candelabra and a centre star-light. There were <num value="4">four</num> carvers, in Guildhall dignity, who, mounted on high pedestals, carved barons of beef and boars' heads. The Lord Mayor's footmen shone in gold lace, and the City trumpeter and toastmaster also dignified the feast by their attendance. The ceremony of opening the market was simple enough. The Lord Mayor arrived in state from the Mansion House, and was received by Mr. H. Lowman Taylor and the Markets Improvement Committee, at the east end of the building, and conducted to the dais, where his lordship received a number of provincial mayors, members of Parliament, &amp;c. The speakers at the banquet congratulated each other on the rapidity with which the market had been built, and hoped it would bring tolls to the Corporation, cheap meat to the people, and fair profits to the salesmen. Mr. Lowman Taylor considered the old market well replaced by the new building, with its ample thoroughfares, and trusted that the new rents and tolls would bring the Corporation exchequer a fair return for the <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure> which the new building had cost. It was designed to supply <num value="3000000">3,000,000</num> with food. 
<P> <QUOTE>The interior of the market,</QUOTE> says a writer at the time of the opening, <QUOTE>has been of necessity even more subservient to the purposes of the building than the exterior.   <num value="1">One</num> of the leading features in the arrangements is that for securing light without sunshine, and free ventilation without exposure to rain. During the excessive heat of last summer the effect was tested by thermometers placed in various parts of the building, and the result found to be highly satisfactory. The upper parts of the roof all over the building are of wood, and communicate with other portions of the fabric, which are also of wood. In the event of fire it would probably spread with terrific rapidity through the building. The wooden portions of the roof have also the effect of throwing the avenues somewhat into shade. The shops are arranged on each side of the side avenues which cross the market from north to south, and intersect the central avenue. The latter is <num value="27">27</num> feet wide, and the <num value="6">six</num> side avenues <num value="18">18</num> feet wide each. The backs of the shops are closed in, but at the sides are screened by light ironwork to ensure ventilation. The floor of the market is paved with blocks. <num value="12">Twelve</num> hydrants, always at high pressure, will supply ample means of washing out the market avenues and stalls, and could be used in case of fire.</QUOTE> 
<P>This great market has proved a decided success. An official report issued this year (<datestruct value="1874"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>) shows that the total amount of toll paid for all descriptions of produce brought into the market has risen from <measure value="14220l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="14220">14,220</num></measure> <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> <num value="6">6</num> d. in <datestruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct> to <measure value="16818l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="16818">16,818</num></measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> <measure value="10.50d." type=currency><num value="10.50">10 1/2</num>d.</measure> in <datestruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct>. The total receipts for both tolls and rentals were <measure value="51165l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="51165">51,165</num></measure> <measure value="18s." type=currency><num value="18">18</num>s.</measure> <measure value="1.50d." type=currency><num value="1.50">1 1/2</num>d.</measure> in <datestruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></datestruct> as against <measure value="51089l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="51089">51,089</num></measure> <measure value="1s. 3d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="3">3</num>d.</measure> during <datestruct value="1872--"><year reg="1872">1872</year></datestruct>. There is a large and increasing demand for accommodation; so much so, indeed, that whenever there is a vacant shop, it is besieged by <num value="20">twenty</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> tradesmen, eager to become tenants, and a place in the market is considered quite a prize amongst salesmen. It is anticipated that there will soon be a farther demand on the space at Smithfield, in consequence of the Act prohibiting private slaughter-houses coming into operation, as many of the Whitechapel butchers will then desire to come here. This being the case, it was some time since resolved to erect a new market immediately west of the Meat Market, to be devoted to the poultry, game, and cognate trades. 
<P>This new structure which the Fathers of the City propose to bestow upon their children is rapidly approaching completion. It is, as regards architecture, in harmony with the Meat Market, and that it will be as successful as regards trade can hardly be doubted.   The traffic in London in poultry and game possesses many features of interest, and a few facts respecting the business done at Smithfield in these luxuries of the table may be worth noting. The following newspaper account may be rescued, on account of its merits, from that oblivion which so generally attends most of the-ephemeral productions of the press:--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>The  <Q>foreign</Q>  branch of the poultry and game business is the most curious. The greater part of the eatable ornithology of Smithfield, in this department, is derived from Ireland and France. The Belgian pig, as an eatable subject, has' lately been beating his Irish brother, and it may be made another subject for an Irish grievance that the French goose has of late years become a formidable rival of his fellow-geese from the Emerald Isle.   Formerly there was a prejudice against French geese; the trade would not look at them, and the public would not eat them. But gastronomical prejudices are short-lived. Whether it is due to the soothing influence of sage and onions or to the quality of the noble bird itself, it is certain now that the French goose is very popular on this side of the Channel, for the poulterers say that they sell large numbers of them   at good prices.   Indeed, so successful is the French goose, that large numbers of his race are imported into England in an attenuated condition during the summer, and are sent <pb id="P.496" n="496"> into the country to be fattened for the London market at Michaelmas.   But remoter lands than France supply us with birds for the table. We get an abundance of prairie hens and canvas-back ducks from the United States. These are frozen by machinery on the other side of the Atlantic, packed in barrels, and brought over in capital condition.   From Norway we receive ptarmigan, black-cock, and that eatable eagle, the capercailzie. They are sent over in the winter, frozen naturally, in cases containing from <num value="80">eighty</num> to a <num value="100">hundred</num> each, being shipped at Christiansund, landed at Hull, and brought up to town by rail. Holland is good enough to send us, sometimes by <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> baskets of <num value="200">two hundred</num> each in <num value="1">one</num> steamer, her delicious wild ducks, and those curious little birds called ruffs and rees, which are about the size of godwits, and the male of which has most wonderful plumage, with a pretty crown of grey feathers on his head, given him to make him look handsome at courting time.   But our most curious importation is the quail from Egypt, which feeds us to this day, as it fed the Israelites in the desert, and is brought over alive, in consignments of from <num value="30">thirty</num> to <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num>.   These birds are shipped at Alexandria, and are sent to Marseilles in charge of a native attendant to minister to their bodily wants. Thence they are  <Q>railed</Q>  across France in cages, lodged for a time in Smithfield, and then dispersed to all parts of the kingdom. So carefully are they transported, that not more than <num value="7">seven</num> per cent. of them perish by the way. From birds it is a natural transition to eggs, and there is an enormous market for plovers' eggs at Smithfield. They come chiefly from   Holland--the home produce being very small-and they are received during the spring and summer from   March to June.   The <num value="1">first</num> plovers' eggs of the season invariably go to the Queen's poulterer, for Her Majesty's table, and fetch from <num value="7">seven</num> to <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure> apiece. 
<P>Besides all this foreign produce, there is, of course, an immense home trade, and of the English poultry, which comes principally from   Surrey, Devonshire, Lincolnshire, and Suffolk, much might be said.   No wonder the poulterers are getting crowded out of their small corner of Smithfield Market, and are eager for a market of their own where they will have some scope for the development of their business.   The trade generally is favourable to removal, and it is likely to act as a severe drain on Leadenhall, if not to shut it up altogether, although it is said there is a knot of very conservative poulterers who vow that they will never desert the old place, come what may.</QUOTE>

</LIST></ARGUMENT>
 
<P>It is convenient here to devote a paragraph to the general subject of the ward--that of Farringdon Without--in which we now find ourselves. <QUOTE>The whole great Ward of Farindon,</QUOTE> says Stow, <QUOTE>both intra and extra (i.e., within and without the walls), took name of W. Farindon, goldsmith, alderman of that ward, and <num value="1">one</num> of the sheriffs of London in the year <datestruct value="1281"><year reg="1281">1281</year></datestruct>, the <num value="9">9th</num> of Edward I. He purchased the aldermanry of this ward.</QUOTE> Farringdon Without is by far the largest of all the <num value="26">twenty-six</num> wards of London. Its general boundaries are--on the north, Holborn and Smithfield; on the south, the Thames, between Blackfriars Bridge and the Temple Stairs; on the east, New Bridge Street and the Old Bailey; and on the west, Temple Bar and Chancery Lane. The notorious John Wilkes was chosen alderman of this ward on the <datestruct VALUE="1769-01-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1769">1769</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>while yet,</QUOTE> says Walpole, <QUOTE>a criminal of State and a prisoner.</QUOTE> He was at this time immensely popular with a large party in the City of London, and the election established that connection with the metropolis which was afterwards so profitable to him. This violent politician seems to have exercised a powerful fascination over those he met, by his wit, happy temperament, and tact, and no doubt much of his success with the clear-headed mercantile community of London arose from this. Lord Mansfield, who <pb id="P.497" n="497"> had no reason to like him, was once heard to remark, <QUOTE>that he was the pleasantest companion, the politest gentleman, and the best scholar he ever knew.</QUOTE> He excited great admiration by his fertility in expedients. <QUOTE>If,</QUOTE> said <num value="1">one</num> who knew him, <QUOTE>he were stripped and thrown over Westminster Bridge <num value="1">one</num> day, you would meet him the next in Pall Mall, dressed in the height of fashion, and with money in his pocket.</QUOTE> 
<P>Farringdon Without has been famous for its banking connections.   The founders of the <num value="3">three</num> rich banking-houses in Fleet Street--the Childs, the Hoares, and the Goslings-filled at various periods the office of alderman of this ward. 
<P>The companion ward of Farringdon Within, out of which we passed when we left-speaking of Christ's Hospital, has for its general boundaries, on the north, Christ's Hospital (in the hall of which the wardmotes are held), and part of Cheapside; on the south, the Thames; on the east, Cheapside; and on the west, New Bridge Street. 
<P>Farringdon Street, which runs from Bridge Street northward to the line of Holborn, is constructed over the celebrated Fleet; Ditch.   In this street stood Fleet Market. To understand the history of this market the reader must recall what we said when speaking of the Mansion House, that it was erected on the site of the old Stocks Market (see Vol. I., p. <num value="436">436</num>). When that happened, about <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>, and Fleet Ditch was arched over, the business of the Stocks Market was transferred to the ground above the ditch, now called, as we have mentioned, Farringdon Street. Such was the origin of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.497.1">Fleet Market</LEMMA>. It was opened for the sale of meat, fish and vegetables on the <datestruct VALUE="1737-09-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>; but it did not complete a century of existence here. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct> it was found necessary to widen the thoroughfare from Holborn to Blackfriars Bridge; so Fleet Market was removed from   Farringdon Street, and <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.497.2">Farringdon Market</LEMMA>, in the immediate vicinity, but off the line of the street, was opened in its stead. The site of this comparatively neglected mart covers an acre and a half of ground, and was built by William Montague, the City architect. It has Stonecutter Street for its southern boundary. The cost of the site and buildings was about <measure value="250000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="250000">250,000</num></measure>. The following description of the market is of the date of its being opened for business, on the <datestruct VALUE="1829-11-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct> :-- <QUOTE>It forms a handsome and elevated quadrangle, of <num value="232">232</num> feet by <num value="150">150</num> feet. The purchase of the ground, and the buildings which stood thereon, is estimated in round numbers at <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure>; the building of the market, including paviours' accounts, &amp;c., is stated at <measure value="80000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="80000">80,000</num></measure>. The avenue under which are the shops of the dealers, and which extends round <num value="3">three</num> sides of the building, is <num value="25">25</num> feet high, to what are technically termed the tie-beams, with ventilators ranged at equal distances. <gap> In the centre of the roof of the principal avenue a turret and clock have been placed. <gap> The chief entrance to the market is by <num value="2">two</num> gates, for wagons, &amp;c., in Stonecutter Street, which has been made double its former width, and <num value="2">two</num> smaller ones for footpassengers; besides these, on each side of the quadrangle, massive oak doors are to be thrown open, from morning till the close of public business.</QUOTE> 
<P>But careful building and liberal outlay seemed only thrown away. At a meeting of the Court of Common Council, held on the <datestruct VALUE="1874-06-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>, to consider the advisability of reconstructing the market, it was stated that the receipts during the last <num value="5">five</num> years had only averaged <measure value="225l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="225">225</num></measure>.   No wonder, then, that the court exhibited very little inclination to expend more money on a site which, exceedingly valuable as it would prove for other purposes, seems little suited for that of a market. 
<P> <QUOTE>Many persons,</QUOTE> says a recent writer, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>are of opinion that it is desirable to maintain the old Farringdon   Market.   In fact, the Corporation lately invited designs for its improvement, and have actually awarded prizes for the best. There can be no doubt that Farringdon Market, as it stands, is in a very bad position.   It is quite behind the times in the matter of accommodation, and the gradients by which access to it is gained are so steep that accidents to carts and horses not infrequently happen. It may be open to improvement by the alteration of the levels as proposed, but the latest disposition of the Corporation appears to be to leave the old market to its fate, and build a new <num value="1">one</num> west of that now in process of construction at Smithfield, a course which certainly would have many advantages. As regards the existing market, it may be said to do a fairish middle-class trade. Its produce, however, is very humble, and rarely rises above the rank of the modest onion, the plebeian cabbage, the barely respectable cauliflower, the homely apple, and other unpretending fruits and vegetables. Pineapples and hot-house grapes are unknown to its dingy sheds, and, as a sorrowing tradesman remarked,  <Q>We never see such things as pears at <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure> a dozen!</Q>  The market for vegetables, in fact, is supplied chiefly from the gardens in the immediate vicinity of London, say within a <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> miles' radius, while the fruit comes almost exclusively from Kent. The more important supplies, from distant parts of the country, go to Covent <pb id="P.498" n="498"> Garden and the Borough.   It is supposed that a better class trade would be done at Smithfield, but this is a disputed point. 
<P>In <num value="1">one</num> commodity Farringdon does a great business. It is <hi rend=italics>the</hi> market, <hi rend=italics>par excellence</hi>, for watercresses.   Of these there are about a score of vendors in the market, and sometimes as much as <num value="20">twenty</num> tons a week are brought up for sale. The general market opens at <num value="4">four</num> am., but the retailers of the watercress are allowed to enter an hour earlier, and they flock thither-men, women, boys, and girls-by hundreds at a time.   The <Q>watercreases</Q> are brought in hampers, and in smaller baskets, called pads and flats. The toll for a hamper is twopence, and for a pad or flat <num value="1">one</num> penny.   The pleasant vegetable is sold by the  <Q>end,</Q>  the  <Q> middle,</Q>  and the  <Q> side</Q>  of the basketthose in the middle, as they are, of course, fresher than the rest, fetching the best price. The value of a hamper of watercresses is sometimes as high as <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure>, and as low as <num value="5">five</num>, that of a pad or flat being half as much. But the most popular way of buying watercresses is  <Q>by the hand;</Q>  that is, the salesman sells as many handfuls--of his 
<hi rend=italics>own</hi> hand, of course--as may be equivalent to the 
<FIGURE id="Fig.498" n="2000.07.0177"><HEAD>Fleet Market. (From A Drawing In Mr. Gardiner's Collection.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 market value of a shilling. The price ranges from <num value="12">twelve</num> to eighteen hands; but the buyer is always careful to see that he or she gets proper measure, calculated in a rough-and-ready sort of fashion, and <num value="1">one</num> often hears the admonition,  <Q> Don't pinch your hand, governor.</Q> </QUOTE>
 
<P>A visit to Farringdon Market in early morning, Mr. Henry Mayhew holds, is the proper way to form an estimate of the fortitude, courage, and perseverance of the poor. These watercress sellers are members of a class so poverty-stricken that their extreme want alone would almost justify them in taking to thieving, yet they can be trusted to pay the few pence they owe, even though hunger should pinch them for it. As Douglas Jerrold has truly said, <QUOTE>there is goodness, like wild honey, hived in strange nooks and corners of the earth.</QUOTE> It must require no little energy of conscience on the part of the lads to make them resist the temptations around them, and refuse the cunning advice of the young thieves they meet at their cheap lodging-houses. Yet they prefer the early rising, the walk to market with naked feet over the cold stones, and the chance of earning a few pence by a day of honest labour, to all the comparative ease <pb id="P.499" n="499"> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.499" n="2000.07.0178"><HEAD>Field Lane About <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="P.500" n="500"> of a career of fraud. <QUOTE>The heroism of the unknown poor,</QUOTE> adds Mr. Mayhew, <QUOTE>is a thing to set even the dullest marvelling, and in no place in all London is the virtue of the humblest-both young and old-so conspicuous as amongst the watercress buyers at Farringdon Market.</QUOTE> 
<P>Mr. Mayhew visited it <datestruct value="11-1"><day reg="1">one</day> <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct> morning. The poor, he says, were there, in every style of rags, laying in the necessary stock for their trade. <QUOTE>As the morning twilight drew on, the paved court was crowded with customers. The sheds and shops at the   and of the market grew every moment more distinct, and a railway van, laden with carrots, came rumbling into the yard. The pigeons, too, began to fly into the sheds, or walk about the paving-stones, and the gas-man came round with his ladder to turn out the lamps. Then every <num value="1">one</num> was pushing about, the children crying as their naked feet were trodden upon, and the women hurrying off with their baskets or shawls filled with cresses, and the bunch of rushes in their hands. In <num value="1">one</num> corner of the market, busily tying up their bunches, were <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> girls, seated on the stones, with their legs curled up under them, and the ground near them was green with the leaves they had thrown away. A saleswoman, seeing me looking at the group, said,  <Q> Ah, you should come here of a summer's morning, and then you'd see &lsquo;em, sitting tying up, young and old, upwards of a <num value="100">hundred</num> poor things, as thick as crows in a ploughed field.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P>On the east side of Farringdon Street, and on a part of the site of the old Fleet Prison, stands the 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.500.1">Congregational Memorial Hall and Library</LEMMA>, a handsome new building, the foundation-stone of which was laid on the <datestruct VALUE="1872-05-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1872">1872</year></datestruct>. This hall has been erected by the Congregationalists of England and Wales, in commemoration of the ejection from their charges, <num value="200">two hundred</num> years ago--it was on the <datestruct VALUE="1662-08-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>-of more than <num value="2000">two thousand</num> ministers of the Church of England, because they could not conscientiously subscribe to the Act of Uniformity. The ground purchased in Farringdon Street consisted of <num value="9000">9,000</num> feet of freehold land, with <num value="84">84</num> feet frontage to the main road, and <num value="32">32</num> feet to old Fleet Lane, and having a depth of about   <num value="100">100</num> feet. It cost <measure value="28000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="28000">28,000</num></measure>. The design for the memorial building, prepared by Mr. Tarring, comprised a hall capable of holding <num value="1200">1,200</num> to <num value="1500">1,500</num> people; a library, with accommodation for <num value="300">300</num>; a board-room, and <num value="25">twenty-five</num> other offices, which it was calculated would be amply sufficient for all the societies connected with the denomination in London. 
<P>We   come now to speak of <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest and most successful works ever undertaken in the city of London--the Holborn Valley improvements, an undertaking which will ever be quoted as a notable example of the energy and public spirit of our time. We have already spoken of the inconvenience and disagreeableness of the approach to the City from the west by Holborn.   To avoid the dangerous descent of Holborn Hill, it was at last resolved to construct a viaduct and high-level bridge over Farringdon Street, and so to supplant Skinner Street, and form a spacious and pleasant thoroughfare connecting the City with that great Mediterranean of western traffic, Holborn and Oxford Street. This was done after long consultation, the consideration of many different schemes, and many attempts, not always successful, to reconcile conflicting interests. The works were commenced in <datestruct VALUE="1863-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct>, and if it was more than <num value="6">six</num> years before the valley was bridged over, and the viaduct opened to the public, we must consider the gigantic nature of the undertaking, and the delays in effecting the demolition of the old structures and roadway, embarrassed, too, by much litigation. The cost of the improvements con. siderably exceeded <num value="2">two</num> millions. 
<P>The scheme was originally calculated to cost about <measure value="1500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1500000">1,500,000</num></measure>, the Corporation recouping themselves to the extent of from <measure value="600000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="600000">600,000</num></measure> or <measure value="700000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="700000">700,000</num></measure>, by the sale of building land on the sides of the new viaduct. It was resolved to remove the whole of the houses and shops on the south side of Skinner Street, Snow Hill, from the Old Bailey to Farringdon Street, and thence to the summit of Holborn Hill, while all the houses on the northern side were to be removed, enormous sums being paid in compensation--in <num value="1">one</num> case alone about <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure> being awarded. 
<P>The central object of this scheme was a stately and substantial viaduct across the Holborn Valley, between Hatton Garden and the western end of Newgate Street. A new street was also to open from opposite Hatton Garden, and pass by the back of St. Andrew's Church, to Shoe Lane, which was to be widened as far as Stonecutter Street. Thence another new line of street, <num value="50">fifty</num> feet wide, and with easy gradients, was to be formed at the east end of Fleet Street, near its junction with Farringdon Street. The viaduct across Holborn Hill was to be <num value="80">eighty</num> feet wide, and was to commence at the west end of Newgate Street.

 <pb id="P.501" n="501"> busy line of Farringdon Street below. The improvement is so grand and yet so simple, and the direction taken by the new road is so obviously the easiest and the best, that difficulties of construction and engineering details are in a manner lost sight of, and it is not until the work concealed from the eye is dived into, that the true nature of the undertaking is understood.   To know what has been accomplished, and to appreciate it rightly, the observer must leave the upper level, and penetrate the interior; to comprehend his subject, he must do as all patient learners do-commence at the foundation. 
<P>The problem that the engineer had to work out appears at <num value="1">first</num> sight a simple <num value="1">one</num>.   The postulates were a bridge crossing the great artery of Farringdon Street, and a level causeway on either side from Holborn to Newgate Street.   Then came considerations of detail that soon assumed a complex and difficult shape. Sewers, and gas, and water-pipes had to be carried, levels to be regarded, and connection with lateral thoroughfares had to be maintained.   Then arose questions of modes of construction. Obviously, a solid embankment was not possible, and an open arcade would be a waste of valuable space. So the design gradually shaped itself into what may be briefly and accurately described as a plan consisting of <num value="2">two</num> lateral passages, <num value="1">one</num> on either side supporting the pavement, and cross arches, forming vaults between, and carrying the carriage roadway above. 
<P>As the great depth of the Holborn Valley caused the viaduct to be of considerable height at its point of crossing Farringdon Street, the engineer took advantage of this to subdivide his vaulted passages into storeys, and these accordingly are <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="2">two</num>, or <num value="3">three</num>, as the dip of the level permits. <num value="1">First</num> is appropriated a space for areas and vaulted cellars of the houses, and then against these is at top a subway, in which are the gas, water, and telegraph pipes; then a passage, and below these a vaulted chamber constructed with damp-proof courses through its walls, and of considerable depth, at the bottom of which, resting on a concrete bed, is the sewer. <gap>
 
<P>The height of these subways is <num value="11">11</num>   feet <num value="6">6</num> inches, and their width <num value="7">7</num> feet. They are constructed of brickwork, excepting where carried over the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, at which point they are of tubular form, and are constructed of iron. <gap>
 
<P>The subways contain ventilating shafts, which are connected with trapped gullies in the roadway above; also with the pedestals of the lamp-posts, perforated for the purpose, and with flues expressly directed to be left in party-walls of buildings; all. these contrivances being made for the carrying off gases that may escape, especially from leakage from the gas-mains.      Provision is made for the easy ingress of workmen and materials, and the subways are lighted by means of gratings filled with globules of thick glass.</QUOTE>
 
<P>The great ornamental feature of the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.501.1">Viaduct</LEMMA> is the bridge across Farringdon Street. Unfortunately for the effect, it is a skew-bridge--that is, it crosses the street obliquely-but the design is rich and striking.   It is a cast-iron girder-bridge, in <num value="3">three</num> spans, divided by the <num value="6">six</num> granite piers which carry the girders.   These piers are massive hexagonal shafts of polished red granite, resting on bases of black granite, and having capitals of grey granite with bronze leaves, the outer piers being, however, carried above the railing on the parapet of the bridge, and terminating in pedestals, on which are placed colossal bronze statues. These statues represent Commerce and Agriculture on the south, and Science and Fine Art on the north side.   The iron palisading consists of circular panels united by scrolls, and bearing emblazonings of civic crests and devices, with the City arms on a larger scale. At the <num value="4">four</num> corners of the bridge, and forming an intrinsic part of the design, are lofty houses, of ornate Renaissance character, within which are carried flights of steps, giving means of communication to pedestrians between the level of the Viaduct and that of Farringdon Street. The fronts of these houses are adorned with the statues of <num value="4">four</num> civic worthies of the olden time.   On the north are Sir Hugh Middleton (born <datestruct value="1555--"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct>, died <datestruct value="1631--"><year reg="1631">1631</year></datestruct>) and Sir William Walworth (Mayor <datestruct value="1374--"><year reg="1374">1374</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1380--"><year reg="1380">1380</year></datestruct>); and on the south are Henry Fitz-Eylwin (Mayor <datestruct value="1189--"><year reg="1189">1189</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1212--"><year reg="1212">1212</year></datestruct>) and Sir Thomas Gresham (born <datestruct value="1519--"><year reg="1519">1519</year></datestruct>, died <datestruct value="1579--"><year reg="1579">1579</year></datestruct>). 
<P>On the south side of the Viaduct are the new station of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, and the new <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.501.2">Congregational City Temple</LEMMA>, erected by the congregation of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.501.3">Dr. Joseph Parker</LEMMA>.    The latter is in a light Italian style of architecture. The chapel has its floor on a level with the roadway of the Viaduct, and is seated for <num value="2500">2,500</num> persons. Underneath it are spacious school and class-rooms, entering from Shoe Lane. Dr. Parker's congregation used to meet in the old chapel in the Poultry, but that building was found too small; it was therefore sold, and the present <num value="1">one</num> was erected, at a cost of <measure value="60000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="60000">60,000</num></measure>, including the price (<measure value="25000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="25000">25,000</num></measure>) paid for the site. 
<P>The length of the Viaduct from Newgate Street to Holborn is about <num value="1400">1,400</num> feet, and the width between the building-line <num value="80">80</num> feet, affording space for a <num value="50">50</num>-feet carriage-way in the centre, and <num value="2">two</num> pavements, each <num value="15">15</num> feet wide, at either side.   The <pb id="P.502" n="502"> surface of the carriage-way is paved with cubes of granite <num value="9">9</num> inches by <num value="3">3</num> inches, and the side pavements are laid with York flags, with perforated gratings to light the subways. 
<P>During the demolition of the old streets and houses, for the purpose of clearing the ground for the Viaduct, nothing of any special value or interest was brought to light. The most noteworthy incidents, says a writer in the <title>Builder</title>, of <datestruct VALUE="1869-04-24"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=24>24th</day>, <year reg=1869>1869</year></datestruct>, were <QUOTE>the frequent discovery of all sorts of concealed passages for escape, and nooks for hiding plunder in the villainous old houses of Field Lane and its unsavoury neighbourhood, the removal of which alone should cause the Holborn Valley Improvement to be considered a blessing to this part of London. In carrying the new road through St. Andrew's Churchyard, a large slice of the ground was required, and this compelled the removal of a great number of human remains; between <num value="11000">11,000</num> and <num value="12000">12,000</num> were therefore decorously transferred to the City Cemetery at Ilford.</QUOTE> 
<P>The opening of Holborn Viaduct by the Queen took place on the <datestruct VALUE="1869-11-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1869">1869</year></datestruct>, the same day as that on which Her Majesty opened the new bridge over the Thames at Blackfriars. The ceremony was an imposing <num value="1">one</num>, and excited uncommon interest and enthusiasm amongst all classes in the metropolis. The day fortunately was bright and fair, and, leaving out of account a momentary interruption of its sunshine, was as good as could have been looked for in November. Blackfriars Bridge having been opened, and a loyal address from the Corporation of London having previously been presented, the combined royal and civic processions passed up Farringdon Street amidst an immense assemblage of people, the roadway in the middle being kept clear by soldiers and policemen. The Queen's carriage stopped for a moment before the Viaduct Bridge, that Her Majesty might observe the structure from below.   She then passed under it, and turned up Charterhouse Street into Smithfield, which she traversed on the west side of the Meat Market. Her attention was particularly directed to the market-building, which was gorgeously decorated with flags and streamers. From West Smithfield the procession turned into Giltspur Street, and soon the neighbourhood re-echoed with the cheering of the Bluecoat boys, who, to the number of <num value="750">750</num>, were assembled in their playground, to give their sovereign a loyal welcome. Under St. Sepulchre's Church were ranged several hundreds of the boys and girls of the parish and charity schools; and what with their shrill acclamations, and those of the Bluecoat boys opposite, the effect is said to have been startling. 
<P> <QUOTE>Here was the east end of the Holborn Valley Viaduct, close to Newgate Prison and St. Sepulchre's Church. <num value="2">Two</num> colossal plaster statues, <num value="1">one</num> bearing the palm of Victory, the. other the olive-branch of Peace, were set up at the entrance, and numerous banners helped the general effect. Along the level approach to the Viaduct, which was from end to end strewn with yellow sand, seats were placed under cover, and in well-arranged blocks, for the guests of the Corporation. Above these streamed in the fresh breeze bannerets of the dagger and St. George's Cross on a white ground, from days immemorial the arms of the City of London; and the masts to which they were attached were painted and gilt. The pavilion, which had seats for <num value="600">600</num> spectators, was constructed of red and white striped canvas at the sides, but of goldcoloured hangings, with devices in colour at the end, and with curtains of maroon to keep out the draughts. The royal arms, in rich gilding, surmounted the main entrance, supported on each hand by the City arms above the side divisions. <num value="4">Four</num> female figures, bearing golden baskets of fruit, were placed against the gilt divisions of the pavilion; and between each couple of fruit-bearers was a large statue, chosen from the best works in the possession of the Crystal Palace Company.</QUOTE> In the centre of the pavilion the roadway was narrowed, so that the dais might be carried close to the royal carriage, and at this point were assembled as a deputation to receive Her Majesty, Mr. Deputy Fry, the chairman of the Improvement Committee, Alderman Carter, Sir Benjamin Phillips, and several members of the Common Council. 
<P>The visitors accommodated in the reserved places all rose as they heard the welcome of the boys and children at Christ's Hospital and St. Sepulchre's, and then took up the cheering. The procession slowly passed along the viaduct.   More than once it came to a stop as the carriage of the Lord Mayor or an alderman halted at the platform in the pavilion, and its occupants alighted.   When Her Majesty reached the platform and the carriage halted, the Lord Mayor presented Mr. Deputy Fry and Mr. Haywood, the engineer of the viaduct. Mr. Fry then handed to the Queen a volume elaborately bound in cream-coloured morocco, relieved with gold, and ornamented with the Royal arms of England, in mosaic of leather and gold; and Her Majesty declared the viaduct open for public traffic. The Lord Mayor and the other civic dignitaries then took leave of Her Majesty and returned to their carriages, and the procession again got under weigh.   But it broke up immediately on passing through the gates of the temporary barrier, and 
<FIGURE id="fig.502facing" n="2000.07.0180"><HEAD>The Holborn Viaduct</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="P.503" n="503"> the Lord Mayor and his company turned towards the City, whilst Her Majesty drove quickly up Holborn, and so by Oxford Street to Paddington Station, from whence she returned by special train to Windsor. 
<P>No sooner was this gigantic undertaking completed, and the viaduct open for traffic, than an alarm was raised-cracks had appeared in some of the great polished granite pillars which supported the bridge over Farringdon Street. A lively newspaper correspondence was the result, and many wise things were said on both sides; but the pillars have borne heavy traffic and all the changes of temperature since then without any perceptible extension of the flaw, and the safety of the work is no longer, if it ever was seriously, in doubt. 
<P>The present church of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.503.1">St. Andrew's, Holborn</LEMMA>, was erected by Wren, in <datestruct value="1686--"><year reg="1686">1686</year></datestruct>, on the site of the old church, in the Ward of Farringdon Without. Let us begin by speaking of the history of the old building.   The exact date of its foundation is uncertain, but in <datestruct value="1297--"><year reg="1297">1297</year></datestruct> we find it given by <num value="1">one</num> Gladerinus to the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's; it being stipulated at the same time that the church should be held of them by the Abbot and Convent of Bermondsey. The monasteries being dissolved in the reign of Henry VIII., the right of presentation devolved to the Crown, and the king made it over to Thomas Lord Wriothesley, afterwards Lord Chancellor and Earl of Southampton, who died <datestruct VALUE="1550-07-30"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=30>30th</day>, <year reg=1550>1550</year></datestruct>, and was buried in St. Andrew's. At a later date the right of presentation became vested in the Duke of Buccleugh.   The <num value="1">first</num> vicar mentioned by Newcourt goes under the name of Richard de Tadeclowe; he was appointed before the year <datestruct value="1322"><year reg="1322">1322</year></datestruct>, and among those who succeeded him in the old church were Thomas de Cottingham, in <datestruct value="1343--"><year reg="1343">1343</year></datestruct>, keeper of the Great Seal, and Gilbert Worthington, in <datestruct value="1443--"><year reg="1443">1443</year></datestruct>. 
<P>As to the appearance of the original building, we learn from the will of Gilbert Worthington, printed by Strype, that there were <num value="4">four</num> altars in it, if not more. The steeple was commenced in <datestruct value="1446--"><year reg="1446">1446</year></datestruct>, but from some cause or other it was not finished till <datestruct value="1468"><year reg="1468">1468</year></datestruct>.   During the interval the north and south aisles were rebuilt. At the general clearance of the Reformation St. Andrew's fared no better than its neighbours: in the <num value="1">first</num> year of Edward VI. many of the altars and statues were removed, and in that year and in the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth the numerous monumental brasses of this church were converted into current coin of the realm. 
<P>When the Great Fire ravaged the City, the church escaped; but being in a hopelessly ruinous condition it was taken down, with the exception of the tower, about <num value="10">ten</num> years after that event, and a new building was in course of time erected in accordance with designs furnished by the great architect, Sir Christopher Wren. 
<P>The interior of this new church consisted of a nave, <num value="2">two</num> aisles, and chancel; and has been praised by many writers for its magnificence and beauty. Mr. Godwin, however, remarks that <QUOTE>an alteration in taste, as regards architectural productions, has been produced. The value of simplicity and breadth of parts, in opposition to minute divisions and elaborate ornament, has been admitted; and therefore, although it may be regarded as a large and commodious church--a good specimen of the style in which it is built, and as a construction well executed--it will not again obtain the unconditional praise which was formerly bestowed upon it.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>Pillars,</QUOTE> adds Mr. Godwin, describing the church interior as it appeared when he wrote, in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>cased with wainscot, support a gallery on either side; and at the west end, and from the top of the gallery-front, rise diminutive Corinthian columns bearing small blocks intended to represent an entablature, reminding <num value="1">one</num> of the columns with the <num value="2">two</num> chapiters or capitals, called Jachin and Boaz, mentioned in the description of Solomon's Temple. A wagon-headed ceiling of large span, in panels, supported on these blocks, and adorned with festoons of flowers and fruit, covers the body of the church.   The ceiling of the aisles is groined, and opens into the wagon-headed ceiling, forming an arch between each of the columns. At the west end of the church there is a <num value="2">second</num> gallery, at a great height from the ground, which is appropriated to the children of the Sunday schools. On the wall behind it were formerly some large paintings, but these have been obliterated. 
<P>The chancel is somewhat richly adorned with paintings, gilding, and stained glass; and the walls are covered with wainscot, which is veined to imitate Sienna marble, as high as the ceiling. Above the carved altar-piece is a large Palladian window in <num value="2">two</num> storeys, containing in stained glass a representation of the Last Supper, and of the Ascension, executed by Price of York, in <datestruct value="1718--"><year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct>. The colours are for the most part brilliant; but as a work of art, the window is not deserving of commendation. On either side of it are <num value="2">two</num> large paintings (apparently in fresco) of St. Andrew and St. Peter, and <num value="2">two</num> smaller panels representing the Holy Family and the infant St. John.   In the ceiling of the chancel is introduced a glazed light, whereon is painted the dove.   There are <num value="2">two</num> other windows at the east end of the church which <pb id="P.504" n="504"> are filled with stained glass, namely, <num value="1">one</num> in the north aisle containing the royal arms, and those of the donor, inscribed: <QUOTE lang=la><datestruct value="1687--"><year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct>.   Ex dono Thomae Hodgson de Bramwill in Agro Eboracen. Militis;</QUOTE>
 and another, at the end of the south aisle, representing the arms of John Thavie, Esq., who, in the year <datestruct value="1348"><year reg="1348">1348</year></datestruct>, left a considerable estate towards the support of this fabric for ever.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Towards the close of <datestruct value="1872--"><year reg="1872">1872</year></datestruct>, St. Andrew's underwent a most thorough overhauling, and was reopened for public worship on Sunday, the <datestruct value="10-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct> of that year. The ancient tower, which used to be separated from the nave of the church by a screen-wall, with a gallery in front, was thrown open to the nave by the removal of the wall and gallery. 
<P>A ritual chancel was formed at the east end, the floor-level of which was raised <num value="2">two</num> feet above the floor-line of the nave, and choir-stalls were arranged north and south of the same. The old high-backed square pewing was removed, and in its place new low oak seating was substituted. The old windows were done away with, and new iron ones took their place, glazed with tinted cathedral glass. 
<FIGURE id="Fig.504" n="2000.07.0181"><HEAD>The West End Of St. Andrew's, Showing The Gothic Arch.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
<P>In addition to these alterations, the church was re-decorated. The nave ceiling and groined ceilings of the galleries were painted in panels of a tempered turquoise blue as a ground-colour, with margins in stone and vellum, the enrichments being in white. The blue grounds were filled with a classic diaper, in self-colouring and white, the walls being a neutral of silver grey. The shafts of columns were finished in Indian red. The chancel ceiling was treated in the same manner as that of the nave, with this exception, that the enrichments to the panels were gilded. 
<P>A new organ was also constructed. It spans over the Gothic arch, and rests upon the galleries on either side. 
<P>The church contains a carved oak pulpit, and a sculptured marble font, displaying <num value="4">four</num> cherubim. The whole length of the building is stated as <num value="105">105</num> feet, the breadth <num value="63">63</num> feet, and the height <num value="43">43</num> feet. 
<P>The old organ of St. Andrew's, made by Harris, was celebrated as being part of the discarded instrument in the contest for superiority between Father Schmydt and Harris, at the Temple Church. This contest has been described by us at page <num value="145">145</num> <pb id="P.505" n="505"> Vol. I. When Dr. Sacheverell entered upon the living of St. Andrew's, he found that the organ, not having been paid for, had, from its erection in <datestruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct>, been shut up; he therefore had a collection made among his parishioners, raised the amount, and paid for the instrument. 
<P>There.are no remarkable features to be pointed out in connection with the exterior of the church. It is divided into <num value="2">two</num> storeys, and terminates with a cornice and balustrade. <QUOTE>The old Gothic tower,</QUOTE> says Mr. Godwin, <QUOTE>notwithstanding it was re-cased and adorned with vanes and pine-apples at the <num value="4">four</num> corners, is still to be detected by the large buttresses left standing at the angles, and the small pointed windows remaining in the lower storey.

<P>St. Andrews, says Mr. Godwin, is <num value="1">one</num> of the best-placed churches in London, <QUOTE>for as the west end is nearly at the summit of Holborn Hill, the foundation was necessarily continued throughout on this level, to the cast end in Shoe Lane; so

When he arrived, however, to take her into custody, the king had made friends again with his <num value="6">sixth</num> and last wife, and the chancellor was dismissed, his Majesty calling him knave, an arrant knave, a fool, a beast, and suchlike complimentary names.   It was the influence of Wriothesley which chiefly led to the execution of the Earl of Surrey, and the attainder of the Duke of Norfolk, in <datestruct value="1547--"><year reg="1547">1547</year></datestruct>.   He was <num value="1">one</num> of the executors of Henry VIII., and an opponent of the Protector Somerset. 
<P>Another of those buried in this church was Henry Sacheverell, who died in <datestruct value="1724--"><year reg="1724">1724</year></datestruct>.   He was laid in the chancel, where there is an inscription on the pavement to his memory. It may well be left to another occasion to tell the story of this divine, and of the <num value="2">two</num> famous sermons which he preached at Derby and at St. Paul's, with the object of exciting alarm for the safety of the Church, and creating hostility against the Dissenters. Being impeached in the House of Commons, in the year <datestruct value="1710"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct>, he was sentenced to be suspended from preaching for <num value="3">three</num> years. But this prosecution established the popularity of the preacher; and the very month that his suspension terminated, he was appointed to the valuable rectory of St. Andrew's, Holborn. Like many who owe their popularity to circumstances, rather than to any merit of their own, Sacheverell dropped, in Holborn, into comparative obscurity, and nothing worthy of note is told of him, but that his quarrels with his parishioners were by no means unfrequent-just as <num value="1">one</num> might have expected from so pugnacious a character. He had the good luck, during his latter days, to inherit a considerable fortune. 
<P>There is much of interest connected with the registers of St. Andrew's. Some of the books are dated as far back as <datestruct value="1558--"><year reg="1558">1558</year></datestruct>, the <num value="1">first</num> year of Queen Elizabeth's reign. <num value="1">One</num> of the volumes, containing entries from <datestruct value="1653--"><year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>, is wholly occupied with proclamations of marriage during the interregnum, when they were published in the market-place.

<P>The extract quoted above from the register is an illustration of a curious chapter in the history of marriage customs and laws in England. By a statute of <datestruct VALUE="1653-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>, the betrothed couple were allowed to choose whether they would be <QUOTE>asked</QUOTE> in church or chapel on <num value="3">three</num> several Sundays, or cried in the open market on <num value="3">three</num> consecutive market-days, at the town nearest their ordinary place of worship. This was the assertion with a vengeance of the civil nature of the marriage contract.   If the lovers chose the latter method, their proposed union was in most cases proclaimed by the bellman, though the kind offices of that official were not legally required for making the announcement. <QUOTE>In the absence of conclusive evidence on the matter,</QUOTE> says Mr. J. C. Jeaffreson, the historian of <title>Brides and Bridals,</title> <QUOTE>I have no doubt that the street banns of our forefathers, in Cromwell's England, were rarely proclaimed by, clergymen. On the other hand it is certain that the bellman was, in many places, regularly employed to cry aloud for impediments to the wedding of precise lovers.</QUOTE> 
<P>The parish register contains <num value="2">two</num> interesting entries of marriage, the <num value="1">first</num> of which is that of Edward Coke, <QUOTE>the Queen's Attorney-General,</QUOTE> <pb id="P.507" n="507"> and <QUOTE>my Lady Elizabeth Hatton,</QUOTE> in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>. This lady was the relict of Sir William Hatton, and the daughter of the celebrated Thomas Lord Burleigh, afterwards Earl of Exeter.   She became Coke's <num value="2">second</num> wife, his <num value="1">first</num> having been a lady of the ancient and highly-connected family of the Pastons, by whom he had the large sum for those days of <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure>.   By the widow of Sir William he also obtained a considerable addition to his property; but his marriage with her is but another example to be added to the list of the unfortunate matrimonial alliances of distinguished men. The celebration of the ceremony involved both parties in some difficulty. There had been, the same year, a great deal of notice taken of irregular marriages, and Archbishop Whitgift had intimated to the bishops of his province that all who offended in point of time, place, or form were to be prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law. Coke, however, seems to have presumed on his own and the lady's position, or on his acquaintance, if not friendship, with the prelate, and he disregarded the statute, and was married in a private house, without even having had the banns published or a licence obtained. But this act of contumacy was not passed over. Coke, the newly-married lady, the minister who officiated, Lord Burleigh, and several other persons, were prosecuted in the ecclesiastical court; but upon their submission by their proxies, the whole affair ended in smoke; they were absolved from excommunication, and the penalties consequent upon it, because, says the record, they had offended not out of contumacy, but through ignorance of the law in that point. It strikes <num value="1">one</num>, at this distance of time, that the suit may have been commenced merely for the sake of public example. 
<P>Lady Elizabeth Hatton proved a Tartar. When, many years afterwards, <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.507.1">Sir Edward Coke</LEMMA> proposed a marriage between his younger daughter by Lady Hatton and Sir John Villiers, she raised a tempest, and resenting her husband's attempt to dispose of the daughter without asking her consent, carried the young lady off, and lodged her at Sir Edmund Withipole's, near Oatlands.   Sir Edward complained to the Privy Council, and then went with his sons to Oatlands and captured his daughter, a proceeding which induced Lady Hatton to complain to the Privy Council in her turn. Much confusion followed, but at last the marriage of the young couple actually did take place. Then the ill--will between the old people broke out again, and many letters are still in existence, showing a great deal of heat and resentment in both parties. At <num value="1">one</num> time Sir Edward publicly accused his wife of having purloined his plate, and substituted counterfeited 
<hi rend=italics>alkumy</hi> in its place, with intent to defraud him; but she had quite as good to say about him. In about <num value="4">four</num> years their reconciliation seems to have been effected, and that by no less a mediator than James I., but they never enjoyed anything like domestic happiness. 
<P>The other entry of marriage is that of Colonel Hutchinson and Lucy Apsley, in <datestruct value="1638--"><year reg="1638">1638</year></datestruct>. And here, by way of contrast to the last, we have <num value="1">one</num> of the most touching instances of womanly affection that ever was set down in writing.   Mrs. Hutchinson is best known by her <title>Memoirs</title> of the life of her husband, a charming volume of biography. The account given by her of the courtship which led up to the ceremony before the altar of St. Andrew's is a narrative which all should read, and which all will enjoy. 
<P>Mr. Hutchinson fell in love with the lady before seeing her. He had been invited to go to Richmond by his music-master, a man who stood high in his profession, and had been warned by a friend to take heed of the place, for it was so fatal to love, that never any young disengaged person went thither who returned again free. He determined, however, to run the risk, and went. The musician's house was a lively <num value="1">one</num>, frequented by much good company, including gentlemen and ladies connected with the court, and many of the king's musicians. 
<P>There happened to be   boarded there, for the practice of the lute, and till the return of her mother, a younger daughter of Sir Allen Apsley, late Lieutenant of the Tower. The mother had gone into Wiltshire to complete a treaty, in which some progress had been made, about the marriage of her elder daughter. <QUOTE>This young girl;</QUOTE> says Mrs. Hutchinson, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>that was left in the house with Mr. Hutchinson, was a very child, her elder sister being at that time scarcely past it, but a child of such pleasantness and vivacity of spirit, and ingenuity in the quality she practised, that Mr. Hutchinson took pleasure in hearing her practise, and would fall in a discourse with her. She having the keys of her mother's house, some half a mile distant, would sometimes ask Mr. Hutchinson, when she went over, to walk along with her. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> day, when he was there, looking upon an odd by-shelf in her sister's closet, he found a few Latin books. Asking whose they were, he was told they were her elder sister's, whereupon, inquiring more after her, he began <num value="1">first</num> to be sorry she was gone before he had seen her, and gone upon such an account that he was not likely to see her. Then he grew to love to hear mention of her, and the other gentlewomen who had been her companions <pb id="P.508" n="508"> used to talk much to him of her, telling him how reserved and studious she was, and other things which they esteemed no advantage; but it so much inflamed Mr. Hutchinson's desire of seeing her, that he began to wonder at himself that his heart, which had ever had such an indifferency for the most excellent of womenkind, should have so strong impulses towards a stranger he never saw; and certainly it was of the Lord (though he perceived it not), who had ordained him, through so many providences, to be yoked with her in whom he found so much satisfaction.</QUOTE> Her praises continued to be daily sounded in his ears; but at last news arrived which led all the company present <num value="1">one</num> day at table to concluded that Miss Lucy- or <QUOTE>Mrs.</QUOTE> Lucy, as young ladies used to be called then--was really married. Mr. Hutchinson immediately turned pale as ashes, and had to retire from table to conceal his agitation. 
<P>But it proved a false alarm, and some little time after she made her appearance, and the lover, who had fallen in love with a shadow, met the reality. <QUOTE>His heart, being prepossessed with his own fancy, was not free to discern how little there was in her to answer so great an expectation.   She was not ugly; in a careless riding habit; she had a melancholy negligence both of herself and others, as if she neither affected to please others, nor took notice of anything before her; yet in spite of all her indifferency, she was surprised with some unusual liking in her soul when she saw this gentleman, who had hair, eyes, shape, and countenance enough to beget love in any <num value="1">one</num> at the <num value="1">first</num>, and these set off with a graceful and generous mien, which promised an extraordinary person; he was at that time, and indeed always, very neatly habited, for he wore good and rich clothes, and had variety of them, and had them well suited, and every way answerable; in that little thing showing both good judgment and great generosity, he equally becoming them and they him, which he wore with such unaffectedness and such neatness, as do not often meet in <num value="1">one</num>.   Although he had but an evening sight of her he had so long desired, and that at disadvantage enough for her, yet the prevailing sympathy of his soul made him think all his pains well paid; and this <num value="1">first</num> did whet his desire to a <num value="2">second</num> sight, which he had by accident the next day, and, to his joy, found she was wholly disengaged from that treaty which he so much feared had been accomplished; he found withal, that though she was modest, she was accostable,. and willing to entertain his acquaintance.   This soon passed into a mutual friendship between them, and though she innocently thought nothing of love, yet was she glad to have acquired such a friend, who had wisdom and virtue enough to be trusted with her councils, for she was then much perplexed in mind.   Her mother and friends had a great desire she should marry, and were displeased that she refused many offers which they thought advantageous enough; she was obedient, loath to displease them, but more herself, in marrying such as she could find no inclination to.</QUOTE> 
<P>It was not long before friendship on her part passed into love; but of their mutual affection in its full height Mrs. Hutchinson limits herself to saying this, <QUOTE>There never was a passion more ardent and less idolatrous; he loved her better than his life, with inexpressible tenderness and kindness; had a most high obliging esteem   of her, yet still considered honour, religion, and duty above her, nor ever suffered the intrusion of such a dotage as should blind him from marking her imperfections; these he looked upon with such an indulgent eye as did not abate his love and esteem of her, while it augmented his care to blot out all those spots which might make her appear less worthy of that respect he paid her; and thus, indeed, he soon made her more equal to him than he found her; for she was a very faithful mirror, reflecting truly, though but dimly, his own glories upon him, so long as he was present.   But she, that was nothing before his inspection gave her a fair figure, when he was removed, was only filled with a dark mist, and never could again take in any delightful object, nor return any shining representation.   The greatest excellency she had was the power of apprehending, and the virtue of loving his; so, as his shadow, she waited on him everywhere, till he was taken into that region of light that admits of none, and then she vanished into nothing.</QUOTE> 
<P>Unfortunately, the very   day the friends on both sides met to conclude the marriage, she fell ill of the small-pox. <QUOTE><num value="1">First</num> her life was almost in desperate hazard, and then the disease, for the present, made her the most deformed person that could be seen for a great while after she recovered.   Yet Mr. Hutchinson   was nothing troubled at it, but married her as soon as she was able to quit the chamber, when the priest and all that saw her were affrighted to look on her; but God recompensed his justice and constancy by restoring her, though she was longer than ordinary before she recovered, as well as before   .... On the <datestruct VALUE="1638-07-3"><day reg="3">third</day> day of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1638">1638</year></datestruct>, he was married to Mrs. Lucy Apsley, the <num value="2">second</num> daughter of Sir Allan Apsley, late lieutenant of the Tower of London, at St. Andrew's Church, in Holborn.</QUOTE> The <pb id="P.509" n="509"> newlymarried couple lived for some time afterwards in this neighbourhood. 
<P>Their subsequent career need only be glanced at. In <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct> Mr. Hutchinson became a lieutenantcolonel in the parliamentary army, and in <datestruct value="1643--"><year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct> was appointed governor of Nottingham   Castle. He took an active part in the struggles of the civil war, and in the government of the days of the Commonwealth, and proved himself a true patriot, honest and earnest in his endeavours to serve the best interests of his country.   He was an uncompromising republican, brave, high-minded, and unaffectedly pious.   At the Restoration he was discharged from Parliament, and from all offices of state for ever. In <datestruct VALUE="1663-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct>, he was arrested, imprisoned at Newark, thence carried to the Tower, and in the next year removed to Sandown Castle, where he fell ill and died on the <datestruct VALUE="1664-09-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1664">1664</year></datestruct>.   His noble wife was refused permission toshare his confinement. 
<P>Richard Savage, the poet, son of the unnatural Countess of Macclesfield, was, according to Dr. Johnson, christened in this church by the direction of Lord Rivers, his reputed father; in <datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>--<num value="8">8</num>. 
<P>In the register of burials of St. Andrew's   parish, under the date <datestruct VALUE="1770-08-28"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1770>1770</year></datestruct>, appears the following entry:-- <QUOTE>William Chatterton, Brooks Street;</QUOTE> to which has been added, probably by an after incumbent, <QUOTE>the poet,</QUOTE> signed <QUOTE>J. Mill.</QUOTE> The addition, is perfectly correct, although the poet's Christian name, was Thomas, not William, and this slight memorial is the only record in the church of the end of a short chapter in the <hi rend=italics>annals</hi> of genius.   We shall have more to say on the subject of this unfortunate bard, as well as on the equally melancholy career of Richard Savage, when we come shortly to speak of Brooke Street, Holborn, and its neighbourhood. 
<P>In the churchyard of St. Andrew's, Holborn, lie the remains of another poet, Henry Neele, author, among other works, of the <title>Romance of English History.</title> He was born in the Strand, on the <datestruct VALUE="1798-01-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, and early in life was apprenticed to a solicitor. During his clerkship-namely, in <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>-he made his <num value="1">first</num> appearance as an author before the public, and from that time continued to publish occasionally, until <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, on the <datestruct value="02-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct> of which year, in a fit of insanity, incipient, it is true, but encouraged by excessive reading, he unhappily destroyed himself. Against the west wall of the churchyard is a gravestone commemorative of his father, and bearing   an epitaph written by Henry Neele. On the same stone, together with the names of several others of the family, is the record of the poet's own premature death. The epitaph written by him   is as follows:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Good night, good night, sweet spirit! Thou hast cast 
<L>Thy bonds of clay away from thee at last; 
<L>Broke the vile earthly fetters, which alone 
<L>Held thee at distance from thy Maker's throne. 
<L>But, oh! those fetters to th&lsquo; immortal mind 
<L>Were links of love to those thou'st left behind. 
<L>For thee we mourn not; as the apostle prest 
<L>His dungeon pillow, till the angel guest 
<L>Drew nigh; and when the light that round him shone 
<L>Beamed on the pris'ner, his bands were gone: 
<L>So wert thou captive to disease and pain, 
<L>Till death, the brightest of th&lsquo; angelic train, 
<L>Poured heaven's own radiance, by divine decree, 
<L>Around thy suffering soul, and it was free.</QUOTE>
 
<P>St. Andrew's has been called <QUOTE>the poet's church,</QUOTE> from the sons of song who have in some way or other been connected with it.   We have named <num value="3">three</num> already, and have here to speak of a <num value="4">fourth</num>. John Webster, the dramatist, is said to have been parish clerk in St. Andrew's, but there is, unfortunately, no confirmation of this in the register. The clerkship, however, being in the gift of the rector, the vestry register could afford no direct evidence on the subject.   Webster has, to us, an obscure personal history, but by those who love an old play he will ever be remembered as the author of the 
<title>White Devil</title> and the <title>Duchess of Malfy</title>-<num value="2">two</num> performances, says Hazlitt, which upon the whole, perhaps, come the nearest to Shakespeare of anything we have on record.   Charles Lamb had a great admiration of our parish clerk's <title>White Devil</title>. <QUOTE>I never saw anything,</QUOTE> he writes, <QUOTE>like the funeral dirge in this play for the death of Marcello, except the ditty which reminds Ferdinand of his drowned father in the <title>Tempest</title>.   As that is of the water, watery, so this is of the earth, earthy. Both have that intensity of feeling which seems to resolve itself into the element which it contemplates.</QUOTE> Let us, while we have the chance, repeat, in honour to the memory of Webster, the exquisite lines alluded to by Lamb:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Call for the robin redbreast, and the wren, 
<L>Since o&lsquo;er shady groves they hover, 
<L>And with leaves and flowers do cover 
<L>The friendless bodies of unburied men. 
<L>Call unto his funeral dole 
<L>The ant, the fieldmouse, and the mole, 
<L>To rear him hillocks that shall keep him warm, 
<L>And (when gay tombs are robbed) sustain no harm 
<L>But keep the wolf far thence, that's foe to men, 
<L>For with his nails he'll dig them up again.</QUOTE>
 
<P>The <title>Duchess of Malfy</title>, Webster's <num value="2">second</num> great play, <QUOTE>is not,</QUOTE> remarks the critical Hazlitt, <QUOTE>in my judgment, quite so spirited or effectual a performance as the <title>White Devil</title>. But it is distinguished by the same kind of beauties, clad in the same terrors. <pb id="P.510" n="510"> I do not know but the occasional gleams of passion are even profounder and more Shakesperian; but the story is more laboured, and the horror is accumulated to an overwhelming and insupportable height.</QUOTE> 
<P>In the church register there is also entered the burial of Nathaniel Tomkins, executed for his share in Waller's plot.   Tomkins was Waller's brother-in-law. The plot for which he suffered is <num value="1">one</num> of the noted conspiracies of history. Waller, the poet, in conjunction with Tomkins, Challoner, Blinkhorne, and a few others, had undertaken to seize the persons of the leading members of the House of Commons, and to deliver up the City of London to Charles, who had sent in a commission of array very secretly, by means of the Lady Aubigny, whose husband had fallen at Edgehill. <QUOTE>A servant of Tomkins overheard the conversation of the conspirators, and revealed what he knew to Pym, who presently seized their chief and brought him to trial, where he confessed everything with amazing alacrity, and crawled in the dust, in the hope of saving his life.   The jury of Guildhall found a verdict of guilty against all the prisoners.

 Tomkins and Challoner were hanged, the <num value="1">one</num> in Holborn, and the other in Cornhill, both within sight of their own dwelling-houses; Blinkhorn, Hassell, White, and Waller were, by the mercy of Parliament and the Lord-General Essex, reprieved, and eventually saved. Waller, the chief of them, was detained in the Tower, but, about a year after, upon payment of <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>, was pardoned  <Q>and released to go travel abroad.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P>Another burial we must notice is that, in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, of Joseph Strutt, the author of <title>Sports and Pastimes of the People of England,</title> and several other works of an antiquarian character. Strutt was born at Springfield, in Essex, on the <datestruct VALUE="1749-10-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>, and was educated as an artist.   In <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct> he became a student at the Royal Academy, and was successful in winning both the gold and silver medals there. He served an apprenticeship to the unfortunate Ryland, and when his term   expired, began to unite literary labours of an antiquarian character with those of his artistic profession.   In <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct> he published his <num value="1">first</num> book, <title>The Regal and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of England,</title> and subsequently a <title>Complete View of the Manners and Customs, Arms, Habits, &amp;c., of the Inhabitants of England;</title>

He died on the <datestruct VALUE="1802-10-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, in Charles Street, Hatton Garden. His biographer sums up his character in these words:-- <QUOTE>The calamities   incident to man were indeed his portion on this earth, and these greatly augmented by unkindnesses where he least deserved to have met with them.   He was charitable without ostentation; a   sincere friend, without intentional guile; a dutiful son;   a faithful and affectionate husband; a good father; a worthy man; and, above all, it is humbly hoped, a sincere Christian. His natural talents were great, but little cultivated by early education. The numerous works which he gave to the world as an author and as an artist, prove that he employed his time to the best advantage.</QUOTE> 
<P>That celebrated preacher, William Whiston, once made himself rather troublesome in connection with this church.   He constantly attended and partook of the communion.   On his principles becoming known he was warned by Sacheverell to forbear partaking of the sacrament. <QUOTE>Wicked Will</QUOTE> Whiston, however, persisted, and at last the rector fairly turned him out. Whiston aired his grievances in print, and then shifted his camp into another parish.   Pennant says that on the occasion of his ejection from the church, he had taken it into his head to disturb Dr. Sacheverell while he was in the pulpit, giving utterance to some doctrine contrary to the opinion of that heterodox divine.   His lawyer, who had no liking for Dr. Sacheverell, tried to induce Whiston to prosecute the doctor for the insult, and offered to take the business in hand without fees; but this Whiston refused, replying, <QUOTE>If I should give my consent, I should show myself to be as foolish and passionate as Sacheverell himself.</QUOTE> 
<P>Whiston was born in <datestruct value="1667--"><year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>, and died in <datestruct value="1752--"><year reg="1752">1752</year></datestruct>. During his life he head many ups and downs, and seems to have been long tossed to and fro on a sea of religious doubt and metaphysical uncertaint.       Towards the close of his career he distinguished himself by an abortive attempt to discover the longitude,   and by his opinions on the Millennium and the restoration of the Jews.   He was a favourite with Queen Caroline, who presented him with <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> every year from the time she became queen, which pension was continued for some time after her death.   We get a glimpse of the queen and the eccentric divine in the following anecdote told by Whiston's son.   The queen, who liked Whiston's free conversation, once asked him what people in general said of her.   He replied that they justly esteemed her as a lady of great abilities, a patron of learned men, and a kind friend to the poor. <QUOTE>But,</QUOTE> says she, <QUOTE>no <num value="1">one</num> is without faults, pray what are mine?</QUOTE> Mr. Whiston begged to be excused speaking on that subject, but she insisting, he said her majesty did not behave with proper reverence at church.   She replied, the king would persist in talking with her. He said, a greater than kings was there only to be regarded. She acknowledged the truth of this, and confessed her fault. <QUOTE>Pray,</QUOTE> said she, <QUOTE>tell me what is my next?</QUOTE> He answered, <QUOTE>When your majesty has amended of that fault I will tell you of your next;</QUOTE> and so it ended. 
<P>But we must not be carried away, by recollection of such tales, to forget St. Andrew's.   Hacket, who afterwards became a bishop, was rector here for several years. This divine was born near Exeter House in the Strand, on the <datestruct VALUE="1592-09-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1592">1592</year></datestruct>, and was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge.   He took orders in the year <datestruct value="1618"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct>, and we find him passing through various stages of advancement till in <datestruct value="1623--"><year reg="1623">1623</year></datestruct> he landed in the post of chaplain to James I., with whom he became a favourite preacher.   In <datestruct value="1624--"><year reg="1624">1624</year></datestruct>, upon the recommendation of the Lord Keeper, Dr. Williams, he was made rector of St. Andrew's, Holborn. His patron also procured him, in the course of the same year, the rectory of Cheam, in Surrey, telling him that he intended Holborn for wealth and Cheam for health. 
<P>During the time of the Civil War he was in danger, through his allegiance to the unpopular party, of getting into trouble. <QUOTE><num value="1">One</num> Sunday,</QUOTE> says Cunningham, <QUOTE>whilst he was reading the Common Prayer in St. Andrew's, a soldier of the Earl of Essex came, clapped a pistol to his breast, and commanded him to read no farther.   Not at all terrified, Hacket said he would do what became a divine, and he might do what became a soldier. He was permitted to proceed.</QUOTE> 
<P>At the Restoration he was made Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, and set a noble example by exhibiting a degree of munificence worthy of his station. He expended <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure> in repairing his cathedral, and was, besides, a liberal benefactor to the college of which he had been a member. He was the author of the Life of Archbishop Williams, a quaint and learned work, half made up of quotations, like Burton's <title>Anatomy of Melancholy.</title>
 
<P>As for his character, he is described as having <pb id="P.513" n="513"> been exemplary in behaviour, cheerful in conversation, hospitable, humble and affable, though subject to great eruptions of anger, but at the same time very placable and ready to be appeased, and altogether of too generous a nature to be really. vindictive. 
<P>The Dissenters once got an agreeable surprise whilst Hacket was rector of St. Andrew's.   Soon after the Restoration, having received notice of the interment of a Dissenter belonging to his parish, he got the burial service by heart.   He was a fine elocutionist, and besides felt deeply the propriety and excellence of what he had to deliver; so he went through the service with such emphasis and grace as touched the hearts of all who were present, and particularly of the friends of the deceased, who unanimously gave it as their opinion that they had never heard a finer discourse. Their astonishment may be conceived when they learned that it was taken word for word from the Liturgy, a book which, though they had never read it, they affected to hold   in contempt and detestation. Other clergymen, it is said, have been known to practise the same pious fraud as Mr. Hacket, and with a like success. 
<P>During Mr. Hacket's time St. Andrew's was old and decayed. He took in hand to rebuild it, and for that purpose got together a great sum of money, but on the breaking out of the Civil War the funds were seized by Parliament, as well as those which had been gathered for the repair of St. Paul's Cathedral, so that he was unable to carry out his praiseworthy intentions. 
<P>Another eminent rector of St. Andrew's was Stillingfleet, who was afterwards raised to the see of Worcester. Stillingfleet was truly a controversial divine, his life being <num value="1">one</num> long warfare with Romanists, Nonconformists, Socinians, and the philosopher, John Locke. Among his Nonconformist opponents were Owen, Baxter, and Howe. He was born in <datestruct value="1635--"><year reg="1635">1635</year></datestruct>, and died in <datestruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct>. He was presented to the living of St. Andrew's, Holborn, in <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, by Thomas, Earl of Southampton.   His biographer describes his person as tall, graceful, and well-proportioned; his countenance as comely, fresh; and awful. <QUOTE>His apprehension was quick and sagacious; his judgment exact and profound; and his memory very tenacious; so that considering how intensely he studied, and how he read everything, it is easy to imagine him what he really was, <num value="1">one</num> of the most universal scholars that ever lived.</QUOTE> 
<P>Stillingfleet was at <num value="1">one</num> time chaplain to King Charles II., and in that capacity exhibited considerable ability as a courtier. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion it is told that his majesty asked him <QUOTE>how it came about that he always read his sermons before him, when he was informed he invariably preached without book elsewhere?</QUOTE> He told the king that <QUOTE>the awe of so noble an audience, where he saw nothing that was not greatly superior to him, but chiefly the seeing before him so great, and wise a prince, made him afraid to trust himself.</QUOTE> With this answer, which was not very becoming in a divine, the king was well content. <QUOTE>But pray,</QUOTE> said Stillingfleet, <QUOTE>will your majesty, give me leave to ask you a question, too?   Why do you read your speeches, when you have none of the same reasons?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Why, truly, doctor,</QUOTE> said the king, <QUOTE>your question is a very pertinent <num value="1">one</num>, and so will be my answer. I have asked them so often, and for so much money, that I am ashamed to look them in, the face.</QUOTE> 
<P>Amongst the rectors of St. Andrew's was the Rev. Charles Barton, who died in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, and of whom an anecdote worth repeating is given by the historian of the churches of London.   He had acted diligently as curate of the church for several years, when the previous rector died, and presuming on length of service, he waited on the Duchess-Dowager of Buccleugh to ask for the living. <QUOTE>You have come soon, and yet too late,</QUOTE> said her Grace; <QUOTE>for having made up my mind a dozen years ago as to whom I would give St. Andrew's, I have sent my servant with the presentation.</QUOTE> Mr. Barton bowed in silence, and returned home, where he found his wife and family rejoicing over, the duchess's letter. <QUOTE>Ah,</QUOTE> said he, <QUOTE>her Grace loves a joke,</QUOTE> and of course went back immediately to thank her.   When he died the duchess continued her kindness to the family, and presented at living to his eldest son, who was also in the Church. Mr. Charles Barton was buried in St. Andrew's, and was commemorated by a tablet in the north gallery. 
<P>Under an Act of Parliament passed in the reign of Queen Anne, and. in consequence of the proceedings that took place in connection with it, the parish of St. George the Martyr, Queen Square, which before had formed part of St. Andrew's, Holborn, was erected into a distinct parish for spiritual purposes, although still united with St. Andrew's as regards the poor, and other secular matters. 
<P>Newcourt informs us that a public grammar-school was among the adjuncts of the church. It was <num value="1">one</num> of those erected by Act of Parliament in the reign of Henry VI., and, according to Maitland, stood on the right side of the church, and was taken down in <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>. <pb id="P.514" n="514">

<P>A little north of St. Andrew's, Holborn, and running parallel to Hatton Garden, stand <num value="2">two</num> rows of houses known as Ely Place. To the public it is <num value="1">one</num> of those unsatisfactory. streets which lead nowhere; to the inhabitants it is quiet and pleasant; to the student of Old London it is possessed of all the charms which can be given by <num value="5">five</num> centuries of change and the long residence of the great and noble. The present Ely Place, and a knot of neighbouring tenements, streets, and alleys, occupy the site of the town house, or <QUOTE>hostell,</QUOTE> of the Bishops of Ely. And to the history of the old mansion, and its sometimes gay and sometimes sober inmates, we shall devote the following chapter. 
<P>The earliest notice of Ely Place belongs to the close of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century. John de Kirkeby, Bishop of Ely, died in the year <datestruct value="1290"><year reg="1290">1290</year></datestruct>, and left to his successors in the see a messuage and <num value="9">nine</num> cottages in Holborn. His intention was to found a London residence for the Bishops of Ely, suitable to their rank.   Previous to this time they had their London residence in the Temple, but things do not seem to have gone smoothly with them there. In <datestruct value="1250--"><year reg="1250">1250</year></datestruct> Bishop Balsham was denied entrance there by the master, when Hugh Bigod was Justiciary of England. He insisted, however, on the rights which his predecessors had enjoyed, from the Conquest, of using the hall, chapel, chambers, kitchen, pantry, buttery, and wine-cellar, with free ingress and egress, by land and water, whenever he came to London, and he laid his damages' at <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure>. The master not being able to overthrow the claim, the bishop won the case. But this was not an agreeable way of obtaining town lodgings, so no wonder John de Kirkeby was induced to bequeath the Holborn property for the benefit of his successors.   The next bishop, William de Luda, probably built the chapel of St. Etheldreda, and we find him adding a further grant to the bequest of John de Kirkeby, accompanied by the condition that <QUOTE>his next successor should pay <measure value="1000bmark" type=currency><num value="1000">one thousand</num> marks</measure> for the finding of <num value="3">three</num> chaplains</QUOTE> in the chapel there. The next benefactor to the episcopal residence was John de Hotham, another bishop, who added a vineyard, kitchen-garden, and orchard, and, altogether, seems to have given the finishing touch to the premises; so that Camden speaks of Ely Place as <QUOTE>well beseeming bishops to live in; for which they are beholden to John de Hotham, Bishop of Ely under King Edward III.</QUOTE> Other and subsequent prelates did their duty by building, altering, and repairing, and conspicuous amongst these was the well-known Arundel, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, who erected a large and handsome <QUOTE>gate-house or front,</QUOTE> towards Holborn, in the stone-work of which his arms remained in Stow's time. Thus Ely Place, by the liberality of many successive prelates, came to be <num value="1">one</num> of the most magnificent of metropolitan mansions. 
<P>In the reign of Elizabeth, Sir Christopher Hatton was the occupant of Ely Place; and we shall tell in a few words the interesting story of his coming in, and the bishop's going out. Meanwhile-pursuing our rapid notice of the history of the house-let us only say that Sir Christopher died, in Ely Place, in <datestruct value="1591--"><year reg="1591">1591</year></datestruct>, and was succeeded in his estates by his nephew, Newport, who took the name of Hatton. When he died, his widow, <QUOTE>the Lady Hatton,</QUOTE> who married Sir Edward Coke, the famous lawyer, held the property. The Bishops of Ely, upon her death, came in again, though in what appears a confused and unsatisfactory sort of way; and the subsequent history has been thus summarised by Mr. Peter Cunningham :-- <QUOTE>Laney, Bishop of Ely, died here in <datestruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct>-<num value="5">5</num>, and in Bishop Patrick's time (<datestruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>-<datestruct value="1707--"><year reg="1707">1707</year></datestruct>) a piece of ground was made over to the see for the erection of a new chapel, and the Hatton property saddled with a rent-charge of <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> per annum, payable to the see.   In this way matters stood till the death, in <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, of the last Lord Hatton, when the Hatton property in Holborn reverted to the Crown. An amicable arrangement was now effected, the see, in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, transferring to the Crown all its right to Ely Place, on an act (<num value="12">12</num>. Geo. III., c. <num value="43">43</num>) for building and making over to the Bishops of Ely a spacious house in Dover Street, Piccadilly, still in possession of the see, with an annuity of <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure> payable for ever.</QUOTE> 
<P>In Ralph Aggas's map of London, in the reign of <pb id="P.515" n="515"> Elizabeth, we see the vineyard, meadow, kitchengarden, and orchard of <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.515.1">Ely Place</LEMMA>, extending northward from Holborn to the present Hatton Wall and Vine Street, and east and west from Saffron Hill to nearly the present Leather Lane. Except a cluster of houses-Ely Rents-standing on Holborn Hill, the surrounding ground was about that time entirely open and unbuilt upon. In the names of Saffron Hill, Field Lane, Turnmill and Vine Streets, we get a glimpse of the rural past. In the Sutherland View (<datestruct value="1543--"><year reg="1543">1543</year></datestruct>) the gate-house, banqueting-hall, chapel, &amp;c., of this house are shown. 
<P>During the imprisonment of Bishop Wren by the Long Parliament, most of the palatial buildings were taken down, and upon the garden were built Hatton Garden, Great and Little Kirby Streets, Charles Street, Cross Street, and Hatton Wall. The present Ely Place was not built till about <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>. We find a fragment of the old episcopal residence preserved in, and giving its name to, Mitre Court, which leads from Ely Place to Hatton Garden. Here, worked into the wall of a tavern known as <QUOTE>The Mitre,</QUOTE> is a bishop's mitre, sculptured in stone, <QUOTE>which probably,</QUOTE> Mr. Timbs conjectures, <QUOTE>once adorned <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.515.2">Ely Palace</LEMMA>, or the precinct gateway.</QUOTE> 
<P>A writer in Knight's <title>London</title> has been at the pains to put together, from   existing material, a description of Ely Place as it existed immediately before the bishop's residence was levelled to the ground. <QUOTE>Let us imagine ourselves,</QUOTE> he says, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>entering the precincts from   Holborn. The original gate-house, where the bishop's armed retainers were wont to keep watch and ward in the old style, is now gone, and we enter from Holborn at once upon a small paved court, having on the right various offices, supported by a colonnade. and on the left a wall, dividing the court from the garden. 
<P>Passing from the court, we     reach the entrance to the great hall, which extends along in front, and to our left. This fine edifice, measuring about <num value="30">30</num> feet in height, <num value="32">32</num> in breadth, and <num value="72">72</num> in length, was originally built with stone, and the roof covered with lead. The interior, lighted by <num value="6">six</num> fine Gothic windows, was very interesting.   It had its ornamental timber roof, its tiled and probably originally chequered floor, its oaken screen at <num value="1">one</num> end, and its dais at the other; and when filled with some of the brilliant and picturesque-looking crowds that have met under its roof, must have presented a magnificent spectacle. 
<P>Beyond the hall, and touching it at the northwest corner, were the cloisters, enclosing a quadrangle nearly square, of great size, and having in the midst a small garden-made, perhaps, after the grant of the principal garden to Hatton. Over the cloisters were long, antique-looking galleries, with the doors and windows of various apartments appearing at the back;   in the latter, traces of painted glass--the remnants of former splendour-were still visible. Lastly, at the north-west corner of the cloisters, <hi rend=italics>in a field</hi> planted with trees and surrounded with a wall, stood the chapel-now   all that remains of what we have described, and of the still more numerous buildings that at <num value="1">one</num> time constituted the palace of the Bishops of Ely.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Having now got an idea of the appearance of Ely Place, and a notion of, at least, the skeleton of its history, we may proceed to add to our information, and to tell of the characters who have lived in it, and the incidents of which it has been the scene. 
<P>A famous   character in   English history- <QUOTE>Old John of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster</QUOTE> --resided here at the close of   his eventful life.   He died here in <datestruct value="1399--"><year reg="1399">1399</year></datestruct>. How   this came to be his residence is unknown: it is conjectured by Cunningham, and with some   show   of probability, that the bishops occasionally let the   house-or rather, perhaps, the greater part of it--to   distinguished   noblemen. Certainly John of Gaunt stood at this time in need of a town-house, for his palace of the Savoy had been burned to the ground by the insurgents during Wat Tyler's rebellion. Froissart thus speaks of his death:-- <QUOTE>So it fell that, about the feast of Christmas, Duke John of   Lancaster--who lived in great displeasure, what   because the   king   had banished his son out of the realm for so little cause, and also because of the evil governing of the realm by his nephew, King Richard--(for   he saw well, if long persevered, and were suffered to continue, the realm was likely to be utterly lost)-with these imaginations and others, the duke fell sick, whereon he died; whose death was greatly sorrowed by all his friends and   lovers.</QUOTE> 
<P>Shakespeare, in his play of <title>Richard II</title>., Act ii., sc. i, represents the dying nobleman in Ely House admonishing with his last breath his dissipated nephew, the king:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>A <num value="1000">thousand</num> flatterers sit within thy crown, 
<L>Whose compass is no bigger than thy head 
<L>And yet, incaged in so small a verge, 
<L>The waste is no whit lesser than thy land. 
<L>Oh, had thy grandsire, with a prophet's eye, 
<L>Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons, 
<L>From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame, 
<L>Deposing thee before thou wert possessed, 
<L>Which art possessed now to depose thyself. 
<L>Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world 
<L>It were a shame to let this land by lease: 
<L>But, for thy world, enjoying but this land, <pb id="P.516" n="516"> 
<L>Is it not more than shame to shame it so? 
<L>Landlord of England art thou, and not king.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Another nobleman who at <num value="1">one</num> time resided in Ely Place was Henry Radclyff, Earl of Sussex. We find him writing to his countess <QUOTE>from   Ely Place, in Holborn,</QUOTE> to tell her of. the death of Henry VIII.   And in Ely Place-then the residence of the Earl of Warwick (afterwards Duke of Northumberland--the council met and planned the remarkable conspiracy which resulted in the execution of the Protector Somerset. 
<P>The pleasant gardens which surrounded Ely House rejoiced in the growth of fine strawberries, and it is in connection with this fruit that the name of Ely Place has' been enshrined in the memory of all readers of Shakespeare. No <num value="1">one</num> needs to have recalled the scene in the Tower which ended in the execution of Hastings. Buckingham, Hastings, the Bishop of Ely, and others, are talking together 
<FIGURE id="Fig.516" n="2000.07.0185"><HEAD>William Whiston.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 of the coronation of the young King Edward V. The Duke of Gloucester, afterwards Richard III., enters, and after a few words exchanged with Buckingham, turns-possibly to conceal his deep and bloody design--to the bishop:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn, 
<L>I saw good strawberries in your garden there; 
<L>I do beseech you, send for some of them! 
<sp><speaker>Ely.</speaker><L>Marry, I will, my lord, with all my heart.</QUOTE>
 He goes out, and shortly returning, finds Gloucester gone. 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><sp><speaker>Ely.</speaker><L>Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester? I have sent for those strawberries. 
<sp><speaker>Hastings.</speaker><L>His grace looks cheerful and smooth this morning. 
<L>There's some conceit or other likes him well, 
<L>When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Ill-judging Hastings! Little did he guess that a   few   minutes after he would hear the Lord <pb id="P.517" n="517"> Protector thundering out, with reference to himself, <QUOTE>Thou'rt a traitor! Off with his head!</QUOTE> After the execution the cold-blooded Gloucester likely enough sat down with relish to a dessert of the bishop's strawberries. 
<P>How closely in this scene Shakespeare followed the historical truth we may see in this passage from Holinshed :--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>On the Friday (being the <datestruct VALUE="1483-06-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1483">1483</year></datestruct>) many lords were assembled in the Tower, and there sat in council, devising the honourable solemnity of the king:   (the young Edward V.'s) coronation, of which the time appointed then so near approached, that the pageants and subtleties were in making day and night at Westminster, and much victuals killed therefore, that afterwards was cast away.   These lords so sitting together, communing of this matter, the Protector (Gloucester) came in amongst them, just about <num value="9">nine</num> of the clock, saluting them courteously, and excusing himself that he had been from them so long, saying merrily that he had been a sleeper that day. After a little talking with them, he said unto the Bishop of Ely,  <Q>My lord, you have very good strawberries at your garden in Holborn; I require you let us have a mess of them.</Q>   <Q>Gladly, my lord,</Q>  quoth he.  <Q>Would God I had some better thing as ready to your pleasure as that</Q>  And therewithal, in all haste, he sent his servant for a mess of strawberries.</QUOTE> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.517" n="2000.07.0186"><HEAD>Ely House-The Hall.   (From Grose's <QUOTE>Antiquities,</QUOTE> <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
<P>In the time of Richard III., it may be added, strawberries were an article of ordinary consumption in London.   In Lydgate's poem of <title>London Lyckpeny</title> we learn as much:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Then unto London I did me hie, 
<L>Of all the land it beareth the prize; 
<L> <Q>Good peascod </Q>  <num value="1">one</num> began to cry- 
<L> <Q><hi rend=italics>Strawberry ripe</hi>! and cherries in the rise.</Q> </QUOTE>
 
<P>To make clear the connection existing between Lord Chancellor Hatton and Ely Place, to which we alluded at the beginning of this chapter, it will be necessary to give a short sketch of that worthy man who, says Malcolm, was <QUOTE>the cause of infinite loss and trouble to the Bishops of Ely for upwards of an <num value="100">hundred</num> years.</QUOTE> He was the youngest of <num value="3">three</num> sons of William Hatton, of Holdenby, a gentleman of good family. In early life he was entered at <num value="1">one</num> of the inns of court, where he studied law, but as a gentleman lawyer only, and not with the view of deriving any advantage from it as a profession.   Whilst engaged in this way he had the good fortune to attract the notice of Queen Elizabeth, and became in turn Gentleman Pensioner- <pb id="P.518" n="518"> Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, Captain of the Guard, Vice-Chamberlain, Member of the Privy Council, and Lord Chancellor. It seems he was possessed of many graces of person, and had great ability as a dancer. Elizabeth's fancy for him grew; to such a height, that Leicester did his best to make his rival ridiculous, by offering to introduce to the queen a dancing-master whose abilities far excelled those of Hatton. But his project was not successful. <QUOTE>No,</QUOTE> said Elizabeth, <QUOTE>I will not see your man; it is his trade.</QUOTE> She abandoned herself to her extravagant passion, and Hatton and she corresponded in the most fond and foolish style, of which there exists plenty of proof on the shelves of the State Paper Office. 
<P>But it can hardly be said that by dancing alone he skipped up to position and influence. He had many good mental qualities, and his advancement is <num value="1">one</num> of the numerous proofs the queen gave of her penetration in the choice of great State officers. On his becoming Lord Chancellor, the lawyers were unable to stifle their indignation. Some of the serjeants-at-law even refused to plead before him. But Hatton, though deficient in reading and practice as a lawyer, had common sense enough to hold his place, and at the same time to prove himself qualified for it. In all doubtful cases he was in the habit of consulting <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> learned legal friends, and the result was that his decisions were by no means held in low repute in the courts of law. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1576--"><year reg="1576">1576</year></datestruct>, to oblige Queen Bess, Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely, granted to her Majesty's handsome Lord Chancellor the gate-house of the palace (excepting <QUOTE><num value="2">two</num> rooms used as prisons for those who were arrested or delivered in execution to the bishop's bailiff, and the lower rooms used for the porter's lodge</QUOTE> ), the <num value="1">first</num> courtyard within the gatehouse, the stables, the long gallery, with the rooms above and below it, and some other apartments. Hatton also obtained <num value="14">fourteen</num> acres of ground, and the keeping of the gardens and orchards; and of this pleasant little domain he had a lease of twentyone years. The rent was not a heavy <num value="1">one</num>. A red rose was to be paid for the gate-house and garden, and for the ground <num value="10">ten</num> loads of hay and <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> sterling per annum. The grumbling bishop had to make the best of a bad bargain; and the only modification he could obtain in the terms was the insertion of a clause giving him and his successors free access through the gate-house, and, the right to walk in the garden, and gather <num value="20">twenty</num> baskets of roses yearly. 
<P>Once in possession of this property, Hatton began building and repairing, and soon contrived to expend   <measure value="1897l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1897">1,897</num></measure> <measure value="5s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="5">5</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> (about <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure> of our money), part of which amount, we may as well say here, was borrowed from his royal mistress. As he went on, his views expanded, and, not satisfied with what he had, he petitioned Queen Elizabeth to alienate to him the whole house and gardens. This, in days when sovereigns laid greedy hands on so many acres of rich Church property, was no unusual request, and the queen wrote to the bishop. requesting him to demise the lands to her till such time as the see of Ely should reimburse Sir Christopher for the money he had laid out, and was still expending, in the improvement of the property. The bishop wrote an answer befitting the dignity of his position. <QUOTE>In his conscience,</QUOTE> he said, <QUOTE>he could not do it, being a piece of sacrilege.   When he became Bishop of Ely he had received certain farms, houses, and other things, which former pious princes had judged necessary for that place and calling; that these he had received, by the queen's favour, from his predecessors, and that of these he was to be a steward, not a scatterer; that he could not bring his mind to be so ill a trustee for his successors, nor to violate the pious wills of kings and princes, and, in effect, rescind their last testaments.</QUOTE> And he concluded by telling her that he could scarcely justify those princes who transferred things appointed for pious purposes to purposes less pious. 
<P>But arguments and moral reflections were thrown away on the queen, and the bishop had to consent to a conveyance of the property to her Majesty, who was to re-convey it to Hatton, but on condition that the whole should be redeemable on the payment of the sum laid out by Sir Christopher. 
<P>On the death of Dr. Cox, his successor, Dr. Martin Heton, seemed extremely unwilling to carry out this agreement, and in a fit of fury the queen sat down and wrote him <num value="1">one</num> of her most characteristic epistles :-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><emph rend=caps>Proud Prelate</emph>!--I understand you are backward in complying with your agreement: but I would have you know that I, who made you what you are, can unmake you; and if you do not forthwith fulfil your engagement, by--   I will immediately unfrock you. <emph rend=caps>Elizabeth.</emph></QUOTE>
 
<P>According to some writers, this letter was addressed to Bishop Cox; but it is of no great consequence: the sender is of more interest here than the receiver. 
<P>The debt of the Lord Chancellor to the Queen had now reached some <measure value="40000l." type=currency><num value="40000">forty thousand</num> pounds</measure>. His prudence had fallen asleep when he allowed her Majesty to become his principal creditor.   She required a settlement of their account, and poor Hatton was unable to produce the necessary funds. It killed him. There is something pathetic in the <pb id="P.519" n="519"> quaint account which Fuller gives of the close of his prosperous life and fortunes. <QUOTE>It broke his heart,</QUOTE> says the biographer of the <QUOTE>Worthies,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>that the queen, which seldom   gave loans, and never forgave due debts, rigorously demanded the present payment of some arrears which Sir Christopher did not hope to have remitted, and did only desire to have forborne : failing herein in his expectation, it went to his heart, and cast him into a mortal disease. The queen afterwards did endeavour what she could to recover him, bringing, as some say, cordial broths unto him with her own hands; but all would not do. There's no pulley can draw up a heart once cast down, though a queen herself should set her hand thereunto.</QUOTE> He died in Ely House in <datestruct value="1591--"><year reg="1591">1591</year></datestruct>. 
<P>The scenes in Ely Place during Hatton's days must often have been gay enough. 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Full oft within the spacious walls, 
<L>When he had <num value="50">fifty</num> winters o&lsquo;er him, 
<L>My grave lord-keeper led the brawls- 
<L>The seal and maces danced before him. 
<L>His bushy beard and shoe-strings green, 
<L>His high-crowned hat and satin doublet, 
<L>Moved the stout heart of England's queen, 
<L>Though Pope and Spaniard could not trouble it.</QUOTE>
 So Gray, in his <title>Long Story,</title> wrote of Hatton in his manor house of Stoke Pogis; and in his town residence we can picture him quite as eager as in the country to shake the light fantastic toe, and cutting quite as quaint a figure as there. 
<P>It was in Ely House that Sir Edward Coke courted the rich widow, Lady Hatton, relict of the nephew of Sir Christopher, Queen Elizabeth's Lord Chancellor. The lady was young, beautiful, eccentric, and, it would seem, possessed of a most vixenish temper.   As she was rich, she had no scarcity of wooers, and among them were <num value="2">two</num> celebrated men, Coke and Bacon. Many a curious scene must Hatton House have witnessed, as those <num value="2">two</num> rivals in law pursued their rivalry in love, and cherished their long-felt enmity towards each other. Bacon's ever-faithful friend, the unfortunate Earl of Essex, pled his cause hard with the enchanting widow   and with her mother.   To the latter he says, in <num value="1">one</num> of his letters, <QUOTE>If she were my sister or my daughter, I protest I would as confidently resolve to further it as I now persuade you;</QUOTE> and in another epistle he adds, <QUOTE>If my faith be anything, I protest, if I had <num value="1">one</num> as near me as she is to you, I had rather match her with him than with men of far greater titles.</QUOTE> However, Sir Edward Coke carried off the prize, such as it was, and bitterly did he afterwards repent it. 
<P>That the marriage was not a happy <num value="1">one</num> we have already told when speaking of thee entries in the register-books of St. Andrew's Church, Holborn. After her quarrel with her husband, Lady Hatton betook herself again to Ely House, and there she effectually repelled the entrance of Sir Edward. In Howell's <title>Letters</title> we catch a sight of her in <num value="1">one</num> of her peculiar humours. He is speaking of Gondomar, the Spanish Ambassador. <QUOTE>He hath waded already very deep,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>and ingratiated himself with divers persons of quality, ladies especially: yet he could do no good upon the Lady Hatton; whom he desired lately, that in regard he was her next neighbour [at Ely House], he might have the benefit of her back-gate to go abroad into the fields, but she put him off with a compliment: whereupon, in a private audience lately with the king, among other passages of merriment,. he told him that my Lady Hatton was a strange lady, for she would not suffer her husband to come in at her fore-door, nor him to go out at her back-door, and so related the whole business.</QUOTE> 
<P>The <QUOTE>strange lady,</QUOTE> as she is called by Howell, <QUOTE>dyed in London on the <datestruct VALUE="1646-01-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct>, at her house in Holborne.</QUOTE> 
<P>During the anxious period of the civil war, Ely Place was turned to good account, and made use of both as an hospital and a prison. We may show this by the following extracts from the Journals of the House of Commons :--

The palace was this day ordered to be converted into a prison, and John Hunt, sergeant-at-arms, appointed keeper during the pleasure of the House.

<P>Malcolm gives a lamentable account of the inconvenience and mortification to which the bishops were in succession subjected in consequence of the unfortunate lease given to the Hatton family. <pb id="P.520" n="520"> He is speaking of the latter part of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century:--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>The gate-house, was taken down, and great part of the dwelling, and their lordships were compelled to enter the apartments reserved for their use by the old back way; several of the cellars, even under the rooms they occupied, were in possession of tenants; and those intermixed with their own, all of which had windows and passages into the cloisters. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> half of the crypt under the chapel, which had been used for interments, was then frequented as a drinking place, where liquor was retailed; and the intoxication of the people assembled often interrupted the offices of religion above them. Such were the encroachments of the new buildings, that the bishop had. his horses brought through the great hall, for want of a more proper entrance.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Some of the most memorable of feasts have been held here, the Bishops of Ely, in the true spirit of hospitality, having apparently been in the habit of lending their hall for the festive gatherings of the newly-elected serjeants of law. No doubt the halls of the Inns of Court were often too small to accommodate the number of guests. We shall notice <num value="3">three</num> of these serjeants' merry-makings. The <num value="1">first</num> took place in Michaelmas Term, <datestruct value="1464--"><year reg="1464">1464</year></datestruct>, and is noticeable for the fact that the Lord Mayor took great offence at a slight which the learned gentlemen unthinkingly put upon him. He came to the banquet, and found a certain nobleman- Grey of Ruthin, then Lord Treasurer of England --preferred before him, and sitting in the seat of state. That seat, by custom, he held, should have been occupied by himself; so, in high dudgeon, his lordship marched off, with his following of aldermen, to his own house, where he compensated his faithful adherents by a splendid entertainment, including all the delicacies of the season. He was wonderfully displeased, says Stow, at the way in which he had been treated, <QUOTE>and the new serjeants   and others were right sorry therefore, and had rather than much good (as they said) it had not so happened.</QUOTE> 
<P>Another banquet took place in <datestruct value="1495--"><year reg="1495">1495</year></datestruct> and on this occasion Henry VII. was present, with his queen. This was <num value="1">one</num> of the occasions, it has been pointed out, when the victor of Bosworth strove to correct a little the effect of his sordid habits, his general seclusion, and his gloomy, inscrutable nature, which altogether prevented him from obtaining the popularity which is agreeable to most monarchs-even to those the least inclined to purchase it at any considerable cost. <QUOTE>The king,</QUOTE> says his great historian, Bacon, <QUOTE>to honour the feast, was present with his queen at the dinner, being a prince that was ever ready to grace and countenance the professors of the law; having a little of that, that as he governed his subjects by his laws, so he governed his laws by his lawyers.</QUOTE> 
<P>But the last feast we shall mention was the most splendid of all. <num value="11">Eleven</num> serjeants had been created in <datestruct VALUE="1531-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1531">1531</year></datestruct>, and it was resolved to celebrate the event on an unparalleled scale of magnificence. The entertainment lasted <num value="5">five</num> days, and on the <num value="4">fourth</num> day the proceedings were graced by the presence of Henry VIII. and his queen, Catherine of Aragon; but these <num value="2">two</num> dined <QUOTE>in <num value="2">two</num> chambers,</QUOTE> Stow parenthetically observes. At this very time the final measures were in progress for the divorce of the unfortunate queen, and Henry's marriage with Anne Boleyn.   Besides these distinguished personages, the foreign ambassadors were there, and they also had a chamber to themselves. In the hall, at the chief table, sat Sir Nicolas Lambard, Lord Mayor of London, and with him were the judges, Barons of the Exchequer, and certain aldermen. The Master of the Rolls and the Master of the Chancery were supported at the board on the south side by many worshipful citizens, and on the north side of the hall there were other aldermen and merchants of the City. The remainder of the company, comprising knights, esquires, and gentlemen, were accommodated in the gallery and the cloisters, and, there being, apparently, a great scarcity of room, even in the chapel. 
<P> <QUOTE>It would be tedious,</QUOTE> says Stow, to set down all <QUOTE>the preparation of fish, flesh, and other victuals, spent in this feast;</QUOTE> and he hints that no <num value="1">one</num> would believe him if he did.

And the feast, says the honest historian, <QUOTE>wanted little of a feast at a coronation.</QUOTE> 
<P>No doubt it was at Ely Place that a ludicrous scene took place between the Bishop of Ely and <num value="2">two</num> bailiffs, about the close of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century--the conclusion of an adventure with the celebrated comedian, Joe Haines. Haines (who died in <datestruct value="1701--"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>) was always indulging in practical jokes and swindling tricks, and meeting with <pb id="P.521" n="521"> comical adventures.   <num value="1">One</num> day he was arrested by <num value="2">two</num> bailiffs for a debt of <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pounds</measure>, just as the Bishop of Ely was riding by in his carriage. Quoth Joe to the bailiffs, <QUOTE>Gentlemen, here is my cousin, the Bishop of Ely; let me but speak a word to him, and he will pay the debt and costs.</QUOTE> The bishop ordered his carriage to stop, whilst Joe-quite a stranger to him-whispered in his ear, <QUOTE>My lord, here are a couple of poor waverers, who have such terrible scruples of conscience that I fear they will hang themselves.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Very well,</QUOTE> replied the bishop. So, calling to the bailiffs, he said, <QUOTE>You <num value="2">two</num> men, come to me to-morrow, and I will satisfy you.</QUOTE> The bailiffs bowed, and went their way. Joe, tickled in the midriff, and hugging himself with his device, took himself off. The next morning the bailiffs repaired to Ely Place. <QUOTE>Well, my good men,</QUOTE> said his lordship, <QUOTE>what are your scruples of conscience?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Scruples!</QUOTE> replied they, <QUOTE>we have no scruples ; we are bailiffs, my lord, who yesterday arrested your cousin, Joe Haines, for <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pounds</measure>. Your lordship promised to satisfy us to-day; and we hope you will be as good as your word.</QUOTE> The bishop, to prevent any further scandal to his name, immediately paid all that was owing. 
<P>A   scene almost without a parallel was once arranged in Ely Place. This was a famous masque, with its attendant anti-masque, which came off during the brilliant part of the reign of the ill-fated Charles I. <QUOTE>Not the least interesting circumstances,</QUOTE> it has been observed, <QUOTE>attending the splendid pageant, are the character and position of the men who had the management of the affair, and of him who has made himself its historian.</QUOTE> This last was Whitelock, the learned and estimable lawyer, who, during the period preceding, comprising, and following the Commonwealth, enjoyed the respect of all parties, and has left us <num value="1">one</num> of the most valuable records of the momentous events he witnessed and in which he took a part. That his heart was in this masque and anti-masque is evident from the enthusiasm with which he describes both, and the space which he devotes to them in his great work. 
<P>The year before this gorgeous display, the irrepressible Mr. Prynne had published his <title>Histrio- Mastix,</title> in which he discharged a perfect broadside of abuse against   plays and players, masques and masquers, and generally against all kinds of sport and pastime.   The Queen Henrietta Maria, not long before, had engaged in some sort of theatrical performance with her maids of honour. The book was therefore offensive to the whole court, and no doubt to this circumstance the writer owed in part the infamous severity of his punishment. But before he took his turn in the pillory, and lost his ears, the members of the <num value="4">four</num> Inns of Court designed a masque, <QUOTE>as an expression of their love and duty to their majesties.</QUOTE> It was whispered to them from the court that it would be well taken from them; and some held it the more seasonable, because this action would manifest the difference of their opinion from Mr. Prynne's new   learning, and serve to confute his <title>Histrio- Mastix</title> against interludes. It was therefore agreed by the benchers to have the solemnity performed in the most nobly and stately manner that could be invented. 
<P>A   committee was formed, consisting of <num value="2">two</num> members from   each House; among the committee-men being Whitelock himself, Edward Hyde (who afterwards became Lord Clarendon), and the famous Selden. They set to work, and Whitelock's part in the   arrangements was to superintend the music. This he did with energy. <QUOTE>I made choice,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>of Mr. Simon Ivy, an honest and able musician, of excellent skill in his art, and of Mr. Lawes (a name familiar to every lover of Milton) to compose the airs, lessons, and songs for the masque, and to be master of all the music, under me.</QUOTE> He goes on to tell what meetings   he had of <QUOTE>English, French, Italian, German, and other masters of music; <num value="40">forty</num> lutes at <num value="1">one</num> time, beside other instruments in concert.</QUOTE> At last everything was arranged, and <num value="1">one</num> Candlemas, in the afternoon, <QUOTE>the masquers, horsemen, musicians, dancers, and all that were actors in this business, according to order, met at Ely House, in Holborn; there the grand committee sat all day to order all affairs; and when the evening was come, all things being in full readiness, they began to set forth in this order down   Chancery    Lane to Whitehall.</QUOTE> And here we can picture to ourselves the crowded streets, the enthusiastic spectators, the loyal lawyers, and Prynne and his sympathisers scowling and muttering in the background, all on a sharp evening in   <datestruct VALUE="1633-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>,   <year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>. 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>The <num value="1">first</num> that   marched were   <num value="20">twenty</num> footmen in scarlet liveries, with silver lace, each <num value="1">one</num> having his sword by his side, a baton in <num value="1">one</num> hand, and a lighted torch in the other; these were the marshal's men, who made way, and were about the marshal, waiting his commands. After them, and sometimes in the midst of them, came the marshal-then Mr. Darrel, afterwards knighted by the king: he was of Lincoln's Inn, an extraordinary handsome proper gentleman.   He was mounted upon <num value="1">one</num> of the king's best horses and richest saddles, and his own habit was exceeding rich and glorious, his horsemanship very gallant; and besides his marshal's men, he <pb id="P.522" n="522"> had <num value="2">two</num> lackeys who carried torches by him, and a page in livery that went by him carrying his cloak. After him followed <num value="100">one hundred</num> gentlemen of the Inns of Court, <num value="5">five</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num> chosen out of each house, of the most proper and handsome young gentlemen of the societies. Every <num value="1">one</num> of them was mounted on the best horses, and with the best furniture that the king's stables, and the stables of all the noblemen in town, could afford; and they were forward on this occasion to lend them   to the Inns of Court. Every <num value="1">one</num> of these <num value="100">hundred</num> gentlemen was in very rich clothes-scarce anything but gold and silver lace to be seen of them; and each gentleman had a page. and <num value="2">two</num> lackeys waiting on him, in his livery, by his horse's side; the 
<FIGURE id="Fig.522" n="2000.07.0187"><HEAD>Ely Chapel. (From A View By Malcolm.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 lackeys carried torches, and the page his master's cloak. The richness of their apparel and furniture, glittering by the light of a multitude of torches attending on them, with the motion and stirring of their mettled horses, and the many and various gay liveries of their servants, but especially the personal beauty and gallantry of the handsome young gentlemen, made the most glorious and splendid show that ever was beheld in England. 
<P>After the horsemen came the anti-masquers, and, as the horsemen had their music--about a dozen of the best trumpeters proper for them, and in their livery-sounding before them-so the <num value="1">first</num> anti-masquers, being of cripples and beggars on horseback, had their music of keys and tongs, <pb id="P.523" n="523"> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.523" n="2000.07.0188"><HEAD>Ely House. (From A Drawing Made In <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="P.524" n="524"> and the like, snapping; and   yet playing in a concert, before them.   These beggars were also mounted, but on the poorest, leanest jades that could be gotten out of the dirt-carts or elsewhere; and the variety and change from such noble music and gallant horses as went before them unto their proper music and pitiful horses, made both of them more pleasing.   The habits and properties of these cripples and beggars were most ingeniously fitted (as of all the rest) by the committee's direction, wherein (as in the whole business) Mr. Attorney Noy, Sir John Finch, Sir Edward Herbert, Mr. Selden, those great and eminent persons, and all the rest of the committee, had often meetings, and took extraordinary care and pains in the ordering of this business, and it seemed a pleasure to them. 
<P>After the beggars' anti-masque came men on horseback playing upon pipes, whistles, and instruments sounding notes like those of birds of all sorts, and in excellent concert, and were followed by the anti-masque of birds.   This was an owl in an ivy-bush, with many several sorts of other birds in a cluster, gazing, as it were, upon her. These were little boys put into covers of the shapes of those birds, rarely fitted, and sitting   on small horses, with footmen going by them with torches in their hands; and there were some, besides, to look unto the children; and this was very pleasant to the beholders. 
<P>After this anti-masque came other musicians on horseback, playing upon bagpipes, hornpipes, and such kind of northern music, speaking the following anti-masque of projectors to be of the Scotch and northern quarters; and these, as all the rest, had many footmen, with torches, waiting on them.--<num value="1">First</num> in this anti-masque rode a fellow upon a little horse with a great bit in his mouth, and upon the man's head was a bit, with headstall and reins fastened, and signified a projector, who begged a patent that none in the kingdom might ride their horses but with such bits as they would buy of him. Then came another fellow, with a bunch of carrots upon his head, and a capon on his fist, describing a projector who begged a patent of monopoly as the <num value="1">first</num> inventor of the art to feed capons fat with carrots, and that none but himself might have use of that invention, and have the privilege for <num value="14">fourteen</num> years, according to the statute. Several other projectors were in like manner personated in this anti-masque; and it pleased the spectators the more because by it an information was covertly given to the   king of the unfitness and ridiculousness of these projects against the law; and the Attorney Noy, who had most knowledge of them, had a great hand in this anti-masque of projectors.</QUOTE>
 
<P>Other anti-masques followed, and then came chariots with musicians, chariots with heathen gods and goddesses, then more chariots with musicians, <QUOTE>playing upon excellent and loud music,</QUOTE> and going immediately before the <num value="1">first</num> grand masquer's chariot.   This <QUOTE>was not so large as those that went before, but most curiously framed, carved and painted with an exquisite art, and purposely for this service and occasion,</QUOTE> Its colours were silver and crimson: <QUOTE>it was all over painted richly with these colours, even the wheels of it, most artificially laid on, and the carved work of it was as curious for that art, and it made a stately show. It was drawn with <num value="4">four</num> horses, all on breast, and they were covered to their heels all over with cloth of tissue, of the colours of crimson and silver, huge plumes of red and white feathers on their heads and buttocks; the coachman's cap and feather, his long coat, and his very whip and cushion, of the same stuff and colour.   In this chariot sat the <num value="4">four</num> grand masquers of Gray's Inn, their habits, doublets, trunk-hose, and caps of most rich cloth of tissue, and wrought as thick with silver spangles as they could be placed; large white silk stockings up to their trunk-hose, and rich sprigs in their caps, themselves proper and beautiful young gentlemen. On each side of the chariot were <num value="4">four</num> footmen, in liveries of the colour of the chariot, carrying huge flambeaux in their hands, which, with the torches, gave such a lustre to the paintings, the spangles, and habits, that hardly anything could be invented to appear more glorious.</QUOTE> Similar chariots, similarly occupied, followed from each of the other <num value="3">three</num> Inns of Court, the only difference being in the colours.   And in this manner the procession reached Whitehall, where the king, from a window of the Banqueting House--it might possibly be the very <num value="1">one</num> out of which he stepped to the scaffoldsaw, with his queen Henrietta Maria, the whole pageant pass before him. The royal spectators were so pleased with the show, that they sent a message to the marshal requesting him to conduct his following round the Tilt Yard opposite, that they might see it a <num value="2">second</num> time. This done, they entered the palace, where the masque, to which all this gorgeous spectacle was but a preliminary, began, and, says Whitelock, it was <QUOTE>incomparably performed, in the dancing, speeches, music, and scenes; the dances, figures, and properties; the voices, instruments, songs, airs, and composures; the words and actions were all of them exact, and none failed in their parts.</QUOTE> Henrietta Maria was so charmed, that she resolved to have the whole <pb id="P.525" n="525"> repeated shortly afterwards. The festivities concluded with dancing, when the queen and her ladies of honour were led out by the principal masquers. The expense of this spectacle was not less than <measure value="21000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="21000">21,000</num></measure>. Some of the musicians had <num value="100">100</num> apiece for their blowing and fiddling. 
<P>The last <QUOTE>mystery</QUOTE> represented in England was that of <title>Christ's Passion,</title> in the reign of James I., which, Prynne tells us, was <QUOTE>performed at Elie House, in Holborne, when Gondomar lay there, on Good Friday, at night, at which there were thousands present.</QUOTE> 
<P>This incident suggests <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> facts relating to the performance in England of miracle-plays and mysteries. These were founded on the lives of the saints, and on those parts of the Scriptures best represented by the latter term. About the earliest mention of a miracle-play is of the date of <datestruct value="1110--"><year reg="1110">1110</year></datestruct>, when <num value="1">one</num> was performed in the Abbey of St. Albans. Whether Geoffrey, a learned Norman, who composed this religious drama, then <num value="1">first</num> introduced the custom of acting such pieces, is by no means certain. London had plays representing the working of miracles and the sufferings of the saints about the year <datestruct value="1170"><year reg="1170">1170</year></datestruct>; so we learn from the monk Fitz-Stephen.   That these exhibitions <QUOTE>were well attended,</QUOTE> says Malcolm, in his 
<title>Manners and Customs of London,</title> <QUOTE>we cannot doubt for a moment, as there was a double inducement, compounded of curiosity and devotion. Piers Plowman and Chaucer both confirm the fact of the general approbation with which they were received.</QUOTE> They were, it is certain, introduced into England from the Continent. 
<P>As an interesting specimen of the <QUOTE>mysteries,</QUOTE> we may take the play of <title>Noah</title>, preserved in the Towneley collection. It will serve as an example of the corrupt and not very reverent manner in which the events of Scripture history were, during the Middle Ages, communicated to the common people. When Noah carries to his wife the news of the impending Flood, she is introduced abusing him for his credulity, sneering at him as an habitual bearer of bad tidings, and complaining of the hard life she leads with him. He tells her to <QUOTE>hold her tongue,</QUOTE> but she only becomes more abusive, till he is provoked to strike her. She. returns the blow with interest, and they fall to fighting, till Noah has had enough of it, and runs off as hard as he can to his work. When the ark is finished there is another quarrel, for Noah's wife laughs at the structure, and declares she will never go into it. But the water rises fast, and the danger becomes so great, that she changes her mind and jumps on board, only, however, to pick another quarrel with her husband. They fight again, but this time Noah comes off victorious, and his partner complains of being beaten <QUOTE>blue,</QUOTE> whilst their <num value="3">three</num> sons lament over the family discord. 
<P>The chapel of Ely Place, still standing, was dedicated to St. Etheldreda.   And who was she? She was the daughter of Anna, King of the West Angles, and was born in Suffolk, about the year <datestruct value="630"><year reg="630">630</year></datestruct>. She took part in the erection of the cathedral of Ely, and in course of time was elected to fill the position of its patron saint.   She died, in <num value="679">679</num>, the abbess of the convent of Ely. Sometimes St. Etheldreda is called by the more homely name of St. Audry; and from this <num value="2">second</num> appellation is derived the familiar adjective <hi rend=italics>tawdry</hi>. It is a digression, but we may as well tell how this came about. At the fair of St. Audry, at Ely, in the olden time, a description of cheap necklaces used to be sold, which under the name of <hi rend=italics>tawdry laces,</hi>
 were long very popular.   In process of time the epithet <hi rend=italics>tawdry</hi> came to be applied to any piece of glittering tinsel or shabby magnificence. 
<P>The builder of the chapel is unknown, but Malcolm conjectures that it is to Thomas Arundel that we are indebted for this beautiful but solitary fragment, <QUOTE>now left for the admiration of the antiquary and man of taste--the product of an architect familiar with the rich fancy of the Edwardian style, fully indulged in the grand east window.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>In spite of patchings and modernisings,</QUOTE> says Mr. J. Saunders, in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>St. Etheldreda's Chapel retains much of its original aspect.   On looking at the exterior, if we shut our eyes to the lower portion, where a part of the window has been cut away, and an entrance made where evidently none was ever intended to exist, we perceive the true stamp of the days when men built the cathedralsworks which no modern art has rivalled, and which yet seemed so easy to them, that the names of the architects have failed to be preserved. And in the interior the effect of the <num value="2">two</num> windows, alike in general   appearance, yet differing in every respect in   detail, is magnificent, although   the storeyed panes, which we may be sure once filled them, are gone.   The bold arch of the ceiling, plain and whitewashed though now be its surface, retains so much of the old effect, that, though we miss the fine oak carvings, we do not forget them. The noble row of windows on each side are in a somewhat similar condition.   All their exquisite tracery has disappeared, but their number, height, and size tell us what they must have been in the palmy days of Ely Place;   and if we are still at a loss, there is fortunately ample evidence remaining in the ornaments which surround the upper por- <pb id="P.526" n="526">

 tions of the windows in the interior, and divide them from each other.   We scarcely remember anything more exquisite in architecture than the fairy workmanship of the delicate, pinnacle-like ornaments which rise between and overtop these windows. Of the original entrances into the chapel <num value="1">one</num> only remains, which is quite unused, and is situated at the south-west corner of the edifice. Stepping through the doorway into a small court that encloses it, we perceive that it has been a very beautiful, deeply-receding, pointed arch, but now so greatly decayed that even the character of its ornaments is but partially discoverable. Here, too, is a piece of the wall of <num value="1">one</num> of the original buildings of the palace--a stupendous piece of brickwork and masonry; and on looking up, <num value="1">one</num> of the octagonal buttresses, with its conical top, which ornamented the angles of the building, is seen.

<P>Leaving the gates of Ely Place we turn westwards, and pursue our way along the main thoroughfare of Holborn.   And, to begin, let us speak of the divisions of this street. From Farringdon Street to Fetter Lane used to be known as Holborn Hill; from Fetter Lane to Brooke Street as Holborn, and from Brooke Street to Drury Lane as High Holborn. Since the recent alterations and improvements, Holborn extends from   Holborn Viaduct to Holborn Bars, and High Holborn from the Bars to Drury Lane. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> great improvements effected in Holborn was its being paved, in <datestruct value="1417--"><year reg="1417">1417</year></datestruct>, at the expense of Henry V., when the highway, we learn <pb id="P.527" n="527">

 from   Rymer's <title lang=la>Foedera,</title> <QUOTE>was so deep and miry that many perils and hazards were   thereby occasioned, as well to the king's carriages   passing that way as to those of his subjects.</QUOTE> 
<P>In   <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.527.4">Holborn</LEMMA>, at what is now   Farringdon   Street, there was of old   a stone   bridge         over the Fleet, called <QUOTE>Oldbourne Bridge.</QUOTE> Stow thus describes this locality:-- <QUOTE>Old borne or Hilborne, breaking out about the place where now the Bars do stand, and it ran down the whole street till Oldborne Bridge, and into the river of the Wells or Turnemill Brook. This bourn was likewise long since stopped up at the head, and in other places where the same hath broken out, but yet till this day the said street is here called High Oldborne Hill, and both the sides thereof, together with all the grounds adjoining, that lie betwixt it and the river of Thames, remain full of springs, so that water is there found at hand, and hard to be stopped in every house.</QUOTE> 
<P>Agas's map of London, in the time of Elizabeth, represents Holborn as a very different sort of a place from what it is now. All the ground from Shoe Lane to Chancery Lane   was then gardens with trees and shrubs; and long before Agas's day part of that space was a rural region belonging to the see   of Bangor. 
<P>Holborn in the beginning of this century is described by Malcolm, the careful compiler of 
<title>Londinium Redivivum.</title> <QUOTE>Holborn,</QUOTE> he says, writing in <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>is an irregular long street, narrow and inconvenient at the north end of Fleet Market, but widening from   Shoe Lane, up the hill, westward; thence to Middle Row, or the south end of Gray's Inn Lane.   It is an excellent broad and dry place, or oblong square.</QUOTE> In the additional Act for rebuilding London, <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, it was enacted <QUOTE>that the passage to Holborn Bridge is too strait and narrow, incommodious for the many passengers daily using and frequenting the same, and it is therefore necessary to be enlarged:   that it may be lawful for the Mayor, &:, to make it run in    a bevil line from   a certain timber-house on the north side thereof, named the Cock, to the Swan Inn, on the north side of   Holborn Hill.</QUOTE> 
<P>Holborn was anciently of much consequence, not only on account of the many eminent people who resided here, but because of the Inns of Court, which graced   both its north and    south sides. Besides, it contained an   hospital for   the   poor,     and a cell to the house of Clugny in France, suppressed with the Priories Alien. 
<P> <QUOTE>Holborn Bars</QUOTE> used   to stand a little west of Brooke Street.   They marked   the termination of the City Liberties in that direction.   The <hi rend=italics>spot is</hi>
 now shown by <num value="2">two</num> granite obelisks bearing the City arms.   The Corporation of London formerly received a penny and <num value="2">two</num>-penny toll from   the carts and carriages of non-freemen entering the City.   These tolls were levied at the <num value="6">six</num> bars, including Holborn Bars.   The richest inlets were Temple Bar and Whitechapel Bar. 
<P>The Middle Row, Holborn, has disappeared, like the Bars. This was a block of houses which stood half blocking up the street at the south end of Gray's Inn Lane.   For at least a couple of centuries it was considered an obstruction. Howel, in his <title>Perlustration of London,</title> <datestruct value="1657--"><year reg="1657">1657</year></datestruct> (p. <num value="344">344</num>), says :--a <QUOTE>Southward of Gray's Inn Lane there is a row of small houses, which is a mighty hindrance to Holborn, in point of prospect, which if they were taken down there would be from Holborn Conduit to St. Giles-in-the-Fields <num value="1">one</num> of the fairest rising streets in the world.</QUOTE> The obstructive buildings were at last made an end of in <datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>. There is a view of the old Row in Faithorne's ichnographical delineation of London in the reign of Charles I. 
<P>Holborn was the old road from Newgate and the Tower to the gallows at Tyburn.   At regular and frequent intervals both sides of the way were lined and all the windows were covered with curious and often sympathising spectators to see light-fingered gentlemen, murderers, forgers, and such like, riding to their doom.

<P>It is told in Tom   Brown's works that an old counsellor who lived in Holborn used every execution-day to give his clerks a half-holiday, sending them to see the show, and giving them this piece of advice: <QUOTE>Go, ye young rogues, go to school, and improve!</QUOTE> 
<P>The Holborn line of road was selected for the cruel whippings which Titus Oates and Dangerfield had to suffer, in the reign of   James II. Titus Oates, as every <num value="1">one</num> knows, was the chief informer in what was called the   Popish   plot; a plot, as he pretended to prove, that was   promoted for the destruction of the Protestant religion in   England. Several persons of quality were tried and executed chiefly on his evidence, and Oates, in return for his kind and timely information, received a pension of <measure value="1200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1200">1,200</num></measure> a year, and was lodged   in Whitehall. Scarcely, however, had King James II. ascended the throne, than he was cast into prison, and tried for perjury with respect to what he had asserted regarding the alleged plot. Being convicted, he was sentenced to stand in the pillory <num value="5">five</num> times a year during his life,   to   whipped from Aldgate to Newgate, and from thence to Tyburn; which sentence, says Neal, was exercised with a severity unknown to the English nation. <QUOTE>The imprudence of the man,</QUOTE> says the historian Hume, <QUOTE>supported itself under the conviction, and his courage under the punishment.   He made solemn appeals to Heaven, and protestations of the veracity of   his testimony.   Though the whipping was so cruel that it was evidently the intention of the Court to put him to death by that punishment, yet he was enabled, by the care of his friends, to recover, and he lived to King William's reign, when a pension of <measure value="400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400">400</num></measure>   a year was settled upon him. A considerable number of persons adhered to him in his distress, and regarded him as a martyr to the Protestant cause.</QUOTE> He died in <datestruct value="1705--"><year reg="1705">1705</year></datestruct>. Hume describes him as the most infamous of mankind, and tells us that in early life he had been chaplain to Colonel Pride, and that he was afterwards chaplain on board, the fleet, whence he had been ignominiously dismissed.   He then became a convert to the Roman Catholics, but used to boast in after years that his conversion was a mere pretence, which he made in order to get into their secrets and betray them. 
<P>The gentle Evelyn saw   the Holborn part of Oates' punishment inflicted.   He has this entry in his <title>Diary,</title> on the <datestruct VALUE="1685-05-22"><day reg="22">22nd</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>: <QUOTE>Oates, who had but <num value="2">two</num> days before been pilloried at several places, and whipped at the cart's tail from Newgate to Aldgate, was this day placed on a sledge, being not able to go, by reason of so late scourging, and dragged from prison to Tyburn, and whipped again all the way, which some thought to be very severe and extraordinary: but if he was guilty   of the perjuries, and so of the death of so many innocents, as I fear he was, <hi rend=italics>his punishment was but what he deserved</hi>. I chanced to pass just as execution was doing on him--a strange revolution.</QUOTE> 
<P>Dangerfield, who had been the inventor of the 
<title>Meal-Tub Plot,</title> was condemned, in the same year, to about as severe a punishment as Oates. He was ordered to stand twice in the pillory; to be whipped from Aldgate to Newgate on <num value="1">one</num> day, and from Newgate to Tyburn on another; and to pay a fine of   <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>.   He was not made of such tough material as his brother scoundrel, Oates. He <QUOTE>was struck with such horror at this terrible sentence, that he looked upon himself as a dead man, and accordingly chose a text for his funeral sermon, but persevered in asserting that all he had delivered in evidence before the House of Commons was true. The whipping was executed with full rigour, as before upon Oates, and was scarce over before <num value="1">one</num> Mr. Robert Frances, a barrister, of Gray's Inn, gave him a wound with his cane in or near the eye, which, according to the deposition of the surgeon, was the cause of his death.</QUOTE> This furious barrister, Mr. Frances, was consequently tried for the murder, and as it was found that the popular feeling, was very violent against him, it was judged a politic proceeding to permit his conviction and execution. 
<P>So much for general observations upon Holborn. The <num value="1">first</num> object which catches the eye as we look about for particulars on which to comment, is the statue erected to the memory of the late Prince Consort in Holborn Circus. This statue was unveiled on Friday, the <datestruct VALUE="1874-01-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>. It is a gift from a   patriotic gentleman, who desires to remain unknown,   to the Corporation of London. The prince is represented as responding to a salute. The pedestal, which is composed of stones weighing <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="10">ten</num> tons each, includes <num value="2">two</num> sitting figures illustrating History and Peace, and bas-reliefs illustrating important events in Prince Albert's life. The statue is the work of Mr. Bacon.      The pedestal is the joint design of the sculptor and Mr. William Haywood. 
<P>We must not forget to speak of an inn called the <QUOTE>Rose,</QUOTE> which stood formerly on Holborn Hill, and only disappeared within the recollection of the present generation.   From   it Taylor the <pb id="P.531" n="531"> water-poet started in the Southampton coach for the Isle of Wight on the <datestruct VALUE="1647-10-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct>, while Charles I. was there.

 So says Taylor in the beginning of his <title>Travels from London to the Isle of Wight.</title>
 
<P>Union Court, situated over against St. Andrew's Church, was originally called Scroop's Court. It derived this name from the noble family of Scrope of Bolton, who had a town house here, which was afterwards let to the serjeants-at-law.   It ceased, it is said, to be a serjeants' inn about the year <datestruct value="1498"><year reg="1498">1498</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Bartlett's Buildings, on the south side of Holborn, is described by Strype as <QUOTE>a very handsome place, graced with good buildings of brick, with gardens behind the houses,</QUOTE> and he adds, that it is a region <QUOTE>very well inhabited by gentry, and persons of good repute.</QUOTE> Were Strype to come alive again, he would not recognise the locality.   Bartlett's Buildings is mentioned in the burial register of St. Andrew's (the parish in which it lies) as far back as <datestruct VALUE="1615-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1615">1615</year></datestruct>, and it is there called Bartlett's Court. 
<P>We read in Thoresby's Diary, <QUOTE><datestruct VALUE="1714-05-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct>.- At the meeting of the Royal Society, where was Sir Isaac Newton, the president.

But I left all to go with Mr. Chamberlayn to Bartlett's Buildings, to the other society, viz., that for promoting Christian Knowledge, which is to be preferred to all other learning.</QUOTE> 
<P>In Dyers' Buildings, the site of some almshouses of the Dyers' Company, lived <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.531.1">William Roscoe</LEMMA> when he published his edition of Pope's Works, with notes and a life of the poet, <num value="10">10</num> vols. <num value="8">8</num>vo, <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>. <num value="1">One</num> of the principal objects of this new edition was to give a fuller and more accurate life of the poet than had yet appeared. Of the various biographical notices of him, it is not unjust to say that there was not <num value="1">one</num> worthy of the subject.   The <title>Quarterly Review</title> (<datestruct VALUE="1825-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>), in summing up the merits of Mr. Roscoe's work, says, <QUOTE>His original criticism is not much, but is enlightened and liberal; and the candour with which that and the life are written, is quite refreshing after the blighting perversity of the preceding editors, whose misrepresentations and calumnies he has industriously   examined   and patiently refuted, with a lucid arrangement both of facts and arguments.</QUOTE> 
<P>At the corner of Furnival's Inn, on the opposite side of the street from Dyers' Buildings, Edward Kidder, the famous pastry-cook, had a school. He had another establishment in St. Martin's-le-Grand. and in these <num value="2">two</num> places is said to have taught, from. <num value="1">first</num> to last, nearly <num value="6000">six thousand</num> ladies the delightful art of making pastry.

<P>And now crossing the street again we come to Castle Street, which runs from   Holborn into Cursitor Street.   Its proper name is Castle Yard, perhaps from the name of Castle Inn, on the site of which it is built; Lord Arundel, the great collector of art and antiquities, was living in <datestruct value="1619--"><year reg="1619">1619</year></datestruct>-<num value="20">20</num> in <QUOTE>Castle Yard, in Holborn.</QUOTE> And here died Lady Davenant, the <num value="1">first</num> wife of Sir William Davenant, the poet. 
<P>And having by Castle Street reached Cursitor Street, we. may as well say a little about it, having omitted to do so in the beginning of our pilgrimage when speaking of Chancery Lane, of which it is a tributary. It is named after the Cursitor's Office or Inn, founded by   <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.531.2">Sir Nicholas Bacon</LEMMA>, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England, and father of the famous Lord   Bacon.   Stow, speaking of Chancery Lane, says, <QUOTE>In this street the <num value="1">first</num> fair building to be noted on the east side is called the Cursitor's Office: built with divers fair lodgings for gentlemen, all of brick and timber, by Sir Nicholas Bacon, late Lord Keeper of the Great Seal.</QUOTE> Cursitor is said to be a corruption of chorister, and this seemeth the more probable, because <QUOTE>anciently all or the most part of the officers and ministers of Chancery, or Court of Conscience (for so the Chancery hath been called) were churchmen, divines, and canonists.</QUOTE> The business of the Cursitors is to make out and issue writs in the name of the Court of Chancery. 
<P>When passing once through Cursitor Street with his secretary, Lord Chancellor Eldon said: <QUOTE>Here was my <num value="1">first</num> perch; how often have I run down to Fleet Market with sixpence in my hand to buy sprats for supper.</QUOTE> 
<P>It was here he lived with that pretty young wife whom he married so imprudently, though he used in after life to reflect upon the step as <num value="1">one</num> of the most fortunate of hid early career. <QUOTE>The romance of the law,</QUOTE> says Mr. Jeaffreson, <QUOTE>contains few more pleasant episodes than the story of the elopement of Jack Scott (afterwards Lord Eldon) with Bessie <pb id="P.532" n="532"> Surtees.

Who is ignorant of the story? Does not every visitor to Newcastle pause before an old house in Sandhill, and look up at the blue pane which marks the window from which Bessie descended into her lover's arms?</QUOTE> After a short residence at Oxford, the future Lord Eldon naturally came (as mostly all talent does come) to London, and established himself in a humble little house in Cursitor Street.   The pretty, wife made it cheerful for him.   He had in after life to regret her peculiarities, her stinginess, and her nervous repugnance to society; but he remained devoted in his attachment. <QUOTE>Poor Bessie!</QUOTE> he said, in his old age, after she was dead; <QUOTE>if ever there was an angel on earth, she was <num value="1">one</num>.

<P>Returning to Holborn and proceeding westward, we come to Southampton Buildings, built on the site of Southampton House.   They lie on the south side of Holborn, a little above Holborn Bars.   Speaking of the old mansion-house, Peter Cunningham, in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>, remarked that fragments still remained in his day. He was shown, in <datestruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></datestruct>, what was still called <QUOTE>the chapel</QUOTE> of the house, a building with rubble walls and a flat timbered roof. The occupant also told him that his father remembered a pulpit in the chapel, and that he himself, when forming the foundation of a workshop adjoining, had seen portions of a circular building which   he   supposed to be part of the old temple mentioned in a passage from Stow, which we shall make the subject of the following paragraphs: 
<P> <QUOTE>Beyond the Bars [Holborn Bars],</QUOTE> says Stow, had ye in old time a temple built by the Templars, whose order <num value="1">first</num> began in <datestruct value="1118--"><year reg="1118">1118</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="19">nineteenth</num> of Henry I. This temple was left and fell to ruin since the year <datestruct value="1184"><year reg="1184">1184</year></datestruct>, when the Templars had builded them a new Temple in Fleet Street, near to the river of Thames. A great part of this old temple was pulled down but of late, in the year <datestruct value="1595"><year reg="1595">1595</year></datestruct>. 
<P> <QUOTE>Adjoining to this old temple was some time the Bishop of Lincoln's inn, wherein he lodged when he repaired to this city. Robert de Curars, Bishop of Lincoln; built it about the year <datestruct value="1147"><year reg="1147">1147</year></datestruct>. John Russell, Bishop of Lincoln, Chancellor of England in the reign of Richard III., was lodged there. It hath of late years belonged to the Earl of Southampton, and therefore called Southampton House. Master Roper hath of late much built there, by means whereof part of the ruins of the old temple are seen to remain, built of Caen stone, round in form as the new Temple by Temple Bar, and other temples in England.</QUOTE> 
<P>We must not forget that in Southampton House, Thomas, the last Earl of Southampton, the faithful and virtuous servant of Charles I., and Lord Treasurer in the beginning of the reign of Charles II., ended his days. Pennant, the historian, when he comes to this point in his <title>Account of London,</title>
 writes with all the pathos of an honest and feeling heart. <QUOTE>He died,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>in <datestruct value="1667--"><year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>, barely in possession of the white rod, which his profligate enemies were with difficulty dissuaded from wresting out of his dying hands. He had the happiness of marrying his daughter and heiress to a nobleman of congenial merit, the ill-fated Lord Russell. Her virtues underwent a fiery trial, and came out of the test if possible more pure. I cannot read of her last interviews with   her devoted lord without the strongest emotions. Her greatness of mind appears to uncommon advantage. The last scene is beyond the power of either pen or pencil. In this house they lived many years. When his lordship passed by it, on the way to execution, he felt a momentary bitterness of death in recollecting the happy moments of the place. He looked towards Southampton House, the tear started into his eye, but he instantly wiped it away.</QUOTE> 
<P>Southampton House was taken down and private tenements erected on the site in the middle of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. Howel, writing in <datestruct value="1657--"><year reg="1657">1657</year></datestruct>, mentioning this fact, breaks out in his quaint way: <QUOTE>If any <num value="1">one</num> should ask what the Almighty doth now in London, he might (as the pulse of the times beats) give the same answer that was given by the pagan philosopher, who, being demanded what Jupiter did in heaven, he said,  <Q>Jupiter breaks great vessels, and makes small ones of their pieces.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P>In Southampton Buildings, in the house of a relative, Ludlow, the Parliamentary general, lay <pb id="P.533" n="533"> concealed from the Restoration till the period of his escape.   And a very narrow escape it was. When the proclamation was issued by Charles II., requiring all the late king's judges to surrender themselves in <num value="14">fourteen</num> days, on pain of being left out of the act of indemnity, he determined to fly the country. He bade farewell to his friends, and went over London Bridge in a coach to St. George's Church in the borough of Southwark, where he took horse, and travelling all night, arrived at Lewes, in Sussex, by break of day next morning. Soon after, he went on board a small open vessel prepared for him; but the weather being very bad, he quitted that, and took shelter in a larger which had been   got ready, but it stuck in the sands going   down the river. He had hardly got on board this, when some persons   came to search that which he had just left. After waiting a night and a day for   the storm to   abate   (during which time the master of the   vessel asked him whether he had heard that   Lieutenant-General Ludlow was confined among the rest of the king's judges), he put to sea, and landed at Dieppe in the evening, before the gates were shut.       Having thus got him out of the reach of danger, we shall leave him, only waiting to tell the reader that he died at Vevay, in Switzerland, in <datestruct value="1693--"><year reg="1693">1693</year></datestruct>, his last wishes being for the prosperity,   peace, and   glory of his country. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> of the early coffee-houses of   London was established in Southampton Buildings. In the autobiography of Anthony Wood (ii. <num value="65">65</num>) we come upon the following passage in connection with the year <datestruct value="1650"><year reg="1650">1650</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>This year Jacob, a Jew, opened   a coffey-house at the Angel in the parish of St. Peter, in the East Oxon, and there it was by some, who delighted it noveltie, drank. When he left Oxon, he sold it in old Southampton Buildings, in Holborne, near London, and was living there in <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> 
<P>When coffee was <num value="1">first</num> introduced into England, about the middle of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, the new beverage, as was to be expected, had its opponents as well as its advocates. There were broadsides against coffee, just as there had been counterblasts against tobacco; but in spite of opposition it became a favourite drink, and the shops where it was sold grew to be places of general resort. They were frequented by <hi rend=italics>quidnuncs</hi>, and were the great marts for news of all kinds, true and false. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, a paternal Government issued a proclamation for shutting up and suppressing all coffeehouses. They found, however, that in making this proclamation they had gone a step too far. So early as this period the coffee-house had become a power in the land--as Macaulay tells us--a most important political institution, when public meetings, harangues, resolutions, and the rest of the machinery of agitation, had not come into fashion, and nothing like a newspaper existed.   In such circumstances the coffee-houses were the chief organs through which the public opinion of the metropolis vented itself. Consequently, on a petition of the merchants and retailers of coffee, permission was granted to keep the coffee-houses open for <num value="6">six</num> months, under an admonition that the masters of them   should prevent all scandalous papers, books, and libels from   being read in them, and hinder every person from declaring, uttering, or divulging all manner of false and scandalous reports against Government or the ministers thereof. The absurdity of constituting every maker of a cup of coffee a censor of the press was too great even for those days:   the proclamation was laughed at, and no more was heard of the suppression of coffee-houses. 
<P>Dr.   Birkbeck, in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, founded a Mechanics' Institution in Southampton   Buildings, for the dissemination of useful knowledge   among the industrious classes of the community, by means of lectures, classes, and a library. 
<P> <QUOTE>In inquiring,</QUOTE> says   a writer   from whom we have already quoted, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>into the origin of that movement for popular instruction which has occupied so broad a space during this century, we are met by the name of George Birkbeck standing out in conspicuous characters. The son of a banker at Settle, in Yorkshire, and reared as a medical practitioner, he was induced at an early   period of life to accept a professorship in what   was called the Andersonian Institution of Glasgow, a kind of popular university which had just then started into being. Here Birkbeck found great   difficulty      in   getting apparatus made for a course of lectures on Natural and Experimental Philosophy;   and   this suggested to him the establishment of popular lectures to working men, with a view to the spread of knowledge in various matters relating to the application of science to the practical arts.   This was the germ   from which   Mechanics' Institutions afterwards sprung. The trustees of the Andersonian Institution had not Birkbeck's enthusiasm; they deemed the scheme visionary, and refused at <num value="1">first</num> to support it. In the autumn of <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct> he went to Yorkshire for a vacation, and there digested a plan for forming a class solely for persons engaged in the practical exercise of the mechanical arts, men whose education in early life had precluded even the possibility of acquiring the smallest portion of scientific knowledge.   This mechanics' class was to be held in <num value="1">one</num> of the rooms of the Andersonian Institution. <pb id="P.534" n="534"> 
<P>On his return to Glasgow, he opened communications with the chief owners of manufacturing establishments, offering to the more intelligent workmen free admission to his class. The <num value="1">first</num> lecture. was attended by <num value="75">seventy-five</num> artisans; it excited so much interest, that <num value="200">two hundred</num> came to the <num value="2">second</num> lecture, <num value="300">three hundred</num> to the <num value="3">third</num>, and <num value="500">five hundred</num> to the <num value="4">fourth</num>. His grateful pupils presented him with a silver cup at the close of the course, as a token of their appreciation of his disinterested kindness.   He repeated these labours year after year till <datestruct value="1804"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct>, when he resigned his position at Glasgow to Dr. Ure, who, like him, was at that time struggling into fame. Birkbeck married, came to London, and settled down as a physician. 
<P>Many years elapsed during which Dr. Birkbeck was wholly absorbed in his professional duties. He did not, however, forget his early schemes, and as he advanced in life, he found or made opportunities for developing them.   In <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct> he gave a gratuitous course of lectures at the London Institution.      Gradually a wish spread in various quarters to put in operation the plan which had so long occupied the thoughts of Dr. Birkbeck-viz., to give instruction in science to working men.   In.

 <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>   a School of Arts was established in Edinburgh, chiefly through the instrumentality of Mr. Leonard Horner.   In <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct> a Mechanics' Institution was founded at Glasgow, and another in London, of which last Dr. Birkbeck was very appropriately elected president, an office he filled till his death, eighteen years afterwards.

The newly-established concern was at <num value="1">first</num> highly successful.   Men of great attainments offered their services as lecturers, and the lecture-hall very often contained a <num value="1000">thousand</num> persons listening with the greatest attention to discourses on astronomy, experimental philosophy, chemistry, physiology, the steam-engine, &amp;c.

<P>When the <num value="1">first</num> enthusiasm wore off, Mechanics' Institutions hardly realised, perhaps, the expectations of their founders.   The reasons for this have been thus set down by a careful observer:-- <QUOTE>In large towns,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>the energy   and enthusiasm that originated them   carried them on for a time; but as the   novelty wore off the members and revenue decreased, modifications of plan had to be adopted,   new features introduced, and radical changes made.   If these proved acceptable to the public, the institution flourished; if not,   it decayed. If the original idea of giving scientific education only were strictly carried   out, the number of members was small, while, if amusement took the place of study, the institution lived in jeopardy from the fickle, and changing taste for amusement on the part of the public.</QUOTE> 
<P>The Mechanics' Institution   in   Southampton Buildings has now departed considerably from   the design of the founder, and flourishes under the title of the Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution.

<P>The history of lotteries in England is an entertaining   <num value="1">one</num>.

The drawing began on the <datestruct value="01-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, at the west door of St. Paul's, and continued day and night   till the <datestruct value="05-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>. The scheme, which had been announced <num value="2">two</num> years before, shows that the   lottery consisted of <num value="40000">40,000</num> lots, or shares, at. <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> each, and that it comprehended <QUOTE>a great number of good prizes as well of ready money as of plate, and certain sorts of merchandise.</QUOTE> Any profit that might be   derived from the scheme was to be devoted to the reparation of harbours and other useful public works. The <num value="2">second</num> lottery, in <datestruct value="1612--"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>, was projected to benefit the new colony in Virginia, and there is a tradition that the principal prize-<num value="4000">4,000</num> crowns --was gained by a poor tailor. Down to   <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct> (except for a short time following upon an Act of Queen Anne) lotteries continued to be sanctioned by the English Government as a source of revenue. It seems strange, says a popular writer, that so glaringly immoral a project should have been kept up under such auspices so long.   The younger people at the present day may be at a loss to believe that, in the days of their fathers, there were large and imposing offices in London, such as this <num value="1">one</num> in Holborn, and pretentious agencies in the provinces, for the   sale of lottery-tickets; while flaming advertisements on walls, in new books, and in the public journals,   proclaimed the preferableness of such and such <QUOTE>lucky</QUOTE> offices--this <num value="1">one</num> having sold <num value="2">two</num>-sixteenths of the last <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure> prize, another having   sold   an entire <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure> ticket the year   before, and so on.   It was found possible to persuade the public, or a portion of it, that where a blessing had once lighted, it   was the more likely to light again.   The competition amongst the lottery-offices was intense.   <num value="1">One</num> firm, finding an old woman in the country of the name of Goodluck, gave her <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> a year, on condition she should join them as a nominal partner, for the sake of the attractive effect of her name.    In their advertisements each was sedulous to tell how many of the grand prizes had in former years fallen to the lot of persons who had bought at <hi rend=italics>his</hi> shop. 
<P> <QUOTE>The State lottery,</QUOTE> Dr. Chambers remarks, <QUOTE>was founded on the simple principle that the State held forth a certain sum, to be repaid by a larger. The transaction was usually managed thus: --The Government gave <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> in prizes for every share taken; on an average. A great many blanks, or of prizes under <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> left, of-course, a surplus for the creation of a   few magnificent prizes, wherewith to attract--the unwary public. Certain firms in the City, known as lottery-office keepers, contracted for the lottery, each taking a certain number of shares; the sum   paid by them   was always more than <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> per share, and the excess constituted the Government profit. It was customary for many years, for the contractors to give about <measure value="16l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="16">16</num></measure> to the Government, and then to charge the public from   <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> to   <measure value="22l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="22">22</num></measure>. It was made lawful for the contractors to divide the shares into halves, quarters, eighths, and sixteenths, and they always charged relatively more for these aliquot parts. A man with <measure value="30s." type=currency><num value="30">30</num>s.</measure> to spare could buy a <num value="16">sixteenth</num>,   and the contractors made a large portion of their profit out of such customers.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>The Government sometimes paid the prizes in terminable annuities, instead of cash, and the loan system   and the lottery system   were occasionally combined in a very odd way. Thus, in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, every subscriber of <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> towards a loan of <num value="2000000">2,000,000</num>, at <num value="4">four</num> per cent., received a bonus of <num value="4">four</num> lotterytickets, the value of each of which was <num value="10">10</num>, and any <num value="1">one</num> of which might be the fortunate number for a <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure> or <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure> prize.</QUOTE> 
<P>The culminating point in the history of lottery gambling appears to have been the year <datestruct value="1772"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>. The whole town then went crazed on the chance of making large gains by small ventures. There were lottery magazines, lottery tailors and dressmakers; lottery glovers, hat-makers, and tea-dealers; lottery snuff and pig-tail   merchants; lottery barbers, who promised, on payment of <measure value="3d." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>d.</measure>, to shave you and give you a chance of being paid   <num value="10">10</num>; lottery shoe-blacks ; lottery ordinaries, where <num value="1">one</num> might obtain, for <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>, a plate of beef and the chance of winning <num value="60">sixty</num> guineas; lottery oyster-stalls, where <measure value="3d." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>d.</measure> yielded a dozen of oysters and a very distant prospect of <num value="5">five</num> guineas; and, lastly, a sausagestall, in a blind alley, where you might, by purchasing a farthing's worth of sausages, should--the fates prove propitious, gain a bonus of <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure> 
<P>The demoralising effect of this state of affairs may be readily imagined.     By creating illusive hopes lotteries supplanted steady industry. Shopmen robbed their masters, servant-girls their mistresses, friends borrowed from each   other under false pretences, and husbands stinted their wives and   children   of necessaries--all to raise   the <pb id="P.538" n="538"> means for buying a portion or the whole of a lottery-ticket. There was no exaggeration in the report of a committee of the House of Commons, a considerable time prior to the abolition of lotteries in <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>, which remarked that <QUOTE>the foundation of the lottery is so radically vicious that under no system can it become an efficient source of gain, and yet be divested of the evils and calamities of which it has proved so baneful a source. Idleness, dissipation, and poverty are increased; sacred and confidential trusts are betrayed; domestic comfort is destroyed; madness often created; crimes subjecting the perpetrators to death are committed.   No mode of raising money appears so burdensome, pernicious, and unproductive. No species of adventure is known where the chances are so great against the adventurers, none where the infatuation is more powerful, lasting, and destructive. In the lower classes of society the persons engaged are, generally speaking, either immediately or ultimately tempted to their ruin; and there is scarcely any condition of life so destitute and so abandoned but its distresses have not been aggravated by this allurement to gaming.</QUOTE> 
<P>Amidst all this immoral and unhealthy excitement, however, many incidents occurred which, to read about at least, afford amusement. In <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>, for example, a lady in Holborn had a lottery-ticket presented to her by her husband, and on the Sunday preceding the drawing, her success was prayed for in the parish church-St. Andrew's, most probably--in this form: <QUOTE>The prayers of this congregation are desired for the success of a person engaged in a new undertaking.</QUOTE> Possibly she was <num value="1">one</num> of those who followed the lottery-loving clergy who used to defend the appeal to chance by reference to Scripture, urging that <QUOTE>by lot it was determined which of the goats should be offered to Aaron; by lot the land of Canaan was divided; by lot Saul was marked out for the kingdom; by lot Jonah was found to be the cause of the tempest; by lot the apostles filled up the vacant place of Judas.</QUOTE> But <QUOTE>the devil can quote Scripture for his purpose.</QUOTE> 
<P>In the same year (<datestruct value="1767"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>) the prize (or a prize) of <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure> fell to the lot of a tavern-keeper at Abingdon. We are told, in the journals of the time-- <QUOTE>The broker who went from town to carry him the news he complimented with <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>. All the bells in the place were set a-ringing. He called is neighbours, and promised to assist this <num value="1">one</num> with a capital sum, that <num value="1">one</num> with another. He gave away plenty of liquor, and vowed to lend a poor cobbler money to buy leather to stock his stall so full that he should not be able to get into it to work; and, lastly, he promised to buy a new coach for the coachman who brought him down the ticket, and to give a set of as good horses as could be bought for money.</QUOTE> 
<P>The theory of <QUOTE>lucky numbers</QUOTE> attracted great attention in the days of lotteries.   When the drawing took place, papers inscribed with as many different numbers as there were shares, or tickets, were placed in a hollow wheel; <num value="1">one</num> of these was drawn out, usually by a Bluecoat boy, and the number was audibly announced. Another Bluecoat boy then drew out of another wheel a paper, representing either a <QUOTE>blank</QUOTE> or a prize for a certain sum of money, and the purchaser of that particular number got nothing or gained a prize accordingly. With a view to getting lucky numbers, <num value="1">one</num> man would select his own age, or the age of his wife; another would select the date of the year, a <num value="3">third</num> a row of odd or of even numbers. Some, in their excitement, dreamt of numbers, and purchased tickets in harmony with their dreams. There is an amusing paper in the <title>Spectator</title> (No. <num value="191">191</num>, <datestruct VALUE="1711-10-9"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=9>9</day>, <year reg=1711>1711</year></datestruct>) in which the subject of lucky numbers is dealt with in a strain of pleasant banter. It tells of <num value="1">one</num> man who selected <num value="171">171</num> , because it was the year of our Lord; of another who sought for <num value="134">134</num>, because it constituted the minority on a celebrated bill in the House of Commons; and of a <num value="3">third</num> who selected the number of the beast, <num value="666">666</num>, on the ground that wicked beings were often lucky. In <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct> a lady bought No. <num value="17090">17090</num>, because it was the nearest <hi rend=italics>in sound</hi> to <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, which had been already sold to some other applicant. A story is told of a tradesman who, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, bought <num value="4">four</num> tickets consecutive in number. He thought it foolish to have them so close together, and took <num value="1">one</num> back to the office to be exchanged. The <num value="1">one</num> thus taken back turned up a <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure> prize! 
<P>The last <QUOTE>State lottery</QUOTE> was drawn in England on the <datestruct VALUE="1826-10-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>, at Cooper's Hall, Basinghall Street. Public suspicion had, however, by this time been aroused, and though such numbers turned out to see the last of a long series of legalised swindles, as to inconveniently crowd the hall, the lottery-office keepers could not dispose of all the tickets. The abolition of lotteries deprived the Government of a revenue equal to <measure value="250000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="250000">250,000</num></measure> or <measure value="300000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300000">300,000</num></measure> per annum. 
<P>In Holborn was born the once popular lecturer and poet, George Alexander Stevens, <QUOTE>a man,</QUOTE> says the late Mr. J. H. Jesse, <QUOTE>whose misfortunes were only equal to his misconduct-at <num value="1">one</num> time the idol of a Bacchanalian club, and at another the inmate of a gaol; at <num value="1">one</num> time writing a <pb id="P.539" n="539"> drinkingsong, and at another a religious poem.   Stevens is now, perhaps, best remembered from his  <Q>Lectures on Heads,</Q>  a medley of wit and nonsense to which no other person but himself could have given the proper effect.   The lecture was originally designed for Shuter, who entirely failed in the performance. Stevens, however, no sooner attempted the task himself than it became instantly popular.</QUOTE> 
<P>At the commencement of his career Stevens attempted the stage, a line of life which he soon abandoned.   As an actor his merit was below mediocrity... As a humorous writer he acquired considerable fame, but his life being neither regulated by the rules of virtue nor of prudence, his health was soon impaired, his finances were often at a low ebb, and his person was not unfrequently in durance. His pecuniary position,   however, was much improved by his happily conceived lecture, by means of which he soon amassed  a large sum of money. After delivering it in England and Scotland,   with extraordinary     approbation, he visited America, and was well received in all the principal towns. In fact, in the course of a few years he became worth about <num value="10000">10,000</num>; but the greater part of this sum had melted from his hands before his death.   He died   on the <datestruct VALUE="1784-09-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct>, his mind having for some time previous been in a state of hopeless idiotic ruin. 
<P>Stevens is the <num value="1">first</num> instance that can be produced of <num value="1">one</num> man, single-handed, keeping   an audience amused for the space of <num value="4">four</num> hours. As   he was the inventor of this species of entertainment, it may naturally be inquired by what means it was suggested to him.   The <num value="1">first</num> idea of his lecture, it is said, was got at a village, where he was manager of a theatrical company.   He met there with a country mechanic, who described the members of the corporation with great force and humour. Upon this idea Stevens improved and was assisted in making the heads by his friend, who little imagined what a source of profit he had established. 
<P>Gerarde, the herbalist, had a large physic-garden in Holborn. The site is uncertain, but we may as well notice it here. He dates his <title>Herbal</title>
 <QUOTE>From my house in London, within the suburbs of London, this <datestruct VALUE="1597-12-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1597">1597</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> He mentions in his famous work many rare plants which grew well in the garden behind his house. 
<P>Of his botanic garden in Holborn, says Chalmers, <QUOTE>Gerard published a catalogue in <datestruct value="1596--"><year reg="1596">1596</year></datestruct> and again in <datestruct value="1599--"><year reg="1599">1599</year></datestruct>. Of this work scarcely an impression is known to exist, except <num value="1">one</num> in the British Museum, which proved of great use in preparing the <foreign lang=la>Hortus Kewensis</foreign> of Mr. Aiton, as serving to as certain the time when many old plants were <num value="1">first</num> cultivated. It contains, according to Dr. Pulteney, <num value="1033">1,033</num> species, or at least supposed such, though many   doubtless, were varieties; and there is an attestation of Lobel subjoined, vouching for his having seen nearly all of the growing and flowering. This was <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest   botanic gardens in Europe.</QUOTE> 
<P>This last statement of Chalmers' is a little of an exaggeration. The fact is, there was a botanic garden in England, at Syon House, the seat of the Duke of Somerset, as early as the beginning of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century. It was under the superintendence of Dr. Turner, whom Dr. Pulteney considers as the father of English botany. A great deal of interest seems to have been taken in botany during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and many new plants were brought into the country. Gerarde mentions Nicholas Lete, a merchant in London, <QUOTE>greatly in love with rare and   fair flowers,   for which he doth carefully send into Syria, having a servant there at Aleppo, and in many other countries, for which myself and the whole land are much bound unto him.</QUOTE> The same author also gives due   honour to Sir Walter Raleigh;   to Lord Edward   Zouch, who, assisted by the celebrated Lobel, brought plants, and seeds from Constantinople; and to Lord Hunsdon, Lord High Chamberlain of England, who, he says, <QUOTE>is worthy of triple honour for his care in getting, as also for his care in keeping, such rare and curious things from the farthest parts of the world.</QUOTE> 
<P>Gerarde was born at Nantwich,         in Cheshire, in <datestruct value="1545--"><year reg="1545">1545</year></datestruct>.   He practised surgery in London, and rose to eminence in that profession. After the publication   of his <title>Herbal,</title> he lived   for about <num value="10">ten</num> years, his death taking place in <datestruct value="1607--"><year reg="1607">1607</year></datestruct>.   Many errors have been   pointed out in Gerrde's work, but he had the great merit of   practical knowledge of plants,   with unbounded zeal and indefatigable perseverance. He contributed greatly to forward the knowledge of plants in England, and his name will be remembered by botanists with esteem, when the utility of his <title>Herbal</title> is superseded. <QUOTE>He was patronised,</QUOTE> says Pennant, <QUOTE>by several of the <num value="1">first</num> characters of the time.   During <num value="20">twenty</num> years he   superintended the garden of the great statesman, Lord Burleigh; on his death, he found in Sir Walter Raleigh another patron; and the same in Lord Edward Zouch and Lord Hunsdon, Lord High Treasurer of England. All of those noblemen were much smitten with the useful and agreeable study of botany.</QUOTE> 
<P>Many districts of London have in past times had the good fortune to be haunted by characters of an original type, and a most interesting volume <pb id="P.540" n="540"> might be compiled of these metropolitan oddities. At present we shall notice <num value="1">one</num> who used to frequent the region of Holborn, and who has been taken notice of by <QUOTE>Aleph,</QUOTE> in his <title>London Scenes and London People.</title>   This was Peter Stokes, known as <QUOTE>the Flying Pieman of Holborn Hill.</QUOTE> He is thus described, dressed in all the finery of an oldfashioned costume, by Mr. Harvey, writing in <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct> :-- <QUOTE>When I was a youngster, the steep roadway from   Hatton Garden to Fleet Market was highly attractive to me on account of the  <Q> Flying Pieman,</Q>  though he did not vend pies, but a kind of baked plum-pudding, which he offered smoking hot. He was a slim, active, middle-sized man, about <num value="40">forty</num> years old. He always wore a black suit, scrupulously brushed, dress-coat and vest, knee-breeches, stout black silk stockings, and shoes with steel buckles, then rather fashionable. His shirt, remarkably well got up, had a wide frill, surmounted by a spotless white cravat. He never wore either hat or cap; his hair, cropped very close, was plentifully powdered, and he was decorated with a delicate lawn apron, which hardly reached to his knees. In his right hand he held a small circular 
<FIGURE id="Fig.540" n="2000.07.0193"><HEAD>Old Houses In Holborn Near Middle Row.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 tray or board, just large enough to receive an appetite-provoking pudding, about <num value="3">three</num> inches thick. This was divided into <num value="12">twelve</num> slices, which he sold at a penny a slice. A broad blunt spatula, brilliantly bright, which he carried in his left hand, enabled him to dispense his sweets without ever touching them.   His countenance was open and agreeable, expressive of intellect and moral excellence.</QUOTE> 
<P>And about this man, engaged in such a humble trade, shone the light of a somewhat romantic history. He was by profession a painter, and, it was believed, possessed considerable talent. When he was a very young man he married, <QUOTE>all for love.</QUOTE> His practice as an artist did not keep pace with the growing wants of a small family, and at last, with an eccentricity which, in the circumstances, may be pardoned, he determined to begin a street-trade on Holborn Hill, and conducted this business for many a day. From <num value="12">twelve</num> to <num value="4">four</num> o'clock he was to be seen shouting, <QUOTE>Buy, buy, buy!</QUOTE> as he moved to and fro, from Fetter Lane to Ely Place, thence to Thavies Inn or to Field Lane, Hatton Garden or Fleet Market, rapidly <pb id="P.541" n="541"> getting rid of his tempting wares. After <num value="4">four</num> o'clock he betook himself to genteel lodgings in Rathbone Place, where Stokes was himself again, resumed his palette and easel, and found sitters increase as his means made them less necessary, for the street business proved a money-making <num value="1">one</num>. 
<P>Peter Stokes' history recalls that of a remarkable hawker of savoury patties, who might be constantly seen in the streets of Paris, during the earlier years of Louis XVI. He was of higher origin than our London <QUOTE>Flying Pieman,</QUOTE> however, but reckless extravagance had reduced him to poverty while he was yet in the prime of life. His dress was fastidiously elegant, and while standing, basket in hand, on the steps of the Palais Royal, he wore round his neck the decoration of St. Croix. Sterne had seen him, and declares that his manners and address were those of a man of high rank. 
<P>Let us now speak about another character of this neighbourhood, namely, an old bellman of Holborn, and take the opportunity of saying a few words about bellmen in general. <QUOTE>In London, and probably in other English cities in the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century,</QUOTE> 
<FIGURE id="Fig.541" n="2000.07.0194"><HEAD>Bleeding Heart Yard.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 says Dr. Robert Chambers, <QUOTE>the bellman was the recognised term for what we would now call a night watchman, being derived from the handbell which the man carried in order to give alarm in case of fire. In the Luttrell Collection of Broadsides (British Museum) is <num value="1">one</num> dated <datestruct value="1683--"><year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>-<num value="4">4</num>, entitled, <title>A   Copy of Verses presented by Isaac Ragg, Bellman, to his Masters and Mistresses of Holbourn Division, in the Parish of St. Giles-in-the- Fields.</title> It is headed by a woodcut representing Isaac   in   professional accoutrements--a pointed pole in the left hand, and in the right a bell, while his lantern hangs from his jacket in front.  Below is a series of verses on St. Andrew's Day, King Charles the <num value="1">First</num>'s birthday, St. Thomas's Day, Christmas Day, St. John's Day, Childermas Day, New Year's Day, the <datestruct value="01-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, &amp;c., all of them being very proper, and very insufferable. The   prologue indeed is the only specimen worth giving, being the expression of Mr. Ragg's official duty.   It runs as follows:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Time, master, calls your bellman to his task, 
<L>To see your doors and windows all are fast, 
<L>And that no villany or foul crime be done 
<L>To you or yours in absence of the sun. <pb id="P.542" n="542">

<L>If any base lurker I do meet,

<L>And so God bless you, and give rest to all.</QUOTE></QUOTE>
 
<P><num value="1">One</num>   of our   Holborn   bellman's   professional brethren, Thomas Law, issued a similar but unadorned   broadside in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, which   has had   the good fortune to be preserved for our enlightenment.   In it he greets his masters of <QUOTE>St. Giles, Cripplegate, within the Freedom,</QUOTE> in no less than <num value="23">twenty-three</num> dull stanzas, of which the last may be given here:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>No sooner hath St. Andrew crowned November,

<L>He brings the winter month Newcastle way: 
<L>For comfort here of poor distressed souls 
<L><hi rend=italics>Would he had with him brought a fleet of coals.</hi></QUOTE>
 
<P>At a fixed season of the year--most often, no doubt, Christmas--it seems to have been customary for the bellman to distribute copies of his broadside through the district of which he had the charge, expecting his masters to favour him in return with some small gratuity.     The   execrable character which usually belonged to these rhymed productions is shown by the contempt with which the wits used to speak of <QUOTE>bellman's verses.</QUOTE> 
<P>Robert Herrick has a little poem   in which he wishes good luck   to his friends in the form   of the nightly addresses of the bellman.     Like all Herrick's productions, it is daintily musical. With its good wishes applied to the reader, we shall leave him for the present, and conclude this chapter:--

<P>In   speaking of the tributary streams of human activity which flow into Holborn from the north, we shall begin a little to the east of Ely Place, and mention <num value="1">one</num> which has lately been improved out of existence, namely, Field Lane. Field Lane, extending from the foot of Holborn Hill northward, and in this way lying parallel with Fleet Ditch, used to be an infamous haunt of the <QUOTE>dangerous classes.</QUOTE> Now, its site, entered off Charterhouse Street, may be visited by the inquiring stranger with somewhat of a feeling of disappointment that respectability is not half so picturesque as its opposite. In <datestruct value="1837--"><year reg="1837">1837</year></datestruct>, Field Lane was vividly sketched by Charles Dickens, in his <QUOTE>Oliver Twist.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Near to the spot,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>on which Snow Hill and Holborn meet, there opens, upon the right hand as you come out of the City, a narrow and dismal alley, leading to Saffron Hill. In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of pocket-handkerchiefs of all sizes and patterns, for here reside the traders who purchase them from pickpockets.   Hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting from the door-posts, and the shelves within are piled with them. Confined as the limits of Field Lane are, it has its barber, its coffee-shop, its beer-shop, and its fried fish warehouse. It is a commercial colony of itself-the emporium of petty larceny, visited at early morning and setting--in of dusk by silent merchants, who traffic in dark back parlours and go as strangely as they come.   Here the clothes-man, the shoevamper, and the rag-merchant, display their goods as sign-boards to the petty thief, and stores of old iron and bones, and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen-stuff and linen, rust and rot in the grimy cellars.</QUOTE> 
<P>Northward from   Field Lane ran Saffron Hill, which once formed a part of the pleasant gardens of Ely Place, and derived its name from the crops of saffron which it bore. But the saffron disappeared, and in time there grew up a squalid neighbourhood, swarming with poor people and thieves.

It had various cunning contrivances for enabling its inmates to escape from the pursuit of justice.

<P>Moving westward, we come to <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.543.1">Hatton Garden</LEMMA>so called after the Sir Christopher Hatton we have already met with as Lord Chancellor in Elizabeth's reign, and after <QUOTE>Christopher Hatton, his godson, son of John Hatton, cousin and heir-male of the celebrated Sir Christopher Hatton, created Baron Hatton of Kirby, in the county of Northampton, <datestruct VALUE="1643-07-29"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=29>29th</day>, <year reg=1643>1643</year></datestruct>, and died <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> 
<P>Strype describes Hatton Garden as <QUOTE>a very large place, containing several streets-viz., Hatton Street, Charles Street, Cross Street, and Kirby Street, all which large tract of ground was a garden, and belonged to Hatton House, now pulled down, and built into houses.</QUOTE>

<P>In Dennis's <title>Letters,</title> <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, we come upon a passage relating to an almost-forgotten poet and playwright who, on matrimonial thoughts intent, once haunted this locality. <QUOTE>Mr. Wycherly visited her [the Countess of Drogheda] daily at her lodgings, while she stayed at Tunbridge, and after she went to London, at her lodgings' in Hatton Garden, where, in a little time, he got her consent to marry her.</QUOTE> This is part of a romantic story told in Cibber's <title>Lives of the Poets,</title> in repeating which we must begin by informing the reader that <num value="1">one</num> of Wycherly's most successful plays was entitled <title>The Plain Dealer</title>.   The writer went down to Tunbridge, to take either the benefit of the waters or the diversions of the place, and when walking <num value="1">one</num> day upon the Wells Walk with his friend Mr. Fairbeard, of Gray's Inn, just as he came up to the bookseller's, the Countess of Drogheda, a young widow, rich and beautiful, came to the bookseller and inquired for <title>The Plain Dealer</title>. <QUOTE>Madam,</QUOTE> says Mr. Fairbeard, <QUOTE>since you are for <title>The Plain Dealer</title>, there he is for you,</QUOTE> pushing Mr. Wycherley towards her. <QUOTE>Yes,</QUOTE> says Mr. Wycherley, <QUOTE>this lady can bear plain dealing, for she appears to be so accomplished, that what would be a compliment to others, when said to her would be plain dealing.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>No, truly, sir,</QUOTE> said the lady; <QUOTE>I am not without my faults, like the rest of my sex; and yet, notwithstanding all my faults, I love plain dealing, and never am more fond of it than when it tells me of a fault.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Then, madam,</QUOTE> says Mr. Fairbeard, <QUOTE>you and  <Q>The Plain Dealer</Q>  seem designed by Heaven for each other.</QUOTE> 
<P>The upshot of the affair was that Mr. Wycherley accompanied the countess on her walks, waited on her home, visited her daily at her lodgings, followed her to town, and, as we have seen, at Hatton Garden brought his wooing to a successful close. 
<P>A gallant beginning should have a good ending. But it was not so here: the lady proved unreasonably jealous, and led the poor poet a sad life. Even from a pecuniary point of view he made a bad bargain of his marriage, for after her death her bequest to him was disputed at law, and, drowned in debt, he was immured in a gaol for <num value="7">seven</num> years. 
<P>The celebrated physician, Dr. George Bate, who attended Oliver Cromwell in his last illness, died in Hatton Garden in <datestruct value="1668--"><year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>. He was born in <datestruct value="1608--"><year reg="1608">1608</year></datestruct> at Maid's Morton, near Buckingham. He rose to great eminence in his profession, and when King Charles kept his court at Oxford, was his principal physician there. When the king's affairs declined, he removed to London, and adapted himself so well to the changed times that he became chief physician to the Lord Protector, whom he is said to have highly flattered. Upon the restoration he got into favour again with the royal party, and was made principal physician to Charles II., and Fellow of the Royal Society. This, we are told, was owing to a report, raised on very slender foundation, and asserted only by his friends, that he gave Cromwell a dose of poison which hastened his death. 
<P>Charles Street, which intersects Hatton Garden, is interesting as that in which Joseph Strutt, the antiquarian writer, died, on the <datestruct VALUE="1802-10-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>. We have already given some particulars regarding him, when speaking of St. Andrew's Churchyard, in which he was buried. There is a publichouse of the name of the <QUOTE>Bleeding Heart</QUOTE> in this street. This is a sign dating from before the Reformation.   It is the emblematical representa- <pb id="P.544" n="544"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.544.1">Old Houses-Leather Lane</LEMMA></NOTE>
 tion of the <num value="5">five</num> sorrowful mysteries of the Rosaryviz, the heart of the Holy Virgin pierced with <num value="5">five</num> swords. Bleeding Heart Yard, adjoining the publichouse in Charles Street, is immortalised by Charles Dickens in <title>Little Dorrit.</title>
 
<P>Bleeding Heart Yard, says the novelist, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>was a place much changed in feature and fortune, yet with some relish of ancient greatness about it. <num value="2">Two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> mighty stacks of chimneys, and a few large dark rooms, which had escaped being walled and subdivided out of the recognition of their old proportions, gave the yard a character.   It was inhabited by poor people, who set up their rest among its faded glories as Arabs of the desert pitch their tents among the fallen stones of the Pyramids; but there was a family sentimental feeling prevalent in the yard, that it had a character. 
<P>The opinion of the Yard was divided respecting the derivation of its name.   The more practical of its inmates abided by the tradition of a murder; the gentler and more imaginative inhabitants, including the whole of the tender sex, were loyal to the legend of a young lady of former time closely imprisoned in her chamber by a cruel father for remaining true to her own true love, and refusing to marry the suitor he chose for her. The legend related how that the young lady used to be seen up at her window, behind the bars, murmuring a love-lorn song, of which the burden was  <Q>Bleeding Heart, Bleeding Heart, bleeding away,</Q>  until she died.   It was objected by the murderous party that this refrain was notoriously the invention of a tambour-worker, a spinster, and romantic, still lodging in the yard. But forasmuch as all favourite legends must be associated with the affections, and as many more people fall in love than commit murder-which, it may be hoped, howsoever bad we are, will continue until the end of the world to be the dispensation under which we livethe Bleeding-Heart, Bleeding-Heart, bleeding-away story, carried the day by a large majority. Neither party would listen to the antiquaries, who delivered learned lectures in the neighbourhood showing the bleeding heart to have been the heraldic cognisance of the old family to whom the property once belonged.   And considering that the hour-glass they turned from year to year was filled with the earthiest and coarsest sand, the Bleeding Heart Yarders had reason enough for objecting to be despoiled of the <num value="1">one</num> little golden grain of poetry that sparkled in it.</QUOTE>
 
<P>The next Holborn tributary to be mentioned is 
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.544.2">Leather Lane</LEMMA>, which runs from Holborn to Liquorpond Street. <QUOTE>Then, higher up,</QUOTE> says Stow, <QUOTE>is Lither Lane, turning also to the field, lately replenished with houses built, and so to the bar.</QUOTE> Strype, describing it in his own time, says, <QUOTE>The east side of this lane is best built, having all brick houses. <gap> In this lane is  <Q> White Heart Inn,</Q>   <Q>Nag's Head Inn,</Q>  and  <Q>King's Head Inn </Q> all indifferent.</QUOTE> 
<P>Following Leather Lane northwards, we come to Eyre Street. It is too far removed from our main thoroughfare to be mentioned without an excuse. We make the excuse, however, for the sake of the eminent artist who breathed his last here. Here, in <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct>,   died George Morland, the celebrated painter. It was in a sponging-house. He had been taken in execution by a publican, for a debt amounting, with costs, to about <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure>, and was conveyed to this place in Eyre Street Hill, overwhelmed with misfortune, debt, and neglect; every evil being aggravated by the bitterness of self-reproach. 
<P> <QUOTE>In   this state of desperation,</QUOTE> says his biographer, <QUOTE>he drank great quantities of spirits, and more than once attempted to resume the exercise of those talents which hitherto had never failed to procure him the means of relief; but the period was arrived when even that resource failed him, for the next morning he dropped off his chair in a fit, while sketching a bank and a tree in a drawing. This proved to be the commencement of a brain fever; after which he never spoke intelligibly, but remained <num value="8">eight</num> days delirious and convulsed, in a state of utter mental and bodily debility, and expired the <datestruct VALUE="1804-10-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct>, in the fortysecond year of his age.</QUOTE> 
<P>With regard to the works of this unfortunate and dissipated artist, justly entitled to the appellation of <QUOTE>the English Teniers,</QUOTE> it is certain that they will be esteemed so long as any taste for art remains in the kingdom. Even his ordinary productions will give pleasure to all who are charmed with an accurate representation of nature. His command over the implements of his profession was very great, so great, indeed, that the use of them became to him a <num value="2">second</num> nature.   Thus pictures flowed from his pencil with the most astonishing rapidity, and without that patience and industry which works even of inferior merit so often require. While he was in the prime of life, with a constitution unimpaired, his chief efforts were in picturesque landscape, in which every circumstance was represented with the utmost accuracy and spirit; and it is such subjects as these, to which he devoted his attention for about <num value="7">seven</num> years, that have secured him an imperishable reputation. In such pieces, the figures he introduced were of the lowest order, but they retained a consistency appropriate to the surroundings. When, from increasing depravity of manners, <pb id="P.545" n="545"> he left the green woodside, and became the constant inmate of the alehouse, his subjects were of a meaner cast, for he only painted what he saw. <QUOTE>In portraying drovers, stage-coachmen, postilions, and labourers of all descriptions,</QUOTE> says Mr. F. W. Blagdon, <QUOTE>he shone in full glory; and his favourite animals, the ass, the sheep, and the hog, were represented with an accuracy peculiar to himself, though with a deficiency of that correctness which is requisite to form   a <hi rend=italics>finished</hi> picture; because a few strokes will represent a <hi rend=italics>picturesque</hi> character, while beauty of form can only arise from repeated comparisons with and amendments from viewing the object, delineated.   Morland, however, made his sketches at once, and finished them from recollection, and hence his pictures afford the finest specimens of Nature in her roughest state, but nothing that in point of form can be called beautiful: it has even been said, though with what truth I cannot pretend to determine, that he was never able to draw a beautiful horse, like those delineated by Stubbs or Gilpin.   But it will never be disputed that as a painter of old, rugged, and working cattle, together with all the localities of a farm-yard or stable, his equal does not, nor ever did exist.</QUOTE> 
<P>He was much given to mischievous amusement, and was fond of making a disturbance in the night, and alarming his neighbours. A frolic of this sort had nearly cost him dear :--Whilst living at Lambeth, he, with the assistance of a drunken companion, actually broke open   his own house, and enjoyed beyond description the alarm it occasioned his family, some relations being at the time with him on a visit. He was at length taken up by some persons who witnessed the transaction, when it turned out that he had apprised the watchman of his intentions, and even bribed him to assist. 
<P>Brooke Street, Holborn, is familiar enough to the general public as leading to the church of St. Alban's--a church which, for sundry reasons, has been of late somewhat prominently before the world.   Few, however, of those who pass up and down its well-trodden pavement are aware of the interesting memories which belong to the neighbourhood. 
<P>In a lodging in Brooke Street-most probably No. <num value="39">39</num>-on the <datestruct VALUE="1770-08-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, the marvellous boy, Chatterton, put an end to his life by swallowing arsenic in water. The house was then No. <num value="4">4</num>, and in the occupation of a Mrs. Angel, a sackmaker.   The poet was <num value="17">seventeen</num> years and <num value="9">nine</num> months old at the time of his death. 
<P>With Chatterton's career in Bristol--where he was born on the <datestruct VALUE="1752-11-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1752">1752</year></datestruct>--with his Rowley forgeries, with his communications with   Horace Walpole, and the discovery of their spurious nature, we shall not meddle at present. But we may profitably spend a short time here in speaking of his life from the time of his arrival in the great metropolis till his sad end. Dissatisfied with Bristol, and feeling certain that in London his talent would be duly honoured, he came here about the end of <datestruct VALUE="1770-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>. To his correspondents he boasted that he had had <num value="3">three</num> distinct resources to trust to: <num value="1">one</num> was to write, another was to turn Methodist parson, and the last was to shoot himself. The last resource, unfortunately, is in everybody's power. A friendly group saw him start; he arrived in town, and settled <num value="1">first</num> in lodgings in Shoreditch, but afterwards removed to the above-mentioned address in Brooke Street. For the space of <num value="4">four</num> months he struggled against fate, but the records we have of his doings are obscure and untrustworthy. It is true he sent flaming accounts to friends in Bristol of his rising importance; that he found money to purchase   and transmit to his mother and sister useless articles of finery; and also that he did his best to form profitable connections: it may well be doubted, however, whether any large amount of success or remuneration rewarded his extraordinary efforts. 
<P>His <num value="1">first</num> literary attempts were of a political kind, and he contrived to write on both sides of the question . He   also produced numerous articles of a miscellaneous kind in prose and verse.   At <num value="1">one</num> time he seemed in a fair way for fortune, for Lord Mayor Beckford encouraged him, and accepted of the dedication of an essay; but before the essay could appear, Beckford died. He made a profit, however, on the Lord Mayor's death, and wrote down on the back of a MS., <QUOTE>I am glad he is dead, by <measure value="3l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3">3</num></measure> <measure value="13s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="13">13</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure></QUOTE> Wilkes also took notice of him, but, likely enough, he was more ready with his praise than with his money. 
<P>At length, work failed the unfortunate poet, and he began to starve; his literary pursuits were abandoned, and he projected to go out to Africa as a naval surgeon's mate.   He had picked up some knowledge of surgery from Mr. Barrett, the historian of Bristol, and now requested that gentleman's recommendation; but he thought proper to refuse. The short remainder of his days was spent in a conflict between pride and poverty. 
<P> <QUOTE>Mrs. Angel,</QUOTE> says Dix, in his <title>Life of Chatterton,</title> <QUOTE>stated that for <num value="2">two</num> days, when he did not absent himself from his room, he went without sustenance of any kind.. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, when she knew him to be in want of food, she begged he would take a little dinner with her; he was offended at the invitation, and assured her he was not <pb id="P.546" n="546"> hungry.   Mr. Cross also, an apothecary in Brooke Street, gave evidence that he repeatedly pressed Chatterton to dine or sup with him, and when, with great difficulty, he was <num value="1">one</num> evening prevailed on to partake of a barrel of oysters, he was observed to eat most voraciously.</QUOTE> 
<P>When he was found lying on his bed, stiff and cold, on the <datestruct value="08-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, there were remains of arsenic between his teeth. Previous to committing suicide, he seems to have destroyed all his manuscripts; for when his room was broken open, it was found littered with little scraps of paper. 
<P>He was interred, after the inquest, in a pauper's 
<FIGURE id="Fig.546" n="2000.07.0195"><HEAD>Leather Lane.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 burial-ground, as mentioned by us already (Vol. I., p. <num value="134">134</num>); but there is a story, also related by us elsewhere, to which some credit may perhaps be given, that his body was removed to Bristol, and secretly stowed away in the churchyard of St. Mary Redcliffe. <QUOTE>There can be no more decisive proof,</QUOTE> says Mr. Chalmers, <QUOTE>of the little regard he attracted in London, than the secrecy and silence which accompanied his death. This event, though so extraordinary--for young suicides are surely not common --is not even mentioned in any shape in the <title>Gentleman's Magazine</title>, the <title>Annual Register, St. James's</title>
 or <title>London Chronicles</title>, nor in any of the respectable <pb id="P.547" n="547"> publications of the day.</QUOTE> And so perished in destitution, obscurity, and despair, <num value="1">one</num> who, under happier circumstances, might have ranked among the <num value="1">first</num> of his generation. 
<P>Of the house in which the poet terminated his strange career, Mr. Hotten, in his <title>Adversaria,</title>
 gives some interesting reminiscences. At the date of Mr. Hotten's writing, the house was occupied by a plumber, of the name of Jefford. <QUOTE>We know,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>from the account of Sir Herbert Croft, that Chatterton occupied the garret--a room looking out into the street, as the only garret in this house does. I remember this room very well as it was <num value="26">twenty-six</num> years ago, soon after which the occupier made some alterations in it.   It must then have been substantially in the same condition 
<FIGURE id="Fig.547" n="2000.07.0196"><HEAD>Chatterton's House In Brooke Street.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 as in <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>; for the walls were old and dilapidated, and the flooring decayed.      It was a square and rather large room for an attic. It had <num value="2">two</num> windows in it-lattice windows, or casements-built in a style which I think is called  <Q>Dormer.</Q>  Outside ran the gutter, with a low parapet wall, over which you could look into the street below. The roof was very low-so low that I, who am not a tall man, could hardly stand upright in it with my hat on; and it had a very long slope, extending from the middle of the room down to the windows. It is a curious fact that, in the well-known picture (the  <Q>Death of Chatterton,</Q>  by Wallis) exhibited at Manchester, St. Paul's is visible through the window; I say a singular fact, because, although this is strictly in accordance with the truth, as now known, the <pb id="P.548" n="548"> story previously believed was that the house was opposite, where no room looking into the street could have commanded a view of St. Paul's. This, however, could only have been a lucky accident of the painter's.   About the time I have mentioned, the tenant divided the garret into <num value="2">two</num> with a partition, carried the roof up, making it horizontal, and made some other alterations which have gone far to destroy the identity of the room. It is a singular coincidence, seeing the connection between the names of Walpole and Chatterton, that my friend, Mrs. Jefford, the wife of the now occupier, who has resided there more than <num value="20">twenty</num> years, was for some years in the service of Horace Walpole, afterwards Lord Orford.   She is a very old lady, and remembers Lord Orford well, having entered his family as a girl, and continued in it till he died, near the end of the last century.</QUOTE> 
<P>The--epitaph adopted for Chatterton's monument in Bristol was <num value="1">one</num> written by himself; and with it we leave him, to pass on to a happier subject:--

<P>Philip Yorke, the great <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.548.1">Lord Chancellor Hardwicke</LEMMA> (born <datestruct value="1690--"><year reg="1690">1690</year></datestruct>), was articled, without a fee, it is said, to an attorney named Salkeld, in Brooke Street.   It was rather against the wish of his mother, who was a rigid Presbyterian.

Greek he hardly affected to be acquainted with.</QUOTE> 
<P>By these means he gained the entire good-will and esteem of his master, who, observing in him abilities and application that prognosticated his future eminence, entered him as a student in the Temple, and suffered him   to dine in the Hall during the terms.   But his mistress, a notable woman, thinking she might take some liberties with a <hi rend=italics>gratis clerk</hi>, used frequently to send him from his business on family errands, and to fetch in little necessaries from Covent Garden and other markets. This, when he became a favourite with his master, and entrusted with his business and cash, he thought an indignity, and got rid of it by a stratagem   which prevented complaints or expostulation. In his accounts with his master there frequently occurred <QUOTE rend=italic>Coach hire for roots of celery and turnips from   Covent Garden, and a barrel of oysters from   the fishmonger's, &.c.</QUOTE>  This Mr. Salkeld observed, and urging on his wife the impropriety and ill housewifery of such a practice, put an end to it. 
<P>There were at that time in Mr. Salkeld's office several young gentlemen of good family and connections, who had been sent there to be initiated in the practical part of the law. With these Philip Yorke, though an articled clerk, associated on terms of perfect equality, and they had the merit of discovering and encouraging his good qualities. 
<P> <QUOTE>But the young man,</QUOTE> continues Lord Campbell, <QUOTE>still had to struggle with many difficulties, and he would probably have been obliged, from penury, to go upon the roll of attorneys, rising only to be clerk to the magistrates at petty sessions, or, perhaps, to the dignity of town clerk of Dover, had it not been for his accidental introduction to Lord Chief Justice Parker, which was the foundation of all his prosperity and greatness. This distinguished judge had a high opinion of Mr. Salkeld, who was respected by all ranks of the profession, and asked him <num value="1">one</num> day if he could tell him of a decent and intelligent person who might assist as a sort of lawtutor for his sons--to assist and direct them in their professional studies.   The attorney eagerly recommended his clerk, Philip Yorke, who was immediately retained in that capacity, and, giving the highest satisfaction by his assiduity and his <pb id="P.549" n="549"> obliging manners, gained the warm friendship of the sons, and the weighty, persevering, and unscrupulous patronage of the father.</QUOTE> In Brooke Street 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><num value="3">Three</num> years he sat his smoky room in, Pens, paper, ink, and pounce consumin&lsquo;;</QUOTE>
 but he now bade adieu to that legal haunt, and had a commodious chamber assigned him in Lincoln's Inn Fields. <QUOTE>Released from the drudgery, not only of going to Covent Garden Market, but of attending captions and serving process, he devoted himself with fresh vigour to the abstruse parts of the law, and to his more liberal studies. Farther, he took great pains to acquire the habit of correct composition in English-generally so much neglected by English lawyers that many of the most eminent of them will be found, in their written  <Q>opinions,</Q>  violating the rules of grammar, and, without the least remorse, construing their sentences in a slovenly manner for which a schoolboy would be whipped. The <title>Tatler</title> had done much to inspire a literary taste into all ranks.   This periodical had ceased, but being now succeeded by the <title>Spectator</title>, Philip Yorke gave his days and nights to the study of Addison.</QUOTE> And now we have started him fairly in the race for the Lord Chancellorship, the goal at which he arrived in <datestruct value="1736--"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct>. He held the office of Lord Chancellor for <num value="20">twenty</num> years. His reputation as a judge was very high; indeed, so great confidence was placed both in his uprightness and in his professional skill, that during the whole of his Chancellorship, riot <num value="1">one</num> of his decisions was set aside, and only <num value="3">three</num> were tried on appeal. 
<P>Greville Street, running off Brooke Street, as well as Brooke Street itself, derives its name from Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, <QUOTE>servant to Queen Elizabeth, counsellor to King James, and friend to Sir Philip Sidney.</QUOTE> Brooke House was subsequently known as Warwick House, and stood, according to Mr. Cunningham, where Greville Street now stands. 
<P>It was in Brooke House that, on the <datestruct VALUE="1628-09-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1628">1628</year></datestruct>, Lord Brooke met with his tragical fate. He had been attended for many years by <num value="1">one</num> Ralph Haywood, a gentleman by birth, who thought that the least his master could do for him would be to reward his long services by bequeathing him a handsome legacy. It fell out, however, that Lord Brooke not only omitted Haywood's name from his will, but unfortunately allowed him to become cognisant of the fact. Irritated at this, and, besides, at having been sharply reprimanded for some real or imaginary offence, Haywood determined to have his revenge. He entered Lord Brooke's chamber, had a violent dispute with him, and ended by stabbing him in the back.   The assassin, then retreated to his own apartment, locked himself in, and committed suicide, killing himself by the same weapon with which he had stabbed his master. Lord Brooke survived only a few days. 
<P>Lord Brooke was born at Beauchamp Court, in Warwickshire, in <datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct>, and was educated at Oxford. Upon his return to England, after a Continental tour to finish his education, he was introduced to the Court of Elizabeth by his uncle, Robert Greville. He speedily became a favourite with the Queen, though he did not fail to experience some of the capriciousness, as well as many of the delights, of royal favour. He and Sir Philip Sidney became fast friends, and when, in <datestruct value="1586--"><year reg="1586">1586</year></datestruct>, the latter unfortunately closed his earthly career, he left Lord Brooke (then simply Mr. Greville) <num value="1">one</num>-half of his books. The reign of James I. opened happily for him.   At the king's coronation he was made K.B., and an office which he held, in connection with the Council of the Court of Marches of Wales, was confirmed to him for life. In the <num value="2">second</num> year of James I., he obtained a grant of Warwick Castle. This seems to have gratified him exceedingly; and the castle being in a ruinous condition, he laid out <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure> in repairing it. He afterwards occupied the posts of Under-Treasurer and Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Lord of the King's Bedchamber. On the death of King James, he continued in the privy council of Charles I., in the beginning of whose reign he founded a history lecture in the University of Cambridge, and endowed it with a salary of <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> a year. He did not long survive this last act of generosity; for though he was a munificent patron of learning and learned men, he at last fell a victim to the extraordinary outrage, as we have seen, of a discontented domestic. 
<P>He was the author of several works; but it is for his generosity to more successful authors than himself that he is chiefly to be remembered. <QUOTE>He made Sir Philip Sidney, his dear friend,</QUOTE> says Chalmers, <QUOTE>the great exemplar of his life in everything; and Sidney being often celebrated as the patron of the Muses in general, so, we are told Lord Brooke desired to be known to posterity under no other character than that of Shakespeare's and Ben Jonson's master; Lord Chancellor Egerton and Bishop Overal's patron.   His lordship also obtained the office of Clarencieux-at-Arms for Mr. Camden, who very gratefully acknowledged it in his lifetime, and at his death left him a piece of plate in his will. He also raised John Speed from a mechanic to be an historiographer.</QUOTE> His kindness to Sir William Davenant must also be mentioned. <pb id="P.550" n="550"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.550.1">Carriage Repository</LEMMA></NOTE>
 He took a fancy to that poet when he was very young, and received him into his family, and it is quite likely that the plan of the earlier plays of Davenant was formed in Brooke House; they were published shortly after Lord Brooke's death. 
<P>Gray's Inn Lane is the last northern tributary we have to mention. It derives its name, as <num value="1">one</num> might naturally enough conclude, from the adjacent inn of court. <QUOTE>This lane,</QUOTE> says Stow, <QUOTE>is furnished with fair buildings, and many tenements on both the sides leading to the fields towards Highgate and Hampstead.</QUOTE> 
<P>To the novel-reader Gray's Inn Lane will be always interesting. Tom Jones entered the great metropolis by its narrow, dingy thoroughfare, on his way to put up at the <QUOTE>Bull and Gate,</QUOTE> in Holborn. Jones, as well as Partridge, his companion, says Fielding, <QUOTE>was an entire stranger in London; and as he happened to arrive <num value="1">first</num> in a quarter of the town the inhabitants of which have very little intercourse with the householders of Hanover or Grosvenor Square (for he entered through Gray's Inn Lane), so he rambled about some time before he could even find his way to those happy mansions where fortune segregates from the--vulgar those magnanimous heroes, the descendants of ancient Britons, Saxons, or Danes, whose ancestors, being born in better days, by sundry kinds of merit have entailed riches and honour on their posterity.</QUOTE> 
<P>It was there he hoped to find Sophia Western, but <QUOTE>after a successless inquiry, till the clock had struck <num value="11">eleven</num>, Jones at. length yielded to the advice of Partridge, and retreated to the  <Q>Bull and Gate,</Q>  in Holborn, that being the inn where he had <num value="1">first</num> alighted, and where he retired to enjoy that kind of repose which usually attends persons in his circumstances</QUOTE> --the unquiet sleep that lovers have. 
<P>We can picture to ourselves the excitement with which Fielding's hero and his companion <num value="1">first</num> rode down Gray's Inn Lane. They had, an hour or <num value="2">two</num> before, had an adventure with a highwayman, an adventure told by the novelist in his chapter on <QUOTE>What Happened to Mr. Jones on his Journey from St. Albans,</QUOTE> and which we shall repeat here for the benefit of those who, though perhaps on nodding acquaintance with the <QUOTE>Foundling,</QUOTE> have not yet had leisure to listen to all his long history. 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>They were got about <num value="2">two</num> miles beyond Barnet, and it was now the dusk of the evening, when a genteel-looking man, but upon a very shabby horse, rode up to Jones, and asked him whether he was going to London, to which Jones answered in the affirmative. The gentleman replied,  <Q>I shall be obliged to you, sir, if you will accept of my company; for it is very late, and I am a stranger to the road.</Q>  Jones readily complied with the request, and on they travelled together, holding that sort of discourse which is usual on such occasions. Of this, indeed, robbery was the principal topic; upon which subject the stranger expressed great apprehensions; but Jones declared he had very little to lose, and consequently as little to fear. Here Partridge could not forbear putting in his word.  <Q>Your honour,</Q>  said he,  <Q>may think it a little, but I am sure if I had a <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pound</measure> bank-note in my pocket as you have, I should be very sorry to lose it. But, for my part, I was never less afraid in my life; for we are <num value="4">four</num> of us<NOTE resp=Thornbury>the guide made the <num value="4">fourth</num> of the party</NOTE>and if we all stand by <num value="1">one</num> another, the best man in England can't rob us. Suppose he should have a pistol, he can kill but <num value="1">one</num> of us, and a man can die but once; that's my comfort--a man can die but once.</Q>  
<P>Besides the reliance on superior numbers-a kind of valour which hath raised a certain nation among the moderns to a high pitch of glory-there was another reason for the extraordinary courage which Partridge now discovered, for he had at present as much of that quality as was in the power of liquor to bestow. 
<P>Our company were now arrived within a mile of Highgate, when the stranger turned short upon Jones, and pulling out a pistol, demanded that little bank-note which Partridge had mentioned. 
<P>Jones was at <num value="1">first</num> somewhat shocked at this unexpected demand; however, he presently recollected himself, and told the highwayman all the money he had in his pocket was entirely at his service; and so saying, he pulled out upwards of <num value="3">three</num> guineas, and offered to deliver it, but the other answered, with an oath, that would not do. Jones answered, coolly, he was very sorry for it, and returned the money into his pocket. 
<P>The highwayman then threatened, if he did not deliver the bank-note that moment, he must shoot him; holding the pistol at the same time very near to his breast. Jones instantly caught hold of the fellow's hand, which trembled so that he could scarce hold the pistol in it, and turned the muzzle from him. A struggle then ensued, in which the former wrested the pistol from the hands of his antagonist, and both came from their horses on the ground together--the highwayman on his back, the victorious Jones upon him. 
<P>The poor fellow now began to implore mercy of the conqueror, for, to say the truth, he was in strength by no means a match for Jones.  <Q>Indeed, sir,</Q>  says he,  <Q>I could have no intention to shoot <pb id="P.551" n="551"> you, for you will find the pistol was not loaded. This is the <num value="1">first</num> robbery I ever attempted, and I have been driven by distress to this.</Q>  
<P>At this instant, about <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> yards distant, lay another person on the ground, roaring for mercy in a much louder voice: than the highwayman. This was no other than Partridge himself, who, endeavouring to make his escape from the engagement, had been thrown from his horse, and lay flat on his face, not daring to look up, and expecting every minute to be shot. 
<P>In this posture he lay till the guide, who was no otherwise concerned than for his horse, having secured the stumbling beast, came up to him, and told him his master had got the better of the highwayman. 
<P>Partridge leaped up at this news, and ran back to the place where Jones stood, with his sword drawn in his hand, to guard the poor fellow, which Partridge no sooner saw, than he cried out,  <Q>Kill the villain, sir! Run him through the body! Kill him, this instant!</Q>  
<P>Luckily, however, for the poor wretch, he had fallen into more merciful hands; for Jones, having examined the pistol, and found it to be really unloaded, began to believe all the man had told him before Partridge came up-namely, that he was a novice in the trade; and that he had been driven to it by the distress he had mentioned, the greatest, indeed, imaginable--that of <num value="5">five</num> hungry children, and a wife lying--in of the <num value="6">sixth</num>, in the utmost want and misery; the truth of all which the highwayman most violently asserted, and offered to convince Mr. Jones of, if he would take the trouble to go to his house, which was not above <num value="2">two</num> miles off, saying he desired no favour, but on condition of proving all he alleged. 
<P>Jones at <num value="1">first</num> pretended that he would take the fellow at his word, and go with him, declaring. that his fate should depend entirely on the truth of his story. Upon this the poor fellow immediately expressed so much alacrity, that Jones was perfectly satisfied with his veracity, and began now to entertain sentiments of compassion for him. He returned the fellow his empty pistol, advised him to think of honester means of relieving his distress, and gave him a couple of guineas for the immediate support of his wife and family, adding, he wished he had had more, for his sake, for the <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure> that had been mentioned was not his own.</QUOTE>
 
<P>They parted, and Jones and Partridge rode on towards London, conversing of highwaymen. Jones threw out some satirical jokes on his companion's cowardice; but Partridge gave expression to a new philosophy:-- <QUOTE>A <num value="1000">thousand</num> naked men,</QUOTE> said he, <QUOTE>are nothing to <num value="1">one</num> pistol; for though, it is true, it will kill but <num value="1">one</num> at a single discharge, yet who can tell but that <num value="1">one</num> may be himself?</QUOTE> 
<P>Among the famous residents in Gray's Inn Lane were Hampden and Pym. It was here that they held their consultations, when the matter of the ship-money was pleaded in the Star-Chamber. 
<P><num value="3">Three</num> poets are also to be mentioned in connection with the lane. The <num value="1">first</num> of these is James Shirley, the poet and dramatist. This once wellknown writer was educated at St. John's College, Oxford, and was destined for the Church. Archbishop Laud advised him against carrying out the design, the reason being, according to Shirley's biographer, that the archbishop, who was a rigid observer of the canons of the Church, had noticed that the future poet had a large mole on <num value="1">one</num> of his cheeks.   Notwithstanding this, however, Shirley eventually took orders,   and obtained a curacy near St. Albans. He would have been better to have remained as he was, for his religious opinions became unsettled, and leaving the Church of England, he soon went over to Rome. After trying to maintain himself by teaching, he made his way to London, took up his abode in Gray's Inn Lane, and became a writer for the stage. 
<P>Happily, he lived in a golden age for dramatic genius. Charles I. appreciated him, and invited him to court, and Queen Henrietta Maria conferred on him   an appointment in her household. But soon the Civil War broke out. The poet then bade adieu to wife and children, and accompanied the Duke of Newcastle in his campaigns. On the failure of the king's cause he returned to London, ruined and desponding. His patron had perished on the scaffold, and his occupation as a play- Wright was being denounced from every pulpit in the land. He did the most sensible thing possible in the circumstances--he resumed his occupation of schoolmaster.   His success was considerable; and he showed his attention to his profession by publishing several works on grammar. 
<P>After a time came the Restoration, and with it the revival of his plays, but it brought no long career of prosperity to the poet. His death was remarkable. His house, which was at that time in Fleet Street, was burned to the ground in the Great Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, and he was forced, with his wife, to retreat to the suburbs, where the fright and loss so affected them both, that they died within some hours of each other, and were buried in the same grave. 
<P>The <num value="2">second</num> poet to be noticed is John Ogilby, whom the late Mr. Jesse terms <QUOTE>unfortunate,</QUOTE> but whom   Mr. Chalmers characterises by the juster <pb id="P.552" n="552"> terms of <QUOTE>a very industrious adventurer in literary speculation,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>an enterprising and honest man.</QUOTE> He was in his youth bound apprentice to a dancing-master in Gray's Inn Lane. In this line of life he soon made money enough to purchase his discharge from his apprenticeship. His talents as a dancer led to his introduction at court; but unluckily, at a masque given by the Duke of Buckingham, in executing a caper, he fell, and so severely sprained <num value="1">one</num> of the sinews of his leg as to be incapacitated from such lively exhibitions for the future. He had, however, a resource still left for him, as he continued to teach dancing. After a time he became author by profession, and wrote, translated, and edited all the, rest of his days.   Towards the close of his career he was appointed cosmographer and geographic printer to Charles II. 
<P>The <num value="3">third</num> and last poet is the Rev. John Langhorne, known to every school-boy and girl for his lines <QUOTE>To a Redbreast,</QUOTE> beginning- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Little bird with bosom red, 
<L>Welcome to my humble shed.</QUOTE>
 His favourite haunt was the <QUOTE>Peacock,</QUOTE> in this lane, a house celebrated in the last century for its Burton ale. It is a pity that Langhorne was too fond of the pleasant beverage: over-indulgence in it is said to have hastened his end. Chalmers certainly suggests a lame excuse for his tippling habits--that he had twice lost his wife. Langhorne deserves remembrance, if for nothing else than the excellent translation of Plutarch's <title>Lives,</title> which he executed in company with his brother William, and which has become so universally popular. To judge from his writings, he was a man of an amiable disposition, a friend to religion and morality; and, though a wit, we never find him descending to grossness or indelicacy. He was born in <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, and died on the <datestruct VALUE="1779-04-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1779">1779</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Numerous indeed are the spots in Gray's Inn Lane about which some memory hovers, or concerning which some good anecdote might be unearthed.   Towards the close of the eighteenth century there was a public-house in this lane called the <QUOTE>Blue Lion;</QUOTE> but the lion being the work of an artist who had not given very deep study to the personal appearance of the monarch of beasts, the establishment was commonly spoken of by its humorous frequenters as the <QUOTE>Blue Cat.</QUOTE> It bore no good character. A Mr. Francis Head, in giving evidence, in <datestruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct>, before a Committee of the House of Commons, appointed to inquire into the state of education of the people of England and Wales, said, <QUOTE>I have seen the landlord of this place come into the long room with a lump of silver in his hand, which he had melted for the thieves, and paid them for it. There was no disguise about it; it was done openly.</QUOTE> 
<P>Walking up Gray's Inn Lane, the <num value="1">first</num> turning <num value="1">one</num> comes to on the right is Fox Court. There is nothing attractive about its outward appearance, but, like nearly every nook and corner of old London, it has its own story to tell. <QUOTE>In this wretched alley,</QUOTE> says Mr. Jesse, <QUOTE>the profligate Countess of Macclesfield was delivered of her illegitimate child, Richard Savage.   In  <Q>the Earl of Macclesfield's Case,</Q>  presented to the House of Lords, will be found some curious particulars respecting the <hi rend=italics>accouchement</hi> of the countess, and the birth of the future poet. From   this source it appears that Anne, Countess of Macclesfield, under the name of Madame Smith, was delivered of a male child in Fox Court, Holborn, by a Mrs. Wright, a midwife, on Saturday, the <datestruct VALUE="1697-01-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>, at <num value="6">six</num> o'clock in the morning; that the child was baptised on the Monday following, and registered by Mr. Burbridge, assistant curate of St. Andrew's, Holborn, as the son of John Smith; that it was christened, on Monday, the <datestruct value="02-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, in Fox Court, and that, from the privacy maintained on the occasion, it was supposed by Mr. Burbridge to be a  <Q>by-blow.</Q>    During her delivery, Lady Macclesfield wore a mask. By the entry of the birth in the parish register of St. Andrew's, it appears that the child's putative father, Lord Rivers, gave his son his own Christian name:  <Q><datestruct VALUE="1696-01--"><month reg="01">January</month> <year reg="1696">1696</year></datestruct>-<num value="7">7</num>, Richard, son of John Smith and Mary, in Fox Court, in Gray's Inn Lane, baptised the <num value="18">18th</num>.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P>The life of Savage was a singular <num value="1">one</num>, and, as narrated by his intimate friend, Dr. Johnson, has attracted great interest from all classes of readers. After undergoing experiences of the strangest diversity, at <num value="1">one</num> time living in the most lavish luxury, at another on the brink of starvation; a successful poet to-day, and standing in the felon's dock on a charge of murder to-morrow, he died in <datestruct value="1743--"><year reg="1743">1743</year></datestruct>, in the debtors' prison at Bristol, exhibiting, as Johnson observes, with characteristic solemnity of antithesis, a lamentable proof that <QUOTE>negligence and irregularity, long continued, will make knowledge useless, wit ridiculous, and genius contemptible.</QUOTE> 
<P>Fox Court opens into Brooke Street, and Mr. Cunningham points out this strange coincidence between the career of Savage, and that of the equally unfortunate Chatterton: <QUOTE>Savage was born in Fox Court, Brooke Street; Chatterton died in Brooke Street; Savage died in Bristol, and Chatterton was born in Bristol.</QUOTE> <pb id="P.553" n="553">

 <p><FIGURE id="Fig.553" n="2000.07.0197"><HEAD>The Hall Of Gray's Inn.</HEAD></FIGURE>
<P>Holborn has long been famous as a law quarter of London.   In it are situated Gray's Inn, Staple Inn, and Barnard's Inn, together with what used to be the old legal haunts of Thavie's Inn and Furnival's Inn.   Of these we have now to speak, and the most important of them demands the earliest and deserves a large share of our attention. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.553.1">Gray's Inn</LEMMA>, on the north side of Holborn, and to the west of Gray's Inn Lane, is the <num value="4">fourth</num> Inn of Court in importance and size. It derives its name from the noble family of Gray of Wilton, whose <num value="95">95</num> residence it originally was.   Edmund, Lord Gray of Wilton, in <datestruct VALUE="1505-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1505">1505</year></datestruct>, by indenture of bargain and sale, transferred to Hugh Denny, Esq., <QUOTE>the manor of Portpoole, otherwise called  <Q>Gray's Inn,</Q>  <num value="4">four</num> messuages, <num value="4">four</num> gardens, the site of a windmill, <num value="8">eight</num> acres of land, <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure> of free rent, and the advowson of the Chauntry of Portpoole.</QUOTE> 
<P>From Denny's hands the manor passed into the possession of the Prior and Convent of East Sheen, in Surrey, an ecclesiastical establishment celebrated as having been the nursery of Cardinal Pole, and <pb id="P.554" n="554"> many other distinguished <hi rend=italics>churchmen, in the <num value="6">six</num>-</hi>
 teenth century. By the Convent the mansion of Portpoole was leased to certain   students of law, who paid, by way of rent, <num value="6">6</num> <measure value="13s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="13">13</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> per annum. This arrangement held good till that lively time when Henry VIII. seized all the monastic property he could lay hands on.   The bencher of Gray's Inn were thenceforth entered in the king's books as the fee-farm tenants of the Crown, and paid annually into the Exchecquer the same rent as was formerly due to the monks of Sheen. The domain of the society extends over a large tract of ground between Holborn and King's Road. 
<P>The name of Portpoole still survives in Portpool Lane, which runs from the east side of Gray's Inn Lane into Leather Lane; and Windmill Hill still exists to point out the site of the windmill mentioned in the deed of transfer we have just quoted. 
<P>The old building of Gray's Inn are spoken of by a contemporary writer as boasting neither of beauty, uniformity, nor capacity. They had been erected by different persons, each of whom followed the dictates of his own taste, and the accommodation was so scanty that even the ancients of the house had to lodge double. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.554.1">The Hall of the Inn</LEMMA> was begun to be built in the reign of Queen Mary. It was finished in the reign of Elizabeth (l<num value="560">560</num>), and cost <measure value="863l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="863">863</num></measure> <measure value="10s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="10">10</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> In appearance the Hall is acknowledged to be <QUOTE>a very handsome chamber, little inferior to Middle Temple Hall, and its carved wainscot and timber roof render it much more magnificent than the Inner Temple, or Lincoln's Inn Hall.</QUOTE> Its windows are richly emblazoned with the armorial bearings of Burleigh, Lord Verulam, Sir Nicholas Bacon, Judge Jenkins, and others. <QUOTE>The roof of oak,</QUOTE> we are told by the historian of the <title>Inns of Court and Chancery,</title> <QUOTE>is divided into <num value="6">six</num> bays, or compartments, by <num value="7">seven</num> arched and moulded Gothic ribs or principals. The spandrels, or spaces, are divided by upright timbers, with a horizontal cornice in the centre.   At the extremity of the projecting spandrels is a carved pendant ornament, partaking of the nature of an entablature.   The screen of this Hall is supported by <num value="6">six</num> pillars of the Tuscan order, with caryatides supporting the cornice, in accordance with the style of ornament prevalent at that time. The Hall is also lighted by a handsome louvre, on which was formerly a dial, with the motto <foreign lang=la>Lux Dei, lex Dei</foreign>.   Paintings of King Charles I., King Charles II., King James II., Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Bacon, and Lord Raymond-Lord Chief Justice of the King's Benchhang upon the walls.</QUOTE> 
<P>There is a tradition in Gray's Inn that the Bench tables in the Hall were the gift of Queen Elizabeth, and that Her Majesty once honoured the society by   partaking of a magnificent banquet here. <QUOTE>On every grand day,</QUOTE> says Mr. Pearce, in his <title>Guide to the Inns of Court and Chancery</title>
 (<datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE>the glorious, pious, and immortal memory of   Queen   Elizabeth is drunk with much formality. <num value="3">Three</num> benchers rise to drink the toast; when they sit down, <num value="3">three</num> others rise; and in this manner the toast passes down the Bar table, and from thence to the Students' table. It deserves to be remarked, too, that this is the only toast drunk in the Hall, and from the pleasure   which Elizabeth derived from witnessing the performances of the gentlemen of Gray's   Inn         at her own palaces, and the distinction with     which she on   several occasions received them, it seems probable that the tradition to which reference   has been made is correct, more especially as the Cecils, the Bacons, the Sidneys, and other illustrious personages of her court, were members of this house.</QUOTE> 
<P>The Chapel of Gray's Inn is of modern erection. Likely enough, it was built on the site of the <QUOTE>Chauntry of Portpoole</QUOTE> mentioned in the grant to Hugh Denny.   Divine service was of old performed here daily, and masses sung for the repose of the soul of John, son of Reginald de Graycertain lands having been left for this purpose to the Prior and Convent of St. Bartholomew's, Smithfield. 
<P>The Chapel was an important institution in the olden time. All gentlemen of the Inn were ordered, in <datestruct value="1600--"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>, to frequent it regularly at service-time, as well as at sermons, and to receive the communion every term   yearly, if they were in commons or resided in the house. If they omitted to do so, they forfeited <measure value="3s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> for every time they neglected to receive the communion; and if they did not receive it at least once a year, they were liable to be expelled. 
<P>The Library of the Inn was rebuilt and enlarged in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>-<num value="41">41</num>. It consists of <num value="3">three</num> handsome apartments, ceiled and wainscoted with oak.   <num value="1">One</num> of these is appropriated to the benchers, and the <num value="2">two</num> larger rooms to the barristers and students of the society.   In the principal room is a bust of Lord Bacon.   The Library contains a complete series of reports, from the commencement of the yearbooks to the present day, with a large collection of valuable legal treatises and authorities. 
<P>The Inn was originally divided into <num value="4">four</num> courtsviz., Coney Court; Holborn Court, which lay to the south of the Hall; <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.555.1">Field Court</LEMMA>, between Fulwood's Rents and the shady Walks of the Inn; and Chapel Court, between Coney Court and the <pb id="P.555" n="555"> Chapel. Now it comprises South Square, Gray's Inn Square, Field Court, Gray's Inn Place, Raymond Buildings, Verulam Buildings, and the Gardens. The chambers are well adapted for study and retirement; they are commodious, airy, and quiet, and free from the fogs which, in the winter season, afflict the region near the river. The whole Inn is extra-parochial. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.555.2">Gray's Inn Walks, or Gray's Inn Gardens</LEMMA>, form <num value="1">one</num> of the most interesting features connected with this learned region. In Charles II.'s time, and in the days of the <title>Tatler</title> and <title>Spectator</title>, Gray's Inn Walks formed a fashionable promenade on pleasant summer evenings.   As late as <datestruct value="1633"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct> <num value="1">one</num> could obtain from this spot a delightful and uninterrupted view of the rising ground of Highgate and Hampstead. 
<P>Gray's Inn Gardens had their principal entrance from Holborn by Fulwood's Rents, then a fashionable locality-very unlike what it is now. 
<P> <QUOTE>This spot,</QUOTE> says the late Mr. J. H. Jesse, <QUOTE>was a favourite resort of the immortal Bacon during the period he resided in Gray's Inn. It appears, by the books of the society, that he planted the greater number of the elm-trees which still afford their refreshing shade; and also that he erected a summer-house on a small mound on the terrace, where it is not improbable that he often meditated, and passed his time in literary composition. From the circumstance of Lord Bacon dating his essays from   his  <Q>Chambers in Graie's Inn,</Q>  it is not improbable that the charming essay in which he dwells so enthusiastically on the pleasure of a garden was composed in, and inspired by, the floral beauties of this his favourite haunt.    <Q>God Almighty,</Q>  he says,  <Q><num value="1">first</num> planted a garden; and, indeed, it is the purest of human pleasures. It is the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man, without which buildings and palaces are but gross handy-works.</Q>  And he adds,  <Q>Because the breath of flowers is far sweeter in the air--where it comes and goes like the warbling of music-than in the hand, therefore nothing is more fit for that delight than to know what be the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air.</Q>    As late as the year <datestruct value="1754"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct> there was standing in the Gardens of Gray's Inn an octagonal seat, covered with a roof, which had been erected by Lord Bacon to the memory of his friend, Jeremiah Bettenham.</QUOTE> 
<P>Howell, writing from Venice, <datestruct VALUE="1621-06-5"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=5>5th</day>, <year reg=1621>1621</year></datestruct>, to a friend at Gray's Inn, says, <QUOTE>I would I   had you. here with a wish, and you would not desire in haste to be at Gray's Inn; though I hold your Walks to be the pleasantest place about London, and that you have there the choicest society.</QUOTE> 
<P>Our often-quoted Pepys had an eye to the <QUOTE>choicest society,</QUOTE> and on the <datestruct VALUE="1662-05-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, we find him coming here after church-time, with his wife, to observe the fashions of the ladies; the reason being that Mrs. Pepys was just then bent on making some new dresses.   Here pretty Fanny Butler was, in her brief day, the belle of the ground, and perhaps Pepys was thinking about her quite as much as about the latest fashions. He used to express his admiration at Fanny's beauty with a fervid candour by no means agreeable to the fair young wife on his own arm. 
<P>Sir Roger de Coverley is mentioned by Addison as walking here on the terrace, <QUOTE>hemming twice or thrice to himself with great vigour, for he loves to clear his pipes in good air (to make use of his own phrase), and is not a little pleased with any <num value="1">one</num> who takes notice of the strength which he still exerts in his morning hems.</QUOTE> 
<P>In the old dramatists we not unfrequently come across Gray's Inn Walks as a place of fashionable rendezvous. For example, in Dryden's <title>Sir Martin Mar</title>-all (<datestruct value="1668--"><year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>) there is this reference to Gray's Inn Walks: 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><sp><speaker>Sir John Shallow:</speaker><p>But where did you appoint to meet him? 
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Millisent:</speaker><p>In Gray's Inn Walks.</QUOTE>
 
<P>And in the <title>Miser</title>, by Thomas Shadwell (<datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>), Cheatly says: <QUOTE>He has <measure value="1500l." type=currency><num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> pounds</measure> a year, and his love is honourable too. Now, if your ladyship will be pleased to walk in Gray's Inn Walks with me, I will design it so that you shall see him, and he shall never know on't.</QUOTE> 
<P>Walking in these Gardens, we may thus call up many old associations. In addition to those just mentioned, we may picture to ourselves how those trees once shaded from the hot summer sun young men who loitered here with Butler and Cleveland. We can imagine Mr. Palmer, of Gray's Inn-the ingenious mechanician-pacing up and down these broad Walks, considering the qualities of the last addition to his collection of <QUOTE>telescopes and mathematical instruments, choice pictures, and other curiosities;</QUOTE> or devising some new contrivance for the improvement of that marvellous clock which roused the diarist's wonder and enthusiasm; or listening to John Evelyn's description of the museum of natural curiosities belonging to Mr. Charlton, of the Middle Temple, which collection eventually passed, by purchase, into the hands of Sir Hans Sloane. 
<P>The Gardens became, in time, the resort of dangerous classes; expert pickpockets and plausible ring-droppers found easy prey there on crowded days; and there were so many meetings <pb id="P.556" n="556"> of clandestine lovers, that it was thought expedient to close them, except at stated hours. 
<P>Many a married barrister, long ago; had his wife and family residing with him within the precincts of the Inns of Court. When that was the case, the children must have been bound over to keep the peace, and the lady strictly forbidden, during business hours, to practise on the piano. <QUOTE>Under the trees of Gray's Inn Gardens,</QUOTE> says Mr. Jeaffreson (<datestruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE>may be seen <num value="2">two</num> modest tenements, each of them comprising some <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> rooms and a vestibule.   At the present rime they are occupied as offices by legal practitioners; and many a day has passed since womanly skill decorated their windows with flowers and muslin   curtains; but a certain venerable gentleman, to whom the writer of this page is indebted for much information about the lawyers of the last century, can remember when each of those cottages was inhabited by a barrister, his young wife, and <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> lovely children.</QUOTE> 
<P>The origin of Gray's Inn Gateway we may read of in the following extract from an old author of the beginning of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century:-- <QUOTE>In this present age there hath been great cost bestowed therein upon faire buildings, and very lately the gentlemen of this House [Gray's Inn] purchased a Messuage and a Curtillage, scituate uppon the south side of this House, and thereuppon have erected a fayre Gate, and a Gate-house, for a more convenient and more honourable passage into the high street of Holborn, whereof this House stood in much neede; for the other former Gates were rather Posterns than Gates.</QUOTE> 
<P>The celebrated bookseller, Jacob Tonson, had his shop here, within Gray's Inn Gate, next Gray's Inn Lane.   Here he published Addison's <title>Campaign;</title> and from   this place also he wrote the following letter to Pope : 
<TEXT><BODY><opener><DATELINE>Gray's Inn Gate, <datestruct VALUE="1706-04-20"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=20>20th</day>, <year reg=1706>1706</year></datestruct>. 
<salute>Sir,--</salute><p>I have lately seen a pastoral of yours, in Mr. Walsh's and Congreve's hands, which is extremely fine, and is approved of by the best judges in poetry, I remember I have formerly seen you at my shop, and am sorry I did not improve my acquaintance with you.

<P>Tonson was the <num value="2">second</num> son of Jacob Tonson, a barber-chirurgeon in Holborn.   He was born in the year <datestruct value="1656"><year reg="1656">1656</year></datestruct>; and by his father's will, which was executed <datestruct VALUE="1668-07-10"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=10>10th</day>, <year reg=1668>1668</year></datestruct>, and proved in the following November, he and his elder brother, Richard, and their <num value="3">three</num> sisters, were each to receive the sum of   <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> on their attaining the age of <num value="21">twenty-one</num> --the money to be paid in Gray's Inn Hall.   On the <datestruct VALUE="1670-06-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, we find him bound apprentice for <num value="8">eight</num> years to a bookseller called Thomas Basset, and on the <datestruct VALUE="1677-12-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>, he was admitted a freeman of the Stationers' Company. His <num value="1">first</num> shop was in Chancery Lane, very near Fleet Street, and was distinguished by the sign of the <QUOTE>Judge's Head.</QUOTE> About <datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct> he removed to Gray's Inn, where he remained till about <datestruct value="1712--"><year reg="1712">1712</year></datestruct>, when he removed to a house in the Strand, over against Catherine   Street, and   here   he   chose Shakespeare's head for a sign.   He died, very rich, on the <datestruct VALUE="1735-03-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month> <year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>-<num value="6">6</num>. 
<P>The successor of Tonson in the Gray's Inn shop was another eminent bookseller, Thomas   Osborne, who is oftener than once introduced   in   the 
<title>Dunciad.</title>   Pope makes him contend for the prize among the booksellers, and prove the successful competitor:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Osborne, through perfect modesty o&lsquo;ercome, 
<L>Crowned with the jorden, walks contented home.</QUOTE>
 Osborne is perhaps best remembered by his wellknown feud with Dr. Johnson. Of this Boswell writes: <QUOTE>It has been confidently related with many embellishments, that Johnson <num value="1">one</num> day knocked Osborne down in his shop with a folio, and put his foot upon his neck. The simple truth I had from Johnson himself- <Q>Sir, he was impertinent to me, and I beat him; but it was not in his shop, it was in my own chamber.</Q> </QUOTE> Johnson, in his life of Pope, speaks of Osborne as a man entirely destitute of shame- without sense of any disgrace but that of poverty. He is said to have combined the most lamentable ignorance with extraordinary expertness in all the   petty tricks of his trade. 
<P>Alms were distributed thrice a week at Gray's Inn Gate, for the better relief of the poor in Gray's Inn Lane, in <datestruct value="1587--"><year reg="1587">1587</year></datestruct>, the <num value="29">29th</num> year of Elizabeth's reign. The alms consisted of the broken victuals of the Hall table. The <num value="3">third</num> butler was instructed to see that due consideration was had to the poorest sort of aged and impotent persons, and in case the panyer-man and under-cook should appropriate any of the said alms to themselves, they were allowed, by way of lessening the temptation, <num value="3">three</num> loaves a-piece.   The panyer-man here mentioned was a waiter. The Inner Temple Hall waiters are still called <hi rend=italics>panniers</hi>--according to Mr. Timbs, from the <foreign lang=la>panarii</foreign> who attended the Knights Templars. 
<P>Some of the orders for the government of Gray's Inn are very curious--a remark, however, which might be applied to the regulations of all the other Inns. Let us notice a few of the more remarkable   of these orders, as given by Herbert   in his 
<title>Antiquities of the Inns of Court and Chancery</title>
 (<datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct>). 
<P>At a <hi rend=italics>pension</hi>, or meeting, held in the beginning <pb id="P.557" n="557"> 
<NOTE RESP=B><P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.557.1">Marriot-Gray's Inn Cormorant</LEMMA></NOTE>
 of the reign of King James, it was intimated to be the royal pleasure that none but gentlemen of descent should be admitted to the society.   The names of all candidates were therefore ordered to be delivered to the Bench, that inquiries might be made as to their quality. 
<P>In the reign of Edward VI. it was ordered that double readers were to have in commons only <num value="2">two</num> servants, and single readers <num value="1">one</num>.   If a reader was elected, and he refused to serve, he had to forfeit <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure>. For his trouble he was allowed thirtyfive shillings for a hogshead of wine, and he fared well also as regards venison.   In <num value="28">28</num> Elizabeth (<num value="6">6</num> Junii) the reader for that summer was allowed <QUOTE>for every week <num value="10">ten</num> bucks, and no more.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1615--"><year reg="1615">1615</year></datestruct> the House allowed the   then <num value="2">two</num> readers <num value="2">two</num> hogsheads of wine, <num value="30">thirty</num> bushels of flour, <measure value="30l." type=currency><num value="30">thirty</num> pounds</measure> of pepper, and   a <QUOTE>reward for <num value="30">thirty</num> bucks and <num value="2">two</num> stags, which were to be equally divided between them.</QUOTE> 
<P>To ensure   the      orderly management of the public table, many regulations were made.   In <datestruct value="1581--"><year reg="1581">1581</year></datestruct> there was a cupboard-agreement regarding Easter Day, from which we learn that the members who came to breakfast after service and communion were to have <QUOTE>eggs and green sauce</QUOTE> at the cost of the House, and that <QUOTE>no calves'-heads were to be provided by the cook.</QUOTE> At dinner and supper-time all were to be on their good behavior. No gentleman was to be served out of his proper course; and by a regulation made in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, if any <num value="1">one</num> <QUOTE>took meat by  <Q>strong hand</Q>  from such as should serve him, he was to be put out of commons ipso facto.</QUOTE> 
<P>In the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> year of Elizabeth, the subject of dress was discussed, and an   order   was made <QUOTE>that every man of this society should frame and reform himself for the manner of his apparel, according to the proclamation then last set forth, and within the time therein limited; else not to be accounted of this house;</QUOTE> and that no <num value="1">one</num> should    wear any gown,   doublet, hose, or outward garment of any light colour, upon penalty of expulsion; and within <num value="10">ten</num> days following it was also ordered that no <num value="1">one</num> should wear any white doublet in the house after Michaelmas Term ensuing. 
<P>Hats were forbidden to be worn in the Hall at meal-time in <num value="27">27</num> Elizabeth, under a penalty of <measure value="3s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> for each offence. In <datestruct value="1600--"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct> the gentlemen of the society were instructed not to come into the Hall with their hats, boots, or spurs, but with their caps, decently and   orderly, <QUOTE>according   to the ancient orders.</QUOTE> When they walked in the City or suburbs, or in the fields, they had to go in their   gowns, or they were liable to be fined, and at the <num value="3">third</num> offence to be expelled, and lose their chamber. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> cannot, however, oppose fashion; and though the benchers might talk grandly, in their council-chamber, of its being frivolity, and issue instructions about wearing this, and not wearing that, it is to be feared they did not always get themselves attended to. Was it likely that handsome youngsters were going to make guys of themselves? <QUOTE>Even in the time of Elizabeth,</QUOTE> says <num value="1">one</num> writer, <QUOTE>when authority was most anxious that utter barristers should, in matter of costume, maintain that reputation for <Q>sadness</Q> which is the proverbial characteristic of apprentices of the law, counsellors of various degrees were conspicuous through the town for brave attire.   At Gray's   Inn, Francis Bacon was not singular in loving rich clothes, and running into debt for satin and velvet, jewels and brocade, lace and feathers.                 Even of that contemner of frivolous men and vain pursuits, Edward Coke, biography assures us that the jewel of his mind was put into a fair-case--a beautiful body with a comely countenance: as case which he did wipe and keep     clean,   delighting in   good clothes well worn; being wont to say that the outward neatness of our bodies might ne a monitor of purity to our souls.</QUOTE> 
<P>Among other   ancient constitutions   of Gray's Inn   were the following:--That   no    officer of this house shall hold or enjoy his office longer   than he shall keep himself sole and unmarried, excepting the steward, the chief butler, and the chief cook; that no fellow of the society stand with his back to the fire;   that no fellow of the society make any rude noise in the hall at exercises, or at mealtime; that no fellow of the society, under the degree of an ancient, keep on his hat at readings or moots, or cases assigned; and that search be made every Term for lewd and dangerous persons, that no such be suffered to lodge in the house. 
<P>Mootings, or disputations, in the Inns of Court and Chancery   have long been   disused.   Danby Pickering, Esq., of Gray's Inn, was the last who voluntarily resumed them, but they were not of long continuance.   Indeed, the course of legal education has greatly changed, and scarcely any of the ancient customs mentioned by authors are known, except as matters of curiosity. 
<P>The   Inns of Court were, in the olden time, the scene of many joyous masques and revels, thus following the example set by the nobility in their castles and palaces. During the reigns of Henry VIII.   and Elizabeth, masques, and other goodly <QUOTE>disguisings</QUOTE> sanctioned by the <QUOTE>grave and reverend Bench,</QUOTE> were frequently performed at Gray's Inn. The <num value="1">first</num> entertainment of this kind of which we have specific notice was a masque performed here <pb id="P.558" n="558"> at Christmas, <datestruct value="1527--"><year reg="1527">1527</year></datestruct>.   It was composed by John Roo, serjeant-at-law, and was chiefly remarkable for the great offence which it gave to Cardinal Wolsey, whose ambition and misgovernment it was supposed to satirise. The old chronicler, Hall, giving an account of the events of the eighteenth year of Henry VIII., thus speaks of it:-- <QUOTE>This Christmas was a goodly disguising played at Gray's Inn, which was compiled by John Roo, serjeantat-the- law, <num value="20">twenty</num> year past, and long before the cardinal had any authority. <gap> This play was so set forth with rich and costly apparel, and with strange devices of masks and morrishes, that it was highly praised of all men, except by the cardinal, who imagined that the play had been devised of him. In a great fury he sent for Master Roo, and took 
<FIGURE id="Fig.558" n="2000.07.0198"><HEAD>Gray's Inn Gardens.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 from him his coif, and sent him   to the Fleet; and afterwards he sent for the young gentlemen that played in the play, and highly rebuked and threatened them, and sent <num value="1">one</num> of them, called Master Moyle, of Kent, to the Fleet; but, by means of friends, Master Roo and he were delivered at last. This play sore displeased the cardinal, and yet it was never meant for him, wherefore many wise men grudged to see him take it so to heart.</QUOTE> 
<P>Perhaps Roo, when he wrote his comedy, did not intend any special reference to Wolsey. It seems, however, that the performers were aware that the cardinal would likely take it home to himself. We learn as much from Fox's notice, in his <title>Acts and Monuments,</title> of a Mr. Simon Fish, <num value="1">one</num> of the gentlemen who acted in the piece. <pb id="P.559" n="559"> 
<P>That the presentation of plays was a customary feature of the festivities at Gray's Inn, we may infer from a passage from Dugdale, in his notes on this society.   He says :-- <QUOTE>In <num value="4">4</num> Edward VI. (<datestruct value="11-17"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=17>17</day></datestruct>) it was also ordered that henceforth there should be no comedies, called interludes, in this house out of Term time but when the feast of the Nativity of our Lord is solemnly observed. And that when there shall be any such comedies, then all the society at that time in commons, to bear the charge of the apparel.</QUOTE> 
<P>The Prince of Purpoole's revel at Gray's Inn, in <datestruct value="1594--"><year reg="1594">1594</year></datestruct>, was a costly entertainment, and, in point of riotous excess, not inferior to any similar festivity in the time of Elizabeth. <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>On the <num value="20">20th</num> of De- 
<FIGURE id="Fig.559" n="2000.07.0199"><HEAD>Barnard's Inn.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 cember(St. Thomas's Eve) the prince (<num value="1">one</num> Master Henry Holmes, a Norfolk gentleman) took up his quarters in the Great Hall of the Inn, and by the <datestruct value="01-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct> the grandeur and comicality of his proceedings had created so much talk throughout the town, that the Lord Treasurer, Burghley, the Earls of Cumberland, Essex, Shrewsbury, and Westmoreland; the Lords Buckhurst, Windsor, Sheffield, Compton; and a magnificent array of knights and ladies, visited Gray's Inn Hall on that day, and saw the masque which the revellers put upon the stage.   After the masque there was a banquet, which was followed by a ball. On the day after, the prince, attended by <num value="80">eighty</num> gentlemen of Gray's Inn and the Temple (each of them <pb id="P.560" n="560"> wearing a plume on his head), dined in state with the Lord Mayor and aldermen of the City, at Crosby Place. The frolic continued for many days more, the royal Purpoole, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, visiting Blackwall with a splendid retinue; on another, (Twelfth Night) receiving a gallant assembly of lords, ladies, and knights at his court in Gray's Inn; and on a <num value="3">third</num> (Shrovetide) visiting the Queen herself, at Greenwich, when Her Majesty warmly applauded the masque set before her by the actors who were members of the prince's court, 
<P>So delighted was Elizabeth with the entertainment, that she graciously allowed the masquers to kiss her right hand, and loudly extolled Gray's Inn as  <Q>an house she was much indebted to, for it did always study for some sport to present unto her;</Q>  whilst to the mock prince she showed her favour by placing in his hand the jewel (set with <num value="17">seventeen</num> diamonds and <num value="14">fourteen</num> rubies) which he had won by valour and skill in a tournament which formed part of the   Shrovetide sports.</QUOTE>
 
<P>When the Prince of Purpoole kept his court at Gray's Inn on this occasion, we are told that his champion rode into the dining-hall upon the back of a fiery charger, which, like the rider, was clothed in a panoply of steel. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1612--"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct> the gentlemen of Gray's Inn, in company with those of the other Inns of Court, acted in a great masque at Whitehall, given in honour of the marriage of the   Princess Elizabeth to the Count Palatine.   To cover the expense of this display an assessment was made of <measure value="4l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4">4</num></measure> from each reader; the ancients paying <measure value="2l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2">2</num></measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure>, the barristers <measure value="2l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2">2</num></measure>, and the students <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>s.</measure> apiece. 
<P>The society   of Gray's Inn took an active part in the gorgeous masque which we have described as starting from Ely Place at Allhallowtide, <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct> (see p. <num value="521">521</num> <hi rend=italics>et seq</hi>.). <num value="1">One</num> of the representatives of Gray's Inn, on that occasion, was a Mr. Read, whom all the women, and some of the men, pronounced <QUOTE>as handsome a man as the Duke of Buckingham.</QUOTE> The only accident that happened that day was an unfortunate display of temper towards a Gray's Inn member. <QUOTE>Mr. May,</QUOTE> says Garrars, in <num value="1">one</num> of his letters to Lord Strafford, <QUOTE>of Gray's Inn, a fine poet-he who translated   Lucan-came athwart my Lord Chamberlain in the banqueting-house, and he   broke his staff across his shoulders, not knowing who he was. The king was present, who knew him, for he calls him his poet, and told the Chamberlain of it, who sent for him next morning, and fairly excused himself to him, and gave him <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure> in pieces.</QUOTE> This hot-headed Lord Chamberlain was Philip Herbert, Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, the <QUOTE>memorable simpleton</QUOTE> of Horace Walpole, and <num value="1">one</num> of whom Anthony Wood quaintly observes that he broke many wiser heads than his own. 
<P>The students of the Inns were never the quietest members of the community.   Among the disturbances of Gray's Inn is <num value="1">one</num> mentioned by Pepys in his Diary, <datestruct VALUE="1667-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>:-- <QUOTE>Great talk of how the barristers and students of Gray's Inn rose in rebellion against the benchers the other day, who outlawed them; a great to-do; but now they are at peace again.</QUOTE> 
<P>A few years later we find them up in arms again; but this time their strength is turned against outsiders, and not expended in hitting each other hard knocks.   When building operations commenced in Holborn Fields, and the country about Gray's Inn began to give place to streets and squares, the legal fraternity, anxious to preserve the rural character of their neighbourhood, were greatly displeased.   Lawyers, it is true, were the earliest householders, but that did not serve to mend the matter. Under date of <datestruct VALUE="1684-06-10"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=10>10th</day>, <year reg=1684>1684</year></datestruct>, Narcissus Luttrell wrote in his Diary: <QUOTE>Dr. Barebone, the great builder, having some time since bought the Red Lyon Fields, near Graie's Inn Walks, to build on, and having, for that purpose, employed severall workmen to goe on with the same, the gentlemen of Graie's Inn took notice of it, and thinking it an injury to them, went with a considerable body of a <num value="100">hundred</num> persons; upon which the workmen assaulted the gentlemen, and flung bricks at them.   So a sharp engagement ensued, but the gentlemen routed them at last, and brought away <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of the workmen to Graie's Inn. In this skirmish <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of the gentlemen and servants of the house were hurt, and severall of the workmen.</QUOTE> 
<P>The various eminent members of the Inn now claim our notice.   Sir William   Gascoigne, whose name is familiar to all, was <num value="1">one</num> of the lawyers of the olden time connected with this house.

For his integrity as a judge, as well as for his private virtues, he deserves to be ever held in remembrance. 
<P>He distinguished himself on many occasions, particularly in refusing to pass sentence on Archbishop Scroop as a traitor, though commanded to do so by the king; and still more by committing the <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.561.1">Prince of Wales afterwards Henry V.</LEMMA>, to   prison for contempt of court. This latter incident suggested to Shakespeare <num value="1">one</num> of his most effective scenes. <pb id="P.561" n="561">

But he, sitting without moving, according to the majesty he represented, committed the Prince prisoner to the King's Bench, there to remain until the pleasure of the Prince's father were further known.   Who, when he heard thereof by some pickthank courtier, who probably expected a contrary return, gave God thanks for His infinite goodness, who at the same instant had given him a judge who could administer and a son who could obey justice.</QUOTE> The dramatist puts these words in his mouth:--

<P>Thomas Cromwell, afterwards Earl of Essex, a conspicuous enough individual in his day, and also kept in remembrance by Shakespeare, was another member of this Inn.   He was a man of humble origin, and owed his rise in life to his having been admitted, into the household of Cardinal Wolsey. He is said to have acted as law adviser to the Cardinal, who recognised his abilities, rewarded his devotion, and left him a parting counsel

<P>His successful career did not last long. As often happens, wealth and honour created envious enemies: the clergy, too, viewed him with hatred, and to the nobility he was odious on account of his mean extraction. He fell into disfavour with King Henry, and on the <datestruct VALUE="1540-06-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct>, was committed to prison. He was impeached before Parliament, the articles accusing him of being <QUOTE>the most false and corrupt traitor and deceiver that had been known in that reign;</QUOTE> of being a <QUOTE>detestable heretic,</QUOTE> and of having acquired <QUOTE>innumerable sums of money and treasure by oppression, bribery, and extortion.</QUOTE> He was not allowed to answer these charges in open court, and was sentenced to be beheaded.   The sentence was carried into effect on Tower Hill on the <datestruct value="07-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct> of the same year. 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.561.2">William Cecil, Lord Burleigh</LEMMA>, was another eminent member of whom Gray's Inn can boast. He entered at Gray's Inn in <datestruct value="1540--"><year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct>. <QUOTE>Whether this removal to Gray's Inn,</QUOTE> says Dr. Nares, <QUOTE>were for the purpose of his being bred wholly up to the profession of the law, we are not able to say, since it was no unusual thing in those days for young men of family and talents, who had any prospect of becoming members of the legislature, to go through a course of law at some <num value="1">one</num> of our Inns of Court, in order to become better acquainted with the laws and constitution of their country.   It was regarded, indeed, as almost a necessary qualification.</QUOTE> 
<P>An anecdote of Burleigh's Gray's-Inn days, as quaintly related by his old historian, may afford the reader some gratification. <QUOTE>A mad companion having enticed him to play, in a short time he lost all his money, bedding, and books to his companion, having never used play before.      And being afterwards among his other company, he told them how such   a <num value="1">one</num> had misled him, saying he would presently have a device to be even with him. And with a long trouke he made a hole in the wall, near his playfellow's bedhead, and in a    fearful voice spake thus through the trouke :-- <Q>O mortal <pb id="P.562" n="562"> man, repent! repent of thy horrid time consumed in play, cozenage, and lewdness, or else thou art damned and canst not be saved!</Q>  Which being spoken at midnight, when he was all alone, so amazed him, as drove him into a sweat for fear. Most penitent and heavy, the next day, in presence of the youths, he told with trembling what a fearful voice spake to him at midnight, vowing never to play again; and calling for Mr. Cecil, asked him forgiveness on his knees, and restored him all his money, bedding, and books.   So <num value="2">two</num> gamesters were both reclaimed with this merry device, and never played more. Many other the like merry jests I have heard him tell, too long to be here noted.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>Who Burleigh's <Q>playfellows</Q> were,</QUOTE> says a writer in Knight's <title>London,</title> <QUOTE>nowhere appears, but the future statesman himself was a married man during the greater part of his sojourn at Gray's Inn, and ought to have been more steady than to stake his  <Q>books and bedding,</Q>  after losing his money. However, from many memoranda of Gray's Inn which have come down to our time, it would seem that the students of this society were rather an unruly set.</QUOTE> 
<P>The most distinguished writer on the laws of England who flourished in the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century was Anthony Fitzherbert, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas in the reign of Henry VIII. He once filled the office of reader in Gray's Inn. <QUOTE>His books</QUOTE> --<title>De Natura Brevium,</title> and others-says Fuller, <QUOTE>are monuments which will longer continue his memory than the flat blue stone in Norbury Church, under which he lieth interred.</QUOTE> Fitzherbert assisted to draw up the articles of impeachment against Cardinal Wolsey, which concluded by praying King Henry <QUOTE>that he be so provided for, that he never have any power, jurisdiction, or authority, hereafter to trouble, vex, and impoverish the Commonwealth of this your realm, as he hath done heretofore, to the great hurt and damage of almost every man, high and low.</QUOTE> 
<P>We have already referred to Simon Fish, a student of this inn, who, for taking part in a masque supposed to satirise Wolsey, had to fly the kingdom, in <datestruct value="1527--"><year reg="1527">1527</year></datestruct>. During his residence in Germany, he composed a work called <title>The Supplication of Beggars,</title> attacking the monastic orders in England. It was shown by Anne Boleyn to Henry VIII., who was so pleased with it, as falling in with his projects of plunder, that he not only permitted the return of the author to his native land, but took him under his protection. Fish did not long enjoy his good fortune; he died in <datestruct value="1531--"><year reg="1531">1531</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Passing from   him, however, we come to <num value="2">two</num> much more celebrated members of our inn.   Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England during the greater part of Elizabeth's reign, kept his terms here. In the year <datestruct value="1532"><year reg="1532">1532</year></datestruct> he was admitted a student of Gray's Inn; in <datestruct value="1536--"><year reg="1536">1536</year></datestruct> he rose to the degree of ancient in the society, and in <datestruct value="1550--"><year reg="1550">1550</year></datestruct> was created a bencher. 
<P>Sir Nicholas Bacon had much of that penetrating genius, solidity of judgment, persuasive eloquence, and comprehensive knowledge of law and equity, which afterwards shone forth with so great a lustre in his son, who was, it has been remarked, <QUOTE>as much inferior to his father, in point of prudence and integrity, as his father was to him in literary accomplishments.</QUOTE> He was the <num value="1">first</num> Lord Keeper who ranked as Chancellor. 
<P>Towards the end of his life he became very corpulent, which gave occasion to Elizabeth to make a jest once: <QUOTE>Sir Nicholas's soul lodged well,</QUOTE> she said. To himself, however, his bulk was very cum. bersome, insomuch that, after walking from Westminster Hall to the Star Chamber, which was but little way, he was usually so much out of breath that the lawyers forbore speaking at the bar till he recovered himself, and gave them notice of it by knocking with his staff. His death, in <datestruct value="1579--"><year reg="1579">1579</year></datestruct>, is reported to have happened through a cold, caught from having fallen asleep with his window open, after having been under the hands of his barber. 
<P>But the name of which, above all others, Gray's Inn is proud, is that of Francis Lord Bacon, the youngest son of Sir Nicholas Bacon. This great man's history is well known, so we shall not repeat it, but content ourselves with recording the dates of his admission as a student here, and of his various degrees in the society. He was admitted in <datestruct value="1576--"><year reg="1576">1576</year></datestruct>; became ancient, <datestruct VALUE="1576-11-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1576">1576</year></datestruct>; became barrister, <datestruct VALUE="1582-06-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1582">1582</year></datestruct>; became bencher, <datestruct value="1586--"><year reg="1586">1586</year></datestruct>; became reader, <datestruct value="1588--"><year reg="1588">1588</year></datestruct>, and was duplex reader in <datestruct value="1600--"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>. 
<P>The errors and foibles of this great man were, no doubt, exaggerated by the malice of his enemies, and they have died with him; but his writings will exercise an influence for good on mankind as long as our language lasts; and his <QUOTE>name and memory,</QUOTE> which he proudly bequeathed <QUOTE>to foreign nations and to his own countrymen, after some time passed over,</QUOTE> will long be regarded as <num value="1">one</num> of the most valuable inheritances of this ancient and honourable legal society. 
<P>After his downfall, when he had parted with York House, he resided again at his old chambers at Gray's Inn, whence, in <datestruct value="1626--"><year reg="1626">1626</year></datestruct>, he went <num value="1">one</num> day, with his physician, towards Highgate, to take the <pb id="P.563" n="563"> air. <QUOTE>It occurred to Bacon to inquire if flesh might not be preserved in snow as well as in salt. Pulling up at a small cottage, near the foot of Highgate Hill, he bought a hen from   an old dame, plucked and drew it, gathered up snow in his palms, and stuffed it into the fowl.</QUOTE> He was smitten by a sudden chill, became too ill to return to Gray's Inn, and was carried to the Earl of Arundel's house, close at hand, where he died within a week. In his brief will it was directed that the lease of his rooms, valued at <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure>, was to be sold, and the money given to poor scholars. 
<P>Francis Bacon's progress from Gray's Inn to Westminster, on the <datestruct VALUE="1617-05-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct>, has been described by many writers,. who, however widely they differ in estimating the moral worth of the new Lord Keeper, concur in celebrating the gorgeousness of his pageant:-- <QUOTE>On the <num value="1">first</num> day of Trinity Term, <datestruct value="05-7"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=7>7th</day></datestruct>,</QUOTE> says Mr. Hepworth Dixon, in his <title>Story of Lord Bacon's Life,</title> <QUOTE>he rode from Gray's Inn, which he had not yet left, to Westminster Hall, to open the courts in state, all London turning out to do him honour, the queen sending the lords of her household, Prince Charles the whole of his followers--the lords of the council, the judges, and serjeants composing his immediate train. On his right hand rode the Lord Treasurer,   on his left the Lord Privy Seal, behind them a long procession of earls and barons, knights and gentlemen.  Every <num value="1">one</num>, says George Gerard, who could procure a horse and a footcloth fell into the train, so that more than <num value="200">200</num> horsemen rode behind him, through crowds of citizens and apprentice boys from Cheap, of players from Bankside, of the Puritan hearers of Burgess, through the open courts of Whitehall, and by King Street into Palace Yard. He wore on that day, as he had worn on his bridal day, a suit of purple satin.   Alighting at the   gates of Westminster Hall, and passing into the Court, he took his seat on the bench; when the company had entered, and the criers commanded silence, he addressed them on his intention to reform the rules and practices of the court.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>Lord Bacon's chambers,</QUOTE> says Mr. Pearce, <QUOTE>were in No. <num value="1">1</num>, Coney Court, which formerly stood on the site of the present row of buildings at the west side of Gray's Inn Square, adjoining the gardens. The whole of Coney Court was burnt down by a fire which occurred in the inn about the year <datestruct value="1678"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> 
<P>Gray's Inn can boast of having had as <num value="1">one</num> of its members the patriotic and honest Welsh judge, David Jenkins. He was a famous champion of the royal cause, and in the most troublous time of England's history displayed undaunted courage and unbending devotion to his lawful sovereign. He was admitted a student of Gray's Inn in the year <datestruct value="1602"><year reg="1602">1602</year></datestruct>, was called to the Bar in <datestruct value="1609--"><year reg="1609">1609</year></datestruct>, and on the <datestruct VALUE="1622-05-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1622">1622</year></datestruct>, was advanced to the degree of ancient in this house.   In the discharge of his official duty he imprisoned and condemned several persons bearing arms against King Charles. For this the parliamentarians, laid violent hands upon him, and on Monday, <datestruct VALUE="1647-02-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct>, the keeper of Newgate brought Judge Jenkins, described as <QUOTE>Mr. David Jenkins, judge in Wales, now a  prisoner in that gaole,</QUOTE> to the bar of the House of Commons, upon an impeachment of high   treason. The Speaker asked him what he had to say for himself, and David Jenkins was not slow to reply.  We are informed by a contemporaneous account of his arraignment, that he said <QUOTE>that they   had no power to try him, and at the bar, and in   the open house, gave very contemptuous words and reproaches against the Houses and power of Parliament. He threatened Parliament with the king's numerous issue, with divers other reproachful words,   such as the like were never   offered in the face of a parliament. After he came out of the House, he put off his hat, and spake   to this effect before   the soldiers of the guard and divers   gentleman at the doore:  <Q>Gentlemen, God   bless you all, protect the laws of the kingdom!</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P>His carriage was declared to be a high contempt and misdemeanour, and he was ordered to be fined     <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure>   and   sent back to Newgate. When in prison expected daily to be hanged, and formed the original resolution of being suspended from the gallows-tree with a Bible under <num value="1">one</num> arm and Magna Charta under the other. It never came to that, however; and Judge Jenkins escaped with his life. 
<P>Bradshaw, who sat as president at the trial of Charles I., was a bencher of Gray's Inn. He was <QUOTE>a stout man,</QUOTE> to quote the words of Whitelock, <QUOTE>and learned in his profession; no friend to monarchy.</QUOTE> He entered Gray's Inn in the year <datestruct value="1622"><year reg="1622">1622</year></datestruct>,   was called to the bar on the <datestruct VALUE="1627-04-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1627">1627</year></datestruct>, and was advanced to the degree of ancient on the <datestruct VALUE="1645-06-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1645">1645</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Sir Thomas Holt was once Treasurer of Gray's Inn, and his son, who became Lord Chief Justice, was entered upon the society's books before he was <num value="10">ten</num> years old. Lord Chief Justice Holt is <pb id="P.564" n="564"> deservedly regarded as a bright ornament of this Inn, and his escutcheon holds a prominent place in the principal window of the hall. He was born at Thame, in Oxfordshire, about <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>. His rise as a lawyer was very rapid, and in <datestruct value="1689--"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct> we find him appointed by King William III. Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, an office which he held till his death.   On the removal of Lord Somers he was offered the Chancellorship, but he declined it. On the bench he is said to have conducted himself in a lofty and dignified manner, and to have set an example of spirit and temper which has continued since his day to adorn the English bench. On several occasions he was forced, in the conscientious discharge of his duty, to resist the encroachments of the Crown as well as of the Houses of Parliament. When he died, in <datestruct VALUE="1709-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1709">1709</year></datestruct>, he left behind him, says his biographer, <QUOTE>a reputation for learning, honour, and integrity, which has never been surpassed even among the many eminent individuals who have succeeded him in his dignified office.</QUOTE> 
<P>There is a sketch of the character of Lord Chief Justice Holt in the <num value="14">14th</num> number of the <title>Tatler</title>. <QUOTE>It would become all men as well as me,</QUOTE> remarks the 
<FIGURE id="Fig.564" n="2000.07.0200"><HEAD>Staple's Inn.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 writer, <QUOTE>to lay before them the noble character of Verus the magistrate, who always sat in triumph over, and contempt of vice; he never searched after it or spared it when it came before him.   At the same time he could see through the hypocrisy and disguise of those who have no pretence to virtue themselves, but by their severity to the vicious. This same Verus was, in times past, Chief Justice, as we call it in Felicia (Britain). He was a man of profound knowledge of the laws of his country, and as just an observer of them in his own person. He considered justice as a cardinal virtue, not as a trade for maintenance. Wherever he was judge, he never forgot that he was also counsel. The criminal before him was always sure he stood before his country, and, in a sort, a parent of it; the prisoner knew that, though his spirit was broken with guilt, and incapable of language to defend itself, all would be gathered from him which could conduce to his safety; and that his judge would wrest no law to destroy him, nor conceal any that could save him.</QUOTE> 
<P>The following story concerning this eminent judge has appeared in many books of anecdote: --A   party of the guards was once ordered from <pb id="P.565" n="565"> Whitehall to put down a dangerous riot which had arisen in Holborn, from the practice of kidnapping, then carried to a great extent; and at the same time an officer was dispatched to inform the Chief Justice of what was doing, and to desire that he would send some of his people to attend and countenance the soldiers. <QUOTE>Suppose, sir,</QUOTE> said Holt- <QUOTE>let us suppose that the populace should not disperse on your appearance, or at your command?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Our orders are then to fire upon them.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Then mark, sir, what I say. If there should be a man killed in consequence of such orders, and you are tried before me for murder, I will take care that you and every soldier of your party shall be hanged. Return to those who sent you, and tell them that no officer of mine shall accompany soldiers; the laws of this kingdom are not to be executed by the sword.   This affair belongs to the civil power, and soldiers have nothing to do here.</QUOTE> Then ordering his tipstaves and some constables to accompany him, he proceeded to the scene of tumult; and the populace, on his assurance that justice should be done on the objects of their indignation, dispersed in a peaceable manner. 
<FIGURE id="Fig.565" n="2000.07.0201"><HEAD>Doorway In Staple's Inn.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
<P> <QUOTE>This story,</QUOTE> says Mr. Jeaffreson, in his <QUOTE>Book about Lawyers,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>is very ridiculous, but it points to an interesting and significant event. Of course it is incredible that Holt said,  <Q>the laws of this kingdom   are not to be executed by the sword.</Q>  He was too sound a constitutional lawyer to hold that military force could not be lawfully used in quelling civil insurrection. The interesting fact is this: On the occasion of a riot in Holborn, Holt was formally required, as the supreme conservator of the king's peace, to aid the military; and instead of converting a street row into a massacre, he prevailed upon the mob to disperse, without shedding a single drop of blood.   Declining to co-operate with soldiers on an unarmed multitude, he discharged the ancient functions of his office with words, instead of sabres--with grave counsels, instead of cruel violence. Under similar circumstances, Chief Justice Odo would have clad himself in mail, and crushed the rabble beneath the feet of his war-horse. At such a summons George Jeffreys, having fortified himself with a magnum of claret and a pint of strong water, would have accompanied the king's guards, and with noisy oaths would have bade them give the rascals a taste of <pb id="P.566" n="566"> cold steel. Wearing his judicial robes, and sustained by the majesty of the law, William III.'s chief justice preserved the peace without sacrificing life.</QUOTE> 
<P>Sir Samuel Romilly, the celebrated   English lawyer and M.P. for Westminster, was a member of Gray's Inn. As a student he seems to have had no anticipation of the brilliancy of his future career. We find him writing despondingly to a friend, in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>-- <QUOTE>I sometimes lose all courage, and wonder what fond opinion of my talents could ever have induced me to venture on so bold an undertaking; but it often happens (and I fear it has been in my case) that men mistake the desire for the ability of acting some distinguished part.</QUOTE> He died by his own hand, in <datestruct VALUE="1818-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, during an attack of brain fever, brought on by grief for the death of his wife.

<P>The Inns of Court were instituted chiefly for the benefit of those desiring to devote themselves to the legal profession, but from an early period they were resorted to by Churchmen and sons of the nobility and gentry, to whom it was thought fitting to give some instruction in the principles and maxims of our municipal law. We shall mention a few of the more eminent ecclesiastics who have studied at Gray's Inn.

<P>The author of the <title>Bruised Reed,</title> which led to the conversion of Richard Baxter, and which Izaak Walton bequeathed to his children, was once the preacher of Gray's Inn. He was Dr. Richard Sibbes. His death took place at his chambers, here, in <datestruct value="1635--"><year reg="1635">1635</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Baxter himself tells us of the happy influence which this book had upon him. His father was pious, but his surroundings generally were adverse to all religious impressions. The neighbourhood in which he passed his youth--a village near the foot of the Wrekin, in Shropshire--was all that Queen Elizabeth or King James could have wished; or, says <num value="1">one</num> writer, <QUOTE>if it exceeded her Majesty's allowance-- <Q><num value="2">two</num> preachers enough for <num value="1">one</num> county,</Q>  in complying with her kinsman's  <Q>Book of Sports,</Q>  it showed an excess of loyalty.</QUOTE> The Maypole was erected beside a great tree, near the dwelling of Baxter's father, and as soon as the reader had rushed through the morning prayer the congregation turned out to the village green, and the lads and lasses began dancing.   Young Baxter, however, seems to have been seriously inclined, and the religious teaching of his father was not wholly thrown away. When about <num value="15">fifteen</num> years old, he had, with some other boys, been stealing apples, and whilst his mind was in a state of more than ordinary disquiet, he read a very awakening book called <title>Bunny's Resolution.</title> He became filled with anxiety and foreboding. In the midst of those gloomy days a poor pedlar came to the door selling books. His stock consisted chiefly of ballads, but he chanced to have <num value="1">one</num> good book, and that was the <QUOTE>Bruised Reed</QUOTE> of Dr. Richard Sibbes. The elder Baxter bought it, and to the son it proved a messenger of salvation. The perusal of it, and <num value="1">one</num> of Parkins's works, lent him by a servant, established his faith. <QUOTE>And thus,</QUOTE> he says <QUOTE>without any means but books, was God pleased to resolve me unto Himself.</QUOTE> Nor is it wonderful, that, as he elsewhere remarks, <QUOTE>The use that God made of books above ministers to the benefit of my soul made me somewhat excessively in love with good books, so that I thought I had never enow, but scraped up as great a treasure of them as I could.</QUOTE> 
<P>A few members of the picturesque race of antiquaries and bookworms-irritable, eccentric, and hermit-like--have resided in Gray's Inn. Joseph Ritson, for instance, had chambers here. He lived and died in No. <num value="8">8</num>, Holborn Court. The building. stood against the south wall of the chapel, and has since been pulled down. 
<P>In that entertaining work, the <title>Bookhunter,</title> by Mr. John Hill Burton, the historian of Scotland gives some curious particulars regarding Ritson. He was a man endowed with almost superhuman irritability of temper, and he had a genius fertile in devising means of giving scope to its restless energies.   <num value="1">One</num> of his obstinate fancies was, when addressing a letter to a friend of the male sex, instead of using the ordinary prefix of Mr. or the affix of Esq., to employ the term <hi rend=italics>Master</hi>, aswhen writing to <num value="2">two</num> well-known fellow-workers in the ways of old antiquity-Master John Pinkerton, Master George Chalmers. The agreeable result of this eccentricity was that his communications on delicate and antiquarian disputes were invariably delivered to, and perused by, the young gentlemen of the family, so opening up new little delicate avenues, fertile in controversy and misunderstanding. 
<P>But he had another and more varied peculiarity. In his numerous books he insisted on a peculiar spelling. It was not phonetic, nor was it etymological, it was simply Ritsonian. To understand the efficacy of this arrangement as a source of controversy, it must be remembered that the instinct of a printer is to spell according to rule, and that every deviation from the ordinary method can only be carried out by a special contest over each word. Ritson, in seeing his works through the press, fought every step of the way, and such peculiarities as the following, profusely scattered over his books, may be looked upon as the names of so many battles or skirmishes with his printers: <QUOTE>Compilur,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>writur,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>wil,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>kil,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>onily,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>probablely.</QUOTE> Even when he condescended to use the spelling common to the rest of the nation he insisted on the <pb id="P.568" n="568"> employment of little irritating   peculiarities;   as, for instance, in the word <QUOTE>ass,</QUOTE> a word pretty often in his mouth, he would not follow the practice of his day, in the use of the long and short <QUOTE>fs,</QUOTE> but inverted the arrangement thus, <QUOTE>sf.</QUOTE> 
<P> <QUOTE>This strange creature,</QUOTE> adds Mr. Burton, <QUOTE>exemplified the opinion that every <num value="1">one</num> must have some creed--something from without having an influence over thought and action, stronger than the imperfect apparatus of human reason.   Scornfully disdaining revelation from above, he groped below, and found for himself a little fetish made of turnips and cabbage. He was as fanatical a devotee of vegetarianism   as others have been of a middle state or adult baptism; and after having torn through a life of spiteful controversy with his fellowmen, and ribaldry of all sacred things, he thus expressed the <num value="1">one</num> weight hanging on his conscience, that  <Q>on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, when, tempted by wet, cold, and hunger, in the south of Scotland, he ventured to eat a few potatoes dressed under the roast, nothing less repugnant to feelings being to be had.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P>Opposite Ritson's chambers lived <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.568.1">John Britton</LEMMA>, the eminent writer on topography and architecture, for <num value="3">three</num> years clerk to <num value="1">one</num> Simpson, an attorney, at the handsome salary of <measure value="15s." type=currency><num value="15">fifteen</num> shillings</measure> a week. <QUOTE>Yet,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>with this small income, I felt comfortable and happy, as it provided me with a decent lodging, clothes, and food, and with the luxury of books.</QUOTE> Britton's account of his master is a strange <num value="1">one</num>, and gives an instructive picture of our legal friends at work amassing their <num value="6">six</num> and eightpences. <QUOTE>At <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock he came to the office to receive business letters, each of which he read several times, with pauses between each sentence; by which process <num value="6">six</num> short letters would occupy at least an hour of his time. He devoted more than   another hour to dictating equally laconic letters in reply; whilst a <num value="3">third</num> was employed in reading those answers when written. This vapid waste of time was the practice of every succeeding day for <num value="3">three</num> years.</QUOTE> Britton used occasionally to visit Ritson in his chambers. 
<P>Most of Britton's works were devoted to topography and architectural antiquities, biography, and the fine arts.   Amongst these may be named his <QUOTE>Architectural Antiquities of Great Britain,</QUOTE> and the <title>Cathedral Antiquities of England,</title> works of national value, which will secure lasting fame for their author. A   writer in the <title>Gentleman's Magazine</title>, to which Britton was a frequent contributor, thus speaks of him :-- <QUOTE>To his labours, the architecture, and particularly the ecclesiastical and domestic architecture, of the country, is deeply indebted for the restoration of what was decayed, and the improvement of what was defective; and in his beautiful sketches and masterly engravings, extending through many volumes, he has given us a treasure-house of antiquarian art, and made the pencil and the graver not only perpetuate and preserve much that has long been mouldering into shapeless ruin, but has also supplied many a new model of improved beauty, suggested by his own genius, and carried into effect by his own zeal and perseverance.</QUOTE> Britton was born in I<num value="771">771</num>, and died in <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>. 
<P>The well-known historian, Edward Hall, who wrote the <title>Chronicles,</title> a work which furnished material for so many of the dramatic productions of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was a reader, at <num value="1">one</num> time, in Gray's Inn. We find his name mentioned in connection with a pension of the bench of Gray's Inn, held <datestruct value="05-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct> (<num value="31">31</num> Henry VIII.), when. the king's command that all images of Thomas a Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury in the reign of Henry II., should be removed from churches and chapels, was taken into consideration.   It was then ordered that Edward Hall should see to the taking out of a certain window in the chapel of this house, <QUOTE>wherein the picture of the said archbishop was <hi rend=italics>gloriously</hi> painted,</QUOTE> and place another in its stead, descriptive of Christ praying on the mount. Hall was born about the last year of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century, in the parish of St. Mildred's, London. He died in <datestruct value="1547--"><year reg="1547">1547</year></datestruct>, and was buried, but without any memorial, in the church of St. Benet Sherehog, London. His <title>Chronicles</title> has been differently appreciated by antiquaries.   Bishop Nicholson speaks of it disrespectfully, and says it is but a record of the fashions of summer clothes; but Peck vindicates Hall with some energy. Hall was no favourer of the clergy. 
<P>Amongst other antiquarian members of Gray's Inn we may mention Rymer, whose work, the 
<title lang=la>Foedera</title>, has given him a European reputation. Rymer was born in Yorkshire, and after studying at Cambridge removed to Gray's Inn. He adopted the profession of the law, and in <datestruct value="1692--"><year reg="1692">1692</year></datestruct> succeeded Shadwell in the post of historiographer to King William III. His death took place on the <datestruct VALUE="1713-12-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1713">1713</year></datestruct>, and he found a grave in St. Clement Danes. 
<P>In Gray's Inn lived Dr. Rawlinson, who stuffed <num value="4">four</num> chambers so full of books that he had to sleep in the passage. He was the original of Tom Folio, so pleasantly described in No. <num value="158">158</num> of the <title>Tatler:</title>
 <QUOTE>Tom Folio is a broker in learning, employed to get together good editions, and stock the libraries of great men. There is not a sale of books begins till Tom Folio is seen at the door. There is not <pb id="P.569" n="569"> an auction where his name is not heard, and that, too, in the very nick of time, in the critical moment, before the last decisive stroke of the hammer. There is not a subscription goes forward in which Tom is not privy to the <num value="1">first</num> rough draft of the proposals, nor a catalogue printed that does not come to him wet from the press. He is an universal scholar, so far as the title-page of all authors; knows the manuscripts in which they were discovered, the editions through which they have passed, with the praises or censure which they have received from the several members of the learned world. He has a greater esteem for Aldus and Elzevir than for Virgil and Horace. If you talk of Herodotus, he breaks out into a panegyric upon Harvey Stephens.   He thinks he gives you an account of an author when he tells you the subject he treats of, the name of the editor, and the year in which it was printed. Or, if you draw him into further particulars, he cries up the goodness of the paper, extols the diligence of the corrector, and is transported with the beauty of the letter. This he looks upon to be sound learning and substantial criticism. As for those who talk of the fineness of style and the justness of thought, or describe the brightness of any particular passages; nay, though, they write themselves in the genius and spirit of the author they admire, Tom looks upon them as men of superficial learning, and flashy parts.</QUOTE> 
<P>The quiet seclusion of Gray's Inn has, in bygone times, formed the retreat of many distinguished poets and literary men. It was the residence of George Chapman, the poet, who was born in <datestruct value="1557--"><year reg="1557">1557</year></datestruct>, and died, honoured and beloved, in <datestruct value="1634--"><year reg="1634">1634</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Chapman deserves best to be kept in remembrance for his translation of Homer, whom   he speaks of as <QUOTE>the prince of poets, never before truly translated</QUOTE> --a production which has excited the admiration of many distinguished critics. Coleridge, in sending it to a friend for perusal, specially recommends the <title>Odyssey.</title> <QUOTE>The <title>Iliad</title>,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>is fine, but less equal in the translation, as well as less interesting in itself. What is stupidly said of Shakespeare is really true and appropriate of Chapman--mighty faults, counterpoised by mighty beauties.   Excepting his quaint epithets, which he affects to render literally from the Greek, 
<gap> it has no look, no air of a translation. It is as truly an original poem as the  <Q>Fairy Queen.</Q>  It will give you small idea of Homer, though a far truer <num value="1">one</num> than Pope's epigrams or Cowper's cumbersome, most anti- Homeric Miltonism.   For Chapman writes and feels as a poet--as Homer might have written had he lived in England in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. In short, it is an exquisite poem, in spite of its frequent and perverse quaintnesses and harshnesses, which are, however, amply repaid by almost unexampled sweetness and beauty of language, all over spirit and feeling. In the main, it is an English heroic poem, the tale of which is borrowed from the Greek.</QUOTE> 
<P>Sir Philip Sidney, the author of <title>Arcadia,</title> and the gallant Governor of Flushing, was at <num value="1">one</num> time a student here. And Butler, the immortal author of <title>Hudibras,</title> seems also, says Mr. Pearce, <QUOTE>to have had a chamber some time in the inn, as <num value="1">one</num> of his biographers has supposed he was a member of the house.</QUOTE> 
<P>About the year <datestruct value="1756"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct> Dr. Johnson was a resident in Gray's Inn, but for a short time only. 
<P>Oliver Goldsmith occupied chambers in Gray's Inn early in <datestruct value="1764--"><year reg="1764">1764</year></datestruct>, while his attic in the library staircase of the Temple was preparing.   He was now at work for the Dodsleys, and we get a glimpse of his straitened circumstances in the following brief note to Mr. James Dodsley :-- <QUOTE>Sir,</QUOTE> it runs, being dated from <QUOTE>Gray's Inn,</QUOTE> and addressed <QUOTE>to Mr. James Dodesley in Pall Mall,</QUOTE> on the <datestruct VALUE="1764-03-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1764">1764</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>I shall take it as a favour if you can let me have <num value="10">ten</num> guineas per bearer, for which I promise to account.   I am, sir, your humble servant, OLIVER GOLDSMITH.   P.S. I shall call to see you on   Wednesday   next with copy, &amp;c.</QUOTE> Whether the money was advanced, or the copy supplied in time, does not appear. 
<P>A nephew of Goldsmith, when in town with a friend, proposed to call on Uncle Oliver, in Gray's Inn, when he was setting to work on his <title>Animated Nature.</title>   They expected to find him   in a wellfurnished library, with a host of books; when, greatly to their surprise, the only book they saw in the place was a well-thumbed part of Buffon's 
<title>Natural History.</title>
 
<P>The outspoken William   Cobbett, the writer of the famous <title>Political Register,</title> and as true a representative of the John Bull character as ever lived, was for some years a clerk in the chambers of a gentlemen of this inn.

They were seminaries in which lads underwent preparation for the superior discipline, and greater freedom of the <num value="4">four</num> colleges.   Each Inn of Court had its own Inns of Chancery, yearly receiving from them the pupils who had qualified themselves for promotion to the status of Inns-of-Court-men. In course of time students, after receiving the preliminary education in an Inn of Chancery, were permitted to enter an Inn of Court, on which their Inn of Chancery was not dependent; but at every

 Inn of Court higher admission fees were charged to students coming from Inns of Chancery over which it had no control, than to students who came from its own primary schools. If the reader bear in mind the difference in respect to age, learning, and privileges between our modern public schoolboys, and university undergraduates, he will realise with sufficient nearness to truth the differences which existed between the Inns of Chancery students and the Inns of Court students in the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century; and in the students, utterbar- risters, and benchers of the Inns of Court at the same period he may see <num value="3">three</num> distinct orders of academic persons closely resembling the undergraduates, bachelors of arts, and masters of arts in our own universities.</QUOTE>

<P>The famous Sir Thomas More was <QUOTE>reader by the space of <num value="3">three</num> years and more</QUOTE> in this Inn. He was a member of Lincoln's Inn. Of this great Lord Chancellor of the reign of Henry VIII., <num value="1">one</num> of the most illustrious men of that period, how much might be told! He was the son of Sir John More, an honest judge of the King's Bench, who had some humour in him, if what Camden records be true.   Speaking of the lottery of marriage, he used to say, <QUOTE>I would compare the multitude of women which are to be chosen for wives unto a bag full of snakes, having among them a single eel. Now if a man should put his hand into this bag, he may chance to light on the eel, but it is a <num value="100">hundred</num> to <num value="1">one</num> he shall be stung by a snake.</QUOTE> It has been observed, however, that he himself ventured to put his hand <num value="3">three</num> times into the bag, for he married <num value="3">three</num> wives; nor was the sting so hurtful as to prevent his arriving at the age of <num value="90">ninety</num>, and even then he did not die of anything else than a surfeit, occasioned by eating grapes. 
<P>Sir Thomas was his son by his <num value="1">first</num> wife. He also was not afraid of snakes. <QUOTE>Having determined,</QUOTE> we are told, <QUOTE>by the advice and direction of his ghostly father, to be a married man, there was at that time a pleasant conceited gentleman, of an ancient family in Essex, <num value="1">one</num> Mr. John Colt, of New Hall, that invited him into his house, being much delighted in his company, proffering unto him the choice of any of his daughters, who were young gentlewomen of very good carriage, good complexions, and very religiously inclined; whose honest and sweet conversation, and virtuous education, enticed Sir Thomas not a little; and although his affection most served him to the <num value="2">second</num>, for that he thought her the fairest and best favoured, yet when he thought within himself that it would be a grief and some blemish to the eldest to have the younger sister preferred before her, he, out of a kind of compassion, settled his fancy upon the eldest, and soon afterwards married her, with all his friends' good liking.</QUOTE> 
<P>This marriage proved fairly happy, but, before many years had passed, Jane Colt died.   More then put his hand a <num value="2">second</num> time into the bag, and this time had the ill luck to draw out a scorpion. He proposed to a widow, named Alice Middleton, who would have done well enough for a superior domestic servant: his good judgment and taste deserted him when he decided to make her a closer companion.   Bustling, loquacious, tart, the good dame scolded servants and petty tradesmen with admirable effect; but, even at this distance of time, the sensitive ear is pained by her sharp, garrulous tongue, when its ascerbity and virulence are turned against her pacific and scholarly husband. She had no sympathy for, no feelings in common with him; he had as little in common with her. 
<P>Both humorous and   pathetic, it has been remarked, was that memorable interview between More and Mrs. Alice, in the Tower, when she, regarding his position by the light with which she had been endowed by Nature, advised him to yield even then to the king. <QUOTE>What the good-year, Mr. More!</QUOTE> cried she, bustling up to the tranquil and courageous man. <QUOTE>I marvel that you, who have been hitherto always taken for a wise man, will now so play the fool as to lie here in this close-fitting prison, and be content to be shut up thus with mice and rats, when you might be abroad at your liberty, with the favour and good will of the king and his council, if you would but do as the bishops and best learned of his realm have done. And seeing you have at Chelsea a right fair house, your library, your books, your gallery, and all other necessaries so handsome about you, where you might, in company with me, your wife, your children, and household, be merry, I muse what, in God's name, you mean here thus fondly to tarry.</QUOTE> Having heard her out, preserving his good-humour, he said to her, with a cheerful countenance, <QUOTE>I pray thee, good Mrs. Alice, tell me <num value="1">one</num> thing.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>What is it?</QUOTE> saith she. <QUOTE>Is not this house as near heaven as my own?</QUOTE> The <num value="2">two</num> were thinking of very different things. Sir Thomas More had his eye on <pb id="P.573" n="573"> heaven.   Mrs. Alice had hers on <QUOTE>the right fair house at Chelsea.</QUOTE> 
<P>More, with all his talent, learning, and wit, had in him a great deal of bigotry and superstition: When about <num value="20">twenty</num> years old he began to practise monkish austerities, wearing a sharp shirt of hair next his skin, which he never left off entirely, even when he was Lord Chancellor. As a lay Carthusian he at <num value="1">one</num> time disciplined his bare back with scourges, slept on the cold ground or a hard bench, with a log for a pillow, allowed himself but <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> hours' sleep in the night, and by a score of other strong measures sought to preserve his spiritual by ruining his bodily health. 
<P>He comes before us, very life-like and pleasing, in connection with the charges of bribery, which at the time of his fall were preferred against him before the Privy Council. <num value="1">One</num> story of this period has been often repeated.   A Mrs. Croker being opposed in a suit to Lord Arundel, sought to win Sir Thomas More's favour; so she presented him with a pair of gloves containing <num value="40">forty</num> angels. With a courteous smile he accepted, the gloves, but constrained her to take back the gold. The gentleness of the rebuff is charming. 
<P>In Furnival's Inn Charles Dickens lived from shortly after his entering the reporters' gallery till <datestruct value="1837"><year reg="1837">1837</year></datestruct>, and it was here that the proposal that originated <title>Pickwick</title> was made to him. Dickens has himself described to us what passed at an interview which must be regarded as a happy <num value="1">one</num> by all admirers of the novelist. Mr. Seymour, the artist, had proposed to do a series of cockney sporting plates, which it was thought would take with the public, if accompanied by letterpress, and published in monthly parts. <QUOTE>The idea,</QUOTE> says Dickens, <QUOTE>propounded to me was that the monthly something should be a vehicle for certain plates to be executed by Mr. Seymour; and there was a notion, either on the part of that admirable humorous artist, or of my visitor, Mr. Hall, that a  <Q>Nimrod Club,</Q>  the members of which were to go out shooting, fishing, and so forth, and getting themselves into difficulties through their want of dexterity, would be the best means of introducing these. I objected, on consideration, that although born and partly bred in the country, I was no great sportsman, except in regard to all kinds of locomotion; that the idea was not novel, and had already been much used; that it would be infinitely better for the plates to arise naturally out of the text; and that I would like to take my own way, with a freer range of English scenes and people, and was afraid I should ultimately do so in any case, whatever course I might prescribe to myself at starting. My views being deferred to, I thought of  <Q>Pickwick,</Q>  and wrote the <num value="1">first</num> number; from the proof-sheets of which Mr. Seymour made his drawing of the club and his happy portrait of its founder. I connected Mr. Pickwick with a club because of the original suggestion, and I put in Mr. Winkle expressly for the use of Mr. Seymour.</QUOTE> Between the <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="2">second</num> number of <title>Pickwick,</title> Mr. Seymour died by his own hand, and Mr. H. K. Browne was eventually chosen to fill his place as illustrator.   But that is apart from Furnival's Inn history, so we may leave the rest of the story untold. 
<P>Thavie's Inn was formerly an Inn of Chancery, appertaining to Lincoln's Inn.   It was sold, however, by that society in <datestruct value="1771--"><year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct> to a Mr. Middleton. Having been subsequently destroyed by fire, a range of private buildings was erected on its site. The name it bears is derived from John Thavie, a liberal-minded armourer, with whom   we have already met when speaking of St. Andrew's.   In <datestruct value="1348--"><year reg="1348">1348</year></datestruct> he bequeathed certain houses in Holborn, returning a large rental, for the support of the fabric of that interesting edifice. 
<P> <QUOTE>I must and will begin with Thavies Inne,</QUOTE> says Sir George Buc, <QUOTE>for besides that at my <num value="1">first</num> coming to London, I was admitted for probation into that good house, I take it to be the oldest Inn of Chancery, at the least in Holborn.   It was before the dwelling of an honest citizen called John Thavie, an armourer, and was rented of him in the time of King Edward III. by the chief professors then of the law; viz., Apprentices, as it is yet extant in a record in the Hustings, and whereof my Lord Coke showed to me the transcript, but since that time it was purchased for the students and other professors of the Law of Chancery by the Benchers of Lincoln's Inn, about the reign of King Henry VII., and retaineth the name of the old landlord or owner, Master Thavie.</QUOTE> 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.573.1">Barnard's Inn</LEMMA> is an Inn of Chancery appertaining to Gray's Inn. Formerly it was called Mackworth's Inn, and in the days of Henry VI. we find it a messuage belonging to Dr. John Mackworth, Dean of Lincoln. At the time of its conversion into an Inn of Chancery, it was in the occupation of <num value="1">one</num> Barnard, and his name it has retained ever since. 
<P>The arms of Barnard's Inn are those of Mackworth-party per pale, indented ermine and sables, a cheveron, gules, fretted or. 
<P>The old hall of Barnard's Inn is the smallest of all the halls of the London Inns; it is only thirtysix feet long, <num value="22">twenty-two</num> feet wide, and <num value="30">thirty</num> feet high. It contains a fine full-length portrait of the upright and learned Lord Chief Justice Holt, for <pb id="P.574" n="574"> some time principal of Barnard's Inn; and also of Lord Burleigh, Lord Bacon, Lord Keeper Coventry, and other eminent men. 
<P>In the time of Elizabeth there were <num value="12">12</num> students in this Inn in term, and <num value="24">24</num> out of term; in <datestruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></datestruct> there were, including the principal, ancient, and companions, in all, <num value="18">18</num> members. 
<P>A believer in alchemy, Mr. Peter Woulfe, F.R.S., lived, about <num value="70">seventy</num> years ago, in Barnard's Inn, No. <num value="2">2</num>, <num value="2">second</num>-floor chambers.   He was an eminent chemist, and, according to Mr. Brande, <QUOTE>the last true believer in alchemy.</QUOTE> But little is known of his life. <QUOTE>Sir Humphrey Davy tells us,</QUOTE> says Mr. Timbs, in his <title>Century of Anecdotes,</title> <QUOTE>that he used to hang up written prayers and inscriptions of recommendations of his processes to Providence. His chambers were so filled with furnaces and apparatus that it was difficult to reach the fireside. Dr. Babington told Mr. Brande that he once put down his hat and could never find it again, such was the confusion of boxes, packages, and parcels, that lay about the room.   His breakfast hour was <num value="4">four</num> in the morning; a few of his friends were occasionally invited, and gained entrance by a secret signal, knocking a certain number of times at the inner door of the chamber. He had long vainly searched for the elixir, and attributed his repeated failure to the want of due preparation by pious and charitable acts.   Whenever he wished to break with an acquaintance, he resented the supposed injuries by sending a present to the offender and never seeing him again. These presents sometimes consisted of an expensive chemical product or preparation. He had an heroic remedy for illness, which was a journey to Edinburgh and back by the mail-coach; and a cold taken on <num value="1">one</num> of these expeditions terminated in inflammation of the lungs, of which he died.</QUOTE> 
<P>His last moments were remarkable. In spite of his serious illness, he strenuously resisted all medical advice. By his desire his laundress shut up his chamber, and left him. She returned at midnight, when he was still alive; next morning, however, she found him   dead, his countenance being calm and serene; apparently he had not moved from the position in which she had seen him last. 
<P>A contemporary of Woulfe, also an alchemist, is mentioned by Sir Walter Scott, in his paper on astrology and alchemy, in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>
 (<datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>). About <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct> this enthusiast lived, or rather starved, in the metropolis, in the person of an editor of an evening journal.   He expected to compound the alkahest, if he could only keep his materials digested in a lamp-furnace for the space of <num value="7">seven</num> years. The lamp burnt brightly during <num value="6">six</num> years, <num value="11">eleven</num> months, and some odd days besides, and then unluckily it went out. Why it went out the adept never could guess; but he was certain that if the flame could only have burnt to the end of the septennary cycle, his experiment must have succeeded. 
<P>An order made by the authorities of Barnard's Inn, in <datestruct VALUE="1706-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1706">1706</year></datestruct>, throws some light on legal manners in the beginning of the eighteenth century.   This order named <num value="2">two</num> quarts as the allowance of wine to be given to each mess of <num value="4">four</num> men, on going through the ceremony of <QUOTE>initiation.</QUOTE> Of course this amount of wine was an <QUOTE>extra</QUOTE> allowance, in addition to the ale and sherry allotted to members by the regular dietary of the house. <QUOTE>Even Sheridan,</QUOTE> Mr. Jeaffreson remarks, <QUOTE>who boasted he could drink any <hi rend=italics>given</hi> quantity of wine, would have thought twice before he drank so large a given quantity, in addition to a liberal allowance of stimulant. Anyhow, the quantity was fixed-a fact that would have elicited an expression of approval from Chief Baron Thomson, who, loving port wine wisely, though too well, expressed at the same time his concurrence with the words and his dissent from the opinion of a barrister who observed,  <Q>I hold, my lord, that, after a good dinner, a certain quantity of wine does no harm.</Q>  With a smile, the Chief Baron rejoined,  <Q>True, sir, it is the uncertain quantity that does the mischief.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<P>During the <QUOTE>No Popery</QUOTE> riots of <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, Barnard's Inn very nearly fell a sacrifice to <num value="1">one</num> of those wild acts of incendiarism which at that time disgraced the metropolis.   It stood next to the extensive premises of Langdale's distillery, and Mr. Langdale was both the object of indignation and interest to the mob: in the <num value="1">first</num> place, he was a Roman Catholic; and in the <num value="2">second</num>, he had a plentiful store of tempting liquor in his hands. The attack on Langdale's distillery, and its subsequent destruction by fire, were among the most striking scenes of the famous riots. What ardent spirits escaped from the flames were swallowed by the rioters. Many of them are said to have literally drunk themselves dead; women and children were seen drinking from the kennels, which flowed with gin and other intoxicating liquors; and many of the rabble, who had drunk themselves into a state of insensibility, perished in the flames. A Dr. Warner, who had passed the night in his chambers in Barnard's Inn, writes thus on the following morning to George Selwyn:-- <QUOTE>The staircase in which my chambers are is not yet burnt down, but it could not be much worse for me if it were. However, I fear there are many scores of <pb id="P.575" n="575"> poor creatures in this town who have suffered this night much more than I have, and with less ability to bear it. Will you give me leave to lodge the shattered remains of my little goods in Cleveland Court for a time?   There can be no living here, even if the fire stops immediately, for the whole place is a wreck; but there will be time enough to think of this. But there is a circumstance which distresses me more than anything; I have lost my maid, who was a very worthy creature, and I am sure would never have deserted me in such a situation by her own will; and what can have become of her is horrible to think! I fervently hope that you and yours are free from every distress. .   <num value="6">Six</num> o'clock. The fire, I believe, is nearly stopped, though only at the next door to me. But no maid appears. When I shall overcome the horror of the night, and its consequences, I cannot guess. But I know, if you can send me word that things go well with you, that they will be less sad with me.</QUOTE> 
<P><LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.575.1">Staple Inn</LEMMA> is an Inn of Chancery appertaining to Gray's Inn. The tradition is that it derives its name from having been originally an inn or hostell of the merchants of the (wool) staple. With this explanation, until a better is given, we must rest satisfied. It became an Inn of Chancery in the time of Henry V., and the inheritance of it was granted, <num value="20">20th</num> Henry VIII., to the Society of Gray's Inn. The Holborn front is of the time of James I., and is worthy of notice as <num value="1">one</num> of the oldest existing specimens of our metropolitan street architecture. The hall is of a later date, has a clock turret, and originally possessed an open timber roof. Some of the armorial glass in the windows of the hall date as far back as <datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct>. There are a few portraits --amongst them are those of Charles II., Queen Anne, the Earl of Macclesfield, Lord Chancellor Cowper, and Lord Camden-and at the upper end is the woolsack, the arms of the Inn. Upon brackets are casts of the <num value="12">twelve</num> Caesars. In the garden adjoining used to be a luxuriant fig-tree, which had spread itself over nearly all the south side of the hall. Upon a terrace opposite, the offices of the taxing-masters in Chancery are situated. They were completed in <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>, and are in the purest style of the reign of James I. The arched entrances and semi-circular oriels are highly effective. The open-work parapet of the terrace, and the lodge and gate leading to Southampton Buildings, are very picturesque.   The Inn is divided into <LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.575.2"><num value="2">two</num> courts</LEMMA>, with a pleasant garden behind. 
<P>The doorway shown in our illustration on page <num value="365">365</num> is mentioned by Dickens in <title>Edwin Drood.</title>
 By it <num value="1">one</num> entered the chambers of Mr. Grewgious. What P. J. T. meant, carved on the stone above the door-whether Possibly John   Thomas, or Possibly Joe   Tyler, or what--the reader will recollect occasionally formed an innocent subject of speculation to Mr. Grewgious. 
<P>In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, there were <num value="145">145</num> students in Staple Inn, in term, and <num value="69">69</num> out of term--the largest number in any of the houses of Chancery. 
<P>Reading and mootings were observed here with commendable regularity.   Sir Simon d&lsquo;Ewes mentions that, on the <datestruct VALUE="1625-02-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1625">1625</year></datestruct>, he went in the morning to Staple Inn, and there argued a moot point, or law case, with others, and they did not abandon the exercise till near <num value="3">three</num> o'clock in the afternoon. 
<P>Isaac Reed, who died in <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, had chambers here.   It was in Reed's chambers that Steevens corrected the proof-sheets of his well-known edition of Shakespeare.   His habits were peculiar.   He used, says Peter Cunningham, to leave his house at Hampstead at <num value="1">one</num> in the morning, and walk to Staple Inn. Reed, who went to bed at a reasonable hour, allowed his facetious fellow-commentator the luxury of a latch-key, so Steevens stole quietly to his work, without disturbing the repose of his friend. 
<P>Dr. Samuel Johnson removed to chambers in this Inn, on the breaking up of his establishment in Gough Square, Fleet Street, where he had resided for <num value="10">ten</num> years. We find him writing, under date of <datestruct VALUE="1759-03-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1759">1759</year></datestruct>, to Miss Porter:--

<P>The <QUOTE>little story-book</QUOTE> was <title>Rasselas,</title> which he seems to have written here, at least, in part. Of this entertaining and, at the same time, profound performance, Boswell says:-- <QUOTE>Johnson wrote it, that with the profits he might defray the expense of his mother's funeral, and pay some little debts which she had left. He told Sir Joshua Reynolds that he composed it in the evenings of <num value="1">one</num> week, sent it to press in portions, as it was written, and had never since read it over. Mr. Strahan, Mr. Johnston, and Mr. Dodsley purchased it for <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>, but afterwards paid him   <measure value="25l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="25">25</num></measure> more, when it came to a <num value="2">second</num> edition.</QUOTE>

 <pb id="P.576" n="576"> received for compilations, and works requiring not much more genius than compilations, we cannot but wonder,</QUOTE> adds Boswell, <QUOTE>at the very low price which he was content to receive for this admirable performance, which, though he had written nothing else, would have rendered his name immortal in the world of literature. None of his writings has been so extensively diffused over Europe; for it has been translated into most, if not all, of the modern languages.   This tale, with all the charms of Oriental imagery, and all the force and beauty of which the English language is capable, leads us through the most important scenes of human life, and shows us that this stage of our being is full of  <Q>vanity and vexation of spirit!</Q>  To those who look no further than the present life, or who maintain that human nature has not fallen from the state in which it was created, the instruction of this sublime story will be of no avail ; but those who think justly, and feel with strong sensibility, will listen with eagerness and admiration to its truth and wisdom.</QUOTE> 
<P>There was an alarming fire in Staple Inn, <datestruct VALUE="1756-11-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>.   It consumed several chambers, and <num value="2">two</num> women and <num value="2">two</num> children perished in the flames. The hall fortunately escaped destruction. 
<P>With this description of Holborn and the Inns of Court, which form its most interesting feature, we terminate our account of Old and New London east of Temple Bar. In the succeeding volumes we shall move westward, from   the same starting point, along the Strand, through Westminster, and the western portions of London, and across the water into Southwark. The ground over which we shall travel will be found as replete with memories and   associations   of past history, and striking features of modern progress, as any of that which we have already surveyed.
