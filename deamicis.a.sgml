<head>Jottings about London.</head>
<head>Chapter I.</head>



<p>IT was raining, the sea was rough, and the
steamer rocked like a small boat; when hardly
half an hour out from Dieppe, I felt, for the first
time in my life, the symptoms of sea-sickness.
There were many ladies on board, mostly English,
who were cheerfully munching ham and cheese,
without even appearing to notice the tremendous
rolling, which was deranging the internal economy
of myself and others. ... Truly, sea-sickness does
render man superior to all human vanities. Had
some one said to me half an hour earlier, <q>Look!
here is money enough to stay in London a month
instead of a fortnight, as you intend; and then to
make a tour in Scotland, and then to run over
Ireland; this money is yours, if you will strike
an attitude before these ladies which will make
you ridiculous.</q> I confess my vanity; I should
have refused. Half an hour later, however, I
stood with infinite self-contempt on two dirty
sacks, one foot pointed east and the other west,
my stove-pipe hat pulled over one ear, one trousers




<pb n=4>







leg hitched up, exposing to view several inches
of unmentionables covered with tar, and my head
swaying about with an <emph>abandon</emph> so disagreeable
that I might have served as a rough-and-ready
model for a statue of Languor. <q>Ah, it is a very
sickly sickness, sea-sickness!</q> I must say like
Fucini. For further torment, I had at my side a
French buffoon, who had left Paris with me, and
chaffed me every time I groaned. <q>But you are
not ill, my dear man; you are pining with love
for that charming young lady over there,</q> pointing
to a lady I had not the strength to look at; and
the by-standers laughed. Ladies! Love! Good
heavens ! Had she been the most beautiful creature
on earth I would not--just then--have turned
round to see what she looked like. Even the
thought, <q>This evening I shall see London,</q> which
that very morning had excited me so much, now
gave me an insupportable feeling of <foreign lang=fr>ennui</foreign>. <q>And
to say I have come here,</q> thought I in this wandering fit, <q>through my own choice to amuse myself! Ah, fool! And to think I must needs recross
the sea! Oh, it is impossible! I feel no longer
up to it; I should lose my life there; I will stay
in England; I will seek some means of existence.
I will be a clerk, or teach Italian, if only I may
never see the sea again! To die when my hour
comes is all well enough, but no more of this
torture!</q>








<pb n=5>



<p>A few hours later I was dining in the Brighton
railroad station, and had given up my resolution
of dying in England.
<p>When I started for London, night was coming
on. I stowed myself in the carriage, and began to
taste the great thought that in a few hours I should
be in London. London! I repeated this word
to myself, and made it sound in my mind complacently, as one rings a gold coin on the table.
London! I felt I know not what gusto in saying
to myself, as if I had not known it before, that it
was a preposterously vast city, a great ocean, a
Babylon, a chaos, a something mythical. It is the
largest city on earth, thought I, and in this there
is something absolute, that is found in no other
city; for if there are others more beautiful, of
which one can you say, <q>This is the <emph>most</emph> beautiful?</q> It is a new pleasure to see something
which in a certain sense occupies incontestably the
supreme rank in the world; something beyond
which one's thoughts cannot reach without entering the realm of dreams; something before which
you can say, <q>No man has ever seen anything
greater!</q> Then I enjoyed the thought that I was
going to London alone, without knowing anybody
there, nor even having letters of recommendation;
going as one ought to go there, to be able to feel
one's self adrift in that ocean; to experience that
feeling, almost of terror, which great, unknown





<pb n=6>







expanses inspire; to be <emph>crushed</emph>; to receive, in a
word, the impression, pure and entire, which that
immense city must produce in the mind of a foreigner. And as for this, I had also the advantage
of not knowing a bit of English, being poor in
pocket, having only a valise, the picture of misery,
and in fine all that is needful to feel belittled and
paltry in a great, unknown city. Thinking on all
this, I rubbed my hands briskly and said, <q>London,
I 'm ready!</q>

<p>It was quite dark when I entered the city,
which I did without knowing it, being astonished
when I was directed to get out. I do so, and find
myself under the immense roof of London Bridge
Station, in the midst of a host of cabs and lights.
I jump into the nearest cab, and hand to the cabman a bit of paper, on which is written the name
and street of a hotel, recommended to me by
friends in Paris. The cabman reads, makes a sign
that he has understood, and does not budge. I
make him a sign to jump on to the box and start,
and he stands fast. I begin to inveigh against
him in French; he does not understand a plaguy
word, and leaning peacefully in the doorway,
begins to unfold to me a long rigmarole in English. <q>Now, I'm in a pickle,</q> say I, <q>and what
shall I do?</q> I fold my arms and look at him; he
folds his arms and looks at me; and thus we stay
looking at each other some little time. Finally









<pb n=7>



I lose patience, jump down, shout in his ear,
<q>Mule!</q> and go off on my own responsibility.
I understood later that he had not wanted to drive
me to the hotel because it was too far. <q>I go
off by myself! But how? and whither?</q>  I
confess that at this moment I felt discouraged.
The immensity of that station, of which I could
not find the exit; the not knowing where to go to
lay my head; this first unlucky episode, which
seemed to be an evil omen; the weight of my
valise, which impeded my progress; the dampness
I felt all over me, and the darkness and confusion,
gave me a sudden feeling of sadness and alarm.
After having wandered about a bit, I went through
a doorway and found myself outside. I seemed
to have fallen into chaos. The rumbling of carriages I could not see, the whistling of railroad
trains which passed I could not understand where,
a confusion of lights above and below, on all sides
and at all heights, a fog which would not let me
make out shapes nor distances, and a going and
coming of people who seemed to be fleeing, - such
was the first spectacle which presented itself to
me. Staggering and hobbling along, I went up
the street a little way, like some stupid fellow
who has lost his head; then no longer able to
manage my valise, I set it down and stopped.
Fortune willed that, on raising my eyes, I should
see a colored lantern with the inscription, <q rend='PRE ldquo POST rdquo' lang=fr>On




<pb n=8>




parle francais.</q> It was a hotel; I drew a long
breath, took up my burden, and entered timidly
with the air of a <mentioned>"countryman coming to the city."</mentioned>
An ill-humored woman, who was the landlady, on
hearing my first words, called the waiter, of whom
I inquired about rooms. The waiter, making at
every French word a contraction resembling an
effort to disgorge, and scanning me from head to
foot with that air of mingled protection and distrust which belongs to his race, replied that there
were rooms.  <q>But,</q> added he, <q>we ask five
shillings for them,</q> and he scanned me again from
head to foot with a suspicious air. Truly my
clothing was such as to excuse this distrust.
Nevertheless I felt myself pervaded with a millionnaire's disdain, so tossed a gold sovereign on to
the table, and with a gesture, which at this point
seemed to me worthy of a verse from Dante, I
said, <q>Take your pay and let us on!</q>  They
escorted me to the chamber. I went to bed at
once; but for a long time I could not succeed in
closing my eyes, such a rumbling greeted my ears.
It was a sullen, monotonous noise, as if the sea
were beating against the foundations of the buildings; and in the midst of this beating was a din
of sharp sounds, which seemed to come from very
great distances, and made me think of a thousand
strange things, as if these were sounds of words
escaping from the immense city going to sleep;








<pb n=9>



lamentations from its interminable suburbs, curses
of this formidable city, worn out with fatigue;
accents of accusation and justification, such as one
hears in the great roaring of the sea in a storm.
Little by little the loudest noises ceased, and I
now heard only the monotonous rumbling; then
gradually I heard again the first sounds, -a city
like London has a hard time to get to sleep,-
then they ceased again; finally I got to sleep and
had the most extravagant dreams in the world.
<p>In the morning, quite before sunrise, I sallied
forth, and directed my steps toward the Thames.
I was a few steps from London Bridge, in the
heart of the city proper. Very few people were
to be seen; profound silence reigned; the sky was
gray; it was cold, and a light fog veiled all things
without hiding them. I went toward the bridge
with rapid steps, knowing that from it one enjoys
the grandest view of London.
<p>Reaching the middle of the bridge, I looked
about, felt an instantaneous cold shock from head
to foot, and stood motionless.
<p>A moment later the picture of Paris, as seen
from the Pont Neuf, glowed before me, and seemed
to me extraordinarily insignificant.
<p>Then I leaned against the parapets, and said in
the tone of one who wishes to put his thoughts
somewhat in order, <q>Let me see now!</q>
<p>Beneath is the broad Thames; on one side,




<pb n=10>







vessels as far as the eye can reach; on the other,
a succession of gigantic bridges; along the two
banks, near the bridge, massive, dingy buildings
crowded in disorder together, and overhanging
the water in a row. A little beyond, great piles,
edifices of sinister aspect, enormous vaulted roofs
of railway stations, with long straight lines as of
enormous vessels, and beyond these a medley of
broken outlines and vague shapes, vanishing away
into light ashen hues, so far off as no longer to
present anything but a mighty confusion of foggy
outlines of chimney-pots, towers, cupolas, and
steeples, and farther yet, mysterious perspectives
as of other distant cities, which one guesses at
rather than sees, by an indented outline, very
faintly pencilled on the gray horizon. On all the
neighboring buildings, and also on the bridges
and river banks, a dingy factory color, the look
of a worn-out city, an air of strength and weariness, a something-- I cannot tell you how-
clammy and lugubrious, like a city laid waste by
a conflagration; an immense, sad spectacle!
<p>What queer tricks our brains play us! Before
these spectacles, which ought, at least for the first
time, to absorb us altogether, our thoughts fly off
all of a sudden, a thousand miles away, back to
utter trifles, which have not the slightest relation
with what we are seeing, and of which we should
not condescend to think in our every-day life. I









<pb n=11>



saw London for the first time, and I thought of a
volume of Voltaire's works which I had lent, and
which had not been returned before leaving Turin.
<p>Then I forgot the book, and next there came
uppermost in my mind, as always happens in an
unknown city, a thousand diverse images of persons and things, which I used formerly to portray
to myself in this city as on the background of a
picture; certain stout merchants in Dickens's
novels, Queen Elizabeth, an English family I saw
one day before Ghiberti's doors at Florence, a
gesture my father once made as he said, <q>How
much I would give to see London!</q> and the portrait of Garrick I saw in an illustrated paper.
<p>Then again an inexplicable distraction; such as
observing my beard was too long, and wondering
where I should get breakfast.
<p>Then a very keen feeling of astonishment to find
myself there, as if I had been rained down from
the sky; and a minute later, all of a sudden, an
icy indifference, as if I had always been there;
and then again the fresh amazement of the first
moment. St. Augustine has indeed hit the truth
in saying that he makes almost no account of
travel, so much more marvellous is that which
goes on in our heads than that which we can see
outside.
<p>I crossed the bridge, and came to the little
square, which opens upon the left bank, and faced


<pb n=12>




about toward one of the streets which lead to
St. Paul's; they were all deserted; I turned to
the right, and, after one or two turns, came upon
the fish market (Billingsgate), in a narrow, damp,
and dingy street, so full of carts and people that
one could hardly pass by. I went farther in the
midst of such a penetrating odor of herring that
after a few minutes I might have breakfasted by
rubbing some bread on my clothes. I reached the
famous Tower, the Bastile of London, and walked
around it, gazing suspiciously at its threatening
walls, and I hastily entered the city of docks, with
the purpose of making a long tour there, so as not
to have to return that way. Long, crooked streets,
lined with lofty, sombre-colored walls, with neither
doors nor windows, of a prison-like aspect; motionless groups of hundreds of workmen at the
corners, other groups disappearing silently in the
obscure alleys; for half an hour I saw nothing
else. I went on through these monotonous streets
as through the windings of an ancient fortress,
melancholy and <foreign lang=fr>ennuy&eacute;</foreign>, without knowing where I
should come out. At a certain point, after a long
walk, I perceived I was turning back, and so had
to make anew long turns, to get upon the right
road. I had got behind St. Catherine's Docks, and
thought I was near the end of London Dock, and
proposed to go as far as the India Docks. I had
entered a street with no visible end, shut in on








<pb n=13>



the right by the walls of the docks, on the left by
little buildings, between which stretched away
other very long and narrow streets, lined with
factory towers, warehouse walls, and piles of
smoky little houses. On and on I went, but
instead of getting farther from London I seemed
only to approach the centre. But full of confidence in my legs, and encouraged by my experience in Paris, where, to the great surprise of my
friends, I had done without a cab, I continued to
walk on without fear.

<p>There came a moment, though, when it seemed
to me that it would not be a bad idea to know
where I was. Passing near a group of workmen,
I heard one of them speaking in French; I stopped
and asked him if that was India Dock.
<p>For my only answer he repeated my question,
<q>That the India Dock?</q> and looked at me as
much as to say I was mad.
<p><q>But is it or not?</q>
<p><q>But, my dear sir,</q> he replied, laughing, <q>I
see you have no idea what the city of London is.
This is London Dock.</q>
<p><q>Still London Dock! What if I passed the
gate half an hour ago?</q>
<p><q>What if you did, sir. Don't you know that
the London Dock Tobacco Department alone is a
mile long, sir?</q>
<p><q>How far is it, then, to go to the India Dock?</q>




<pb n=14>







<p><q>Do you want to go by boat or by train, sir?</q>
<p><q>I want to go afoot.</q>
<p>He looked at my feet.
<p><q>I don't know,</q> he answered, <q>but I suppose
it's four or five miles, sir.</q>
<p><q>And what is there, these four or five miles?</q>
<p><q>Houses, docks, warehouses, workshops, and
factories.</q>
<p><q>Without a break?</q>
<p><q>Without a break, sir.</q>
<p><q>And then from the India Dock where do you
go?</q>
<p><q>From the India Dock you go to the Outer
Dock, sir.</q>
<p><q>And how long is the way out to the Outer
Dock?</q>
<p><q>It is very nearly five miles more, sir.</q>
<p><q>All the way among houses and factories?</q>
<p><q>Among houses and factories all the way, sir.</q>
<p><q>From the Outer Dock where do you go?</q>
<p><q>From the Outer Dock you go out opposite
Greenwich.</q>
<p><q>How far?</q>
<p><q>Two or three miles, sir.</q>
<p><q>All the way inhabited?</q>
<p><q>Inhabited all the way, sir?</q>
<p><q>And from Greenwich where do you go?</q>
<p><q>From Greenwich you go on to the East India
Import Dock, sir.</q>








<pb n=15>



<p><q>And it is distant from Greenwich?</q>
<p><q>About eight miles, sir.</q>
<p><q>All the way between houses and factories?</q>
<p><q>Between houses and factories all the way, sir.</q>
<p><q>And then?</q>
<p><q>And then you go on, sir.</q>
<p><q>And where does it end?</q>
<p><q>The Lord knows, sir.</q>
<p>This time I, too, looked at my feet. I took
leave of the workman, and wearily retraced my
steps, saying to myself, <q>Poor, deluded man!
Didst thou expect to come to London to perform
feats on thine own legs?</q>
<p>I crossed the fish market again, passed by London Bridge once more, and made my way into the
heart of the city.
<p>When I reached Fleet Street the great stir had
already begun.
<p>Then I saw London.



<pb n=16>




<div1 type=chapter n=2>
<head>Chapter II.</head>

<p>ON the two sidewalks the crowd was as dense as
at the exit of a theatre, and there was no grouping nor chatting to be seen, nor any one crying
out or gesticulating; all were going along in haste
and silence, each one profiting by every breathing
space, which occurred in the crowd, to push by
the person ahead of him; and all jostling one
another without turning about to beg pardon. In
the middle of the street an immensely long procession of great omnibuses was passing, variously
painted like chariots for the Carnival, with a sort
of staircase of front seats, expanding upwards,
and thus carrying the passengers in the air spread
out <emph>like a fan</emph>,<note type=foot n=1>These 'buses are now to be seen only on a few lines.- <hi rend=italic>Tr.</hi></note> those lowest being almost on the
ground, the highest having their heads on a level
with the second story of the buildings, and sticking out as if they were hanging there. Between
all the omnibuses was an indescribable medley
of carts, carriages, cabs, barouches, gigs, heavy
teams, big wagons covered with advertisements,
huge trucks of every kind, with three, five, and
even up to eight horses tandem, with the nose of
one against the tail of the next, and the hubs of











<pb n=17>



the wheels touching; and there was a continual
squeezing past, by furious darting in and out and a
never-ending formation and dissolution of intricate
combinations of dozens of vehicles, such as to
alarm one at every moment lest they should smash
up and go to pieces altogether, like a single great
machine shattered by one violent shock. Between
the teams and along the sidewalks there were
loaded porters, boys with hand-carts, long lines of
men with great pasteboard advertisements hung
about their necks, toiling to save their lives. At
every corner this immense torrent of men and
things flows in broad channels, receives affluents,
expands and restagnates in squares and courts, or
trickles away in the lanes and blind alleys, in
crooked streamlets, which are lost between the
buildings. Whilst I advance thus, dragged by
the current, I hear a shrill whistle above my head,
and, on raising my eyes, behold a railroad train
passing over a high bridge which bestrides the
street. This train has hardly passed when I hear
another whistle somewhere else, and see a train
flying across the house-tops on one side. At the
same moment, on the opposite side, a cloud of
smoke issues from a large opening in the ground:
it is a third train on the Underground Railway,
which, passing for an instant in the open air,
salutes daylight with a shriek. I reach the mouth
of a wide street, and perceive the Thames and its






<pb n=18>







bridges in the distance, and on the bridges more
trains, which succeed each other, and meet under
the arches; steamboats passing and bowing their
funnels like tall trees bent over by the wind, long
lines of barges towed by tugs, swarms of rafts
and small boats; and along the parapets of the
bridges, processions of people disappearing on the
opposite bank. Proceeding farther, more apparently interminable streets come into view, lined
with huge edifices and filled with more torrents of
people. And everywhere there is rumbling of
iron bridges, shaking beneath the load of very
long trains, whistles, puffs of smoke, weary breathing over my head, under my feet, on land and
water and in the air; a rivalry and rush of things
going and coming, perpetual flights, encounters,
and successions, accompanied by a din and clatter,
and creaking of wheels, trampling and thundering; the confusion of a battle and the good order of
a vast workshop; then the murkiness, the dinginess of the buildings, the silence of the throng,
and the gravity of the countenances, give to the
spectacle I know not what sort of mysterious and
dolorous look, as if that boundless activity were
a fatal necessity, that infinite toil a damnation.
Weary and dumbfounded I sought refuge in an
alehouse, and heaving a deep sigh, <q>What world
is this?</q> I asked myself. <q>How can people live in
this way?</q>








<pb n=19>



<p>A little later I set out to walk again, and came
to Trafalgar Square, which is the centre of the
quarter most frequented by strangers. I was
pleased with the lofty column, which holds erect,
in the very clouds, the statue of the brave Nelson,
and admired the four huge lions which encircle
it; but the square, perhaps because I compared it
with the Place de la Concorde in Paris, struck me
as inferior to my anticipations. This is the rendezvous of all the 'buses of London (West), and
every one may imagine the tumult. Suffice it to
say, I had to laugh, when I thought of what we
call in the Corso at Rome, in the Via Toledo at
Naples, and in certain streets of Genoa, a great
stir, and which beside London is but the <mentioned>"much
ado about nothing"</mentioned> going and coming in a village
on a <foreign lang=fr>f&ecirc;te</foreign> day. I entered the great street called
Whitehall, and came out on Parliament Square,
and thence directed my steps to Westminster
Bridge.
<p>The view enjoyed thence is the most beautiful
in London, and is worth all the views from the
bridges of the Seine. On one hand you see the
delicate Gothic Parliament buildings, crowned with
numberless turrets, and decorated with thousands
of statues of kings and queens, beyond which rise
the towers of glorious Westminster Abbey, the
Pantheon of England; and on the other bank, the
eight graceful buildings belonging to St. Thomas's




<pb n=20>







Hospital, painted in bright colors; and up the
river an open and cheerful horizon. At this point
you seem to be in another London; there is a sort
of serene majesty, as of some more southern city.
The Thames, traversed by a few tugs and boats,
glides silently by the Monument, which represents
the glory and power of England, like a never-ending army passing in review before its sovereign;
and over this clear and tranquil expanse you see
in the far background, dimly, as through a veil,
the dingy, blurred buildings, the bridges swarming with people, and the dense smoke of old London ever astir and at work.
<p>I observed for the first time, standing on that
bridge, that at London, when there is a crowd
in the streets, a great many people, even gentlemen, turn up their pantaloons like peasants; and
that a great many others wear nosegays in their
buttonholes. And I confess I could not help
laughing when I saw, as I often did, an extraordinarily grave countenance, a nosegay, and turned-
up breeches, all on one person.
<p>Returning to the left bank of the Thames, I
strolled through the principal streets, with my excellent map in hand, without needing to ask anything of anybody.

<p>As for the general aspect of the streets of London, one cannot say exactly what it is. No city
presents such a disordered variety of styles, such








<pb n=21>



a capricious mingling of the beautiful and the vulgar, the poor, the sad, and the strange, the grand
and the hideous. It seems like a city new to you
as a whole, but composed of many cities already
seen, to which a common tinge has been given to
conceal their diverse origin. Architectures of all
climes and times are here collected, superposed
and interwoven. In one and the same street alternate the Arabic, Byzantine, Gothic, and Greco-
Roman and the various English orders; a single
structure has Gothic-arched windows, and a Greek
peristyle, Moorish colonnades, and Renaissance
caryatides, the roof of an Indian pagoda and the
walls of an Egyptian temple. At every corner
you see something which transports the imagination a thousand miles away from the spot where
you are. At one point there is a confused reminiscence of Venice, somewhere else is a vague look
of Rome, here Seville is called to mind, there you
think of Cologne, while a little farther you seem
to be in a street of Paris. All these forms that
you have seen elsewhere, blackened as they appear
here by the smoke and fog, seem to have become
more austere, and look, as it were, homesick and
disgusted with this thick atmosphere, by this din,
and the spectacle of this weary life. Moreover,
the excessive profusion of columns and chimneys,
turrets, pendants, and reliefs, ornaments and monumental forms, becomes ostentatious and wearisome.




<pb n=22>







All this art has the look of an importation,
that is ill at ease there. It is a satiety, a waste of
riches and luxury, a struggle for appearances. One
sees the opulent city, which has bought itself beauty
for its weight in gold; and this ostentation smacks
a little of trade in full dress, or old stumps putting
forth new leaves.
<p>With these streets lined with princely mansions, other very long streets form a contrast,
lined with innumerable houses, all of one color,
one height, and one style, with the roof hidden in
such a way that they seem to have none, with no
steps, no blinds, and bare as the walls of a bastion, some as black as the throat of a chimney,
with the doors and windows trimmed with little
white lines, which give them the look of enormous catafalques; other streets are of a dingy red
or sticky yellow color, so as to look like houses
made of mud and soot; and you can walk on between these walls and colors for miles and miles
without meeting a single building to break this
melancholy uniformity, a single dwelling to recall
the rich and magnificent city.
<p>But on the other hand the richness and magnificence of the aristocratic quarters are astounding.
At every step you find yourself before an immense
mansion over-adorned with bass-reliefs and embellishments, and you think it may be a royal
palace ; on the contrary, it is a railroad station, a






<pb n=23>



hotel, or a shop. Entire streets are flanked on
both sides with these splendid colossi, each of
which, as seen from the farther end of the next,
seems quite distant, its black mass looming up
dimly through the fog like a huge, precipitous
rock. The grand, which in other cities is scattered about and must be sought for, here surrounds you; and what seems to you grand in
other cities, being brought hither by the imagination, is lost in immensity. You traverse monumental quarters, you pass from a city of palaces,
silent as if it were uninhabited, into a city of factories, in which you hear a thousand noises without seeing a human form; and thence into a vast
suburb, where an immense population is swarming, and you hear almost no noise; and quitting
this suburb, you enter again a city of palaces.
You are not strolling through a city, you are
travelling over a country.
<p>Who can tell the thousand fleeting impressions
which one feels in straying alone over a city like
London? Amazement is <emph>shot</emph> at you, so to speak;
but between the shots you feel for the most part
only <foreign lang=fr>ennui</foreign> and weariness. Ten times an hour you
ask yourself, <q>Am I really enjoying myself? Is
this all the pleasure one feels in travelling?</q> At
times you are assailed incontinently by a dread of
falling ill in the middle of the street, being handled by who knows whom, and carried off who


<pb n=24>





knows where. At certain points you find mysterious analogies of place, circumstances, and persons, so that you seem to have been formerly at
that same point, at that same hour, with the same
sunshine, with the same odor in the air, at some
remote period. At moments you are seized with
causeless cheerfulness, a sudden love for the country you are in, which makes you look on all the
passers-by with a benevolent eye, as if they were
all friends. At other moments a suspicious glance
or an ungracious answer from an unknown person
changes your mind and makes you see everything
black, makes the country hateful to you. The
lamentable sound of a hand-organ in certain gloomy
and populous streets makes you think confusedly
of the infinite mysteries of misery and crime which
lie hidden in these immense human ant-hills, and
makes you ardently desire to escape thence into
the open air, into some solitary country place you
may have seen in passing ten years before, through
the window of a stage-coach.

<p>At one time, finding myself near a station, I
thought I would take a trip in the Underground
Railway. I go down two or three stairs and find
myself suddenly thrown from daylight into obscurity, amid feeble lights, people, and noise, trains
arriving and departing in the dark. Mine draws
up and stops; people jump down and people jump
into the carriages; while I am asking where the






<pb n=25>



second class is, the train in gone. <q>What does this
mean?</q> I say to an employ&eacute;.  <q>Never mind,</q> he
answers; <q>here is another.</q> The trains do not
succeed, but pursue each other. The other train
comes, I jump in, and away we go like an arrow.
Then begins a new spectacle. We run through the
unknown, among the foundations of the city. At
first we are buried in thick darkness, then we see
for an instant the dim light of day, and again
plunge into obscurity, broken here and there by
strange glowings; then between the thousand lights
of a station, which appears and disappears in an
instant; trains passing unseen ; next an unexpected
stop, the thousand faces of the waiting crowd, lit
up as by the reflection of a fire, and then off again in
the midst of a deafening din of slamming doors,
ringing bells, and snorting steam; now more darkness, trains, and streaks of daylight, more lighted
stations, more crowds passing, approaching, and
vanishing, until we reach the last station; I jump
down, the train disappears, I am shoved through
a door, half carried up a stairway, and find myself
in daylight. But where? What city is this? How
shall I get out of it? <foreign lang=it>Adagino</foreign>, let us go into an
alehouse and study the map.
<p>After a profound study I succeeded in finding
the way to the British Museum, the one of all the
museums of London which most stimulated my
curiosity. I traversed hastily the immense halls


<pb n=26>







of sculpture, the Egyptian and Assyrian saloons,
and stopped in the hall of manuscripts, to gaze
upon Shakespeare's lease and the contract to sell
"Paradise Lost," and other innumerable autographs of the greatest artists and monarchs of the
world. But out of all these autographs only two
struck me profoundly, and I could not for a
while keep my eyes off them. They are two little
sheets, on one of which is written a sum, and
on the other are traced little circles, some arranged
in a straight line in the middle, the others gathered
together in a corner; and the sum and circles alike
seem to have been made in haste by a slightly
agitated hand. These two sheets of paper are assuredly, among the great number in the museum,
those on which some one wrote and drew in a most
solemn moment. Who could have seen in the
minds of these two men, as they were in the act of
tracing out those numbers and circles, the raging
tempest! The numbers represent the forces of the
English army, and were written a little before the
battle of Waterloo; the circles represent the vessels of the English and French fleets, and were
made a little before the battle of Aboukir; the sum
is by Wellington, the sketch by Nelson. Manuscripts of Galileo, Newton, Michelangelo, Franklin,
Washington, Moliere, Charles V., Peter the Great,
Durer, Luther, Tasso, Rousseau, and Cromwell,
there are enough of them to give away and keep.


<pb n=27>


<p>But here is another strange thing: while I don't
know now what I would not give to have before
my eyes a single one of those papers, then, when
I had only to stoop to see them, I felt not the faintest shadow of curiosity, and what is strangest, I
foresaw, I was certain I should repent of not looking at them. I rebuked myself and asked myself,
<q>Why are you not curious?</q> and answered myself,
<q>Give it up.</q> And I felt an evil mania to go
away, and ran over those halls with barbaric indifference for all those treasures, amongst which
there is the wherewithal to pass a month in a continual succession of pleasures.
<p><q rend='PRE ldquo POST rdquo' lang=it>Mi paghi no!</q>
<p>On leaving the museum I heard these words
grumbled out by an unknown person who was
about to enter. <q>Oh, sweetest mother tongue!</q>
said I to myself, stopping to glance at the
stranger. He seemed to be a workman, and was
conversing with a woman, apparently his wife.
Perceiving that I had turned, he turned, too, and
surprising me smiling, (see the concatenation!)
instead of understanding that I was a compatriot
lost in the ocean of London, whose heart he had
cheered with his <q rend='PRE ldquo POST rdquo' lang=it>paghi no,</q> and that, if I had
dared, I would have invited him to dine with mad
delight, why must it flash through his head that
I have been making eyes at his wife? Why must
he answer my suave look with basilisk eyes? and



<pb n=28>







seeing I continue to look, advance one step with
the air of coming to knock me on the head? <q>Ungrateful Lombard!</q> I muttered sadly, continuing
on my way, <q>thou hast stabbed me to the heart.
Go thy way. For the love of our common mother,
I pardon thee!</q>
<p>Before evening I thought I would take a trip in
an aerial railway, so I took a return ticket for some
point in the city. It is a pleasure quite different
from, but not less keen than, that of the subterranean trip. You run among the house-tops, in the
region of smoke and swallows, flying through a
boundless forest of chimney-pots, pipes, vanes,
skylights, and ridge-poles; you see a thousand
little unknown recesses, in that shapeless, capricious, solitary architecture, which grows rank like
the wild vegetation of an immense pensile field, on
the top story of the vast city; one discovers a
thousand little mysteries in little windows, human
dens, gables which seem   suspended between
heaven and earth, and in which even numerous
families make their nests, with their little aerial
gardens; you see below, at the end of the streets,
the black throng over which you pass as over a
torrent, hardly hearing the noise; and all about,
the eye takes in great distances, perceiving at
times the Thames, the masts of the vessels in port,
the verdure of the vast parks, the towers of the
suburban factories, and everything but the confines of the marvellous panorama.







<pb n=29>



<p>But I had still before me a trip on an omnibus.
I scrambled on to the roof of the first one I saw,
allowed myself to be carried to the end of the
line, and then returned to my starting-point. On
the way I had occasion may times to wonder at
the most familiar ease with which some one of my
neighbors, in order to pass from one part of the
seats to another, made use of my shoulder as a
support, causing me to feel for a moment the whole
weight of his person, and giving me, on removing
his hand, a vigorous shove like a gymnast who
flings away his pole after jumping the rope. The
first who rendered me this service, as he struck
me unexpectedly, left me in amazement. As is
natural, I turned to have at least the offset of a
smile, which should mean, <q>Excuse me.</q> Oh, no!
He had shoved my shoulders about without giving himself the trouble to see how tall I was.
Seeing this was the custom, I took my precautions,
and every time I saw a fellow-passenger reaching
out his hand, I held out my shoulder, saying,
<q>Help yourself,</q> and so held firm till he had done
so. Thus I came out a little less injured. But
also I was rewarded on this same omnibus by
the pleasure I had in becoming persuaded that
one can very well keep up an agreeable conversation without mutual understanding. A youth by my
side, who had seemed very affable, addressed me
in English. I replied in French, <q>I do not understand.</q>

<pb n=30>




He did not understand that I did not
understand, and went on smiling. I made signs
with my head, <q>No, no,</q> he should not trouble
himself, it was wasting breath. Perhaps chance
willed that that <q>No</q> came <foreign lang=fr>&agrave; propos</foreign> to a question
he had asked me, and he continued more fervidly
than ever. Then since he enjoyed talking so
much, I pretended to understand, making half-smiles and indeterminate signs, which could not
disagree with anything he might be telling me.
Then beginning to be bored with playing this <foreign lang=fr>r&ocirc;le</foreign>,
I bethought myself that as he was talking to me
in a tongue <emph>I</emph> did not understand, I might as well
talk to him in a tongue <emph>he</emph> did not understand, and
I began to discourse in Italian. It was Egyptian
darkness; nevertheless he laughed, clapped his
hand on my knee, and began to listen with a look
of curiosity, as if I had warbled him an <foreign lang=it>aria</foreign>; and
then he began again in English, and so it went on
for a while, to our mutual satisfaction, until the
omnibus stopped. We alighted, and he gave me
a time-table of a steamboat company, of which I
fancy he was an agent, and we separated shaking
hands, like two persons who had found themselves
of one mind on all the questions of the day.
<p>In the evening I had not the courage to challenge the <mentioned>"blues,"</mentioned> so I fled from them, repairing
in time to the hotel.  Oh! had I had there some
one to pay for listening to me, I would willingly








<pb n=31>



have given him half a sovereign, such was the
need I felt of letting myself out in chat, after
seeing so many things, without being able to say
one. Not knowing what else to do, I began to
prepare the comparisons and illustrations of which
I should make use at home to give an idea of the
size of London, and as for several days I had
done nothing but turn pages in guides and ask information of every one I met, material was not
lacking.
<p><q>Know, then!</q> I said to an arm-chair appointed
to personate an intimate friend, <q>that London
is sixteen miles long and fifty-five miles round
about; that the towns which gradually gather
about it contain the population of Florence, as,
for instance, Greenwich, or the population of
Rome, as Chelsea, or the population of Marseilles,
as Hackney; that with merely the serving-men in
London one could make an army more numerous
than the Italian army in time of peace; that with
the gaslights which light its ten thousand miles of
streets one could illuminate a street running round
one quarter of the earth's circumference; that
reckoning ten quarts of beer as the quota to intoxicate a German, with the quantity consumed in
London in a year there is enough to get the whole
German army on a war footing drunk twice; that
putting one behind the other all the beasts butchered and eaten in London in one year, you could


<pb n=32>



make a continuous line which would stretch across
all Europe, from the Straits of Gibraltar to the
northern extremity of Russia; that with the oysters annually swallowed at London one could
cover the whole Champ de Mars at Paris with the
Pont d'I&eacute;na and Place du Trocad&eacute;ro; that across
London Bridge twenty thousand vehicles pass
daily.</q>
<p>On the following morning I went to see the
Crystal Palace.







<pb n=33>


<div1 type=chapter n=3>
<head>Chapter III.</head>

<p>THE brief trip from Victoria Station to Crystal
Palace offers the variety of a long journey. You
pass first among other very swift trains over a
wide bridge which is like a square suspended over
the Thames, on which the rails cross each other so
thickly as to present an almost continuous surface
of iron. You pass by the large Battersea Park;
then comes a succession of stations, galleries, and
factories, surrounded by hundreds of operatives'
houses, which form, as it were, villages within the
city; all the houses of one shape and color, each
with its little garden and swarms of children on
all sides; then more parks, frames of vast edifices,
sketches of little cities, which will be built and
populated ere a few months, stores, gardens, castles, cemeteries, and as far as the eye can reach
great piles of building materials which foretell
other cities to come beyond. Under the tunnels,
on the rafters of the roofs, even on the chimney-
pots, even in the trees, even on the roadside, is a
prodigious profusion of quack advertisements,
which override each other like venders' cries in a
market, and give to the place the fantastic aspect
of a bazaar covering an entire province.



<pb n=34>







<p>Finally you see, on a hill-top, the enormous pile
of the Crystal Palace, which displays to the whole
county of Kent the delicate majesty of its transparent arches.
<p>Within, it is a single huge hall, a little world.
At the first glance you take in nothing. From
one court you pass into a caf&eacute;, from a caf&eacute; into a
bazaar, from a bazaar to a garden or museum.
Amongst cypresses, laurels, aloes, palms, and all
the pompous plants of the Torrid Zone, giraffes
stretch out their necks, and Michelangelo's statues raise their heads. From the sphinxes of
an Egyptian court-yard you see in the distance a
Greek house with the group of the Laoco&ouml;n and the
Venus of Milo. From a Greek house you enter
a Roman house; here your' gaze penetrates into
the mysterious little chambers of the Alhambra;
and from the Alhambra you look into the court of
a little Pompeian house.  You go out and pass
between groups of lions and tigers, fighting and
biting, between two rows of eagles and parrots,
and next come out in a Byzantine court, from
which, through a series of doors, you see the
court of a medieval house, the hall of a Renaissance palace, or the chapel of a Gothic church. You
go on among sepulchral monuments, fountains,
doors embellished with historical designs, and all
the masterpieces of modern sculpture; and you
come into the midst of a crowd at the door of a







<pb n=35>



theatre, where they are playing <title>Il Trovatore.</title>
A little beyond, on one side, you see a musical
stage, seating three thousand artists, under a semi-
cupola twice as large as the dome of St. Paul's,
and on the other side a stage on which a professor is giving lectures on mathematics. You
pass before a comic theatre, <foreign lang=la>camerae-obscurae</foreign>,
circuses, and enter a labyrinth of grand bazaars in
the forms of temples and kiosks, in which are exhibited the most splendid industrial products of
all countries, from Cairo to Birmingham, and from
Paris to Pekin. You run through the corridors
of libraries, between long rows of piano-fortes,
carriages, furniture, and vases of flowers, and you
go wandering among the trees and dens of a forest
peopled with savages from Africa or Oceanica,
scattered on the hunt, or gathered in families about
their hearths, or ambushed behind rocks in the act
of shooting arrows at each other. You go up a
staircase; galleries stretch endlessly away before
you, where you can walk miles among oil
paintings, water colors, photographs, and busts of
celebrated men. And above these, more galleries
with a thousand turns, from which on looking out
you take in at a glance the beautiful landscape of
the county of Kent, and looking below, all that
fantastic circuit of halls, gardens, courts, theatres, and restaurants; people going up and down,
and thronging about the theatres, and appearing


<pb n=36>



and disappearing among the plants and statues;
and on this prodigious variety of forms, colors, and
sights, of this compendium of the world, arched
over by a crystal firmament, the sunlight darts in
and spreads a glow over everything, throwing
prismatic colors and rays and showers of silver
sparks along the walls and azure arches.
<p>On returning to London a mishap befell me
which made me bitterly regret not knowing English. In the railway carriage there was a gentleman
smoking a pipe. I lit my last Virginia cigar from
the remainder of a package I had brought from
Paris. I had just lighted it when a lady entered.
I make a gesture, as if to ask whether smoke
annoys her; she answers me something in English,
which from the expression of her face I take to
mean, <q>Yes, it does.</q> I summon all my power
of sacrifice, and throw my cigar out of the window.
<p>It has not reached the ground before the gentleman with the pipe catches me by the arm, and
gives me to understand in French, that the lady
has replied that, <emph>on the contrary</emph>, she likes tobacco
smoke. I look at the window, my empty hand,
and the lady laughing, and <q><emph>feel faint as though I
should die.</emph></q>
<p>Arriving at London, I went to Westminster
Abbey, the Santa Croce of England.
<p>On entering this church, were one alone, he
would bow his head to the pavement.







<pb n=37>



<p>A Pantheon of this nature is a mighty argument
in marble for the immortality of the soul
<p>As soon as you enter your eyes are lifted to the
lofty Gothic arches of the roof, and then turn
upon the population of statues which surrounds
you. There great men are massed and crowded
together, hiding one another. A few steps bring
you to Pitt, Palmerston, and Robert Peel, a vanguard worthy of this host.   In one corner is
Pasquale Paoli.  The images of the supremely
glorious are mingled with the less renowned, and
instead of obscuring, shed lustre upon them. It
is a divinely <emph>democratic</emph> Pantheon. Great princes
slumber beside great poets. Near Shakespeare is
a pedagogue, -Andrew Bell; near Newton a
standard-bearer.  Between two illustrious admirals, Garrick, the actor, who is represented between the stage-curtains with a smile on his lips.
Among a host of chamberlains, abbots, and ministers, among whom   you pass indifferently, you
meet the dear and glorious images which make
your heart beat, like friends met anew in an
unknown country, Gray, Milton, Goldsmith,
Thomson, Thackeray, Addison, and     the last,
beloved and mourned like the greatest, Charles
Dickens. Among the famous admirals, who dyed
sea and land with blood, shines the serene and
intact glory of the great benefactors; the apostles of
the abolition of slavery; Hanway, the philanthropist;



<pb n=38>







Wintringham, the physician; James Watt,
the inventor of the steam engine. Beside the dazzling greatness of genius, the austere greatness
of upright minds, indomitable characters, long
lives spent in patient works and unknown sacrifices. But what diverse thoughts we have in those
chapels, clothed with marvellous stone embroidery,
where you walk between the sepulchres of princes,
between the memorials of the power and misfortunes of seven races of kings! If all the blood
shed by axe and dagger, from the veins of the persons buried between the tombs of Henry the Seventh and Edward the Confessor, were to spread
suddenly over the sanctuary, not a span of marble
would stay spotless. Mary Stuart, Lord Stafford,
the husband of Anna, Duchess of Somerset,
beheaded; Thomas Tyrone, assassinated; Aymer
of Valence, Earl Pembroke, assassinated; Thomas
Woodstock, Duke of Salisbury, assassinated;
Richard the Second, assassinated; Edward the
Fifth and his brother, Duke of York, unhappy sons
of Edward, assassinated; the Duke of Buckingham, assassinated; Spencer Percival, Chancellor
of the Exchequer, assassinated; Nicolas Bagenall, suffocated in his cradle by his nurse. After
going round in the chapels I seized a moment,
when the verger was looking another way, to seat
myself on the old throne of the king of Scotland;
and then I clapped my hand on the stone on which







<pb n=39>



the patriarch Jacob laid when he had the divine
vision.
<p>He who has not seen it rain in London, has not
seen London; and I had this pleasure the morning I went to see the Tunnel under the Thames.
Then I understood how, in such weather, one can
be seized with the temptation to give one's self a
pistol shot. The houses drip as if sweating; the
water seems not only to descend from the heavens,
but also to ooze from the walls and ground; the
sombre colors of the buildings turn yet gloomier
and take on an oleaginous look; the beginnings
of the streets seem like entrances to grottos;
everything seems foul, used up, mouldy, and sinister; the eye knows not whither to turn, not to
meet something disagreeable; one feels shudderings, which have the effect of a sudden attack of
misfortune; one feels an irksome sense of weariness, a disgust with everything, an inexpressible
wish to go out like a lamp from this weary world.

<p>As I was thinking of these things I disappeared
from the world indeed, going down a lighted spiral
staircase which buries itself in the earth on the
right bank of the Thames, opposite the Tower.
I went down and down between two dingy walls
until I found myself at the round opening of the
gigantic iron tube, which seems to undulate like
a great intestine in the enormous belly of the
river. The inside of this tube presents the appearance


<pb n=40>




of a subterranean corridor, of which the
end is invisible. It is lighted by a row of lights
as far as you can see, which shed a veiled light,
like sepulchral lamps; the atmosphere is foggy;
you go along considerable stretches without meeting a soul; the walls sweat like those of an aqueduct; the floor moves under your feet like the
deck of a vessel; the steps and voices of the people coming the other way give forth a cavernous
sound, and are heard before you see the people,
and they at a distance seem like great shadows;
there is, in short, a sort of something mysterious,
which without alarming causes in your heart a
vague sense of disquiet. When then you have
reached the middle and no longer see the end in
either direction, and feel the silence of a catacomb,
and know not how much farther you must go, and
reflect that in the water beneath, in the obscure
depths of the river, is where suicides meet death,
and that over your head vessels are passing, and
that if a crack should open in the wall you would
not even have the time to recommend your soul
to God, in <emph>that</emph> moment how <emph>lovely</emph> seems the
sun !
<p>I believe I had come a good part of a mile when
I reached the opposite opening on the left bank of
the Thames; I went up a staircase, the mate of the
other, and came out in front of the Tower of London.








<pb n=41>



<p>These execrable monuments<note type=foot n=1>It is, properly speaking, a group of eight towers and other
buildings.</note> to human cruelty
and misfortune always inspired me with a repulsion stronger than curiosity; but recalling the
names of those who died between those walls, I
felt the strength to enter. You have hardly passed
the first precinct when terrible memories flock
upon you. The castle, constructed in a pentagonal
form, is surmounted by eight towers, each one of
which calls to mind a famous prisoner and a miserable death. In one the sons of Edward the
Fourth were assassinated; in another Henry the
Sixth was murdered; in a third the Duke of Clarence, Edward the Sixth's brother, was drowned in
a butt of wine. In the clock-tower Queen Elizabeth was kept; in Beauchamp Tower Anne Boleyn
passed the last days of her life; in the Brick Tower
Jane Grey. After a few steps you reach the little
square of secret tortures, where, among many other
victims, Jane Grey was beheaded. At a short distance stands the little church where lie buried
Anne Boleyn and Robert Devereux, who were
poisoned, stabbed, or strangled in secret. The
castle, nude and lugubrious without, is yet more
so within. The staircases, straight and flat-roofed,
lead into great, dismal halls, long, half-lit corridors, and sinister cells, those tombs of the living,







<pb n=42>







where so many wretches tore their hair and
beat their heads against the wall, crazed with
despair. The mind is turned from these thoughts
for a time among the armor of kings and princes, a collection on the ground floor; and then
sinks again at the sight of the horrible secret
prison where Walter Raleigh, Elizabeth's favorite,
languished twelve years; the axe and the block,
still blood-stained, where thousands of prisoners in
the Tower were beheaded; the instruments, still
intact, with which flesh was torn and bones crushed,
without death being dealt.  Groans escaping from.
a human being, only together with life, horrifying
shrieks, heart-rendering words of supplication,
superhuman resistance from those who will not
die, you both hear and see in thought most vividly
while visiting the retreats of that accursed pile.
<p>In a side-room, under a large glass case, protected by an iron railing, is seen a heap of sceptres,
diadems, and orders, dazzling as the rays of electric light; these are the regalia of the crown of
England, which represent all together the value of
seventy-five million francs (fifteen million dollars).
<p>On leaving the Tower of London I saw for the
first time a man drunk with gin. He horrified
me. I had not believed drunkenness could thus
transform a man.  Our wine-drunkards, being
either immoderately jolly or drowsy, are, I am


<pb n=43>



ready to affirm, an agreeable sight in comparison
with these men, with convulsed and distorted
faces covered with mortal pallor, with an expression of illness and insanity, and eyes staring and
fixed like those of a dead man. And these depraved creatures thus sunken are seen still gulping down the tremendous liquor, and hurled down
as if lightning-struck, shamefully beating their
heads against the walls and tables, covering their
faces with blood; and the by-standers assist at the
scene laughing.
<p>But a sight which compensated me in the streets
and parks of London for the brutal spectacle of
drunkards was the children, those dear little
English children, who deservedly enjoy the reputation of being the nicest and freshest in the
world. From the golden color of a sovereign
to the ashy blonde of the lightest silk, or the
fresh silk on an ear of maize, you see hair of every
blond shade, falling in large, almost transparent
waves, which tempt you to take a scissorsful as
you go by. Then little cheeks of all gradations
of rose-color, from the pale leaves which clothe
the flower to the tiny, dainty ones which nestle
close to the pistil; little mouths so crimson that
you wonder the birds do not peck at them; eyes
so pure and heavenly as to put to shame the
cherubs hovering about Murillo's conceptions. If
I did not carry off an armful of these children it is






<pb n=44>

simply because I did not know where to put them.
But I had not the strength to resist another temptation. One day in Green Park I picked one up
who passed near and snatched kisses enough to
take his breath away, and handing him back to his
nurse who had rushed up to save him, I made a
gesture of entreaty as much as to say, <q>Excuse
me, I had need of it.</q>
<p>The children remind me of Mme. Toussaud's
celebrated exhibition of wax figures. I did not
repent of having been there; but I received an
impression rather painful than agreeable. Just on
entering I found myself before Napoleon III.'s remains lying in state in his grand marshal's uniform, and so admirably imitated that I felt a
repugnance to drawing near. As I was looking I
saw out of the corner of my eye a gentleman beside me showing signs of grief; I turned, stared
at him, and fell back with a shudder; it was
Pietri, - in wax, - dressed in black, standing erect
among the people like a spectre. In the Great
Hall of Kings, where there are hundreds of kings,
queens, generals, and entire courts of England
and Spain in the splendid costumes of the periods,
I breathed more freely. On walking about the
throne of a king of Arragon I brushed against M.
Thiers's forelock; I next slipped between the Emperor William and Prince Frederic Charles, and
passed before Jules Favre and Bismarck, who were







<pb n=45>



discussing some topic with great warmth in a side-
room. In the hall where are gathered England's
most famous criminals I rushed through. Those
ferocious <emph>cretins'</emph> faces, those circumspect attitudes
and blood-stained clothes, in that semi-obscurity,
which hardly allowed one to realize the fiction,
horrified me. Had some one at that moment uttered a cry behind a curtain, I should have believed one of those murderers had planted a
knife in his heart.
<p>One day I went to see the famous Bank of
England, which has a trifling <foreign lang=fr>corps</foreign> of nine hundred employ&eacute;s, to which it pays six poor millions
of francs' wages ($1,200,000), and possesses in its
coffers the neat sum  of four hundred millions
($80,000,000) in gold and silver, and preserves
under a glass bell a bank-note worth a bagatelle
of twenty-five millions ($5,000,000). I entered
the great hall where payments were made. A
hundred employ&eacute;s, standing at a hundred little
windows, distribute gold and silver with jugglers'
rapidity, in rolls, handfuls, and shovelfuls, and
creditors hastily fill pockets and bags and make
off like robbers, casting suspicious glances about
them. You should see the gleaming and flashing
of smiles, the very slight workings of the eyebrows and lips, and the thousand most expressive
but inexpressible movements of the faces at the
sight of the gold; and you should see that gold,


<pb n=46>




how it frisks, jumps, and sparkles, and clinks like
cheery laughter, and does every sort of coquetry,
so that it seems animated and rascally. I, too,
before this spectacle felt for the first time a guilty
disturbance, and made such a face that any one
who had seen me at that moment would have cried,
<q>Arrest him!</q>  This feeling I should not have
had at eighteen. At that age one never thinks of
<emph>not</emph> <mentioned>"getting rich."</mentioned> Youth, as a great poet has
said, is a <mentioned><emph>mysterious awaiting,</emph></mentioned> and among the
thousand things expected in the distant and indefinite future is <mentioned>"getting rich."</mentioned>  One hopes still
vaguely for legacies from unknown relatives, and
for packages of bank-notes found on the bedroom
table some evening after the theatre, sent by no
one knows whom; but every passing year cancels
one word of these fanciful promises of our good
genius, and then the sight of gold makes us
thoughtful and awakes melancholy longings, not
from love of ease, but for that dear independence which forced labor deprives us of, and to be
able to work ten years at a time on a book, to
keep at home four teachers of languages, to travel
in Africa, to offer your lady-love a diadem of
rubies and a palace of granite.
<p>I went that same day to see Barclay's renowned
brewery, which pays government a tax of four and
a half million francs ($900,000), and consumes
annually three hundred thousand hectolitres of







<pb n=47>



barley (about 900,000 bushels). After having
roamed about the streets of a quarter in Southwark, hunting for the entrance, I inquired and
was given to understand, to my great amazement,
that I was already in the brewery, and up to that
moment had done nothing but go about within its
walls. <q>Call it Barclay City then!</q> I said to the
guide who accompanied me.  The phlegmatic
Englishman smiled, and through gratitude poured
forth copious minute explanations, putting me
through the interminable labyrinths of those buildings, around lakes of foam, amid Titanic hogsheads and brawling cascades of beer; and when
at last I begged a truce for my legs, he conducted
me to rest on a lofty terrace, whence, pointing
with outstretched arm, as a general indicates an
encampment, at that ample circuit of houses, stores,
and stables, which form the Barclay brewery,
<q>Here,</q> said he, loftily, <q>is the biggest brewery
on earth!</q>
<p>That same evening I passed again by the Bank
of England, saw the exchange, and lingered a
while in that cross-roads where London's business
furnace is; and then, all carried away by this
sight, I returned home agitated by a mania I had
never before felt, to plunge into business and heap
up riches.  <q>Now what is <emph>writing</emph>?</q> said I to
myself; <q>there must be <emph>action</emph>! What is this
spending life as a <emph>word dealer</emph>? It is a rhetorical


<pb n=48>




life. One should work on hard-pan. Thanks be
to Heaven, I am still in time.  There are plenty
of others who have taken up business later than
I, and have still succeeded in making their fortunes.  When once I am back in Italy I will
bestir myself, I will seek, I will do something
My friends will laugh, eh?  Let them!  I will
laugh, too, when I build a villa at Fiesole ....
Let us see a bit, what <emph>branch</emph> I might try. I must
begin in a small way. Wine and liquors. ... I
don't know. Cotton?</q> At this moment I seemed
to see a little finger pointed at me, and I heard a
sweet voice ask, <q>You?</q>  Then I laughed and
gave up business.

<div1 type=chapter n=4>
<head>Chapter IV.</head>

<p>To see the London museums well you should be
rich, able to pitch your tent comfortably in the
great city for a year. Otherwise your visits to
museums become nothing but forced marches. I
feel as if I were still running over the interminable
halls of that universal emporium called the South
Kensington Museum, always hoping on entering a
new hall it would be the last, and always letting
my arms drop on seeing another doorway as soon
as I had passed one. It is all I can do to remember Raphael's famous cartoons, or Lawrence's marvellous Hamlet, who stopped me in a corirdor
to propound to me the tremendous enigma. The
little museum of paintings, however (the National
Gallery), in Trafalgar Square, does not present any
such difficulty, and I have still vividly before my
eyes that immortal <foreign lang=fr>mariage &agrave; la mode</foreign> by Hogarth,
for which he was paid two thousand francs, and
which was resold for a twenty times larger sum,
fifty years later; Turner's fantastic battles of light;
Raphael's pictures, sought for twenty years; and
those of the painters preferred in England,- Correggio, Poussin, Murillo, and Claude Lorraine.
But I made only forced marches in the Indian



<pb n=50>






Museum, the Soane Museum, the Marine Museum,
and the Surgeons' College, where you can see the
skeleton of Carolina Cracami, the famous Sicilian
dwarf, who could be buried under a tall hat; and
of Byrne, the Irish giant, who used as he passed
through the streets to give a light to the people
in the first story.
<p>But the impression which will remain strongest
with me is that made by the House of Commons.
I entered it unwittingly - it was empty. I looked
and looked again, and it never even entered my
head that it was the House. A chamber, small in
appearance, decorated with a magnificence full of
aristocratic grace, which gives it the air of the
choir of a cathedral for elegant services, and which
would be admirably adapted for an assembly of
little blond-haired countesses in white frocks;
when I learned it was the House of Commons,
that House where sounds the simple, tranquil eloquence of the first orators in the world, which is
then echoed and cut up into presumptuous sentences
and pedantic quotations in the Latin parliaments,
I made a gesture of respect and asked permission
to touch the mace with the tips of my fingers, with
the hope it might transmit to me the <emph>un</emph>-Latin virtue of peaceable discussion.
<p>After the fatiguing visits to museums and palaces I would go to rest in the parks,- in those
great oases in the <emph>populous desert</emph> of London,







<pb n=51>



where the soul cheers up again to see that the
world is not all houses and railroads; where hundreds of fine-looking women on handsome horses
coursing through avenues with no visible end, and
thousands of children scattered and romping over
the immense fields and on the shores of large
ponds furrowed by numberless boats, make you
think with pleasure that life is not all traffic and
fatigue; where the luxuriant vegetation, the hilarity of the faces, and the melody of Italian music
revive in you with a feeling of tender yearning
the image of your dear country which you will
soon see again. Oh! Hyde Park, Regent's Park,
Victoria Park, and St. James, Greenwich, and
Southwark, Battersea, and Holland Parks,- beneficent consolers of my melancholy moods, -I
salute and thank ye; and I think again, too, with
gratitude of Windsor Castle Hill, Eton Groves,
Richmond Avenues, and Kew Gardens, and all the
pleasant environs of London, whither I fled from
the murderous <foreign lang=fr>ennui</foreign> of the Sundays. Ah! he
who has not seen London on Sunday knows not
what <foreign lang=fr>ennui</foreign> is. Closed doors, shutters up, deserted streets, silent squares, entire quarters abandoned, where one might die of hunger without
being seen or succored; the desolation of an uninhabited city; an infinite tedium over all things;
you would say the statues slumber, the buildings
look bored, and you open your mouth with such



<pb n=52>


wide, lengthy, and violent gaping that frequently
you begin to feel your face to see if anything is
dislocated.
<p>London grew upon me daily; however far I
walked in any direction, I never succeeded either
in seeing the end, or so much as a thinning out of
buildings to suggest it.  In certain quarters, on
passing by a second time, I would discover tracts of
city as large as Florence which the first time had
escaped my notice. Every day, even merely in
the West End quarters, which I frequented, I would
see open before me, as if by enchantment, some
immense street I had not even seen on the map. I
would begin my pilgrimage in the morning, and
pass by the places visited on the previous day
without recognizing them; I would come to a
park, where I would stop to recover my breath
and courage; and then off again through the infinite labyrinth of streets, now on foot, now on a
'bus, now in a cab, uttering an exclamation of
amazement on turning every corner, as when one
reaches a mountain-top and discovers all at once
a new country.  I have still in my head a thousand confused pictures of crossings full of people,
of great solitary spaces, and foggy distances, seen
on I know not what day nor in what part of London; which often get confounded with the visions
of those imaginary cities which we see in our
dreams.









<pb n=53>



<p>London's grandeur and wealth made upon me a
different impression at every moment. Sometimes
I felt my Italian <foreign lang=fr>amour propre</foreign> crushed; I would
remember with contempt the petty boasts to which
we give utterance at home, comparing ourselves
only with ourselves; I proposed, when I should
be back in Italy, to rebuke them with sarcasm; I
should have liked to have been born an Englishman, to have the right to look down upon the
Latin peoples. At other times, however, the spectacle of the superiority of this country gave me but
a keener affection for my own, mingled with pious
patriotism. <q>Should a son, perhaps,</q> thought I,
<q>love his mother the less that she is both poor and
ill?</q> Often, too, not even this greatness seemed
to me enviable. <q>Vanity!</q> I said, <q>vanity! To
what end, as Leopardo's shepherd asks, is all this
great stir, this bustle of men and things? Are they
more contented than we? They have wealth!
Well, we have no fog, and a poor devil in sunshine enjoys life, perchance, more than a rich man
in the dark. And are there not here miseries and
griefs infinite?</q> And even this poor Italy afforded
satisfaction to my <foreign lang=fr>amour propre</foreign>.  When some
courteous fellow-passenger in a coach, perceiving I
was an Italian, would turn upon me a half-benevolent, half-curious look, as if to search in my face
for something to correspond to that vague picture
of beautiful things and joyous life which the name





<pb n=54>


of Italy awakens in every foreigner's mind, I felt
a keen pleasure and saw in the glass of the opposite window-pane that my eyes sparkled and my
cheeks reddened.
<p>But what a lesson of modesty this travelling is!
How narrow it seems to travel the circle of notions
and ideas, in which we habitually live, and which
yet at home among our friends and books seems to
us so vast! To see that one half, at least, of
what forms the <emph>Treasury of Instruction,</emph> which
we have garnered in so many years of study and
observation, has almost no value in the foreign
land we are in! To handle the fact that at home,
when we thought we were reading the book of the
world, we only really read one page; that a thousand things which seemed to us great, important,
and enough to fill half the world, are only our
<mentioned>"ole clo'es,"</mentioned> which are of no account whatever
one step outside our own door! At every step
we make in a foreign country a gulf opens as it
were before our eyes, in which we see beneath the
abysses of our own ignorance; and there greets
us from the bottom a laugh of compassion. But
there are moments, on the other hand, in which
the motion of our ideas takes place so rapidly that
we see, divine, and take in in a twinkling so many
things previously unknown or obscure to us, that,
could this feverish mental activity be continual,
we should be extraordinary men. What grand








<pb n=55>



designs we make then, which vanish like smoke at
the next turn in the road!
<p>What most amazed me in London, next to its
wealth and grandeur, was its good order. This
enormous city is divided into districts like a Dutch
village. The functions of its immense life are carried on like clock-work. A stranger who understands a little French frees himself, unaided, from
every embarrassment and without losing a minute
of time. The walls of the 'buses, covered with
innumerable inscriptions, guide you constantly,
and at every step some one thrusts into your hand
a printed paper, which gives you a bit of advice
or useful hint. In whatever portion of London
you may wander, you have only to follow the
direction of the first train you see passing on the
house-tops; the train leads you to a station, and
the station walls point out your way home. One
day I jumped on to a 'bus without knowing whither
it might be going; I was taken several miles out
of London, and alighted at a country restaurant,
and was alone. No one there understood a word
of French; I could not even tell where I was, till
a 'bus should go by again. I felt somewhat uncomfortable. I rambled through the village, all shiny
houses and tidy gardens, where I met only some
young aristocrats on horseback, or saw some blond
<mentioned>"miss's"</mentioned> head through the windows, and all was
as silent as a graveyard. What should I do?



<pb n=56>




Where should I go? All at once I heard a puffing, which went to my heart like a friend's voice;
I ran that way, and in fifteen minutes was in London.
<p>The evening in London is very <foreign lang=fr>triste</foreign> for a stranger.  I had fierce attacks of "blues." Accustomed to the fantastic splendors of the Paris boulevards, and to their great festive activity, London
streets seemed dark and melancholy. I missed
the crowded caf&eacute;s, the handsome shops, and even
the dissolving views on the Boulevard Montmartre, forgetting the indignation awakened in me by
the spectacle of the barefaced, brilliant, and triumphant immorality which reigns there on all
sides. But what a mystery are these discouragements, the fits of deep sadness which assail us of
an evening in an unknown city! And so deep
that at times one has a countenance which excites
compassion in the passers-by ? <q>But why?</q> you
ask yourself; <q>you are well, you are not short of
money, you have good news from home, you are
free; to-morrow morning you will have diversion,
within ten days you will return to your country;
then why this suicidal frown?</q> Who can say?
I, too, like De Maistre's leper, when I saw a married couple pass by with children, nurse, and baby,
all happy and laughing, I felt bitter envy and
turned my head the other way.
<p>One can at London, by means of recommendations,







<pb n=57>



obtain permission to accompany the night-round of the police in those foul quarters where
the population of beggars and criminals swarms,
and penetrate the dens where these wretches pass
the night for a few farthings. I rambled through
these quarters only by day among the houses
where the opium-drinkers go to stultify themselves, where obscene balls take place for a half-penny admission, where the boxing <foreign lang=it>dilettanti</foreign> go to
see the play of eye-crushing, teeth-smashing fists;
whither women return with heads broken by
drunken husbands; where the consumptive courtesan meets the blood-stained robber; where impurity begins with girlhood and ends with old age;
where ferocity, lasciviousness, and misery have
their tenebrous trysting-place, like hideous monsters, and lay their heads together to send victims
to the Thames, the hospital, or the scaffold, where
in short the rottenness of the great city ferments,
where Charles Dickens went with his servant to
drink beer.
<p>The most beautiful morning I passed in London
was the last, capped with the most delightful cosmopolitan meal I have yet partaken of. I had climbed
the Wren Tower, that famous tower which records
a conflagration of four hundred and sixty streets
and fourteen thousand buildings, from the top of
which the eye takes in at a glance the great movement on London Bridge, and all the streets which



<pb n=58>




converge there on the left bank of the Thames. I
found up there five prepossessing young men chatting cheerfully, and, with one exception, maltreating the French tongue with all the <foreign lang=fr>nonchalance</foreign> of
barbers' boys; I chimed in, and after a few words,
learned to my great delight that one was from Cologne, one from Manchester, one from Haarlem,
one from Guadalajara, and the fifth from Lyons;
so that, including myself, the groups represented
six countries; Germany, England, France, Italy,
Spain, and Holland, - three Latin and three northern peoples, -four healthy monarchies, and two
sick republics. We laughed over the singular
encounter, because the German and Dutchman
had just come some moments earlier, and the
other three had met in the same way the day
before; so, giving ourselves the air of some International Commission of Arbitration, we went to
lunch together. Except the Spaniard, and the
Italian, too, more or less, they were all beer-
sponges; the table was quickly covered with
empty glasses; and the conversation became most
animated. The fumes of the beer had lulled political hates and differences, and awakened on the
contrary in all six of us a feeling of universal
love, which broke forth in clamorous toasts to the
prosperity and glory of all the nations represented,
<q>although unworthily,</q> as said the gentleman from
Lyons in that jovial convention, <q>which should have


<pb n=59>



served as an example for the governments.</q> Before
the eighth bottle came, Alsace was restored, every
shadow of fear of war on the Roman question was
dissipated, all the Carlists scattered on the French
frontier were in irons, and Luxemburg was secured
forever against the pretensions of Germany. Then
Guttenberg, Coster, Michelangelo, Mendoza, Newton, the Prince of Orange, and Victor Hugo were
made to dance on the table, and on them fell
a shower of <emph>dessert</emph> adjectives, emphasized with a
swallow; divine! sublime!! immense!!! superhuman!!!! ; then forgetfulness waxed greater and
greater, and each began to tell facts about himself,
viz.: I am a merchant. - I am a journalist. - I a
painter. - I have- something or other. And then
followed mutual inquiries about each other's age,
and declarations such as, <q>You're a fine specimen
of a German,</q> and <q>You're a fine type of an
Italian,</q> joined with assassination of each other's
native tongue, and every now and then some one
would exclaim, <q>But we're not drinking here!</q>
And lastly came grand projects and appointments
for the coming year at Paris, Amsterdam, or Constantinople, on such a street, such a day, and at
such an hour, and <q>Mind! I'll be there!</q>
<q>You'll write me!</q> <q>Good luck!</q> and now a
grand final clinking of overflowing glasses, to the
shout of <q>Hurrah for civilization!</q>
<p>At noon I went aboard a steamer near the
Tower, bound for Antwerp.


<pb n=60>





<p>The fabulous greatness of London cannot be
seen entirely, but by sailing up and down the
Thames; then London Bridge and the city proper
vanish in comparison with the port; the whole
city of London is belittled.
<p>When the steamer started, the sunshine was
brilliant and the air was clear.  We entered
between two lines of great vessels, and passed in
a few minutes by St. Catherine's Docks, which
embrace the space once occupied by twelve thousand inhabitants, and serve as a port for vessels
arriving from Germany, the Netherlands, France,
and Scotland; we left London Docks behind,
which contain in their basins three hundred high-decked vessels, in their warehouses two hundred
thousand tons of merchandise, and afford employment to three thousand workmen of all countries;
and we went swiftly on, grazing by ships, tugs,
barges, and vessels of every shape, going and coming on the broad river. For a little while the
sight is not extraordinary. Huge piles and interminable rows of bags, hogsheads, and bales encumbering the banks, dikes, bridges, and entrances
of the streets; very long enclosing walls, endless
black buildings, and everywhere factory smoke,
motion of machinery, and hurrying to and fro of
workmen and sailors; the most dense and varied
life to be seen in any great port. Except that
when you come to the great bend in the Thames,







<pb n=61>



and begin to observe that you have never before
traversed so great a distance between vessels, and
still seen just on turning in a new direction, masts
and sails, as far as the eye can reach; <emph>then</emph> indeed
you feel keenest amazement. But it is still more
so when you grasp the idea that beyond these
masts and sails, beyond these lofty walls, which
extend along the two banks, there are more forests
of vessels, dense, deep, and confused; on the left,
the great basins of the West India Docks, which
cover an area of two hundred and fifty acres; on
the right, the great Commercial and Surrey Docks,
which extend several miles inland. We are no
longer sailing between two lines of vessels, but
between two rows of ports; and the eye cannot
take in the whole spectacle.
<p>After passing the Commercial Docks, we go on
for some miles between the lesser docks; but always through forests of vessels, black walls of
warehouses vast as cities, and mountains of merchandise. We pass before the glorious Greenwich
Hospital, and steam around the Isle of Dogs.
Already we have sailed two hours; now vessels
grow scarcer, and although warehouses, factories,
and buildings succeed each other without interruption, the port seems to be about to end. We
draw a breath; we needed a little rest, being
weary of wondering. So we go on for an hour,
already thinking of London as a distant city, and




<pb n=62>







of its bustle and noise as of a thing of yesterday.
When lo! at a new turn in the river, there are
new endless lines of vessels, new distant forests
of masts and yards, new huge docks, another port
and another grand spectacle. Here wonder changes
into stupefaction; you seem  to dream.   You
would say you were about to enter another London. You pass by the East India Docks, scrape
by Woolwich Arsenal, along the Victoria Docks,
which extend along the left bank for three miles,
and so on and on between walls without end, ships
without number, merchandise, machinery, smoke,
whistles, arrivals and departures, flags of all the
peoples of the earth, faces of all colors, words of
unknown tongues, which greet the ear from neighboring vessels, strange garments and savage cries,
which bring up to the fancy remote seas and
coasts. And now for three hours this spectacle
has continued! However tired the sense of wonder be, we must begin to wonder afresh. The
soul is lifted up, and no longer has the feeling
almost of humiliation which it felt at first, in
comparing this country to its own; it compares
no longer, it feels itself turn cosmopolitan; national pride dies away in a feeling of human pride;
it no longer sees the port of London, but the port
of all lands, the centre of the world's commerce,
the meeting-place of people of every race and
every clime; and while the eyes gaze on, the mind







<pb n=63>



traverses the continents and pictures to itself the
immense curves described upon the globe by
those myriads of ships, which meet and exchange
greetings there; the toils and perils infinite; the
perpetual going and coming on land and sea, the
eternal labor of unwearying humanity, and thinks
it comprehends for the first time the world's laws
of life. And, meanwhile, the vessel flies on, the
Thames broadens, the forests of ships now appear
only like vast beds of reeds on the horizon, lightly
gilded by the sinking sun; but still docks after
docks, basins after basins, warehouses after warehouses, arsenals after arsenals; London, great
London, is always there; London after four
hours' sail still follows us; on the right and on
the left, and before, wherever the eye reaches, it
sees still, with mingled doubt and terror, the
monstrous city toiling and advancing.
