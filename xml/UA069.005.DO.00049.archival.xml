 <p>The greater part of the accompanying work appeared some six years ago in a local newspaper.</p>

 <p>Since then I have been frequently urged to republish the papers in a completed form, but up to
 the present time, other duties and absence from
 England, have prevented me from doing so.

 I have to acknowledge my indebtedness to
<title>"Faulkner's History of Kensington,"</title> to Princess
Marie Liectenstein's "<placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>," to Sir
Charles Otto Trevelyan's "Life and Letters of

for the taste for the subject which the perusal of
this book infused into me when I first read it some

            A PRELIMINARY SAUNTER.</head>

 <p>IN these days of express trains and rapid locomotion,
 it is almost surprising that walking still continues so
 fashionable an amusement. But even walking has
 altered, we were about to say, degenerated. It has
 become, like everything else, fast.  During spring
 and summer hundreds of young men, armed with
 knapsacks and guide-books, disperse themselves over
 the country, walking frantically for four or five
 weeks, and return home with their boots worn out,
 their purses exhausted, and their heads full of old
 abbeys, ruined castles, peasant girls, and thirty miles
 a day. This is technically called taking a walking
 tour. Now we propose to gain all the advantages,
 without the discomforts of a pedestrian excursion.
 To admire scenery, to visit old buildings, full of historical memories, to peep into out-of-the-way corners,


<pb id="p.2" n="2"/>


and yet not to be late for dinner, to need no heavy
knapsack or cumbersome carpet-bag, to do but slight
damage to our boots, to require no guide further than
a good memory, and to find our purse scarcely lighter
at the end of our travels than it was at the commencement.
  </p><p>Our title-page has already divulged the scene of
our proposed exploits.  But that title-page, like a
German joke, requires explanation, and that explanation can, we think, be most fitly given in Kenna's
Kingdom itself. Let, then, those who propose to be
our fellow-ramblers betake themselves, bodily or mentally, to the capital of Her Brittanic Majesty's dominions, and once arrived there let them proceed westward (who, indeed, save some million or so of the
lowest classes ever goes in the contrary direction?)
until they reach the old Court Suburb, Kingly Kensington, where their fellow rambler is waiting for them
at the south gate of the Gardens. Here we would ask
our readers to step in, take a comfortable seat, say in
the Flower Walk, and closing their eyes, allow themselves to drift backwards, backwards to that remote
period when fairies gambolled on this island, a period

<pb id="p.3" n="3"/>

far beyond the historic era of Julius C&#x00E6;sar-far
beyond the time when the mythic Brutus engaged
in mortal combat with the giant race. Such a train
of memories will land us in the Golden Age, when all
men were brave and honest, and all women fair and
true.  Then there was no Tichborne Claimant, no
tobacco, no organ grinders, no competitive examinations, no tax-gatherers, none of the miseries of modern
life. All were happy, because all were contented.
The history of Kensington commences somewhere
about this period.
  </p><p>A little to the north of where the Palace now
stands, rose the dazzling domes and towers of the
proud palace of the elfin king Oberon. Clustering
round the dwelling place of their monarch were the
crowded streets and glittering spires of the capital of
the fairy empire. Its inhabitants were more in number than the leaves of the trees which now flourish on
the site of their city, while peers and princes from
every portion of the Fairy state thronged hither to
do homage to their sovereign. In the daytime the
citizens slept, and at night trooped forth to plunder
and frolic. Oberon had a beautiful daughter, heiress

<pb id="p.4" n="4"/>

to his vast demesnes, who was as straight as the pink,
as soft as the blue-bell, as fair as the daisy, and as
sweet as the dewdrop. The neighbouring town, we
are told, derives its name from this princess.  She
was called Kenna. Such a peerless maiden found
many admirers.  One of these was Azuriel, a prince
only less than royal, and the lord of ten thousand
vassals. He resided on the spot where now stands
<placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>. The dominions of another, whose
name was Oriel, stretched along the banks of the
Thames, and his wealth and generosity were boundless. The " cleanly servant," the " careful wife," and
the " neat dairymaid," received many a fairy vail from
his store of silver tokens. But Kenna cared for
neither of these suitors; her heart had already been
bestowed on another.</p><p>
  The king of the mortals in England at this time
was Albion, a monarch descended from old Neptune,
the sovereign of the seas. It chanced one day that as
Albion's wife and child lay sleeping in the palace, one
of the most wily of Oberon's nymphs passed through
the regal apartments, and at once bore off the unconscious infant in triumph. It became her object to

<pb id="p.5" n="5"/>

reduce him to the elfin standard of size; but in spite
of all her efforts, in spite of a diet of dwarf elderberries and daisy roots, on reaching manhood he was
a foot in height-two inches taller than any of the
fairy nation! Besides this advantage, his skill in the
tourney and the dance attracted the admiration of all
observers.</p><p>
  This was the youth for whom Kenna languished in
her high palace, maiden modesty forbidding her to
declare her love otherwise than by the silent language
of her eyes. But Albion, for the young prince bore
the name of his father, was not slow to read her downcast looks and blushes. His courtship shows how
much in these last two thousand years we have
degenerated in the art of love-making. Albion presented his mistress with dew-laden flowers, with ripe
fruit, with glow-worms, and with wren's eggs, and such
simple gifts found ready acceptance for the sake of
him who gave. Now-a-days ladye-loves reckon the
value of their valentines by the jewels which accompany the love-tokens, rather than by the verses inscribed on them. Albion even gave Kenna botany
lessons, nor does the little love-sick maid seem to

<pb id="p.6" n="6"/>

have considered them tedious. The lovers poured
out their souls to each other in such language as we
poor mortals can neither imagine nor describe. Their
stolen interviews took place at noontide, the midnight
of the fairy kingdom, when the " huge, wretched sons
of earth " alone are stirring. At this hour the lovers
sat one day "beneath a lofty tulip's ample shade."
(Tulips, we may incidentally observe, are not supposed
to have been introduced into England until some
scores of centuries later; evidently an error on the
part of botanists.)  Here Albion and Kenna plighted
their troth, and the enamoured boy had just sealed
the compact on her rosy lips, when, to their mutual
horror, the form of Oberon appeared from behind the
trunk of a sunflower where he had lain in concealment. A blast from the elfin monarch's horn summons his subjects to his aid; Albion is driven from
the side of the weeping Kenna, and the enraged
parent orders that immediate preparations shall be
made for the marriage of his daughter with Azuriel.
Albion and Oriel, the two disappointed suitors,
determine upon revenge. The first, remembering his
descent from the ocean god, begs assistance of his

<pb id="p.7" n="7"/>

relative, and Neptune swears by the Styx to overthrow the tyrant Oberon. In the meantime Oriel, by
a liberal use of his treasures, has gathered beneath his
banner half the fairy nation. Hearing of the powerful
aid which Albion is to receive from old Neptune, he
consents, for the purpose of mutual vengeance, to
place his rival at the head of his assembled forces.
The rebel army is set in motion to the shrill sound of
the cornpipe and marches towards the capital, its
rows of spears glittering in the air like a grove of
needles. The intention is to surprise the fairy
monarch in his palace, but the sudden dimness of
a magic ring warns Oberon of the approaching danger.
His legions are marshalled under the command of
Azuriel.  Albion defies his hated rival to mortal
combat, and with a terrific sword-stroke cleaves his
opponent "from the shoulder to the waist." But
fairies, it appears, possessed that same convenient
facility of re-uniting severed members of their bodies
which has been attributed to snakes. Azuriel in a
second becomes, like china mended with the Crystal
Palace Paste, as good as new; and before Albion can
recover from his astonishment, his fairy foe pierces


<pb id="p.8" n="8"/>

him to the heart with a sabre thrust. The unfortunate
lover, murmuring the name of his mistress, sighs his
soul away, and the rebel army become reconciled to
their king.
 </p><p> But Albion is not to die unrevenged. His expiring
groan reaches the ears of his ancestor, Neptune. The
sea-god in his rage at the fate of his kinsman lashes
the ocean into storms, mounts his car, and ascends the
Thames with the roar of the whirlwind. One step
brings his "towering stature" to Brompton, another
to the scene of the recent combat. Convulsed with
vindictive fury, the ocean-god strikes his trident deep
into the earth, and rooting up the whole of the fairy
capital at a blow, brings it down, towers, domes, and
pinnacles on the head of the two armies, crushing in its
fall all to atoms. Oberon, with some of his nobles,
manage to escape from this scene of desolation.
Haunted by the fear of Neptune, they seek the parts
of England farthest from the sea. Some hide in the
gloomy caverns of the Peak, others take up their
abode in dark woods and secret shades, and are
now visible only at rare intervals to mortal eyes.
Meanwhile Kenna, bending over the body of her

<pb id="p.9" n="9"/>

lover, fruitlessly endeavours to restore him to life. In
vain does she deplore her own immortal youth, which
forbids her to join him. At length (and here we see
the benefit of the botanical lessons) she sheds the
juice of a magic plant on her lover's corpse, and, with
the aid of mystic numbers, transforms him into a
snowdrop, the first of its kind.
 </p><p> For centuries the site of the fairy capital remains a
waste. But then the hamlet of Kensington which, as
we have said before, derives its name from that of the
unhappy princess, springs up. First, the princely De
Veres, and then Sir Walter Cope fix their residence
on the site of Azuriel's palace, and at last William of
Orange adorns the spot with his regal presence, and
Kenna is proud to see one of her lover's race choose
the Gardens for his home. The public are under a
mistaken idea that Mr. Wise planted the Gardens after
his own ideas.  This is an error. Kenna, unseen,
instilled the plan into his brain, and pictured out in
rows of yew the walls and streets of the fairy town.
To this leafy counterpart of her father's once glorious
capital, the bereaved fay still resorts on the anniversary of the day when her lover died. And here, fellow

<pb id="p.10" n="10"/>

ramblers, if you can but find the exact spot and the
precise time, you may yet see the beauteous Kenna
leading, at the head of her fairy train, the moonlight
dance in honour of her lost Albion.</p>
<p>      *       *    *    *    *   *
</p><p>  This true and authentic history is to be found in
what has been termed Tickell's " dreary mythological
poem," entitled Kensington Gardens. Johnson sententiously declares that the versification of the work
is elegant, but the fiction unskilfully compounded
of Grecian Deities and Gothic Fairies.  " Neither
species of these exploded beings," he adds, "could
have done much; and when they are brought together,
they only make each other contemptible." But this is
too sweeping a criticism. At all events Tickell might
have pleaded the example of Shakespeare, who
commits the same fault, if it be a fault, in his Midsummer Night's Dream.
 </p><p> Kensington  then  is Kenna's Kingdom; the
kingdom  which we propose to explore.  Let us,
still keeping our seat in the Gardens, proceed to
take a general view of our intended tour and map
out our forthcoming expeditions. Kenna's Kingdom


<pb id="p.11" n="11"/>

is a suburb of London in the hundred of Ossulton,
Shall we attempt to map out the boundaries of this
kingdom? Better not, for boundaries too often cause
debates and disagreeables, and the boundaries of
Kensington are as unsettled as those of Russia. Like
that country, too, it has tendencies to swallow up the
smaller surrounding States, but then the States, ask
for nothing better than annexation. With parochial
Kensington we have nothing to do; it does not even
include Oberon's capital-the Palace. We expect
that even Kensingtonians themselves would be puzzled to determine exactly what they mean by Kensington, and therefore we had better not attempt
any exact definition of the term, on which, as on
a great many more important subjects, people may
imagine that they all agree, until some unhappy argument awakes them from their blissful ignorance,
and they find that everbody differs from everbody
else. Besides, for us the question is not really an important one. We do not purpose making an exhaustive survey of the kingdom, nor do we intend dragging
our fellow ramblers into all sorts of out of the way nooks
and corners, for the very good reason that we are sure




<pb id="p.12" n="12"/>

our party would soon become wearied of uninteresting
trivialities and leave us to act as guide to ourselves.
We are not going to ferret out houses and names because they belong to Kensington, but shall rather
resemble the well informed tourist who carries about
sufficient memories of what he has read in Motley and
Schiller to make a stroll through Antwerp interesting.
The rest we may abandon to the ardent antiquary who
would not leave a single street unexplored, or a single
house unvisited which had the smallest of claims to the
smallest of archeological, historical or civic distinction.
Kensington has found such an explorer in Faulkner;
though the Kensington of Faulkner is as different in
size from the Kensington of to-day as an acorn is from
an oak. Our duties are less onerous, nor do we hope
to do more than to consider, perhaps from a somewhat
different point of view, the subject which our predecessors have treated. When we meet big men we shall
say a great deal about them, and when we meet little
men we shall say but little about them. Sometimes
we may feel inclined to recall to our minds the principal events in some noteworthy life, at others we may
have no wish or there may be no necessity for us to



        <pb id="p.13" n="13"/>

refresh our memories on these points. Living celebrities
we shall as a rule avoid, just as the ordinary tourist
cannot hope to enter Bismarck's house at Berlin,
though he be free to stroll over the Schillerhaus at
Weimer.   He cannot enter, uninvited, Tennyson's
mansion in the Isle of Wight, though he may wander
at will through the rooms of Shakespeare's house at
Stratford-on-Avon.
 </p><p> We certainly have passed by with lingering regret
the names and memories of such men as Leigh Hunt,
to whom the Old Court suburb owes so much; James
Mill, philosopher and historian, illustrious father of a
still more illustrious son; John Leech, and Thackeray
who would need almost a volume to himself; yet too
great proximity to the picture which he is depicting is
apt to make the historian as well as the artist produce
blurred and distorted outlines, and there is always
some difficulty in saying anything but good while
friends and relations still exist to feel hurt at remarks of
a contrary nature, be they just or unjust. Besides which,
want of material is often a serious obstacle. To this rule
we have made but one exception, and we hope both the
rule and the exception are judicious. </p>


<pb id="p.14" n="14"/>
<p> Why we have waived these objections in one case our
fellow travellers will see when we arrive at Holly Lodge.
 </p><p> We shall see then about as much of Kensington as
the ordinary traveller does of Malta in a few hours'
stay, or of Ghent in a six hours' halt on the way to
Brussels. But what we do see we shall see far more
thoroughly than the aforesaid traveller; once in a
house we shall ransack it from top to bottom, and
bring to light all the historical evergreens which
flourish in the garden, or the biographical creepers
which cover the walls. Such different memories, such
a variety of places, persons, and things, as our rambles
will present, will account for a difference and variety
in our thoughts and style. We may weep over the
death of Addison, and laugh over Sidney Smith's
jokes, make moral reflections on extravagance and its
results when we speak of <placeName key="Gore House">Gore House</placeName>, join heartily
with <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> in entertaining his little nieces and
nephews at Holly Lodge, sympathise with the little
sick Duke of <placeName key="Gloucester">Gloucester</placeName> dragging his big head up the
staircase at Campden House, or smile at Lady Deloraine pulling George the Second's chair from under
him. In short we are ramblers, not historians or

         <pb id="p.15" n="15"/>

antiquarians, though we may often poach on the preserves
of these more august and erudite personages, in which
case we shall, for the time being, endeavour to adopt
their manners and customs.
  </p><p>The derivation of some words is almost hopeless;
they are susceptible of as many meanings as a candidate's election speech or a Runic verse; and one of
these words is Kensington. We hope our fellow
ramblers will accept the Elfin derivation which has
provided us with a title page. If we can believe that
it was Kenna"who gave the neighbouring town its
name," we shall be saved a world of trouble and some
pages of antiquarian disputes. The name is spelt
Kensitune, Kenesitune, Kinsintuna, Chenesitun, Chensnetuna, and Kensington.  One learned historian
considers it to have been the " tun " or town of the
Cevesingas; another would ascribe the like honour to
a somewhat mythical family of the name of Chenesi.
Leigh Hunt somewhat sportively converts by a roundabout process this Chenesi into Cheynes or Cheyneys,
tracing this back to Chesne (oak), and chensnet or
chestnut, and certainly chestnut trees flourish abundantly
in the neighbourhood. But there is a regal flavour


<pb id="p.16" n="16"/>

about the more common derivation, Kingstown, from
the Saxon Kyning's-tun, which seems very appropriate.
  </p><p>In Anglo-Saxon times there was a most careful
division drawn between the King's private property,
and that of the nation. The first he could dispose of
by will just like any of his subjects. Over the second,
his rights were very limited, rather nominal than real.
But there was a third class of land, land which belonged
to the King as King, yet which, unlike his private
property, he required the consent of his parliament to
burden or alienate. Such were the royal palaces and
farms-the" cyninges tun !" And with this derivation
we shall rest satisfied. Kensington has certainly been
the abode of royalty, on and off, since the time of
Henry the Eighth, and may have been so even in
Anglo-Saxon times. <persName key="Swift">Swift</persName> christened it kingly Kensington; Leigh Hunt called it the Old Court Suburb.
 </p><p> But enough of derivations.
 </p><p> Let the curtain rise on Kensington eight hundred
years ago. We should see a vast tract of land, partly
forest, and partly marshes. There was certainly one
good road, but probably only one. This was the old



          <pb id="p.17" n="17"/>

 Roman way from Staines to London, which ran through
 Turnham Green, passed a little west of where Holland
 House now stands, then along Hyde Park railings to
 the Marble Arch, and so through Oxford Street. We
 should see then about twelve hundred acres of this
 land, some patches of it better cultivated than the rest.
 Some straggling vines would attract our eye, for our
 forefathers could not send to Spain or France for
 sherry and claret, but were obliged to be contented
 with what their own country could produce. We might
 perhaps observe a drove of pigs, watched over by some
 Saxon swineherd; for we are told by an old record that
 there was "pannage," or pasture, for two hundred
 swine.
 </p><p>The whole of this property was valued at &#x00A3;10, and
 even if we make allowance for the relative worth of
 that sum in those days, this will not seem an extraordinary value for 1,200 acres. As the whole population of Middlesex was probably little more than 10,000,
 the cottages in the district must have been few and far
 between indeed; perhaps there was one better house,
 belonging to that Edwin who held the Manor in the
time of Edward the Confessor. If so, even it would


<pb id="p.18" n="18"/>
most likely be a low one-storey cottage, built entirely
of wood, and roofed with shingles.
 </p><p> So much, then, or rather, so little, for Kensington at
the time of the Conquest.
 </p><p> At that time an important change occurred. Edwin
the Theign suffered the fate of most Saxon noblemen.
Perhaps he had led on his countrymen at Hastings.
In that case Norman William seized his land at once.
Perhaps he was ousted later, after the great rebellion
in <date value="1069">1069</date>. Be that as it may, Doomsday Book, in <date value="1064">1064</date>,
tells us that Aubrey de Vere held Kensington of the
Bishop of Coutances. The De Veres thus became
possessors of Kensington, and held it at first indirectly,
and afterwards directly, of the Crown, uutil Norman
and Saxon were fused into Englishmen, until the glorious English tongue revived by Chaucer, found its
fullest expression in Shakespeare; then, and not till
then, did Kensington pass from the hands of the
Starry Veres. They were among the noblest and
proudest of the old Norman aristocracy, a family noted
for loyalty, yet not unmindful of liberty. Speaking of
the twentieth and last of the old Earls of Oxford,
<persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> writes :-" He derived his title, through an

       <pb id="p.19" n="19"/>

 uninterrupted male descent, from a time when the
 families of Howard and Seymour were still obscure,
 when the Nevilles and Percies enjoyed only a provincial celebrity, and when even the great name of
 Plantagenet had not yet been heard in England."
 </p><p>  The house of Vere can boast of many names well
known in the annals of our country. One De Vere as
we have seen was a companion of the Norman Conqueror William, and had commanded a portion of the
invading army at Hastings. The first Earl, minister
to Henry I., had been ennobled by both factions during the anarchy of Stephen's reign. One of them was
among the eighteen barons, the leaders in obtaining
Magna Charta from John, and his statue is to be seen
in the House of Lords. They fought at Crecy
Poitiers, and Agincourt, in the Holy Land, and in the
Civil Wars of their own country. The ninth Earl was
the unfortunate favourite of Richard II., and is the
first Marquis known to the British peerage.
 </p><p> In the wars of the Roses, they joined the unfortunate Red Rose, and helped to seat Henry VII. on the
English throne.
 </p><p> The last Earl with whom Kensington has to do, was


<pb id="p.20" n="20"/>

Little John of Campes, so called from his residence at
Castle Campes, in Cambridgeshire. On his death, in
<date value="1526">1526</date>, his estates were divided among his sisters, and
by them and their descendants, what remained of the
Veres' property in Kensington was alienated.
 </p><p> The defeat of the Red Rose at Barnet was, unintentionally, owing to a De Vere. John, the thirteenth
Earl of Oxford, commanded the right wing of
Warwick's army, and during the skirmish his badge,
the star of the De Veres, being mistaken for the sun of
York, he was attacked by his own party. There
was a curious legend about this star; it was said to
have dropped from heaven on the shield of a crusading
De Vere. They had other devices too-a boar's head,
a silver bottle, a chair, and an unknown object, which,
to our unheraldic eye, looks very like a parish pump.
Their punning motto, "Vero nihil verius," that is to
say,-" Nothing truer than true or Vere," is as celebrated as their starry badge. It is said, however, that the
name is to be traced to a very different source, and
comes from the Dutch Veer, a dam. There are persons
in England now of the name of Weir, who claim descent from the Earl of Oxford, so the name may have
    <pb id="p.21" n="21"/>

only returned to its original signification again, after all.
It seems doubtful whether the De Veres ever lived in
Kensington. The site of the " ould house " there may
perhaps be traced in Holland Park, and there is an
Earl's Court in the neighbourhood, where they may
have administered justice.  In Edward the First's
reign they claimed the privileges of infangthef and
outfangthef, which barbarous words simply mean that
if Robert de Vere, then Earl, had found someone
running off with any of his goods and chattels, he
could have condemned him to death, and might have
strung him up to one of the highest trees that now
overlook HollandLane, had he been so inclined.
 </p><p> The De Veres have left few memorials in the neighbourhood, only a local name here and there. There
is an Aubrey Road, named, doubtless, in honour of
Kensington's first possessor, which consists of a few
quiet houses, that used to have a pretty view over
Holland Park, till the evil fairy, Bricks-and-mortar,
came, and, with a stroke of her wand, transformed a
rustic pailing and oaks and May trees into masonry
and ghostly poplars.  The growth of Kensington
during the time of the De Veres was but slow. The


<pb id="p.22" n="22"/>

Parish Church was erected in the commencement of
the 12th Century, and a monastery sprang up in
Holland Street, to the west of Church Street. Tradition
says that there was a royal nursery established here for
the children of Bluff King Hal. In the time of Charles
the First there was a vicarage, with a house and garden
and orchard, while <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, Campden House,
Cromwell House, and many other similar buildings,
began to give the place an air of some importance.
Then, as Kensington became a fashionable suburb,
houses grew rapidly. At the end of the 17th century
the Palace was built, and Bowack, the antiquarian
writing master, declares that even then the district had
begun to appear more like a part of London than a
country village. He considered it had about three
times the number of houses that Chelsea possessed.
In summer time it became a sort of inland watering
place for the Londoners, who crowded there to enjoy
the walks, air, and gardens, and to taste the waters of
a famous " Chalybial Spring, much esteemed and resorted to for its Medicinal Virtues." But the most
beautiful part of the town, to Bowack's mind, was the
Square, "which for beauty of buildings and worthy
    <pb id="p.23" n="23"/>

inhabitants, exceeded several noted squares in
London."
 </p><p> It would be difficult to gain much insight into the
doings of the good people who lived at Kensington
then, but one or two little items have been preserved
to us in the parish books. From them we learn that
the parish could not have been very safe, as the roads
were as dark as pitch at night, and we read of more
than one murder committed in the neighbourhood
about this time. Kensington seems, even then, to
have been of a liberal turn, for there are entries of
subscriptions for the French and Irish Protestants.
The bells of the church were rung on the news of all
the great victories, and in one case 15s. was paid for
faggots and drink. Some entries are of a surprising
nature: "money was paid for watching the trees in
the churchyard on May-day, that they should not be
cut," and to "theef ketchers, about enquiring who robbed
the Church." Who the thief catchers were we cannot
decide. Were they a species of private detectives, or
an early edition of clairvoyants ?  Fourpence was
given for a truss of straw for a poor soldier, and sixpence was expended on an almanack and tape. The



<pb id="p.24" n="24"/>

high road between London and Kensington seems to
have been the first place where glazed oil lamps were
placed, but the road was still wretchedly bad, and infested with footpads; and it was not until the end of
the last century that the single traveller could return
to London from a visit to friends in the suburb without
considerable risk of having to stand and deliver. Such
inconveniences did not prevent Kensington from becoming the most fashionable of the London suburbs.
  </p><p>It enjoyed almost uninterrupted royal patronage for
about seventy years. This is the heyday of Kenna's
kingdom, and during those couple of generations there
is a rich harvest of names and association for ramblers
like ourselves. Besides a constant supply of royalty
at the Palace, we have William Penn, Addison, and
the Foxes at <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>; the Duchess of Portsmouth at <placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName>; a host of celebrities,
clerical, poetical, and social in the Square, where
lodgings were almost unobtainable; the pathetic history
of the young Duke of <placeName key="Gloucester">Gloucester</placeName>, at Campden House,
besides a host of other memories. At Newton House,
died Newton.
 </p><p> When the regal period proper closes, which it does

      <pb id="p.25" n="25"/>

on the death of George the Second, there is still no
lack of interest.
 </p><p> The story of <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> leads us to the time of
the Foxes and the literary gatherings, which give the
mansion its greatest celebrity. The Palace still provides us with an occasional royal character, and the
promenades in Kensington Gardens obtain their height.
Smaller " lions " are numerous. " The " sights are the
Palace and <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>. Each of these will demand
considerable attention. The Church and the other less
important houses may be disposed of more rapidly.
With the Kensington of to-day we have nothing to do.
It has fine buildings and illustrious men, but the
buildings want the ivy of antiquity, the glamour of
historical associations, and as to the celebrities who
reside in them, what in the case of the dead is anecdote
in the case of the living is tittle-tattle.
  </p><p>If then we take the Palace as our starting point, we
may, having thoroughly exhausted its historical curiosities, saunter through the gardens to Kensington Gore.
Passing <placeName key="Gore House">Gore House</placeName>, <placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName>, and Colby
House, we shall find ourselves in the High Street.
Thence we can pay a flying visit to Kensington and

<placeName key="Edwardes Square">Edwardes Square</placeName>s, and return to spend some little
time in the church and churchyard. By passing up

ramble ends.</p>

We are going to-day among kings and princes.
Surely this announcement should be sufficient to
arouse our readers' attention.  We may talk and
write democratically if we like, but we are worshippers
of royalty none the less for all our prating and
scribbling. The staunchest democrat from the other
side of the Atlantic feels never so proud as when he
attends a royal levee. The burgomaster of Winkelheim talks slightingly of kings and queens to his
neighbours in private, and professes that they are no
better, nay rather worse than other folk. But the
worthy theorist will turn hot and cold and feel his
heart in a flutter when his majesty condescendingly




<pb id="p.28" n="28"/>
addresses a few words to him, on the unveiling of the
great War Denkmal. People affect to grumble because
history deals so much with royalty, but when history
takes up other matters and styles itself sociology,
they style it dry. The chroniclers, indeed, have left us
full accounts of what the great people did, and very
little at all of what the common people (who indeed
as is well known, were only invented to support the
former) did. The court life is the only life of which in
many centuries we have any accurate idea, and it is
better that the annalists should have described it
than have left no description at all, though we
would willingly barter half the banquets and "tourneys" in Froissart, Monstrelet, Fabian or Hall, for a
glimpse into the home life of Gobin Agace or of Wat
the Tyler. This long digression, however, is apropos
of the fact that to-day we purpose rambling about
the "regal glory" of Kenna's Kingdom, Kensington
Palace, and so without more ado let us leave our seat
in the Flower Walk and wend our way along the
Broad Walk thronged with nursemaids and perambulators until we are opposite the Palace. Now we must
ask you to close your eyes for a second. You can


         <pb id="p.29" n="29"/>

imagine us saying "Hi, presto, change!" Open your
eyes again. What a transformation! The Broad Walk
is still under our feet, it is true, but the Round Pond
has vanished. In its place is a straight avenue of trees,
and a formal carriage drive, cutting the Broad Walk
at right angles, and leading towards London. Turn
your eyes in the direction of Bayswater. Between
the spot where the Palace now stands and the High
Street of Notting Hill, is a wild, untidy gravel pit.
Now look toward Kensington. Just behind us a
building is in course of erection; a substantial red
brick mansion, at present veiled in scaffolding. Do
you not ask, like the awakened sleeper in the Eastern
tale. "Where am I?" Fellow Rambler, you are in
Kensington Gardens, as they appeared in the year
<date value="1690">1690</date>, and the unfinished building behind you is the
Earl of Nottingham's house, recently purchased as a
royal palace, by our Dutch monarch and deliverer,
King William the Third. But our fancy has carried
us too far. We must return to sober facts, and trace
the history of the Palace to its commencement.
</p><p>  We have already alluded to the tradition of the
nursery that Henry VIII. established in Kensington



<pb id="p.30" n="30"/>

for his children. Perhaps the little Prince Edward
may have passed some of his childish hours in the Old
Court Suburb, playing with his sister, afterwards the
good Queen Bess. Henry's eldest daughter, too, may
have spent here some portion of her childhood; unfortunate and unhappy even then, we may be sure, and
swayed doubtless by that weakmindedness and by
that bigotry which afterwards earned her, somewhat
unjustly, the fearful title of the Bloody Queen. We
know not when the baby-house was broken up. But
there were no baby princes or princesses for more
than half-a-century, so the nursery became useless.
The ground on which it stood was most likely granted
on leases from one courtier to another, and, about the
middle of the seventeenth century, came into the possession of the Finches, Earls of Nottingham.
 </p><p> The Finches are well known in history. One of
their ancestors had been amongst the most servile instruments of the despotic Charles the First. But the
Finches who lived at Kensington were much more
honourable than their kinsman. The first of them,
Heneage Finch, had become successively Attorney General, Lord Keeper, Lord Chancellor, Baron Finch,

       <pb id="p.31" n="31"/>

and Earl of Nottingham. These dignities descended
to his son Daniel. The second Earl of Nottingham
inherited not only the dignities but also the talents of
his father. Like him he pleaded eloquently. Like
him he was distinguished as a statesman. Like him
too, he was a Tory and a High Churchman. His
younger brother, who bore the name of his father,
Heneage Finch, and who afterwards became the third
Earl, possessed the family qualities and the family
predilections and prejudices in an equal, if not in a
greater degree.  His conduct as counsel for the
Crown at the trial of Lord Russell, had shown that he
was not deficient in that hereditary oratory which had
distinguished his father and his brother, but he displayed at the same time too much of party rancour.
His defence of the seven bishops in the following
reign was equally eloquent and more honourable. He
was, in fact, one of the first of those ministers whom
James, in his mad attempt to force the Roman
Catholic religion on the country, thought fit to dismiss from his service.
   </p><p>But these three " Finches of the Grove" were distinguished in more ways than one. They are termed,











<pb id="p.32" n="32"/>

somewhat happily, by a writer of George the Second's
reign, the " black funeral Finches."
  </p><p>The epithet needs some explanation. Finch number
one suffered from hypochondriasis. Finch number two
was almost as black as a nigger, and the general expression of his countenance was that of chief mourner
at a funeral. He was nick-named Dismal, or Don
Dismallo. He was
              <quote rend="blockquote">" The sober Earl of Nottinghame,
              From sober sire descended."</quote>

 </p><p> His son, whom we have not mentioned above,
because he holds no place in the annals of Kensington,
so much resembled his father that he was appropriately
called the Chimney Sweep.
 </p><p> Such were the first inhabitants of <placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName>,
or rather of that portion of it which was then standing;
the original edifice consisting only of the north-west
part of the present building. There were only about
15 acres of grounds belonging to the estate, in the
time of the first earl; but these were increased by a
grant afterwards made to his second son, Heneage,
out of Hyde Park. Hyde Park, we may mention,
incidentally, then extended as far as the Broad Walk.

             <pb id="p.33" n="33"/>

 Before we take leave of the Earl, however, we think we
 ought to mention that it was he who during the reign
 of <persName key="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</persName>, in a debate in the House of Peers at
 which the Queen was present, suggested that she might
 live long enough to lose the use of her faculties, and
 not know what she did, and the consequent necessity of
 some one to look after her.
</p><p> Adieu then, ungallant earl, nick-named Dismal; we
 have no longer need of you. To quote a vile pun of
 the period, and which deserves to be quoted only on
 account of its exceeding vileness, you are "Not in
 the game."
 </p><p>Turn we now to Kensington's first kingly inhabitant. This was the Dutchman, William the Third.
 King James had been driven from the country, because he was no longer fit to govern a free nation.
 King William had been sent for to take his place;
 and had accordingly installed himself at Whitehall. But
 the smoke of London aggravated his constitutional
 asthma. He grew so ill that it was thought he could
 scarcely survive the year. At first he took up his
 residence at Hampton Court. But in that age of
no-trains, and bad roads, Hampton Court was inconveniently












<pb id="p.34" n="34"/>
remote from London. The King turned his
eyes towards Kensington. <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> caught his
fancy, and he took up his abode there for a few weeks.
But for some reason, <placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName> was deemed
more suitable, and, in <date value="1690">1690</date>, the substantial birdcage
of the Finches was sold by " Dismal " to his sovereign
for eighteen thousand pounds. Then the Dutch king
commenced to turn the suburban villa of the English nobleman into the Dutch idea of what a palace should be.
The gardens were laid out as if they had been designed
by a citizen of Laputa, and as if the eccentricities of
compass and rule afforded a finer pattern than nature
could offer. Old holly and yew trees assumed the
forms of lions and unicorns, ducks and drakes, cocks
and hens, dragons, tigers, and basilisks. The building, the enlargements of which are said to have been
made from designs by Sir Christopher Wren, progressed, too, though not with such rapidity as the
king desired. The names of two of the workmen have
been handed down to us; for they lost their lives while
employed on it.  The parish books tell us how
"Richard Yates, carpenter," was killed by the falling
of part of the king's new building at Nottingham



          <pb id="p.35" n="35"/>

House; and how" Robert Haynes, a plumber," fell off
a scaffold while at work on the same edifice. Yet,
after all, the new palace presented, as indeed it still
presents, anything but a palatial appearance. Evelyn,
in his diary, says he went to see it, and tells us that it
was "but yet a patch'd building," though he adds,
"but with the garden, however, it is a very sweete
villa, having to it the Park, and a straightway through
the Park." Before the alterations were finished, William set out for Ireland, and the work of superintending them was left to his wife, Mary. William seems
to have dreaded the thoughts of spending another
winter in London, and was well aware that his subjects
would be greatly disappointed if he left the capital and
resided permanently at Hampton Court. In all his
letters, he urges the necessity of haste. Mary, loving
wife as she was, did what she could to comply with his
wishes, but in vain. Paint will smell, even though it
adorn the walls of a royal bedroom. The queen was
continually begging for pardon, because the paint
would not dry, or the plastering would not be ready.
This correspondence presents us with a quaint view of
how king and queen got on together. She always ex

<pb id="p.36" n="36"/>
cusing delays which she could not prevent, he roughly
blaming her for the faults of others. We subjoin one
letter as a specimen.  We are aware that reading
epistolary documents is fearfully boring, but as we
have had to bear it ourselves, we think it but right to
inflict just a taste of it on our fellow pilgrims. The
letter too, is amusing, remembering that it was written
by a Queen of England to her sovereign lord. It is
also curious as a specimen of a lady's orthography in
those days.</p><p>
                  </p><p>        " <date value="1690-07-25">July 25th,1690</date>, (O.S.)
 </p><p> "The outside of the house (<placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName>) is
the fiddling work, which takes up more time than one
can imagine; and while the schafolds are up, the
windows must be boarded up, but as soon as this is
done your own apartment may be finished; and
though mine cannot possibly be ready yet awhile, I
have found a way, if you please, which is, that I may
make use of lord Portland's, and he ly in some other
rooms; we may ly in your chamber, and I go throw
the coucill room down, or els dress me there; and as
I suppose your business will bring you often to town,
so I must take such time to see company here; and

            <pb id="p.37" n="37"/>

that part of the family which can't come there, must
stay here; for its no matter what inconvenience any
els suffers for your dear sake. I think this way the
only one yourself will have, will be my lying in your
chamber, which you know I can make as easy to you
as may be.
 </p><p> Our being there will certainly forward the work
My greatest fear is for your closets here; but if you
consider how much sooner you come back (from Ireland) than one durst have hoped you will forgive me,
and I can't but be extreme glad to be deceived."
  </p><p>To this dutiful letter, William, who, says a pasquinade of the time, was "a churle to his wife," made a savage reply. With what a strange picture of regal
domestic economy does it not present us. Instead of
king and queen we can more easily imagine the correspondents to be some city merchant and his wife, his
having " business in town," for instance, and the necessity of looking after the workmen. The king returned
in September, and received at Kensington the thanks
of the capital, for the victory of the Boyne.
 </p><p> The characters of the new master and mistress of
<placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName> have been very differently drawn.



<pb id="p.38" n="38"/>

There are, in fact, two sides to that of William. Regarded from the sphere of European politics, he was
the youthful hero who had saved his own country from
the might of France, and had rescued England from the
tyranny, folly, and bigotry of James; who was a very
Cid on the battle field, a very Richelieu at the council
table, the soul of a vast European coalition against the
grasping Louis the Fourteenth, who, even when worn
out with failure and sickness, never gave in, who with
a weak body, harassed by mental anxiety and by
physical pain, was more self-possessed on the battle
field than in the drawing room, who was the assertor
of religious toleration and the deadly opponent of
tyranny.
 </p><p> He was patient, long-suffering, and forgave the
traitors who conspired against him as frequently as
they forgot his forgiveness, and repeated the offence.
His mind was immense, his views wide and far-seeing;
too extensive and anticipatory indeed for our insular
prejudices. To him defeat meant necessity for increased action. Like Charles XII. of Sweden, he would
not know when he was beaten.  He towers in intellectual superiority above the other monarchs of his



             <pb id="p.39" n="39"/>

age, and England was better governed and happier under his rule than she had been for centuries, while if any
little hitches arose between king and people, it was in
consequence of his ignorance of our peculiar British
idiosyncracies, rather than from any fault of character.
 </p><p> Great men frequently appear less favourably in their
domestic than in their public life. The poet who
writes so charmingly of love and conjugal happiness,
may storm at his wife because the beef is overdone,
and the Parson may descend from the pulpit, where he
has so eloquently discoursed on forbearance and
brotherly love, to blow up the old verger for leaving
the vestry door open and causing a draught. As yet
we have spoken of <persName key="William of Orange">William of Orange</persName> as the liberator
of our country from bigoted tyranny, the scourge of
France, the wisest of statesmen.
 </p><p> Such is the William of history, the William whom
<persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> has portrayed for us. "Little Will," says
Prior, "no godhead, but the first of men."
 </p><p> Such, however, was not the William of whom we
have to speak as the possessor of <placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName>.
He was a small, thin man, ghastly pale, troubled with
a continual cough, with a beak-like nose, and sharp











<pb id="p.40" n="40"/>
piercing eye; a man who spoke but seldom, and who
when he did speak, usually said something unpleasant,
who was apparently unkind, unfaithful and rude to his
wife, who quarrelled with her relations, who could find
nothing better to amuse him in England than to endeavour to make his residences as un-English as possible; who cared for no one unless they were Dutchmen, who had probably never read a line of Dryden,
who used to sit up late at night drinking gin, and who
wasted British lands on foreign favourites and mistresses.
 </p><p> The character of his wife has been painted with no
less diversity, and fortunately it is the brighter side of
that character which belongs to <placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName>.
In history, we find her spoken of as a daughter who
helped to turn her father from the throne, who was
harsh to her sister, and who attempted to cover the
birth of her brother with unfounded disgrace. But
as we see her at Kensington she is the true loving
wife, adoring a husband who was, to say the least of
it, ungracious, forgiving him, or rather, scarcely conscious that he had faults to forgive, watching his every
movement, studious to attend to his slightest wish,




           <pb id="p.41" n="41"/>

never faltering a moment where he was concerned,
undesirous of the richest bauble that earth can offer, a
crown, unless he too might share it with her; always
loving, always longing for that love to be fully returned. Surely truer, better, more loveable character
is not to be found among England's queens. Her life,
indeed, was one of those romances so often to be met
with in history. There are materials for any number
of three volume novels in it. Ay, and the true history
would be more exciting, and more readable than all
the novels. If it were known how much of romance
there is in history, we should have boarding school
misses hiding <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> under their pillows instead of
Miss Braddon, while Ouida would be voted as dull as
ditch water when compared with Froude, and "Pascarel" would be set by stern governesses for pupils to
copy when they had been unusually troublesome. But
there; we have been exercising our rambling propensities too freely, and must return to the household
at the Palace.
</p><p>  Mary used to have her nephew, the little Duke of
<placeName key="Gloucester">Gloucester</placeName>, the only surviving son of the princess
Anne, over sometimes from Campden House. He




<pb id="p.42" n="42"/>
took much pleasure in watching the workmen engaged at the alterations. The Queen had a little tool
chest made for him, which cost &#x00A3;20. But she and
her sister Anne never met. Mary seems to have filled
the Palace with nick-nacks of all sorts. It was she
who set the fashion of china-mania, which has had its
revival in the present day. With the state-life of
the Queen, Kensington has no connection.
 </p><p> On the  <date value="1694-12-19">19th of December,1694</date>, Mary, who had
been greatly shocked by the sudden death of her
favourite, Archbishop Tillotson, a month previously,
became ill. Dr. Radcliffe, the same who had attended
the Duke of <placeName key="Gloucester">Gloucester</placeName> at Campden House, pronounced the disease to be small-pox. The Queen,
with a thoughtfulness that did her honour, at once
ordered every one who had not had that fearful
malady to leave the Palace. She sat up all that night
destroying papers. The next day she was worse. At
length it became evident that there was no hope of
her recovery. Then, at last, her husband felt the
worth of the treasure he must inevitably lose. His
fortitude gave way. "There is no hope," he said, "I
was the happiest man on earth; and I am the
             <pb id="p.43" n="43"/>

most miserable. She had no fault, none; you knew
her well, but you could not know, nobody but myself
could know, her goodness." Mary received the communion. She tried to take a last farewell of him
whose life was bound up in her own, but in vain.
William was led from the room in a paroxysm of
anguish. A few hours later and the Palace had become a house of mourning.
 </p><p> Greenwich Hospital remains: a noble memorial
of the love and reverence with which William ever
afterwards regarded her name.
 </p><p> After the death of Mary, the Palace must have
become dull indeed.  William cared but little for
society; and for English society least of all. The
English murmured at the manner in which their monarch chose the company of his Bentincks and Keppels,
in preference to that of their Earls of Dorset and of
Devonshire. But in most cases the Dutch were faithful, and loved their Stadtholder, and the English were
traitors, and hated their king. <placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName>,
too, was not the most desirable place for holding
evening parties and balls. The road from it to town,
which lay through the park, was infested with highwaymen.





<pb id="p.44" n="44"/>

 Some of William's visitors, returning from
his card parties, found that there were other modes,
besides loo and basset, by which money was rapidly
transferred from one pocket to another. In consequence of these occurrences, the road between the
Palace and London was hung with lamps, and bodies
of soldiers patrolled the park on the evenings when
the king entertained company at Kensington.
 </p><p> About a year after the death of the Queen, an event
took place which, though it belongs rather to general
history than to our pages, demands a slight notice.
This was the celebrated Assassination Plot of <date value="1696">1696</date>.
The exiled James still looked with longing eyes on
the crown he had lost by his own folly. Always much
under the influence of the Jesuits, he seems to have
been thoroughly imbued with their maxim that "the
end justifies the means." It was doubtless a good
thing for himself, and for the Roman Catholic religion,
that he should again rule over Great Britain. While
William was on the throne, it was evident that this was
impossible. The inference was plain-William must
be put out of the way. An agent was found to
conduct the affair. This agent was a Scotchman
              <pb id="p.45" n="45"/>

Sir George Barclay. He was furnished with a proper
commission from James, and was soon at the head of
thirty-nine other ruffians as bold and as desperate
as himself.
  </p><p>The first plan was a night attack on <placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName>.  The Palace was indeed but slightly
defended, and might easily be carried by assault; or,
more easily still, be set on fire, while the forty conspirators remained in the garden to see that the game
did not escape. Had this plan been put into execution and succeeded, a dark stain might have sunk
deep into the walls of <placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName>, similar to
that which colours the floor of the ante-room at
Holyrood. Kensingtonians, out for a Sunday's airing, would have looked up at the old building with
the same feelings with which country cousins now
look up at the Tower of London. But such things
were not to be. Fortunately for England, the stigma
of having murdered the man who had been the salvation of her rights and liberty was not to rest upon her.
The night attack on Kensington was abandoned, and
another scheme was proposed, to which the preference
was given. William's sole relaxation was hunting.







<pb id="p.46" n="46"/>

Every Saturday he was accustomed to set out by
coach from Kensington to Turnham-green, cross the
river by boat at that point, and enjoy his favourite
exercise in Richmond Park. The conspirators decided to attack him on his return. The day following
the festival of St. Valentine, Saturday, the 15th of
February, was fixed for the deed, and all the preparations were completed. Louis the Fourteenth ordered
the French fleet to be in readiness at Calais, where
James was waiting to embark, the moment the wishedfor tidings should arrive. But among the conspirators
was a Roman Catholic gentleman, named Pendergrass.
Pendergrass was horrified at the aspect which the
plot had assumed. Much as he wished for the return
of James, he was not prepared to turn assassin to procure it. But neither did he wish to betray his comrades.  He hinted, however, to Lord  Portland,
William's greatest friend, that the king would do
wisely to remain at home on the  15th; and when
Saturday arrived, the usual cavalcade did not assemble
at the gates of Kensington. The day was cold, and
it was given out that the king would not hunt on account of the weather. The plotters resolved to wait

        <pb id="p.47" n="47"/>

for another week. On the evening of the following
Friday Pendergrass had an interview with William in
his closet at Kensington, and, on certain conditions,
consented to disclose the whole plot. It may be
imagined that no hunting party left the Palace on the
morrow. The band became alarmed, and indeed
they had good reason. Before many days had elapsed
most of them were in custody, and in little more than
a month the principal conspirators had been tried,
condemned and executed.
 </p><p> The closet at Kensington was the scene of another
interview. It was here that Sir John Fenwick, who
also had been concerned in the plot, underwent an
examination.  Fenwick, in the hopes of pardon,
accused many of William's own Ministers of treason,
but William was by no means inclined to be lenient,
and forgave the courtiers in preference to pardoning
their betrayer. On a former occasion Sir John had
refused to take off his hat in the presence of the Queen.
The King had neither forgotten nor forgiven this dastardly piece of petty impertinence to a woman and his
wife.  Fenwick left Kensington for Newgate, and











<pb id="p.48" n="48"/>

when he again left Newgate, it was for the scaffold on
Tower Hill.
  </p><p>We are glad to turn to another visitor to the Palace,
whose doings were of a less sanguinary nature. This
was no less a personage than Peter the Great, Czar of
Russia, a man who, barbarian as he was himself, was
anxious to reclaim his country from barbarism-a
man who, Czar as he was, was not ashamed to labour
as a common shipwright in the dockyards of Holland.
The Czar's visit in <date value="1698">1698</date>, produced almost as much
excitement as that of the Shah in <date value="1873">1873</date>. Peter, however, was not so fond of appearing in public. He
visited William secretly at Kensington, and was let
in by a back door. The collection of valuable pictures
with which the Palace was adorned did not excite his
attention. But he went into raptures with a plate
which stood over the chimney-piece in one of the
rooms, and which, by means of some mechanical
arrangement, exhibited the direction of the wind. He
seems to have constantly visited Kensington during
his stay; he dined there; he supped there; and on
one occasion, was present at a ball on the Princess
Anne's birthday, when, too shy to appear publicly,





                <pb id="p.49" n="49"/>

 he hid himself in a closet, where he could scrutinize
 the company, without being quizzed himself. The
 same plan was adopted that he might listen to a de bate in the House of Lords. When he left England,
 he presented King William with a magnificent ruby,
 wrapped in brown paper!
 </p><p>We have mentioned a ball given on the Princess
 Anne's birthday. On the death of Mary, she had
 become reconciled to her brother-in-law. The first
 interview took place at Kensington. Anne, suffering
 from recent indisposition, and too fat to walk, was
 conveyed there in a sedan chair. The bearers did not
 set down their burden until they had reached the
 royal presence chamber. The door of the sedan was
 then opened, and the Princess, assisted by Lewis
 Jenkins (who, as we shall see later on, was usher to her
 little son), managed to alight. The interview was an
 affecting one. William afterwards presented Anne
 with the greater part of her sister's jewels.
 The King, when he was not conducting his cam paigns abroad, divided his time between Hampton
 Court and Kensington. We know but little of his
private life. He was fond of architecture and garden












<pb id="p.50" n="50"/>

ing, and imported as far as possible the stiff, formal,
Dutch style into our country. We are told that a
wooden model of Castle Howard was once sent to
him at Kensington for his inspection. One little
anecdote, probably belonging to this period, has been
preserved to us, and we are happy to say that it is one
which shows the saturnine King in his most favourable
light. It is thus given by Horace Walpole.
  </p><p>One of the King's secretaries was with William
rather later than usual in the King's private closet at
Kensington. A tap was heard at the door. "Who
is there ?" asked the King. "Lord Buck," was the
answer. The King rose, opened the door, and there'
stood a little child of four years of age. It was young
Lord Buckhurst, the son and heir of Lord Dorset, the
lord high chamberlain. "And what does Lord Buck
want ?" asked the King.
 </p><p> " You to be a horse to my coach; I've wanted you
a long time." With a more amiable smile than the
secretary had ever supposed he could wear, his majesty
took the string of the toy, and dragged it up and down
the long gallery till his little playfellow was satisfied.




<pb id="p.51" n="51"/>

It was supposed that this was not the first game of
play he had had with little Lord Buckhurst.
  </p><p>The King's physicians were continually prophesying that he could not last much longer, yet William,
in <date value="1702">1702</date>, had reached the age of fifty-two. Towards
the middle of February of that year, he had ridden
one morning into the Home Park, at Hampton Court,
to look at a new canal which was being excavated
under his instructions. He had just urged his favourite
pony, Sorrel, into a gallop, when the animal suddenly
stumbled on a mole hill, and fell. The King was
thrown, and fractured his collar bone in the fall. The
bone was set, and, regardless of the advice of his
medical attendants, he insisted on travelling to Kensington that night. The jolting of the carriage displaced the fractured bones again, causing him great
pain. At Kensington, the injured member was once
more re-set, and the daily papers announced that the
King was doing well. But it was soon known that
the accident had been productive of more serious consequences than had at first been imagined. At one
time the King grew better, and was able to take exercise in the gallery of the Palace. Here he sat down












<pb id="p.52" n="52"/>

on a couch near an open window, and fell asleep for
two hours. When he awoke he was much worse. At
last his critical state became evident; he was supported
merely by stimulants.
 </p><p> His favourite, Albermarle, had been sent for from
the Hague, and arrived at Kensington, travel-stained
and exhausted with his long journey. Before the King
heard the Continental news, he kindly bade Albermarle snatch a few hours rest. A great war was on
the eve of breaking out.  Once again, after little
more than four years of peace, it was to be England
and Holland against France. Albermarle brought
news that all was in readiness. Had William lived,
the annals of his reign might have been brightened by
the victories which afterwards crowned the efforts of
Marlborough. But for once he listened with a cold
car to the details of military arrangements. All his
answer was, "I draw towards my end." He bade
farewell to his Dutch courtiers, his only friends; and,
when he could no longer speak, pressed the hand of
Bentinck tenderly to his heart. The bishops knelt
and prayed. At that moment the clock struck eight.





               <pb id="p.53" n="53"/>

Almost before the concluding stroke, William had
ceased to breathe.
 </p><p> As soon as the lords-in-waiting perceived that he
was dead, they told the surgeon to unloose from his
wrist a small piece of black ribbon. It was found to
contain a lock of his wife's hair.
 </p><p> The Jacobites made merry over the King's death.
" The gentleman in black velvet," as they nick-named
the mole that had been the innocent cause of it, became a favourite toast with them. The morning after
the event rose bright and sunny. Such a morning,
said the people, had not been seen for years. A
Scotch peasant, as soon as he perceived the change,
exclaimed that he was certain the wicked king must
be dead at last. Such were the opinions which the
majority, perhaps, of Englishmen pronounced on the
great warrior and statesman who lay dead at <placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName>.  "It may," says Earl Stanhope, "be
doubted whether, at the time of his decease, there was
a single Englishman who entertained for him a feeling
of personal attachment." Posterity, however, has not
ratified the harsh judgment] of his contemporaries.
We are mindful of his faults; but we consider them as





<pb id="p.54" n="54"/>

outweighed by his virtues. He was no Englishman;
but he was a man; a great, good man, for all that;
and if we cannot regard him, as perhaps we cannot,
with feelings of affection, we must at least look back
to him with sentiments of gratitude.
 </p><p> Our rambling has taken us to higher subjects than
usual, but we hope the lessons we gain may be the
better, and the interest none the less.
 </p><p> We have not hesitated to occasionally assume a
graver tone, where we were speaking of graver things,
and <persName key="William of Orange">William of Orange</persName> well deserves such respect; but
we need not scruple to deal more lightly with his
successor, Anne, and cannot do her successor, George
of Hanover, better service than by speaking of him
as lightly as possible.</p>

</p><p>"WINDSOR CASTLE is a place to receive monarchs in;
Buckingham Palace to set fashion in; Kensington
Palace a place to drink tea in." So writes Leigh Hunt,
and adds that the reigns that flourished there were all
tea-drinking reigns. We, however, venture to think
that that of William the Third scarcely deserves this
epithet. Literally speaking, but little tea could have
been drunk, for " Tay," as it was then called, cost sixty
shillings a pound ! But <persName key="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</persName>'s reign, at least
as regards the Palace, was decidedly a tea-drinking
one. We fancy that chocolate was <persName key="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</persName>'s
favouritebeverage, but there is a gossiping odour about












<pb id="p.56" n="56"/>

her life at Kensington that makes " tea-drinking" a
very appropriate term.
  </p><p> On the death of her brother-in-law, Anne and her
 husband, Prince George, took possession of the royal
 apartments at Kensington with an alacrity which
 William's courtiers declared was " scarce decent."
 </p><p>  England had not been ruled by a woman since the
time of Elizabeth, and no greater contrast could be
imagined than that which existed between good Queen
Bess and good <persName key="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</persName>.
</p><p>  Anne was fat, slow, and dull, with an amiable face
and a kind heart, but with very little brains, and still
less energy of mind; a good wife, a devoted and
sorrowing mother, a warm friend, and a very lukewarm
enemy, firmly attached to the Church of England and
the Tory party, and above all, a terrible gourmand.
</p><p>  When in good humour, says <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>, she was
meekly stupid, and when in bad humour, she was
sulkily stupid.
 </p><p> Her husband resembled her in more than one respect.
</p><p>"If," says Earl Stanhope, " there were in England any
person duller than her Majesty, that person was her
Majesty's consort, Prince George of Denmark."



          <pb id="p.57" n="57"/>

  </p><p> In gluttony, he was fully equal to his wife, and cared
more for his claret and calvered salmon, than for all
the interests of Europe.
 </p><p> In William the Third's time, Kensington had served
the purpose of a regal town-house, for that monarch
spent much of the summer months in his own beloved
Holland. But in Anne's reign, Kensington became
the summer Palace, and St. James's the town residence.
The Queen always spent the early summer at Kensington, and paid it casual visits during the remainder
of the year.
</p><p>  She made many improvements in the house and
gardens. One of her first acts was to commence the
banqueting-room which stands a few yards to the north
of the Palace, and now serves as an occasional greenhouse. In its present condition it is a striking illustration of the well-known definition of rubbish-" matter
in its wrong place." A wooden shed or a temporary
glasshouse would answer equally well for its present
purposes. Standingamong the heterogeneous mixture
of plants which it now contains, we cannot but fancy
that the old niches, friezes, and cornices look mournfully down on the mud-stained floor, thinking, perhaps




<pb id="p.58" n="58"/>
regretfully of the gay crowds that once laughed, talked,
and jested within these walls, of the state affairs, the
coquetting words,perhaps even the whispered sentences
of love that may have stolen from the plumed and
furbelowed courtiers and maids of honour a centur-and-a-half ago. Poor walls, how the trundle of the
gardener's barrow must jar on their feelings ! with what
scorn must they, who remember the sword, cocked
hats, and ruffles of <persName key="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</persName>'s reign, gaze on the
walking sticks, chimney-pot hats, and scarcely perceptible cuffs of such stray adventurers as ourselves
who may dare to molest their solitude.
 </p><p> At each end of the banqueting-room are two small
circular appartments-one was a drawing-room and
the other a music-room, while the centre itself originally served for a ball-room. In fact the banquetingroom deserves its name about as much as the German
"banquet," which often consists of speeches, dancing,
and beer. But gastronomy was certainly more suitable to Anne's character than dancing, though that
exercise was once recommended to her as a cure for
her attacks of gout. In this room the Queen gave
concerts and balls, on which occasions the public were

             <pb id="p.59" n="59"/>

admitted into Kensington Gardens, on condition of
appearing in full dress. Kensingtonians will remember the alcove which once stood at the back of
Kensington High-street, and which we one day
missed, and at last discovered that it had walked off
to a more eligible position where it might enjoy an
uninterrupted view of the fountains. This alcove, in
the days of its youth, afforded a convenient shelter for
a lady who wished to adjust her brocaded robe, or
a resting place for gaily plumed promenaders overpowered by the weight of their hoops, periwigs, ribbands, and feathers. Even those who had no court
dress, and could not therefore claim admittance to the
gardens, were not altogether shut out. Hyde Park
was then bounded by the Broad Walk, and anyone
might peep through the railings and watch all the fine
"goings on" in the banqueting-hall and the gardens.
 </p><p> Sometimes the programme was varied by music,
and, D'Urfey, the poet-laureate of that time wrote,
"'Twas within a mile of Edinboro' town" especially
for one of these concerts. Dramatic performances,
too, occasionally took place here. The author of "Robinson Crusoe," Daniel De Foe, notes that "after the












<pb id="p.60" n="60"/>
Queen had built her greenhouse at <placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName>
she was pleased to make it her summer suppingroom." Alas, to what base uses things may degenerate!
  </p><p>The Queen's every day life at Kensington was a
strange compound of routine and excitement; of state
concerns and of court etiquette. Here she held her
cabinet councils, gave or took back the seals of her
Lord Keepers, and the white staves of her Lord
Treasurers. Here <persName key="Swift">Swift</persName> received his deanery, and here
the Duchess of Marlborough had her last interview.
Here, too, rolled on that unvarying round of court
ceremonies, so precise and numerous as to be almost
distressing. Fortunately Anne was fond of such matters. She could not dress without one person to hand
her her clothes and another to put them on-a page, a
lady of the bedchamber, and an attendant to help her
wash her hands, while it took the same number of
persons to hand her her wine glass at the dinnertable. Such a proceeding would certainly take all the
"fiz" off a glass of champagne; only fortunately that
wine did not become a fashionable beverage till more
than half-a-century later. Dinner was the great event




                <pb id="p.61" n="61"/>

of her day, she would sit with her fan in her mouth
waiting for the meal to be announced, occasionally
saying a few words and then relapsing into gastronomic
expectancy. The Queen dined at three, and fortified
by the meal, afterwards discussed state affairs, or held
her cabinet councils. Six o'clock on Sunday was the
favourite time for the latter. Pope's lines on Hampton Court apply equally well to Kensington    <quote rend="blockquote"> "Where thou, great Anna, whom three realms obey,
     Did sometimes council take, and sometimes tea."</quote>

</p><p>Only, as we have said before, Anne's favourite beverage was chocolate, which she took late in the evening,
just before retiring to rest. The Queen cared for
little beyond the routine of the court, and found
pleasure in this humdrum, monotonous life. Only
when engaged in card-playing did she cease to remember the little details of regal etiquette, which it was
her peculiar delight to see carried out to the letter.
When seated at the basset table, she was often so
jostled by the players that she could scarcely put her
hand in her pocket, and yet so absorbed would she
be in the chances of the game that she would scarcely
notice the indignity.











<pb id="p.62" n="62"/>
 </p><p> Anne was just the sort of person to fall under the
dominion of any one whose will was stronger than her
own. The Queen, in fact, was queen but in name. It
was Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, who managed
the affairs of the kingdom, and who regulated the
royal household. It was the Duchess of Marlborough
who turned out the Tories, and put the Whig party in
office, who gave away the places of sempstress to the
Queen, of page of the backstairs, and of royal coffeebearer.
 </p><p> Sarah was a very different woman to her royal
mistress. Rough, rude, over-bearing, of shrewish temper
and undignified manners, over-riding, or attempting to
over-ride, the noblest ladies of England; avaricious,
grasping, and heedless of everything that did not immediately concern herself; possessing an utter disregard for truth, and perfectly unscrupulous as to the
means she employed, so long as her own selfish ends
were secured. In a word, she stands prominently forward as the most unlovely picture of the fair sex that
English history can produce. Such a woman was
Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, and such a woman
she was both proud and pleased to be. In her published

              <pb id="p.63" n="63"/>

vindiction of her conduct she relates how she browbeat
the Queen, and how, on one occasion, told her royal
mistress "not to answer her ;" how she hen-pecked her
husband; how ill-mannered and rude she was to the
Court ladies, and with what lofty contempt they treated
her in return. When at last the Queen grew weary
of her, she declared that her Majesty-to whom she
owed everything-was the "most ignorant and helpless
creature living."
</p><p>  The Duchess was in the hey-dey of her influence
when her mistress ascended the throne. She was
appointed Groom of the State, Mistress of the Robes,
Keeper of the Privy Purse, Ranger of Windsor Park.
Anne, the Queen, treated her as Anne the Princess had
done. In their correspondence, all court etiquette was
laid aside. The Duchess assumed the name of Mrs.
Freeman, while her royal mistress signed herself, "your
faithful Morley," which after the death of the Duke of
<placeName key="Gloucester">Gloucester</placeName>, became" your poor unfortunate faithful
Morley;" Prince George was Mr. Morley, and the Duke,
Mr. Freeman. On many points Mr. and <persName key="Mrs. Freeman">Mrs. Freeman</persName>
disagreed, on one at least they were perfectly at accord,
the Queen was made for their benefit. She was a





<pb id="p.64" n="64"/>
mine of wealth, "a valuable estate," a bank where the
only investments were the sharp words, contradictions
and violence, by means of which the Duchess ruled
her easily terrified mistress.
 </p><p> Such was the state of affairs at Kensington at the
time of the accession of Anne. The war with France
commenced a few months later, and Marlborough was
placed at the head of the allied forces.
 </p><p> Kensington, of course, has nothing to do with Marlborough's victories; but it has a great deal to do with
the ultimate object of the war. The traveller may
hear on the banks of the Danube how the French lost
40,000 men at Blenheim, or he may be shown, on the
grassy plains of South Brabant, the site of the battle
of Ramilles. What a thrill of exultation passes through
our hearts as we speak of Oudenarde or Malplaquet!
We may, however, very naturally ask what did England
gain by all these victories, all this loss of men, and of
money?   Looking at the provisions of peace of
Utrecht, we find that the only substantial benefit
derived from the war, was the acquisition of Gibraltar;
and even that fortress may be considered somewhat
dear at the price of seventy millions sterling. How

               <pb id="p.65" n="65"/>

 then was this ? Why did not England reap the fruit
 of her victories? The answer is simple. The real
 conflict was fought, not on the blood-stained banks of
 the Danube, or the Schelde, but in the Queen's closet
 at Kensington.  As long as the Whigs remained in
 office the struggle would be continued, for they were
 for war, unless very high terms indeed were acceded
 to by the French king. The Tories were for peace,
 at almost any cost. The Queen was at heart a Tory.
 The Marlboroughs were Whigs. As long then as the
 Duchess preserved her ascendency over the Queen, the
 war would continue. That ascendency once gone
 peace would take place.
</p><p> Sarah, indeed, had begun to lose ground. She, her self, introduced the enemy. This was Abigail Hill,
 the daughter of a poor relation, a decayed City mer chant. The Duchess made her a bed-chamber woman
 to the Queen as an inexpensive means of providing for
 her. Abigail, who by her marriage with one of the
 Prince's gentlemen, afterwards became Mrs. Masham,
 supplanted her patroness. The conflict soon began in
 earnest. The first pitched battle was fought in the
summer of <date value="1708">1708</date>, not long before the victory of Oude





<pb id="p.66" n="66"/>
narde. Prince George lay ill at Kensington. He was
tormented with asthma; and as going up or down
stairs aggravated the complaint,both he and the Queen,
who was a devoted wife, had their rooms on the ground
floor. The Queen would raise him in her arms while
the paroxysms of coughing lasted. In order that aid
might be at hand, some of the Queen's bed-chamber
women slept in an adjoining suite of apartments. These
rooms, it chanced, had, at the time of Anne's accession,
been given to the Duchess, but never occupied by her.
Mrs. Masham was installed in the apartments vacated
by the bed-chamber women. Some rumours of this
reached the fiery Sarah, and she posted down to Kensington in hot-haste, determined to "have it out"
with her royal mistress.  Several skirmishes took
place at the Palace.  The result was indecisive;
but a different arrangement was made and Mrs.
Masham was given another suite of apartments " suitable enough for her grandeur." The Duchess made a
great effort at the time of Prince George's death, in the
autumn of the same year. Presuming on her privileges,
as Mistress of the Robes, she sent in a note, which the
Queen received while standing by the bedside of her

           <pb id="p.67" n="67"/>

dying husband, and which commenced as follows:Though the last time I had the honour to wait upon
your Majesty your usage of me was such as was scarce
possible for me to imagine, or any one to believe "  </p><p> At this stage, the Duchess made her appearance in,
as she herself confesses, or rather boasts, an exasperated condition. For once Anne acted as a queen,
and a stern " Withdraw," forced the intruder to leave
the room. In a few minutes Prince George had ceased
to breathe, and the widowed Queen stood weeping and
wringing her hands by the bedside of her dead consort.
 </p><p> The reign of the Marlboroughs was indeed nearly
over. The Oueen's spirit, weak as it was, had suffered
much insolence to pass unnoticed; but she now
rebelled against a favourite who sought to rule her by
fear rather than by love. Month after month Sarah
vainly endeavoured to obtain an interview, the fact
being that the Queen dreaded nothing more than
the biting tongue and fierce invectives of her former friend. But the Duchess seized her opportunity. She despatched a billet to Anne at Kensington, stating that she herself would follow, " and



<pb id="p.68" n="68"/>
wait every day till it is convenient for you to see
me, as what I have to say is of such a nature as to
require no answer." Without allowing the Queen time
for reply, the Duchess presented herself at the Palace,
and sat down on the window seat of the back stair,
like, she says, "a Scotch lady waiting for an answer to
a petition." At last she was admitted to the royal
closet, and Anne's first words showed how unwelcome
was the intruder.
  </p><p>"I was going," said the Queen, "to write to
you."
  </p><p>" Upon what, madam ?" demanded the Duchess.
  </p><p>" I did not open your letter till just now, and I was
going to write to you," replied Anne.
 </p><p> " Was there anything in it, madam, that you had a
mind to answer ?" asked Sarah.
 </p><p> "I think there is nothing you can have to say, but
you may write it," replied the Queen.
  </p><p> To all the Duchess's angry expostulations and attempted explanations, the Queen would give but one
reply </p><p>  "You said you required no answer, and I will give
you none."

                <pb id="p.69" n="69"/>

  </p><p>The interview lasted more than an hour, and
the Duchess, finding her immovable, left her with the
parting recrimination, "that she was sure Her Majesty
would suffer for her inhumanity."
 </p><p> The battle of Kensington, fought on the  <date value="1710-05-06">6th of
April,1710</date>, was over.  The fate of nations was
decided. In vain did the Duchess threaten to publish
her private correspondence with Anne; in vain did
the Duke of Marlborough throw himself on his knees
before the Queen. He was dismissed from his offices,
and was told he must demand the Gold Key of the
Mistress of the Robes from his wife. Sarah threw it
at his head.  Out went the Whigs; in came the
Tories. The war languished, peace was concluded,
and that stormy interview of one hour, between a
termagant and her mistress, did more to change the
destinies of Europe than the war which had lasted for
half-a-generation. Let us look reverently, then, on
the Palace, O Fellow Rambler, for here that great
struggle was fought.
 </p><p> With the exception of such squabbles the wearisome routine which composed the sum total of Anne's
life, was broken only by occasional visits to St. Paul's,


<pb id="p.70" n="70"/>

to offer up thanks for another victory, or to Westminster, to open Parliament.
 </p><p>  The Queen's consort, Prince George, died, as we
have already seen, in <date value="1708">1708</date>, and six years later Anne
followed him to the grave.  She had long been
troubled with gout. The  <date value="1714-07-27">27th of July,1714</date>, had been
a most harassing day. The Prime Minister, Oxford,
had been dismissed, and much state business had
been gone through. The Queen was carried to bed,
anxious and unwell. She herself felt that death was
at hand. "I shall never survive it" was her remark to
her physician. Then the whole Palace was in an
uproar. Both parties were taken by surprise. The
Jacobites in one chamber, and the favourers of the
Hanoverian succession in another, held councils and
plotted and schemed. The Queen was fast sinking.
The gout had flown to her head. But even while in this
condition state affairs must not be neglected. The new
Prime Minister, Bolingbroke, was suspected of favouring the cause of the Queen's brother, the Pretender.
The dying Queen herself placed the white staff of Lord
Treasurer in the hands of the Duke of Shrewsbury, a
staunch supporter of the Protestant succession. Tra
               <pb id="p.71" n="71"/>

dition says that Anne, with that heartfelt desire for
the country's welfare which she had always felt
murmured as the Duke approached her bed to
receive the staff, "For God's sake, use it for the
good of my people."  Then, thinking of the Pretender, exiled rather for his father's fault than his own,
she moaned, "Oh, my brother-oh, my poor brother !"
 </p><p> The Queen breathed her last between seven and
eight o'clock on the following morning, Sunday, the
1st of August. A few hours later and the people
were shouting for King George, of whom they knew
nothing, forgetting the poor queen who had won their
regard by long years of faultless domestic life, and
who, if she does not deserve the poet's epithet of great,
is yet certainly entitled to the name which her loving
subjects had bestowed upon her of the "Good Queen
Anne."
 </p><p> <persName key="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</persName> was dead. On that summer Sabbath
that was news indeed, however trite the announcement may seem to-day. Readers of Thackeray will
remember how Esmond came along the Kensington
Road on that memorable morning; how, " early as
the hour was, there was a bustle in the street, and


<pb id="p.72" n="72"/>

many people moving to and fro, and how presently
Horse Guards came from out the Palace Gates, with
their trumpets, and a company of heralds with their
tabards; and how the trumpets blew, and the Heraldat-Arms came forward and proclaimed George, by the
Grace of God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland,
King, Defender of the Faith. And the people shouted
'God Save the King.'"
 </p><p> If some three months later we were to pass through
the Palace gates, past the sentries, and walk under the
portico, and enter the gallery leading to the great
black marble staircase, afterwards so richly decorated
by Kent,-as Esmond's descendant, George Warrington, did years after,-we should find ourselves in the
presence of His Gracious Majesty, George the First, a
man of middle height, with a tolerably amiable and
rather pale face. He is dressed in a brown-coloured
suit, without any ornament, except the blue ribbon of
the Garter. On his head is a well-powdered flowing
periwig of large ringlets. This is our new sovereign,
just imported from Germany. We had to choose between King James and his Jesuits, and King George
and his German favourites. Of these two evils the

                <pb id="p.73" n="73"/>

second was decidedly the least, and Englishmen
received with thankfulness this most un-English of
kings. " His views and affections," wrote Chesterfield,
" were singly confined to the narrow compass of his
Electorate; England was too big for him. As an
Elector of Hanover, he might have passed muster.
As a King of England he was ludicrously unfit for his
post."
 </p><p> Well might Byron, writing a century later, exclaim:
     <quote rend="blockquote">"Oh, Germany, how much to thee we owe !</quote>
   </p><p>       *       *       *      *
  </p><p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> Who sent us-so be pardoned all her faults     A dozen dukes, some kings, a queen, and Waltz."
</quote>
 </p><p> We are not going to decide on the relative merits of
the kings and the Waltz-at all events the latter was
the more popular. Our ancestors would have been
satisfied with a king, but his German favourites, with
touching fidelity, followed him " to the throne of his
ancestors," as he called England, and received the reward of virtue in the shape of pensions, titles, and
places.
 </p><p> A regular German invasion took place.   " It was
with them," says Thackeray, " as with Blucher, one
hundred years afterwards, when he looked down from


<pb id="p.74" n="74"/>
St. Paul's and sighed out, 'Was fur Plunder !'" And
plunder they did. They came over in troops from
Hanover to the Land of Promise, and were popped
into offices great and small. King George had left
his Queen behind in the Castle of Ahlen, imprisoned
on a charge the truth of which is at least doubtful.
Her place was filled by two ladies, who had apartments at St. James's, but who must often have been at
Kensington. The first was Melesna von Schulenburg,
afterwards created Duchess of Kendal, who was so
stout that the English, who hated her as they hated
all the King's foreign favourites, gave her the nickname of the Elephant and Castle. The second,
Baroness Kilmansegg, Countess of Darlington, on the
other hand, was excessively thin and excessively tall,
and was popularly known as the Maypole.
 </p><p> And yet, after all, could the new master of Kensington be expected to do otherwise? He was old, dull,
and perfectly unused to English ways. What could
he care for people whose language he did not understand ? Lady Mary Wortley Montagu says he " could
speak no English, and was past the learning of it."
There was, it is said, but one Englishman at Court

             <pb id="p.75" n="75"/>

who spoke German; while at the Council Board there
was but one Minister of whom it is stated with certainty that he spoke French. The Prime Minister,
Walpole, used to consult with his sovereign in Latin,
and as neither knew that language perfectly, they
must have made a pretty jumble of it. The King
always looked on Hanover as his home, and no doubt
expected that some fine day King James would be
welcomed back to this country, and he, King George,
would have to pack up his traps and go. Remembering all these circumstances, we may take a more
favourable view of the King's character than we should
do otherwise. He was just, courageous, and moderate;
no hypocrite, and rather inclined to parsimony than to
extravagance; a kind master, and an honest man.
But he was insufferably dull and heavy, obstinate, and
in fact, anything but a king.
 </p><p> <placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName> did not see much of George,
though it was he who added the eastern front designed
by Kent. On one or two occasions in this reign,
however, a camp was formed in Hyde Park, and this
brought many visitors to the Old Court Suburb. The
first festival of this description was in honour of the









<pb id="p.76" n="76"/>

King's accession. The Countess Cowper writes thus
in her diary:-" <date value="1715-10">October,1715</date>. I was now at Kensington, where I intend to stay as long as the camp
was in Hyde Park, the roads being so secure that any
one might come from London any time of the night
without danger, which I did very often." This was
indeed an improvement on the times of William the
Third. To go "very often" at night-time between
Kensington and London, and yet not be robbed or
murdered! The "good old times" had even then begun to disappear.
 </p><p> Another camp was formed seven years later in
honour of the King's birthday. Pope, in one of his
letters, tells a certain fair correspondent that she "will
be infinitely delighted with the camp, which is speedily
to be formed in Hyde Park." In another place he
adds that "women of quality, and all the town, resort
to magnificent entertainments given by the officers.
The matrons, like those of Sparta, attend their sons to
the field, to be the witnesses of their glorious deeds;
and the maidens, with all their charms displayed,
provoke the spirit of the soldiers. Tea and coffee
supply the place of Lacedaemonian black broth.


                <pb id="p.77" n="77"/>

This camp seems crowned with perpetual victory,
for every sun that rises in the thunder of cannon sets
in the music of violins."  Meanwhile there were grand
doings at the Palace. Thither to the festivities came
all of the great company of the time. There might
be seen the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, with
his short figure and round, rosy face. Some of the
visitors were oddly enough attired. The Flying Post
tells us that the Bishop of Durham  "was finely
mounted in a lay habit of purple, with jack-boots, his
hat cocked, and his black wig tied behind him, like a
military officer."
 </p><p> In general the King saw but little of his subjects,
and as he had quarrelled with his eldest son and the
Princess of Wales, there was no one in the royal
family to brighten up the place. We look back with
regret to the days of that great man, "Little Will," or
even to the dull times of good <persName key="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</persName>, both of
whom, at least, spoke English. We do not like to
look up at the old Palace and think of it as filled with
Germans instead of English, of Mustapha and Mahomet, the King's two Turkish valets, taking the place
of our old friend Lewis Jenkins, and would rather hear

</p><p>IF we have met with unpleasant company in the late
portion of our last chapter, the prospect before us is
scarcely more inviting. We all know that if George
the First was very vile, "viler still was George the
Second"; yet it is not pleasant to be obliged to use so
much black while portraying our Hanoverian kings.
One of the principal duties of the historian is to erect
alternately monuments and gallows. He must be
prepared to raise a statue to Alfred the Good, or to
hang John the Detestable in chains; the one as an
encouragement, the other as a warning, to posterity.
 </p><p> But the duties of an historical Rambler are more



<pb id="p.80" n="80"/>

humble, and less responsible. To him a third course
is open-when bad characters cross his path he may
pass them by with a hasty jest, and raise smiles on
the countenances of his readers instead of frowns.
There are plenty of materials for jesting in the history
of George the Second and his family, and yet when
mapping out this portion of our ramble we scarcely
felt inclined for mirth. The incidents of the chronique
scandaleuse of the Court of George the II. are ludicrous,
but like the buffoonery of some poor lunatic, they
pain rather than amuse. There is so much heartlessness and so much corruption hid under the guise of
ridicule, that the anecdotes, ludicrous though they be,
provoke tears rather than laughter. The Court of the
second George was as corrupt as the Court of the
second Charles, and it was as dull as the Court of
<persName key="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</persName>. It had all the depravity of the first
without any of its gaiety, and it had all the dullness of
the second without any of its purity. There is a gloss
over the doings of the Merry Monarch which has often
blinded posterity to much of the iniquity of that age,
but the Court at Kensington in this reign appears to
have been just as corrupt as that of Whitehall in the pre


           <pb id="p.81" n="81"/>

ceding century, and yet to have gained none of the
pleasures which sin is supposed to bring in its train.
It was apparently wicked merely for the sake of
being wicked. Never, perhaps, has vice appeared in a
more petty and detestable form than it did at this
period. We look almost in vain for any touch of
natural feeling amid Court intrigue and Court deceit,
and forced at last to abandon the search, we turn
aside with a species of sickening horror.
 </p><p> The new possessors of <placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName>-King
George and his wife, Caroline-had a numerous
family, and some sketch of them is needed, that
Englishmen may see what sort of a household once
dwelt in their midst.
 </p><p> His Majesty, King George the Second, was a little
red-faced man, with white eyebrows and goggle eyes,
a man of low tastes and no intellect, unkingly in his
person and still more so in his mind, passionate and
avaricious, selfish and obstinate.  "He had," says
Lord Mahon, "scarcely one kingly quality, except
personal courage and justice;" and when, in addition
to these virtues, we have stated that he was temperate
in his habits, and had a natural taste for business, we




<pb id="p.82" n="82"/>

have said all that can be said in his favour. He
spoke our language fluently, but for England and her
institutions he had a contempt strongly mixed with
hatred. According to him, her clergymen were "a
parcel of black, canting, hypocritical rascals, silly and
impertinent fellows." Her ministers were, in his eyes,
"scoundrels, fools, buffoons, and choleric blockheads."
On one occasion, when the bishops had been untractable in Parliament, he declared to his wife that "he
was sick to death of all this foolish stuff; and wished,
with all his heart, that the devil may take all your
bishops, and the devil may take your minister, and
the devil take the Parliament, and the devil take the
whole island, provided I can get out of it and go to
Hanover."
  </p><p> If he cared for anyone besides himself, which is
 doubtful, it was for his wife, and well he might, for
 she was subservient to his every wish, and anxious to
 gratify all his tastes. If he got into a squabble with
 his mistresses in Hanover he detailed the affair at
 length, in letters of forty and sixty pages long, to
 Caroline, and asked for her advice on the matter.
 This single circumstance alone would lead us to doubt

                <pb id="p.83" n="83"/>

whether the severe verdict of Thackeray were too
harsh, that"he was one who had neither dignity,
learning, morals, nor wit-who tainted a great society
by bad example, who in youth, manhood, and old
age was gross, low, and sensual."
 </p><p> What could be expected of the wife of such a husband. Has not our Poet Laureate declared that
</p><p>
 <quote rend="blockquote"> "As the husband is-the wife is : thou art mated with a clown,
  <lb/>And the grossness of his nature will have weight to drag thee
     down.
<lb/>***********
   <lb/>Yet it shall be : thou shalt lower to his level day by day:
   <lb/>What is fine within thee growing coarse, to sympathize with
      clay."</quote>

</p><p>What Caroline might have been, had she married a
Prince as intelligent, as agreeable, and as anxious to
please as she herself was, we know    not. But this
we know, that the King's nature did drag her down
almost to the level of his own, and let this be the
excuse for those faults in her character, which so
sorely need one.
 </p><p>  It is, perhaps, questionable whether her ambition is
to be reckoned among these failings. To this passion
she sacrificed everything; nor did she make the sacrifice in vain. George might not perceive, or at least












<pb id="p.84" n="84"/>

would not acknowledge, that it was his wife's hand
that guided the reins of State which he held in his
own; but the nation knew, and were not slow to let
him know that they knew who really stood at the head
of affairs. Witness the following lampoon
    <quote rend="blockquote"> "You may strut, dapper George, but 'twill all be in vain;
     We know 'tis Queen Caroline, not you that reign     You govern no more than Don Philip of Spain.
     Then if you would have us fall down and adore you,
     Lock up your fat spouse, as your dad did before you."</quote>

 </p><p> The Queen's whole life was spent in endeavouring,
to retain this influence. She made it, according to
Walpole, "so invariable a rule never to refuse a desire
of the King, that every morning at Richmond, she
walked several miles with him; and more than once,
when she had the gout in her foot, she dipped her
whole leg in cold water, to be ready to attend him."
Another contemporary writer, Lord     Hervey, says,
"She was at least seven or eight hours tete-a-tete with
the King every day, during which time she was generally saying what she did not think, assenting to
what she did not believe, and praising what she did
not approve; for they were seldom     of the same
opinion, and he was too fond of his own for her ever






             <pb id="p.85" n="85"/>

at first to dare to controvert it." As the King
'neither liked reading nor being read to," and, indeed
is said to have been furious at the sight of a book,
the martyrdom of such conversations to an intelligent
woman like Caroline can be better imagined than
described.
 </p><p> The Queen made many enemies, among whom the
most bitter was Lord Chesterfield, whose epitaph on
her shows to what an extent hatred may point
satire.</p><p>
     <quote rend="blockquote">   " Here lies unpitied, both by Church and State,
        The subject of their flattery and hate :
        Flattered by those on whom her favours flow'd,
        Hated for favours impiously bestow'd;
        Who aimed the Church by Churchmen to betray,
        And hoped to share in arbitrary sway.
        In Tindal's and in Hoadley's paths she trod,
        An hypocrite in all but disbelief in God;
        Promoted luxury, encouraged vice,
        Herself a sordid slave to avarice.
        True friendship's tender love ne'er touched her heart
        Falsehood appear'd in vice disguised by art.
        Fawning and haughty; when familiar, rude,
        And never civil seem'd but to delude;
        Inquisitive in trifling, mean affairs,
        Heedless of public good or orphans' tears,
        To her own offspring mercy she denied,
        And unforgiving, unforgiven died."
</quote>
 </p><p> But Chesterfield defeats his own object, and we are

 <pb id="p.86" n="86"/>

more shocked at the virulence of the writer than
disposed to give credit to his assertions.
 </p><p> Against those lines may be placed the verdict of
a celebrated modern historian; that the "character of
Caroline was without a blemish."
 </p><p> We may, in fact say of Caroline, paraphrasing the
words of Hallam that, if casting away all prejudice on
either side, we weigh her character in an equal balance,
she will appear far indeed removed from the turpitude imputed to her by her enemies, yet not entitled
to much veneration.
  </p><p>Such were the new master and mistress at <placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName>. Their children inherited all the vices of
the father.  The eldest, Prince Frederick, is described by a contemporary as a poor, weak, irresolute,
false, lying, dishonest, contemptible wretch. One of
his sisters, the Princess Emily, was, we are told,
"lively, false, and a great liar; did many ill offices to
people, and no good ones. She had as many enemies
as acquaintances, for nobody knew her without disliking her." Of the remainder of the family, one alone
seemed to be possessed of any natural feeling. This
was the Princess Caroline, who was always dutiful

             <pb id="p.87" n="87"/>

to her parents, and who long cherished an unrequited
passion for Lord Hervey; that miserable retailer of
court gossip to whom we are indebted for much of
our information, and of whom we shall have more to
say hereafter.
</p><p> Remembering the characters of the different members of the royal family, it is not to be wondered that
disagreements among them were common; but never,
perhaps, has there been such utter want of natural
affection, such hatred between father and son, brother
and sister, as existed in this miserable household.
The King called Prince Frederick a "brainless, impertinent puppy and scoundrel." The Queen saidand it is a painful task to record that any mother
should have uttered such words of any son-"I will
give it you under my hand, if you have any fear of
my relapsing, that my dear firstborn is the greatest
ass, and the greatest liar, and the greatest canaille,
and the greatest beast in the whole world, and that I
most heartily wish he was out of it."
  </p><p> Nor was the Prince behind hand in similar compli ments. It was said that he openly declared that
 when he should come to the throne-which, for




<pb id="p.88" n="88"/>
tunately for England, he never did-he would have
his mother "fleeced, flayed, and minced." During
Caroline's last illness, this dutiful son was heard to
say, " We shall have good news soon; she can't hold
out much longer." And the King, in a similar spirit,
declared, on the death of his heir, "that he had lost
his son, but that he was glad of it."
 </p><p>  The eldest daughter treated her father as an insuf ferable bore, and when, after her marriage, that father
 was passing through Holland, and the Princess lay
 dangerously ill at the Hague, he did not even inquire
 after the condition of his child.
  </p><p> With such a King, Queen, Princes, and Princesses,
it may well be imagined that neither courtiers nor
maids of honour were possessed of much refinement or
good feeling.
 </p><p> A strange group, indeed, might then have been seen
at Kensington. There was Mrs. Howard, the King's
favourite, and bed-chamber woman to the Queen; and
there was Mrs. Claypole, the Queen's confidante. Sir
Robert Walpole must often have been there, scheming,
plotting, arranging with the Queen. How well <persName key="Swift">Swift</persName>

 </p><p> And above all, there was Lord Hervey, who flattered
and lied to the Queen while she lived, and then tried
to prove to posterity how bad she was, in his memoirs,
which, resembling those of Charles Grenville, recently
published, throw almost as much odium on their
author as they do on the persons he satirises. Pope
describes him as a reptile who

  </p><p> In one of his letters to Caroline, this court gadfly
gives us a jocular description of his daily duties. They
were such as brushing away flies, tasting the Queen's
chocolate, mimicking her acquaintances, and, above all,
talking a good deal of nonsense.
  </p><p> And how petty, how      infamous, how    spiritless, was
the life at court in those days! Here is what Lord

                    THIRD COURT LADY.
       Very empty, madam.

      We have had the finest summer for walking in the world.
                    FIFTH COURT LADY.
      Very fine madam.</quote>

 </p><p>  From this same Court Drama, which was written
   by Hervey for the amusement of his royal mistress,
 we learn that Caroline usually came down about nine,
 and would breakfast off a little sour cream and fruit.
 </p><p>  Sometimes, however, the interviews at Kensington
were more stormy. At the time of Walpole's Excise
scheme, the opposition determined to remonstrate with
the Queen on the measure-no slight proof of the
state power she was supposed to possess.  Lord Stair
was the person whom they selected, and the noble
lord lectured Caroline until she could stand it no
longer, and bade him learn better manners. "My
conscience," remonstrated Lord Stair. "Don't talk to
me about conscience, my Lord," returned the Queen




           <pb id="p.93" n="93"/>

"or you will make me faint." Lord Stair professed
to be satisfied with the result of this interview, and
informed a friend afterwards that "he had staggered
her !"
  </p><p>It was at Kensington that Queen Caroline generally
resided during the absence of the King in Hanover,
where George spent much of his time, and whence he
usually returned out of temper with himself and with
everybody. On one of these occasions Caroline had
ventured to make some trifling improvements at <placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName>, and had replaced some dauby oilpaintings by masterpieces of Vandyke, and other
eminent artists. The King was enraged; and when
Lord Hervey endeavoured to reconcile him to the
change, blurted out," I suppose you assisted the Queen
with your fine advice when she was pulling my house
to pieces and spoiling all my furniture. Thank God,
at least she has left the walls standing. As for the
Vandykes, I do not care whether they are changed or
not; but for the picture with the dirty frame over the
door, and the three nasty little children, I will have
them taken away and the old ones restored, I will



<pb id="p.94" n="94"/>
have it done to-morrow morning before I go to London, or else I know it will not be done at all."
  </p><p>The King was in an equally bad temper on the
following morning, and entering the gallery where the
Queen and her children were taking chocolate, " he
snubbed the Queen for being always stuffing, the
Princess Amelia for not hearing him, the Princess
Caroline for being grown fat, the Duke of Cumberland
for standing awkwardly; and then he carried the Queen
out to walk, to be re-snubbed again."
 </p><p> During another of the King's journeys to his beloved Hanover, the popular discontent became so high
that it was necessary to double the guards at the
surburban palace. It was on the occasion of this visit
that his Majesty narrowly escaped being drowned on
his voyage home. For some time it was very generally
believed in London that the reign of the second George
was over; and when at last news arrived of the King's
safety, the people remarked that " it was God's mercy
and a thousand pities."
 </p><p> It seems to have been about this time also that the
fracas between the Queen and her eldest son's wife
occurred.  The Queen was regular in her attendance

               <pb id="p.95" n="95"/>

at divine service at Kensington Chapel, and was
always careful to be seated in her pew in good time.
Her daughter-in-law made a point of coming late;
and as she had a seat on the other side of her Majesty,
was obliged, greatly to Caroline's annoyance, to pass
in front of the Queen--"a large woman," says Dr.
Doran, "in a small pew." The utmost that the Prince,
who was doubtless the instigator of his wife's unladylike behavour, would do, was to order the Princess not
to go to chapel at all whenever the Queen was there
before her.
  </p><p> The Princess of Wales was, in fact, the tool of her
husband, and is said to have been harmless enough,
and stupid almost to idiocy. She would sit at the
windows of <placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName> the whole day long,
and amuse herself with a gigantic jointed doll, nurseing and fondling, dressing and undressing it, greatly
to the amusement of the sentinels and any occasional
passers by. The Princess Caroline remonstrated with
her sister-in-law, and desired that at least the dollfondling might be carried on at a distance from the
windows, adding that the people thought-and in
this case with very good reason-every thing ridiculous



<pb id="p.96" n="96"/>

that was not customary, and such a proceeding would
inevitably attract a mob.
  </p><p> Her princely husband looked out of the windows
 of <placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName> to little better purpose. Stand ing there one day, and seeing Bubb Doddington go
 by, he remarked, " That man is reckoned one of the
 most sensible men in England; and yet, with all his
 cleverness, I have just nicked him out of &#x00A3;5,000."
  </p><p> The name of Queen Caroline does not figure in the
 death-roll of <placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName>, and we are glad it
 does not; for her death-bed was such a scene of
 mingled solemnity and buffoonery as to render it a
 fearfully painful incident.
 </p><p>  Shortly afterwards, Sophia de Walmoden, the king's
mistress, was installed at the Palace, and very nearly
proved the cause of its destruction. Finding that the
apartments assigned to her were damp, she kept up
such a fire that the woodwork caught, though fortunately no serious consequences ensued. There were
other rooms which she could have had, but, writes
Walpole, "the King hoards all he can, and has locked
up half the palace since the Queen's death."
</p><p>  Not four years after the latter event, Frederick,


                   <pb id="p.97" n="97"/>

Prince of Wales, caught cold and died. When the
intelligence reached the King, he was seated at cards,
and all the sorrow he showed was contained in his
answer to the messenger, " Dead, is he?    Why they
told me he was better."  Then, turning to Lady Walmoden, whom he had created Countess of Yarmouth
he coolly observed, " Countess, Fred is gone."
 </p><p>  Where the Prince's own father manifested so little
emotion, it was not to be expected that the nation
would be deeply touched; and the Jacobites celebrated the event in the following mock epitaph:               <quote rend="blockquote">  "Here lies Fred,
                 <lb/>Who was alive and is dead !
                 <lb/>Had it been his father,
                 <lb/>I had much rather;
                 <lb/>Had it been his brother,
                 <lb/>Still better than another;
                 <lb/>Had it been his sister,
                 <lb/>No one could have missed her;
                 <lb/>Had it been the whole generation,
                 <lb/>Still better for the nation;
                 <lb/>But since 'tis only Fred,
                 <lb/>Who was alive and is dead,
                 <lb/>There is no more to be said."
</quote>
   </p><p> Frederick's eldest son, afterwards George the Third,
  was now heir to the crown, and some years later the
  King offered his grandson apartments at Kensington,



<pb id="p.98" n="98"/>

but the Prince preferred to remain with his mother;
nor did he, when he came to the throne, honour the
old Court Suburb with his presence. Even at this time
the distance of Kensington from the capital was felt to
be an inconvenience. Prince Frederick had disliked residing there, and preferred St. James's.
</p><p>  Lord Hervey, writing in I736, says, " The road between this place and London has grown so infamously
bad, that we may live in the same solitude as we
would do if cast away on a rock in the middle of the
ocean, and all the Londoners tell us there is between
them and us a great impassable gulf of mud. There
are two ways through the Park, but the new one is so
convex, and the old one is so concave, that by this extreme of faults they agree in the common one of being,
like the high road, impassable."
  </p><p>The consequence of such a state of things was that
accidents were frequent. When coming from Kensington one Sunday night, the Duke of Grafton was upset
in a large deep pit.  The duke dislocated his collarbone, and the coachman broke his leg.  On another
occasion, as the four princesses were driving to town
from the Palace in a coach-and-six, they were driven




           <pb id="p.99" n="99"/>

into by a single horse chaise, and the coach was upset.
The occupants of the chaise were seriously hurt, but
the princesses escaped with a severe fright. They
postponed their journey and returned to Kensington,
where the fashionable remedies of that day, such as
Eau de Carme, Hungary water, Hartshorn drops, and
Eau de Luce, were put into requisition to restore their
shattered nerves.
 </p><p> These same princesses had, however, little care for
the nerves of others. On one occasion, Princess Emily
pulled Lady Deloraine's chair from under her, and even
his gracious Majesty did not scruple to be much amused
at her ladyship, who was governess to the Princesses,
sprawling on the floor. But George did not relish the
joke so much when it was played upon himself by the
aggrieved countess, and Lady Deloraine was at once
banished from the court.
  </p><p> One more event only remains to be recorded of King
George in connection with the Palace. It was here he
died. He was now seventy-seven years of age, and it
was noticed by the people that at the commencement
of  <date value="1760-10">October,1760</date>, the oldest lion in the Tower died,
and that the animal was about the same age as his





<pb id="p.100" n="100"/>

Majesty. It is not very clear what this had to do
with the King's death, but the circumstance was considered as a sure sign of his approaching dissolution.
On the morning of the 25th of October, George rose
at his usual hour of six, drank his chocolate, and inquired about the direction of the wind, as he was expecting the arrival of important continental news, and
the mails had been recently delayed. At seven o'clock
he said he would take a turn in the garden. The page
in attendance in the ante-chamber was shortly afterwards startled by the sound of a heavy fall, and on
entering the room through which the King was forced
to pass to reach the garden, he found his royal master
on the floor. The King could only gasp, " Send for
Amelia," but before the Princess arrived, George the
Second had expired. A subsequent examination
proved that the right ventricle of the heart had burst.
The poor Princess, blind and deaf, was not aware of
the catastrophe until she had bent her head down to
her father's face to catch the words she fancied he was
uttering.
 </p><p> The third George never resided at Kensington, nor
did his son the Fourth and last of that name, though




          <pb id="p.101" n="101"/>

it is his wife who is its next important inhabitant. Of all
the different personages who have each added some
historical touches to the chronicle of the Palace, she is
the one we would most willingly pass over in silence,
for her story is both sorrowful and unpleasing.  But
duty must be obeyed, and the ill-fated Caroline of
<placeName key="Brunswick">Brunswick</placeName> stands next on the list of the regal occupants of the Palace. She was the second daughter of
the Prince of <placeName key="Brunswick">Brunswick</placeName>, and was educated in a manner
more befitting the child of a travelling showman than
of an independent sovereign. She was self-willed and
high-spirited, but utterly without tact or discrimination,
while her mind, not naturally strong, had derived but
little benefit from education or experience.  She was
pretty, and in spite of her defective training, had
sufficient natural sprightliness to be witty and amusing.
  </p><p> Such was the lady selected as consort for the heirapparent to the British crown, afterwards George the
Fourth of glorious memory. The marriage was easily
arranged. Master Georgie had run into debt, and
papa at last refused to provide any more money unless
Georgie would marry and reform.  Making the best



<pb id="p.102" n="102"/>
of a bad bargain, the dutiful son accepted the money
and the wife, and set himself to get rid of both as soon
as possible.  There was no difficulty with regard to
the first, and within a year he had separated from the
second.  It was not until some time after this event
that we first meet with the Princess at Kensington
Palace, where she occasionally resided from <dateRange from="1810" to="1815">1810 to
1815.</dateRange>  The widowed wife divided her time between
the Old Court Suburb and Blackheath, and if we may
believe what the world said, that time was a gay one.
Her dinners at Kensington were of the most pleasantly
social description.
</p><p>  They were "marvellously heterogeneous in their
composition,' says one of her occasional visitors;
"There were good people and very bad ones, fine
ladies and fine gentlemen, humdrums and clever
people."
</p><p>  The Princess would chat about her domestic affairs
in the most free and easy manner, for she took good
care that there were no eaves-dropping servants in the
room to make reports to Carlton House.  Sydney
Smith was often there, and no doubt amused the party
by launching at the absent husband some of his sharp




               <pb id="p.103" n="103"/>

piercing sarcasms, in which the wife would be only too
willing to join.
 </p><p> Yet Caroline seems to have feared that it was all
cupboard friendship, " Unless I show dem de knife and
fork," she writes, "no company has come to Kensington or Blackheath, and neither my purse nor my spirits
can always afford to hang out de offer of an ordinary."
  </p><p> Her prettiness was leaving her. Lady Brownlow, in
her reminiscences, describes her figure as fat and
shapeless, her complexion good, her eyes bright blue,
but with a bold expression, caused perhaps by the
quantity of rouge she wore.
 </p><p>  " Her fair hair hung in masses of curls on each side of
 her throat like a lion's mane."  She dressed showily,
 ornamenting her gowns with gold or silver spangles,
 and embroidering her satin boots with them. "Some times she wore a scarlet mantle with a gold trimming
 round it hanging from her shoulder," the effect of which
 was strangely grotesque.
 </p><p>  Caroline, indeed, seems to have striven against any
 misgivings she may have felt, and at the same time to
 have endeavoured to drown all unpleasant memories by





<pb id="p.104" n="104"/>
indulging her eccentric taste in dress and by engaging
in the maddest of frolics. Scarcely any escapade was
too absurd or too frivolous for her taste. On one
occasion she received her distinguished birthday
visitors in a pink dressing-gown !  Sometimes she
would stroll through the neighbouring fields, even as
far as the Paddington canal, attired in evening dress,
and attended only by a solitary maid of honour. She
would enter empty houses, and make enquiries concerning the rent. In the gardens she once made the
acquaintance of two persons, and without letting them
know who she was, questioned them concerning their
opinion of herself, and finished by inviting them to the
Palace.  Nothing gave her greater pleasure than to
think that all these freaks would find their way, magnified and distorted of course, to Carlton House; and in
order to annoy her husband, she cared but little how
much she injured herself. She found but little pleasure
in pursuits of an intellectual nature; occasionally
reading aloud, or jotting down a few notes in a diary,
were the sum total of her achievements in this direction.
  </p><p>Yet we would not judge her harshly; better perhaps




          <pb id="p.105" n="105"/>

not to judge her at all.  Poor unhappy Queen ! who
can say how much inward sorrow, what bursts of secret
tears, what longing for domestic happiness, were hidden
beneath this outward levity and thoughtlessness?
Surely no woman can be separated from her husband,
and almost separated from her daughter, and not
grieve?  We know not what may have been her
thoughts          <quote rend="blockquote"> " In the dead, unhappy night,
           <lb/>And when the rain is on the roof,</quote>
        </p><p>      *     *     *    *</p><p>
           <quote rend="blockquote"> And thou art staring at the wall;
              <lb/>Where the dying night-lamp flickers,
            <lb/>And the shadows rise and fall."</quote>

 </p><p> Those passionate longings for purer happiness and
a peaceful life, which she must sometimes have felt,
may have spent themselves in bitter tears when all
was quiet, and the moonbeams were stealing in at the
bedroom window in all their solemn midnight stillness.
 </p><p>  Her excuse is her husband-a man who was pro bably the worst who ever wore a crown, and whose
 only virtues were that he was King of England, and
 that his clothes fitted him faultlessly.
  </p><p> Caroline did not reside long at the Palace, and thus



<pb id="p.106" n="106"/>

we are spared the pain of tracing her career through
the misery and disgrace that hang around it. Once
more, indeed, does her name occur in the annals of
Kensington; would that it did not!
 </p><p> On the  <date value="1821-08-14">14th August,1821</date>, a procession started from
Brandenburgh House, Hammersmith, bearing the
remains of" the injured Queen of England " to Harwich, whence they were to be conveyed to the family
vault at <placeName key="Brunswick">Brunswick</placeName>. The Government had decided
that the cortege should avoid the city; the mob, always
favourable to the cause of the Queen, resolved that it
should be borne in triumph through the metropolis.
As the procession attempted to pass up Church Street,
Kensington, it was forced backwards by the rioters,
and compelled to continue its march towards London.
At Kensington Gate a similar scene took place with
similar consequences.  But when Park Lane was
reached, the military, spite of barricades, spite of
showers of stones and brickbats, forced a passage
through the mob, and the funeral train trotted up past
the Marble Arch (then Cumberland Gate). But the
battle was not yet won. At Tottenham Court Road

         <pb id="p.107" n="107"/>

the mob assembled in full force, made a last desperate
effort, and drove the procession down Drury Lane and
through the city.
 </p><p> Little good or evil did the struggle benefit the lifeless dust which could no more suffer or inflict injury.
The story is a melancholy one, written in English
history as a warning which may profit while it saddens.
Her husband had his wish. His wife was gone for
ever. Of such characters as his the less said the better,
for all that can be said must be evil.
 </p><p> At last we have come to the end of the Georges,
and never did we take leave of a subject with a greater
feeling of thankfulness that a most disagreeable task
was concluded than we now do. Without every minute
circumstance of a king's court life be known, his
character can never be fairly judged, for no part of a
king's life is private. All the court tittle-tattle, every
hasty word, every trivial action, forms part of that
historic life which leads us into the very spirit of the
age we are describing. But we cannot but hope-and
in this wish we are assured our fellow-ramblers will
heartily join-that for the future we may meet with



<pb id="p.108" n="108"/>

more pleasant associates on our journeys than the
flatterers and court favourites of the reign of George
the Second, or the unhappy Queen of his miserable

</p><p>THE hope expressed in our last chapter was not a
vain one.
</p><p>  On the  <date value="1819-05-24">24th of May,1819</date>, Victoria was born here,
and here also did she reside until her accession to the
throne in <date value="1837">1837</date>. We are scarcely called upon to extend
our rambles on what must, for the present, be hallowed
ground. But traditions of the Princess still linger in
the neighbourhood. Anecdotes of her punctuality, her
activity, her early donkey rides, and her bracing walks,
taken in all weathers, might easily be cited. William
Wilberforce, whose acquaintance we shall soon make,
at <placeName key="Gore House">Gore House</placeName>, tells us of a visit he paid to the

<pb id="p.110" n="110"/>

Duchess of Kent, and of the " fine animated child by
her side with its playthings, of which," he adds, "I
soon became one."
  </p><p> The last scene we have to depict at Kensington,
forms a fitting concluding tableau to its long list of
regal glories. At five o'clock on the morning of the
 <date value="1837-06-20">20th of June,1837</date>, the Archbishop of Canterbury and
Lord Conyngham, the Chamberlain, appeared before
the gates of the Palace, having left the death-bed of
William the Fourth only a few hours before.  After
knocking, ringing, and thumping for some time, the
porter was at length aroused. Further delays ensued;
the attendant at first refused to disturb the Princess,
who was in a " sweet sleep."  "But," continues our
authority, " they said ' We are come to the Queen on
business of State, and even her sleep must give way to
that.'"  In a few minutes she who had the night before retired to rest Princess, was awakened to find herself Queen. "She came into the room," we are told,
"in a loose white nightgown and shawl, her night-cap
thrown off, and her hair falling upon her shoulders, her
feet in her slippers, tears in her eyes, but perfectly
collected and dignified." These tears called from the
               <pb id="p.111" n="111"/>

eloquent pen of Mrs. Browning the well-known verses
of which one stanza runs:

            <quote rend="blockquote"> "God save thee, weeping Queen,
               Thou shalt be well beloved               The tyrant's sceptre cannot move
               As those pure tears have moved;
               The nature in thine eye we see
               Which tyrants cannot own               The love that guardeth liberties.
               Strange blessing on the nation lies
               Whose Sovereign wept,
               Yea, wept to wear a crown."
</quote>
  </p><p>At eleven o'clock on that memorable day, the first
Cabinet Council of the present reign met at Kensington. The customary formalities were gone through,
her uncle's death was officially announced to her, the
proclamation was read, the doors of the adjoining
chamber were then thrown open,and the Queen,leaning
on the arm of the Duke of Sussex, entered the room.
She was in mourning, and plainly dressed.  She bowed
to the Council, took her seat, and read the speech prepared for her clearly and distinctly, while any little
timidity she may have shown on her entrance entirely
disappeared, and she remained perfectly calm and selfpossessed  during  the rest of this certainly trying
ordeal for a young girl not yet out of her teens. She

went through the whole ceremony of the swearing of
allegiance and kissing her hand with the same graceful
manner and self possession, occasionally looking to
Lord Melbourne for instructions. The only sign of
emotion she evinced, being when her uncle swore
allegiance, when, as we are told in the "Greville
Memoirs," "she blushed up to her eyes, as if she felt
the contrast between their several and natural relations."
 </p><p> The Duke of Cumberland was the first to render
her the customary homage, and " the Duke of Sussex
rose to perform the same ceremony, but the Queen,
with admirable grace, stood, and preventing him from
kneeling, kissed him on the forehead." "The arrangements, however," adds the same author, " were so illmade, that the scene of swearing fealty was more like
that of the bidding at an auction than anything else."
One only of the ministers who took the oath of allegiance at that Privy Council, held forty-three years
ago, still survives--Earl Grey, then Secretary at War,
who has reached the age of seventy-eight. Great indeed
have been the changes in those forty-three years.
Thankful may we feel that they have been for the








                <pb id="p.113" n="113"/>

 most part, years of prosperity and peace, for which we
 look in vain to any other nation for a parallel.
 </p><p>  As we leave the Palace and take a farewell glance
over the regal inhabitants who have passed under our
view, we shall look in vain for another of whom it may
be said, as it has been said so truly and poetically by
Tennyson of Victoria:
          <quote rend="blockquote">  "Her court was pure, her life serene,
            <lb/>God gave her peace, her land reposed;
            <lb/>A thousand claims to reverence closed
            <lb/>In her, as Mother, Wife, and Queen."
</quote>
 </p><p> Leaving the palace, our path lies through the Gardens. Their mythological origin which formed the
subject of our first chapter, is separated by a long
train of centuries from their authentic history. That is
at first mixed up with the history of Hyde Park, for both
parks are the remains of a vast forest, which in the time
of the Romans, was infested with wild boars, wolves,
and deer, and inhabited only by a stray swineherd, or
a charcoal burner.  This forest was bounded on the
north by the line of the present railings, which faces the
high road, and which therefore forms the natural
boundary of Hyde Park, beyond which it never extended.


<pb id="p.114" n="114"/>

 </p><p> During the troubled times of the Commonwealth,
the Park was sold for ready money, and the indentures
of sale, composed with puritanical preciseness and
dulness, may give us some little insight into the state
at that period of the Gardens which were to be. The
part around Kensington was meadow land, stocked
with deer. The Park itself was intersected by a chain
of eleven pools, the germ of the present Serpentine.
But Kensington Gardens, as distinct from Hyde
Park, did not exist until the time when King William
purchased the Palace from the "orator dismal of
Nottinghamshire." They then consisted of twentysix acres stretching westwards from the present broad
walk, and including Palace Green, on the west side of
which stood Henry the Eighth's conduit, said to have
been built for the use of good Queen Bess in her
childhood. In King William's time, the gardens were
adorned in summer with orange, lemon, myrtle, and
similarplants, which were put under shelter for the
winter. <persName key="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</persName> added thirty acres to the north
of the Banqueting House, as far as the Bayswater
Road. "This," says Addison, "was at first nothing
but a gravel pit" (being in fact the site of Oberon's
         <pb id="p.115" n="115"/>

capital in Tickell's poem). The unsightly hollow was
formed into a beautiful dell, and close beside an
artificial mound was raised. The traces of this latter
structure still remain.  It was, according to Miss
Strickland, the one commonly attributed to Queen
Caroline, which used to command a view of the Brentford Road, and which was fitted up with a turning
alcove, capable of being adjusted so as to suit the
direction of the wind. Whether Caroline made the
mound or not, she was the great patron of Kensington
Gardens, and added to it some three hundred acres,
taken from the Park. She also constructed the Serpentine, and made other vigorous improvements. Her
dapper little husband was under the impression that
the cost of these alterations came out of his wife's
revenue, but on her death it appeared that 20,000
of his own money had been expended! At this time
it must be remembered that the Gardens were reserved
for the use of the Royal Family, so that the curtailment of 300 acres of Hyde Park was a somewhat cool
proceeding on the part of Her Majesty. Once, indeed,
she thought of appropriating entirely St. James's
Park, and asked Sir Robert Walpole what he con











<pb id="p.116" n="116"/>

sidered would be the probable cost of the undertaking.
He replied, "Only three crowns," and the Queen
appeared to consider the price too great. But to return to the Gardens.  The Serpentine gained its
inappropriate name from the single curve which
distinguished it from the rectangular ponds in vogue
at the time it was formed. There was also some talk
about fountains and pleasure boats, but these are the
offspring of a later age. At the same time, the Round
Pond was excavated, and thence long vistas stretched
through the surrounding woods, to the head of the
Serpentine, reaching as far as Hyde Park. The eye
may even be carried beyond, for the only boundary
between the two is the ditch and low sunken wall; a
species of fence commonly called Ha-Ha, as they interpose a barrier where none is expected.
 </p><p> Crabbe, the poet, considered the effect of all this,
new and striking, and that the Gardens had a very
peculiar effect, " not exhilarating, I think, but alive
and pleasant." With all these civilizing influences,
the Gardens were in a tolerable state of nature for
years afterwards. Even as late as <date value="1798">1798</date>, a keeper
accidentally shot a man here while fox hunting. Such




            <pb id="p.117" n="117"/>

stray shots were not the only perils. Hyde Park was
infested with footpads, and so surrounded with dangers
was the high road between Kensington and the Metropolis, that pedestrians prepared for the journey as
if they were about to cross the Sahara. Would-be
voyagers were mustered by the sound of a bell, and
only started when a sufficiently strong caravan had
been assembled. About a century ago, two ladies
encountered two gentlemanly-dressed men in the
Broad Walk, and as the evening was drawing in,
gladly accepted their proffered protection through the
Park. But the cavaliers proved to be footpads, without even that gallantry with which highwaymen have
been credited, for they robbed the two trusting ladies
of their watches, money, and jewels, and walked off,
leaving their fair companions to return, sadder and
wiser to their homes.
 </p><p> We have as yet said nothing about the promenades;
these, indeed, form the chief glory of the Gardens.
They seem to have commenced in George the First's
reign, and to have arrived at their culminating point
in that of his son. The company was of the most
select description. None were admitted except on












<pb id="p.118" n="118"/>
Saturdays, and then only in full dress. Even a half
century later, when the Palace was no longer a regal
residence, no one could gain admittance if he wore a
silk neck-tie, or leathern trousers, or if he were without
top-boots.    Common     soldiers and sailors were also
rigidly excluded.    In  <date value="1814">1814</date>, servants in livery, and
dogs, were excluded, but some thirty years later the
Gardens were open all the year round from          sunrise
to sunset, to all respectably dressed persons. The
following squib was one day found on one of the seats,
the  hour for closing     the gates being then       eight
o'clock.

      <quote rend="blockquote"> "Poor Adam and Eve were from Eden turned out,
         <lb/>As a punishment due to their sin ;
       <lb/>But here after eight, if you loiter about,
         <lb/>As a punishment, you'll be locked in."</quote>

  </p><p>The   Saturday promenades were indeed glorious.
Tickell thus celebrates them in the opening verses of
the poem to which we are indebted for our title:
     <quote rend="blockquote"> " Where Kensington high o'er the neighbouring lands,
      <lb/>'Midst greens and sweets, a regal fabric stands,
      <lb/>And sees each spring luxuriant in her bowers,
      <lb/>A snow of blossoms and a wild of flowers,
      <lb/>The dames of Britain oft in crowds repair,
      <lb/>To gravel walks and unpolluted air;
                <pb id="p.119" n="119"/>

    <lb/>Here, while the Town in damps and darkness lies,
    <lb/>They breathe in sunshine and see azure skies;
    <lb/>Each walk with robes of various dies bespread,
    <lb/>Seems from afar a moving tulip bed,
    <lb/>Where rich brocades and glossy damasks glow,
    <lb/>And chints, the rival of the showery bow."</quote>
 </p><p> Head and chief among the company were the maids
of honour to the Queen. There might be seen the
beautiful Mary Lepell-she whose charms even affected
the dried-up heart of Voltaire, and who married our
old acquaintance, the gossipping Lord Hervey. There
was Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, witty and pretty,
but if report say true, no ardent admirer of the maxim
that "cleanliness is next to godliness." There was
Madge Bellenden,"the tallest of the land," and her sister
Mary, afterwards Duchess of Argyle. The beauties
would not be without cavaliers; Garth, <persName key="Swift">Swift</persName>, Addison,
Steel, and Vanbrugh,all might be seen sauntering along
the walks. Later on, their places were taken by ladies
equally as fair, and cavaliers as renowned. The beautiful Miss Gunnings (you may see several portraits of
them at the Bethnal Green Museum), Miss Chudleigh,
afterwards Duchess of Queensbury, Lord Chesterfield,
the cynic, George Selwyn, the rake, Beau Nash, and a
long string of others, good, bad, and indifferent. But












<pb id="p.120" n="120"/>

even the life of a Court beauty is not without its trials.
Pope says he and several ladies agreed that the career
of a maid of honour was of all things the most
miserable, and adds a description of the duties involved.
To eat "Westphalia ham in a morning, ride over
hedges and ditches on borrowed hacks, come home in
the heat of the day with a fever and (what is worse a
hundred times) with a red mark on the forehead from
an uneasy hat; all this may qualify them to make
excellent wives for fox-hunters, and rear up abundance
of ruddy-complexioned children. As soon as they can
recover from the heat of the day, they must simper an
hour and catch cold in the Princess's apartment; from
thence (as Shakespeare has it) to dinner with what
appetite they may, and after that till midnight, walk,
work, or think, which they please."
 </p><p> The fashions of these promenades were absurd
enough, but we are afraid we are not sufficiently
acquainted with the subject to go into the technicalities of furbelows, patches, hoops, brocades,
chintzes, drums, go-carts, sacks, negligees, mobcaps, laces and ribbons, hoods and flounces; nor
indeed dare we even attempt any description of

             <pb id="p.121" n="121"/>

periwigs, cocked hats, perukes, bobs, or bagwigs.  Of all these important matters we are
lamentably ignorant. Even so far back as the reign
of <persName key="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</persName>, a sober writer of that period laments
greatly the prodigality of the fair sex in regard to
dress, but praises the moderation of their husbands.
"The women," he adds, "who value themselves most
upon a fine outward appearance, cannot keep within
these bounds. They know that love delights in toys,
and that men love to be caught in a gaudy net.
Therefore they go still in rich silks, with all the setsoff that art can possibly invent, and herein the citizens'
wives, and maid-servants, run into such excess as
makes a confusion: so hard is it sometimes to know
a tradesman's wife from a lady; or the maid from the
mistress."  But the arch-height of absurdity was
attained by the Maccaronies. These were the fellows
of a club who had imported from abroad foreign
fashions and foreign dishes, from one of which latter
they derived their name. They wore their hair in a
high mitre-looking knob with a chignon and curls,
sported a small cocked hat with a gold tassel on each
side to keep its balance true, and had all their clothes













<pb id="p.122" n="122"/>

ornamented with bunches of ribbons, and as tight
fitting as a glove.      The Gardens seem       to have been
one of their favourite haunts. Sheridan thus describes
their promenades:
    <quote rend="blockquote">   " In Kensington-gardens to stroll up and down,
       <lb/>You know was the fashion before you left town;
       <lb/>The thing's well enough, when allowance is made
       <lb/>For the size of the trees and the depth of the shade.
       <lb/>But the spread of their leaves such a shelter affords
       <lb/>To those noisy, impertinent creatures called birds,
       <lb/>Whose ridiculous chirruping ruins the scene,
       <lb/>Brings the country before me, and gives me the spleen.
       <lb/>Yet though 'tis too rural-to come near the mark,
       <lb/>We all herd in one walk, and that nearest the Park;
       <lb/>There with ease we may see, as we pass by the wicket,
       <lb/>The chimneys of Knightsbridge, and footmen at cricket.
       <lb/>I must though in justice, declare that the grass
       <lb/>Which, worn by our feet, is diminish'd apace,
       <lb/>In a little time more will be brown, and as flat,
       <lb/>As the sand at Vauxhall or as Ranelagh mat.
       <lb/>Improving thus fast, perhaps by degrees,
       <lb/>We may see rolls and butter spread under the trees,
       <lb/>With a small pretty band in each seat of the walk,
       <lb/>To play little tunes, and enliven our talk."</quote>

  </p><p> But, reader, all that nonsense is now a century old.
 We at least have improved on our ancestors. Walk
 into Rotten-row any afternoon. Do you see dandies
 there now?      Do you see conceited young jackanapes
 in  patent leather boots, whisking canes, and making

            <pb id="p.123" n="123"/>

themselves struttingly ridiculous ? Do you see ladies
in toppling high-heeled boots or nominal bonnets?
Do you hear young subalterns drawling insipid
nothings to their fair friends? Does anybody wear
false plaits?  Does anybody affect rouge?  No! we
may indeed be thankful, no such eye-sores are to be
seen now; this is the age of sense and learning.
Such fopperies have long since entirely disappeared.
 </p><p> After all, although the history of the Gardens is
largely a record of pageants and fopperies, yet great
men have passed within their gates, and great men have
paced their avenues.  Paioli, the Corsican patriot
enjoyed a walk here with his friend Boswell, and, half
a century later, Blucher sought refuge in the Gardens
from the enthusiastic populace who wished one and all
to shake hands with the great Prussian general.
  </p><p>Chateaubriand too, delighted to stroll under these
beautiful trees, where, in the days of his exile, he used
to meet his fellow sufferers, the French priests, reciting
their breviary-those trees under which he had " indulged in many a reverie, under which he had breathed
many a sigh for his home in La Belle France, under
which he had finished ' Atala,' and had composed
Rene'"




<pb id="p.124" n="124"/>

  </p><p>It would be wearisome to recount how often gaily
dressed crowds have skated on the frozen Serpentine,
and how the fashionables have meandered from one
spot to another. The Gardens possess something more
interesting than these promenades, human beings more
attractive than languishing belles or youths redolent
of " tags, feathers, and martial foolery."  The proper
time for a visit is about three or four in the afternoon.
At that hour, on some summer's day, direct your steps
to the Round Pond, or some other portion entirely
devoted to the rising generation.  What can be more
enjoyable than to have some demure little maiden step
up to you softly, with her hands nervously clasped
behind her back, and in a voice trembling with excitement, enquire the time ? If you are wise you will not
give a careless reply, or answer her abruptly with some
vague guess, but, with an air befitting the importance
of the occasion, draw forth your watch, make due
allowance for its peculiarities, and tell her the hour to
a minute. Then with a sudden dart your little questioner will skip away to communicate the result of her
enquiries triumphantly to her playmates.  On such
afternoons the view from the round pond with the old









                <pb id="p.125" n="125"/>

Dutch Palace in the background, and the mingling
green of the trees circling round is, we think, marvellously fine.  If one but know how to appreciate the
youngsters; if a little more attention were paid to the
proper cleansing of the Pond itself; and if there were
not so many nursemaids and red-coated soldiers to
take care of the children, the Gardens would be complete. They must be wise old trees, those that circle
the pond; that is if wisdom increase with age. Had
they the voice which the Arabian improvisator, and
later on our own Poet-Laureate, have bestowed on some
of their brethren, what memories they might unfold to
us! We should be told how in various ages, they or
their ancestors have sheltered the "shorn and sleek
monk of the Abbey of Hyde," and the " man-minded
offset of Bluff Harry who rose to chase the deer at
five;" how the gallants and ladies of the merry
Monarch's time have disported themselves beneath
their branches, and how to use the poet's own words:

         <quote rend="blockquote">   " They have shadowed many a group
            <lb/>Of beauties, that were born
            <lb/>In tea-cup times of hood and hoop,
            <lb/>Or while the Patch was worn."</quote>
 </p><p> Nay, the old trees have older memories, for they




<pb id="p.126" n="126"/>
may have heard from their gandsires, when yet young
saplings, of the
             <quote rend="blockquote">  "Fairies that will flit,
               <lb/>To make the greensward fresh."
</quote>
and some rumours may even have reached them of
Albion and Kenna.
 </p><p> Yet their work is not yet over, and so long as they
afford a pleasant shelter to those who must pass their
lives in this smoky, dingy, but after all, pleasant
London, so long should Londoners join heartily in
singing their praises.</p>

</p><p>IF we leave the Gardens, and, passing by the Albert
Memorial, enter the high road near the Knightsbridge
Barracks, we shall find ourselves at the eastern extremity of Kenna's Kingdom.
 </p><p> The parish here is narrowed into a little slip, like a
triangle with the top cut off, and ladies will at once see
how appropriate is the name of gore, or goar, as used
by dressmakers, which derivation we much prefer to
one that signifies " mud and dirt," for which the road
from London to Kensington was at one time famous.
The name is as old as the troubled times of wicked
King John, during whose reign we find it mentioned
under the outlandish appellation of Kinggesgor. We




<pb id="p.128" n="128"/>

also find it alluded to as Kyng's Gore, and the Gara,
or the Gare, which Herbert, Abbot of Westminster,
gave to the nuns of Kilburn. Kensington Gore consisted of five small houses, which Leigh Hunt thought
would exactly suit a supernumerary set of maids of
honour, or five younger brothers of lords of the bedchamber, all bachelors, and expecting places in reversion. But two of these houses had histories of their
own.
  </p><p>In No. 2, lived Wilkes. <persName key="Jack Wilkes">Jack Wilkes</persName>, blackguard
and fine gentleman, scholar and demagogue, political
scribbler and libertine, idol of the city and the people,
and general representative of Liberty. It is strange,
indeed, under what forms that goddess is venerated.
Wilkes was just as much a representative of Liberty
as was the frail goddess of the French Republicans.
Yet for some time Wilkes and Liberty followed each
other as u follows q. "A wit of the time, indeed,"
says Leigh Hunt, " commenced a letter with ' Sir, I
take the Wilkes and Liberty to assure you.' "
  </p><p>Wilkes in <date value="1763">1763</date> was the editor, and, indeed, almost
entire writer of a scurrilous journal, the North Briton.
In the celebrated No. 45 of that journal, he censured







               <pb id="p.129" n="129"/>

 the King's speech on the closing of Parliament, with
 a freedom unusual, though not greater than Wilkes
 had himself exercised in former numbers of the
 obnoxious publication.
  </p><p> In truth the libel was a dull one, and is described
 by Burke, as "a spiritless, though virulent perform ance,-a mere mixture of vinegar and water, at once
 vapid and sour."
  </p><p> The then Prime Minister, Charles Grenville, of whose
heedlessness and incapacity England still witnesses
the effects, had Wilkes arrested by a general warrant,
one not specifying the names of any persons, but
directed against the authors, printers, and publishers.
Thus Wilkes became a martyr, and the No. 45 famous
How Wilkes was released on his privilege as a member of Parliament; how he recovered damages in an
action brought against the Under Secretary of State;
how he was expelled the House of Commons and
outlawed; how general warrants were declared illegal
by the Rockingham administration which succeeded
Grenville's; how Wilkes retired to France, and how
he returned in <date value="1768">1768</date>, and was elected member for
Middlesex; how the election was declared null and





<pb id="p.130" n="130"/>

void; and how he was again returned, and passed
over by the House of Commons, and of the storm
that these proceedings raised, all this is matter of
general history, and is a story that has been told and
retold.
 </p><p> When at length he was permitted in <date value="1774">1774</date> to take
his seat for Middlesex, and was in the same month
installed as Lord Mayor of London, he became nobody. Never, perhaps, in England had a greater
scoundrel, a greater share of public popularity and
admiration.  Benjamin Franklin believed that if
<persName key="George III">George III</persName>. had had a bad private character and
John Wilkes a good one, the latter might have turned
the former out of the kingdom.
 </p><p> The same statesman tells us how when visiting the
neighbourhood of Winchester, there was for a length
of sixty-four miles scarcely a window or door
shutter next the road unmarked with "Wilkes and
Liberty," and "Number 45."  Without these safeguards, indeed, the windows would probably have
been smashed, and the doors broken open.
  </p><p> The sound of Wilkes and 45 was so much disliked
 in the Court that George the Fourth, when a boy,


             <pb id="p.131" n="131"/>

 having been scolded for some naughtiness could think
 of no more deadly revenge than creeping up to the
 door of the King's room, shouting " Wilkes and
 No. 45 for ever!" and then running off again. But
 Wilkes' demagogue days were over when he took up
 his residence at Kensington Gore.
 </p><p>He was a very ugly man, tall and thin, with a
 sallow face, a squint, and an underhanging jaw. These
 graces of nature he set off by a suit of scarlet and
 buff, a rosetted cocked hat, and military boots. Ugly
 as he was, his impudence, audacity, and wit, made
 him a great favourite with the ladies. He himself
 would say that he wanted but a half-hour at starting
 to make him, the ugliest man in England, even with
 the handsomest.

 handsomest man in England.

House was the last of the row-a low, unornamented,
white-painted building, which stood not many yards
to the east of the great entrance of the Albert Hall.



<pb id="p.132" n="132"/>
We say stood, for, alas, it stands no more. It has
gone the way of all the row, that way which befalls
houses as well as human beings, though the houses
can boast of greater possible longevity. We paid a
visit to the site of the old house just after the building
itself had been pulled down to make room for the new
road that leads up to the Albert Hall.
 </p><p> We wished to take a farewell look at the gardenthat garden where Wilberforce sat and read under the
shade of the old walnut and mulberry trees, older still
now by half a century, where Louis Napoleon chatted
with the <persName key="Countess of Blessington>">Countess of Blessington</persName>, and Tom Moore
admired the last amateur effort of his artistic friend
" the glass of fashion and the mould of form," Count
D'Orsay; and where Soycr may have looked smilingly
round on gormandizing visitors appreciating his culinary triumphs. Alas! when we arrived at the scene
of these departed glories we found that all access to
it was barred by a horribly unpicturesque hoarding,
covered with still more unpicturesque advertisements.
Not feeling interested in the statement that " The
Moore and Burgess Minstrels never performed out of
London," or speculating as to whether the Daily

Telegraph was better off with " the largest circulation
in the world" than the Daily, News with a "worldwide" one, or even seduced by the thoughts of a trip
to Brighton and back for 3s., we turned round by the
Albert Hall, and looked about for some means of
getting into the gardens and treading on the site
of <placeName key="Gore House">Gore House</placeName>. As our time was short, and our
historical minds wound up to the highest pitch, and
the fence was not more than twelve feet in height, we
cast a furtive glance around, and seeing no one to
make remarks, tumbled somehow or other over the
wall, and at once started to ramble.
 </p><p> The garden was in an awful mess, strewed with
brick-bats and rubbish, very different to what it must
have been in the time of William Wilberforce, who
speaks of its thick foliage, and says he can almost
imagine himself two hundred miles away from the
great city. Its present state reminded us more of its
first tenant, some miserly Government contractor, who
was so stingy that he let the garden grow wild rather
than waste a farthing over it. But to return to
Wilberforce, who succeeded him. We like to think of
this great man with gratitude, and speak of him after

the manner of his monumental inscription in Westminster Abbey. We like to think of the delicate boy
at the age of fourteen addressing a letter to the editor
of a York paper "in condemnation of the odious
traffic in human flesh," and of the old septuagenarian.
true to his purpose during those sixty years, thanking
God on his death-bed that he had lived to witness a
day when England was willing to give twenty millions
sterling for the abolition of slavery. This seems to
have been the one purpose for which Wilberforc was
born, and it is well for him that his memory will be
handed down to posterity almost solely for his services on behalf of the slave. Other sides of his
character are not so pleasing. Ardent as he was in
the cause of bodily freedom, he would have forced his
own doxy and creed on the world without the slightest
regard for religious liberty. He imagined himself a
special favourite of God, and his diary is full of pious
self-congratulation. We find him speaking of walking
from Hyde Park Corner to <placeName key="Gore House">Gore House</placeName>, and repeating
the one hundred and seventy-six verses of the 119th
Psalm, " in great comfort." What a memory he must
have had!


             <pb id="p.135" n="135"/>

 </p><p> The next name on the roll of <placeName key="Gore House">Gore House</placeName> celebrities
is that of Margaret Power, <persName key="Countess of Blessington">Countess of Blessington</persName>.
 </p><p> Philosophers and historians have not yet decided
how much of the career of a human being is due to
his own inherent character, and how much depends
on the modifications of external circumstance. But
no one can doubt that in analyzing any one's
character much importance must be attached to daily
surroundings. If ever woman was surrounded by evil
influences, that woman was Margaret Power.
 </p><p> Her father was " Edmund Power, Esq., of Knockbrit, near Clonmel, in the county of Tipperary." He
was a type of that evil race of last century Irish
squires, a curse to their country and themselves. Of
those bad men Edmund Power seems to have been
the worst. His character was that of a savage who
has adopted all the vices which accompany civilization, with none of its benefits. In his native country
he was known as the "Buck," "Shiver the Frills,"
and " Beau Power," and is said to have been " a fine
looking man, of an imposing appearance, showy, and
of an aristocratic air, very demonstrative of frills and
ruffles, much given to white cravats, leather breeches











<pb id="p.136" n="136"/>

and top-boots." He was dissipated, reckless, and extravagant, a tyrant-at-home, a Roman Catholic, who
turned Protestant and then hunted the Romanists so
fiercely as to bring upon himself a charge of murder.
When, at the age of seventy, he died, the only preparation for that event of which he could boast was
"that he had been able to take his four or five
tumblers of punch the evening before."
 </p><p> Such was Margaret's father.
</p><p>  Before she was fifteen, this father sold his daughter
to a man as brutal as himself.
 </p><p> This man, a Captain Farmer, whom we may
charitably believe to have been half a madman, used
to strike his wife on the face, pinch her till her arms
were black and blue, lock her up whenever he went
abroad, and half starve her.
</p><p>  At length a separation took place.  In <date value="1817">1817</date>,
Farmer ended his worthless life by dropping, when
drunk, from a two-pair-of-stairs window, leaving his
widow, of whom, for about the space of nine years
little is known, a free woman.
 </p><p> Her second husband was the Earl of <placeName key="Blessington">Blessington</placeName>,
who, it has been said, was as foolishly mad as her
first was mad mischievously.








                <pb id="p.137" n="137"/>

 </p><p> After the marriage, the couple lived in a " style of
princely splendour" in St. James' Square. Here the
social status of the Earl, the fascinations of his wife,
and the excellence of the cook, drew to the house a
number of men of note-politicians, authors, artists,
and aristocrats. Lord <placeName key="Blessington">Blessington</placeName> was more economical after marriage than he had been before, at least,
so thinks Dr. Madden, her ladyship's biographer-he
only spent all his annual income and six thousand a
year besides! The Countess was profusely luxurious,
her husband profusely lavish.
 </p><p> Among his favourites was Count Alfred D'Orsay,
the son of a French general, one of the old nobility of
France. The Earl's favour knew no bounds; he
married the Count to his daughter, by a former wife,
and with his daughter went one hundred thousand
pounds to the Count's creditors. It was a similar
case to Lady <placeName key="Blessington">Blessington</placeName>'s first marriage, only there
the lady was sold, here the gentleman was purchased.
The poor pale, girlish-looking Lady Harriet was
fetched from the schoolroom, to marry a spendthrift,
whom, a few weeks before, she had never seen, and
whom, when she did see, she did not like. The
marriage was not a happy one.











<pb id="p.138" n="138"/>

 </p><p> In <date value="1829">1829</date> a fit of apoplexy carried off the Earl; his
widow with her stepdaughter and the Count returned
to England. She took up her residence first at
Seymour Place, and afterwards (<date value="1836">1836</date>) at <placeName key="Gore House">Gore House</placeName>.
Thither came <persName key="Count D'Orsay">Count D'Orsay</persName> separated from his wife.
With the exception of a short stay in No. 5, the
Count seems to have resided at or near <placeName key="Gore House">Gore House</placeName>
until the break up of the establishment took place in
<date value="1849">1849</date>. Here they gave the most recherche   of parties,
and became acknowledged leaders in the world of
fashion and the world of literature. To <placeName key="Gore House">Gore House</placeName>
came the wit and talent of the town. Here Moore,
the poet, would enrapture the guests with one of
his touching songs.  Here, too, the night before
Louis Napoleon made his rash expedition to
Boulogne, he appeared   at a dinner there, his
black  satin handkerchief "fastened  by a large
spread eagle in diamonds, clutching a thunderbolt of rubies," and invited the guests to dine with
him at the Tuilleries on that day twelve months.
That expedition ended in the prison of Ham, and on
his escape thence six years later, Louis Napoleon
again seized the first opportunity of entertaining a





                 <pb id="p.139" n="139"/>

brilliant company at <placeName key="Gore House">Gore House</placeName>, with an account
of his adventures. Rogers and Campbell were there,
as well as Moore, Henry Lytton Bulwer, Walter
Savage Landor, Albert Smith, Charles Dickens, and
Thackeray, with a host of less known names. Ladies
were scarcer, but " sometimes a wandering star, such
as the beautiful Guiccioli, would (says one of the Countess's visitors) add to the interest of a scene remarkable for its decorative and artistic taste."  Both Count
and Countess were general favourites. He a magnificent dandy, an amateur sculptor and painter. She
an authoress, a woman possessing great powers of
fascination, hilarious good humour, generosity and
kindness. But the whole establishment was conducted on a reckless want of principle, which almost
amounted to dishonesty. An income of &#x00A3;2,000 a
year could not possibly support an expenditure of
over &#x00A3;4,000. In the spring of <date value="1849">1849</date> came the crash.
Bill-discounters, money-lenders, jewellers, lace-v1ndors,
tax-collectors, and gas company agents became urgent
in their claims. For some time the house had been
closed like a fortress against possible sheriffs officers
and <persName key="Count D'Orsay">Count D'Orsay</persName> had not dared to venture out, ex










<pb id="p.140" n="140"/>

-cept on Sundays, or in the dusk of the evening. At
length the fortress was entered by stratagem.
  </p><p>"Bah," said the Count incredulously, when told
that a sheriffs officer was in the house. On the next
morning, he left with his valet and one portmanteau
for Paris. Thither the Countess followed him. In
their prosperity Louis Napoleon, then an exile, now
President of the French Republic, had been their
frequent guest; he seems now to have done little for
his old friends. Lady <placeName key="Blessington">Blessington</placeName> began to furnish
splendidly in Paris, but in June she died, and before
long D'Orsay followed her to the grave. A sad and
painful story, too sad and painful for us to wish to
linger over it.
 </p><p> One more tenant of <placeName key="Gore House">Gore House</placeName>, and we have done.
We are happy to say that it is a man who will put
us into a good humour again. The world owes far
more to <persName key="Alexis Soyer">Alexis Soyer</persName> than to <persName key="Count D'Orsay">Count D'Orsay</persName>. In
<date value="1851">1851</date> Soyer opened <placeName key="Gore House">Gore House</placeName> as a restaurant for
all nations," during the great Exhibition. Soyer
might be considered as the leader of domestic
economy for the people. If he could only have lived
to have seen the school of cookery at South Ken










<pb id="p.141" n="141"/>

sington! Soyer, perfect master as he was of the
gastronomic art, did not consider cookery for the
people beneath his notice, and many parts of his
little work on this subject are as interesting as any
novel. There is a mixture of Athens and fryingpans, Pythagoras and Irish stew, Napoleon and cocka-leckie, in his receipts which is really quite charming.
He seems to have cared for the palates of the poor as
well as those of the rich, and while his dinners at
three guineas a head are said to have been almost
perfect, he took much interest in the starving Irish, and
declared they would never emerge from semi-barbarianism until they had learned to cook properly.
We remember hearing of a French chef-de-cuisine
who, in a rough estimate respecting a supper which
he presented to his master, had put down fifty hams,
only one of which was to appear on the table, the
other forty-nine being required for sauces and
garnishes. When the master remonstrated, the cook
offered if the hams perturbed him to melt them down
into a little glass bottle no bigger than his thumb.
Soyer, on the other hand, tells us how, by judicious
cookery, more than one hundred thousand tons of



















<pb id="p.142" n="142"/>

ham might be saved annually. Soyer was certainly
the prince of cooks!
 </p><p> Afterwards <placeName key="Gore House">Gore House</placeName> was turned into a Cabinet
Exhibition, and has now shared the fate of all old
houses, and vanished off the face of the earth. We
are glad to hear that the trees are, as far as possible,
to remain undisturbed ; and we would ask our readers
the next time they visit the Albert Hall, just to give a
glance towards the spot where the old house stood.
The memories it suggests if somewhat sad will
probably do us good; and, at all events, we hope
may help to pass an otherwise idle ten minutes.</p>

</p><p>WE had not long left <placeName key="Gore House">Gore House</placeName> and were walking
along quickly, with a mind full of the sad story of
Margaret Gardiner, of the frivolities of <persName key="Count D'Orsay">Count D'Orsay</persName>,
the narrow-mindedness of Wilberforce, and the culinary
talent of Soyer, when the heavy thud of the mason's
hammer, and the chip, chip of the cold chisel fell on
our ears, and, looking up, we beheld the evil fairybricks-and-mortar-hard at work again.   Having
knocked down poor old Kensington and Colby
Houses, she was now engaged in rearing on their
site a structure, so stupendous and palatial, as almost
to make us forget that she was an evil fairy at all.












<pb id="p.144" n="144"/>

Yes; the two old houses were gone; scarce anything
remained of them but a part of the wall; and we feel
it but right to pause in our wanderings and sing a
pean over their departed glories, before the great,
new mansion should have completely crushed all
vestiges of its predecessors under its heel. There
was a great deal of historic moss that used to cluster
over the two old dwellings; and it is pleasant to
remember that historic moss will continue green, long
after the buildings which have given birth to it have
rotted away. The shadows of the beautiful Duchess
who lived at <placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName> in the reign of George
the First, of her neighbour-the old miser-at Colby
House, of the worthy pedagogue, friend of the great
lexicographer, of the unfortunate heir to the crown of
France, and of the talented novelist and authoress,
will flit about the old spot for many a year to come,
until the new house has grown old and has historical
memories of its own.
 </p><p> The beautiful Duchess was Louise de Querouaille,
mistress of Charles the Second, around whom, notwithstanding her baby face and luxurious beauty,
hang many dark state secrets. Louis the Fourteenth





               <pb id="p.145" n="145"/>

and our merry monarch had entered into a bargain.
Charles sold himself, his religion, and his country to
Louis; and Louis agreed to pay Charles an annual
salary. England was to become Roman Catholic
and aid the French king in subduing the Protestant
Dutch; and the Grand Monarque was to pay the
money regularly, and send over French soldiers in
case any Englishmen were stupid enough to object
to the arrangement. Louis evidently thought he had
the best of the bargain, and he actually threw in a
French mistress, gratis, so that Charles might not
repent, and think the terms too hard. This French
beauty was Louise de Querouaille. She did not live
in <placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName> then. It does not, in fact, appear to have been built till the time of William the
Third. But when Charles was dead, and his brother
had been driven from the English throne for attempting to carry out similar propositions to those contained in the French compact, Madame Louise, now
Duchess of Portsmouth, paid occasional visits to this
country, and, in the reign of George the First, actually
put in a claim for a pension from the English Government. The old miser, Sir Thomas Colby, may have












<pb id="p.146" n="146"/>

been her neighbour, for Colby House was built in
<date value="1720">1720</date>. How Sir Thomas must have glared at the
pretty baby-face looking out of the neighbouring
window, as he thought of any of his much coveted
money, which he had been obliged to part with in
the shape of taxes, being bestowed on her. Colby
died in a very characteristic manner. In the middle
of one night the baronet recollected that he had left
the keys of the wine cellar on the table. Visions of
his servants running off with a bottle of his port wine
rose before his eyes, and he was not satisfied until he
had gone down stairs and returned with the key in
safety. But he was unwell at the time and the exposure to the night air caused his death. He died
without a will, and his large fortune, over two hundred
thousand pounds, was shared among his nearest relations, who were day labourers. But to return to
<placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName>. In Dr. Johnson's time it was
inhabited by his friend, the worthy old schoolmaster,
James Elphinstone. Johnson seems to have been
there pretty often himself, and some of his fierce
bearish retorts, recorded by Boswell, were uttered
there. Elphinstone was successful in his school, but





             <pb id="p.147" n="147"/>

his attempts to appear in print were not so prosperous.
He published a translation of some Latin epigrams,
which Garrick said was more difficult to understand
than the original. One of his hobbies was the reformation of spelling on the phonetic principle, but
mankind could not be brought to spell cat with a k;
and his works on this subject, though decidedly better
than the epigrams, have long ago been forgotten.
 </p><p> Mr. Elphinstone is almost forgotten too, and the
French Jesuits' School which succeeded his academy
has more interesting memories for us. Very different
were the Jesuitical schoolmasters from the worthy
translator of epigrams. The orator Shiel describes
the head of the establishment as a little slender, and
gracefully constructed Abbe, with irreproachably
fitting clothes, silk waistcoat, black stockings, small
shoes buckled with silver, and a smile made up of
guile and weakness. As might have been guessed
from his whole manner, and, above all, perhaps, from
his sloping forehead, he was one of the old French
noblesse-Monsieur le Prince de Broglie. Most of
the pupils were sons of the unfortunate French refugees
who had fled from their country during the horrors of











<pb id="p.148" n="148"/>

the Reign of Terror; some were the children of
French West Indian planters. Both these Creoles
and their companions, differ as they might on other
subjects, agreed at least on one point, hatred towards
England. Nothing could exceed the patriotic rapture
of the sons of the French nobles when they heard of
some fresh victory obtained by France, the country
that had beheaded their fathers, or driven them into
exile, over England, the country that had given them
shelter. Charles the Tenth, or " Monsieur," as he was
then called, visited <placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName>, and the Duke
de Grammont and many other noblemen were among
its pupils. But we must linger no longer with the
French emigrant school, nor can we do more than
mention Mrs. Inchbald, authoress, actress, and a
really good woman, who lived there when the house
had been turned into a Catholic boarding establishment, where the Archbishop of Jerusalem performed
mass. Mrs. Inchbald lived at other houses in the
neighbourhood, and was buried in the churchyard.
in speaking of which we shall have to mention her
again.
</p><p>  We can scarcely regret the downfall of Kensington




                 <pb id="p.149" n="149"/>

and Colby Houses, for with them the" Rookeries," that
unfathomable abode of misery and vice, has gone
too. It was traditionally said to have been tenanted
by the remains of the population of Saint Giles's,
expelled from their old haunts by the march of civilization. And now they have once more been driven
out, like the wild Indians of North America; perhaps,
like them, to meet at last with extermination amid
the march of improvement. Farewell then, Kensington and Colby Houses! How often have we
passed them unheeded, and now that they have gone
for ever, we look back on them regretfully, as on old
friends whom we have scarcely appreciated sufficiently
when they were by our side. All we can do now is
to cherish the old associations that clung about them,
and keep them, a little longer, from falling into blank
forgetfulness.

  </p><p>The present high-pressure existence is not very
favourable to the proper enjoyment of such recollections, and who is there that, leading a busy, bustling,
every day life, does not often long for a pause, a break




<pb id="p.150" n="150"/>
during which he should have nothing to do but to
furbish up old memories, to think of what has been
done, and what yet remains to be done, when the
myriads of innumerable trifles, which have been put
off " until I have time," may be accomplished.
 </p><p> We fancy that the origin of Squares may be
traced to this feeling. Just turn out of the busy
high road of Kensington, and take a glance at
either of the two which lie on the south side of the
high road: <placeName key="Kensington Square">Kensington Square</placeName> and <placeName key="Edwardes Square">Edwardes Square</placeName>.
How silent they seem. How forgetful of the outside
world. How wrapt up in themselves. The houses in
<placeName key="Kensington Square">Kensington Square</placeName> are just the sort of places for
girls' schools-for young ladies, it seems, are like
hyacinths, and must remain during the earlier portion
of their lives in the dark, in order that they may be
the more dazzling and brilliant when once that preliminary period of probation is outlived. Just the
sort of houses where dwell crammers, mysterious
beings, who soak Latin, Greek, and mathematics into
the heads of aspirants for civil and military honours ;
dread men these, who laugh in their sleeves at examiners and commissioners, and who turn out suc




               <pb id="p.151" n="151"/>

cessful candidates as biscuits are turned out at Huntly
and Palmer's manufactory. The old Square looks
stolidly on all the changes which it has undergone;
and they are many. A very old Square; report says
it was commenced in the reign of James the Second;
and Covent Garden market, said to be the oldest of
London squares, was only built a half century earlier.
Of course it has been repaired, and partially rebuilt
since then, but some of the houses are still very old.
 </p><p> Let us then drift back a couple of centuries and we
shall find that the Square, though in an unfinished
state, is crowded with fashionable company. The
ladies are in rich dresses, and looped-up skirts, sleeves
tight to the elbow, and large turned-back cuffs, long
gloves, and lace ruffles; the hair towering above to a
height of a foot or more, ornamented with ribbons and
lace. The gentlemen in long waistcoats and tights,
big wigs, hats with turned up brims, rosetted or
buckled shoes.
 </p><p>  Foremost among the fair sex stands the " famous
 beauty and errant lady" Hortensia Mancini, niece of
 the celebrated cardinal, with her babyish, voluptuous
 face.  When Charles the Second was an exile on the





<pb id="p.152" n="152"/>

continent, he had offered her his hand in marriage.
But the fortunes of the Stuarts were at a low ebb, the
power of Mazarin was great, and the Cardinal had
modestly declined the offer. Hortensia married, became very rich, and very unhappy, deserted her husband, or was abandoned by him; came to England
penniless, and is now living as the mistress of the
man who had once offered her his hand. Charles presented her with a pension of four thousand a year,
which-she accepted.
</p><p>  Among the gentlemen are St. Evremond, satirical,
lively, and amusing; Sidney Godolphin, who was
"never in the way, and yet never out of the way."
He and Hortensia would get on well together, for
they had at least one taste in common-that of cardplaying. But those who sought the favour of the
Duchess of Mazarin, had to endure her frowns as
well as enjoy her smiles. Her temper was naturally
uncertain, and she probably rendered it worse by
too great devotion to the great whiskey-god usquebaugh. She did not die in Kensington, but in a small
house in Paradise Row, Chelsea. A few years later
and we meet Sir Richard Blackmore, physician and





            <pb id="p.153" n="153"/>

poet. We scarcely ever hear the name now-a-days,
yet Johnson, in his" Lives of the Poets," allots a larger
space to the biography of Blackmore, than to that of
Gray! Certainly if poetry were to be measured by
quantity, Sir Richard has a decided advantage over
the author of the " Elegy in a Country Churchyard
-heroic poems in ten and twelve books, philosophical
ones in six or seven, poems on sacred subjects, on the
"Redemption," the "Creation," and the "Nature of
Man," and such odd trifles as " Poetical Advice to a
Weaver of Tapestry !" Not content with poetry, he
tried prose-religious essays, a philosophical literary
magazine, works on small pox, gout, rheumatism, the
king's evil-in short, on every ill that man endures;
works on contemporary history, on natural theology,
on the Book of Job, a Satire on Wit, a new version of
the Psalms, and an essay on Divine eloquence! Where
are all these works now? Were they, it maybe asked
so very poor? Poor, undoubtedly, but not worse than
volume after volume of prose and rhyme, which issues
daily from the London presses. The wits of that age
were very severe upon Sir Richard, and yet the greatest
aspersions that they could cast upon his moral cha










<pb id="p.154" n="154"/>

racter were that he had once been a schoolmaster, and
that he lived in the city. Pity, perhaps, that so good
a man should have spent a life in covering paper with
what none would read. His heroic poem on Prince
Arthur, does not seem to us quite so black as it has
been painted, and says something for his taste that
he should have chosen the same subject which had so
great an attraction for Milton, and which has been
made the groundwork of Tennyson's "Idylls of the
King."
 </p><p> In the medical profession Blackmore obtained considerable reputation, and it was probably his appointment as Court-physician to William the Third, that
made him choose <placeName key="Kensington Square">Kensington Square</placeName> for a residence.
Bishop Hough lived in the Square for several years,
and it is an honour to Kensington to have such a

         <pb id="p.155" n="155"/>

election to be illegal, and a royal letter shortly afterwards arrived recommending Parker, Bishop of Oxford,.
a concealed Papist, and an avowed favourer of the
Court measures, to the vacant place. Magdalene
College rose in arms, all Oxford blazed with indignation. The royal mandate was disobeyed.  At last
Special Ecclesiastical Commissioners were sent to
Oxford. Hough was ejected, Parker was installed in
his place. The Fellows of the College proved refractory; they were dismissed, and probably no single act
of James's reign, with the exception of the Trial of
the Seven Bishops, was more damaging to his cause.
When the Prince of Orange passed through Oxford in
the following year, the magistrates of the town came
in state to welcome him, and the College offered to
coin their plate for his service. The revolution was
accomplished. Dr. Hough became Bishop of Oxford,
and lived in ease and affluence until the advanced age
of ninety-three.
  </p><p> Besides Dr. Hough, <placeName key="Kensington Square">Kensington Square</placeName> can boast
of two other Bishops: Mawson, Bishop of Ely, who
occupied the house at the south west corner, and who
died there in <date value="1770">1770</date>, and Herring, Bishop of Bangor





<pb id="p.156" n="156"/>

afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury. The latter resided in the south east corner, in a house which was
afterwards occupied by the celebrated Tallyerand,
churchman and diplomatist, and who, we are told,
paid his bills regularly, a practice for which he cannot be too highly honoured.
</p><p>  The summit of prosperity was attained by the
Square long before the time of the French statesman.
Faulkner tells us that in the reign of George the
Second, the demand for lodgings there was so great
that an ambassador, a bishop, and a physician have
been known to occupy apartments in the same hous e
and that upwards of forty carriages were kept in and
about the neighbourhood.
 </p><p> Most of our fellow ramblers will remember that it
was in <placeName key="Kensington Square">Kensington Square</placeName> that Thackeray's " Esmond
had the honour of entertaining the old Pretender.
They will call to mind the dinner party, and the
guests: Captain and Mrs. Steele, who drove to Kensington "from their country house at Hampton Wick,"
Lieutenant-General Webb, Esmond's kind patron and
commander; St. John, the great Tory miuister; the
Duke of Hamilton, who so nearly made Beatrice a




         <pb id="p.157" n="157"/>

Duchess; and the Duchess of Ormond; and last,
Esmond's kind, good mistress, and that bewitching and
heartless coquette Beatrice  Esmond himself had a
lodging at Kensington, near the Square.
  </p><p>Shall we recall the fearful treason that was hatched
there, and how the plot was defeated by the very man
whom it was intended to make a king; how Esmond
spent one night at the Greyhound tavern in an agony
of love-sick fear; how the great Jacobite meeting was
held at the King's Arms; out of the window of which
<placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName> Green and the barracks could plainly
be seen, and how from that window the baulked conspirators saw the staunch Whig soldiers of Argyll's
old regiment take the place of Ormond's Tory-led
Guards, and how, in consequence of this and other
matters, the plot failed, and <persName key="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</persName> came to the
throne-most of which is unhistoric and untrue, but is,
nevertheless, as familiar to us as the historical and
truthful account of good <persName key="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</persName>'s accession.
 </p><p> The old Square has a musty appearance now, and
 there is but little to remind one of its departed glories.
 So we wave it an unregretful adieu, and once more
 entering High Street, pass on until we arrive at Earl's












<pb id="p.158" n="158"/>
Terrace, at the back of which stands what is called in
Knight's "London" a delicious square, known as
Edwardes, the family name of Lord Kensington. Its
great peculiarity is that the central enclosure is more
spacious and better cultivated than the size of the
houses would seem to warrant. Garden ground near
London costs money, and landlords are not usually
anxious to leave much of their property in advantageous situations uncovered with interest-paying brick
and mortar. Tradition says that <placeName key="Edwardes Square">Edwardes Square</placeName>
was the work of a Frenchman, that he existed
about the  commencement of the     present century, and that he built the square with a view to
the time when the British Isles would form  part
of La Grande Empire which Napoleon was forming, and when French tastes and French incomes
would rule the market. Leigh Hunt, in his old Court
Suburb, tells us that Coleridge once had lodgings in
the square, and this seems very probable. If so, it is
the only great name of which the square can boast,
for the houses are not big enough to hold ambassadors, politicians, or prelates.</p>

</p><p>NEARLY opposite the turning leading from  <placeName key="Kensington Square">Kensington Square</placeName>, but on the opposite side of the High
Street, stands the Parish church, a handsome Gothic
edifice erected by the late Sir Gilbert Scott, but in
spite of its architectural beauty, and its bravery of
stained glass windows, with Kensington Church
modern we have nothing to do. The old Parish
Church is the object of our investigations, so this must
be a mental ramble, though the old building is far
more familiar to our eyes than the new. The handsome edifice that stands there now suggests but faint
recollections of the square country-like Church that so
recently occupied its place. Our ramble, this morn

ing, then, must be among books and memory, rather
than among places and things.
</p><p>  Even in the times of Doomsday Book there were
three virgates of land set aside for a priest. The next
fact of importance solves the question-Why was the
church called St. Mary Abbot's?  It obtained the
name thus: Geoffry, the eldest son of the first lord of
Kensington, Aubrey de Vere, had been cured of an
illness by the Abbot of Abingdon, and, on his deathbed he persuaded his father to bestow the church of
Kensington on that monastery. Whether the dying
Geoffry made this request out of gratitude for his
cure, or, what is perhaps just as probable, as a sort of
counter-balance for his sins, history sayeth not, but at
all events, in the reign of Henry the First, St. Mary's
became the property of the Abbot of Abingdon, and
had the affix Abbot's added to its name to denote the
change of ownership.
 </p><p> The De Veres, like most of the Norman aristocracy,
were bountiful in their gifts to priests and monks, and
among other endowments was one at Colne, in
Essex.
</p><p>  In the beginning of the fourteenth century, the




             <pb id="p.161" n="161"/>

Prior of Colne and the Abbot of Abingdon quarrelled
about the right to the monastery at Kensington. The
dispute was settled in favour of the Abbot. The tithes
and expenses were to be divided between the latter
and the Vicar. The Bishop of London was to collate
to the Vicarage, a privilege which is still in force.
 </p><p> We may pass over some two centuries before anything interesting turns up again, but no doubt in that
time the church was pulled down and rebuilt, or at all
events repaired more than once. In the time of bluff
king Hal, we find a notice of proceedings against one
<persName key="Sebastian Harris">Sebastian Harris</persName>, who had got hold of an English
translation of the New Testament, and another book,
equally bad in the eyes of the Church, called " Unis
Dissidentium," which was found to contain the Lutheran heresy. For this heinous offence he was cited to
appear before the Vicar General (a recently appointed
officer of the Romish Church, one of whose duties
was to hunt up the followers of Luther) at St. Paul's,
there to make oath, says the old record, that he would
not retain these books nor sell them, nor lend them,
and, on pain of excommunication, not to stay in
London longer than a day and a night, nor to be



<pb id="p.162" n="162"/>

suffered to come within four miles of the town for
two years to come. All honour then to Sebastian
Harris, surely his name should be handed down in
the annals of the parish, side by side with that of the
starry Veres; yes, even that of royalty itself. What
the motive was that urged him to read the Scriptures
in his own language, and to judge for himself the
bold sayings of the German monk, we know not.
But we, as a local inhabitant, would fain think of him
as one of those who had begun to look around for
themselves, to question whether priests knew so much
more of God than other men; the leaders of that
great movement known as the Reformation. A few
years later Harris might have read his Testament in
peace, for in an inventory of the Church goods, taken
in the Protestant times of the young English Josiah,
Edward the Sixth, we find one "Byble," probably
Miles Coverdale's translation, mentioned among the
" bowks." Beyond the Bible, the Church library was
somewhat small. There was one "bowke of voyce"
(the Hymns Ancient and Modern of those days), a
" Saphlter Bowke," and the "Paraphrases of Erassymus."

           <pb id="p.163" n="163"/>

</p><p>  In the same list figures a goodly array of vestments,
and some copper and silver vessels. Most of these
would be sold or destroyed at the time of the
Reformation. Queen Mary did something to atone
for the spoliation of the Church's property during her
father's reign, and Queen Elizabeth leased the Church
to a Court favourite in <date value="1562">1562</date>.
 </p><p> We hinted above that the Church had probably
very much changed since the time when Aubrey de
Vere handed it over to the Abbot. It has, in fact,
obtained quite a celebrity for frequent patchings and
renovations. Leigh Hunt says its continual alterations beat the silk stocking, the repeated mendings
of which turned it into worsted, and adds that
they were alway worsted, badly darned. Historically
speaking,these mendings commenced about <date value="1683">1683</date>, when
a new aisle was added on the south side; and the old
Church had very little rest indeed till it was finally
pulled down a few years ago. In the reign of William
of Orange the whole building was levelled to the
ground, except the "stone tower at the west end,"
and among the names of those who subscribed towards its re-erection are King William and the

Princess Anne, the former of whom gave three
hundred pounds and the latter fifty, while the Bishop
of London is also put down for the latter amount. This
must have been Compton, who had been Anne's
tutor, and who escorted her to Northampton, armed
and wearing jack-boots, in the troubled times of <date value="1688">1688</date>.
During the two following centuries the patching,
darning, pulling to pieces and setting up again went
on, and no end of money was spent on the fabric.
 </p><p> We suppose the old Church was very ugly; we
have always found it called so in books, but one had
got to reverence its old square walls, to forget that the
font had no pretensions to antiquity, that the pews
were unsightly and not over comfortable, and we look
back even now with pleasure at the old rambling
square pew, at the black tablets over the altar, at the
funny-looking cherubim that occupied the pointed top
of the painted window and which we somehow got
into our infant head looked rather an incongruity,
and at the odd pieces of holly and ivy that served for
decoration at Christmas. The old church was full of
childish memories; of the time when the clergyman
read out that Susan Evans was to be married to some
          <pb id="p.165" n="165"/>

body else, and we felt such an intense desire to know
who Susan Evans might be, that we turned round
inquiringly to the occupants of the square pew and
innocently asked-" Susan Evans, who's she "? and
how we were instantly marched out, to remain in the
porch till service was over.
 </p><p> There was one huge door-shaped tablet on the left
hand side of the altar that always possessed great
interest for us, and we used to imagine it the entrance
to some mysterious demesne that existed somewhere
in the region of the wall. On one occasion we troubled
the occupants of the square pew by coughing, until at
length a compassionate lady made us a present of two
of Wotherspoon's lozenges in a little paper packet, an
offering which aroused our juvenile dignity, and which
we ungraciously retained in our pocket until after the
service, when we solemnly presented them to two
friends.
 </p><p> These and other recollections crowd on us.
 </p><p> We cannot help thinking, too, somewhat regretfully, of the old churchyard, and while we quite
appreciate the handsome new church with all its
improvements, wish that it had been possible to have

Countess, the remembrance of this disparity of rank
blighted the match. But the story is at all events
doubtful, though Addison evidently took much interest
in the young earl, and encouraged a taste for natural
beauties in him. In a playful letter written to his
young friend, who was then about thirteen, and which
reminds one of some of the papers in the Spectator, he
invites him to a concert " which begins at six in the
evening, and consists of a blackbird, a thrush, a robin
red-breast, and a bull-finch, with a lark that sings by
way of overture; conclusion by a nightingale with
something of Italian manners in her diversions." With
such a monitor, friend, or tutor as it may be, the young
Earl of Warwick should have grown up a promising
scion of an old race.  Tradition, however, says otherwise. This was the young nobleman to whom Addison, on his death bed, addressed the memorable words,
" See in what peace a Christian can die." It has been
considered that the Earl must have been pretty bad
to have needed such an admonition. If the incident
actually took place we think the somewhat egotistical
tone of the sentence does not at all redound to the
poet's credit, but much depends upon the manner in




             <pb id="p.169" n="169"/>

which the words were spoken, and remembering that
the dead cannot answer, let us hope that the Earl may
have stood by the bedside of his dying step-father
and friend, without any necessity of remorse for past
misconduct. Still resting our hand on the Earl of
Warwick's shoulder, and peering about with our eyes
among the stone bibles, heads, and half-defaced inscription, the following epitaph attracts our notice: </p><p> " George Colman, Patentee of the Theatre Royal,
Haymarket:   Author of the Jealous Wife, and of
various other works of literary eminence. Died 14th
August, <date value="1794">1794</date>."
</p><p>  This was George Colman the elder, his father,
Francis Colman, and his son George Colman the
younger, were also buried here. All of them wrote
for the stage. We are afraid we shall miss a great
many interesting monuments, as the tablets are piled
up here like flag stones waiting for use. Working
our way out of the shed, past the bust of Renell, vicar
of the parish, past the big bell on which we distinguish the word "Hallelujah," past machinery, and
what looks like rubbish of all kinds, we catch sight of
a weatherworn blue and red tablet just outside, to the







<pb id="p.170" n="170"/>

memory of " Reginald Spofforth, glee composer." We
did not see the name of Dr. Warren, but he was
buried here, and we must mention him, if only to tell
our readers of a pleasant answer he made to the
question, "If doctors must not be continually miserable
thinking of the number of their dead patients whom
a different treatment might perhaps have saved?"
"The balance between satisfaction and remorse, must,"
returned the doctor, "be greatly in favour of satisfaction, and, as an instance of it, I hope to have the
pleasure of curing you forty times before I kill you."
Dr. Warren had the finest eyes in the world, at least,
so says Mrs. Inchbald, who was secretly in love with
him. She herself lies here, not far from him she
loved, in the western corner of the churchyard. We
have come across her in one of our rambles already,
and may do so again, for Kensington was her favourite
dwelling place. <placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName>, Little Hol!and
House, Earl's Court Terrace, and Leonard's Placethe authoress of the simple story has resided in them
all. One can scarcely speak too highly of Mrs. Inchbald. The only fault of which she has ever been
accused was her profession, and the life of an




        <pb id="p.171" n="171"/>

actress may, perhaps, have somewhat marred the
character it could not spoil. Thrown on the world at
the age of sixteen, owing to the loss of her father, she
seems, notwithstanding her many trials and the fame
which she reached at last, to have continued selfsacrificing to her death at the age of sixty-seven;
always wishing to please others, and always cheerful.
It is sad to say, after speaking of such a woman, that
she brought on her own death by tight lacing. We
may say more about her the next time she crosses our
path, as, in so solemn a place we should wish to speak
rather of people's virtues than their foibles, or their
vices. Mrs. Inchbald has made us think of Kensington
House, and of our old friend James Elphinstone, who
had a marble tablet inscribed to his memory here. He
was buried quite close to Dr. Jortin, scholar, theological
writer, and wit, who "ceased to be mortal," as his inscription quaintly expresses it, at the age of seventyone.  Faulkner gives one anecdote of him in his
" History of Kensington," which is repeated by Leigh
Hunt, and poor as it is, we suppose we must follow
suite. When Jortin returned into the ante-chamber
after the interview with the bishop who gave him his



<pb id="p.172" n="172"/>
vicarage, he could not find his hat, and summed up
the events of the day on his return home by saying,
" I have lost my hat, but got a living." Leigh Hunt,
whom we mentioned above, used to say the churchyard was too near the bustling streets. If he thought
so twenty years ago, what would he have said now ?
He lies in Kensal-green Cemetery safe from the
turmoil of the great city.
 </p><p> We missed many of the old inscriptions, and
sincerely hope there is no truth in the report that
" many old brasses and monuments were either destroyed or sold as 'rubbish."' How such utter want
of feeling, of taste, of reverence could be shown, we
cannot imagine.  The church possessed the usual
amount of quaint epitaphs, among which the usual
examples of those inscriptions which strive to keep up
some didatic personality even beyond the grave were
to be found. In an oval over the churchwardens'
pew, Mr. Lionel Ducket somewhat startlingly reminded us that:
<quote rend="blockquote">
           My play is over, and I'm gone,
           <lb/>Reader! your part will soon come on.</quote>

</p><p>  Mr. Thomas Wright bade this vain world farewell,



              <pb id="p.173" n="173"/>

and informed us that he has had enough of it, nor
values what it may say of him. " What faults you've
seen in me," he concludes,' take care to shun; go
home, and see there's something to be done." And
certainly one fault Mr. Wright seems to have possessed, an insufferable amount of conceit.  The
following on a flat stone in the Churchyard to a
young lady of seventeen, must, we should think, have
proceeded from the pen of her lover:    <quote rend="blockquote">    Sleep soft in dust until the Almighty's will,
        <lb/>Then rise unchanged, and be an angel still.
</quote>
 </p><p> After all, is there not much of worldly parade and
conceit in thus puffing off the virtues of deceased
relatives to every casual passer by? Surely the
remembrance of our lost ones, except the world
claim them among its great, are best enshrined in
our own bosoms.
 </p><p>  The alterations consequent on the rebuilding of the
Church, have certainly taken away all the charm of
country seclusion from Kensington Churchyard. The
level of the ground has been raised by some feet, and
those tombstones which have not been raised too are
almost hidden within four walls of earth. We suppose



<pb id="p.174" n="174"/>

such things are unavoidable, and that in this busy,
improving, building age, even God's acres cannot
remain undisturbed. Such a train of thoughts makes
us wonder whether after all cremation is so uncomfortable an idea. Surely we would rather have the
remains of those we loved near to us, and in such a
form that they would be but memorials, than think of
them tossing about, where all traces of their identity
must soon be lost. From a sanitary point of view,
the question is, perhaps, still more important, and as
the dead must always give way to the living it may
not, perhaps, be long before tombstones are a thing of
the past, and will be hunted up by antiquarians with
as much zest as Roman urns are at present.</p>

</p><p>IF any of us had found ourselves in the neighbourhood of Clerkenwell, some few years back, we might
have cudgeled our brains with the statements on the
milestones that we were two miles, or four miles, or
three miles,from the spot where Hick's Hall formerly
stood. Here was an enigma rivalling in difficulty the
" Who's Griffiths?" or the " Ozokerit" of a later age.
Charles Knight, in his "London," thus paints the
perplexity of a worthy country schoolmaster, on his
first visit to the Metropolis.  "Who was Hicks?
How did Hicks obtain such a fame, that even the
milestones were inscribed to his memory? What was
his Christian name? Was he General Hicks, or



<pb id="p.176" n="176"/>

Admiral Hicks, or Bishop Hicks, or Chief Justice
Hicks? Or was he plain Mr. Hicks? And if so, was
he M.P., or F.R.S., or F.S.A., or M.R.I.A., and why
did he build a hall?" The simple solution to all this
was that one Baptist Hicks built, in Clerkenwell, a
Sessions House for the Justices of Middlesex, which
was called after him Hicks' Hall. But Hicks possesses another interest for us besides that which
caused his name to be handed down on the milestones, for this said Baptist Hicks built Campden
House, and thus we feel as much curiosity as the
country pedagogue to know all about him. Baptist
was the son of a rich silk mercer in Cheapside, was
brought up to the business, and made a large fortune.
Part of this fortune he invested in the embellishments
of his signature, an easy matter in those days. King
James the First, "the wisest fool in Christendom,"
was on the throne. King James wanted money, and
he looked about, as persons naturally do when in
want of cash, for something to sell. A clever expedient was hit upon. Titles were put up to sale.
The demand was great at first; but the fees were
heavy, and some economical people refused the

<pb id="p.177" n="177"/>


proffered " Sir." Our canny King James was not to
be baulked. An old statute forcing all persons whereby to take on themselves the dignity of a knight, was
put into force. If people would not pay fees for
receiving knighthood when it was offered to them,
they must pay fines for refusing it; and between the
fines and the fees the king obtained a nice little
addition to his income. On the king's accession, our
Baptist Hicks was made a knight, and some seventeen years later a baronet. The latter title cost a
thousand pounds, besides expenses. In the reign of
Charles I., he was advanced to the peerage as Viscount
Campden, in Gloucestershire. Baptist, however, did
not disdain to keep a sharp eye on the main chance,
and for some time after he had received knighthood
kept his shop.  He denied this, saying that his
servants kept the shop, "though he had a regard to
the special credit thereof," an answer reminding one
of that of the schoolmaster, who said that he did not
keep the school, for the school kept him. In <date value="1612">1612</date>,
Sir Baptist obtained the ground on which Campden
House was afterwards built from Sir Walter Cope
who had erected Holland House some five years

<pb id="p.178" n="178"/>

before. We say obtained, rather than purchased, for
there is an old tradition that it was won from Sir
Walter at a game of skittles. Skittles was a more
fashionable game in England then, and even now
burgomasters and barons may be seen playing at it
in Germany. But the estate was certainly a high
stake to be laid on a game of ninepins, and we give
Sir Walter credit for more sense than to let his pro-
perty be bowled away in that fashion. Be that as it
may, the estate became the property of Sir Baptist, and
Campden House was built by him in the picturesque
style of architecture belonging to that age. On his
death, the eldest of his two daughters, each of whom,
it was said, possessed a fortune of one hundred
thousand pounds, married Lord Noel, who took the
title.</p>
<p>  The third Lord Campden supported the Royalists
in the troubled times of the civil war, and during the
Commonwealth only escaped the loss of his estates
by the payment of a large fine. But when the revolution took place, and "King Charlie got his own
again," the merry monarch honoured Lord Campden
with a special visit, and supped with him in the great

<pb id="p.179" n="179"/>

oak-carved dining room, famous for its wonderful oaken
mantelpiece, and settled Campden House on him and
his heirs for ever. Here, too, died the Earl of Lindsey,
who, when his father was wounded and taken captive
at the battle of Edge Hill, at once yielded himself
prisoner that he might attend on him. The action
might seem slight, but it has been sufficient to hand
his name down to posterity, and to put another link
in the chain of anecdotes that belong to Campden
House.</p>
<p> Some twenty years after this event (in <date value="1691">1691</date>) the
house was hired by the Princess Anne, afterwards
Queen, as a nursery for her son, the young Duke of
Gloucester. He was the heir apparent to the throne,
for William and Mary, the reigning sovereigns, were
childless.  The little Duke was only two years old
when he came to Kensington; a weak, sickly, big-
headed child. The Old Court Suburb was, even then,
recommended by the doctors, and it was perhaps
owing to its healthy air that the child lived as long
as he did. There are few more pathetic histories than
that of the little Duke of Gloucester, and the story
belongs almost entirely to Campden House, for there

he was brought up, and, with the exception of an
occasional visit to Twickenham or Windsor, constantly
resided. There, too, he died.  Queen Anne stayed
there also to watch the growth of her only son.</p>
<p>To outward eyes the life of the prince was such as
to awaken the envy of all the boys of his age. He
had two wooden horses, and a real pony to ride on,
he had a model ship so large that his playfellows could
climb the masts, he had toys that moved and did all
but speak, and, above all, he commanded a real army
of little boys, armed with pikes, muskets, and swords;
this little troop obeyed his orders, they guarded the
gates of Campden House, they had field days in Kensington Gardens, or, as the little prince grew older, on
Wormwood Scrubs; and to make it seem all the more
real, they broke into the houses of the respectable
inhabitants of Kensington, and took whatever they
wanted, just as the real soldiers were breaking into
the houses of poor Flemish peasants abroad. Then
fireworks were let off on every great occasion, for his
special gratification.</p>
<p>On his seventh birthday he was made a knight of the
garter. His dress was crusted with jewels. Was not

<pb id="p.181" n="181"/>

such a life the acme of juvenile felicity? And yet,
notwithstanding all this, the poor little prince was not
happy. He reminds us, in his manners and tastes, of
Dickens's little Paul, in " Dombey and Son." Instead
of Susan Nipper and Wickham, the little prince had
for his governess, Lady Fitzharding, and for his nurse
Mrs. Pack. Little Paul made a confidant of the old
Bath-chairman, and got Glubb to tell him all about
the sea and its wonders. The little prince made a
confidant of his Welsh usher, and got Lewis Jenkins
to tell him why the world was drawn in two round
maps.</p>
<p>Poor little prince. No one understood him with his
queer old-fashioned ways; far beyond his age in intellect, never more than an infant in bodily strength.
He was four years old before he could walk, and five
before he could be forced to go up and down stairs by
himself, and then only when his father, Prince George,
had given him a severe thrashing. There can be little
doubt that he suffered from water on the brain, and
that when he tried to walk up or down stairs by himself his big head became full of feelings, which he, in
his childish way, could not explain. His father's idea


<pb id="p.182" n="182"/>

was that his son, as the heir to the British crown, and
perhaps the leader of the British armies, must be
strong and robust, used to hardships, fond of military
exercises, and that he must not like dancing, or
have a taste for poetry.  But neither beating nor
medicine would make the little prince strong or
robust. Fond of military exercise he certainly was,
and would put up with tolerably rough play. But
any unusual exertion brought on a fit of illness. He
longed to please his father, and he himself wished to
be able to run about and play like other boys. None
could understand why he should not. His mother,
the Princess Anne, watched his every movement, yet
his behaviour was considered the effect of caprice, or
of some passing illness. Many are the little anecdotes
told of him, which remind us so much of those which
Dickens associated with little Paul. Sometimes the
young Duke paid visits to Kensington Palace, when
the King and Queen resided there. But Queen Mary
was not on good terms with her sister Anne, and the
mother never accompanied her child. On one of these
occasions, and before he was five years old, he had
been told that he would be made a Knight of the

<pb id="p.183" n="183"/>

Garter, as he was actually afterwards.  The blue
ribbon then vacant was given to the Duke of Shrewsbury. The Queen offered her little nephew a pretty
bird instead, but the little boy was disappointed, and
refusing the bird, said very calmly " that he would not
rob her Majesty of it."</p>
<p>The first time the little prince put on male
attire was at Easter, <date value="1694">1694</date>. Under his suit of white
camlet with silver buttons he was obliged to wear
stiff stays; the stays hurt, and Mr. Hughes, the tailor,
was sent for, and condemned to condign punishment.
The sentence was that the unlucky tailor should be
put on the top of one of the wooden horses, and it
was to be carried out by the prince's mimic army of
small boys in soldiers' coats. This was not the only
time that offenders were thus condemned by martial
law. On another occasion, when the young prince
lay ill in bed, an automaton toy was sent him from a
lady; the prince's regiment of urchins who kept
guard round his bedside, decided that the present of
a toy to a prince of the mature age of five was an
affront. The toy was torn to pieces, and the messenger
who had brought it, bethinking him perhaps of the


<pb id="p.184" n="184"/>

fate of the tailor, rushed down Campden Hill into
Kensington town, as fast as his legs would carry him;
only, however, to be captured in the course of the
afternoon, and soused all over by the small soldiers
with water from enormous syringes and squirts. In
fact, the bringing up of the heir to the British throne
was in many respects rough. His mother once heard
him state that he was " Confounded dry," and nearly
sent away some of his attendants in consequence.</p>
<p>He had always manifested a reluctance to the religious services, simply, perhaps, because he could not
understand them; and preferred to employ his chaplain in building mimic fortifications to hearing him
read psalms.  But while on a temporary stay at
Twickenham, the old gentlewoman with whom they
lodged taught him the Lord's Prayer and the Ten Commandments. The consequence was that he became
regular in his attendance at church ever afterwards.</p>
<p>When quite a child the young prince showed a
great hankering after knowledge, but was considered
too weak to be taught until he was eight years old.
He went to his Welsh usher for explanations of whatever puzzled him, but Jenkins was forbidden to give

<pb id="p.185" n="185"/>

them. <quote>Lewis,</quote> the little boy would say, <quote>if you will
tell me, no one shall know.</quote> But his governesss, Lady
Fitzharding, found it out, and, considering her province invaded, complained to Anne that the Welsh
usher had dared to teach the child <quote>history, and
mathematics, and stuff,</quote> and a stop was put to these
conversations.</p>
<p>Not long after this event, King William, now a
widower, paid a visit to his sister-in-law, and prattling
with his little nephew, asked him <quote>If he had any
horses yet ?</quote>  <quote>One live horse and two dead ones,</quote>
replied the Duke, meaning his two wooden ones.
The King laughed, and told him <quote>that soldiers always
buried their dead horses out of sight.</quote>  His nephew
took the words in sober earnest, and insisted on the two
wooden horses being buried with due ceremony, and
himself composed some childish rhymes as an epitaph.
His great ambition was to be a soldier, and he used to
tell King William that he and his boy regiments
would go out to Flanders with him and help to fight
the French.</p>
<p>The time, however, was coming when the Duke was
to put away childish things, and his regular education was

<pb id="p.186" n="186"/>

to be commenced. This was confided to Dr. Burnet,
Bishop of Salisbury, while the Duke of Marlborough
was appointed his military tutor.  <quote>My lord,</quote> said
King William  to the latter, <quote>make the Duke of
Gloucester like yourself, and I desire no more.</quote>
Considering the King hated Marlborough like poison,
this was a pretty speech. As for Bishop Burnet, he
wearied the ladies of the Princess's establishment with
his <quote>thundering long sermons,</quote> as we have no doubt
he did the young Duke with long lessons. The Court
ladies did not pay sufficient attention, but the Bishop
had the pews raised so high that they could see
nothing but the preacher,-

        <quote rend="blockquote">I'll build up the pews, that the beauties may see
       <lb/>The face of no brawling pretender but me.</quote>

says a ballad of that time. The fashion of high pews
outlived the Bishop, and perhaps traces of it may
be found in some rural parishes even at the present
day.</p>
<p>The worthy Bishop at once set to work to cram the
Duke of Gloucester, as if he were preparing him for
the Indian Civil Service now-a-days--jurisprudence,
political economy, the feudal system, the Gothic constitution,

<pb id="p.187" n="187"/>


the Greek and Roman histories made up
the " extraordinary mental diet," as Miss Strickland
(to whom we are indebted for many of these anecdotes) calls it, of this prodigy of nine years old. The
four statesmen who periodically examined his progress
confessed themselves astonished at his knowledge. It
was, however, not likely that a weak, sickly child
could stand such mental pressure. We have no doubt
that the poor little fellow's head ached more and more,
that getting up and down stairs became a greater
task than ever, that his little bright flashes of wit grew
fewer, and that he left off his rough play with his
small soldiers, to think in his own way about the
Gothic constitution and the feudal system.  His
eleventh birthday, the <date value="1700-07-24">24th of July, 1700</date>, passed off as
usual, with great rejoicing.  The boy soldiers were
reviewed, his favourite cannon were fired off, and there
were fireworks and a grand banquet.</p>
<p>The little Duke had never shown the gluttonizing
tendencies of his parents; in fact, so little did he care
for food that he had often to be reminded that it was
necessary to eat. Perhaps on this day he was not so
abstemious as usual. He was, at all events, much


<pb id="p.188" n="188"/>


heated and fatigued. The next day he was ill with a
sore throat and headache.  Before night he was
delirious. <quote>We imputed it,</quote> says Bishop Burnet, <quote>to
the fatigue of a birthday, so that he was too much
neglected.</quote> He was bled, by order of the house
physician. The clever but eccentric Dr. Radcliffe was
at once sent for, but, when he heard that the young
Duke had been bled, he refused to prescribe. <quote>You
have destroyed him,</quote> said Radcliffe, <quote>and you may
finish him.</quote> Five days after his birthday, the young
Duke died. His illness was said to be scarlet fever,
but it doubtless originated in that big head, for which,
even at four years of age, no peruke could be found
large enough to fit, and which, with his whole demeanour showed that he had water on the brain.</p>
<p>The poor little prince was probably saved a troubled
life. He had been childishly harmless, but all the
Jacobites, the exiled James at St. Germains, and
Louis XIV. in his imperial palace of Fontainbleau,
rejoiced that the little boy was dead, for the chief
obstacle was now removed out of the way of the
Pretender's succession. Even his uncle, William III.,
was more than two months before he took any notice

<pb id="p.189" n="189"/>

of his nephew's death. Anne mourned for him as
only a mother who had seen the last of her seventeen
children stretched in death can mourn. Such is the
idyll of Campden House and of the Duke of Gloucester. We have, perhaps, given a somewhat longer
account of this portion of the house's history than
usual, but the story is complete in itself, and forms the
most touching, perhaps, of all that we have yet met
with, or are likely to meet with in the course of our
rambles.</p>
<p>Little Campden House, which stands hard by the
larger mansion, was built by Anne to accommodate
her retinue, but after her death it was let as a separate
residence under the name of "The Elms."</p>
<p>To return to the parent building. The next tenants
we meet, after the little Duke and his royal mother,
are the Countess Dowager of Burlington and her scientific son, Richard Boyle; the Boyles having married
into the Noel family. In the latter part of Anne's reign
the house was sold to Nicholas Lechmere, an eminent
lawyer, who became successively Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster and Attorney-General; Lechmere
was a Whig, and it was he who impeached the Earl of

<pb id="p.190" n="190"/>


Derwentwater, after the Jacobite rebellion       of <date value="1715">1715</date>;
but not three months afterwards he opposed his party
on the Bill for Septennial Parliaments. <quote>Lechmere,</quote>
writes a friend to the Whig Ministry, <quote>always damns
everything that does not originally come from himself.</quote>  Swift thus describes him:-

                <quote rend="blockquote">Firm on his front his beaver sate,
                <lb/>So broad, it hid his chin;
                <lb/>For why ? He deem'd no man his mate,
                <lb/>And feared to tan his skin.
                <lb/>With Spanish wool he dy'd his cheek,
                <lb/>With essence oil'd his hair;
                <lb/>No vixen civet cat so sweet,
                <lb/>Nor could so scratch and tear.
                <lb/>Right tall he made himself to show,
                <lb/>Though made full short by God;
                <lb/>And when all other dukes did bow,
                <lb/>This duke did only nod.</quote>
</p>
<p>These verses are taken from       the ballad   of "The
two Dukes." The other duke was Guise, and the
story goes on to tell us how Guise refused an invitation to a quiet rubber at Campden House, and how Lechmere, on receiving the refusal-

               <quote rend="blockquote">In wrath called for his steeds
                 <lb/>And fiercely drove them on :
               <lb/>Lord! Lord ! how rattled then thy stones,
                 <lb/>O kingly Kensington.</quote>


<pb id="p.191" n="191"/>


Lechmere enters Guise's house, tweaks his nose, and
gives him a box on the ear. A challenge, and a duel
ensue, but the worthy proprietor of Campden House,
thinking discretion the better part of valour, sneaks
off from the field of battle in his carriage:-

              <quote rend="blockquote">Back in the dark, by Brompton Park
                <lb/>He turned up through the Gore,
              <lb/>So slunk to Campden House so high
              <lb/>All in his coach and four.
              <lb/>Meanwhile Duke Guise did fret and fume,
              <lb/>A sight it was to see
              <lb/>Benumbed beneath the evening dew
              <lb/>Under the Greenwood tree.</quote>
</p>
<p>How much of the ballad was founded on fact, and
how much of it on fancy, history sayeth not; but we
are afraid there was but one halfpenny worth of truth
to an intolerable deal of fiction. Anyhow we are
much obliged to the incident, for our ramble was
getting musty, and wanted some of Swift's highly
spiced ridicule to make it palatable. During the
middle of the last century, and the commencement of
the present one, Campden House became a fashionable ladies' boarding-school; so fashionable that the
proper way of getting in and out of a carriage was
included in the curriculum, and practised on a dummy;


<pb id="p.192" n="192"/>

while we have a misty recollection of having heard
that even the possession of locks of favourite dogs'
hair was forbidden, as tending, no doubt, to instil
dangerous ideas into the minds of the young ladies.
It was afterwards again used as a private residence
until the <date value="1862-03-23">23rd of March, 1862</date>, when it caught fire,
and before the close of that Sabbath evening, the old
house, where the merry monarch had supped, and an
heir apparent had passed his short, childish life, was
a heap of smoking ruins, leaving nothing but its
memories behind.</p>
<p>It was, says an antiquary of the reign of Anne, <quote>a
very noble pile, and finished with all the art the architects of that time were masters of.</quote> The building
was of brick with stone finishings. The Campden
arms were sculptured above the first floor bay
windows. On the east was the room called Queen
Anne's bed-chamber, which had an arched plaster
ceiling with pendants, while the walls were hung with
red damask tapestry, in imitation of foliage. The
house itself stood in large grounds, the approach to
it being from Kensington, through a long avenue of
elms, which extended nearly to High Street, passing

<pb id="p.193" n="193"/>

through the spot now occupied by the cemetery. One
of the mounds belonging to the Waterworks Company is still traditionally called <soCalled>Queen Anne's
Mound,</soCalled> and is said to have formed part of the
Campden estate. The situation was so warm that
the olive flourished out of doors; and we also read
of a caper tree which had annually produced fruit
without any artificial heat, for more than a hundred
years. At the close of the last century, the land in
front of the house was planted with trees, which nearly
cut off the view from the town, while at the same
time a road was made to the east. Should any of our
readers at any time chance to pass down that road;
we hope that they will look on the new house, built
on the model of the old, with none the less interest,
if they think of the touching story of the young Duke
of Gloucester.</p>

<p>IN our rambles we have sometimes met with places
and names over which we would willingly have
lingered. But when those names were the names of
well-known men who are still among us, or who have
only lately left us, we have either passed by in silence,
or at the most, allowed ourselves only a casual peep,
and we have already in our introduction explained
our reasons for not doing more. There is one house
which must be an exception to our usual practice-
Holly Lodge. It is a comfortable old-fashioned place
standing in its own grounds, situated on the slope of
Campden Hill, and now belongs to the Earl of Airlie.</p>
<p>But for nearly four years, from <dateRange from="1856-05" to="1859-12">May, 1856 to December, 1859</dateRange>, it was in the hands of one whose name


<pb id="p.195" n="195"/>


has often been mentioned in these pages-<persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Thomas
Babington Macaulay</persName>, the most popular historian of
England. We think we have made this exception
not without reason. Mr. Trevelyan's spirited life and
letters of his uncle have provided us with ample materials, while in <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> as we see him at Holly
Lodge, there is nothing to mar, nothing to confuse,
nothing to criticise, so that we need be under no fear
of wounding the feelings of friends or relations. It is
the picture of an author and reader, enjoying himself
as only an author and reader can, and the warm deep
evening glow of a sun that is setting in more than
usual brilliancy, colours such a picture of greatness,
happiness, home life and contentment, as is not often
to be found in the career of a literary man.</p>
<p>In <date value="1856-05">May, 1856</date> then, <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>, still plain Mr., removed from his chambers on the second floor in the
Albany and settled at Holly Lodge, Kensington.
The house had been recommended to him by his old
friend Dr. Millman. The first effect of this recommendation was to set <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> to re-reading and re-criticising the Doctor's book on Latin Christianity, and
the second was the purchase of the lease of the house,

<pb id="p.196" n="196"/>

which latter he pronounced to be  <quote>in many respects,
the very thing.</quote> The rooms it is true, were not for
the most part very large, but that mattered but little,
as <hi rend="italics">the</hi> room of the house-the library, was all that
could be desired. It was a spacious apartment, enlarged by pillared recess, and opening on a beautiful
unbroken slope of verdant green. After an autumn
trip in Germany and Italy, <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> says in one of
his letters <quote>that all the countries through which I
have been travelling could not show such a carpet of
soft rich green herbage as mine.</quote> If this lawn were
not overshadowed by any giants of the forest, of
shrubbery there was abundance. <quote>How I love,</quote> says
the happy proprietor, <quote>my little paradise of shrubs
and turf.</quote> And again in <date value="1857-05">May, 1857</date>, <quote>It is delicious,
the lilacs are completely out; the laburnams almost
completely. The brilliant red flowers of my favourite
thorn tree began to show themselves yesterday. To-day they are beautiful. To-morrow, I daresay, the
whole tree will be in a blaze.</quote> A few days later he
rejoices over the advent of the rhododendrons, and of
the starting into leaf of the mulberry tree, <quote>which
though small, is a principal object in the view of the



<pb id="p.197" n="197"/>

garden from my library window.</quote> That under such
influences <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> should, perhaps for the first time
in his life, turn gardener, is not surprising. The
Christmas holidays, he tells his sister in <date value="1856">1856</date>, have
interrupted his gardening. <quote>I have turned gardener;
not indeed, working gardener, but master gardener.</quote>
Now he directs creepers to be placed round his windows and beds of rhododendrons to be formed round
his fountain, and again he <quote>orders the dead sprigs to
be cleared from the lilacs, and the grass to be weeded
of dandelions.</quote> Yet, sometimes he even took an hour
from his reading to attempt himself to exterminate
these persistent foes.</p>
<p><quote>My dear little Alice,</quote> he writes to his youngest
niece, <quote>I have been living these last ten days like
Robinson Crusoe in his island. I have had no friends
near me, but my books and my flowers, and no enemies
but those execrable dandelions. I thought that I was
rid of the villains; but the day before yesterday,
when I got up and looked out of my window, I could
see five or six of their great, impudent flaring yellow
faces turned up at me.  'Only you wait till I come
down,' I said. How I grubbed them up! How I enjoyed


<pb id="p.198" n="198"/>


their destruction ! Is it Christian like to hate a dandelion so savagely ?  That is a curious question of
casuistry.</quote> <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>'s letters to children must, indeed,
have formed no inconsiderable portion of his correspondence. He was one of those few men who unaffectedly enjoy children's society, who are never tired
of them, who could spend hours with them when
they would grudge a ten minutes to a grown-up person, who can really enter into the mysteries of a
child's world, and can really appreciate a child's
imagination and ideas. <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> had been such a
man all his life. His greater leisure, however, gave
him more time for the indulgence of this love for
children at Holly Lodge. His little niece, Alice, was
an especial favourite. One night he dreamed most
vividly that <quote>Alice came to me with a penitential
face, and told me that she had a great sin to confess;
that 'Pepy's Diary' was all a forgery, and that she
had forged it. I was in the greatest dismay ! 'What!
I have been quoting in reviews and in my history-,
a forgery of yours as a book of the highest authority.
How shall I ever hold up my head again!' I woke
with the fright, poor Alice's supplicating voice still in
my ears.</quote></p>

<pb id="p.199" n="199"/>

<p><soCalled>Uncle Tom</soCalled> was a great favourite with boys and
girls as well as with younger children. He would
play robbers and tigers in a den built up with newspapers behind the sofa, would write valentines, and
nursery rhymes, for those who were somewhat older,
would indite chatty notes to schoolgirls about their
lessons, and criticise classical authors for schoolboys.
He followed the careers of his nephews and nieces
with watchful eyes, with an ear ever ready to receive
their troubles, fears, and hopes, a purse ever open to
purchase toys, to provide treats, and above all to furnish books. <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>'s purse was, indeed, ever in
his hand.  His generosity was unsparing without
being unbounded. Yet if there were faults at all, he
was perhaps too liberal, and during his residence at
Holly Lodge was besieged with applications from
third-rate authors, and a host of people whom he had
never seen. To a clergyman, <quote>a good one, but too
Puritanical for his taste,</quote> he sends twenty-five pounds.
One lady, has thirty-five pounds in a month, another a hundred and thirty pounds in a few months;
to <quote>a bad writer, whom he never saw, fifty pounds in
a few months.</quote> A needy man of letters calls to beg a

<pb id="p.200" n="200"/>

guinea, and is sent away with a hundred pounds.
And such generosity was not confined to moneymatters. He dined each Sunday at his club, marching there in all weathers rather than disturb his servants' Sunday evenings. William and Elizabeth on
one occasion go off to fetch William's father, an old
man with a stick, and the old man is hospitably entertained beneath the roof of Holly Lodge.
 </p><p> That roof, indeed, was well known for its hospitality.
Nothing gave its owner greater pleasure than to see
a few choice spirits gathered round a table laden with
good things. One day it is a gathering of the Fellows
of Trinity College, Cambridge, of which he himself
was one. The party takes place on Lord Mayor's
Day, <date value="1856">1856</date>, and the dinner is well cooked and the
" audit" ale perfect. At another time he would entertain a couple of schoolboys with a dish of mullet, as
a reminder of classical banquets.
 </p><p> These good things were, however, seasoned by what
was still better, a ceaseless flow of anecdote after
anecdote, quotation on quotation, droll comparisons,
jeux d'esprits, and of clear luminous argument and
narrative. It may be true that he engrossed the lion's


                 <pb id="p.201" n="201"/>

share, but one surely would not grudge the lion his
roar, even if by doing so the pigs might have no
opportunity of squeaking.
 </p><p> Such was <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> as he appeared to others; of
his life, lived by himself, he has left many memorials in his diary, and in the notes which cover the
blank spaces of the volumes of his library.
</p><p>  His power of digesting books was enormous, and
while at Holly Lodge he gave that power full play.
 </p><p> A book was always in his hand, or the substance of
a book was always in his mind. He read inside the
house, outside, everywhere. He would walk up and
down the portico " learning by heart the noble Fourth
Act of the Merchant of Venice, or reading pamphlets
of <persName key="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</persName>'s time."
 </p><p> Folios, quartos, and octavos were despatched at
the rate of a volume a day, a whole work in six hours,
The facility with which he read as quickly as other
persons glance over a book, and the ease with which
he remembered what he had so rapidly read, is so
extraordinary, that his diary alone can give any
adequate conception of what his reading was.
 </p><p> He had, besides, greater work in hand; his History,











<pb id="p.202" n="202"/>

a considerable portion of which was penned here. It
was at Holly Lodge, too, that he wrote his articles
on Atterbury, Bunyan, Goldsmith, Johnson, and
William Pitt, of which it is but scant praise to say
that they are probably the finest biographical sketches
of that kind in existence.
 </p><p> His literary career was as successful as it deserved
to be.
 </p><p> On one day-harvest day-as <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> calls it,
<quote>Longmans came with the pleasant announcement
that they would pay twenty thousand pounds into
his account in the following week-all gained by one
edition.</quote> <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>'s first thought was to take a
Paddington omnibus to his sister's home, to impart
the joyful news, to laugh, and to be laughed at.
Rather more than five months afterwards, in
<date value="1857-08">August,1857</date>, came the offer of a peerage, which was accepted.
But such happy days, such triumphant retirement was
not to last long.
 </p><p> Symptoms of illness, <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> had long felt. His
great anxiety was lest they should affect him mentally.
This fear became almost a morbid dread. At one
time, he fears he is losing his German, and reads at




                <pb id="p.203" n="203"/>

once a hundred pages of Schiller to reassure himself.
At another, he commits to memory the entire roll of
the House of Lords, including the second titles, then
the Cambridge and Oxford Calendars. <quote>I have now,</quote>
he says, <quote>the whole of our University Fasti by heart;
all, I mean, that is worth remembering-an idle thing,
but I wished to try whether my memory is as strong
as it used to be, and I perceive no decay.</quote> He learns
line upon line of "Catullus," then three hundred and
sixty lines of " Martial," and his deepest wish is
        <quote rend="blockquote">  "Let me not live
            <lb/>After my flame lacks oil, to be the scoff
            <lb/>Of meaner spirits."</quote>

With <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> at that time, at least, there seemed
but little danger of such a fate. His appetite for
reading, his critical faculties, his powers of memory,
were clear and sharp to the end, and that end was, as
he himself would have wished, sudden. His brotherin-law, Trevelyan, had accepted the Governorship of
Madras, and <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> felt bitterly the approaching
parting with his sister and his sister's family. Books
were his only resource. He read, he noted, he criticised.
He wrote steadily, but with no hope of ever accom





<pb id="p.204" n="204"/>

plishing the period he had proposed in his preface.
The thoughts of the parting, which he attempted to
drive away by work, almost overpowered him. "I
dread the next four months more than even the
months which will follow the separation. This prolonged parting, this slow sipping of the vinegar and
the gall,-is terrible."
  </p><p>The middle of December came and hard frost set
in. <quote>The depression, the weakness, the sinking of the
heart, the incapacity to do anything that required
steady exertion, were very distressing.</quote> Yet he read
German, Latin, and English, and got through the day
tolerably. He felt as if he were dying of old age.
<quote>A month more of such days as I have been passing of late would make me impatient to get to
my little narrow crib, like a weary factory child.</quote>
Before Christmas the frost gave way, the weather was
mild, the sun shone, and <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> ventured into the
verandah; the doctors pronounced the complaint a
heart complaint, and a heart complaint merely. He
writes, <quote>They may be right, but I am certainly very
poorly, weak as a child.</quote> The journal from which we
have so often quoted comes to a close on Friday, the



                 <pb id="p.205" n="205"/>

 <date value="1859-12-23">23rd of December,1859</date>. On that day he did not
exert himself to write, but stayed by the fire making
Christmas calculations, and reading.
  </p><p>This entry concludes with some remarks on the
idea of Dickens' "Harold Skimpole " being meant for
Leigh Hunt. They are as clear, as concise, as logical
as any which the journal contains; yet they form its
last entry.
 </p><p> His sister and her family spent the Christmas
Day with him, and the usual Christmas dinner was
eaten, but <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> spoke but little, and seemed tired
and sleepy. His relations feared for his brain; he
himself more justly for his heart. Christmas Day was
a Sunday. On the following Wednesday, his nephew,
George Trevelyan, called at Holly Lodge late in the
afternoon. He entered the library.  His uncle was
sitting  with the  first number of the Cornhill
Magazine for the ensuing year, open before him, at
the first page of Thackeray's " Lovel the Widower."
But the story was unheeded, and <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> received
his nephew's remarks languidly and drowsily, or with
a loss of self-command, when some painful and pathetic
reflections were suggested to him. His sister came












<pb id="p.206" n="206"/>
later in the evening, and found her brother in the
library as he had been left by his nephew, the Magazine open at the same page-he was dead. He had
attempted with his servant's assistance to move, had
risen, had sat down again, had passed away. The last
time he put his pen to paper was to sign a letter
addressed to a poor curate to whom he was enclosing
twenty-five pounds.  The greatest living English
historian of his time was gone; his work was left unfinished, to command even in its unfinished state, such
popularity as seldom falls to the lot of any historian.
We write at a time too near to the events we have been
depicting to do more than deplore our loss. True,
more than eighteen years have past, but the world
still laments that <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>'s History of England goes
no farther than the death of William the Third, and
with all its faults, for its faults are many, it seems
likely that eighteen centuries hence, some ardent
student of classical literature may close the volume with
a sigh, as he thinks of what prolonged pleasure might
have been yet in store for him, had <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> been
spared for a few years longer to enjoy health, life, and
intellectual vigour at Holly Lodge.</p>

</p><p>HOLLAND HOUSE is the chief glory of Kenna's kingdom; yet it possesses so marked an individuality of
its own, that we might at first feel inclined to fancy
we had over-strayed the boundaries of that kingdom
altogether.  It is like some lofty mountain height,
standing so much apart from the main group as to
seem more like a detached summit than what it really
is-the highest peak of the range.  The only other
building in Kenna's kingdom, which at all approaches
<placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> in point of historical interest, is the
Palace, and the palace falls short-very far short-of
it, in the freshness and pleasantness of its memories.
<placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> will lead us not into what is usually




<pb id="p.208" n="208"/>

considered the historic main road, as the Palace did;
yet we shall fare none the worse for having as companions, authors and statesmen, instead of kings and
queens, for spending our time with the nation rather
than with the court.  The celebrities of Holland
House demand more critical consideration than most
of those whom we have as yet met in our rambles, and
we shall not hesitate to adopt a somewhat graver style
befitting better our new companions. Let us then, as
privileged ramblers, pass through the iron gates which
face Kensington High Road, along the avenue of lofty
elms, and when arrived in front of the house, pause to
take a mental survey of our forthcoming excursion.
</p><p>  At first we may experience some little surprise and
some confusion at the number of persons whom the
enchanter's wand, Memory, calls before us. Moneylenders of the reign of James the First, gallants of the
time of the two Charles', travellers, quakers, seventeenth
century players, roundheads, and cavaliers, Puritans
and Presbyterians, painters, wits, authors, men of
science, men of letters, lawyers, poets, and statesmen.
Take for instance the names of those who are intimately
associated with one apartment alone, the library.




             <pb id="p.209" n="209"/>

Machiavelli, Addison, Lope de Vega, Madame de
Sevigne, Locke, Franklin, the Empress Catherine,
Robespierre.
 </p><p> The various ages, opinions and anecdotes which
such groups of names suggest, may at first sight appear incongruous, but if we throw these nominal
masses into our minds, and allow a few days for the
mental threshing machine to perform its duty, we
shall be surprised to find how the whole jumble has
classified and arranged itself, and now appears to represent a natural sequence of events. This sequence
does not commence until the seventeeth century, for
we do not believe <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> has much association with the nameless traditionary mansion of the
De Veres, of which some traces are said to be still
extant in Holland Park. It owes it origin to one of
the money-lenders of James the First's reign-Sir
Walter Cope. The builder was one John Thorpe, as
is mentioned in the docket of a plan of the house,
preserved by Walpole, which runs, "Sir Walter
Coape's, at Kensington, erected by I. T."; but the
house was afterwards altered and added to by Inigo
Jones and Stone. It was commenced in <date value="1607">1607</date>. Sir




<pb id="p.210" n="210"/>
Walter was, no doubt owing to certain pecuniary
transactions, in good favour with the Court. He was
a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the King. The
old money-lender's daughter Isabella, must have been
considered a catch at the time, for we are told that
the Earl of Carlisle, the all-powerful favourite of the
king, " preferred " his greatest friend, the Earl of Holland, to her hand.
  </p><p>" By this marriage," says Clarendon, "the Earl became possessed of a good fortune, and, amongst other
things, the manor and seat of Kensington, of which he
was shortly made baron."
  </p><p><persName key="Henry Rich">Henry Rich</persName>, first Baron Kensington, then, is the
first well-defined figure which has <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> for
its background. His career is an interesting one. He
was typical of a class of men not uncommon in the
days of the Civil Wars, and by no means extinct.
The earl was younger son of the noble house of Rich;
In his youth he had served as a volunteer in the war
in Holland. The favours, however, which his handsome mien, his winning ways, and fluent tongue, procured him from the king were, joined with his wife's
portion, sufficiently substantial to enable him to



          <pb id="p.211" n="211"/>

abandon the life of a soldier for that of a courtier.
His new occupation suited him well. He was rapidly
advanced to the earldom of Holland, made Captain
of the Guard, Knight of the Order, and of the Privy
Council, while the fact of his having been the Ambassador chosen to treat concerning the King's marriage,
had procured him the good opinion of the Queen.
So long as the nation remained quiet he was distinguished principally by his readiness to carry out
the unconstitutional measures of Charles for his own
profit; yet, when the volcano of rebellion burst forth,
he gave but a half-hearted support to his royal master,
intriguing with the Parliament so as to be ready for
whatever might happen. When the Covenanters encamped at Dunse in <date value="1639">1639</date>, it was Holland who commanded of the royal forces sent to disperse them, and
it was Holland who fled without striking a blow. The
king made him General of the Forces, and the first
use he made of his position was to send words of
warning to the House of Commons, the king's adversaries. When at length Charles' standard was raised
at Nottingham, in  <date value="1642-06">August,1642</date>, Holland was not
among its defenders. But a year later he deserted






<pb id="p.212" n="212"/>
the Parliament, and joined Charles at Oxford. In
this line of conduct he himself saw no reason for
shame, nay, rather he was convinced that the merits
of a deserter far outshone those of a staunch adherent.
Accordingly, having fought bravely in the king's regiment at Newbury, he looked for a restoration of all his
old places and honours; But Charles naturally enough
distrusted him, and was impolitic enough to show that
distrust. Holland's old place of the Groom of the Stole
was not restored to him, but was given to the Earl of
Hertford. Then the Earl again changed sides. Before
he was missed at Oxford, he was in London. He gave
the Parliament to understand that he had deserted
simply to incline his majesty to a treaty of peace, but
finding the king surrounded by evil counsellors, had
returned even at the risk of his life. The Parliament
sequestered his estate, and mistrustingly placed him
in a dishonourable confinement in his own mansion,
<placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>. Five years later, towards the close
of the great struggle, when the turn of affairs must
have convinced the Earl that nothing but danger
could be expected from the party of Cromwell, he
once more declared in favour of the king. He headed




         <pb id="p.213" n="213"/>

a rising of some five hundred men, and was taken
prisoner in a struggle at St. Neots, where some better
men than himself fell.
 </p><p> In the ensuing January Charles was brought to the
scaffold, and shortly afterwards the Earl, too, was
tried and condemned. He vainly endeavoured by his
conciliatory demeanour, by petition, and by interest,
to save his life, but when the end came, he died well
and bravely, making many edifying reflections, and
compounding with the executioner for his "cloathes"
for ten pounds. As the aforesaid " cloathes " included
a white satin waistcoat and white satin cap with silver
lace, the executioner may not have made so good a
bargain. "He was," says Clarendon, who makes
many highly moral remarks on his fate and character,
a very well-bred man, and a fine gentleman in good
times; but too much desired to enjoy ease and plenty
. . . when the king could have neither, and did
think poverty the most insupportable evil that could
befall any man in this world." Had his lot been cast
in less troublesome times, he would probably have
made a good and prosperous lord of the manor of the
Copes, and a successful and honoured courtier. He






<pb id="p.214" n="214"/>

could not, however, bear the fiery ordeal of revolution
and indecision, selfishness, deceit, and want of patriotism are so apparent in his history, that had he not
been so fine a gentleman, and dressed so well, he
would seem a very despicable man indeed. Five
months later <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> had for an occupant,
whether as lodger or temporary possessor, it is difficult
to say, General Fairfax. It is rumoured that in the
July of the same year another parliamentary general.
Lambert, also had quarters here. If tradition say
true, Cromwell too discussed the state of the nation
with Ireton on the lawn. There is at all events no
proof to the contrary.
 </p><p> At length, with unusual lenity the Parliamentarians
allowed the widow of the beheaded Earl to live again
at <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>. Her ladyship appears to have
found time and money for making alterations and
additions, if we may judge by the following inscription on a stone dug up near the stables in <date value="1806">1806</date>.
</p><p>" This side done by ye la. Holland A.D. <date value="1654">1654</date>."
 </p><p> She is also said to have given great encouragement
to the strolling players, who were as much patronised
by the Royalists as they were severely handled by the





              <pb id="p.215" n="215"/>

Puritans.  A statute for their suppression sagely
remarking, " That whereas the acting of Stage Plays,
Interludes, and common Plays is condemned by
antient Heathens (?) it is much less to be tolerated
amongst professors of the Christian religion." During
the time of Lady Holland there was no house in
which the players were more kindly or more
frequently received than in the old manor of the
Copes. Isabella's son, Richard, second Earl of Holland and fifth Earl of Warwick, resided principally there.  His son and successor, Edward,
married Charlotte, daughter of Sir Thomas Middleton,
a lady better known through her second husbandJoseph Addison.  But we have travelled somewhat
too fast, Addison is not on the tapis yet. Holland
House boasts of one or two noteworthy visitors before
him. It seems, indeed, to have been occasionally
let or lent to various personages, among whom at this
period figure the names of Sir John Chardin, Oriental
traveller, and William Penn, Quaker, and founder of
Pennsylvania.
 </p><p> John Chardin was a French Protestant, whom the
revocation of the Edict of Nantes drove to English

<pb id="p.216" n="216"/>
shelter, in <date value="1685">1685</date>.  Here he was well received by
Charles the Second, who knighted him. During his
stay at <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, the place probably became a
temporary museum, and numerous must have been
the visitors who would throng to hear his traveller's
tales. Evelyn tells us that in his lodgings he assumed
the Eastern dress, was a very handsome person,
extremely affable, modest, well-bred, and not inclined
to talk wonders. He spoke Latin, and understood
Greek, Arabic, and Persian, and had travelled throughout those parts of the East where few, if any,
Europeans used to go. He told Evelyn of the fireworshippers in Persia, praised the women of Georgia
as the most beautiful in the world, and remarked that
in the former country there was little use of iron, it
being so moist there that " oyle would not preserve
it from rusting; so that they had neither clocks nor
watches; but some padlocks they had for doores and
for boxes." A daughter was borne here in <date value="1685">1685</date>,
whose name appears in the Parish Register.
  Chardin was apparently succeeded in the occupation of <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> by William Penn. William
Penn has two characters, and it is strange that his


                 <pb id="p.217" n="217"/>

greatest critic, <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>, should himself have been
almost as much connected with <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>
as Penn himself.
 </p><p> Here is Penn's biography in Magnall's questions, the
biography which the children of last generation, and
many of the present, have been, and are taught:</p><p>  "William  Penn, a celebrated Quaker, born in
London, <date value="1644">1644</date>; died, <date value="1718">1718</date>. He colonized the province of Pennsylvania, built the town of Philadelphia,
and was deservedly esteemed by the good of all
persuasions."
 </p><p> Now a few words from    <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> as a commentary.
  </p><p>" Unhappily, it cannot be concealed that he bore a
chief part in some transactions condemned not merely
by the rigid code of the society to which he belonged,
but by the general sense of all honest men."
 </p><p> The aspersions of <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> raised a storm of
opposition, but they have never been disproved, and
the whole affair is a warning against the danger of
hero-worship. History is never tired of showing us
that heroes, such heroes, at least, as man loves to
make of his fellow-man, are few and far between, if











<pb id="p.218" n="218"/>

they exist at all. But Penn, after all, though not a
saint was a good man. He was not, perhaps, quite
the sober Quaker that he is usually represented, and
appears to have lived in considerable style at Holland
House. On some mornings that house was thronged
by not less than two hundred suitors, so that he could
scarcely make his way down the steps. His influence
with the king was great, and, as a rule, he used it
wisely and well. He was a good and great man, and
had people not insisted on canonizing him as a hero,
his faults would never have assumed the glaring proportions into which the revelations of <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> forced
them.
 </p><p> Chronologically, William Penn, as an inmate of
<placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, was succeeded by a man of whom
<persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> formed a very different estimate to that
which he did of Penn. This was Joseph Addison,
poet, essayist, and statesman.
</p><p>  But <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> was a portrait painter who loved to
sketch his characters in black and white; he never
used neutral tint. He has made a moral sweep of
William Penn, he has made a moral miller of James
Addison. Yet to a large, to a very large extent





              <pb id="p.219" n="219"/>

Addison deserves the praise that has been lavished on
him. We are the more careful to admit this as the
poet does not, perhaps, shine his brightest when in
connexion with <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>. His marriage with
the Countess was not a happy one. <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>,
it was said, although a large house, could not contain
Mr. Addison, the Countess of Warwick and one
guest-Peace. The fault seems to have been chiefly
on the lady's side. Addison appears to have formed
her acquaintance whilst residing at Chelsea. We have
elsewhere referred to the tradition that he was tutor
to the Countess's son, the young Earl of Warwick.
The courtship was a lengthy one, disparity of rank
being the obstacle, nor when the union ultimately took
place did this objection disappear. "At length," says
Dr. Johnson, pompously cynical, "the lady was persuaded to marry him, on terms much like those on
which a Turkish princess is espoused, to whom the
Sultan is reported to pronounce 'Daughter, I give
thee this man for thy slave.'" In our own day it
would scarcely be considered a mesalliance for a
Countess to marry the son of a Dean and landholder in
Warwickshire, the brother of the Governor of Madras,












<pb id="p.220" n="220"/>

and the first writer of his age, who besides had filled
some of the highest posts in the Civil Service of his
country, and who, not long after the marriage became
Secretary of State. A disparity between the Dowager
Countess of Warwick and Addison !-a great one
truly-for the lady owes the circumstance of her
name being still remembered to the fact that the despised commoner was her husband. Poor Addison,
always shy and mild, was henpecked and, if tradition say true, would often spend his evenings in the
little neighbouring inn, the Holland Arms, where he
and some of the friends of his bachelor days might
enjoy a bottle of claret and a little literary conversation. It is as the death-place of the great writer that
<placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> is chiefly celebrated. Here, on the
 <date value="1719-06-17">17th of June,1719</date>, he died, deeply regretted by his
friends, and by none more so than Tickell, whose
lines on the subject are worth reading, as the following extract will show:     <quote rend="blockquote"> "Thou Hill-whose brow the antique structures grace
<lb/>Rear'd by bold chiefs of Warwick's noble race,
      <lb/>Why, once so lov'd, whene'er thy bower appears,
      <lb/>O'er my dim eyeballs glance the sudden tears !
      <lb/>How sweet were once thy prospects fresh and fair,
      <lb/>Thy sloping walks, and unpolluted air !


                     <pb id="p.221" n="221"/>

        <lb/>How sweet the glooms beneath thy aged trees,
        <lb/>Thy noontide shadow and thy evening breeze !

        <lb/>No more the summer in thy glooms allay'd,
        <lb/>Thy evening breezes, and thy noonday shade.</quote>

 </p><p> The story of Addison's death-bed is well known,
to some portions of it we have already alluded.      How
serenely he died; how he is said to have attempted to
read  a lesson  to  his step-son, the young       Earl of
Warwick, in the     memorable    words "See in      what
peace a Christian can die," how he sent for Gay, the
poet, to <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, and implored his forgiveness
for some wrong which Addison had, or fancied he
had, inflicted on his brother poet, and the secret of
which is unknown to the present day, and how in his
forty-eighth year the great essayist passed away, with
the peaceful trust in God of some little sinless childall this, and more than this has been told and retold,
and is still worth the telling.  Addison was buried in
Westminster Abbey.</p><p>

     <quote rend="blockquote">   " Ne'er to these chambers where the mighty rest,

 </p><p> This of course is the partiality of friendship and the
license of a poet.
 </p><p> A great poet Addison was not. He was no orator;
he showed but little talent as a statesman, his
dramatical productions, regarded from a dramatic
point of view, were but second rate; his learning
though extensive, was not remarkable. Yet as a writer
of pure, clear, lucid English prose, he is probably
unequalled. He was almost the originator of the
essay, he was a humorist of the first water, and a
satirist without being a cynic. He was a sincere
moralist, a brilliant conversationalist, and a good man.
His influence on the men and manners of his age was
as great as the influence of any writer on the men and
manners of any particular age has been, and it was an
influence that was always exerted in the cause of
morality, of humanity, and of learning. It was
however, only among his chosen friends that his
sparkling wit and conversational wealth displayed
themselves. With strangers he was mute, and in his
own words "he could draw a bill for a thousand
pounds, though he had not a guinea in his pocket."
Indeed Lord Chesterfield declares that 'he was the



           <pb id="p.223" n="223"/>

most timorous and awkward man that he ever saw."
 </p><p> Many memorials of Addison are treasured at <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, and most of the rooms are more or less
connected with his name. There is the present
dining room, a fine old fashioned apartment, with
richly laden sideboard, and pictures by <persName key="Sir Joshua">Sir Joshua</persName>
Reynolds, Kneller, and Lely-here Addison died.
There is the library, upwards of ninety feet in length,
bay-windowed at either end, containing within its
bookcases treasures priceless to the antiquary, the bibliomaniac, and the literary man, manuscripts of Lope
de Vega, music copied by Jean Jaques Rouseau, when
he in this manner, earned a miserable subsistence, and
books of value innumerable. To this room belongs
the story of Addison's pacings to and fro, with a bottle
of wine at either end, and assisting the muse, by
regularly taking a glass from each bottle. The story
may or may not be true. Horace Walpole, indeed,
caps the touching account of his death as commonly
received, with the sarcastic words, " Unfortunately, he
died of brandy." The brandy, at all events, if it did
not assist, at least did not spoil Addison's papers in
the Spectator Considering the habitual intemperance






<pb id="p.224" n="224"/>
of the age in which he lived, Addison does not seem
to have drunk more, or so much as most of his contemporaries, which is but a faint qualification, if any at
all. In this same apartment, the library, is preserved
Addison's table, small, simple, and ink-blotted, and
in the library passage is a portrait of him. But there
have not been wanting cavillers to prove that the
portrait is not the portrait of Addison, but of somebody else, so that we leave our readers to decide here
as they choose, just as in the case of the brandy story.

</p><p>With the Foxes, commences a new era in the history
of the mansion. This family settled here about the
middle of the eighteenth century, and the house remains in their hands at present. The founder of the
House of Fox, a House afterwards dignified with the
title of Holland, was Stephen, a choir-boy in Salisbury
Cathedral, perhaps, at first, a footman, but afterwards
employed in a much higher position in the household
of Lord Percy, Chamberlain to the King. Stephen
became an adherent of the exiled House of Stuart,
and was fortunate enough to be first to announce the
death of Oliver Cromwell to Charles the Second.
When Charles returned to our island a place was




         <pb id="p.227" n="227"/>

found for Stephen, and from that time he rose surely
and swiftly, holding office under no less than four
sovereigns-Charles II., James II., William III., and
<persName key="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</persName>. There are still preserved in Holland
House two chests, popularly termed Stephen Fox's
money chests, perhaps used for keeping official papers.
But Stephen has no further connection with Holland
House than as the founder of the family, and it is to
his second son, Henry, that we must turn as the first
Fox who actually possessed the mansion.
 </p><p> Henry Fox occupies a prominent position among
the statesmen of the eighteenth century. He was
possessed of many natural advantages, but hampered
also by many natural disadvantages. His figure was
ungraceful, his manner awkward, while when he spoke
in public he often stammered and hesitated, and his features were forbidding almost to repulsiveness. Pitt
once declared that he looked as if he had murdered
some one under a hedge; Pitt with his graceful figure
and fluent high toned oratory could well afford to
ridicule his rival on such points. But in some qualities Henry Fox was superior, far superior, to William
Pitt, the great commoner. His accuracy, his power






<pb id="p.228" n="228"/>

of arrangement, his manly sense, his wit, discernment
and satirical talent, were of the highest order. Fox,
indeed, we think, narrowly missed being a very great
statesman, perhaps a greater statesman than Pitt himself. Want of settled principles and want of political
honesty were the great deficiencies in his character.
He had been bred in the political school of Sir Robert
Walpole, whose cardinal maxim was, that every man
had his price. Fox had the highest opinion of Sir
Robert, and of all his pupils he was the one who in
corruption and bribery most out-Walpoled Walpole.
He behaved in a manner which would not be tolerated for a week in our own times, and which even in
the far less scrupulous age in which he lived was regarded by the great mass of the people with disapprobation and disgust. No one had confidence in him.
He was a cool, calculating, selfish politician; "without
any notion of or regard for the public good or the
constitution." The tenacity with which he clung to
office was extraordinary. Walpole made him a Lord
of the Treasury and afterwards Secretary of War.
This latter place he managed to retain when Walpole
was driven from office by Carteret, when the ministry



                 <pb id="p.229" n="229"/>

of Carteret was succeeded by the ministry of Henry
Pelham, and when Henry Pelham's brother, the Duke
of Newcastle, was at the head of the State. In June,
<date value="1757">1757</date>, he was very nearly forming a ministry in conjunction with Lord Waldegrave; but popular feeling
was in favour of Pitt, on whom the City Companies
"rained gold boxes."  Fox deemed it wiser to abandon the attempt, and the first administration of Pitt
the Elder was formed, in which Fox accepted the
subordinate but lucrative post of Paymaster of the
Forces. This post he held during the two Whig administrations of Pitt, during the Tory government of
Bute, and again under Grenville, the Whig. The
Universal Magazine, for  <date value="1757-06">June,1757</date>, somewhat ironically congratulates Fox on his choice of the safer if
less honourable post.

 </p><p> The author, it will be observed, seems particularly
struck with the snugness of the place.
</p><p>  In politics, Fox was perfectly fearless. He it was,
who in direct opposition to the wishes of the nation,
carried the Peace of Paris in <date value="1763">1763</date>, and this he did
with the understanding that a peerage was to be the
reward of his services. That honour, grudgingly given,
was the title of Lord Holland, which he took from
<placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, having purchased the mansion shortly
before.   Still, Fox was not satisfied, he appears
to have expected an earldom, and some four years
later applied to his ancient rival and enemy, William
Pitt, now Lord Chatham, for that favour. It was not
granted. Two years after his elevation to the peerage, he resigned the Paymastership of the Forces, and
retired completely into private life. He carried with
him the unsparing hatred of the public. Their opinion
is well typified by the verses of Gray, suggested by a
view of the mimic ruins which Lord Holland, now
eccentric, and lavish in gratifying his eccentricities,
had erected at Kingsgate in the Isle of Thanet.

  </p><p> We need scarcely say that Fox was far from
  deserving such harsh epithets, and that the poet has
exaggerated, but Lord Holland himself complains of
the desertion of his friends in the following verses:
       <quote rend="blockquote">"White livered Grenville, and self-loving Gower

         <lb/>Lost promised hope of my declining years !"</quote>


                 <pb id="p.233" n="233"/>

 </p><p> Strange to say, Rigby was the most worthless of
all his friends.
 </p><p> It is with considerable relief that we turn
from Lord Holland as he appears in English
political history, to Henry Fox as he appears in his
home life. In that private life he displayed the same
fearlessness, good sense and humour that distinguished
him as a politician, and he was besides the most devoted of husbands and the most fond of fathers. The
history of his marriage contains ample materials for a
three volume novel. He had the audacity to fall in
love with Lady Caroline, eldest daughter of the Duke
of Richmond, and he had the good fortune to find his
love returned. The parents of the young lady were
furious at the presumption of a younger son of an upstart house, but the lovers did not wait to obtain their
sanction. In the month of  <date value="1744-05">May,1744</date>, a month when,
according to the Spectator, Cupid exercises a more than
usual power, Lady Caroline eloped with Mr. Fox;
shortly before the elopement took place, her parents
had arranged to present her to an eligible suitor, but
the young lady in desperation shaved off her eyebrows. The presentation was deferred, and before it



<pb id="p.234" n="234"/>

could take place, Lady Caroline Lennox was Lady Caroline Fox. Then there was hub-bub and weeping among
the aristocratic Richmonds, the illegitimate descendants
of Charles the Second, and among their friends. Letters
of condolence came in from every side, even from the
brother of the culprit himself. Horace Walpole, indeed, having heard that the Duke and Duchess made
it a point that none of their friends should visit the
newly married couple, sent word that he would therefore pay them his compliments as soon as possible,
and another wit, Hanbury Williams, congratulated
Fox with more sincerity on having made a very prudent match. The "unfortunate affair" was discussed
everywhere.  Lord Carteret said that in passing
through the rooms of <placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName> he encountered two statesmen discussing the awful intelligence
in a manner which made him fancy that our fleets and
armies were beat, or were betrayed into the hands of
the French, instead of two people married to each
other against their parents' consent. That consent
was at length tardily and reluctantly given, and not
until four years after the marriage. Lady Caroline
was an excellent wife, Henry Fox an excellent husband,

               <pb id="p.235" n="235"/>

 and their union a most happy one in all respects.
Their domestic happiness continued until the death of
Lord Holland, thirty years after. Lady Caroline survived him but twenty-five days. Lord Holland died
at <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, and one of his dying injunctions
was at the same time one of his best "bon mots."
His friend, Selwyn, was renowned for his wit and
eccentricities.  Among the latter was his morbid
taste for funerals, coffins, corpses, and executions.
Fox's remark on hearing that Selwyn had called
to inquire after him, was, "If Mr. Selwyn calls
again, let him in; if I am alive, I shall be very
glad to see him, and if I am dead, he will be very
glad to see me."  The good qualities of Henry
Fox are so numerous as to incline us to forget
his political failings; failings which it must be remembered were the failings of the age in which he lived
and the political school to which he belonged. His
fearlessness in avowing his own want of political
morality, probably gained him a worse character than
the deficiency itself. He looked on politics as a trade
in which the chief object was the acquisition of wealth,
honours, and estates, and his political career, regarded




<pb id="p.236" n="236"/>

from his own point of view, was a success. The following estimate formed by an anonymous writer of
his character, may induce us to forget the bitterness
expressed in the lines quoted above from Gray.-" He
was an excellent husband, a most indulgent father, a
kind master, a courteous neighbour."</p>

</p><p>IN the Joshua Room at <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, a room hung
with the works of the great portrait painter, is a picture of the first Lord Holland. In this portrait the
features are coarse but not unpleasing, and the face is
full of power. In this room also hangs one of Sir
Joshua Reynolds' most famous pictures, containing
the portraits of Lady Sarah Lennox (the sister of
Lady Holland), who is leaning out of a window at
<placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, and those of her nephew Charles
James Fox, and his cousin Lady Susan Strangeways.
Each of these persons contributes a link to the chain
of <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> history. To commence with Lady
Sarah, who as one of <persName key="Sir Joshua">Sir Joshua</persName>'s favourite sitters,



<pb id="p.238" n="238"/>

and also as the most graceful of the three figures,
demands primary consideration, even if chronology
did not, as it does, furnish another powerful argument
in her favour. The great event in Lady Sarah's life
is George the Third's attachment for her. In her
childhood she attracted the notice of that monarch's
grandfather, George the Second. It is said that the
little girl was walking with her aunt and governess in
Kensington Gardens on one of the days when the
Royal Family promenaded on the broad walk. The
little Lady Sarah, with childish naivete, suddenly broke
from her conductress and bounding up to the King,
asked him in French, how he did, and remarked what
a large and beautiful palace he had. George the
Second, amused and interested, frequently had the
little Lady Sarah brought to the palace for his amusement. On one occasion, so her son tells us, the King
in the midst of a romp, caught hold of the little girl
and depositing her in a large china jar shut down the
cover, while she beguiled her momentary confinement
by breaking out into the popular French song of
"Malbruc." In consequence of her mother's death she
was placed under the charge of her elder sister who re
           <pb id="p.239" n="239"/>

sided in Ireland, and did not return to <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>
until the age of thirteen. The King soon afterwards
expressed a wish to see his little playmate, but was
much disappointed to find that the five year old romp
had become a demure, timid, though very pretty girl.
" Pooh !" said George the Second, "she's grown quite
stupid." But his grandson and heir, the Prince of
Wales, thought otherwise, and fell headlong in love
with her, a love which lasted until he became King,
when he seems seriously to have thought of making
her Queen. Lady Sarah, for whatever reason, does
not appear to have encouraged his advances, and his
advisers almost unanimously dissuaded him from such
an unusual step. Henry Fox, indeed, not yet Lord
Holland, hoped that his sister-in-law might become
Queen of England. According to Horace Walpole,
when he went to the seaside "he left her at Holland
House, where she appeared every morning in a field
close to the great road (where the Kirg passed on
horseback) in a fancied habit, making hay." But this
royal love idyll was soon at an end. King George bebecame the husband of Charlotte of Mecklenburgh
Strelitz, and Lady Sarah the wife of the black-leg, Sir











<pb id="p.240" n="240"/>

Charles Bunbury, M.P. Lady Sarah was probably
the heroine of the song, "On Richmond Hill there
lives a lass," and is described by her brother-in-law
as being prettier than any other girl he ever saw.
</p><p>  The remaining female figure in <persName key="Sir Joshua">Sir Joshua</persName>'s picture
is equally the subject of a Love Romance, and it is
again disparity of rank that gives interest to the story,
only this time the advantage of position is on the side
of the lady. Lady Susan was niece to the first Lord
Holland, and spent much of her time at Holland
House. Between her and Lady Sarah a great intimacy existed, and on the marriage of George the
Third, the latter wrote to her friend to tell her she
had luckily never loved but only liked the King,
and that the title had never weighed anything with
her. When they were both quite young, Walpole
gives us an account of some private theatricals at
<placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, in which the two girls and Charles
James Fox acted together.
 </p><p> Lady Susan seems to have preserved a penchant
for the drama, for not long after the end of the loveepisode between the King and her friend, the world of
fashion was startled by the news that Lord Holland's

                <pb id="p.241" n="241"/>

niece had eloped with a well-known actor named
O'Brien. About a week before this finale, her father,
Lord Ilchester, had discovered the attachment. A
few days later Lady Susan became of age, and on
the day following her birthday, walked down stairs
accompanied by her footman, and said she was going
to breakfast with Lady Sarah. Once in the street
she sent back the footman to fetch something she
professed to have left behind, saying she would wait
until his return. "O'Brien was waiting in a hackney
coach, which she got into, and they went to Covent
Garden Church and were married." Actors were not
much thought of socially in those days, and Horace
Walpole declares it would have been better if the man
had been what the young lady's grandfather, Stephen
Fox, is said to have been, a footman, because "an
actor is too well known to be smuggled in among
gentlefolks."
 </p><p> The married life of the couple, passed in America,
was more happy and respectable than that of Lady
Sarah and her black-leg baronet. But there was of
course an outcry among the fashionables of that age,
and a recent authoress, a connection of the Fox's


<pb id="p.242" n="242"/>

seems inclined to look upon the social desolation thus
brought into the house of Fox, as a Divine retribution
for the similar degradation inflicted by Henry Fox on
the house of Lennox twenty years before. At all
events there appears to have been a fatality for unequal matches at <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, and it is sad to
think that such men as Addison and Henry Fox,
the one a mere poet, the other at the time of his
marriage a mere statesman, should have married, the
one the widow of an Earl; the other the daughter of
a Duke; and that worst of all, a popular actor should
have run away with the granddaughter of a footman !
  </p><p>Let us turn to the third and last figure in the picture-the portrait of Charles James Fox, second son
of the first Lord Holland. A century ago this name
would have awakened such an echo of enthusiasm and
party feelings as is now hard to realise. To-day the
name falls somewhat coldly on the world; yet, if we
were to judge by the contemporary fame which <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> celebrities have enjoyed, Charles James
Fox is the most distinguished of the many distinguished men who are associated with the old manor of
Sir Walter Coope.  That association, however, is






           <pb id="p.243" n="243"/>

principally confined to Charles' childhood. The future statesman was a spoilt child. We have noticed
how kind and indulgent a father was the first Lord
Holland-sometimes this indulgence was carried too
far. Once a wall had been condemned, and Lord
Holland had promised his son, Charles, that he should
see it pulled down: but it happened that the wall was
demolished and rebuilt during the boy's absence,
Lord Holland, to keep his promise, had the newly
raised portion knocked down for the edification of his
son. The sacredness of a promise may be pleaded in
excuse for the father's compliance, but in other cases
no such justification can be alleged. Once Charles
expressed a wish to smash a watch, "Well," said Lord
Holland, "if you must-you must," and the watch
was smashed. Once again, Charles had the temerity
to burn an important dispatch which Lord Holland
had prepared in his official capacity as Secretary of
State, and which did not meet with the approval of
his critical and wayward son. The offence was unpunished and unreproved by the over-indulgent father
As Charles Fox grows older, we at <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>
see less of him. One day he and a friend walked






<pb id="p.244" n="244"/>

thither from Oxford,-fifty miles on a hot day; on
arriving Charles addressed his father, who was drinking his coffee: "you must send half-a-guinea or a
guinea, without loss of time, to the ale-house keeper
at Nettlebed, to redeem the gold watch you gave me
some years ago, and which I have left in pawn there
for a pot of porter." The child was father to the man,
and Fox was in after-life distinguished almost as
much for his reckless extravagance as for his Parliamentary eloquence. That eloquence, which, though
as yet immature, showed promise of rare excellence,
was at first displayed on the Tory side of the House,
for Charles James Fox and his elder brother Stephen
both entered Parliament as adherents of their father's
old party. In the affair of Wilkes and the Middlesex
election, his voice and vote were found on the unconstitutional side. In the year following (<date value="1770">1770</date>) he took
office as a Junior Lord of the Admiralty, resigned two
years later, again took office as one of the Lords of
the Treasury in <date value="1773">1773</date>, and in the February of the year
ensuing was dismissed. In that year, it will be remembered, Lord Holland died. His son, dismissed
by one party, took refuge with the other, and if we

             <pb id="p.245" n="245"/>

cannot but ascribe this sudden change partly to
motives of pique, it must on every hand be admitted
that Fox at length found himself in the party most
suitable to his nature and views. Gibbon, at the time
of Fox's resignation of the Junior Lordship of the
Admiralty, wrote as follows: " Yesterday, Charles Fox
resigned the Admiralty. He has commenced patriot,
and is already attempting to pronounce the words
country, liberty, corruption, and so forth,-with what
success time will determine." If we turn to the inscription on the cast of Westmacott's statue of Fox in
the Garden of <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, we shall find the following answer to the above question. " Charles James
Fox, whom all nations unite in esteeming to have
been the chief man of the people; " an answer may be
equally found in the flattering verdict of Sidney Smith,
who says that "the great feature of Mr. Fox's life was
the long and unwearied opposition which he made, to
the low cunning, the profligate extravagance, the sycophant mediocrity, and the stupid obstinacy, of the English Court." It was in this eventful year ( 774) of Fox's
life that this opposition commenced. And it was literally a " long and unwearied opposition," for, with the




<pb id="p.246" n="246"/>
exception of the few months in <date value="1782">1782</date> when Fox was
Foreign Secretary in the Rockingham Ministry, the few
months of his coalition with Lord North in the ensuing
year, and the few months before his death, in  <date value="1806">1806</date>, when
he was Foreign Secretary in the Grenville Ministry, he
occupied the Opposition Benches for the remaining
thirty-two years of his life. The only time during that
period in which he can be charged with having deserted
his principles is during his coalition with Lord North,
and that charge appears to us but too true. Twelve
months before that coalition, Fox, inveighing against
North in the House of Commons, uttered the following words: "From the moment when I shall
make any terms with one of them, I will rest satisfied
to be called the most infamous of mankind. I could
not, for an instant, think of a coalition with men who,
in every public and private transaction as Ministers,
had shown themselves void of every principle of honour
and honesty. In the hands of such men I would not
trust my honour even for a minute." Within less than
a year Fox placed his honour in the hands of the chief
of these men for an indefinite period; a period, however, destined to last for little more than a twelve
              <pb id="p.247" n="247"/>

month, the "coalition" Ministry being replaced by
that of Fox's younger and more successful rival, William Pitt, who put an end to "this ill-omened and
unnatural marriage." With these two exceptions, his
change of opinions in <date value="1774">1774</date>, and his coalition with
North in <dateRange from="1782" to="1783">1782-3</dateRange>, the political life of Fox was throughout consistent. The first of these changes needs no
excuse; every man has a right to alter his opinion;
the second we are afraid cannot be so easily justified.
 </p><p> The Coalition Ministry was of short duration. In
the December of the following year, Fox found himself
once more in opposition, and his younger rival, William Pitt, at the head of the State. But Fox, in
opposition, was more successful than was Pitt, during
the latter portion of his Ministry, in power. His name
was already revered as the champion of liberty in
America. During the unfortunate war between England and that country, he had not hesitated to espouse
the cause of the revolted Colonies, and had even gone
so far as to bitterly revile the citizens of Manchester and
the people of Scotland, who had been foremost in
subscribing sums to raise new regiments for the support
of what they considered the national honour, and Fox




<pb id="p.248" n="248"/>
as the national disgrace. If Fox saw with perfect
clearness the absurdity and wrong of the War, he
might yet have pardoned, instead of reviled, the spirit
which found it impossible to rejoice in national defeat,
even though suffered in an unrighteous cause. With
regard to the justice of Fox's views on the War itself
there can be little question. Not so with regard to
the justice of his views on another and more momentous struggle--that of England and of Europe
against the mad ambition of the First Napoleon.
But to Charles Fox, Napoleon was an angel of
liberty, and the English Statesman soon became
almost as popular in France, with which his country
was engaged in a desperate struggle to assert
her freedom, as he had   been in America, when
England had attempted to tyrannize over the
Colonists. " To ape Mr. Fox," says a writer on the
Georgian Era, "was now the fashion at Paris; his
dress, his mode of speaking, nay, his very dinners were
imitated. It was the fashion to be a thinking manto think like Fox."
 </p><p> In <date value="1806">1806</date>, Pitt, worn out by the disasters which
threatened to transform the map of Europe into one

                 <pb id="p.249" n="249"/>

huge France, died, and the " Ministry of all the
Talents" succeeded him. In that Ministry Fox was
Foreign Secretary, but before the year was out, he,
too, was in the grave. He was still, comparatively
speaking, young when he died-fifty-eight years of
age; but perhaps his early death was no misfortune
to his fame, for it is hard to see what part the professed champion of liberty and the devoted admirer of
Napoleon could have taken in the great struggle
between Liberty and Napoleon, which forms European
History during the commencement of the nineteenth
century.
  </p><p>The virtues of the second son of Lord Holland were
those in which his father had been wanting-sincerity
of purpose, political consistency, unselfishness, freedom
from mercenary considerations. But he wanted the
sound good sense, the profound insight into men and
manners, the statesmanship, and the shrewd foresight,
which rendered the first Lord Holland so remarkable
a man. Charles James Fox is by far the more popular
of the two; we are inclined to think Henry Fox was
the more talented. Charles James Fox's principal
gift was his oratory, and there can be no doubt that

                  <pb id="p.251" n="251"/>

anything but praiseworthy, and probably nothing so
much weakened the effect of the principles which he
enunciated in his clear and sparkling eloquence, as the
knowledge of his dissolute and extravagant conduct.
As he grew older, his habits became more settled and
domestic, and his courteous manners, and many
generous and amiable qualities, endeared him to a
large circle of sincere friends. The account of his
death-bed is touching, as such accounts usually are,
but more, it shows that whatever may have been the
case in his youth, at the time of his death he was on
the most affectionate terms with his wife. If we mentally translate the word patriot by "cosmopolitan,"
we shall find the following poetical estimate of his
character not a very untrue one:        <quote rend="blockquote">  "A patriot's even course he steered,
            <lb/>'Midst factions wildest storms unmoved;
            <lb/>By all who marked his mind revered
            <lb/>By all who knew his heart, beloved."</quote>
</p><p>His heart, indeed, was the best part about him, and
was a very sensitive one. Not long before his death
he paid a visit to the home of his boyhood, and noticed
observingly and affectionately all the well-remembered
spots at <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>.




<pb id="p.250" n="250"/>

he was one of the most brilliant debaters, and one of
the most successful orators, that England has ever
seen. As an author he did not succeed; his " History
of James the Second," of which much was hoped, was
a failure, and is now little read. But it was in private
life that Charles Fox was principally loved. True, he
was a reckless spendthrift-an untiring gambler; "a
man of pleasure, ruined by the dice-box and the turf,"
yet his many generous, open-hearted, and congenial
qualities, endeared him to friends and enemies alike.
His ideas were free and extensive, and he never feared
to embrace the side of liberty, wherever he believed
it to be, though, unfortunately, he sometimes mistook the shadow for the name, and saw a liberator in
Napoleon the First.
 </p><p> His enthusiasm, indeed, frequently made him forget
that patriotism, like most virtues, may be practised as
well at home as abroad, and he did not scruple to
grieve openly at British victories, and exult at British
defeats-an extent of cosmopolitan philosophy which
borders very closely on unpatriotism. What he believed
to be right he did, earnestly and heartily, fearless of
all consequences. As a young man his private life was</p>

</p><p>WE have already had occasion to mention the name
of Stephen Fox, second Lord Holland. As, however,
we do not wish to speak of persons because they lived
in <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, but rather of <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> because celebrities resided there, we shall not have
occasion to refer to Stephen again. This good-natured,
whimsical, apoplectic second lord was succeeded by
his son <persName key="Henry Rich">Henry Rich</persName>ard, who was only thirteen months
old at the time of his father's death. Of Richard's
political life little need be said. Like his uncle Charles,
he was a staunch believer in Bonaparte, and like him,
too, his sympathies were always on the side which he
believed just or generous. The multitude of his pro
          <pb id="p.253" n="253"/>

tests against those measures of the House of Lords
which he thought unjust or ungenerous, have caused
Leigh Hunt to nickname him the " Protestant Peer."
He dabbled in literature, and published some translations of Spanish comedies, in an age when a knowledge of Spanish was certainly a most unusual
acquirement in a peer of the realm. He had, in fact,
spent some considerable time in Spain and in Italy.
In the latter country he met the future Lady Holland,
then the wife of Sir Godfrey Webster. Lady Webster
was divorced, and married to Lord Holland in <date value="1797">1797</date>.
From henceforth, <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, restored and refitted,
became the centre of the higher London intellectual
society. To have the entree into that salon was more
than a sufficient passport into any other. An invitation to <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> was something to which the
young author might look forward, as a modern Frenchman does to one of the Forty Chairs in the Academic
Francaise. Never in England has a more brilliant
literary circle been gathered together, and Sidney
Smith, in one of his letters, declares " that five hundred
travelled people assert that there is no such agreeable
house in Europe as <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>." The dinner


<pb id="p.254" n="254"/>

parties there were of world- wide celebrity. Let us
attempt to reproduce a faint image of one of them.
It is a Saturday in the middle of  <date value="1832-08">August,1832</date>; the
hour is seven-the <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> dinner hour. It
is thought a generally inconvenient one, and Talleyrand declared that it was adopted by Lady Holland,
"pour gener tout le monde." The dining-room is a
"fine long room, the wainscot of which is rich with
gilded coronets, roses, and portcullises." On the right
hand side, as the dinner party enters from the Crimson
Drawing Room, the twilight still steals in from the
large bay window, which commands a pleasing view
of the garden. Opposite this window stands an oldfashioned sideboard, its shelves laden with glittering
old family plate, salvers, tankards, and vases.  A
closet, filled with gay oriental china, and a huge
looking-glass, form the most conspicuous breaks in
the crimson damask-covered walls, which, indeed, are
besides, largely hidden beneath portraits.  Among
these is a <persName key="Sir Joshua">Sir Joshua</persName>, another of old Stephen Fox, by
Lely, and one of Stephen's wife, by Kneller. A
handsome chandelier, with many brightly-burning
candles, hangs from the starry ceiling. The guests





            <pb id="p.255" n="255"/>

are seated. There is the Mistress of the house, imperious, fidgety, but a woman of " considerable talents
and great literary acquirements," a woman who led
the conversation, or who at least thought she did so.
"The centurion did not keep his soldiers in better
order than she keeps her guests." It is to one, "Go, and
he goeth "; and to another, " Do this," and it is done.
Ring the bell,   Mr. <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>."  Now, we have had
enough of this-give us something else." "Lay down
that screen, Lord Russell; you will spoil it."
 </p><p> " When young she must have been a most beautiful
woman. She still looks, however, as if she had been
handsome, and shows in one respect great taste and
sense. She does not rouge at all; and her costume
is not youthful, so that she looks as well in the morning as in the evening. Her Ladyship, for an esprit
fort, is the greatest coward. She is frightened out of
her wits by thunder; has all the shutters closed, the
curtains drawn, and orders candles in daylight, to
keep out the lightning, or rather the appearance of the
lightning.  When choleraphobia was rampant, she
was in a terrible taking about the cholera; refused
to cat any ice, because somebody said that ice was











<pb id="p.256" n="256"/>

bad for the cholera. She is frightened out of her wits
by hearing a dog howl."
 </p><p> Many, indeed, are the retorts which her Ladyship
provokes, among occasional, as well as among her
more intimate friends. "<placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>," a friend of
Granville Penn's remarked to him, "is really a most
pleasant place; and in Lord Holland's company you
might imagine youself inside the house of Socrates."
The reply is said to have closed the door of Holland
House to Mr. Penn for ever. "It certainly always
seemed so to me, for I often seemed to hear Xanthippe
talking rather loud in the adjoining room."  Ugo
Foscolo was even more decided in his aversion to the
wife of his friend, remarking that though he could go
anywhere, even to the infernal regions, with his
Lordship, he should be sorry to go to heaven with
Lady Holland.
 </p><p> At the end of the table, occupying the place of the
Master of the house, who is dining alone to-day on
account of the gout, sits Allen. John Allen, a Scotchman, a physician, a writer on constitutional history,
an Edinburgh reviewer, a man of a high character,
warm, kind, and affectionate, and above all, Lady





              <pb id="p.257" n="257"/>

Holland's factotum, the keeper of her conscience, her
very slave. He was a regular inmate of Holland
House. "Allen, like the poor," says <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>, " we
have always with us." His position is not the most
enviable, at least if liberty be a matter of envy. The
imperious Lady Holland constantly ordered him
about. "Mr. Allen, take a candle and show Mr.
Craddock the picture of Buonaparte." During the
dinner on this occasion, Allen happens to say that
some newly-married friend has caught a Tartar. His
mistress is " off into one of her tantrums" at once.
"She a Tartar! Such a charming girl a Tartar!
He is a very happy man, and your language is
insufferable - insufferable, Mr. Allen." Lord Grey,
the Premier, who is one of the party," has all the
trouble in the world to appease her." Allen, in fact,
was ordered about like a footman, and "treated
like a Negro slave." " Mr. Allen, go into my drawingroom, and bring my reticule." "Mr. Allen, go and
see what can be the matter, that they do not bring up
the dinner." " Mr. Allen, there is not enough turtle
soup for you; you must take gravy, or none." The remaining guests to-night are Lord Palmerston, Macau

lay, and Luttrell. <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>, the historian, statesman,
and especial favourite of Lady Holland; he sits at her
right hand, and may be conversing with her on the
English language, on which her Ladyship thinks herself a critic. Luttrell," a famous wit-the most popular
of all professed wits-a man who has lived in the
highest circles; a scholar, and no contemptible poet."
Earl Grey, the Prime Minister; " a proud and majestic
yet polite and affable person."
 </p><p> The dinner passes off with a flow of conversation,
of wit, of brilliancy, and of humour. Yet Lady Holland is not satisfied. The French cook happens to be
ill. "The soup is too salt; the cutlets are not exactly
comme il faut; and the pudding is hardly enough
boiled." Dinner over, Lord Holland is wheeled in, in
his arm chair; he, unlike his wife, is all " kindness,
simplicity, and vivacity, a fine old gentleman, very
gouty and good-natured. He is an open, sensible
man; very lively, very intellectual; well read in
politics and in the lighter literature both of ancient
and modern times." <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> adds, "He sets me
more at ease than almost any person that I know, by
a certain good-humoured way of contradicting that he

               <pb id="p.259" n="259"/>

has. He always begins by drawing down his shaggy
eyebrows, making a face extremely like his uncle
(Charles James Fox), wagging his head, and saying,
'Now, do you know, Mr. <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>, I do not quite see
that. How do you make it out ?"'  On the present
occasion he petitions "most piteously for a slice of
melon, which his wife as steadily refuses," on account
of his gout. Lord Grey intercedes, and is successful.
Lord Holland thanks him, exclaiming, "Ah, Lord
Grey, I wish you were always here; it is a fine thing
to be Prime Minister."
 </p><p> For the materials for the above sketch, we are indebted to one of the guests-<persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>-whose letters
at one period of his life abound with allusion to
<placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, and <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> society. He
was an especial favourite, both of Lord and Lady
Holland.  The latter, indeed, would, so <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>
seems to think, have been glad to "make a second
Allen of him; but for this he was neither qualified nor
inclined." To him she was all courtesy and kindness,
and when he left for India, she became quite hysterical
about his going; cried, raved, and called him dear

 <p> The historian describes his first visit there; he went
in a glass coach, and drove through the fine avenue
of elms, to the great entrance, towards seven o'clock,
in the month of  <date value="1831-05">May,1831</date>. From that time he became a constant visitor, breakfasted there, dined, and
paid Saturday to Monday visits. Here is his mock
dramatical account, tossed off in a familiar letter to
his sister, of a visit to breakfast there:  </p><p><quote rend="blockquote">  Fine Morning-Scene, the great entrance of <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>.

 </p><p> There remain two persons conspicuous in the inner
circle life at <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> as yet unmentioned,Samuel Rogers the poet and banker, and Sidney
Smith the wit.
 </p><p> Rogers was, indeed, the great oracle of the circle,
and has left numerous traces of his presence there.

               <pb id="p.261" n="261"/>

 </p><p> In writing to Lady Holland, Rogers speaks of the
pleasure he anticipates of finding himself " under the
old roof that has sheltered so many foreign statesmen from Sully to Calonne, and so many foreign
artists from Vandyke to Canova."
</p><p>  Whatever we may think of Rogers' poetry, Rogers
himself was a pleasant companion, though "a most
cynical observer of little traits of character."
</p><p>  He and Sidney Smith were two of the most
celebrated conversationalists of the day, and <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> gives us an amusing account of their behaviour
when in society together. "They would not come
into conflict. If one had possession of the company
the other was silent, and as may be conceived the one
who had possession of the company was always
Sidney Smith, and the one who was silent was always
Rogers. Sometimes, however, the company divided,
and each of them had a small congregation."
 </p><p> Sidney Smith, clergyman, wit, and essayist, was
almost as great an habituee of <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> as
Rogers, and many are the good things which he is
recorded to have uttered there.
</p><p>  Sometimes, however, he got the worst of it, and on




<pb id="p.262" n="262"/>
one occasion is said to have been beaten by the
Prince Regent. A discussion taking place, as to who
was the wickedest man that ever lived, Sydney remarked, " The Regent Orleans, and he was a Prince."
"I should give the preference to his tutor, the Abbe
Dubois, and he was a priest, Mr. Sidney," was the
answer. This is certainly surprisingly good for the
first gentleman in Europe.
 </p><p> Sydney usually was a match, and more than a
match for Lady Holland herself. Once she commanded him to ring the bell, "Oh, yes," he retorted,
"and shall I sweep the room?" Other people, however, could sometimes reply as sharply. Her ladyship was accused of occasionally crowding her dinner
table, and on one of these occasions turned to Luttrell,
saying in her imperial decisive manner, "Luttrell,
make room!" "It must certainly be made, for it does
not exist," was his answer. Another time she asked
Lord Alvanly his opinion of some cup made without
claret or champagne, according to a receipt of her
own. "Kensington nettles," was the verdict, a retort
quite in her own style, as the following anecdote
will show. Tom Moore the poet was about to pro
                 <pb id="p.263" n="263"/>

duce a work on Sheridan, the chief merit of which
was to be its vivacity. "This will be a dull book of
yours, this Sheridan, I fear," was her rude and discouraging observation to him at the dinner table one
day.
 </p><p> The mention of Moore reminds us that he also has
considerable claims to be considered a member of the
inner circle.  Moore mentions in one of his letters
that he dined at <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> shortly after the publication of his parody of the Prince's letter, when he was as
yet unknown as its author, and was much flattered and
embarrassed by the praises, the guesses, the curiosity
of the guests concerning the work, none of them being
in the secret except Lord Holland. When "Lalla
Rookh" was published, Lord Holland, always sympathetic, praised the poem very warmly, and "my Lady"
declared that, in spite of her objection to Eastern
things, she must, some time or other, read it herself. Said she also hated Northern subjects, which
Lord Holland remarked was unlucky, as the only
long poem he had ever written was in that region.
Nevertheless, Tom Moore seems to have entertained
a better opinion of Lady Holland than did most of



<pb id="p.264" n="264"/>
her guests. "There are some fine points about Lady
Holland," he writes, "she is a warm and active friend,
and I should think her capable of HIGH MINDEDNESS
upon occasions."
 </p><p> The inner circle list must be closed with the name
of Sir James Mackintosh, a great lawyer and a great
historian, who commenced a History of England, and
one of <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, neither of which, unfortunately,
did he bring to a conclusion. He was a brilliant
conversationalist, full of information, and his historical
writings have perhaps scarcely received the consideration to which they are entitled.
 </p><p> If the inner circle of friends at <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> was
dazzling, the outer circle of acquaintances was not
less brilliant. In those salons almost all the celebrities
of the age were visitors: statesmen, such as Fox,
Grattan, Curran, Windham, Erskine, Lord John Russell, Lord Moira, and Lord Macartney; lawyers,
such as Jeffries, Thurlow, Eldon, Brougham, Lyndhurst, Romilly, and Dumont; poets, represented by
Byron, Moore, Rogers, and Campbell; Sheridan and
Sidney Smith-choice wits of their day; authors
such as Mackintosh, Washington Irving, and Sir

        <pb id="p.265" n="265"/>

Philip Francis; men of science such as Humphrey
Davy and Count Rumford; distinguished foreigners,
as Calonne, Lally Tollendal, Talleyrand, and Madame
de Stael; actors, such as Bannister and Kemble;
playwrights, such as Mark Lewis; medical men, as
Dr. Parr; Georgiana, the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire. The list, in fact, is an almost inexhaustible
one.
 </p><p> But the host, the real keystone of this brilliant
circle, was, as we have seen, an invalid, a martyr to
the gout, and the time was coming when these pleasant
literary reunions were to cease. His illness had indeed been a long and tedious one, and it had been
uncomplainingly borne. Eight years before the end
came, <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> gives us the following sketch of a
Sunday at <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, during which the historian
was engaged in legitimate Sabbath employment, visiting the sick, for my lord was ill, and my ladyship
thought herself so.
 </p><p> "He (Lord Holland) was during the greater part of
the day in bed. For a few hours he lay on his sofa
wrapped in flannels-very weak and languid-and
though the torture of the gout was over, was still in



<pb id="p.266" n="266"/>

pain; but he retained all his courage and all his sweetness of temper."
  </p><p>" I told his sister that I did not think that he was
suffering much. 'I hope not,' said she, 'but it is impossible to judge by what he says, for through the
sharpest pain of the attack he never complains.' I
admire him more, I think, than any man whom I
know. He is only fifty-seven or fifty eight; he is precisely the man to whom health would be particularly
valuable, for he has the keenest zest for those pleasures
which health would enable him to enjoy. He is, however, an invalid and a cripple. He passes some weeks
of every year in extreme torment, and when he is in
the best health he can only limp a hundred yards in
a day; yet he never says a cross word. The sight of
him spreads good humour over the face of every one.
His sister, as excellent an old maid as ever lived and the
favourite of all the young people of her acquaintance,
says that it is quite a pleasure to nurse him. She was
reading" The Inheritance" to him as he lay in bed,
and he enjoyed it amazingly. She is a famous reader,
more eloquent and less theatrical than most famous
readers, and therefore the fittest for the bedside of a
sick man."</p>

               <pb id="p.267" n="267"/>

 <p> This was Miss Fox; "a woman," says one of her
relations in describing her character, "in the best
sense of the word. Such was the dear Aunty! Simplicity and purity of heart were hers; her very contact imparted goodness, her presence sunshine." She
resided at Little <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, "a mansion isolated,
countrified, and standing in a garden," in Nightingale
Lane, which at one time was a public thoroughfare,
but which has been replaced by Holland Lane.
 </p><p> In  <date value="1840-10">October,1840</date>, the end came, and seldom has
any man, not a celebrated statesman, nor a renowned
author, nor a great general, nor a celebrity of any
sort, been so widely lamented in literary circles.
Sidney Smith wrote that it was a great loss, but " I
have learned to live as a soldier does in war, expecting
that on any one moment the best and the dearest may
be killed before his eyes." "The void which Lord
Holland left will never be filled," are the words of
another friend, "a golden link with the genius of the
last age, is broken and gone." <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>'s essay on the
character of Lord Holland is well known-too well
known, for quotation we should have said-had not a
recent writer on <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> borrowed much of its


<pb id="p.268" n="268"/>
matter second hand in apparent ignorance of the
source: </p><p> "The time is coming when, perhaps, a few old men,
the last survivors of our generation will, in vain, seek
amidst new streets and squares and railway stations,
for the site of that dwelling which was in their youth
the favourite resort of wits and beauties, of painters
and poets, of scholars, philosophers and statesmen.
They will remember the venerable and benignant
countenance and the cordial voice of him who bade
them welcome. They will remember that temper,
which years of pain, of sickness, of lameness, of confinement, seemed only to make sweeter and sweeter,
and that frank politeness which at once relieved all the
embarrassment of the youngest and most timid writer
or artist who found himself for the first time among
ambassadors and earls. They will remember that
constant flow of conversation, so natural, so animated,
so various, so rich with observation and anecdote;
that wit which never gave a wound; that exquisite
mimicry which ennobled instead of degraded; that
goodness of heart which appeared in every look and
accent, and gave additional value to every talent and

                  <pb id="p.269" n="269"/>

acquirement. They will remember, too, that he whose
name they hold in reverence was not less distinguished
by the inflexible uprightness of his political conduct
than by his loving disposition and winning manners."
  </p><p>But as <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> wrote in his essays so he wrote in
his private correspondence: "When he died a whole
generation went to the grave with him. While he
lived all the great orators and statesmen of the last
generation were living too. What a store of historical
information he carried away! But his kindness, generosity, and openness of heart, were more valuable than
even his fine accomplishments."
  </p><p>In the wall facing the Kensington High Road there
is a breach filled in with iron palings, which affords a
view of a statue of Lord Holland in the grounds. On
the iron work, above a fountain are inscribed the
following verses:
         <quote rend="blockquote">   "Nephew of Fox and friend of Grey!
               <lb/>Be this my meed of fame,
               <lb/>That those who know me best may say
               <lb/>He tarnished neither name."</quote>

  </p><p>These, says <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>, were the last lines he traced,
and his friends will "have reason to feel similar joy



<pb id="p.270" n="270"/>
if, in looking back on many troubled years, they
cannot accuse themselves of having done anything
unworthy of men who were distinguished by the
friendship of Lord Holland."</p>

</p><p>On the death of the third Lord, his son Henry Edward,
who was for some time British Minister at Florence,
succeeded him. He died at Naples in <date value="1859">1859</date>, and the
house is now in the possession of his widow, Lady
Holland, who has sold the reversion of it to the Earl
of Ilchester. We have now nothing to do but to take
our leave of this house " which can boast of a greater
number of inmates distinguished more in political and
literary history than any other private dwelling in
England "-an observation of <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>'s, capped by
that of Lord Brougham, that "it was the resort not
only of the most interesting persons composing English society, literary, philosophical, and political, but
also of all belonging to those classes who ever visited
this country from abroad."</p>


<pb id="p.272" n="272"/>
 <p> No wonder we quit such a spot lingeringly, and,
indeed, as we walk through the grounds there is much
to make us linger. To reach them we may pass through
the door, out of the large bow window in the West
Room, just glancing at a view of " Ranelagh," and
another of "Private Theatricals,"      by  Hogarth.     On
descending a flight of steps, we shall find ourselves in
the Dutch garden; walking in zigzag we come across
a green-bowered summer-house, on either side of
which is a fox cut in box. This is " Rogers' seat,"
where Lord Holland placed the inscription,
     <quote rend="blockquote"> " Here Rogers sat, and here for ever dwell
        <lb/>With me, those Pleasures that he sings so well."
        <lb/>                            -" VII. Hd. <date value="1818">1818</date>."</quote>

  </p><p> Hanging below, there is this commentary by our
old friend, Luttrell, the wit:     <quote rend="blockquote"> "How happily sheltered is he who reposes
        <lb/>In this haunt of the poet, overshadowed with roses,
        <lb/>While the sun is rejoicing unclouded on high,
        <lb/>And summer's full majesty reigns in the sky !
        <lb/>Let me in, and be seated. I'll try if, thus placed,
        <lb/>I can catch but one spark of his feeling and taste,
        <lb/>Can steal a sweet note from his musical strain,
        <lb/>Or a ray of his genius to kindle my brain.
        <lb/>Well now I am fairly installed in the bower,
        <lb/>How lovely the scene ! How propitious the hour !
        <lb/>The breeze is perfumed by the hawthorn it stirs;
        <lb/>All is beauty around me-but nothing occurs;

                <pb id="p.273" n="273"/>

       <lb/>Not a thought, I protest-Tho' I'm here, and alone,
       <lb/>Not a line can I hit on that Rogers would own,
       <lb/>Though my senses are ravished, my feelings in tune,
       <lb/>And Holland's my host, and the season is June.
       <lb/>The trial is ended, no garden, nor grove,
       <lb/>Though poets amid them may linger or rove,
       <lb/>Not a seat e'en so hallowed as this can impart
       <lb/>The fancy and fire that must spring from the heart.
       <lb/>So I rise, since the Muses continue to frown,
       <lb/>No more of a poet than when I sat down;
       <lb/>While Rogers, on whom they look kindly, can strike
       <lb/>Their lyre at all times, in all places, alike.
  <lb/><date value="1818-06">June,1818</date>.                          HENRY LUTTRELL."</quote>
 </p><p><persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName> thought these lines very pretty and
polished.
</p><p>  Opposite the summer-house is a bronze bust of
Napoleon I., with a Greek inscription from the
Odyssey    on  the  pedestal.    We    have   innumerable
English versions of the lines, many made by visitors
to the House, and here is <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington">Macaulay</persName>'s, which he
thought gave in a measure, a better idea of Homer's
manner than " Pope's sing-song couplet" :
         <quote rend="blockquote">   "For not, be sure, within the grave
              <lb/>Is hid that prince, the wise, the brave;
              <lb/>But in an islet's narrow bound,
              <lb/>With the great ocean roaring round
              <lb/>The captive of a foeman base
              <lb/>He pines to view his native place."</quote>
 </p><p> Passing through the arcade at the end of the gar


<pb id="p.274" n="274"/>
den, we find ourselves in the second part of the Dutch
garden, largely given to the cultivation of the Dahlia
of which the third Lady Holland may claim to have
been the first successful importer, an event which her
husband commemorated in the following lines:        <quote rend="blockquote">  "The Dahlia you brought to our isle,
            <lb/>Your praises for ever shall speak,
            <lb/>'Mid gardens as sweet as your smile,
            <lb/>And in colours as bright as your cheek."
</quote>
  </p><p>Lord Holland must have been of a wonderfully
forgiving nature.
 </p><p> We must not forget to pay a visit to the moats, said
to be the site of the old Manor House of the De
Veres, and the scene of the Best and Camelford duel.
</p><p>  Lord Camelford was a nephew ot the great Earl of
Chatham, a young man of an extravagantly " wild"
disposition, with considerable talents, and a fondness
for literature, science, and seamanship, but with a
character altogether unformed and eccentric.  The
quarrel with Mr. Best was about a lady. His lordship
paid Mr. Best a visit at his hotel in Bond Street, and
said to him with perfect calmness, "Mr. Best, I am
glad to see you face to face, and to tell you, you are
an infamous scoundrel."

           <pb id="p.275" n="275"/>

  </p><p>Lord Camelford at heart owned himself entirely in the
wrong, and on the night before the duel inserted in his
will a paper on which he had written, " In the present
contest, I am fully and entirely the aggressor, as well as
in the spirit, as in the letter of the word; should I lose
my life in a contest of my own seeking, I must
solemnly forbid any of my friends or relations, let
them be of whatsoever description they may, from
instituting any vexatious proceedings against my
antagonist."
 </p><p> Unfortunately, he had not the moral courage to
acknowledge this to his opponent, lest he might be
accused of cowardice, Mr. Best having the reputation
of being a good shot. The encounter took place at
eight o'clock on the morning of the  <date value="1804-10-07">7th October,1804</date>.
Lord Camelford fired first, and missed. Then Mr.
Best fired, and his antagonist fell. He was at once
removed to Little <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, then occupied by
Mr. Ottic, and after having suffered much pain, died
on the evening of Saturday, a victim to his own want
of moral determination and the most barbarous
custom which human stupidity has countenanced in
modern times. The day before he died he wrote a




<pb id="p.276" n="276"/>

codicil to his will. "I wish," said he, " my body to be
removed as soon as may be convenient to a country
far distant-to a spot not near the haunts of menbut where the surrounding scenery may smile upon
my remains. It is situated on the borders of the
Lake of St. Lampierre, in the canton of Berne, and
three trees stand in the particular spot." The centre
tree, he adds, is to be taken up, his body deposited,
and the tree immediately replaced. " Let no monument, or stone, be placed over my grave." He left a
sum of money to satisfy the proprietors of the spot
chosen. He desired that no mourning should be
worn for him. There was considerable confusion in
carrying out his wishes, and ultimately, it appears,
they were neglected, and the body placed in the vaults
of St. Anne's Church, Soho. "The spot where the
duel was fought," says the Princess Marie Lichtenstein, "a few years ago was the scene of merry parties,
where the Duc and Duchesse d'Aumale used to fish
with the late Lord Holland."  Here Lord Holland
placed an ancient Roman expiatory altar, with a
classical inscription to the Dii Manes. The altar has
since been removed.

                <pb id="p.277" n="277"/>

 </p><p> Let us also notice the two pieces of Portland stone
designed by Inigo Jones, on the south, and the lawn
or meadow in front of the house, concerning which
exists the tradition that Ireton and Cromwell conferred there to be out of the reach of eavesdroppers.
Our <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> visit has indeed been a long
one, yet we might have remained twice the time,
and yet have far from exhausted its treasures. Still,
our ramble has worn out the day, evening is closing
in, darkness is coming on, and <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> boasts
of two ghosts. One, indeed-that of the First Lord
-confines himself to the Gilt Room, and need give
us no anxiety, but there is another-and an outdoor
one-who was seen by his daughter Lady Diana
Rich in broad daylight. She met her double, habit
and everything as in a looking glass. Her sister also
saw " the like of herself before she died." Lest, then,
so hideous a spectacle should appal our eyes, let us
hasten down the avenue of elms, happy if we conclude our moonlight ramble as gunfire sounds from
the House, the clock striking eleven. The origin
of this gunfire seems uncertain; some say it comes
from Spain, others that it is to show that the servants




<pb id="p.278" n="278"/>
are properly armed against thieves. But, whatever may
be its origin, it warns us to pass through the large
iron gates ornamented with the hand and coronet,
and, in Lord Carlisle's words, to bid adieu to

              <quote rend="blockquote">     The pile to Addison so dear,
         <lb/>Where Sully feasted, and where Rogers' song
         <lb/>Still adds sweet music to the perfum'd air,
         <lb/>And gently leads each grace and muse along ;"
</quote>
or we may then heartily re-echo the wish which
Hookham    Frere cut on the window        of a   room   in
the East Turret:
      <quote rend="blockquote"> "May neither fire destroy, nor waste impair,
         <lb/>Nor time consume thee, till the twentieth Heir.
         <lb/>May Taste respect thee, and may Fashion spare."</quote>

on which Rogers remarked, <q type="?"> I wonder where he got
the diamond ?</q></p>
