<p>FROM the time of Dean <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> downwards to our own
days, many Political Histories of the Reign of Queen
Anne have been written, but its Social Life we have
been left to gather mainly from the efforts of novelists,
who have been more or less conscientious, according
to their knowledge, in placing it before us.</p>
   <p> No doubt the drudgery of the work, the wading
through all the newspapers, and reading all the
literature of the time, has deterred many from attempting
what, in its execution, has proved a very pleasant
task; for in doing it, one has got to be thoroughly
identified with the age-its habits and
customswhich, being taken from the very words of the people
then living, writing for living people, who could
contradict their statements, if false or exaggerated, a
charm was lent to the task, which fully compensated
for its labour.</p>
   <p> All history, unless it is contemporary, must
necessarily, if honest, be a compilation, and my idea is,
that it should honestly be avowed as such, and the
authorities given for all facts; and this I have done,
even at the risk of proving wearisome.</p>
<pb n="vi" id="p.vi"/>

    <p>In compiling it, my task has been similar to one
 who, having a necklace of old beads, finds it broken,
 and the beads scattered hither and thither.  His
 business, naturally, is to gather them together, and
 string them so as to satisfy criticism. He may not
 pick them all up, and he may not please everyone's
 taste in his arrangement, but his course is
clearhe should not add new beads of his own to supply
 deficiencies, but should confine himself to putting
 together all he can find in the best manner he
possibly can.</p>
   <p>The almost total absence of domestic news in
the newspapers has compelled me to draw largely on
the essays and descriptive books of the time, and in
one or two instances I have ventured to transcribe
(as in the case of Misson) from works published, or
written, two or three years before Anne actually
reigned-but the facts were precisely the same as
then obtained, so that much has been gained thereby.</p>
   <p>The Illustrations might, undoubtedly, have been
made more artistic and unreal-but I have carefully
taken them from contemporary prints, and prefer to
present them in all their uncouthness and reality.

<p>IN all climes, and in all ages, since Man's creation, he has
been subject to the same conditions, modified only by
circumstances. He has been born-has had to receive some
education (if only taught to fish and hunt for his subsistence),
which was to fit him for the position he was to occupy in this
life. This was absolutely necessary, for it is scarcely possible
to imagine a more helpless being than an infant. In most
cases he married, and so helped to preserve his species, and
most certainly he died.</p>
   <p>The scheme of existence in Queen <persName key="Anne (1665-1714)">Anne</persName>'s time was no
exception to the normal state of things-only, as the ways
of people then, were not exactly similar to ours, it will
be interesting to note the differences attending childhood,


<pb n="2" id="p.2"/>
education, marriage, and death. The Queen herself had more
than once been a mother;<note n="1" place="foot">Seventeen times, in fact.</note>  but only one child,
the <persName key="William, Duke of Gloucester(1689-1700)">Duke of Gloucester</persName>, lived any length of time, and in his infancy he
was indebted for his life to a young Quakeress, who acted as
his wet nurse. Poor little fellow! his brief stay on earth was
not a pleasant one. He suffered from hydrocephalus (water
on the brain), and his head was so big that at five years of age
his hat was large enough for an ordinary man. He could
hardly toddle about, and felt himself unable to go up stairs
without being led. His father and mother seemed to think
that this assistance was not necessary; and, shutting
themselves in a room with the poor little boy, Prince George gave
him such a severe thrashing with a birch rod, that sheer pain
made him move, and from that time he managed to get up
and down stairs without help. Coddled by the women, and
with somewhat rough playmates of his own sex, he amused
himself by drilling his company of boy soldiers, even
reviewing them on his eleventh birthday, the day before he
sickened with scarlet fever, of which he speedily died. His
mother grieved sorely for him, but never had another child to
supply his place.</p>
   <p>On her accession to the throne, the succession (failing her
issue) was unsettled, and most anxious was the whole nation
that she should yet be the mother of their future sovereign.
In  'The form of prayer with thanksgiving to Almighty God
to be used in all churches and chapels within this realm, every
year upon the eighth day of March (being the day upon
which Her Majesty began her happy reign),'  in the prayer at
the Communion service, immediately before the reading of
the epistle, ' for the Queen as supreme Governor of this
Church,'  was the following petition:  'And that these
Blessings may be continued to after Ages, make the Queen, we
pray thee, an happy Mother of Children, who being Educated
in Thy true Faith and Fear may happily succeed Her in the
Government of these Kingdoms.'  Her husband, Prince George,
died <date value="1708-10-28">October 28, 1708</date>; and it was not until January 13 of
the next year, that the Council struck out this portion of the
service, some one evidently remembering that the 8th of March

<pb n="3" id="p.3"/>

was approaching. On January 28, <date value="1709">1709</date>, both Houses of
Parliament petitioned Her Majesty to marry again ; but her
wounds were too recent and too sore. She replied that the
provision she had made for the Protestant succession would
always be a proof of her hearty concern for the happiness
of the nation; but that the subject of their address was of
such a nature that she was persuaded they did not expect a
particular answer. <note place="foot" n="1"> <title>The Chronological Historian</title>, &amp;c., by W. Toone, ed. <date value="1826">1826</date>.</note></p>
    <p>Ignorantly as the little <persName key="William,Duke of Gloucester (1689-1700)">Duke of Gloucester</persName> was treated,
what was the condition of ordinary babies? Let a
contemporary tell the tale. <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>,
<note place="foot" n="2"><hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, No. 15.</note> writing as if his familiar Pacolet
was speaking, and giving an experience of his sensations,
says:  'The first thing that ever struck my senses was a
noise over my head of one shrieking ; after which, methought
I took a full jump, and found myself in the hands of a
sorceress, who seemed as if she had been long waking, and
employed in some incantation. I was thoroughly frightened,
and cried out; but she immediately seemed to go on in some
magical operation, and anointed me from head to foot.
What they meant I could not imagine: for there gathered a
great crowd about me, crying, "An heir! an heir! " upon
which I grew a little still, and believed this was a ceremony
only to be used to great persons, and such as made them
what they called heirs.
   I lay very quiet, but the witch, for no manner of reason
or provocation in the world, takes me, and binds my head as
hard as possibly she could; then ties up both my legs, and
makes me swallow down an horrid mixture. I thought it an
harsh entrance into life, to begin with taking physic; but I
was forced to it, or else must have taken down a great
instrument in which she gave it to me. When I was thus dressed, I
was carried to a bedside, where a fine young lady (my mother,
I wot) had liked to have hugged me to death. From her
they faced me about, and there was a thing with quite another
look from the rest of the company, to whom they talked
about my nose. He seemed wonderfully pleased to see me;
but I know since, my nose belonged to another family.



<pb n="4" id="p.4"/>

   That into which I was born is one of the most numerous
among you; therefore crowds of relations came every day
to congratulate my arrival; amongst others, my cousin Betty,
the greatest romp in nature; she whisks me such a height
over her head, that I cried out for fear of falling. She pinched
me and called me squealing chit, and threw me into a girl's
arms that was taken in to tend me. The girl was very proud
of the womanly employment of a nurse, and took upon her
to strip and dress me anew, because I made a noise, to see
what ailed me; she did so, and stuck a pin in every joint
about me. I still cried; upon which she lays me on my face in
her lap; and to quiet me, fell to a-nailing in all the pins, by
clapping me on the back, and screaming a lullaby. But my
pain made me exalt my voice above hers, which brought up
the nurse, the witch I first saw, and my grandmother. The
girl is turned downstairs, and I stripped again, as well to find
what ailed me as to satisfy my granam's farther curiosity. This
good woman's visit was the cause of all my troubles. You
are to understand that I was hitherto bred by hand, and
anybody that stood next me gave me pap if I did but open
my lips; insomuch, that I was grown so cunning as to
pretend myself asleep when I was not, to prevent my being
crammed.
   But my grandmother began a loud lecture upon the
idleness of this age, who, for fear of their shapes, forbear suckling
their own offspring; and ten nurses were immediately sent
for; one was whispered to have a wanton eye, and would
soon spoil her milk; another was in a consumption; the
third had an ill voice, and would frighten me instead of
lulling me to sleep. Such exceptions were made against all
but one country milch-wench, to whom I was committed and
put to the breast. This careless jade was perpetually
romping with the footman, and downright starved me; insomuch
that I daily pined away, and should never have been relieved
had it not been that on the thirtieth day of my life a Fellow
of the <orgName key="Royal Society">Royal Society</orgName>, <note place="foot" n="3">Probably Sir John Floyer, who wrote several books on the wonderful cures
made by cold water bathing</note>. who had writ upon " Cold Baths," came
to visit me, and solemnly protested I was utterly lost for want

<pb n="5" id="p.5"/>

of that method; upon which he soused me head and ears into
a pail of water, where I had the good fortune to be drowned.' </p>
   <p>After its birth the babe was soon baptized, but there does
not seem to have been a great social fuss made about the
event. That most entertaining and observant traveller
<persName key="Misson,Henri">Henri Misson</persName>, who visited England at the very close of the
seventeenth century, and whose book was translated into English
in <date value="1719">1719</date>, <note place="foot" n="4"><persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Memoirs and Observations in his Travels over England</hi>, &amp;c.,
translated by Ozells, <date value="1719">1719</date>.</note>
 says,  ' The custom here is not to make great feasts
at the birth of their children. They drink a glass of wine
and eat a bit of a certain cake, which is seldom made but
upon these occasions.' </p>
   <p><persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName>, <note place="foot" n="5"> The <hi rend="italics">London Spy</hi>, ed. <date value="1703">1703</date>.</note> however, has left us a humorous description of a
private christening. He was asked by a relation to stand
Godfather to his newborn Child, and  'I, wanting ill-Nature
enough to resist his Importunities, submitted to his Requests;
and engag'd for once to stand as a Tom Doodle for an hour
or two, to be banter'd by a Tittle-Tattle Assembly of Female
Gossips. The time appointed for the Solemnisation of this
Ancient piece of Formality being come, after I had put on a
clean Band, and bestow'd Two Penniworth of Razorridge on
the most Fertile part of my Face, whose Septuary Crop
requir'd Mowing, away I Trotted towards the Joyful Habitation
of my Friend and Kinsman, but with as aking a Heart as a
Wise Man goes to be Married, or a Broken Merchant comes
near the Counter. . . . As soon as we came into the Room, and
had bow'd our Backs to the old Cluster of Harridans, and
they in return had bent their knees to us, I sneak'd up to the
Parson's Elbow, and my Partner after me . . . whilst Old
Mother Grope stood rocking of the Bantling in her Arms,
wrap'd up in so Rich a Mantle as if both Indias had club'd
their utmost Riches to furnish out a Noble covering for my
little Kinsman, who came as callow into the world as a Bird
out of an Eggshell.</p>
   <p>At last the Babe was put into my hands to deliver, tho'
not as my Act and Deed, to the Parson, who having
consecrated some New River water for his purpose, wash'd away


<pb n="6" id="p.6"/>



Original Sin from my new Nephew, and brought him amongst
us Christians into a state of Salvation. But when my froward
Godson felt the Cold Water in his face, he threaten'd the Priest
with such a parcel of Angry Looks, that if he had been strong
enough I dare swear he would have serv'd him the same
Sauce, and under the same Ignorance would have return'd
him but little thanks for his Labour. After we had joined
together in a Petition for the good of the infant Christian,
the Religious part was concluded. . . . As soon as the Parson
had refreshed his Spirits with a bumper of Canary, dedicated
to the Mother; and the Clerk had said Amen to his Master's
good Wishes, after the like manner, each of 'em accepted of a
Paper of Sweetmeats for his Wife or his Children, and away
they went, leaving the Company behind.'  They then seem
to have drunk a full quantity of wine, and the women having
eaten, drank, and gossiped sufficiently, were each presented
with  'a Service of Sweetmeats, which every Gossip carried
away in her Handkerchief. . . . Having now struggled
through every difficult part of these Accustomary Formalities,
I had nothing to do but to Thank them for our Liberal
Entertainment, Wish the Women well again, and both much
Happiness in their Male Offspring, and so take my Leave, which
I did accordingly; and was as greatly overjoyed when I got
out of the House as ever Convict was that had broke Gaol or
Detected Pick Pocket that had Escaped a Horse Pond.' </p>
   <p>Having launched our baby thus far in life, we will see
how he was treated when suffering from any of the numerous
ailments which infancy is subject to. The marvel is that so
many grew up. It was eminently  'the survival of the fittest.'
Sanitary arrangements were extremely rudimentary; little
care being taken either as to the purity of the water supply,
or the efficiency of drainage. Fever was always in their
midst, and, neither inoculation nor vaccination being known,
or practised, smallpox was rampant, and spared no class, from
the <persName key="Mary II">Queen (Mary)</persName> to the beggar. Was the child fretful, there
was that cordial dear to old nurses of the Gamp school-
Daffy's Elixir. This remedy, which has survived as a popular
nostrum to our own time, was not new in <persName key="Anne (1665-1714)">Queen Anne</persName>'s
reign. It must then ever have been a profitable property, for
<pb n="7" id="p.7"/>

rivals could afford to quarrel over it, as the following
advertisements show:-

        '<hi rend="cl">DAFFY'S FAMOUS ELIXIR SALUTIS,<note place="foot" n="6"><hi rend="italics">Harl.</hi> 593I, 226.</note>
            PREPARED BY KATHARINE DAFFY.</hi>
The Finest now expos'd to Sale, prepar'd from the best
Druggs, according to Art, and the Original Receipt, which
my Father Mr. Thomas Daffy, late Rector of Redmile, in
the Valley of Belvoir, having experienc'd the Virtue of it,
imparted to his Kinsman Mr. Anthony Daffy, who publish'd
the same to the Benefit of the Community, and his own
great Advantage. This Very Original Receipt is now in my
possession, left to me by my Father aforesaid, under his own
Hand. My own Brother Mr. Daniel Daffy, formerly
Apothecary in Nottingham, made this ELIXIR from the same
Receipt, and Sold it there during his Life. Those who know
me will believe what I Declare; and those who donot may
be convinc'd that I am no counterfeit, by the Colour, Tast,
Smell, and just Operation of my ELIXIR. To be had at
the Hand and' Pen in Maiden Lane, <placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName>, London;
and many other Places in Town and Country.' </p>
   <p><hi rend="la">Prima facie</hi>, the lady would seem to have made out her
case; but there were other aspirants to fame-as the following
notice <note place="foot" n="7"><hi rend="italics">Ibid.</hi> 121.</note> will show :-
                    '<hi rend="cl">ADVERTISEMENT.</hi>
   Forasmuch as Mrs. Elizabeth Daffy has lately Published
an Advertisement containing Invidious Reflections upon me,
in relation to my Elixir Salutis, I should be wanting to my
Self if I should not obviate them in the like public manner, to
let the World see they are Malicious, unreasonable, and false.
   In the first place she charges me with Clandestinely taking
the House in Prugeon's Court; which, by her leave, is equally
absurd and unjust; for the House was to be Lett a long time
before I took it (nor had she any lease of the House, or any
Power to Lett it), so consequently any one else might have
taken the same. As for my pretending to have been her
Husband's Assistant in preparing the Elixir, I will only say




<pb n="8" id="p.8"/>
this is just as true as the former Story; and I challenge her to
produce one single Evidence of Refutation to prove her
Assertion: nor had I need of any such trifling pretence, having
known the Secret some time before the Death of his Father
Dr. Anthony Daffy; which I presume was before the said
Elias Daffy was privy to the preparing of the said Elixir (he
being then a <placeName key="Cambridge">Cambridge</placeName> scholar), and the same was
communicated to me in the year <date value="1684">1684</date>, at the time I was going to
travel beyond Sea, where, in divers Countries, considerable
Quantities of my Elixir has been taken by Persons of the
greatest Rank, Quality, and Note, to their great Satisfaction.</p>
   <p>And whereas the said Mrs. Daffy is pleased to call my
Elixir Spurious, and Insinuates as if it were hazardous to the
Lives of Men; the numerous Instances of Good it has done,
both here and abroad, do manifestly evince the Contrary. And
I appeal to all who have taken it in this City, or elsewhere,
whether they have not found at least as much Benefit from
This as from any Thing of the like Nature they have ever
taken; insomuch that I am well assured that those who have
tried mine will apply themselves to nobody else for Elixir
Salutis.                             <hi rend="cl">JOHN HARRISON</hi>.</p>

   <p>One doctor at least, (John Pechy) made the diseases of
infants and children his study, and wrote upon the subject.
I have been unable to get his book, but a few remedies from
the medical works then in vogue will show how these diseases
were then treated. Here is a recipe for a child's cough.<note place="foot" n="8">

<p><figure id="fig.2" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00002"><head>THE NURSERY.</head></figure></p>

    <p>Of the Nursery we know very little; indeed children are
 very seldom mentioned. It is most likely that, in well-to-do
 families, they were relegated to the nursery, and the care of
<pb n="11" id="p.11"/>

their mothers, until they were of fit age to go to school. The
accompanying illustration, taken from  'The Ladies' Library,'
ed. <date value="1714">1714</date>, by <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>, gives us an excellent view of the
nursery.</p>
   <p>The very babies were amused much as now-for <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName>,
<hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> No. 1, speaking of his natural gravity, says,  'I
threw away my rattle before I was two Months old, and
would not make use of my Coral till they had taken away
all the Bells from it.'  Some of these corals were very
beautiful and costly, even being made of gold.</p>
   <p>We know how, from the earliest ages, a doll has been the
favourite toy with girls, and the reign of  '<hi rend="italics">Good Queen Anne</hi>'
was no exception to the general rule <figure id="fig.3" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00003"><head>'TROOPE, EVERY ONE'</head></figure>
-but they were not then called Dolls,
but  'Babies' ; so, indeed, were Powel's
Marionettes--as also the milliner's
models.  'On Saturday last, being the
12th instant, there arrived at my
House in <placeName key="King Street">King Street</placeName>, <placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName>,
a French Baby for the year <date value="1712">1712</date>,'  &amp;c.
Some were made of wax, but these
were, of course, of the expensive sort,
as must also have been those in
Widow Smith's raffle- '  large joynted
dressed Babies.'  Probably, dolls were
the girls' only playthings.  As to
the boys, history records very little
of their amusements. Give a boy in
the nursery a whip, or a stick, to beat
somebody, or something, he generally
is content. How superlatively happy, however, must he have
been in the possession of one of these wonderful horses
?warranted chargers-troop horses, every one! They also
had card-board windmills on the end of sticks. We hear
nothing of marbles, tops, or any other toys; but, doubtless,
children's ingenuity supplied any defects that way, then as
now, and made shift to play, and amuse themselves, until
the time of enfranchisement came, and the boy could wander
in the streets and see the marvels of the raree show, and

<pb n="12" id="p.12"/>
buy  'hot baked wardens-hot,'  or some of old  'Colly Molly
Puffe's'  pastry-or, should his tastes be simpler, there were
 'Ripe Strawberries,'  or  'Sixpence a pound fair Cherryes.' </p>
   <p>These little folk, however, had their special literature.
For there was compiled and printed  'A Play book for
Children, to allure them to read as soon as they can speak plain;
composed of small Pages so as not to tire children; printed
with a fair and pleasing Letter, the Matter and Method plainer
and easier than any yet extant.'  The price of this was
fourpence, and it must have been a favourite, for it is advertised
as being in its second edition in
<date value="1703">1703</date>. Certainly, the little ones
then, lacked many advantages in
this way that ours possess- but,
on the other hand, so much was
<figure id="fig.4" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00004"><head>RAREE SHOW</head></figure>
not required of them. There was no dreaded  'Exam.'  to
prepare for-no doing lessons all day long, and then working
hard at night to get ready for the next day's toil. They
were not taught half a dozen languages, and all the
ologies, whilst still in the nursery; but, were the suggestions
and advice given to  'the Mother'  in <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>'s  'Lady's
Library'  thoroughly carried out, they would grow up good
men and women.</p>
   <p>The boys, however, had strong meat provided for them in
such tales as  'Jack and the Giants,'  &amp;c. <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>, in <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>

95, says, speaking of a little boy of eight years old,  'I
perceived him a very great historian in  " AEsop's Fables,"  but
he frankly declared to me his mind > "that he did not delight
in that learning, because he did not believe they were true,"
for which reason I found he had very much turned his studies
for about a twelvemonth past unto the lives and adventures
of Don Bellianis of Greece, Guy of Warwick, the Seven
Champions, and other historians of that age ... He would
tell you the mismanagements of John Hickerthrift, find fault

with the passionate temper in Bevis of Southampton, and
loved Saint George for being the champion of England....
I was extolling his accomplishments, when his mother told
me that the little girl who led me in this morning was in
her way a better scholar than he.  " Betty,"  says she,  "deals
chiefly in Fairies and Sprights; and sometimes in a winter
night will terrify the maids with her accounts, until they are
afraid to go up to bed." ' </p>
   <p>In all probability the child learned his letters in the

<pb n="14" id="p.14"/>

first instance from a  ' Hornbook,'  such as were then
commonly used and sold-as the following excerpt from an
advertisement shows:  'Joseph Hazard at the Bible, in
Stationers Court, near <placeName key="Ludgate">Ludgate</placeName>, sells .. . Spelling books,
Primers, Hornbooks, &amp;c.'  Hornbooks are now very scarce
indeed, and the man lucky enough to possess a genuine one
must feel proud of his rarity. It consisted of a small sheet
of paper, generally about 4 in. x 3 in. or so-sometimes
smaller-on which was printed the alphabet, both in capitals
and small text, the vowels, and a few simple combinations,
such as ab, eb, ib, ob, ab,-ba, be, bi, bo, bu, &amp;c., and the
Lord's Prayer. This was laid on a flat piece of board with a
roughly shaped handle, and covered with a thin plate of horn,
fastened to the board by copper tacks driven through an
edging of thin copper. It therefore would stand a vast
amount of rough usage before it would be destroyed-a fact
of great importance in elementary education.</p>
   <p>Private tuition existed then as now.  'A Grave
Gentlewoman of about 50 years of age desires to be Governess to
any Gentleman's Children; she can give a very good account
of herself,'  and  'Whereas in this degenerate Age Youth are
kept for so many Years in following the Latin Tongue, and
many of them are quite discourag'd, Mr. Switterda (who
was formerly recommended to the late King William, and
well known by their Excellences my Lord Sparkein and my
Lord Methuen) offers a very easy and delightful Method, by
which any Person of tolerable Capacity, who can but spare
time to be twice a Week with him, and an Hour at a Time,
nay, Children of ten Years of Age, may in one Year learn
to speak Latin and French fluently, according to the Grammar
rules, and to understand a Classical Author; and if they are
not compleat in that time, he will teach them without any
farther Charge, provided they will be manag'd.'  Another
gentleman, living in Abchurch Lane, offered to do the same,
and, moreover,  'he offereth to be bound to every one for the
performance thereof, and to give a Month's trial.' </p>
   <p>But a Day School was the normal institution for a boy,
although there were Boarding Schools. Judging by the
advertisements, these must have been but few in the

<pb n="15" id="p.15"/>

beginning of the reign, as they gradually become more
numerous towards its close. A record of one or two will
suffice to show what kind of education they gave.  ' At the
upper end of Knights Bridge, near the Salutation, there is a
Boarding School for young Gentlemen, where, besides French,
are carefully taught, after the best English method, Latin,
Greek, Writing, Arithmetic, Geography, &amp;c.'  And again, ' At
Lady Day next will be open'd a Boarding School for young
Gentlemen at <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> Gravel Pits, by Richard Johnson,
A.M., author of the Grammatical Commentaries .... There
will be taught also French, Writing, Arithmetick, and
Mathematicks;'  whilst another takes a wider range:  'A boarding
School will be open'd after Easter, at Chertsey ... for the
Instruction of Youth in the English, French, Latin, Greek,
and Hebrew Tongues, besides Geography, History,
Mathematicks, Writing, and Accompts; to fit 'em either for the
University, Study of the Law, or other Business.' </p>
   <p>In London, too, were many free schools. There were
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, Merchant Taylors', Paul's, Greyfriars, Christ's
Hospital, and St. Olave's, Southwark. There were three free
schools in <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> besides the Queen's School; these
were, Palmer's in Tuttlefields, Almery School, and Hill's
School. Besides which were Lady Owen's School, Islington,
and Bunhill School-and there were free schools in
Cherrytree Alley, Castle Street (Tennyson's), Great Queen Street,
Parker's Lane, Church Entry, Old Jewry, Whitechapel,
Ratcliffe, Foster Lane, Hoxton, St. Saviour's, Southwark,
Plough Yard, Rotherhithe, and <placeName key="East Smithfield">East Smithfield</placeName>-and this
probably is not an exhaustive list.</p>
   <p>Although French, High Dutch, and Italian were taught,
it was a Classical age, and every gentleman was bound to
be a fair, if not a good, classical scholar; indeed, other
branches of education were neglected for this, as <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>
complains (<hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 147) that boys at school,  'When they
are got into Latin, they are looked upon as above English,
the reading of which is wholly neglected, or at least read
to very little purpose.'  We might look a long time
nowa-days for an advertisement such as the following:  'At
Hogarth's Coffee House in<placeName key=" St. John's Gate"> St. John's Gate</placeName>, the mid-way
<pb n="16" id="p.16"/>
between <placeName key="Smithfield">Smithfield</placeName> Bars and Clerkenwel, there will meet every
day at 4 o'clock some Learned Gentlemen who speak Latin
readily, where any Gentleman that is either skilled in that
Language, or desirous to perfect himself in speaking thereof,
will be welcome. The Master of the House, in the absence
of others, being always ready to entertain gentlemen in the
Latin Tongue.'  It is much to be doubted if that literary
society, the Urban Club, which till lately held its meetings
at the same place,<placeName key=" St. John's Gate"> St. John's Gate</placeName>, could do the same.</p>
   <p>Let us glance at a few of the school books then in vogue.
First of all is one of the immortal Cocker,  'according to'  whom,
all correct calculations should be made. Although he had been
long dead (since <date value="1677">1677</date>), his works lived after him ; and there
were also other works on Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry,
and the use of the Globes. (By the way, a pair of 9-in. diam.
globes only cost a guinea.) There were Latin Dictionaries,
Lilly's Latin Grammar, and an abridgment of it for the use
of Blackheath School. There was that English Grammar
which  'Isaac Bickerstaff'  (<persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>) puffed up so: 'That as
grammar in general is on all hands allow'd the
foundation of all arts and sciences, so it appears to me that this
grammar of the English tongue has done that justice to our
language which,  'till now, it never obtained ;'  and there was  ' A
Guide to the English Tongue, by Thos. Dyche, schoolmaster
in London,'  the second edition of which was published in 171O,
but which has been so popular that a revised edition of it was
published as late as <date value="1816">1816</date>; and there were any quantity of
books on writing-notably the  ' Paul's Scholar's Copy Book,
by John Rayner,'  immortalised in <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi> 138. The writing
of the age was very good-and many are the specimens of
elaborate caligraphy in the  ' Bagford Collection' : for
unassuming and yet good writing, perhaps, however, the best are in
Harl. MS. 5995, 211,<note place="foot" n="13"><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">Harl.</hi> MSS</hi>., British Museum.</note> &amp;c. In the eighteenth century
penmanship was held in higher estimation than now, and in <date value="1763">1763</date> W.
Massey published  'The Origin and Progress of Letters,'  in
which he gave the lives of the most famous writing masters
during the preceding hundred years. He mentions some half-dozen


<pb n="17" id="p.17"/>
 or more, as living in Anne's reign, but Charles Snell
  seems to have been the most famous.</p>
     <p>As may be supposed, when so much pains was taken in
  writing, there were many curiosities of caligraphic art. Here
  is one:  'A piece of close Knotting, viz. 2 Boys holding
  Circles in their Hands, either being less than a Silver Penny,
  in which are perspicuously wrote the Lords Prayer in Latin
  and English. Invented and perform'd by John Dundas (who
  will shortly publish a Copy book with about 50 new Fancies).
  . . . N.B. Any Gentleman or Lady that desires small Writing
  for a Ring, Locket, or other Curiosity, may be furnished by'
  the Author.' </p>
     <p>That pens other than quill were in use is evidenced by
  an advertisement re a lost pocket-book, which contained
   'a Brass Pen.' </p>
     <p>Stenography was practised somewhat extensively, to
 judge by the numerous advertisements; but William Mason,
 living at the Hand and Pen, in the Poultry, claimed to be
  'the Author and Teacher of the shortest Shorthand extant. '</p>
     <p>And yet, with all these scholastic advantages, some boys
  would not be happy; but, as boys have done ever since
  boarding schools have been invented, they sometimes ran
  away.  Vide the following advertisements:  'A Gentleman's
  only Child is run from School; he is about 12 years of Age,
  with light Cloaths lin'd with red, a well favour'd brisk Boy,
  with a fair old Wig: speaks a little thro' the Scots, his Name
  Alex Mackdonald: he has been in Spain and Portugal,
  which makes his Parents fear that some Ship may entertain
  him.'  Whoever captured this lad was to be  'sufficiently
  rewarded,'  whilst the next runaway was only valued at  'half
  a guinea and charges,'  although he was dressed so smartly:
   'A little slim, fair hair'd handsome English Boy, who speaks
  French very well, between 11 and 12 Years of Age, with a sad
  colour, coarse Kersay Coat trim'd with flat new Gilded Brass
  Buttons, with a whitish Calla-manca Waistcoat with round
  Plate Silver Buttons, and a little Silver Edging to his Hat,
  with fine white Worsted rowl'd Stockings, and with Silver Plate
Buttons to his sad colour Sagathy Stuff Britches: went away
from School on Thursday, the 6th Inst. Supposed to be gone

<pb n="18" id="p.18"/>

towards Wapping, Rotherif, Greenwich, or Gravesend, he
having been seen near the <placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName> Side asking for a Master
to go to sea.'  Curious how, in every century since Elizabeth's
time, the runaway English boy naturally flies to the water.
Always the same tale: ran away and went to sea. Here
were two well-nurtured lads, more than ordinarily
accomplished, yet they were bitten by this same tarantula.</p>
      <p>Let the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> describe the rising generation of that
time after they had finished their academic career and had
gone to the university. In No. 54, attributed to <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>,
speaking of <placeName key="Cambridge">Cambridge</placeName>, he says,  'Now for their manner of
living: and here I shall have a large field to expatiate in;
but I shall reserve particulars for my intended discourse, and
now only mention one or two of their principal exercises.
The elder proficients employ themselves in inspecting mores
hominum multorum, in getting acquainted with all the signs
and windows in the town. Some have arrived to so great
knowledge, that they can tell every time a butcher kills a
calf, every time any old woman's cat is in the straw; and a
thousand matters as important. One ancient philosopher
contemplates two or three hours every day over a sun-dial;
and is true to the dial.
                <quote rend="blockquote">As the dial to the sun,
                Although it be not shone upon.</quote>

Our younger students are content to carry their speculation
as yet no further than bowling greens, billiard tables, and
such like places.' </p>
   <p>Of the reading men, he says,  'They were ever looked
upon as a people that impaired themselves more by their
strict application to the rules of their order than any other
students whatever.  Others seldom  hurt themselves any
further than to gain weak eyes, and sometimes headaches;
but these philosophers are seized all over with a general
inability, indolence, and weariness, and a certain impatience of
the place they are in, with an heaviness in removing to another.</p>
    <p> The loungers are satisfied with being merely part of the
number of mankind, without distinguishing themselves from
amongst them. They may be said rather to suffer their time
<pb n="19" id="p.19"/>

to pass than to spend it, without regard to the past or prospect
of the future. All they know of life is only in the present
instant, and do not taste even that. When one of this order
happens to be a man of fortune, the expense of his time is
transferred to his coach and horses, and his life is to be
measured by their motion, not his own enjoyments or sufferings.
The chief entertainment one of these philosophers can possibly
propose to himself is to get a relish of dress. This, methinks,
might diversify the person he is weary of, his own dear self,
to himself. I have known these two amusements make one of
these philosophers make a tolerable figure in the world; with
variety of dresses in public assemblies in town, and quick
motion of his horses out of it, now to Bath, now to Tunbridge,
then to <placeName key="Newmarket">Newmarket</placeName>, and then to London, he has, in process
of time, brought it to pass, that his coach and his horses have
been mentioned in all these places.'  And this description,
with a little alteration, would pass as a fair reflex of modern
undergraduate existence at either <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> or <placeName key="Cambridge">Cambridge</placeName>.</p>
    <p>Before closing the question of male education, we must
not forget that in Queen Anne's time was inaugurated that
system of charity schools which has played so prominent a
part in our national system of education, and which has not
yet been superseded by our Board Schools. <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>

<p>GIRLS were not all educated at home-though, doubtless,
the majority of them were, with the exception of their
dancing lessons-but had boarding schools of their own;
and the schoolmistresses seem always to have been harassed
by malicious reports. For instance:  'Whereas it is reported
that Mrs. Overing who keeps a Boarding School at
<placeName key="Bethal Green">Bethnal Green</placeName> near Hackney, is leaving off; this is to give Notice that
the said Report is false, if not Malicious. And that she
continues to take sober young Gentlewomen to board, and teaches
whatsoever is necessary to the Accomplishment of that Sex.'
Take another:  ' Mrs. Elizabeth Tutchin <note place="foot" n="1">She was sister of <persName key="Tutchin,John">Tutchin</persName>, of the <hi rend="italics">Observator</hi>.</note> continues to keep her
School at <placeName key="Highgate">Highgate</placeName>, notwithstanding Reports to the contrary.
Where young Gentlewomen may be soberly Educated, and
taught all sorts of Learning fit for young Gentlewomen.'
Observe the stress that was then laid on the sobriety
inculcated in these establishments. Read the plays-read the
essays of the time-and then, if they are to be taken at all
as a just standard of feminine conduct, you will, undoubtedly,
come to the conclusion that sobriety of conduct was just the
very quality that required instilling into the heads of the
maidenhood of the time. Pert little hoydens-ogling the
men, flirting their fans, their thoughts always running on a
husband-the schoolmistresses of that time must have had
hard work to keep them serious, and need of most dragon-like

 guardianship. They were not taught much, these girls;
 'the Needle, Dancing, and the French Tongue,'  says one- ' a
little Music, on the Harpsichord, or Spinet, to read, write, and
cast accounts in a small way' -this was the sum of their
education. Essentially were they to be housekeepers. Here
is the description an exceptionally accomplished young lady
gives of her own education:<note place="foot" n="2"><hi rend="italics">The Levellers</hi>, a dialogue between two young ladies concerning matrimony, &amp;c.</note>  ' You know my father was a
tradesman, and lived very well by his traffick; and I, being
beautiful, he thought nature had already given me part of my
portion, and therefore he would add a liberal education, that
I might be a complete gentlewoman; away he sent me to the
boarding school; there I learned to dance and sing, to play
on the bass viol, virginals, spinet, and guitar. I learned to
make wax work, japan, paint upon glass, to raise paste, make
sweetmeats, sauces, and everything that was genteel and
fashionable.'  Here we see the best obtainable education of
the town-bred lady. What was a girl's education in the
country like ? <note place="foot" n="3"><hi rend="italics">The Scowrers</hi>, by Shadwell.</note></p>

the watchwords used by the Irish Papists in their massacre of the Protestants in

Earl of Tyrconnel, a bigoted papist, Lieutenant of Ireland.  The words are

said to have contributed greatly in bringing about the Revolution of <date value="1688">1688</date>.</note> upon an old pair of Virginals, that sound worse
than a Tinker's Kettle that he cries his work on.</p>

   <p>We saw that even the accomplished town young lady was
taught how to raise paste, &amp;c.; indeed that was a regular
branch of a girl's education, and all housewifely gifts were
thoroughly appreciated.</p>
   <p><emph>Niece.</emph> Good madam, don't upbraid me with my Mother Bridget,

   <emph>Aunt.</emph> Yes, I say, she was, and spent her time in better Learning than

    <p>But, if girls could not learn pastry-making at home, or
wanted a higher class of education therein, there were the
forerunners of our  'Schools of Cookery'  in the shape of
 'Pastry Schools,'  where the professor demonstrated. Here is
one of them.    'To all Young Ladies at Edw. Kidder's Pastry
School in little Lincoln's Inn Fields, are taught all Sorts of
Pastry and Cookery, Dutch hollow works, and Butter Works,
on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays in the Afternoon,
and on the same days, in the Morning, at his School in <placeName key="Norris
Street">Norris Street</placeName> in <placeName key="St. James's Market">St. James's Market</placeName>, and at his School in St. Martin's
Le Grand, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in the
Afternoon. And at his School at St. Mary Overies Dock,
Mondays Tuesdays and Wednesday mornings from 9 to 12.' </p>
    <p>But one branch of a girl's education seems never to have
been neglected--her dancing. <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName> says, <note place="foot" n="7"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, 66.</note>  'When a girl is
safely brought from her nurse, before she is capable of
forming one simple notion of anything in life, she is delivered to
the hands of her dancing master, and with a collar round her
neck, the pretty wild thing is taught a fantastical gravity of
behaviour, and forced to a particular way of holding her
head, heaving her breast, and moving with her whole body;





<pb n="25" id="p.25"/>


and all this under pain of never having a husband, if she
steps, looks or moves awry.' </p>
    <p>He gives a humorous description of the dancing master:<note place="foot" n="8"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, 376.</note>
  'There was Colonel Jumper's Lady, a Colonel of the Train
 Bands, that has a great Interest in her Parish; she
recommends Mr. Trott for the prettiest Master in Town, that no
 Man teaches a Jigg like him, that she has seen him rise Six
 or Seven Capers together with the greatest Ease imaginable,
 and that his Scholars twist themselves more ways than the
 Scholars of any Master in Town; besides there is Madam
 Prim, the Alderman's Lady, recommends a Master of her Own
 Name, but she declares he is not of their Family, yet a very
 extraordinary Man in his Way; for, besides a very soft Air he
 has in Dancing, he gives them a particular Behaviour at a
 Tea-Table, and in presenting their Snuff Box: to twirl, flip or
 flirt a Fan, and how to place Patches to the best advantage,
 either for Fat or Lean, Long or Oval Faces.' </p>
    <p>Indeed, dancing was much thought of as an
accomplishment, and more will be said of it in its place among the
social habits of the time. One book alone,  'The Dancing
Master'  for <date value="1713">1713</date>, 15th ed., contains 358 different figures
and tunes for country dances. It got to be a fine art, and
books were written on  ' Chorography'  and  'Orchesography,'
illustrated with wonderful and most perplexing diagrams.
A contemporary sketch of a dancing academy is interesting.
It is by Budgell.<note place="foot" n="9"><hi rend="italics">Ibid.</hi> 67.</note>  'I am a Man in Years, and by an honest
Industry in the World have acquired enough to give my
Children a liberal Education, tho' I was an utter Stranger
to it myself. My eldest Daughter, a Girl of Sixteen, has for
some time past been under the Tuition of Monsieur Rigadoon,
a Dancing Master in the City; and I was prevailed upon by
her and her Mother to go last Night to one of his Balls. I
must own to you, Sir, that having never been at any such
Place before, I was very much pleased and surprized with
that Part of his Entertainment which he called French Dancing.
There were several young Men and Women, whose limbs
seemed to have no other Motion but purely what the Musick
gave them. After this Part was over, they began a Diversion


<pb n="26" id="p.26"/>

which they call Country Dancing, and wherein there were
also some things not disagreeable, and divers Emblematical
Figures, compos'd, as I guess, by Wise Men for the Instruction
of Youth.</p>
   <p>Amongst the rest, I observed one, which I think they call <note place="foot" n="10">See Appendix.</note>
Hunt the Squirrel, in which while the Woman flies, the Man
pursues her; but as soon as she turns, he runs away, and she
is obliged to follow.</p>
   <p>The Moral of this Dance does, I think, very aptly
recommend Modesty and Discretion to the Female Sex.</p>
    <p>But as the best Institutions are liable to Corruptions, so,
Sir, I must acquaint you, that very great Abuses are crept into
this Entertainment. I was Amazed to see my Girl handed by,
and handing young Fellows with so much Familiarity; and I
could not have thought it had been in the Child. They very
often made use of a most impudent and lascivious Step called
Setting, which I know not how to describe to you, but by
telling you that it is the very reverse of Back to Back. At
last an impudent young Dog bid the Fiddlers play a Dance
called Mol Patley, <note place="foot" n="11">See Appendix.</note> and after having made two or three Capers,
ran to his Partner, locked his Arms in hers, and whisked her
round Cleverly above Ground in such manner that I, who sat
upon one of the lowest Benches, saw further above her Shoe
than I can think fit to acquaint you with. I could no longer
endure these Enormities; wherefore, just as my Girl was going
to be made a Whirligig, I ran in, seized on the Child, and
carried her home.' </p>
   <p>Poor Budgell! what would have been his feelings could
he have but seen a galop, or a valse a deux temps ?</p>
   <p>We may now consider the girl's education complete, and,
as she may be  'sweet seventeen'  or so, she naturally would
be, if either pretty or witty,  'a TOAST'  among her male
friends. This peculiar institution has its rise in Queen
Anne's time, and is aptly described <note place="foot" n="12"><hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, 31.</note> as  'a new name found
out by the Wits, to make a lady have the same effect, as
burridge in the glass when a man is drinking.'  <persName key="Pope, Alexander">Pope</persName>, even,
could hardly make it out.</p>

 <p>It was an old English custom to put a toast, a roasted
pippin or so, in a hot drink, such as a tankard of spiced ale,
or of sack; and this is whimsically applied as the derivation
of the word used to express the slavish adulation and worship
of the fair sex, as embodied in this custom. <note place="foot" n="13"><hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, 24.</note>  'Many of the
Wits of the last age will assert that the word, in its present
sense, was known among them in their youth, and had its
rise from an accident at the town of Bath, in the reign of
Charles the Second. It happened that, on a public day, a
celebrated beauty of those times was in the Cross Bath, and
one of the crowd of her admirers took a glass of the water in
which the fair one stood and drank her health to the
Company. There was in the place a gay fellow half fuddled, who
offered to jump in, and swore, though he liked not the liquor,
he would have the Toast. He was opposed in his resolution;
yet this whim gave foundation to the present honour which is
done to the lady we mention in our liquors, who has ever
since been called a TOAST. Though this institution had so
trivial a beginning, it is now elevated into a formal order;
and that happy virgin, who is received and drunk to at their
meetings, has no more to do in this life but to judge and
accept of the first good offer. The manner of her
inauguration is much like that of the choice of a Doge in Venice: it is
performed by balloting; and when she is so chosen, she reigns
indisputably for that ensuing year; but must be re-elected
anew to prolong her empire a moment beyond it. When she
is regularly chosen, her name is written with a diamond on a
drinking glass. The hieroglyphic of the diamond is to shew
her that her value is imaginary; and that of the glass to
acquaint her, that her condition is frail, and depends on the
hand which holds her.'  Many of the members of the '<orgName key="Kit Cat Club">Kit Cat Club</orgName>'
-Lords Halifax, Wharton, Lansdowne, and Carbury,
Mr. Maynwaring and others-thus immortalised their Toasts.


<pb n="28" id="p.28"/>
One, by Lord Lansdowne, will amply serve as an
illustration--</p>
          <quote rend="blockquote">Love is enjoyn'd to make his favourite toast,
          And HARE'S the goddess that delights him most.</quote>

    <p>There were two very famous toasts in Queen Anne's
time; one in particular was Lady Sunderland, a daughter of
the Duke of Marlborough, who was known by the sobriquet
of  'The Little Whig.'  She was the toast of her party, and
her nickname was so well known that it is said the first
stone of <persName key="Vanbrugh,John">Sir John Vanbrugh</persName>'s theatre in the Haymarket had
 'Little Whig'  cut upon it. The other was Mademoiselle
Spanheim, the daughter of Baron Spanheim, Ambassador
Extraordinary from the Court of Prussia. She was very
lovely; indeed, her good looks were proverbial, as the current
expression,  'as beautiful as Madam Spanheim,'  shows. She
was married early in the year 171O to the Marquis de
Montandre. Her father died here in November of the same year,
aged 81 ; and the Queen presented the Marchioness de
Montandre with a thousand guineas, which was the usual present
then given to an ambassador on taking his leave.

<p>WE will suppose our toast to escape the perils to which her
position exposed her, and was not forcibly carried off by some
bold knight, as had been known in this reign <note place="foot" n="1"><hi rend="italics"><persName key="Luttrell,Narcissus">Luttrell</persName>'s Diary</hi>, Sept. 12, <date value="1710">1710</date>.</note>- ' Same
evening Sir Alexander Cumming, Knight of the Shire for
Aberdeen, carried off from the Ring in Hyde Park madam
Dennis and married her; she is said to be worth about
&#x00A3;pound;pound;16,000.'  Probably his position stood him in good stead, for it
fared differently with one Haagen Swendsen, <note place="foot" n="2">British Museum, 515, l. 2, 196.</note> who was, in <date value="1702">1702</date>,
convicted and executed for stealing Mrs. Rawlins, an heiress.
Nowadays, he would have been unhesitatingly acquitted,
even if he had ever been prosecuted, as there was no real
case against him, and Mrs. Rawlins married him of her own
free will.</p>
   <p>That people could be married young enough is rendered
sufficiently evident by the very painful case of Sir George
Downing and Mary Forester, which excited much interest in
the last year of Anne's reign. It is very lucidly put as a case
for counsel's opinion<note place="foot" n="3"><hi rend="italics">The Counsellor's Plea for the Divorce of Sir G. D. and Mrs. F.</hi>, <date value="1715">1715</date>.</note>.</p>
                        <p> 'THE CASE.
   'I. G. D. without the Knowledge and Consent of his
Father (then alive, but accounted not of sound Judgment)
was at the Age of Fifteen, by the Procurement and Persuasion



<pb n="30" id="p.30"/>
of those in whose Keeping he was, Marry'd, according to the
Church form, to M. F. of the Age of Thirteen.</p>
   <p>'2. This young Couple was put to Bed, in the Day time,
according to Custom, and continu'd there a little while, but in
the Presence of the Company, who all testify they touched not
one the other; and after that, they came together no more;
-the young Gentleman going immediately Abroad, the young
Woman continuing with her Parents.</p>
   <p>' 3. G. D., after Three or Four Years Travel, return'd home
to England, and being sollicited to live with his lawful Wife,
refus'd it, and frequently and publickly declar'd he never
would compleat the Marriage.</p>
   <p>'4. Fourteen Years have pass'd since this Marriage
Ceremony was perform'd, each Party having (as is natural to
think) contracted an incurable Aversion to each the other, is
very desirous to be set at liberty; and accordingly
Application is made to the Legislative power to dissolve this Marriage,
and to give each Party leave, if they think fit, to Marry
elsewhere.</p>
   <p>'The Reasons against such Dissolution are:-
   'First. That each Party was Consenting to the Marriage,
      and was Old enough to give such Consent, according to
      the known Laws of the Kingdom; the Male being
      Fifteen Years Old, the Female Thirteen; whereas the
      Years of Consent are, by Law, Fourteen and Twelve.</p>
   <p>'Secondly. They were actually Marry'd according to the
    Form prescrib'd by the Church of England; the
       Minister pronouncing those solemn Words us'd by our
       Saviour, Those whom God has joyn'd let no Man put
       asunder. They are therefore Man and Wife both by
       the Laws of God and of the Land; and, since nothing
       but Adultery can dissolve a Marriage, and no Adultery
       is pretended here, the Marriage continues indissoluble.' </p>

   <p>And, in the course of some very able pleading, the author
says,  'My Lords, the Years of Consent are not fix'd to
Fourteen or Twelve either by Nature, Reason, or any Law of God;
but purely and meerly by the positive Laws of the Land, which

<pb n="31" id="p.31"/>

may change them to Morrow; <note place="foot" n="4">But it never has been changed, and is now in force.</note> and if they were chang'd
to Day, no Man in England would, I dare affirm it, be
dissatisfy'd; it seems so senseless and unreasonable to give our
Children the Power of disposing of their Persons for ever, at
an Age when we will not let them dispose of Five Shillings
without Direction and Advice.' </p>
   <p>However, no pleading could prevail against the actual
law, and this singularly married couple remained, legally,
man and wife.</p>
   <p>In <date value="1690">1690</date> there was a pamphlet issued by  'A Person of
Quality,' <note place="foot" n="5"><hi rend="italics">Marriage Promoted</hi>, &amp;c.</note> advocating a tax on bachelors, and on April 22,
<date value="1695">1695</date>, William III. gave his assent to an Act intituled  'An

Deficiencies of Several Funds therein mentioned,'  these taxes
were kept on, and were to be paid until Aug. I, <date value="1706">1706</date>, so that
they were in force during four years of Anne's reign.</p>
    <p>In a most amusing tract <note place="foot" n="6"><hi rend="italics">The Levellers.</hi></note> this Act is alluded to as a law
discouraging marriage, and proposes to make bachelors of 24
and widowers of 50 pay 20s. per annum, and estimates that a
revenue of 2 and one half millions sterling would accrue.</p>
   <p>There was every freedom of intercourse allowed between
the young of both sexes: they visited, and we have seen
that they mixed in the dancing academies. There was also
the custom of valentines, now become obsolete and
unmeaning. <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName> describes it well, as indeed he did everything he
saw in England.  ' On the Eve of the 14th of Feb., St.
Valentine's Day, a Time when all living Nature inclines to couple, the
Young Folks in England, and Scotland too, by a very ancient
Custom, celebrate a little Festival that tends to the same End.
An equal Number of Maids and Batchelors get together, each
writes their true or some feign'd Name upon separate Billets,
which they Roll up, and draw by way of Lots, the Maids taking
the Men's Billets, and the Men the Maids; so that each of the
Young Men lights upon a Girl that he calls his Valentine,
and each of the Girls upon a young Man which she calls hers:
By this means each has two Valentines; but the Man sticks
faster to the Valentine that is fallen to him, than to the
Valentine to whom he is fallen. Fortune having thus divided the
Company into so many Couples, the Valentines give Balls and
Treats to their Mistresses, wear their Billets several Days upon
their Bosoms or Sleeves, and this little Sport often ends in Love.
There is another kind of Valentine; which is the first young
Man or Woman that Chance throws in your Way in the Street,
or elsewhere, on that Day.' </p>
  <p> The whole of the literature of the day speaks of the tendency



<pb n="33" id="p.33"/>



of young men to avoid the trammels of matrimony.
Most probably the wild blood engendered in Charles the
Second's time had not yet cooled down, and the licence then
habitual, had hardly been superseded by decorum; but there
were other causes, one of which was the introduction of
marriage settlements. These were comparatively new. <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>
calls attention to it:<note place="foot" n="7">The <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, 199.</note>  'Honest Coupler, the Conveyancer, says
 " He can distinguish, upon sight of the parties before they
have opened upon any point of their business, which of the
two has the daughter to sell." Coupler is of our Club, and I
have frequently heard him declaim upon this subject, and
assert "that the Marriage Settlements, which are now used,
have grown fashionable even within his memory." ' </p>
   <p>When the theatre, in some late reigns, owed its chief
support to those scenes which were written to put matrimony
out of countenance and render that state terrible, then it was
that pin money first prevailed; and all the other articles were
inserted, which create a diffidence, and intimate to the young
people that they are very soon to be in a state of war with
each other; though this has seldom happened, except the
fear of it had been expressed. Coupler will tell you also
 'that jointures were never frequent until the age before his
own; but the women were contented with the third part of
the estate the law allotted them, and scorn'd to engage with
men whom they thought capable of abusing their Children.'  He
has also informed me ' that those who are the oldest Benchers
when he came to the Temple told him, the first Marriage
Settlement of considerable length was the invention of an old
Serjeant, who took the opportunity of two testy fathers, who
were ever squabbling, to bring about an alliance between
their Children. These fellows knew each other to be knaves,
and the Serjeant took hold of their mutual diffidence, for the
benefit of the Law, to extend the Settlement to three skins
of parchment.'  This was undoubtedly the substance of a
genuine conversation with a lawyer, and is further referred
to in a subsequent paper. Nor did <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName> like pin money:
he not only disclaims against it in his essays, but in his
dramatic works-in  'The Tender Husband,'  where two fathers

 <pb id="p.34" n="34"/>

are squabbling over settlements. One, Sir Harry Gubbin,
says-</p>
   <p>Look y', Mr. Tipkin, the main Article with me is that Foundation of
Wives Rebellion-that cursed Pin Money-Five hundred Pounds per
annum Pin Mony.
   <emph>Tipkin.</emph> The Word Pin Money, Sir Harry, is a Term--
   <emph>Sir H.</emph> It is a Term, Brother, we never had in our Family, nor ever
will. Make her Jointure in Widowhood accordingly large, but Four
hundred Pounds a Year is enough to give no account of.
   <emph>Tipkin.</emph> Well, Sir Harry, since you can't swallow these Pins, I will
abate to Four Hundred Pounds.
   <emph>Sir H.</emph> And to Mollifie the Article, as well as Specifie the Uses, we'll
put in the Names of several Female Utensils, as Needles, Knitting
Needles, Tape, Thread, Scissors, Bodkins, Fans, Playbooks, with other
Toys of that Nature.</p>
   <p><persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName>, too, must needs have a fling at it, and wrote a
whole essay on pin money, <note place="foot" n="8"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, 295.</note> and, in a letter therein, gives a
doleful case.  'The education of these my Children, who,
contrary to my expectation, are born to me every Year,
straightens me so much that I have begged their Mother to
free me from the Obligation of the above mentioned Pin
Money, that it may go towards making a Provision for her
family. This Proposal makes her Noble Blood swell in her
Veins, insomuch, that finding me a little tardy in her last
Quarter's Payment, she threatens every Day to arrest me: and
proceeds so far as to tell me, that if I do not do her Justice, I
shall die in a Jayl. To this she adds, when her Passion will
let her argue calmly, that she has several Play Debts on her
Hand, which must be discharged very suddenly, and that she
cannot lose her Money as becomes a Woman of her Fashion,
if she makes me any Abatements in this Article.' </p>
   <p>Supposing the vexed question of settlements or no
settlements disposed of, a thing of primary importance before
marriage was to provide the ring, and that, according to the
custom of the day, must have a posy on it.<note place="foot" n="9"><hi rend="italics">Ibid.</hi> 59.</note>   'He has likewise
promised me to get the measure of his Mistress's marriage
finger, with a design to make a posy in the fashion of a ring
which shall exactly fit it.'  The posy was mostly a
couplet and as not much sentiment or poetry can be compressed into



<pb n="35" id="p.35"/>


two lines, the posies, as far as we can judge, are not very
brilliant efforts of genius. The appended examples are all
genuine of the time, as they are taken from the newspaper
advertisements of things lost.

  <p> And now a word or two as to the Marriages of those times,
and one is fairly surprised at the very little fuss that was
generally made about it. On the Stage, a clergyman coupled
the pair presently, or the young people just left the room and
came back in a few minutes, duly married. And this really
was somewhat like real life, and not a travesty.  'Aunt,
Aunt, run for Doctor Dromedary, and let us be Married before
the Sun reposes,' <note place="foot" n="10"><hi rend="italics">Tunbridge Walks</hi>, by Thos. Baker, <date value="1703">1703</date>.</note>  was a not unnatural request for a young
lady to make. A custom had grown up to avoid the noise
and riot of a public wedding, which, besides, was very
expensive-open house being but a small part of it; so it used to be,
that the young people would get married with just sufficient
legal witness, and with the full consent of the parents. Even
the middle class were glad to get rid of the noise of drums,
etc. (which still survives in the marrow bones and cleavers
-the rough music of a lower-class wedding).
           <quote rend="blockquote">Here Rows of Drummers stand in Martial File,
           And with their Vellom Thunder shake the Pile,
           To greet the new made Bride;</quote> <note place="foot" n="11"><hi rend="italics">Trivia</hi>, by <persName key="Gay,John">Gay</persName>.</note>

and in one of <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Spectators</hi> (364) is a letter commencing
 'I was marry'd on Sunday last, and went peaceably to Bed;
but, to my Surprize, was awaken'd the next Morning by the
Thunder of a Set of Drums.'  For this noise the unfortunate
bridegroom had to pay pretty smartly.</p>
    <p>These private marriages had their inconveniences, as
the following advertisement <note place="foot" n="12"><hi rend="italics">Post boy</hi>, May 24/27, <date value="1712">1712</date>.</note>
shows:  'Whereas, for several




<pb n="36" id="p.36"/>
Reasons, the Marriage of Mrs. Frances Herbert to Capt.
James Price, Son to Brigadier Price of Ireland, was kept
private for some time, which has occasioned some insolent
People to censure her Virtue; to prevent which Censures
for the future, it is thought proper to give this Publick Notice
that she was marry'd to the said Capt James Price on the
18th Day of June last at the Parish Church of St. Bennet's,
Pauls Wharf, London, by License and before Witnesses.' </p>
   <p><persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName> adverts to this custom of private marriage as being
very common.  'In England, a Boy may marry at fourteen
Years old, and a Girl at twelve, in spight of Parents and
Guardians, without any Possibility of dissolving their
Marriage, tho' one be the Son of a Hog-driver, and the other a
Duke's Daughter. <note place="foot" n="13">There was a law against marrying the heiress of a noble family before the
age of twenty-one years without the consent of her guardians.</note>  This often produces very whimsical
Matches. There is another thing in it odd enough; for those
Children by this means not only become their own Masters,
but obtain this Advantage at a very easy Rate. If to be
marry'd it were necessary to be proclaim'd three Times in a
full Congregation, their Friends would be inform'd of the
Matter, and might find a Way to disswade a little Girl, that
had taken it into her Head to have a Husband, by giving her
fine Cloaths, pretty Babies, and every Thing else that might
amuse her; but the Wedding is clapp'd up so privately, that
People are amaz'd to see Women brought to Bed of legitimate
Children, without having heard a Word of the Father. The
Law, indeed, requires that the Bans should be publish'd; but
the strange Practice of a dispensing Power makes the Law of
no Manner of Use. To proclaim Bans is a Thing no Body
now cares to have done; very few are willing to have their
Affairs declar'd to all the World in a publick Place, when for
a Guinea they may do it Snug, and without Noise; and my
good Friends the Clergy, who find their Accounts in it, are not
very zealous to prevent it. Thus, then, they buy what they
call a Licence, and are marry'd in their Closets, in Presence of
a couple of Friends, that serve for Witnesses; and this ties them
for ever: Nay, the Abuse is yet greater, for they may be marry'd
without a Licence in some Chappels, which have that Privilege


<pb n="37" id="p.37"/>



. . . . Hence comes the Matches between Footmen and
young Ladies of Quality, who you may be sure live no very
easy Life together afterwards: Hence, too, happen
Polygamies, easily conceal'd, and too much practised.' </p>
   <p>Sometimes they were married at a tavern. <note place="foot" n="14"><hi rend="italics">Postman</hi>, August 28/31, <date value="1703">1703</date>.</note>  'Whereas a
Couple was marryed at the Ship Tavern without <placeName key="Temple Barr">Temple Barr</placeName>,
London, in March, <date value="1696">1696</date>. The Parson, or any other that was
then Present, is desired to come or send to the Publisher of
this Paper, and give an account of the said Marriage, and
shall be satisfied for their charges of coming or sending, and
loss of time.' </p>
   <p>The irregular marriages were a crying evil of the
times in spite of legislative efforts to stop them. There was an
Act passed, 6 and 7 Wm. III. cap. 7, sec. 52, for the better
levying the 5s. duty on licences, and imposing a penalty of
100l. for marrying without one-and the 7 and 8 Wm. III. cap.
35 recites this Act, and says it was ineffectual, because the
penalty of 100l. was not extended to every offence of the
same parson-because the parsons employed poor and
indigent ministers, without benefices, or settled habitations,
and because many ministers, being in prison for debt or
otherwise, married persons for lucre and gain.</p>
   <p>There have been certain churches and chapels <note place="foot" n="15">Judging by the 8th and 9th Wm. III. cap. 26, which took away their
pretended privileges, these were White Friars, the Savoy, Salisbury Court, Ram
Alley, Mitre Court, Fuller's Rents, Baldwin's Gardens, Montague Close, the
Minories, Mint and Clink or Dead Man's Place; but there were many others.</note> exempted
from the visitation of the ordinary-and the ministers of
such, usually married without licence or banns-and these
were called  'lawless churches.'  In Anne's reign there was one
famous one, <placeName key="St. James'">St. James'</placeName>, Duke's Place, by Aldgate. Another
was Holy Trinity, Minories, which exercised the same
privilege. The Savoy had not yet been much heard of,
and they did a good business. In the former case, privilege
was claimed, because the Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens
of London were lords of the manor and patrons of the
church, and therefore set up an exemption from the
jurisdiction (in matters ecclesiastical) of the Bishop of London.
In the latter, it was pleaded that the living was held direct




<pb n="38" id="p.38"/>

from the Crown, in whose gift it was, and that the minister
held the same by an instrument of dotation, under the Great
Seal of England, and that it was neither a rectory nor
vicarage institutive.  However, the arm of the ecclesiastical
law did once reach Adam Elliott, rector of <placeName key="St. James'">St. James'</placeName>, and on
Feb. 17, <date value="1686">1686</date>, he was suspended for three years, <foreign lang="LA">ab officio et
beneficio</foreign>, for having married, or having suffered persons to be
married, at the said church, without banns or licence. He was,
however, reinstituted on May 28, <date value="1687">1687</date>, after having petitioned
the Ecclesiastical Commissioners; but he began his old trade
very shortly afterwards, in fact the next day, as appears in
the marriage register of the church- ' There were no
marriages from the tenth of March till the 29 day of May'  <date value="1687">1687</date>.</p>
   <p>People could be, and were, married without licence, both
in the Fleet and Queen's Bench Prisons. It is probable that
prisoners there were duly and properly married by banns in
the prison chapel, long before <date value="1674">1674</date>, which is the date of
the earliest illicit Fleet Register in the Bishop of London's
registry; for, in a letter, Sept. <date value="1613">1613</date>,
we read: <note place="foot" n="16">Lansdowne MSS., 93-17.</note>  'Now I am to
enform you that an ancyentt acquayntance of yours and myne
is yesterday maryed in the Fleette, one Mr. Georg Lestor,
and hath maryed Mris Babbington, Mr. Thomas Fanshawe
mother-in-lawe. It is sayed she is a woman of good wealthe
so as nowe the man wylle able to lyve and mayntayn hymself
in prison, for hether unto he hath byne in poor estate.'  But,
at all events, the law was set at nought in Anne's reign, as it
was for many a long year afterwards. In <date value="1702">1702</date> the chaplain
was Robert Elborough, who married but few without banns
or licence,  'but under a colour doth allow his clerk
Bartholomew Basset to do what he pleases,'  and in <date value="1714">1714</date> Mr. John
Taylor filled the same office, but he does not seem to have
solemnised matrimony at the Fleet. There was, however, a
low clergyman, named John Gaynam, otherwise Doctor
Gaynam, who did a large trade there in marriages, from <date value="1709">1709</date>
to <date value="1740">1740</date>. A little anecdote of him, though not in Queen
Anne's time, may not be amiss. He was giving evidence at
the Old Bailey on the trial of Robert Hussey for bigamy, in
<date value="1733">1733</date>.</p>

<pb n="39" id="p.39"/>

Rainbow Coffee House, the corner of <placeName key="Fleet Ditch">Fleet Ditch</placeName>, and entered the

   <p>The Queen's Bench was not behind its brother of the Fleet,
but there even greater abuses existed-laymen officiating. <note place="foot" n="17">The <hi rend="italics">Postboy</hi>, October 13/16, <date value="1711">1711</date>.</note>
 ' 'Tis expected that a Bill to prevent clandestine Marriages,
under a severe Corporal Penalty, will be brought in very
early next Session of Parliament. For which 'tis said too
just Occasion has been given by a Discovery lately made



<pb n="40" id="p.40"/>

that Laymen have been suffer'd to marry at the Queen's
Bench; and that John Sarjeant, who now acts there again as
Clerk, has forg'd Certificates of pretended Marriages, for which
he keeps Register books, with large blanks almost in every
Page, whereby very mischievous Frauds are practicable. For
preventing whereof, the late Chaplain labour'd hard with the
most proper Person to command the said books out of the
Clerk's Custody, and not prevailing, resign'd his Office, which
he had discharg'd among the Prisoners, both in the House
and in the Rules, above five years, charitably, having never
receiv'd one Farthing of the Fees thereto annexed.-WILLIAM
TIPPING.' </p>
   <p>This evidently refers to the Marriage Act of Queen Anne
(10 Anne, c. 19), which received the royal assent on May 22,
<date value="1712">1712</date>. This was a short Act smuggled in in a long money
bill about duties on  'Sope'  and paper, linen, silks, calicoes,
stampt vellom, etc. It renewed, from June 24, <date value="1712">1712</date>, the
penalty of 100l. attaching to the performance of illegal
matches, giving half the penalty to the informer, and,  'if
any gaoler or keeper of any prison shall be privy to, or
knowingly permit, any marriage to be solemnised in his said
prison, before publication of banns, or license obtained as
aforesaid, he shall for every such offence forfeit the sum of
one hundred pounds to be recovered and distributed as
aforesaid.'  There, then, was an extra duty of 5s. imposed upon
every marriage licence, or certificate of marriage.</p>
    <p>Marriages were made easy. You could go a country
walk and pop in and get married. A newly built church at
<placeName key="Hampstead">Hampstead</placeName> thus <note place="foot" n="18">The <hi rend="italics">Postboy</hi>, April 18/20, <date value="1710">1710</date>.</note>advertises:  'As there are many weddings
at Sion Chapel, <placeName key="Hampstead">Hampstead</placeName>, five Shillings only is required for
all the Church fees of any Couple that are married there,
provided they bring with them a license or Certificate, according
to the Act of Parliament. Two Sermons are continued to be
preached in the said Chapel every Sunday, and the place will
be given to any Clergyman that is willing to accept of it, to be
approved of.'  Early in George the First's time, in <date value="1716">1716</date>, they
offered  'that all persons, upon bringing a licence, and who
shall have their wedding dinner in the gardens, may be

<pb n="41" id="p.41"/>


married in the said Chapel, without giving any fee or reward
whatsoever.' </p>
   <p>Whilst on the subject of curious marriages, the following
may well be noticed, extracted from the Parish Register:
 'John Bridmore and Anne Sellwood, both of Chiltern All
Saints, were married October 17, <date value="1714">1714</date>.</p>
   <p>'The aforesaid Anne Sellwood was married in her Smock,
without any clothes or head gier on.' </p>
   <p>This is not uncommon, the object being, according to a
vulgar error, to exempt the husband from the payment of any
debts his wife may have contracted in her ante-nuptial
condition. This error seems to have been founded on a
misconception of the law, as it is laid down <note place="foot" n="19"><hi rend="italics">Bacon's Abridgment</hi>, Tit. Baron and Feme.</note> that  'the husband
is liable for the wife's debts, because he acquires an absolute
interest in the personal estate of the wife,'  etc. An unlearned
person from this might conclude, and not unreasonably, that
if his wife had no estate whatever, he could not incur any
liability.</p>
   <p>Anyhow, after marriage they were liable, as the following
gentlemen knew:  'Whereas Elizabeth Stephenson, Wife of
George Stephenson, late of Falken Court, near the Queen's
Bench, in Southwark, hath Eloped from her said Husband, and
since hath contracted several Debts with a design to Ruin her
said Husband. These are therefore to give notice to the
Publick, That the said George Stephenson will not on any
Account whatever Pay or allow of any Debt so Contracted
by the said Elizabeth Stephenson, either before or since her
elopement.'   'Whereas Isabella Goodyear, the Daughter of
Rich. Cliffe of Brixhome in the County of Devon, and Wife
of Aaron Goodyear of London, Merchant, about 18 months
since abandon'd and forsook the Bed and since the Board of
Aaron her said Husband, carrying with her in Goods, Plate,
and other Goods to the value of &#x00A3;pound;pound;200 and upwards, and whereas
the said Isabella hath as well been sollicited by the said Aaron
her Husband, as also by several of his acquaintance, to return
to and Cohabit with him, under all assurances of being civilly
receiv'd and maintain'd according to his quality and
circumstances, which the said Isabella hath, and still doth obstinately

<pb n="42" id="p.42"/>

refuse. These are therefore to give notice to all Traders, and
all other persons whatsoever, that from and after this present
Notice they do not maintain, sustain, or detain the said
Isabella from the said Aaron her Husband, or any of his
Goods or Plate carryed off by the said Isabella, either by
lending her Money or Selling her Goods, or by any other
ways whatsoever, under penalty of the law, and forfeiture of
the credit, if any, given to the said Isabella from the Notice
hereof.' </p>
   <p>Having discussed the private hole-and-corner, and
clandestine marriages, it may be well to inquire the reasons why
these were preferred to the more ceremonious ones. Mainly
on the score of expense, and to get rid of the uproarious
and senseless festivities which accompanied them. Let <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName>
describe what one was like:  'One of the Reasons that they
have for marrying secretly, as they generally do in England, is
that thereby they avoid a great deal of Expence and Trouble.
. . . Persons of Quality, and many others who imitate them,
have lately taken up the Custom of being marry'd very late at
Night in their Chamber, and very often at some Country
House. <note place="foot" n="20">Usually at the father's or guardian's of the lady.</note>
 They increase their Common Bill of Fare for some
Days; they dance, they play, they give themselves up for some
small Time to Pleasure; but all this they generally do without
Noise, and among very near Relations. Formerly in France
they gave Livrees de Noces, which was a knot of Ribbands, to be
worn by the Guests upon their Arms; but that is practised now
only among Peasants. In England it is done still among the
greatest Noblemen. These Ribbands they Call Favours,<note place="foot" n="21">This custom partially survives, and originated in a division among the guests
of the ribbons worn by the bride and bridegroom. These favours were worn for
some weeks in the hat, and were made of a pretty large knot of ribbons of various
colours-gold, silver, carnation, and white. </note> and
give them not only to those that are at the Wedding, but
to five hundred People besides; they send them about, and
distribute them at their own houses. . . . Among the Citizens
and plain Gentlemen (which is what they call the Gentry) they
sometimes give these Favours; but it is very Common to avoid
all Manner of Expence as much as Possible. When those of
a middling Condition have a mind to be so extravagant as to

<pb n="43" id="p.43"/>


marry in Publick (which very rarely happens) they invite a
Number of Friends and Relations; every one puts on new
Cloaths, <note place="foot" n="22">This was absolutely necessary, and mourning was also temporarily left off,
unless for a very near relation recently deceased.</note> and dresses finer than ordinary; the Men lead the
Women, they get into Coaches, and so go in Procession, and
are marry'd in full Day at Church. After Feasting and
Dancing, and having made merry that Day and the next, they
take a Trip into the Country, and there divert themselves very
pleasantly. These are extraordinary Weddings. The Ordinary
ones, as I said before, are generally incognito. The
Bridegroom, that is to say, the Husband that is to be, and the
Bride, who is the Wife that is to be, conducted by their Father
and Mother, or by those that serve them in their room, and
accompany'd by two Bride men and two Bride maids, go early
in the Morning with a Licence <note place="foot" n="23">The licence was generally shown the clergyman the day before the wedding,
and an appointment made for the ceremony.</note> in their Pocket and call up
Mr. Curate and his Clerk, tell him their Business; are marry'd
with a low Voice, and the Doors shut; tip the Minister a
Guinea, and the Clerk a Crown ; steal softly out, one one way,
and t'other another, either on Foot or in Coaches; go different
Ways to some Tavern at a Distance from their own Lodgings,
or to the House of some trusty Friend, there have a good
Dinner, and return Home at Night as quietly as Lambs. If the
Drums and Fiddles have notice of it they will be sure to be
with them by Day break, making a horrible Racket, till they
have got the Pence; and, which is worst of all, the whole
Murder will come out. Before they go to bed they take
t'other Glass, &amp;c., and when Bedtime is come the Bride men
pull off the Bride's Garters, which she had before unty'd that
they might hang down, and so prevent a Curious Hand coming
too near her knee. This done, and the Garters being fastened
to the Hats of the Gallants, the Bride maids carry the Bride
into the Bed chamber, where they undress her,<note place="foot" n="24">There was then, and may be now, a curious superstition that every pin
about the bride must be thrown away and lost. There would be no luck if one
remained. Nor must the bridesmaid keep one, for should she do so she certainly
would not be married before Whitsuntide.</note> and lay her
in Bed. The Bridegroom, who by the Help of his Friends is
undress'd in some other Room, comes in his Night-gown as soon




<pb n="44" id="p.44"/>
as possible to his Spouse, who is surrounded by Mother, Aunt,
Sisters, and Friends, and without any farther Ceremony gets
into Bed. Some of the Women run away, others remain, and
the Moment afterwards they are all got together again. <note place="foot" n="25"><persName key="Pepys,Samuel">Pepys</persName> tells of a frolic Lady Castlemaine and the beautiful Frances Terese
Stuart (the original of the Britania on the copper coinage) had : 'That they two
must be married-and married they were-with ring and all other ceremonies of
Church service, and ribbands, and a sack posset in bed, and flinging the stocking.'</note> The
Bridemen Take the Bride's Stockings, and the Bridemaids the
Bridegroom's; both sit down at the Bed's Feet and fling the
Stockings over their Heads, endeavouring to direct them so as
that they may fall upon the marry'd Couple. If the Man's
stockings, thrown by the Maids, fall upon the Bridegroom's
Head, it is a Sign she will quickly be marry'd herself; and the
same Prognostick holds good of the Woman's Stockings
thrown by the Man. Oftentimes these young People engage
with one another upon the Success of the Stockings, tho' they
themselves look upon it to be nothing but Sport. While some
amuse themselves agreeably with these little Follies, others are
preparing a good Posset, which is a kind of Cawdle, a Potion
made up of Milk, Wine, Yolk of Eggs, Sugar, Cinnamon,
Nutmeg, etc. This they present to the young Couple, who swallow it
down as fast as they can to get rid of so troublesome Company;
the Bridegroom prays, scolds, entreats them to be gone, and
the Bride says ne'er a Word, but thinks the more. If they
obstinately continue to retard the Accomplishment of their
Wishes, the Bridegroom jumps up in his Shirt, which frightens
the Women, and puts them to Flight. The Men follow them,
and the Bridegroom returns to the Bride.</p>
   <p>They never fail to bring them another Sack Posset next
Morning, which they spend in such Amusements as you may
easily imagine. The young Woman, more gay and more
contented than ever she was in her Life, puts on her finest Cloaths
(for she was married only in a Mob<note place="foot" n="26">A mob was a deshabille dress, scarcely ever mentioned in terms of
commendation.</note>), the dear Husband does
the same, and so do the young Guests; they laugh, they
dance, they make merry; and these Pleasures continue a
longer or shorter time, according to the several Circumstances
of Things.' </p>



<pb n="45" id="p.45"/>



   <p>There was no going away for the honeymoon for the
newly married couple. That trying season was spent at
home, in a somewhat stately manner-receiving company, and
must have been excessively irksome, as the following amusing
account of a citizen's honeymoon shows: <note place="foot" n="27"><hi rend="italics">Guardian</hi>, No, 113.  2 <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, 479.</note>  'I have lately
married a very pretty body, who being somewhat younger
and richer than myself, I was advised to go a wooing to her in a
finer suit of clothes than ever I wore in my life: for I love to
dress plain, and suitable to a man of my rank. How ever, I
gained her heart by it. Upon the wedding day I put myself,
according to custom, in another suit, fire new, with silver
buttons to it. I am so out of Countenance among my
neighbours, upon being so fine, that I heartily wish my clothes well
worn out. I fancy every body observes me as I walk the
street, and long to be in my own plain geer again. Besides,
forsooth, they have put me in a Silk Night gown and a gaudy
fool's cap, and make me now and then stand in the window
with it. I am ashamed to be dandled thus, and cannot look
in the glass without blushing to see myself turned into such a
pretty little master. They tell me I must appear in my
wedding suit for the first month at least; after which I am resolved
to come again to my every day's clothes, for at present every
day is Sunday with me. ... I forgot to tell you of my white
gloves, which they say, too, I must wear all the first month.' </p>
   <p>I am afraid some of these good gentlemen beat their wives
sometimes; and even the gallant Sir Richard <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>
says : <note place="foot" n="28"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, 479.</note>  'I
cannot deny but there are perverse Jades that fall to Men's
Lots, with whom it requires more than common Proficiency in
Philosophy to be able to live. When these are joined to Men
of warm Spirits, without Temper or Learning, they are
frequently corrected with Stripes; but one of our famous Lawyers
is of opinion, That this ought to be used sparingly.'  On the
other hand, we hear much of hen-pecked men-so that it is
probable, so far as matrimonial jars were concerned, the world
wagged then much as now-without the facility for separation
and divorce which now exists.</p>

long fit of Sickness last Winter, at Half a Crown a day, a fellow waiting
at your Gate, to bring me Intelligence, but you unfortunately recovered,
and I Lost all my Obliging pains for your Service.</p>

    <p>This, of course, is exaggeration, but although, as we have
seen, people were sparing in expense over births or marriages,
they were absolutely lavish over funerals, and the undertaker
could well afford to disgorge some of his gains. Was it the
funeral of a rich man, the corpse must straightway be
embalmed, roughly though it may be.  'Have you brought the
Sawdust and Tar for embalming ? Have you the hangings and
the Sixpenny nails for my Lord's Coat of Arms ?'  The
hatchment must be put up, and mutes must be stationed at intervals
from the hall door to the top of the stairs.  'Come, you that are
to be Mourners in the House, put on your Sad Looks, and walk
by Me that I may sort you. Ha you! a little more upon the
Dismal. This Fellow has a good Mortal look, place him near
the Corps; That Wanscoat Face must be o' top of the Stairs;
That Fellow's almost in a Fright (that looks as if he were full
of some strange misery) at the Entrance of the Hall. So !-but
I'll fix you all myself. Let's have no Laughing now on any

of a Great Man's Service, and show you the Pleasure of
receiving Wages ? Did not I give you Ten, then Fifteen and
Twenty Shillings a Week to be Sorrowful? and the more I
give you, I think the Glader you are!' </p>
   <p>The undertaker issued his handbills-gruesome things,
with grinning skulls and shroud-clad corpses, thigh bones,
mattocks and pickaxes, hearses, and what not.  'These are to
Notice, that Mr. John Elphick, Woollen Draper, over against
St. Michael's Church in Lewes, hath a good Hearse, a Velvet
Pall, Mourning Cloaks, and Black Hangings for Rooms to be
Lett at Reasonable Rates.</p>

near Red Lion Street end, maketh Coffins, Shrouds, letteth
Palls, Cloaks, and Furnisheth with all other things necessary
for Funerals at Reasonable Rates.' </p>
   <p>The dead were then buried in woollen, which was rendered
compulsory by the Acts 30 Car. II. c. 3 and 36 ejusdem c. I.
The first Act was entitled  'An Act for the lessening the
importation of Linnen from beyond the Seas, and the
encouragement of the Woollen and Paper Manufactures of the
Kingdome.'  It prescribed that the curate of every parish shall keep a
register, to be provided at the charge of the parish, wherein to

<figure id="fig.6" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00006"><head>A CORPSE</head></figure>

enter all burials and affidavits of persons being buried in
woollen ; the affidavit to be taken by any justice of the peace,
mayor, or such like chief officer in the parish where the body
was interred ; and if there be no officer, then by any curate
within the county where the corpse was buried (except him in
whose parish the corpse was buried), who must administer the
oath, and set his hand gratis.</p>
   <p>No affidavit to be necessary for a person dying of the
plague. It imposed a fine of 5l. for every infringement, one
half to go to the informer, and the other half to the poor of
the parish.</p>
   <p>This Act was only repealed by 54 Geo. III. c. 108, or in
the year <date value="1815">1815</date>.</p>
   <p>The material used was flannel, and such interments are
frequently mentioned in the literature of the time, and <persName key="Luttrell,Narcissus">Luttrell</persName>

mentions in his diary (Oct. 9, <date value="1703">1703</date>) that the Irish Parliament
had just brought in bills  'for encouraging the linnen

<p><figure id="fig.7" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00007"><head>INVITATION TO A FUNERAL</head></figure></p>

  <p>Elegies, laudatory of the deceased, were sometimes printed
and sent to friends: these were got up in the same
charnelhouse style. Indeed, no pains were spared to make a funeral
utterly miserable and expensive. Hatbands were costly items.




<pb n="50" id="p.50"/>
 'For the encouragement of our English silk called Alamodes,
His Royal Highness the Prince of Denmark, the Nobility, and
other persons of Quality appear in Mourning Hatbands made
of that Silk, to bring the same in fashion, in the place of Crapes,
which are made in the Pope's Country where we send our
Money for them.'  Gloves, of course, had to be given to every
mourner. Indeed it is refreshing among the universal spoiling
of the deceased's survivors to find that one man advertises
cheap mourning and funeral necessaries.  'For the good of
the Publick, I Edward Evans, at the Four Coffins in the
Strand, over against Somerset House; Furnish all Necessaries
for all sorts of Funerals, both great and small. And all sorts
of set Mourning both Black and Gray and all other Furniture
sutable to it, fit for any person of Quality. Which I promise
to perform 2s. in the Pound cheaper than any of the
Undertakers in Town or elsewhere.' </p>
   <p>Of course these remarks do not apply to the poor: they
had already started burial clubs or societies, and very cheap
they seem to have been.  ' This is to give Notice, that the
Office of Society for Burials, by mutual Contribution of a
Halfpenny or Farthing towards a Burial, erected upon Wapping
Wall, is now removed into Katherine Wheel Alley in White
Chappel, near Justice Smiths, where subscriptions are taken
to compleat the number, as also at the Ram in Crucifix lane
in Barnaby Street, Southwark; to which places notice is to be
given of the death of any Member, and where any Person may
havethe Printed Articles after Monday next. And this Thursday
about 7 o'clock Evening will be Buried by the Undertakers the
Corpse of J. S., a Glover over against the Sun Brewhouse, in
Golden Lane; as also a Child from the Corner of Acorn Alley
in Bishopsgate Street, and another Child from the Great Maze
Pond, Southwark.' </p>
   <p>We see in the invitation to Mr. Newborough's funeral that
it was to take place on an evening in January. This probably
was so arranged by the Undertaker (indeed, the custom was
general) to increase his costs, for then the mourners were
furnished with wax tapers. These were heavy, and
sometimes (judging from the illustrations to undertakers' handbills)
were made of four tapers twisted at the stem and then branching

<pb n="51" id="p.51"/>

out. That these wax candles were expensive enough to
excite the thievish cupidity of a band of roughs the following
advertisement will show:  ' Riots and Robberies. Committed in
and about Stepney Church Yard, at a Funeral Solemnity, on
Wednesday the 23rd day of September; and whereas many
Persons, who being appointed to attend the same Funeral with
white Wax lights of a considerable Value, were assaulted in a
most violent manner, and the said white Wax lights taken
from them. Whoever shall discover any of the Persons, guilty
of the said Crimes, so as they may be convicted of the same,
shall receive of Mr. William Prince, Wax Chandler in the

&amp;c.<note place="foot" n="5"><hi rend="italics">Daily Courant</hi>, Sept. 30, <date value="1713">1713</date>.</note></p>
    <p>We get a curious glimpse of the paraphernalia of a funeral
in the Life of a notorious cheat,  'The German Princess,'  who
lived, and was hanged, in the latter part of the seventeenth
century, and the same funeral customs therein described obtained
in Anne's time. She took a lodging at a house; in a good
position, and told the landlady that a friend of hers, a stranger
to London, had just died, and was lying at  'a pitiful Alehouse,'
and might she, for convenience' sake, bring his corpse there,
ready for burial on the morrow. The landlady consented,
and  'that Evening the Corps in a very handsome Coffin was
brought in a Coach, and plac'd in the Chamber, which was the
Room one pair of Stairs next the street and had a Balcony.
The Coffin being cover'd only with an ordinary black Cloth, our
Counterfeit seems much to dislike it; the Landlady tells her
that for 20s. she might have the Use of a Velvet Pall, with
which being well pleas'd, she desir'd that the Landlady would
send for the Pall, and withal accommodate the Room with her
best Furniture, for the next Day but one he should be bury'd;
thus the Landlady perform'd, getting the Velvet Pall, and
placing on a Side-Board Table 2 Silver Candlesticks, a Silver
Flaggon, 2 Standing gilt Bowls, and several other Pieces of
Plate; but the Night before the intended Burial, our
counterfeit Lady and her Maid within the House, handed to their
Comrades without, all the Plate, Velvet Pall, and other
Furniture of the Chamber that was Portable and of Value, leaving the



<pb n="52 " id="p.52 "/>
Coffin and the suppos'd Corps, she and her Woman descended
from the Balcony by Help of a Ladder, which her Comrades
had brought her.'  It is needless to say that the coffin contained
only brickbats and hay, and a sad sequel to this story is, that
the undertaker sued the landlady for the loss of his pall, which
had lately cost him 40&#x00A3;.</p>
   <p>Another very costly item in funerals was the giving of
mourning rings. We see <note place="foot" n="6">Appendix.</note>the number of rings given at <persName key="Pepys,Samuel">Pepys</persName>'
funeral in <date value="1703">1703</date>, and their value, 20s. and 15s., especially when
we consider the extra value of the currency at that period,
must have been a sore burden to the survivors. <persName key="Thoresby,Ralph">Thoresby</persName> <note place="foot" n="7">Diary of <persName key="Thoresby,Ralph">Ralph Thoresby</persName>, April 15, <date value="1702">1702</date>.</note>
shows to what a prodigal extent this custom might be carried.
 'Afternoon, at the Funeral of my excellent and dear friend,
Dr. Thomas Gale, Dean of York, who was interred with great
solemnity: lay in state, 200 rings (besides scarfs to bearers and
gloves to all) given in the room where I was, which yet could
not contain the company.' </p>
   <p>Naturally, a great many must have come to a man in the
course of his life, as we may see by the contents of a box lost
out of a waggon between Stamford and London:  ' 3 Hair
Rings, 6 with a Death's Head, about 2 penny weight apiece the
Posie (Prepared be to follow me); 3 other mourning rings
with W. C. ob. 18 Dec. <date value="1702">1702</date>; 1 Ennamelled Ring, 3
Pennyweight twelve grains. W. Heltey, ob. 5 July, AEt. 61.'
And their value may be guessed from  'Lost on Thursday, the
8th Instant one of the late Lord Huntingdon's Funeral Rings.
Whoever brings it to Mr. White's at the Chocolate House in
<placeName key="St. James's">St. James's</placeName> shall have two Guineas reward.' </p>
    <p>Besides the rings, hatbands, scarves, and gloves, there was
another tax; for Evelyn,<note place="foot" n="8"><hi rend="italics">Diary</hi>, May 26, <date value="1703">1703</date>.</note>
 noting <persName key="Pepys,Samuel">Pepys</persName>' death and burial, says,
 ' Mr. <persName key="Pepys,Samuel">Pepys</persName> had been for neare 40 years so much my particular
friend that Mr. Jackson sent me compleat mourning, desiring
me to be one to hold up the pall at his magnificent obsequies,
but my indisposition hinder'd me from doing him this last
office.' </p>
    <p>The pomp of funerals was outrageous. <persName key="Gay,John">Gay</persName>, observant as
he always was, notes this in  'Trivia,'  book 3 :-

   <p> But there was one thing they did not spend so much
money upon as their forefathers did, i.e. on monumental


<pb n="54" id="p.54"/>

statuary, &amp;c. In this age the bust, or  'busto,'  was used in
preference to the recumbent, or half-figures, of the previous
century; but by far the greater number of mortuary
memorials took the form of mural tablets, more or less ornate,
according to the taste and wealth of the parties concerned.
As a rule the epitaph was in Latin-this classical age, and
the somewhat pedantic one that followed, could brook no
meaner tongue in which to eulogise its dead; and their
virtues were pompously set forth in that language which is
common to the whole of the civilised world.</p>
    <p>No account of the funerals of this age would be complete
without seeing what <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName> says on the subject :- ' As soon
as any Person is dead, they are oblig'd to give Notice thereof
to the Minister of the Parish, and to those who are appointed
to visit dead Bodies. This Custom of visiting dead Bodies was
establish'd after the dreadful Plague that ravag'd London in
<date value="1665">1665</date>, to the Intent that it might be immediately known if
there was any Contagious Distemper, and proper Methods
taken to put a Stop to it. They are generally two Women
that do this. The Clerk of the Parish receives their
Certificate, and out of these is form'd an Abridgment that is
publish'd every Week. By this Paper you may see how many
Persons of both Sexes dy'd within that Week, of what
Distemper, or by what Accident.</p>
   <p>'There is an Act of Parliament which ordains, That the
Dead shall be bury'd in a Woollen Stuff, which is a Kind of
a thin Bays, which they call Flannel; nor is it lawful to use the
least Needleful of Thread or Silk. (The Intention of this Act
is for the Encouragement of the Woollen Manufacture.) This
Shift is always White; but there are different Sorts of it as to
Fineness, and consequently of different Prices. To make these
Dresses is a particular Trade, and there are many that sell
nothing else; so that these Habits for the Dead are always to
be had ready made, of what Size or Price you please, for
People of every Age and Sex. After they have wash'd the
Body thoroughly clean, and shav'd it, if it be a Man, and his
Beard be grown during his Sickness, they put it on a Flannel
Shirt, which has commonly a Sleeve purfled about the Wrists,
and the Slit of the Shirt down the Breast done in the same
<pb n="55" id="p.55"/>


Manner. When these Ornaments are not of Woollen Lace, they
are at least edg'd, and sometimes embroider'd with black
Thread. The Shirt shou'd be at least half a Foot longer than
the Body, that the Feet of the Deceas'd may be wrapped in it
as in a Bag. When they have thus folded the End of the
Shirt close to the Feet, they tye the Part that is folded down
with a Piece of Woollen Thread, as we do our Stockings; so
that the End of the Shirt is done into a Kind of Tuft.</p>
   <p>'Upon the Head they put a Cap, which they fasten with a
very broad Chin Cloth, with Gloves on the Hands, and a Cravat
round the Neck, all of Woollen. That the Body may ly the
softer, some put a Lay of Bran, about four inches thick, at the
Bottom of the Coffin. Instead of a Cap, the Women have a
Kind of Head Dress, with a Forehead Cloth. The Body being
thus equipp'd and laid in the Coffin (which Coffin is sometimes
very magnificent), it is visited a second time, to see that it is
bury'd in Flannel, and that nothing about it is sowed with
Thread. They let it lye three or four Days in this Condition;
which Time they allow, as well to give the dead Person an
Opportunity of Coming to Life again, if his Soul has not quite
left his Body, as to prepare Mourning, and the Ceremonies of
the Funeral.</p>
   <p>'They send the Beadle with a List of such Friends and
Relations as they have a Mind to invite; and sometimes they
have printed Tickets, which they leave at their Houses. A little
before the Company is set in Order for the March, they lay the
Body into the Coffin upon two Stools, in a Room where all that
please may go and see it; they then take off the Top of the
Coffin, and remove from off the Face a little square Piece of
Flannel, made on Purpose to cover it, and not fastened to any
Thing; Upon this Occasion the rich Equipage of the Dead does
Honour to the Living. The Relations and chief Mourners are
in a Chamber apart, with their more intimate Friends; and the
rest of the Guests are dispersed in several Rooms about the
House.</p>
   <p>'When they are ready to set out, they nail up the Coffin,
and a Servant presents the Company with Sprigs of Rosemary:
Every one takes a Sprig and carries it in his Hand 'till the Body
is put into the Grave, at which Time they all throw their Sprigs

<pb n="56" id="p.56"/>
in after it. Before they set out, and after they return, it is
usual to present the Guests with something to drink, either
<figure id="fig.8" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00008"><head>LYING IN STATE</head></figure>
red or white Wine, boil'd with Sugar and Cinnamon, or some
such Liquor. Butler, the Keeper of a Tavern, <note place="foot" n="10">The Crown and Sceptre in <persName key="St. Martin's Street">St. Martin's Street</persName>.</note> told me there

<pb n="57" id="p.57"/>

was a Tun of Red Port drank at his Wife's Burial, besides
mull'd White Wine. Note, no Men ever go to Women's Burials,
nor the Women to the Men's; so that there were none but
Women at the drinking of Butler's Wine. Such Women in
England will hold it out with the Men, when they have a
Bottle before them, as well as upon t'other Occasion, and
tattle infinitely better than they.</p>
   <p>'The Parish has always three or four Mortuary Cloths of
different Prices, <note place="foot" n="11">The handsomest was let out on hire for twenty-five or thirty shillings.</note>
 to furnish those who are at the Charge of the
interment. These Cloths, which they Call Palls, are some of
black Velvet, others of Cloth with an edge of white Linnen or
Silk, a foot broad, or thereabouts; For a Batchellor or Maid,
or for a Woman that dies in Child Birth, the Pall is white.
This is spread over the Coffin, and is so broad that the Six or
Eight Men that carry the Body are quite hid beneath it to
their Waste, and the Corners and Sides of it hang down low
enough to be born by those <note place="foot" n="12">Called Pall-bearers-some six friends or so-and accounted a special honour.</note>
 who, according to Custom, are
invited for that purpose. They generally give Black or White
Gloves and black Crape Hatbands to those that carry the Pall;
sometimes also white Silk Scarves.</p>
   <p>'Every Thing being ready to move (it must be remember'd
that I always speak of middling People, among whom the
Customs of a Nation are most truly to be learn'd), one or
more Beadles march first, each carrying a long Staff, at the
End of which is a great Apple or Knob of Silver. The Minister
of the Parish, generally accompany'd by some other Minister,
and attended by the Clerk, walks next; and the Body carry'd
as I said before, comes just after him. The Relations in close
Mourning, and all the Guests two and two, make up the rest
of the Procession. The Common Practice is to carry the corpse
thus into the Body of the Church, where they set it down upon
two Tressels, while either a Funeral Sermon is preach'd,
containing an Eulogium upon the deceased, or certain Prayers
said, adapted to the Occasion. If the Body is not bury'd in
the Church, they carry it to the Church Yard belonging to the
same, where it is interr'd in the Presence of the Guests, who
are round the Grave, and they do not leave it 'till the Earth is

<pb n="58" id="p.58"/>

thrown in upon it. Then they return Home in the same
order that they came, and each drinks two or three Glasses
more before he goes Home. Among Persons of Quality 'tis
customary to embalm the Body, and to expose it for a
Fortnight or more on a Bed of State. After which they carry it in
a Sort of a Waggon <note place="foot" n="13">A hearse.</note> made for that Purpose, and cover'd with
black Cloth, to the Place appointed by the Deceased. This
Cart is attended by a long train of Mourning Coaches
belonging to the Friends of the Dead Person.' </p>
   <p>A notice of a Roman Catholic funeral must conclude this
subject. It is taken from the will of  'Mr. Benjamin Dod,
Citizen and Linnen Draper, who fell from his Horse, and dy'd
soon after.' <note place="foot" n="14"><hi rend="italics">The Flying Post and Medley</hi>, July 27, <date value="1714">1714</date>.</note>
  ' I desire Four and Twenty Persons to be at my

   <p>Widows wore black veils, and a somewhat peculiar cap,

<p>ALTHOUGH for the purpose of this work it is necessary to
say somewhat of the houses of the period, it is not worth
while discussing the so-called revival of the architecture of
Queen Anne's time.   The modern houses are quaint and
pretty, but they are innocent of any close connection with
her reign. Artists' and architects' holiday rambles in Holland
are provocative of most of them;  'sweet little bits'  having
been brought home in sketch-books from Dordrecht and
kindred happy hunting-grounds for the picturesque.  The
style was not even adopted for mansions-vide Marlborough
House and Blenheim; and the exterior of the ordinary town
houses, even of the better class, was singularly unpretentious.
Hatton <note place="foot" n="1"><hi rend="italics">A New View of London</hi>, <date value="1708">1708</date>.</note> is struck with admiration of Queen Square (now
Queen Anne's Gate), and says it is  'a beautiful New (tho'
small) Square, of very fine Buildings.'  If he could thus eulogise
its architecture, what must have been the plainness of the
exterior of ordinary houses! It was not that there was a
lack of good architects, for <persName key="Wren,Christopher">Wren</persName> and <persName key="Vanbrugh,John">Vanbrugh</persName> were alive,
but the houses and furniture were in conformity with the
spirit of the times-very dull, and plain, and solid. We must
never forget that during nearly the whole of this queen's
reign a cruel war exhausted the people's finances, that trade
was circumscribed, and that there were no mushroom parvenus,


<pb n="61" id="p.61"/>


with inflated fortunes made from shoddy or the Stock
Exchange, to spend their wealth lavishly on architecture or
art in any shape.</p>
   <p>A dull mediocrity in thought and feeling prevailed, and if
any originality in architecture was attempted, it would
certainly have been satirised, as it was in the very little-known
poem of  'The History of <persName key="Vanbrugh,John">Vanbrugh</persName>'s House.'

    <p>But should any reader wish to see good specimens of real
Queen Anne's houses, I would recommend a visit to Nos.
10 and 11 Austinfriars.  They are undoubtedly genuine
(mark the date <date value="1704">1704</date> on the waterspout); and the staircase
of No. 10, with its beautifully turned and carved balusters,
and boldly yet easily carved soffits, is a real treat to see; and
were it to be cleansed from its many coats of paint, and
appear in its original state, it would be an almost matchless
specimen of the domestic building of the time. The ceiling,
too, at the top of the staircase is very beautifully painted,
and was most probably the work either of <persName key="Laguerre,Louis">Laguerre</persName> or
<persName key="Thornhill,James">Thornhill</persName>. It is good enough for either of them. No. 11 is inferior
to No. 10, but were its neighbour away it would be looked
upon as a very good type of a house in the reign of Queen
Anne. See also an old house, now used as a Board school,
formerly the residence of <persName key="Wren,Christopher">Sir C. Wren</persName>, in a courtyard in
<placeName key="Water Lane">Water Lane</placeName>, <placeName key="Eastcheap">Eastcheap</placeName>.</p>
    <p>But a good plan is to judge of the houses by contemporary
evidence and description.  ' To be Let, a New Brick House,
Built after the Newest Fashion, the Rooms wainscotted and
Painted, Lofty Stories, Marble Foot paces to the Chimneys,
Sash Windows, glaised with fine Crown Glass, large half Pace
Stairs, that 2 People may go up on a Breast, in a new
pleasant Court planted with Vines, Jesamin, and other Greens,
next Door to the Crown near the Sarazen's Head Inn in


<pb n="63" id="p.63"/>

Carter Lane, near <placeName key="St. Paul's Church Yard">St. Paul's Church Yard</placeName>, London.'  So we
see even as late as <date value="1710">1710</date> that a staircase capable of
accommodating two people abreast was a novelty, only to be found
in  'the last thing out'  in houses. The windows of these
houses were long but narrow; the smallness of the panes
being rendered necessary by the fact that no large size could
be made in window-glass, it being only of late years that the
manufacture has improved to that extent. Here is another
house described, temp. <date value="1712">1712</date>.  ' To be Lett, near <placeName key="Cheapside">Cheapside</placeName>, A
large new-built House that fronts two Streets of great Trade:
The Shop is lined with Deal all round, and is about 60 Foot
deep one way. There is under the Shop a very good dry

it, the Sides and Top is lined with Deal, it is 9 foot between
Floor and Top. There is above Stairs 4 Rooms on a Floor,
almost all Wainscotted, and a large Staircase all Wainscotted.
All the Flat is covered with very thick Lead, with Rails and
Bannisters round the Leads and a large Cupolo on the Top.
Inquire of Mr. Richard Wright at the Perriwig in Bread
Street.' </p>
   <p>This must have been an extra good house, for they were
mostly roofed with tiles, a fact which has practical
demonstration, for after the terrible storm of Nov. 26, <date value="1703">1703</date>, which
damaged London alone to the extent of a million sterling, and
cost us many men-of-war, the loss of over 1,500 sailors of the
navy, and an unnumbered quantity of merchant seamen,
the price of tiles rose tremendously. On Dec. 7  'there is
to be sold Plain Tiles 50s. a Thousand, and Pan Tiles for 6l.
a Thousand.'  The plain tiles went still higher, for on Dec. 24
they were 65s. a thousand.</p>
   <p>As a rule the rooms were fairly lofty, and the walls of the
better class were mostly wainscotted with oak, walnut,
chestnut, or cedar, and sometimes beautifully carved, and in the
lower-class houses with deal, painted. But wall papers were
coming in. <note place="foot" n="5"><hi rend="italics">Postman</hi>, December 10/12, <date value="1702">1702</date>.</note>  ' At the Blue Paper Warehouse in

advertised  'Three Suites of Hanging: one of Forrest Tapistry,
one of clouded Camlet, and one of blue Printed Linsey; the
2 first very good, scarce the worse for wearing--to be sold
very reasonable.' </p>
   <p>Stained glass was not used, generally, for decorative
purposes, save for coats of arms; indeed, the art seems to
have been in a bad way, judging from the following
advertisement:<note place="foot" n="6"><hi rend="italics">The London Gazette</hi>, June 14/18, <date value="1705">1705</date>.
</note>  ' Whereas the ancient Art of Painting and Staining

   <p>Houses were not always let by Agreement, but the leases
were sold; and it is by means of such advertisements that we
are able to get at the rents, which seem to have been very low
-even reckoning the difference of value in money. Certainly
they had none of our modern appliances and conveniences,
which add so considerably to the cost of buildings, nor do
they seem to have been saddled with exorbitant ground rents.

<pb n="65" id="p.65"/>


 'To be sold a lease of 33 years to come in 5 Houses standing
together on the North side of the Pall Mall, whereon 25l. per
Ann. Rent is reserved. The Houses are let at 200l. a year.'   ' A
Gentleman has occasion for a lightsome fashionable House in
some Genteel part of the Town, or very nigh the Town, and
if accommodated with Coach House and Stables it will be
better lik'd, of about 30l., 40l., or 50l. a year Rent.' </p>
    <p>A little way out of town rents were even cheaper than
this. Here would be a boon for rowing men.  'To be let at
Barns adjoyning to Mortlack, fronting the River <placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName>, is
a convenient little New House, 2 rooms on a floor, so well
situated that it may be shut up, and the Furniture Safe. The
benefit of the air may be had at pleasure, for 6l. 10s. per Ann.'
 ' Also another House for more private Dwelling, well
accommodated with a Garden, River Water, etc., well situated for a
Gentleman belonging to the Custom, East India, or African
House, or Navy or Victualling Office, and the rent but 10l.
per Annum. Also a Brick House in the Country, 2 Miles off,
standing pleasantly in a good Air, and but 5l. per Annum to
be Lett.'  These instances clearly prove that house rent was

</note> he  'was

demand of 4s. per week for my lodgings ;'  but then that
could only have been a bedroom, for the old gentleman was

   <p>It is needless to say that there was more danger of fire
then than now; and the inhabitants of London, very many
of whom must have had a vivid remembrance of that awful



<pb n="66" id="p.66"/>

fire in <date value="1666">1666</date>, were not altogether neglectful of their interests
in this matter. In <date value="1710">1710</date> an Act was passed amending an Act
made in the sixth year of Anne's reign, ' for the better
preventing of Mischiefs that may happen by Fire.'  This Act
dealt with parochial fire-engines, rewards, rates for water
supply and maintenance of same, the thickness of party walls,'
etc., and contained one very useful little clause.  'It is further
enacted, That there shall be left at the House, upon which
there is a Notice of a Fire Plug, a Key to open the Stop Cock,
and also a Pipe for the Water to come thereout, to be made
use of as Occasion shall require.' </p>
   <p>They were also fully alive to the necessity of keeping
lifesaving appliances in their houses.  'This is to give Notice,
That the Rope Ladders and other Ropes, so useful for
preserving whole Families from the dismal Accidents of Fire, are
to be sold,'  etc.</p>
   <p>There were three fire insurance companies, whose leaden
badges used to be nailed on to the houses, to show they were
insured, and in what office; and a reward was offered by the
<orgName key="Friendly Society">Friendly Society</orgName> on July 14, <date value="1705">1705</date>, for the discovery of persons
who had stolen some of them.</p>
   <p>These three insurance companies were: first, <orgName key="the Phoenix">the Phoenix</orgName>,

also by the <placeName key="Royal Exchange">Royal Exchange</placeName>, established about the year <date value="1682">1682</date>,
and the assurers in <date value="1710">1710</date> numbered about 10,000.  The
system was to pay 30s. down, and insure 100l. for seven
years. Second, the <orgName key="Friendly Society">Friendly Society</orgName>, in Palsgrave Court,
without <placeName key="Temple Bar">Temple Bar</placeName>, which was the first (in <date value="1684">1684</date>) that insured

seven years by paying 6s. 8d. down, and an annual
subscription of 1s. 4d. In <date value="1710">1710</date> the number of assured was 18,000.

House in <persName key="St. Martin's Lane">St. Martin's Lane</persName> Lane (commenced about <date value="1695">1695</date>). Here
a payment of 12s. would insure 100l. for seven years, at the
expiration of which time 10s. would be returned to the
assured--who in <date value="1710">1710</date> numbered over 13,000. This society
seems to have changed its name to the Hand-in-Hand Fire
Office, who gave up their two establishments at Tom's Coffee
House and the Crown Coffee House, behind the Exchange,

<pb n="67" id="p.67"/>

for more suitable premises in Angel Court, Snow Hill, and
notified the change in the <hi rend="italics">Gazette</hi> of Jan. 1, <date value="1714">1714</date>.</p>
   <p>All these employed several men in liveries, and with badges

        <quote rend="blockquote">But hark ! Distress with Screaming Voice draws nigh'r,
        And wakes the slumb'ring Street with Cries of Fire.
        At first a glowing Red enwraps the Skies,
        And borne by Winds the scatt'ring Sparks arise;
        From Beam to Beam, the fierce Contagion spreads;
        The Spiry Flames now lift aloft their Heads,
        Through the burst Sash a blazing Deluge pours,

        Now with thick Crouds th' enlighten'd Pavement swarms,
        The Fire-man sweats beneath his crooked Arms,
        A leathern Casque his vent'rous Head defends,
        Boldly he climbs where thickest Smoak ascends;
        Mov'd by the Mother's streaming Eyes and Pray'rs,
        The helpless Infant through the Flame he bears;
        With no less Virtue, than through hostile Fire,
        The Dardan Hero bore his aged Sire.
        See forceful Engines spout their levell'd Streams,
        To quench the Blaze that runs along the Beams;
        The grappling Hook plucks Rafters from the Walls,
        And Heaps on Heaps the smoaky Ruine falls.
        Blown by strong Winds the fiery Tempest roars,
        Bears down new Walls, and pours along the Floors:
        The Heav'ns are all a blaze, the Face of Night
        Is cover'd with a sanguine dreadful Light.

       The shatter'd Pile sinks on the smoaky Ground. </quote></p>
   <p>The sanitary arrangements of these houses were very
defective, and the streets at night time must have been
anything but pleasant walks.</p>
   <p> ' We had not walk'd the usual distance between a Church

                           not good. Old-fashioned wells
                           and pumps, sunk in a crowded
                           city full of cesspools and
graveyards, could not have furnished
                           a healthy supply.  Of course
                           there was the water brought by
                           the city from <placeName key="Highgate">Highgate</placeName> and

                           inhabitants, or it would not have
                           been hawked about.</p>
   <p>More was furnished by the <placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName> Water Works by means
of a huge water-wheel, which worked many force-pumps,
and which was erected by a Dutchman named Peter Morrice,
in <date value="1582">1582</date>. This occupied a position on the old bridge, similar
to its being placed close to the stairs by <placeName key="Fishmongers' Hall">Fishmongers' Hall</placeName>
at the present time. Although the river was infinitely purer
than at present, yet, being tidal, and the supply being taken
from in shore, it could not have been good for drinking
purposes. There was a new company formed to work this
machine, and in the <hi rend="italics">London Gazette</hi>, Oct. 28/Nov. 1, <date value="1703">1703</date>,
is an advertisement:  'This is to give Notice to such Persons

as have subscribed for Shares in the <placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName> Water, That the

   <p>Hatton says in his  'New View of London'  that  'besides
the old work erected by Mr. Morris, the New placed in
the 4th Arch of the Bridge consists of 2 Wheels with 7
Engines set up about the Year <date value="1702">1702</date>, so there are in all
13 Engines.</p>
   <p>'They are the contrivance of that great English Engineer
Mr. Sorocold, whereby the <placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName> Water is raised from the N.
end of the Bridge to a very great altitude, by which means
many parts of the City &amp;c. are served with the <placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName>
Water. The Flux and Reflux of the Water worketh the
Engine. Here are several Proprietors who serve Houses for
the most part at 20s. per Ann. paid quarterly, and they have
proportionately more from Brewhouses, &amp;c., according to what
they Consume. To this Company also belongs the Works at
Broken Wharf and the City Conduit Water.</p>
   <p>'The Old Stock was 500 Shares, and valued at 500l. a
Share, since which those Shares were divided into <date value="1500">1500</date> Shares,
each valued at about 100l. per Share. They pay the City
700l. per Ann. for the Conduit Water, and about 10l. per
Ann. for the Bridge; Also 300l. to Sir Benj. Ayloff or his
Assignees for the Broken Wharf, to which place 2 of the
Engines at the Bridge do Work, and there are also at that
Wharf 2 Horse Works.</p>
    <p>'They chiefly serve Goodman's Fields, Minories,
Houndsditch, White Chapel, and Birchin Lane.
    'Merchant's Water Works are in Harts Horn Lane. <note place="foot" n="11">Afterwards Northumberland Street, Strand.</note> He

Income is divided into 8 Shares. Rates are at least 10s.
per Ann., but commonly 20s., and for Brewers and
extraordinary Occasions more than so many Pounds.' </p>
   <p>The water was supplied in primitive pipes of wood, some
being of the very small bore of one inch.  'The Governor
and Company of the New River, being inclined to contract
for Wooden Pipes of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 Inches Diameter
in the Bore, to be delivered at any Place within the

   <p>An adventurer's share in the New River Water Company
was then worth <date value="4500">4500</date> guineas; and Hatton, in his  'New View
of London,'  says:  'They now Let the Water to most Houses
without Fine or Lease, according as they Consume Water, to
none less than 22s. 8d. per Ann., but to some Brewers, &amp;c.,
for 40l. per Ann., which, and all common Cocks, they Let by
Lease and Fine.' </p>
   <p>The river was scoured out twice a year, and a staff was
kept of  '12 Walkers between Ware and London (who
daily take care that no Infectious or other thing be thrown
into the River that might in any way prejudice it, whereby
it is kept Sweet and Wholesome).' </p>
    <p>The following advertisement appears in the London
Gazette, April 20/May 3, <date value="1703">1703</date> : ' The Governor and Company
of the New River brought from Chadwell and Amwell to
London, having from time to time made several Orders and
Regulations for the Ease and Benefit of those who make use
of their Water; but being informed, that several
Misrepresentations are Industriously spread abroad to their Prejudice,
they have thought fit to publish the following Orders, which
have been made from time to time since at several Courts.
Viz:</p>
   <p> '<hi rend="italics">Ordered</hi>. That no Private Family that is served with the
Water of the New River, shall be required to take a Lease
of the said Water; but that what Rent shall be agreed on with

the Collectors to be paid, shall be received by them without
the Charge of a Lease.
   'Whereas Strict Charge hath been given to the Collectors,
and all other Officers of the said New River, That they behave
themselves Civilly and Respectfully to such as use the said
Water: If any do otherwise
   '<hi rend="italics">Ordered</hi>. That upon any Complaints to the Meetings of
the Company every Thursday at Three in the Afternoon, at
their Office at Puddle Dock, Reparation shall forthwith be
made to the Party grieved.
   ' <hi rend="italics">Ordered</hi>. That. any Tenant may employ their own
Plummer to do their Work in mending, or laying any Branch,
such Plummer first acquainting the Collector, and making use
of the Company's Paviour of that Walk to dig the same.' </p>
   <p>The leaden cisterns for holding the family supply were
often very artistically and elaborately ornamented, either with
flowers or classical subjects, and are nearly all dated. The
few now spared in London are of course extremely curious,
as being exemplars of the art manufactures of the time.</p>
   <p>The houses were principally heated by coals, except in the
bedrooms, and, coals being all sea-borne, prices were
sometimes very high; thus, latter end of April <date value="1702">1702</date>- ' Coals are
at 33s. per Chaldron in the Pool, because of the great Impress.
No Ships are to sail till the Fleet is compleatly mann'd.'
Besides this, there was a tax of 2s. per chaldron,  'to be applyed
towards finishing <placeName key="St. Paul's">St. Paul's</placeName> Cathedrall,'  which was, on Nov. 26,
<date value="1702">1702</date>, ordered to be continued till after the year <date value="1708">1708</date>. <note place="foot" n="13"><hi rend="italics"><persName key="Luttrell,Narcissus">Luttrell</persName>'s Diary</hi>, Nov. 26, <date value="1702">1702</date>.</note>  This
high price was partly fictitious, a  'ring'  having been formed
in coals; but they managed those things better then than
now, and held public inquiry on  'forestallers and regraters.'  <note place="foot" n="14"><hi rend="italics">Ibid</hi>. Nov. 13, <date value="1703">1703</date>.</note>
 'The lords ordered several persons to attend upon account of
engrossing Coals, and among them two noted quakers; 'tis
said the chief reason of their being so dear is, that several
persons in the north, and some Londoners, have farmed most
of the Coal pits about <placeName key="Newcastle">Newcastle</placeName>, with design to sell them at
what price they please.'  It was even suggested that
Government should take the matter up.  ''Tis said a proposal is
made to the parliament, that the queen be the free importer


<pb n="72" id="p.72"/>

of Coals, and that they shal never exceed 25s. per Chaldron,

   <p>Not only were they dear, but at times poor in quality.
 'The late Common Practice at <placeName key="Sunderland">Sunderland</placeName> of mixing bad sorts
of Coals with the right Lumley Coals, giving such Mixtures
the Name of pure Lumley Coals,' &amp;c., was counteracted by
certificates being given of their genuineness. In Oct. <date value="1711">1711</date>
coals in the Pool were 25s. to 26s. a chaldron.  Scotch coals
had, however, been introduced, for we find an advertisement:
 'At Mr. Folley's Warehouse on White Fryers Wharf, are a
parcel of Scotch Coals to be Sold Reasonably, being the
                         best that have come to London
                         for many Years, and out of the

                         of  'Small coale !'  was heard in the
                         streets-a cry that will always be
                         associated with the memory of

   <p>The stoves used to burn coal were small and portable,
taking the place of the old andirons, and standing unfixed
in the somewhat wide chimney-pieces. It is needless to say
that the modern <soCalled>'Queen Anne'</soCalled> stoves bear very little likeness
to the genuine article. The back plates were frequently very
ornamental, sometimes having the arms of the owner of the
house upon them. The accompanying illustration, being taken
from an ironmonger's handbill, is probably copied from one he
had in stock-if not, it most certainly represented those in use.

<p>
   Of the furniture of the time-the houses were, to our
idea, very scantily furnished. Take any of the very few
engravings of social life in this reign, and one is astonished
at the bare look of the apartments: a table in the centre,
a few high-backed and clumsy chairs, a square, box-like
settee, are all that are movable; on the walls a picture or
two, sometimes, not always, a looking-glass, occasionally an
alcove with shelves for china and bric-a-brac, and window
curtains-always curtains,-the possession of which must
have entailed much trouble on many housekeepers. <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="LA">Vide</foreign></hi>

Hands in and rob the Houses of their Window Curtains.' </hi></p>
   <p>Without doubt, the houses of the wealthy were better
furnished, and more artistically. The virtuoso would bring with
him on his return from his  'grand tour'  some specimens, both
of pictures and furniture, of the lands he visited. Of the
former, they were invariably originals or copies of the Caracci,
Titian, Palma, Van Dyck, etc., and they were always being
imported or changing hands; but of good furniture we seldom
find any to be sold, such as, for instance,  'Two Cabinets, the
one of 48 drawers, containing great variety of curious Shells,
Agates, Corals, Mocus's'  (the Mocha or Moco Stone),  'Medals,
Minerals, and other Rarities. The other finely inlaid with
Flowers and Birds of Stone by Baptist.' </p>
   <p>And the merchants and well-to-do people undoubtedly
had furniture almost invented to show off their china<note place="foot" n="18"><hi rend="italics">Harl.</hi> <date value="5996">5996</date>, 147.</note>:

Corner Cupboards or Sprigs, where it usually stands for

   <p>Naturally, almost all the ornamental ceramics came from
China or Japan-for the state of our own ceramic art was at a
very low ebb; in fact, it was only in its infancy in the middle
of the last century. Some pottery was made in Staffordshire
and York, but it was near London that the manufacture of the
best, such as it was, was seated. The potteries at Fulham
were at work, as also Lambeth and Vauxhall. <persName key="Thoresby,Ralph">Thoresby</persName> tells

beautiful, and of different colours when baked.' </p>
    <p>None of these wares were remarkable at that time for their
beauty, and so the oriental porcelain was naturally the most


<pb n="75" id="p.75"/>



admired, and consequently bore away the palm, both for
beauty of form and design. The use of tea, too, largely helped
the consumption of oriental China. The cups and teapots
were home articles for the Chinese to make, and it was very
many years before we, in England, were even nearly rivalling
them.</p>
   <p>Tea necessitated a smaller and more elegant table, so we
find the want supplied by tea and Dutch tables. Lacquer
ware was also in much request, as well for  ' Tea Tables, Bowls,
Dressing Suites, Cabinets, and
Bellows Boards,'  as for screens
to keep off draughts.</p>                  <p><figure id="fig.14" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00014"><head>A BED.</head></figure></p>

<p>THE quantity of servants in vogue at that time, especially of
male servants, seems to us to be excessive, but when we look
how useful they were, apart from their menial duties, as guards,
and assistants when the carriage stuck in a deep rut when
travelling, and remember that the old feudal system of having
retainers about one for show was then only moribund (it is
not yet dead), their number is accounted for. First on the
list stands my lord's page, who wore his livery, although of
more costly material than that worn by the footman. He
served his apprenticeship as  'a little foot page,'  but it was
always understood that, afterwards, his rise in life should be
looked to by his patron. It was very much the same relation
that existed between knight and squire. How he
accompanied his lord on state occasions is shown in one of the
illustrations of carriages. <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName> speaks disparagingly of the
lad's position.<note place="foot" n="1"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, 214.</note>  ' I know a Man of good Sense who put his
Son to a Blacksmith, tho' an Offer was made him of his being
received a Page to a Man of Quality.' </p>
   <p>But it was the footman of that age, and indeed of the
whole of the early Georgian era, who was the perpetual butt
of the satirist-probably not without reason.  'There's nothing
we Beaus take more Pride in than a Sett of Genteel Footmen.
I never have any but what wear their own Hair, and I allow
em a Crown a Week for Gloves and Powder; if one shouldn't,
they'd Steal horridly to set themselves out, for now, not one in

<pb n="77" id="p.77"/>



ten is without a Watch, and a nice Snuff Box with the best
Orangerie; and the Liberty of the Upper Gallery, has made
'em so confounded pert, that, as they wait behind one at Table,
they'll either put in their Word, or Mimick a body, and People
must bear with 'em or else pay 'em their Wages.' <note place="foot" n="2"><hi rend="italics">Tunbridge Walks</hi>, ed. <date value="1703">1703</date>.</note>
  <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>, of
course, could not resist such a tempting theme for his pen,
and, consequently, devotes a whole <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> (No. 88) to
footmen. He says:  'They are but in a lower Degree what
their Masters themselves are ; and usually affect an Imitation
of their Manners; and you have in Liveries, Beaux, Fops, and
Coxcombs, in as high perfection, as among People that keep
Equipages. It is a common Humour among the Retinue of
People of Quality, when they are in their Revels, that is when
they are out of their Master's Sight, to assume in a humourous
Way the Names and Titles of those whose Liveries they wear.' </p>
    <p>Indeed, the footmen of that age must have had a good
time of it, for the custom of feeing them, or, as it was called,
of giving them <soCalled>'vails,'</soCalled> was very prevalent. It got worse later
on-indeed, it became such a nuisance that it was obliged to be
stopped. Yet even now it has to be done, like feeing waiters.
Certainly their wages were not great.  'I love punctual
Dealings, Sir; Now my Wages comes to at Six Pound per
Annum, Thirty two Pounds the Five Years and four Months,
the odd Week two Shillings Sixpence, the two Hours one
halfpenny,'  etc.<note place="foot" n="3"><hi rend="italics">The Perplexed Lovers</hi>, by <persName key="Centlivre,Susannah">Mrs. Centlivre</persName>, ed. <date value="1712">1712</date>.</note>
 This, certainly, even at the then enhanced value of
money, was not a great yearly wage, and to a certain extent
must plead excuse for the custom of giving vails. As a rule
they were treated like dogs by their masters, and were caned
mercilessly for very trivial faults. They were very far from
being faultless, and <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName>'s man Patrick seems to have been a
specimen of his kind. How humorously <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> used to describe
his faults to Stella! how he was always going to get rid of
him, and never did!</p>
    <p>Their liveries were, perhaps, not so gorgeous as in the later
Georgian time, but they liked fine clothes.  'Her footmen, as
I told you before, are such Beaus, that I do not much care for
asking them Questions; when I do, they answer me with a
sawcy Frown, and say that every thing, which I find fault with,

<pb n="78" id="p.78"/>

was done by my Lady Mary's Order. She tells me that she
intends they shall wear Swords with their next Liveries, having
lately observed the Footmen of two or three Persons of Quality
hanging behind the Coach with Swords by their Sides.' <note place="foot" n="4"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 299.</note></p>
   <p>One part of their duty was to call on their master's or
mistress's acquaintances, and ask, with their compliments,
 ' How do ye ? ' --equivalent to our sending in a card; and this
custom is frequently mentioned in contemporary literature.

   <p>The upper gallery at the play was theirs by prescriptive
right; their verdict greatly influenced the success or failure of
a play, and they were worth conciliating. <persName key="Pinkethman,William">Pinkethman</persName>, who
played to the gallery, knew this, and in <persName key="Centlivre,Susannah">Mrs. Centlivre</persName>'s comedy
of ' The Basset Table,'  where he took a footman's part, spoke
the prologue, in which he not only addressed them in preference
to the other portion of the audience, but showed his power
over them by making them rattle their sticks and clap their
hands at his command.

   <p>Whilst waiting in the House of Commons, as alluded to
in the foregoing, the footmen used to form a parliament of
their own, and discussed politics like their masters. As a
joke upon the poverty of the Scotch lords, it used to be said
that, in the footmen's House of Lords, many questions were
lost to the court party, which were carried in the real House,
owing to there being so few footmen belonging to them.
<persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> alludes to this practice <note place="foot" n="7"><hi rend="italics">Journal to Stella</hi>, letter 10.  </note>
 :  ' Pompey, Colonel Hill's black,
designs to stand speaker for the footmen. I am engaged to
use my interest for him, and have spoken to Patrick to get
him some votes.' </p>
   <p> 'Give you a lucky Hit'  shows that the spirit of Chawles
Jeames Yellow Plush was then in existence, and that he
sometimes speculated; and, if the following newspaper paragraph is
reliable, he sometimes won: and would be in a position to
realise the last line in the prologue:  'The Ticket which
entitled the Bearer to 10,000l. drawn in this present Lottery,
belongs to a Brewer's Man and Maid Servant.'  <note place="foot" n="8"><hi rend="italics">Postboy</hi>, Jan. 21/23, <date value="1714">1714</date>.</note>
</p>
   <p>The accomplishments of male servants seem to have been
varied. <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName> says,
<note place="foot" n="9"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 45.</note>
 'I remember the time when some of
our well-bred Country Women kept their Valet de Chambre,
because, forsooth, a Man was much more handy about them
than one of their own Sex. I myself have seen one of these
Male Abigails tripping about the Room with a looking glass
in his Hand, and combing his Lady's Hair a whole Morning
together.'  And another of the fraternity advertises thus:  'A
likely sober Person, who can give a very good Account of
himself, by several Gentlemen and others: He has a Mind to
serve a Gentleman as a Valet de Chambre or Buttler; or to
wait on a single Gentleman in Town or Country; he is known to
shave well, and can make Wigs; he well understands the
Practice of Surgery, which may be of great Use to a Family in the
Country or elsewhere; he is a Sportsman; he understands
shooting flying, Hunting and Fishing, and all other Sports
relating thereunto; he well understands a Horse.' </p>
    <p>But (and it is a curious little revelation of social life) men
did not monopolise the position of body servants to their

<pb n="80" id="p.80"/>

masters. <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>, writing as Isaac Bickerstaff, about his club,
says <note place="foot" n="10">The <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, No. 132.</note>
:  'This may suffice to give the world a taste of our
innocent conversation, which we spun out until about ten
of the clock, when my maid came with a lantern to light
me home.' </p>
    <p>There was, however, another class of servants-black
slaves; for the children of Ham were still in their cruel
bondage here-and many are the advertisements respecting
them, from  'a parcel of beads for the Guinea trade'  to a
 'Mulatto Maid missing.'  It seems curious to us, now, to think
of the somewhat inconsequent behaviour of those times,
keeping black slaves with one hand, and redeeming white ones
from Barbary with the other. One thing is, the poor whites
only changed their method of slavery, for they were draughted
into the navy, and in the long war that followed, there was very
little hope of their release. The papers of March 10, <date value="1702">1702</date>,
tell of 143 out of 190 of these poor wretches going to St.
Paul's, where the Bishop of London gave them 70l. between
them, and the dean, Dr. Sherlock,  'admonished them to return
thanks to the Government for their Deliverance, and to the
People for their Charity, and that they should not pursue the
Practices to which Sailers, &amp;c., are too much addicted, viz.
Swearing and Cursing. There are about 42 left behind, as
'tis said because some of the Powder, which was carried thither,
happened not to be Proof.'  And the London Post, March
11 / 13, tells a touching little romance of this event:  'This day
the Slaves lately arrived from Barbary, went in a Body to the
Admiralty Office, in order to enter themselves on Board the
Queen's Ships; And 'twas observable, that when they came
Yesterday out of Paul's, one of them was spy'd out by 2 of
his Daughters who came thither only out of Curiosity, and so
soon as they saw their Father, run with open Arms, imbraced
and kissed him.' </p>
   <p>It is needless to say that the negro slaves were always
running away, and being advertised for; but, as the rewards
given were not high, it is probable that recapture was almost
certain. One or two instances will suffice:  'A Slender middle
sized India Black, in a dark grey Livery with Brass Buttons,

<pb n="81" id="p.81"/>


went from Mrs. Thwaits, in Stepney, the 4th of June, and is,
suppos'd to be gone on board some Ship in the Downs;
whosoever secures and gives notice of him to Mrs. Thwaits or
Mr. Tresham, two doors within Aldgate, shall have 10s. reward
and reasonable Charges. '  'Went away from his Master's House
in <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName>, upon Monday the 6th Instant, and has since
been seen at <placeName key="Hampstead">Hampstead</placeName>, <placeName key="Highgate">Highgate</placeName> and Tottenham Court, an
Indian Black boy, with long Hair, about 15 Years of Age,
speaks very good English; he went away in a brown Fustian
Frock, a blew Wastecoate, and scarlet Shag Breeches, and is
called by the name of Morat; Whoever brings him to, or gives
Notice of him, so as he may be brought to Mr. Pain's House in
Prince's Court, <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, shall have a Guinea Reward, and
the Boy shall be kindly received.'  Judging by his  'long Hair,'
this boy was not a negro-indeed it would seem that it only
needed a dark skin to constitute a slave; for  'an East India
young man, named Caesar,'  ran away. ' A Negro Maid, aged
about 16 Years, much pitted with the Small Pox, speaks
English well, having a piece of her left Ear bit off by a Dog;
She hath on a strip'd Stuff Wastcoat and Petticoat . . . they
shall have a Guinea Reward and reasonable Charges.'
Sometimes (indeed it was rather fashionable) the poor wretches
had collars round their necks.  'A Tall Negro young fellow
commonly known as Jack Chelsea, having a Collar about his
Neck (unless it be lately filed off), with these Words; Mr.
Moses Goodyeare of <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> his Negro, ran away from his
Master last Tuesday evening.'  This habit of wearing collars
is noticed by <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>, <note place="foot" n="11"><hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, No. 245.</note>
 who inserts a letter from  'a blackamoor
boy-Pompey.'   ' Besides this, the shock dog has a collar
that cost almost as much as mine.'  Sometimes these collars
were of silver.  'Run away from his Master about a Fortnight
since, a lusty Negroe Boy about 18 years of Age, full of pock
holes, had a Silver Collar about his Neck engrav'd Capt. Tho.
Mitchel's Negroe, living in Griffith Street in Shadwel.' </p>
   <p>They were rarely advertised to be sold-indeed, I have
only found one instance in all the newspapers of the twelve
years of Anne's reign, and that is very simple.  'A Negro
boy about 12 years of age, that speaks English, is to be sold.



<pb n="82" id="p.82"/>

Enquire of Mr. Step Rayner, a Watchmaker, at the sign of
the Dial, without Bishopsgate.' </p>
   <p>Another kind of servant must not be forgotten, although
his servitude was but a limited one-and that is the
apprentice, of whom <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName> says:  ' An Apprentice is a sort of a
Slave; he wears neither Hat nor Cap in his Master's presence;
he can't marry, nor lave any Dealings on his own Account.
All he earns is his Masters.'  <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName> is slightly in error in
one part of this description, but it is a piece of delicate etiquette,
which probably escaped a foreigner's eye: the apprentice
might wear his cap in his master's presence during the last
year of his time. A branch of industry then
existedalthough probably it was practised by very few:- 'Attendance
will be given at the Sun Coffee House in Queen Street, very
near <placeName key="Cheapside">Cheapside</placeName>, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, where
Youth may be furnished with Masters to go Apprentices to
Merchants, Wholesale or Retale Trades, or Handicraft Trades.'

<p>PASSING to the social habits of the people, it is difficult where
to commence the description. The men of the time were
humdrum and prosaic-they went nowhere, at least
according to our ideas-a journey to York, or so, was really fraught
with peril and hardship, consequently no one ever moved
about unless they were compelled. The suburbs were sparsely
inhabited, and there was nothing much to see when one got
there, except at <placeName key="Hampstead">Hampstead</placeName> or <placeName key="Highgate">Highgate</placeName>.  'Your Glass
Coach will go to Hide Park for Air. The Suburb fools trudge
to Lambs Conduit or Totnam; your sprucer sort of citizen

much conjugal affection, strut before their wives, each with a

preserv'd bright in a Box of Cotton, and dazzled in the eyes
of each beholder like a piece of Looking glass; their Wastes
hoop'd round with Turkey Leather Belts, at which hung a
Bagonet, or short Scymitar, in order to cut their Mistresses
Names upon the trees of the Forest: In the right Hand a
Whip, mounted against the Breast like the Scepter of a King's
Statue upon the Change, adorn'd with twisted Wiggs and
crown'd with edg'd Casters; being all over in such Prim and
Order, that you could scarce distinguish them from
Gentlemen. Amongst 'em were many Ladies of the same Quality,
ty'd up in Safeguards so be-knotted with their two penny
Taffaty, that a Man might guess by their Finery, their Fathers
to be Ribbond Weavers. We crowded along, mix'd among
the Herd, and could not but fancy the major part of the
Citizens were Scampering out of town to avoid the Horse
Plague. We mov'd forward, without any discontinuance of
our Perambulation, till we came to the Globe at Mile End,
where a Pretious Mortal made us a Short hand complement,
and gave us an Invitation to a Sir-Loine of Roast Beef, out
of which Corroborating Food we renew'd our Lives; and
strengthening our Spirits with a Flask of rare Claret, took
leave of my Friend's Acquaintance and so proceeded.</p>
   <p>'By this time the Road was full of Passengers, every one
furnish'd with no small Appetite to Veal and Bacon. Citizens
in Crowds, upon Pads, Hackneys, and Hunters; all upon the
Tittup, as if he who Rid not a Gallop was to forfeit his Horse.
Some Spurring on with that speed and chearfulness, as if they
intended never to come back again: Some Double, and some
Single. Every now and then drop'd a Lady from her Pillion,
another from her Side Saddle; Sometimes a Beau would
tumble and dawb his Boots, which, to shew his Neatness, he
would clean with his Handkerchief. In this order did we
March, like Aaron's Proselites, to Worship the Calf, till we
came to the New rais'd Fabrick call'd Mob's Hole, where the
Beast was to be Eaten. We press'd hard to get into the
House, which we found so full, that when I was in, what with
the smell of Sweat, Stinking Breaths and Tobacco, I thought
there was but a few Gasps between the Place and Eternity.
Some were Dancing to a Bag pipe; others Whistling to a Base

liquid refreshment, they chatted and bantered with the holiday
folk, until  ' from thence went into the Kitchin, Built up of
Furzes, in the Open Air, to behold their Cookery; where the
Major part of the Calf was Roasting upon a Wooden Spit: Two
or three great Slivers he had lost off his Buttocks, his Ribs
par'd to the very Bone, with holes in his Shoulders, each large
enough to bury a Sevil Orange, that he looked as if a Kennel
of Hounds had every one had
a Snap at him. Under him lay
the Flitch of Bacon of such an
Ethiopian Complection, that I
should rather have guess'd it the
side of a Blackamore: It looking
more like a Cannibal's Feast
than a Christian Entertainment.  <figure id="fig.15" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00015"><head>'THE MERRY FIDLER.'</head></figure>
Being soon glutted with the view
of this unusual piece of Cookery,
we departed from thence, and
hearing a great bustle in the
Upper Room of an Outhouse,
we went up Stairs to see what
was the matter, where we found
a poor Fidler, scraping over the

 and a

Remembrance of the Uncles Cruelty to the poor Innocent

that their Dancing seem'd rather a Religious Worship, than

pungent satire, was the travelled fop who had brought back

John Bull, until he began to move about a bit, has always

<p>AND how did the women fare? We have seen that among
the middle classes the domestic virtues were encouraged
and highly extolled, and to be a  'notable housewife'  was a
legitimate and proper ambition; but how did the fine-lady
class spend their time? Were their lives more usefully
employed than those of the beaus ? <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName> says that he
remembers the time when ladies received visits in bed, and thus
graphically describes the custom :<note place="foot" n="1"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 45.</note>  ' It was then looked upon
as a piece of Ill breeding for a Woman to refuse to see a Man,
because she was not stirring; and a Porter would have been
thought unfit for his Place, that could have made so awkward
an Excuse. As I love to see everything that is new, I once
prevailed upon my Friend Will Honeycomb to carry me along
with him to one of these Travelled Ladies, desiring him at the
same time, to present me as a Foreigner who could not speak
English, so that I might not be obliged to bear a Part in the
Discourse. The Lady, tho' willing to appear undrest, had put
on her best Looks, and painted herself for our Reception. Her
Hair appeared in a very nice Disorder, as the Night Gown
which was thrown upon her Shoulders was ruffled with great
Care.' </p>
   <p>There is an amusing little pamphlet-not a chap book
proper <note place="foot" n="2"><hi rend="italics">The English Lady's Catechism</hi>. I have seen the original edition, dated

of the time of its birth, which gives an account of a fine
lady's life.
    'How do you employ your time now ?'
    'I lie in Bed till Noon, dress all the Afternoon, Dine in
the Evening, and play at Cards till Midnight.'
    'How do you spend the Sabbath ?'
    'In Chit Chat.'
    'What do you talk of?'
    ' New Fashions and New Plays.'
    'How often do you go to Church?'
    'Twice a year or oftener, according as my Husband gives
me new Cloaths.'
    'Why do you go to Church when you have new Cloaths ?'
    'To see other Peoples Finery, and to show my own, and
to laugh at those scurvy, out of fashion Creatures that come
there for Devotion.'
    'Pray, Madam, what Books do you read?'
    'I read lewd Plays and winning Romances.'
    'Who is it you love?'
    'Myself.'
    'What! nobody else?'
    'My Page, my Monkey, and my Lap Dog.'
    'Why do you love them?'
    'Why, because I am an English Lady, and they are Foreign
Creatures; my Page from Genoa, my Monkey from the East
Indies, and my Lap Dog from Vigo.' <note place="foot" n="3">This settles the date as being early in Anne's reign, as the galleons were
captured at Vigo in <date value="1702">1702</date>, and everything from Vigo was fashionable.</note>
    'Would not they have pleased you as well if they had been
English ?'
    'No, for I hate everything that Old England brings forth,
except it be the temper of an English Husband, and the liberty
of an English wife; I love the French Bread, French Wines,
French Sauces, and a French Cook; in short, I have all about
me French or Foreign, from my Waiting Woman to my Parrot.'

   <p>Virtually, these two different versions of how an idle
woman passed her time agree remarkably well, and they let
a whole flood of daylight into the inner life of the time-on
what they breakfasted, when they dined, what time the opera
began, etc. Apart from opera, the play, and cards, how were
the females of the middle class to amuse themselves of an
evening? Say they had been busy all day, the evenings
had to be passed somehow. There was very little of that
domesticity and home life of which we are so proud, for the
men spent their evenings at their club, their coffee-house, the
tavern, or the play, so they had to amuse themselves with
such innocent games as hot cockles, questions and commands,
mottoes, similes, cross purposes, blindman's buff, and a game
called  'Parson has lost his Cloak,'  or else  'Bouts rimes,'
which consisted of giving four terminal words of any kind
so that they rhymed, and then some one else filling up
the blank lines, and making four lines of sensible poetry.<note place="foot" n="8"> See <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 60.</note>
In fact, just the same amusements that are now
compelled to be resorted to as pastimes in a village home. The
better class had musical evenings, for chamber music was
popular, but the spinets and harpsichords were of moderate
compass, and very slight in sound. They danced country
dances too, any quantity of them; and there was the curse
of the age-cards-as a never-failing resource.</p>
    <p>The women did not walk much. <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> seems to think
 they did; but then a little walking went a long way with him.
 He quite boasts of his walk from and to <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> of a day, a
 good two-mile walk each way, as somewhat of a feat, and he




<pb n="94" id="p.94"/>

repeatedly grumbles at Stella for not walking more-tells her
to knock off her claret and buy a pair of good strong boots
and use them.<note place="foot" n="9"><hi rend="italics">Journal to Stella</hi>, letter 23.</note>  'When I pass the Mall in the evening it is
prodigious to see the number of ladies walking there; and I
always cry shame at the ladies of Ireland, who never walk at
all, as if their legs were of no use, but to be laid aside. ... I
tell you what, if I was with you, when we went to Stoyte, at
Donnybrook, we would only take a coach to the hither end
of Stephen's Green, and from thence go every step on foot;
yes, faith, every step.' </p>
   <p>The Mall was the fashionable lounge, or the Parade,
where smoking was not allowed.<note place="foot" n="10">The <hi rend="italics">London Spy</hi>.</note>  'From thence we walk'd
into the Parade, which my Friend told me us'd, in a Morning,
to be cover'd with the Bones of Red Herrings, and smelt as
strong about Breakfast Times as a Wet Salter's Shop at
Midsummer. But now, says he, its perfum'd again with English
Breath; and the scent of Oroonoko Tobacco no more offends
the Nostrils of our squeamish Ladies.'  And there were the
lucks to feed on the canal. But the Mall was the place.
<persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName> goes into ecstasies over it: never was there such a
sight.  'From thence we went thro' the Pallace into the Park
about the time when the Court Ladies raise their extended
Limbs from their downy Couches, and Walk into the Mall to
refresh their charming Bodies with the Cooling and Salubrious
Breezes of the Gilded Evening. We could not possibly have
chose a Luckier Minute to have seen the delightful Park in its
greatest Glory and Perfection; for the brightest Stars of the
Creation sure (that shine by no other Power than humane
Excellence) were moving here with such awful State and
Majesty that their Graceful Deportments bespoke 'em
Goddesses,'  etc.</p>
   <p>Of course they paid visits-how could women live without
a little gossip ? The invaluable <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName> takes a note of the
practice.  ' Persons of the first Quality visit one another in England
as much as we do in France, generally about Evening; but the
ordinary Sort of People have not that Custom. Among us all
the little Shopkeepers, particularly the Women, go with their
Gowns about their Heels to visit one another by Turns, either


<pb n="95" id="p.95"/>


to crack and bounce to one another, or else to sit with their
Arms a cross, and say nothing. What can be more tedious,
impertinent, and ridiculous than such Visits ? Here, Persons
of that Condition go to see one another with their Work in
their Hands and Chearfulness in their Countenance, without
Rule or Constraint. Upon certain Occasions, as upon Mourning
or Marriage, they pay one another Visits of Ceremony.'  <persName key="Brown,Thomas">Brown</persName>

manner, without hearing the Parties speak for themselves.
Nothing comes amiss to these Tribunals; matters of high and
no consequence, as Religion and Cuckoldom, Commodes and
Sermons, Politicks and Gallantry, Receipts of Cookery and
Scandal, Coquetry and Preserving, Jilting and Laundry; in
short, every thing is subject to the Jurisdiction of this Court,
and no Appeal lies from it. The Coach stops at the
Goldsmith's or Mercer's Door, and off leaps Mr. Skip Kennel from
behind it, and makes his Address to the Book Keeper or
Prentice, and asks if his Lady (for that is always the name of


<pb n="96" id="p.96"/>

the Mistress) receives any Visits that day or No; some stay
must be made till the Woman above stairs sends down her
Answer, and then the Pink of Courtesie is receiv'd at the top
of the Stairs, like King James by the French King, and handed
to her stool of discourse...  Thus they take a sip of Tea,
then for a draught or two of Scandal to digest it, next let it
be Ratafia, or any other Favourite Liquor, Scandal must be
the after draught to make it sit easie on their Stomach, till the
half hour's past, and they have disburthen'd themselves of
their Secrets, and take Coach for some other place to collect
new matter for Defamation.' </p>
   <p>Tea was then in its infancy, but it was an extremely
fashionable beverage, in spite of its expense, and the
teatable was the very centre of scandal and gossip.

   <p>One famous place for shopping was the New Exchange,
in <placeName key="the Strand">the Strand</placeName>, which must have been something like our
arcades; and many are the allusions, in contemporary
literature, to the dangerous allurements of the Exchange
shopgirls.  'Did you buy anything?  Some Bawbles. But my
choice was so distracted among the Pretty Merchants and
their Dealers, I knew not where to run first. One little lisping
Rogue, Ribbandths, Gloveths, Tippeths. Sir, cries another,
will you buy a fine Sword Knot; then a third, pretty voice
and Curtsie, Does not your Lady want Hoods, Scarfs, fine
green silk Stockings. I went by as if I had been in a Seraglio,
a living Gallery of Beauties-staring from side to side, I
bowing, they laughing; so made my escape.'  <note place="foot" n="13"><hi rend="italics">The Lying Lover</hi>.</note>

   <p>Another female practice, then, was to go to daily service
at church especially-and <placeName key="St. Paul's">St. Paul's</placeName>, <placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName>, was a
very fashionable church at which to worship, or ogle the
beaus. <note place="foot" n="14">The <hi rend="italics">London Spy</hi>.</note>  'This Market and that Church,'  says my friend,
 'hides more faults of kind Wives and Daughters among the
Neighbouring Inhabitants than the pretended Visits either to
my Cousin at t'other end of the Town, or some other distant
Acquaintance; for if the Husband asks, Where have you been,
Wife ? or the Parent, Where have you been, Daughter ? the
Answer, if it be after Eleven in the forenoon, or between Three
and Four in the Afternoon, is, At Prayers. But, if early in the
Morning, then their excuse is, I took a walk to <placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName>
Market, not being very well, to refresh myself with the scent
of the Herbs and Flowers; Bringing a Flower, or a Sprig of
Sweet Bryar, home in her Hand, and it confirms the matter.' </p>
  <p> When not walking, ladies used either a coach or a sedan
chair, and but seldom rode on horseback; but, when they did
so, they generally preferred the pillion to the side-saddle, as



<pb n="99" id="p.99"/>



in the accompanying illustration, and held on by the belt
either of her cavalier or groom.</p>
   <p>In the country, horse exercise was much more in vogue,
and <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> repeatedly alludes to, and reminds Stella of, her
riding. When riding, ladies very frequently wore masks to
protect the countenance from the rays of the sun.</p>
    <p>Frequent allusions are made to a lady's pets, her lap-dog
or her parrot; but very few people know the very wide range
of choice she had in the selection of those pets. Needless to
say there were monkeys, both Marmoset and other kinds;
there were paroquets, paroquets of Guinea, cockatoos and
macaws, scarlet nightingales from the West Indies, lorries
or lurries, canaries, both ash and lemon colour, white and
grey turtle doves from Barbary, white turtle doves, and the
turtle doves from Moco, no bigger than a lark, spotted very
fine.  There were milk-white peacocks,
white and pyed pheasants, bantams, and
furbelow fowls from the East Indies, and     <figure id="fig.19" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00019"><head>RIDING PILLION.</head></figure>
top-knot hens from Hamburg. She would
hardly want the  'Parcel of living Vipers,
fresh taken, fat and good, are to be sold
by the dozen,'  nor would she care about
the  'fine Tyger from the East Indies, who
was brought over together with some fine
geese from the same part of the world,'  and
some  'Amedawares.'  In fact there were
 'Jamrachs'  then as now, and many of the bird shops were
in <persName key="St. Martin's Lane">St. Martin's Lane</persName>, near which locality they still abound.
There is a curious advertisement in the <hi rend="italics">Postman</hi>, January
12/15, <date value="1706">1706</date>, which settles the date of bird-seed glasses
 'The so much approved and most convenient new fashion
Crystal Bird Glasses, which effectually prevent the Littering
of the Seeds into the Rooms.' </p>
   <p>An innocent amusement, of which they were very fond,
was dancing. And of dances there were a considerable
quantity: country dances and jigs, of which there was an
infinite variety, and minuets, rigadoons, and other more
stately and stagey dances, as the  'Louvre and the French
Brittagne.'  These latter were elaborate, and absolutely inaugurated


<pb n="100" id="p.100"/>

a fresh literature devoted to their cult. This seems
to have been started by one Thoinet Arbeau, in a book
published by him in <date value="1588">1588</date>, and he may be called the originator
of the ballet. Both Beauchamp and Feuillet wrote on this
subject in French. Feuillet's book was translated and
improved upon by Siris, in <date value="1706">1706</date>. John Weaver wrote on this
subject (in his  ' Orchesography' ) about <date value="1708">1708</date>, and John Essex
(in the  'Treatise of Chorography' ) in <date value="1710">1710</date>. The object was
to teach the different steps and dances, by means of diagrams.
Thus coupees, bourees, fleurets, bounds or tacs, contretemps,
chasses, sissones, pirouettes, capers, entrechats, etc., all had
their distinguishing marks.</p>
  <p>The effect of learning by this method is whimsically given

shake of the house, and as soon as I had got a little out of
my consternation I felt another, which was followed by two
or three repetitions of the same convulsion. I got up as fast
as possible, girt on my rapier, and snatched up my hat, when
my landlady came up to me and told me  "that the
gentlewoman of the next house begged me to step thither, for that
a lodger she had taken in was run mad, and she desired my
advice,"  as indeed everybody in the whole lane does upon
important occasions. I am not like some artists, saucy,
because I can be beneficial, but went immediately. Our
neighbour told us  " she had the day before let her second floor to a
very genteel youngish man, who told her he kept
extraordinary good hours, and was generally home most part of


<pb n="101" id="p.101"/>



the morning and evening at study; but that this morning he
had for an hour together made this extravagant noise which
we then heard."  I went up stairs with my hand upon the hilt
of my rapier, and approached this new lodger's door.</p>
   <p>'I looked in at the keyhole, and there I saw a well made
man look with great attention on a book, and on a sudden
jump into the air so high, that his head almost touched the
ceiling.  He came down safe on his right foot, and again
flew up, alighting on his left; then looked again at his book,
and holding out his right leg, put it into such a quivering
motion, that I thought he would have shaked it off. He then
used the left after the same manner, when on a sudden, to my
great surprise, he stooped himself incredibly low, and turned
gently on his toes. After this circular motion, he continued
bent in that humble posture for some time, looking on his
book. After this, he recovered himself with a sudden spring,
and flew round the room in all the violence and disorder
imaginable, until he made a full pause for want of breath.</p>
   <p>'In this interim, my women asked  "what I thought."  I
whispered,  " that I thought this learned person an enthusiast,
who possibly had his first education in the Peripatetic way,
which was a sect of Philosophers, who always studied when
walking."  But observing him much out of breath, I thought
it the best time to master him if he were disordered, and
knocked at his door. I was surprized to find him open it,
and say with great civility and good mien,  " that he hoped he
had not disturbed us."  I believed him in a lucid interval, and
desired  "he would please to let me see his book."  He did so,
smiling.  I could not make anything of it, and therefore
asked  " in what language it was writ."  He said,  "it was one
he studied with great application; that it was his profession
to teach it, and he could not communicate his knowledge
without a consideration."  I answered  " that I hoped he would
hereafter keep his thoughts to himself, for his meditation this
morning had cost me three coffee dishes, and a clean pipe."
He seemed concerned at that, and told me  " he was a dancing
master, and had been reading a dance or two before he went
out, which had been written by one who had been taught at
an Academy in France."  He observed me at a stand, and
<pb n="102" id="p.102"/>

went on to inform me,  "that now Articulate MOTIONS as
well as <hi rend="cl">SOUNDS</hi> were expressed by Proper <hi rend="cl">CHARACTERS</hi>,
and that there is nothing so common as to communicate a
Dance by a letter."  I besought him hereafter to meditate in
a ground room.' </p>
   <p>The public dancers were utilised in rather a curious way,
if we may credit <persName key="Centlivre,Susannah">Mrs. Centlivre</persName>-who certainly ought to
know. She says, in  'Love at a Venture,'   ' Sir Paul Cautious,
Go to the Play House, and desire some of the Singers and
Dancers to come hither,'  and the servant, later on in the
play, announces  'The Singers and Dancers are come, Sir.
(Here is songs and dances.)' </p>

<p>BUT primest and chief delight of men and women in this
age was CARDS. Never, perhaps, was such a card-playing
time-certainly not in England. Ombre, which is so vividly
described in the third canto of the  'Rape of the Lock,'  was a
game which could be played by two, three, or five
persons generally by three; to each of whom nine cards were dealt.
It takes its name from the Spanish, the person who
undertook to stand the game making use of the words  ' Yo soy
l'hombre,'   'I am the man.'  It was an improvement on Primero,
which disappeared after its introduction. L'hombre is still
played in Spain under the name of <title>Tresillo</title>, and in Spanish
America it is called <title>Rocambor</title>. <title>Piquet</title> is now played. Basset
was a very gambling game, closely resembling the modern
Faro; Whisk or Whist, Brag, Lanterloo, or Lanctre loo, in which
pam, or the knave of clubs, is the highest card :<note place="foot" n="1"><persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName>'s Adam and Eve strit of their Furbelows.</note>  'Were
she at her Parish Church, in the Height of her Devotion,
should any Body in the Interim but stand at the Church
Door and hold up the Knave of Clubs, she would take it to
be a Challenge at Lanctre Loo; and starting from her prayers,
would follow her beloved Pam, as a deluded Traveller does
an <foreign lang="LA">Ignis Fatuus'</foreign> ; and One and Thirty, which does not seem
a very extravagant game, judging by <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName>'s account of it.<note place="foot" n="2"> <hi rend="italics">Journal to Stella</hi>, letter 53.</note>

 'Lord Treasurer has had an ugly fit of the rheumatism,
but is now near quite well. I was playing at one and thirty
with him and his family the other night. He gave us all
twelvepence apiece to begin with.'  These were some of the
games <note place="foot" n="3">Other games were cribbage, all fours, ruff and honours, French ruff, five
cards, costly colours, bon ace, putt, plain dealing, Queen Nazareen, pennech,
post and pair, bankafalat, beast.</note> they delighted in; and the accompanying
illustration very vividly brings before us a quiet and pleasant game
at cards.</p>
   <p>The implements of gaming, the cards themselves, were
much smaller and thinner than those we are accustomed to
play with. They were not always confined to the prosaic
display of the pips and Court cards, as ours are, but took a
far more fanciful flight.  'Geographical, Geometrical,

victories of Marlborough and other events in Anne's reign;
Sacheverel cards; and anything for fashion-cards from
Vigo-in <date value="1702">1702</date>-after the great victory there; proverb cards;
all kinds of cards. The ordinary playing cards were cheap

Cards at 2s. 9d. a dozen; the best Principal superfine Basset

<pb n="105" id="p.105"/>



retailers averaged 1 1/2 d. per pack, and it is marvellous how
they could, at that time, be made for the money.</p>
   <p>By an Act of 10 Anne, c. 18, s. 176, etc., a duty of
sixpence per pack for cards, and five shillings a pair for dice,
was imposed; and all cards made and unsold before June 12,
<date value="1711">1711</date>, were to be brought in to be stamped, and pay a duty
of one halfpenny per pack, and dice 6d. a pair.</p>
   <p>The passion of women for gambling was a fruitful theme
for satire in those days.   ' She's a profuse Lady, tho' of a
Miserly Temper, whose Covetous Disposition is the very Cause
of her Extravagancy; for the Desire of Success wheedles
her Ladyship to play, and the incident Charges and
Disappointments that attend it, make her as expensive to her
Husband, as his Coach and six Horses. When an unfortunate
Night has happen'd to empty her Cabinet, she has many
Shifts to replenish her Pockets.  Her Jewels are carry'd
privately into Lombard Street, and Fortune is to be tempted
the next Night with another Sum, borrowed of my Lady's
Goldsmith at the Extortion of a Pawnbroker; and if that
fails, then she sells off her Wardrobe, to the great grief of her
Maids ; stretches her Credit amongst those she deals with, or
makes her Waiting Woman dive into the Bottom of her
Trunk, and lug out her green Net Purse full of old Jacobuses,
in Hopes to recover her losses by a Turn of Fortune, that
she may conceal her bad Luck from the Knowledge of her
Husband.'  <note place="foot" n="4"> 'The Gaming Lady, or Bad Luck to him that has her,'  <hi rend="italics">in Adam and Eve

hinted at in divers authors. One or two examples will

   <p>But we must not think that the fair ones monopolised the
enjoyment of this passion-the sterner sex were equally
culpable.  Gaming houses were plentiful.  The  ' Groom

 'Whereas Her Majesty, by her Letters Patent to Thomas
Archer Esq. constituting him Her Groom Porter, hath given
full Power to him and such Deputies as he shall appoint, to
supervise, regulate, and authorize (by and under the Rules,

manner of Gaming within this Kingdom. And, whereas
several of Her Majesty's Subjects, keeping Plays or Games in

   <p>If scenes like this were enacted at the Groom Porter's,
what must have taken place at the other gaming houses ?




<pb n="107" id="p.107"/>


Let two contemporary writers, whose language, though rough,
is trustworthy, answer the question.  'Gaming is an Estate
to which all the World has a Pretence, tho' few espouse it

<figure id="fig.22" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00022"><head>A GAMBLING SCENE.</head></figure>
that are willing to keep either their Estates, or Reputations.
I knew two <hi rend="italics">Middlesex Sharpers</hi> not long ago, that inherited
a West Country Gentleman's Estate, who I believe, wou'd

<pb n="108" id="p.108"/>
have never made them   his Heirs in his last Will and
Testament.</p>
   <p>'Lantrillou is a kind of a Republick very ill ordered,
where all the World are Hail Fellow well met; no distinction
of Ranks, no Subordination observed. The greatest Scoundrel
of the Town, with Money in his Pockets, shall take his Turn
before the best Duke or Peer in the Land, if the Cards are on
his side. From these Privileg'd Places not only all Respect
and Inferiority is Banish'd; but every thing that looks like
Good Manners, Compassion, or Humanity: Their Hearts are
so Hard and Obdurate, that what occasions the Grief of one
Man, gives Joy and Satisfaction to his next Neighbour....</p>
  <p>'In some Places they call Gaming Houses <foreign lang="FR">Academies;</foreign></p>
<p>but I know not why they should inherit that Honourable
Name, since there's nothing to be learn'd there, unless it be
Slight of Hand, which is sometimes at the Expence of all our
Money, to get that of other Men's by Fraud and Cunning.
The Persons that meet are generally Men of an Infamous
Character, and are in various Shapes, Habits and
Employments. Sometimes they are Squires of the Pad, and now
and then borrow a little Money upon the King's High Way,
to recruit their losses at the Gaming House, and when a Hue
and Cry is out, to apprehend them, they are as safe in one of
these Houses as a Priest at the Altar, and practise the old
trade of Cross biting Cullies, assisting the Frail Square Dye
with high and low Fullums, and other Napping Tricks, in
comparison of whom the common Bulkers, and Pickpockets,
are a very honest Society. How unaccountable is this way
to Beggary, that when a Man has but a little Money, and
knows not where in the World to compass any more, unless
by hazarding his Neck for 't, will try an Experiment to leave
himself none at all: Or, he that has Money of his own, should
play the Fool, and try whether it shall not be another Man's.
Was ever any thing so Nonsensically Pleasant?</p>
   <p>'One idle day I ventur'd into one of these Gaming Houses,
where I found an Oglio of Rakes of several Humours, and
Conditions met together. Some that had left them never a
Penny to bless their Heads with. One that had play'd away
even his Shirt and Cravat, and all his Clothes but his



<pb n="109" id="p.109"/>

Breeches, stood shivering in a Corner of the Room, and
another comforting him, and saying, Damme Jack, who ever
thought to see thee in a State of Innocency: Cheer up,
Nakedness is the best Receipt in the World against a Fever;
and then fell a Ranting, as if Hell had broke loose that very
Moment. ... I told my friend, instead of Academies these

do you take those Knot of Gentlemen to be, who are so
Merry with one another?  They, reply'd my Friend, are
Gamesters, waiting to pick up some young Bubble or other as
he comes from his Chamber; they are Men whose Conditions
are subject to more Revolutions than a Weather Cock, or the
Uncertain Mind of a Fantastical Woman. They are seldom
two Days in one and the same Stations, they are one day
very richly drest, and perhaps out at Elbows the next; they
have often a great deal of Money, and are as often without a
Penny in their Pockets; they are as much Fortunes Bubbles,
as young Gentlemen are theirs; for whatever benefits she
bestows upon 'em with one Hand, she snatches away with
t'other; their whole Lives are a Lottery, they read no books
but Cards, and all their Mathematicks is to truly understand
the Odds of a Bet; they very often fall out, but very seldom
Fight, and the way to make 'em your Friends is to Quarrel
with them. . . . They generally begin every Year with the
same Riches; for the Issue of their Annual Labours is chiefly
to inrich the Pawnbrokers. They are seldom in Debt,
because no Body will Trust 'em; and they never care to Lend
Money, because they Know not where to Borrow it. A Pair
of False Dice, and a Pack of mark'd Cards sets 'em up; and
an Hours Unfortunate Play commonly breaks 'em.' </p>
  <p> These professional swindlers belonged to all classes of
society, and some who died in this reign have left names

behind them: St. Evremont, Beau Fielding, Macartney, who
was Lord Mahun's second in his celebrated duel with the

Harley, the Earl of Oxford. Their Lives, and many others,
are given by Lucas,<note place="foot" n="11"> <hi rend="italics">Memoirs of the Lives. Intrigues and Comical Adventures of the most famous

example, to show the equality that play made between the
different social grades. Bourchier died in <date value="1702">1702</date>, so-that he
just comes within this reign.  'Being at the <hi rend="italic">Groom Porter's</hi>,
he flung one Main with the Earl of <hi rend="italic">Mulgrave</hi> for 500 Pounds,
which he won; and his Honour looking wistly at him, quoth
he, <hi rend="italic">I believe I shou'd know you.  Yes </hi>(reply'd the Winner)
<hi rend="italic">your Lordship must have some Knowledge of me, for my Name
is</hi> Dick Bourchier, <hi rend="italic">who was once your Footman</hi>. Whereupon
his Lordship supposing he was not in a Capacity of paying
500 Pounds in case he had lost, cry'd out, <hi rend="italic">A Bite, A Bite</hi>.
But the <hi rend="italic">Groom Porter</hi> assuring his Lordship that Mr.
<hi rend="italic">Bourchier</hi> was able to have paid 1,000 Pounds provided his
Lordship had won such a Summ, he paid him what he plaid for,
without any farther Scruple.' </p>
  <p>  ' Once Mr. <hi rend="italic">Bourchier</hi> going over to Flanders, with a great
Train of Servants, set off in such a fine Equipage, that they
drew the Eyes of all upon them wherever they went, to
admire the Splendor and Gaiety of their Master, whom they
look for no less than a Nobleman of the first Rank. In this
Pomp, making his Tour at K. William's Tent, he happen'd
into Play with that great Monarch, and won of him above
&#x00A3;pound;pound;2,500. The Duke of Bavaria being also there, he took up
the cudgels, and losing &#x00A3;pound;pound;15,000 the Loss put him into a great
Chafe, and doubting some foul Play was put upon him,
because Luck went so much against him, quoth Mr. <hi rend="italic">Bourchier:
Sir, if you have any suspicion of the least Sinister Trick put
upon your Highness, if you please I'll give you a Chance for all
your Money at once, tossing up at Cross and Pile, and you shall
have the Advantage too of throwing up the Guinea yourself.</hi>
The Elector admir'd at his bold Challenge, which never the
less accepting, he tost up for &#x00A3;pound;pound; 15,000, and lost the Money




<pb n="111" id="p.111"/>

upon Reputation, with which Bourchier was very well
satisfied, as not doubting in the least; and so taking his leave of
the King, and those Noblemen that were with him, he
departed. Then the Elector of Bavaria enquiring of his Majesty,
who that Person was, that could run the Hazard of playing
for so much Money at a time, he told him it was a subject of
his in England, that though he had no real Estate of his own,
yet was he able to play with any Sovereign Prince in
Germany. Shortly after Bourchier returning into England, he
bought a most rich Coach and Curious Sett of Six Horses to
it, which cost him above &#x00A3;pound;pound;3,000, for a present to the Elector
of Bavaria, who had not as yet paid him any thing of the
&#x00A3;pound;pound;30,000 which he had won of him. Notice hereof being sent
to his Highness, the generous Action incited him to send
over his Gentleman of Horse into England, to take care of
this Present, which he receiv'd Kindly at Bourchier's Hands,
to whom he return'd Bills of Exchange also, drawn upon
several eminent Merchants in London, for paying what Money
he had lost with him at Play.' </p>
   <p>Bourchier became very rich, and purchased an estate near
Pershore, in Worcestershire, where he was buried-although
he died in London.</p>
   <p>The lower classes followed the example of their social
superiors, and gambled; but once only can I find such an
instance of gaming fever as the following:<note place="foot" n="12"> <hi rend="italics">The English Post</hi>, October 12/14, <date value="1702">1702</date>.

   <p> There was a speculating mania arising, which boded ill
 for the future. In this reign was born the  'South Sea Bubble,'
 which burst so disastrously in the next, and involved
thousands in ruin. Perhaps the mildest form it took was in
 insurances. We have already glanced at the fire insurances
 in Queen Anne's time; they now began to think of life
 insurance, and the first advertisement on this subject that I
 have noticed is in <date value="1709">1709</date>. ' The Office of Assurance of Money
 upon Lives is at the Rainbow Coffee House in Cornhill, where
 Men or Women may Subscribe on their own Lives for the
 benefit of their Children, or other Person's Lives for the
benefit of themselves, and have them approv'd without their
 Knowledge, paying 10s. Entrance, and 10s. towards the first
 Claim for each Life, and shall have a Policy for &#x00A3;pound;pound; 1,000 for
 each Life subscribed upon in the said Society. This Office
 may be proper for such Persons as have Annuities, Estates, or
 Places for Life; and for such Persons to make Assurance
 upon Lives where Debts are dubious if the Person die. This
 Office will assure Money much Cheaper per cent. than private
 Persons.'  This looks very much as if it were the first life
 insurance company that was started, in lieu of private
enterprise; and as this is the only company that is advertised in
 Queen Anne's reign, it was probably the sole forerunner of
 the numerous similar enterprises now in existence.</p>
  <p>  Hatton says,  'Offices that Insure Ships or their Cargo are
many about the <placeName key="Royal Exchange">Royal Exchange</placeName>, as Mr. Hall's, Mr. Bevis's,
etc., who for a Premium paid down procure those that will

proportioned to the Distance, Danger of Seas, Enemies, etc. But
in these Offices 'tis Customary upon paying the Money on a
Loss to discount 16 per cent.' </p>
   <p> A curious marine insurance was in existence early in
<date value="1711">1711</date>, of which the following is the advertisement; but it seems
a sporting insurance, and only meant to cover the war risk.

  <p> There were besides-and they sprang up as if by magic
-insurances for everything: for marriages, for births, for
baptisms-rank swindles all.  And lotteries! why, every
thing, unsaleable otherwise, was tried to be got rid of by
lottery. The papers teemed with advertisements. Take one
newspaper haphazard; for example, the <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, Sept. 14/ 16,
171O:  'Mr. Stockton's Sale of Jewels, Plate, &amp;c., will be
drawn on Michaelmas Day.'   ' The Lottery in Colson's Court
is to be drawn the 21st Inst.'   'The Sale of Goods to be seen
at Mrs. Butler's, &amp;c., will certainly be drawn on Tuesday the
19th Inst.'   'Mrs. Povy's Sale of Goods is put off to Saturday
23rd Inst.'   'Mrs. Symond's Sale of Goods will begin, &amp;c.,
on Wednesday the 20th of this Instant.'   'Mrs. Guthridge's
Sixpenny Sale of Goods, &amp;c., continues to be drawn every

   <p>The financial atmosphere was getting unwholesome,
Government had to step in, and an Act was passed which
duly appeared in the <hi rend="italics">London Gazette</hi>, June 28/July I, <date value="1712">1712</date>,
which enacted  'That every Person who, after the 24 June

lotteries-and they soon ceased.</p>
    <p>Of course, morally speaking, the Government had no right
to complain, for they had begun the system--by legalising a
lottery for &#x00A3;pound;pound;1,500,000 in <date value="1709">1709</date>-from  which time until <date value="1824">1824</date>
no year passed without Parliament sanctioning a Lottery
Bill. It is not worth while going into the schemes of the
various lotteries in Queen Anne's reign, but it may be
interesting to note the constitution of the one which inaugurated
an indefensible system of immoral finance, which lasted over
a century.  There were 150,000 tickets at &#x00A3;pound;pound;10 each, making
&#x00A3;pound;pound; 1,500,000, the principal of which was to be sunk, and
9 per cent. to be allowed on it for 32 years. Three thousand
seven hundred and fifty tickets were prizes from &#x00A3;pound;pound;<date value="1000">1000</date> to
&#x00A3;pound;pound;5 per annum; the rest were blanks-a proportion of
thirtynine to one prize, but, as a consolation, each blank was entitled
to fourteen shillings per annum during the thirty-two years.</p>
    <p>People rushed after the tickets, and they were taken up
at once.  '21 Jan. <date value="1710">1710</date>.-Yesterday books were opened at
Mercer's Chappel for receiving subscriptions for the lottery,

that my lord bestowing one ticket, which is a hundred
pounds, to one of his servants, who had been his page, the

   <p>In some of the lotteries the prizes were very valuable, for
we read in the <hi rend="italics">Post boy</hi>, Jan. 6/8, <date value="1713">1713</date>, that  'Yesterday was
drawn No. 22858, which entitles the Bearer to &#x00A3;pound;pound;36,000.' </p>
  <p> The accompanying engraving shows us exactly how the
lotteries were drawn; and, as it is taken from a book
published in <date value="1710">1710</date>, in all probability it is a correct representation
of the famous first State lottery of <date value="1709">1709</date>. Bluecoat boys,
then, as in <date value="1824">1824</date>, drew out the tickets.</p>

 <p>IT is not for us to decry the superstition of that age-we
 should look to ourselves in this matter. Perhaps they were
 more open in their expression of belief in the supernatural,
 and perhaps that belief was wider spread than at present.
 The seventh <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> gives a very good account of the minor
 superstitions, but does not touch on the grosser ones, such
 as the consulting of astrologers, and the belief in witches.
 These two things still exist in England, though nothing like
 to the extent they did in the early part of the last century.
 In spite of Hudibras and Sidrophel, an astrologer was a very
 important entity.  He published his almanacs-he drew
 horoscopes; and, as to witches, why, of course there were
 plenty of them. An old, ugly, soured, and malevolent
 woman earned a right to be considered such.</p>
   <p> As for the astrologers, it is needless to say they were
unscrupulous, needy sharpers, who lived  'in all the By-Allies in
Moorfields, White Chappel, Salisbury Court, Water Lane,
<placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, and <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.'  Their advertisements have
come down to us, and a selection of two or three of them will
furnish both amusement and information.</p>

   <p>In this case we see the astrologer using the jargon of
the alchemists, to enhance his value in the eyes of his dupes.
It was still familiar to the ears of the people, and Jonson's
 ' Alchemist'  was a popular play. The succeeding examples
are more commonplace:-</p>

whatsoever it be, was taken away by the Common Thief, or stolen
by a Servant, or Person that uses the House, or whether
Conceal'd by the Master or Mistress on purpose to make the
Servants more diligent. If his Conjecture be, that it was
taken by a Common Thief, he describes a Swarthy Black Ill
looking Fellow, with a down look, or the like; most wisely
considering, That such sort of Rogues are seldom without a
Gallows in their Countenances: Telling withall, That the
Goods are Pawn'd, and will scarcely be recoverable, without
they take the Thief speedily, in order to effect which, he
will give them his best Directions; which the credulous
Ignoramus desires in Writing, for fear he should forget; which
the Sower look'd Conjurer gives him accordingly, after the
following manner:-<hi rend="italic">Go a quarter of a Mile from your own
Dwelling, and then turn Easterly, and walk forward till you
come to the Sign of a large Four Footed Beast, and Search
within three or four Doors of that Sign, and you will go near
to take him, if you go soon enough, or hear of him, who is of a
middle Stature and in poor Habit.</hi> Away goes the Fool, as
well satisfied with the Note, as if he had the Rogue by the
Elbow, and if by any Accident they do hear of the Thief, all
is ascrib'd to the wonderful Cunning of their Wissard: But if
on the contrary, he believes it to be taken by a Servant, or
any Body that uses the House, he bids 'em, hab nab at a
venture, <hi rend="italics">Go home satisfied, for they shall certainly find the
Spoon, &amp;c. in three or four days' time, hid in a private Hole, in
such a part of the Kitchen, or he'll make the Devil to do with those
that have it; and force them to bring it in open shame and
disgrace at Dinner time, and lay it down upon the Table in the
Sight of the whole Family.</hi> Away goes the Person well
satisfied with what their <hi rend="italics">Ptolomist</hi> had told 'em: and declares to
every one in the House how the Thief was Threaten'd, and
after what manner the Spoon should be found within the time

<pb n="122" id="p.122"/>

appointed, or else woe be to them that have it. This Frightful
Story coming to the Ears of the Guilty, brings 'em under
such dreadful Apprehensions of the Conjuror's Indignation, if
they do not lay what they've taken within the time, according
to the Direction; that the first opportunity they have, they
will place it to the utmost exactness in whatever Hole or
Corner he has appointed for the finding of it.' </p>
<p>   The belief in witchcraft was still firmly rooted in the
country in spite of the more enlightened feeling on the subject
which prevailed in the metropolis. <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName>
<note place="foot" n="5"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 117.</note>
tells us of the
Coverley Witch, Moll White, how he and Sir Roger went and
visited her hovel, and found a broomstick behind the door,
and the tabby cat, which had as evil a reputation as its
mistress, and how  'In our return home, Sir Roger told me
that Old Moll had been often brought before him for making
Children spit Pins, and giving Maids the Night Mare; and
that the Country People would be tossing her into a Pond
and trying Experiments with her every Day, if it was not for
him and his Chaplain.' </p>
<p>   A little before this was written, two women had been
executed at Northampton for witchcraft, and at that very
time an old woman named Jane Wenham, living at a little
village in Hertfordshire called Walkerne, was charged with,
and next year tried for, witchcraft. She was condemned,
reprieved, and pardoned. But in <date value="1716">1716</date> Mrs. Hicks and her
daughter were executed at Huntingdon, and their crime was
that of selling their souls to the devil, etc. Indeed, the
capital sentence against witchcraft was only abolished by
an Act 9 Geo. II. cap. 5.</p>
   <p>There are two other published cases of witchcraft in
Queen Anne's time. One <note place="foot" n="6">British Museum, 515,l.2./ 15.</note>
 is the  'Full and True Account of
the Apprehending and Taking of Mrs. Sarah Mordike, Who is
accused for a Witch. Being taken near Paul's Wharf on
Thursday the 24th of this Instant, for having Bewitch'd one

Bow Lane.'  It was an ordinary case: the bewitched person
lost his appetite, voided pins, etc., and got better when he
had scratched and brought blood from Moll Dyke, as she was
familiarly called. The other, if at all credible, is a much
worse case: <note place="foot" n="7">British Museum, 515,l.2./199.</note> ' A Full and True Account of the Discovering,
Apprehending and taking of a Notorious Witch, who was

  <p> 'Sarah Griffith who Lived in a Garret in Rosemary lane

could be prov'd against her that the Law might take hold
of her. Tho' some of the Neighbours' Children would be
strangely effected with unknown Distempers, as Vomiting of
Pins, their Bodies turn'd into strange Postures and such like,
many were frighted with strange Apperitions of Cats, which
of a sudden would vanish away, these and such like made
those who lived in the Neighbourhood, both suspicious and
fearful of her: Till at last the Devil (who always betrays
those that deal with him) thus brought the Truth to Light.
One Mr. John -- at the Sugar loaf had a good jolly fellow
for his Apprentice: This Old Jade came into his Shop to buy
a quartern of Sope, the young fellow happened to Laugh, and
the Scales not hanging right, cryed out he thought that they
were be Witch'd; The Old Woman hearing him say so, fell
into a great Passion, judging he said so to Ridicule her, ran
out of the Shop and threatned Revenge. In the Night was
heard a lumbring noise in the Shop, and the Man coming
down to see, found a strange Confusion, every thing turn'd
topsy turvy, all the goods out of order; but what was worse,
the next day the poor fellow was troubled with a strange
Disease, but (by) the good Prayers of some Neighbouring
Divines the power of the Devil was restrain'd.</p>
   <p>'Two or three days after it happened, that the Young Man

us toss her into the River, for I have heard that if she Swims
'tis a certain sign of a Witch; in short they put their design
in Execution, for coming up to her, they tossed her in; but
like a Bladder when forc'd under Water pops up again, so
this Witch was no sooner in but Swam like a Corke; they
kept her in some time, and at last let her come out again;
she was no sooner out but she smote that Young Man
on the Arm, and told him he should pay dear for what
he had done. Immediately he found a strange pain on his
Arm, and looking on it found the exact mark of her Hand
and Fingers as black as a Cole; he went home where he lay
much Lamented and wonderfully affrighted with the Old
Woman coming to afflict him, and at last died with the pain,
and (was) Buried in St. Pulchers Church Yard.</p>
  <p> 'Mr. John -- fearing some further mischief, takes a
Constable and goes to her Lodging, where he finds the Old

was conducted towards the Justices' House she tried to leap
over the Wall, and had done it, had not the Constable
knocked her down. In this manner she was carried before
the Justice, there was Evidence that was with him in his
Sickness could Witness that he had unaccountable Fits, Vomitted
up Old Nails, Pins and such like, his body being turned into
strange postures, and all the while nothing but crying out of
Mother Griffith that she was come to torment him, his Arm

<p>THERE was one social habit that the two sexes had in
common, and that was in taking snuff: nay, it was more
than hinted that some of the fair sex smoked-not nice little
fairy  'Paquitas'  or dainty little cigarettes, but nasty, heavy,
clumsy clay pipes. The subject will be discussed in another
part, but now we merely glance at the prevalence of the
habit-not so much with the ladies, as it was later on in the
century, but with the gentlemen; and the quantity taken, in
the latter part of the reign, was excessive.</p>
  <p> It is a marvel how the ladies at first allowed it, for it was
the custom in society for a gentleman to kiss all the ladies
in a room-a custom frequently mentioned in contemporary
literature, and therefore only requiring one quotation <note place="foot" n="1"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 272.</note>to
illustrate it:  'The other Day entering a Room adorned with
the Fair Sex, I offered, after the usual Manner, to each of
them a Kiss; but one, more scornful than the rest, turned
her Cheek. I did not think it proper to take any Notice of
it till I had asked your Advice.' </p>
   <p>Besides, the ladies were undoubtedly fond of sweet smells,
perfumes, and scents; and one, in particular, seems to have
possessed remarkable properties.  'The Princely Perfume.
Being a most delightful Powder, which incomparably scents
Handkerchiefs, Gloves, and all Sorts of Linnen, making them
smell most deliciously oderiferous, fine and charming; it
perfumes the Hands, the Hair of the Head, and Periwigs


<pb n="126" id="p.126"/>

most delicately, also all Manner of Cloaths, Beds, Rooms,
Scrutores, Presses, Drawers, Boxes, and all other Things,
giving them a most admirable, pleasant and durable Scent,
which is so curiously fragrant, so delectably sweet, reviving
and enlivening, that no Perfume or Aromatick in the World,
can possibly come near it; it never raises the vapours in
Ladies, but, by its delicious Odour, Fragrancy and charming
Perfume (which is really Superior to all other Scents upon
Earth) it refreshes the Memory, cures the Head Ach, takes
away Dulness and Melancholy, makes the Heart glad, and
encreases all the Spirits, Natural, Vital, and Animal, to a
Wonder.'  <note place="foot" n="2"><hi rend="italics">Daily Courant</hi>, Feb. 14, <date value="1708">1708</date>.</note> And there was a much bepuffed scent called the
 'Royal Essence,'  which, besides being a paragon of perfume,
had the useful quality of curling the Periwig.</p>
   <p>But the prince of perfumers and puffers was
<persName key="Lillie,Charles">Charles Lillie</persName>, whose connection with the <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi> is so well known,
and who was so belauded, that <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName>, or <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>, in No. 96,
had to issue a disclaimer.  'Whereas several have
industriously spread abroad, that I am in partnership with
<persName key="Lillie,Charles">Charles LILLIE</persName> the perfumer, at the corner of Beaufort Buildings ;-I
must say with my friend PARTRIDGE, that they are Knaves
who reported it. However, since the said Charles has
promised that all his customers shall be mine, I must desire
all mine to be his; and dare answer for him, that if you ask
in my name for Snuff, Hungary or orange water, you shall
have the best the town affords at the cheapest rate.' </p>
   <p>When <persName key="Lillie,Charles">Lillie</persName> died, he left his MS. receipts behind him,
made into a book, but it was never published till <date value="1822">1822</date>; and

 <item> Oil of marjoram  </item>       <item> Cordova water</item>
<item>  Oil of coriander</item></list>
<p>
  This reads like a very sufficient list of scents; that it
was not greater was undoubtedly owing to the disturbed
state of trade, and the absence of geographical
discoverywhich of late years has greatly increased the perfumer's
repertoire.</p>
   <p>There were soaps enough, in all conscience-Joppa,
Smyrna, Jerusalem, Genoa, Venice, Castille, Marseilles,
Alicant, French, Gallipoly, Curd, Irish, Bristol, Windsor,
Black, and Liquid Soaps-and yet the ladies would use
abominations called  'Wash balls.'  These must have been a
profitable manufacture, for the makers advertised freely in
the papers. Let us look into a  'Composition for best Wash
balls. Take forty pounds of rice in fine powder, twenty-eight
pounds of fine flour, twenty-eight pounds of Starch powder,
twelve pounds of white lead, and four pounds of Oris root in
fine powder; but no whitening. Mix the whole well together,
and pass it twice through a fine hair seive; then place it in a
dry place, and keep it for use. Great care must be taken
that the flour be not Musty, in which case the balls will in
time crack, and fall to pieces. To this composition may be
added Dutch pink, or brown fine damask powder, &amp;c.,
according to the Colour required when the wash balls are quite dry.'
These wash balls were in some variety-common, best
camphor, ambergris, Bologna, marbled, figured, Greek,
Marseilles, Venice, and chemical.</p>
   <p>This making up of complexions was an art, and would
not bear trifling with.  'Madam, who dress'd you ? Here's
this Tooth set in the wrong way, and your Face so besmear'd !
What Complection do you use ? This is worse than they

<pb n="128" id="p.128"/>

daub Sign posts with; I never saw any thing so frightful.'  <note place="foot" n="3"><hi rend="italics">The Gentleman Cully</hi>, ed. <date value="1702">1702</date>.</note>
Naturally, with such an ingredient as white lead in their
composition, these wash balls were injurious to the
skin--<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="LA">vide</foreign></hi> a letter in <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 41.  ' Her skin is so tarnished
with this Practice, that when she first wakes in a Morning,
she scarce seems young enough to be the Mother of her whom
I carried to bed the Night before.'  No wonder, for they used
carmine, French red, Portuguese dishes, Spanish wool and
papers, Chinese wool, and they had, also, pretty little lacquered
boxes of paints for the toilette sent over from China. There
was a wonderful  'bloom'  advertised, ' The famous Bavarian
Red Liquor, which gives such a blushing Colour to the
Cheeks of those that are white or pale, that it is not to be
distinguished from a natural fine Complection, nor perceived
to be Artificial by the nearest Friend, is nothing of Paint,
or in the least hurtful, but good in many Cases to be taken
inwardly; it renders the Face delightfully handsome and
beautiful, is not subject to be rub'd off like Paint, therefore
cannot be discovered by any one.'  There were also pearl and
bismuth powders for the face.</p>
   <p>Rose and white lip salves were used as now, but their
dentifrices were peculiar, to say the least, if this is a fair
sample:  'Take four ounces of Coral, reduced to an unpalpable
powder, eight ounces of very light Armenian bole, one ounce
of Portugal Snuff, one ounce of Havanah Snuff, one ounce of
the ashes of good tobacco, which has been burnt, and one
ounce of gum myrrh, which has been well pulverised. Mix
all these well together, and sift them twice.'  An inferior
tooth powder was made by leaving out the coral and
substituting old broken pans (brown stone ware) reduced to a very
fine powder.  These mixtures were either rubbed on the
teeth with the finger, or else used with a vegetable tooth
brush or  'Dentissick Root,'  which seems to have been made
out of the roots of the marsh mallow, partially dried, and then
fried in a mixture of rectified spirits, dragon's blood, and
conserve of roses, until they were hard; when one end was
bruised with a hammer, in order to open the fibres and form
a rudimentary brush. There were dentists, both male and




<pb n="129" id="p.129"/>

female, and they seem to have been so far successful that
some of them guarantee their patients being able to eat with
the false teeth after they were fixed.  'So firm and exact as
to be eat on, and not to be discover'd by any Person from
Natural Ones.' </p>
    <p>The usual way of darkening the hair was by the
mechanical means of a leaden comb. <note place="foot" n="4"><hi rend="italics">Tunbridge Walks</hi>, ed. <date value="1703">1703</date>.</note>  'Jenny Trapes ! What that
Carrot pated Jade that Lodges at the Corner of White Horse
Alley !--The Same indeed, only She has black'd her Hair
with a Leaden Comb.'  But there were also <soCalled>'Hair Restorers'</soCalled>
in those days, as we find by an advertisement, that <soCalled>'All
Persons who, for themselves or Friend, having red or grey Hairs,
and would have them dy'd, or turn'd black or dark brown,
will find entire Satisfaction, as a great many have already, by
the use of a Clear Water,'</soCalled> etc.</p>
<p>   Should the sight fail, it could be aided by spectacles, as
now-but they were awsome things-with heavy horn,
tortoiseshell, or silver rims, and were certainly no adjuncts to
personal appearance. They varied in price from 4d. to 25s.

<p>AMONG the social institutions then in existence, was the
penny post, which cannot be better, or more tersely,
described than in <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName>'s own words: <quote>'Every two Hours you

receives it pays a Penny, and you give nothing when you put
it into the Post; but when you write into the Country, both
he that writes and he that receives pay each a Penny. It
costs no more for any Bundle weighing but a Pound, than for
a small Letter, provided the Bundle is not worth more than
ten Shillings. You may safely send Money, or any other
thing of Value, by this Conveyance, if you do but take care
to give the Office an Account of it. It was one Mr.
<persName key="Dockwra,William">William Dockwra</persName> that set up this New Post, about the beginning of
the Reign of King Charles 2, and at first enjoy'd the Profits
himself; but the Duke of York who had then the Revenue
of the General Post, commenc'd a Suit against him, and
united the Penny Post to the other.'</quote>
   <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName> makes a slight error here. The penny post was
started in <date value="1683">1683</date> by Rob. Murray, an upholsterer, but next
year, several charges being brought against him, he was
removed, and the concern was handed over to <persName key="Dockwra,William">Dockwra</persName>,
who was dispossessed as above, by an action in which he was
cast both in damages and costs; but, about a year after, he

was appointed Controller of the District Post. He was
allowed a pension in the time of William and Mary (variously
stated of from &#x00A3;200 to &#x00A3;500 a year), but he only enjoyed it
four years, when he was discharged on account of some charges
of malversation, etc., which were brought against him.</p>

    <p> 'Whereas a malicious false Report has been industriously
spread, that one Robert Murray was the first Inventor of the
Penny Post, and that he has been in Articles with me
<persName key="Dockwra,William">William Dockwra</persName>, and wrong'd and hardly used; the World is desired
to take notice, That as to the first Pretence, it is utterly false,
for Dr. Chamberlen, one Henry Neville, Payne, and others
pretended themselves the first Inventors; And after I had
actually set up the Office, one Mr. Foxley came and shew'd
me a Scheme of his concerning a Penny Post, which he had
offer'd to Sir John Bennet, Post Master General, eight Years
before I ever Knew Murray, but that was rejected as
impracticable, as indeed were all the rest of their Notions; nor
was it by any of them, or any other Person whatsoever, put
into any Method to make it practicable, till at my sole Charge
and Hazard I begun it in the Year <date value="1680">1680</date>.</p>
   <p>'As to the Articles, they were sacredly Kept on my part,
but never perform'd by Murray, to my great Loss and
Damage, as by the very Articles themselves will evidently
appear; and I am ready at any time to demonstrate, it is so
far from having One Shilling due to him, or using him any
way hardly, That on the Contrary, in Compassion to his
distressed Condition, I have often bayl'd him to keep him out
of Prison, and redeem'd him from thence, lent him several
Sums of Money, which he never took care to pay again; and
to this day I have Notes and Bonds to Produce, that he owes
me more than One hundred and Fifty Pounds: So that these
most unjust and ungrateful Allegations in Murray, are at this
time reviv'd to be made use of, as malicious Reflections to
lessen my Service to this City, and to stain my Reputation


<pb n="132" id="p.132"/>

and Integrity thereby, to hinder my Fellow Citizens Kindness
upon the Election for Chamberlain, which I hope will make
no Impression, since I do affirm myself to be the first that
ever put the Penny Post into Practice at a vast Expence and
great Loss to me and my Family.
                                 ' <persName key="Dockwra,William">WILLIAM DOCKWRA</persName>.' </p>

    <p>And in the next day's Courant he was obliged to defend
himself from other allegations.</p>
    <p> 'Whereas some Malicious Persons, designing to lessen me
in the good Opinion of my Fellow Citizens, have spread a
False and Scandalous Report, that I, <persName key="Dockwra,William">William Dockwra</persName>, was
remov'd from being Comptroller of the Penny Post, because
of Injuries done to the Subject; and that I sunk the Revenue
at least one fourth part to the Crown. I do hereby declare,
That on the Contrary, I rectified many Abuses in the
Management of that Office, and never wrong'd either Crown or
Subject of the Value of a Shilling: And I do positively affirm,
That I prov'd undeniably before the Post Master General
by the Accounts then made up, that I advanced that small
Revenue above Four Hundred Pounds: Yet neither my
Right to the whole (being the only Person that ever brought
the Penny Post to Perfection) nor the faithful Discharge of
my Trust while Comptroller thereof, were sufficient to protect
me against those Artifices too often made use of to remove
useful and honest Men from publick Imployment: Nor have
I receiv'd any of the Pension formerly granted me these two
Years and half past. So that I hope the Impartial World
will consider the great Loss I and my Family have sustain'd,

</p>
    <p>In <date value="1711">1711</date> an act was passed abolishing the penny post, and
on June 23 of that year a proclamation was issued putting it
in force. A notice had previously appeared in the London
Gazette of June 12/14, assimilating all rates to those of the
General Post, although for  'the Accommodation of the
Inhabitants of such Places, their Letters will be convey'd with


<pb n="133" id="p.133"/>

the same Regularity and Dispatch as formerly, being first
Tax'd with the Rates, and Stamp'd with the Mark of the
General Post Office, and that all Parcels will likewise be
Tax'd at the Rate of One Shilling per Ounce as the said Act
directs.' </p>

    <p>In <date value="1709">1709</date> the Foreign and Inland Post Letter days were:-
     ' MONDAY. To Spain, Italy, Germany, Flanders, Denmark,
                 Sweedland, Downs and Kent.
    'TUESDAY. Germany, Holland, Sweedland, Denmark,
                 North Britain, Ireland and Wales.
    ' WEDNESDAY. Kent and the Downs.
    'THURSDAY. Spain, Italy, and all parts of North Britain
                 and England.
    'FRIDAY. Italy, Germany, Flanders, Kent, Holland,
                 Sweedland, Denmark and Downs.
    'SATURDAY. All parts of Wales, North Britain, England,
                 and Ireland.</p>

    <p>'Letters return from all parts of England and North
 Britain, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; from Wales,
 Mondays and Fridays, from Kent and the Downs every day;
 but from beyond Sea uncertain.</p>
    <p>'The Carriage is 2d. a Sheet 80 Miles, double 4d. and 8d.
 an Ounce for more than Letters. All Letters more than 80
 Miles is 3d. Single and 6d. Double Pacquet 12d. an Ounce.
 A Letter to Dublin 6d. Single, Double 1/ and 1/6 an
 Ounce.' </p>
    <p>Foreign postage was not so very dear. In <date value="1705">1705</date>, for
instance, a letter of a single sheet could be carried to the West
Indies for 1s./3d. and 2 sheets for 2/6; whilst from thence
to England it was respectively 1/6 and 3/, or by weight
6/ per oz.</p>
    <p>In <date value="1708">1708</date> Mr. Povey established a foot post-carrying
letters, in the London district only, for one halfpenny. How
long he kept it up does not seem clear; the Post Office
authorities stopped him; but there is an advertisement
referring to it in the <hi rend="italics">Daily Courant</hi> of July 4, <date value="1710">1710</date>:  'Whereas
a Person in some Distress sent a letter by the Halfpenny

<pb n="134" id="p.134"/>

Carriage on Monday night last,'  etc., and this clearly shows
it was in existence at that date.</p>
    <p>The Gazette Nov. 29/Dec. I, <date value="1709">1709</date>, has the following
Advertisement:  'Whereas Charles Povey and divers Traders
and Shop Keepers in and about the Cities of London and
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, Borough of Southwark and Parts adjacent, and
several Persons ringing Bells about the Streets of the said
Cities and Borough, have set up, imploy'd, and for sometime
continued a Foot Post for Collecting and Delivering Letters
within the said Cities and Borough, and Parts adjoining, for
Hire under the Name of the Halfpenny Carriage. Contrary
to the Known Laws of this Kingdom, and to the great
Prejudice of her Majesty's Revenues arising by Posts; her
Majesty's Postmaster General has therefore directed
Informations in her Majesty's Court of Exchequer, to be exhibited
against the said Charles Povey, and several Shop Keepers
and Ringers of Bells, for Recovery against every of them of
&#x00A3;pound;pound;100 for such setting up, and for every week's continuance
thereof; and also &#x00A3;pound;pound;5 for every Offence in Collecting and
Delivering of Letters for Hire as aforesaid, contrary to the
Statute for erecting and establishing a Post Office.' </p>
   <p>These additions to the rate of postage, of course, induced
people to look after franks-the granting of which, however,
had not assumed anything like the proportions it did later on.</p>
  <p> But there was not the hurrying and driving in business
then as now. Men lived over their shops or counting houses,
and, being easily accessible, did their work in a deliberate,
leisurely manner, and began their business very early in the
day. For instance, when Sir William Withers, Lord Mayor in
<date value="1707">1707</date>, was putting up for a seat in Parliament, he adduced,
as showing he would have time for his parliamentary duties,
that  'There is not above one Cause in a Day
throughout the whole Year, to be Heard after Ten a Clock in the
Morning.'  <note place="foot" n="3"><hi rend="italics">Daily Courant</hi>, October 30, <date value="1707">1707</date>.</note> 'Change was earlier than now;  'Crowds of

whole World's Map which you may here discern in its
perfectest Motion, justling and turning. 'Tis a vast heap of
Stones, and the confusion of Languages makes it resemble
Babel. The Noise in it is like that of Bees; a strange
Humming or Buzzing, of walking tongues and feet; it is a

Exchange of all Discourses, and no Business whatsoever but
is here on Foot. All things are sold here, and Honesty by
Inch of Candle; but woe be to the Purchaser, for it will never
thrive with him.' </p>
   <p>In the centre of the Exchange was a statue of <persName key="Charles II.">Charles II.</persName>,
and here the stock jobbers hovered about-when they
were not at Robin's or Jonathan's in Exchange Alley; and
all about, each under his own nationality, stood the trim
Italian, the Hollanders and Germans, with their slovenly
mien, and uncouth, unkempt beards and moustachios. The
Dons, in flat crowned hats and short cloaks, took snuff
prodigiously, and smelt terribly of garlic; there were the
lively Gauls, animated and chattering,  'ready to wound
every Pillar with their Canes, as they pass'd by, either in
Ters, Cart, or Saccoon.'  Jews of course, amber necklace
sellers from the Baltic in fur caps and long gowns, a
sprinkling of seedy military men, and the merchants. These
were the constituent parts of 'Change in those days, and it
must have been a sight worth seeing. Round about were
shops as now, where the spruce young Cits ogled the pretty
glove sellers, or bought a Steinkirk, or a sword knot.
Contemporary accounts of these fair damsels are not very good,
but it was rather a libellous or scurrilous age as regards
women, and they might not be true, or at all events be taken
with much salt.</p>

Pillars at the Entrance of the Front Porticum were adorn'd
with sundry Memorandums of old Age and Infirmity, under
which stood here and there a Jack in a Box, like a Parson in
a Pulpit, selling Cures for your Corns, Glass Eyes for the

costermongers without. The pillars of the Exchange were hung
round with advertisements, as indeed they were until very
recently.</p>
   <p>Some well-known names of bankers were then in
existence-Child's, Hoare's, Stone's, and Martin's. In <hi rend="italics">Harl.</hi> MSS.
5,996, 153 is a somewhat curious advertisement of Sir Richard
Hoare's.  'WHEREAS there hath been several false and
Malicious Reports industriously spread abroad reflecting on
Sir Richard Hoare, Goldsmith, for occasioning and promoting
a Run for Money on the Bank of England; and in particular,
several of the Directors of the said Bank reporting, That the
said Sir Richard sent to the Bank for Ten of their Notes of
&amp;pound;10 each, with a design to send several Persons with the said
Notes to receive the Money thereon, so as to effect his ill
Designs, and to bring a Disreputation on the Bank, and
occasion a Disturbance in the City of London:</p>
   <p>'This is to satisfie all Persons, That the Right Honourable
the Lord Ashburnham, Father of the Honourable Major
Ashburnham, Major of the First Troop of Her Majesty's Life
Guards, who was ordered to march for Scotland, sending to
the said Sir Richard Hoare for a large Quantity of Gold, and
for Ten Bank Notes of &#x00A3;pound;pound;10 each, for the said Major to take
with him to bear his Expenses. The Gold was sent to his
Lordship accordingly, and Sir Richard's Servant went to the
Bank for ten Notes of &#x00A3;pound;pound;10 each, which the Cashier of the
Bank refus'd to give: But if Sir Richard had intended to
promote a Run for Mony on the Bank, he could have done it
in a more effectual manner, having by him, all the time that
the great demand for Mony was on the Bank, several Thousand
Pounds in Notes payable by the Bank; and also there was
brought to Sir Richard by several Gentlemen, in the time of
the Run on the Bank, Notes payable by the said Bank,



<pb n="137" id="p.137"/>

amounting to a great many Thousands of Pounds, which he
was desir'd to take and receive the Mony presently from the
Bank, which he refus'd to do until the great Demand on the
Bank for Money was over.</p>
   <p>'N.B. That the Reports against Sir Richard have been
more Malicious than herein is mention'd, which he forbears
to insert for brevity's sake.' </p>
   <p><persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName>, for some reason, disliked bankers: he says, ' What
methods do they take now to improve their Cash? The
chief advantage they now make is by supplying the
Necessities of straiten'd Merchants and great Dealers, to pay (for)
the Goods imported, rather than they should fall under the
Discredit as well as Disadvantage of being run into the
King's Ware House, or by assisting of 'em in the purchase
of great Bargains, or the like; for which they make 'em pay
such unreasonable extortion, that they devour more of the
Merchants Profit than Snails, Worms or Magpies, do of the
Farmers Crop, or the Gardiner's Industry.'  If this was all
the fault he could find, their iniquities were not very glaring.</p>

<p>WE have seen the birth, marriage, and funeral of these good
people, and have noted some of their social habits. Next is,
how did they dress ? Far plainer than in Charles the Second's
time, rather richer than under solemn and austere Dutch
William, yet not nearly as finely as during the Georgian era.
That, of course, is speaking of ordinary mortals-neither the
titled ones of the land, who showed their rank by their
dress, nor the beaus, who formed no inconsiderable portion
of metropolitan life, and at whom were levelled stinging little
shafts of satire from all sides, mostly good-humoured. The
macaroni, the dandy, the buck, the blood, the swell-all are
fine, but the beau of Anne's time was superfine, and modelled
on the messieurs of the time of Louis XIV. He cannot be
dismissed in a few words, for he was an institution of the
time. There were travelled fops, and they were
hatedthere were those of home manufacture, and they were laughed
at. <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName> notes that  'A Beau is so much the more
remarkable in England, because generally speaking, the English
Men dress in a plain uniform manner,'  and he describes them
as  'Creatures compounded of a Perriwig and a Coat laden
with Powder as white as a Miller's, a Face besmear'd with
Snuff, and a few affected airs; they are exactly like Moliere's
Marquesses, and want nothing but that Title, which they
would infallibly assume in any other Country but England.'

the Women-He won't speak to a Gentleman when a Lord's

his Button, his Breast open, no Gloves, one Eye tuck'd under

with the Toothpick.</p>
   <p><persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName> naturally loves him-impales him on his
entomological pin-and enjoys his wriggles. He puts him under
his microscope and minutely observes him, and then gives us
the benefit of his description:  'A Beau is a Narcissus that is
fallen in Love with himself and his own Shadow. Within
Doors he is a great Friend to a great Glass, before which
he admires the Works of his Taylor more than the whole
Creation. His Body's but a Poor Stuffing of a Rich Case,
like Bran to a Lady's Pincushion; that when the outside
is stript off, there remains nothing that's Valuable. His
Head is a Fool's Egg, which lies hid in a Nest of Hair;
His Brains are the Yolk, which Conceit has Addled. He's a
stroling Assistant to Drapers and Taylors, showing every
other Day a New Pattern, and a New Fashion. He's a
Walking Argument against Immortality; For no Man by
his Actions, or his Talk can find he has more Soul than a
Goose. He's a very Troublesome Guest in a Tavern; and
must have good Wine chang'd three or four Times till they
bring him the worst in the Cellar, before he'll like it. His
Conversation is as intolerable as a young Councel's in Term
Time, Talking as much of his Mistresses, as the other does of
his Motions; and will have the most Words, tho' all he says
is nothing. He's a Bubble to all he deals with, even to his
Periwig Maker; and hates the sordid Rascal that won't
Flatter him. He scorns to condescend so low, as to speak of
any Person beneath the dignity of a Noble man; the Duke
of such a Place, and my Lord such one, are his common
Cronies, from whom he knows all the Secrets of the Court,
but dares not impart 'em to his best Friends, because the
Duke enjoyn'd him to Secrecie. He is always furnish'd with


<pb n="140" id="p.140"/>

new Jests from the last New Play, which he most commonly
spoiles with repeating. His Watch he compares with every
Sun Dial, Swears it corrects the Sun; and plucks it out
so frequently in Company, that his Fingers go oftener in a
Day to his Fob, than they do to his Mouth, spending more
time every Week in showing the Rarity of the Work, than
the Man did in making on't; being as forward to tell the
Price without desiring, as he is to tell you the Hour without
asking; he is a constant Visitor of a Coffee house, where he
Cons over the News Papers with much indifference; Reading
only for Fashion's sake and not for Information. He's
commonly of a small standing at one of the Universities, tho' all
he has learnt there, is to Know how many Taverns there are
in the Town, and what Vintner has the handsom'st Wife....
He's a Coward amongst Brave men, and a Brave fellow among
Cowards; a Fool amongst Wise men, and a Wit in Fool's
company.' </p>
   <p>Pretty hard hitting; but it is borne out on all hands.

  ' His first Care is his Dress, the
next his Body; and in the uniting these Two lies his Soul
and Faculties. His business is in the Side Box, the Stage,
and the Drawing Room; his Discourse consists of Dress,
Equipage, and the Ladies, and his extream Politeness in
writing Billet deux; which he never fails to shew in all
Companies. The nice Management of his Italian Snuff box, and
the affected Screw of his Body, makes up a great Part of his
Conversation, and the Pains he takes to recommend himself,
wou'd set Heraclitus a Laughing. He's perpetually Laughing
to shew his white Teeth, and is never serious but with his
Taylor. His whole Design is bent upon a Fortune, which if
he gets, the Coach and Equipage is still supported; if not
his fine Cloaths and he prove stale together, and he is

low crowned, made of felt, with very broad flapping

the wearer--and the absence of this cocking denoted a sloven.

Women's hair was a valuable commodity, judging by the
following:  'An Oxfordshire Lass was lately courted by a
young man of that County, who was not willing to marry her
unless her friends could advance &#x00A3;pound;pound;50 for her portion; which
they being incapable of doing, the lass came to this City to try
her fortune, when she met with a good Chapman in <placeName key="the Strand">the Strand</placeName>,

and light), and gave her sixty pounds for it, being 20 ounces at

Country and bought her a husband.' <note place="foot" n="10"><hi rend="italics">Protestant Mercury</hi>, July 10, <date value="1700">1700</date>.</note>
 Indeed, it was an
article of general purchase and sale:  'We came up to the

Money for Live Hair, upon a Barber's Window.'  <note place="foot" n="11"><hi rend="italics">London Spy</hi>.</note>

   <p>Men used to travel the country on horseback and collect
it, and it was not unfrequent for suspected highwaymen, when

one, if we can believe the advertisements for the apprehension
of deserters from the army:  'said he was a dealer in hair'

thereof was like to draw him from his seat ?' <note place="foot" n="14">The Levellers, a Dialogue.</note>
 And they must
have been heavy.  'His Wigg I believe had a pound of Hair
and two pounds of powder in't.' <note place="foot" n="15">The Gamesters.</note>
 And again, ' One Impudent

</p>
   <p>The furbelow, or dress wig, was sometimes called a
 'long Duvillier'  (see <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi> 29), from a famous French
perruquier of that name ; and these wigs were not only long, but
tall: vide the humorous advertisement in the <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi> (180):
 'N.B. Dancing Shoes, not exceeding four inches in height in
the heels, and periwigs not exceeding three feet in length,
are carried in the coach box gratis.'  Not to have it in
perfect curl was unendurable.  'I think standing in the Pillory
cannot be a more sensible Ignominy to a Gentleman that
wears tolerable Cloaths, than appearing in Publick with a
rumpled Periwig.' <note place="foot" n="17">The Gentleman Cully, ed. <date value="1702">1702</date>.</note>
 Pretty dears! they used to carry ivory or
tortoiseshell combs, curiously ornamented, with them, and
comb their precious wigs in public-ay, the most public
places-walking in the Park, or sitting in the Beau's
Paradise, the side box of the theatre, and when paying visits.
But it seems to have been in anybody's power, by the
exercise of a little trouble, to keep his wig in proper curl.

    <p>These wigs were expensive-that is, if <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName> and <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName>
do not exaggerate. Take this example from  the <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>,
No. 54.   ' He answered Phillis a little abruptly at supper the
same evening, upon which she threw his perriwig into the
fire. "Well," said he, " thou art a brave termagant jade; do
you know, hussy, that fair wig cost forty guineas ?" '  And
in the <hi rend="italics">Guardian</hi> (No. 97), ' This gave me some
encouragement; so that to mend the matter, I bought a fine flaxen
long wig that cost me thirty guineas.'  But there were wigs
and wigs, and probably these highly priced ones were
somewhat abnormal; at all events, ordinary people could not
have afforded them, for we find <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> loud in his laments
about paying three guineas for one.<note place="foot" n="19"><hi rend="italics">Journal to Stella</hi>, let. 13.</note>
 'It has cost me three guineas to day for a periwig. I am undone! It was made by
a Leicester lad, who married Mrs. Worrall's daughter, where
my mother lodged; so I thought it would be cheap, and
especially since he lives in the city.' </p>
    <p>It must not be imagined that the periwig was the only
 variety. On the contrary, there were several kinds of wig.
  'I had an humble Servant last Summer, who the first time
 he declared himself, was in a Full Bottom'd Wigg; but the
 Day after, to my no small Surprize, he accosted me in a thin
 Natural one. I received him, at this our second Interview,
 as a perfect Stranger, but was extreamly confounded, when
 his speech discovered who he was. I resolved, therefore, to
 fix his Face in my Memory for the future; but as I was
 walking in the Park the same Evening, he appeared to me in
 one of those Wiggs that I think you call a Night Cap, which
 had altered him more effectually than before. He afterwards



<pb n="146" id="p.146"/>

played a Couple of Black Riding Wiggs upon me, with the
same Success,' <note place="foot" n="20"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 319 (Budgell).
</note>etc. The  'Night Cap'  wig was a sort of
periwig, with a short tie and a small round head. Then there
was a  'Campaign'  wig, which was imported from France;
and this was made very full, was curled, and eighteen inches
in length in the front, with drop locks. In the contemporary
prints of Marlborough's victories, the back part of the wig
is sometimes shown as being put in a black silk bag. We
get an approximate idea of their value from the following
advertisement:  'Lost &amp;c. a Campaign Perriwig, fair Hair
with a large Curl, value about 7 guineas,'  etc.</p>
   <p>I have come across one mention of a  'Spanish Wigg,'
but as this was worn by a runaway ship's apprentice, it was
probably of foreign manufacture, and the species had no
place here. Lastly, there was the  'Bob'  wig, or attempt to
imitate the natural head of hair. This wig was mostly in use
among the lower orders; and many are the descriptions of
it, and its various colours, in the advertisements for army
deserters. But the better class also used it. We have seen,
in the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 319, how a man wore  'a thin Natural'
wig; so also we read in <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>'s  '<hi rend="italics">Lying Lover</hi>,'   'What shall I
do for powder for this smart Bob ?' </p>
   <p>The proper quality, and quantity, of his powder, must have
been a serious weight upon the mind of a beau. Its
groundwork, or basis, was starch, very finely ground and sifted; but
this was adulterated with burnt alabaster, plaster of Paris
(which was called in the trade Old Doctor), whitening, fine
flour, flour from pearl barley, and other things; and it was
scented-well, we should think to a sickening degree-with
ambergris, musk and civet, violets, orris root, rose, bergamot,
orange flowers, and jessamine.  And there were different
coloured hair powders. The black was made with starch,
Japan ink, and ivory black; a cheaper sort was made of
pounded coal-dust. Brown was made with starch and umber
-according to the shade required. Grey was produced by
mixing some of the black powder with more starch, and
adding a little smalts.</p>

   <p>This was an ingenious plan, but it was almost equalled in
the very early years of George I. by a practice which sprung
up, of cutting a hole in the leather backs of the carriages,
boldly clutching the occupant's wig, and dragging it through
the hole.</p>
   <p>Some few had the courage to wear their own hair, and
here is a hairdresser's advertisement on the subject: <note place="foot" n="23"><hi rend="italics">Harl.</hi> MSS. <date value="5931">5931</date>, 242.</note>
 'Next door to the Golden Bell in St. Bride's Lane <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>,

Gentlemen's, and   Childrens  Hair; and    selleth  a fine

of those days were very similar to their congeners of ours,
and had invaluable nostrums- 'prepared only by,'  etc.
Bear's grease used to be imported from Russia; but a
spurious kind was also sold, made out of dog's, or goat's, fat,
or rancid hog's lard. There were common, hard, black, and
brown pomatums, to say nothing of powders and liquids for
thickening the hair, principally made of burdock root and
small beer, and a powder for cleansing the hair, made with
cassia wood and white vitriol.</p>



<pb n="148" id="p.148"/>

   <p>We next come to the neckcloth, as no collar or band of
the shirt was shown; and the one most in fashion was the
 'Steinkirk,'  so called from the battle of that name, which was
fought on Aug 3, <date value="1692">1692</date>, when the English under William III.
were defeated, and the campaign broken up. This style of
neckcloth was introduced from  Paris, and it was highly
fashionable there, because its negligent style was popularly
supposed to imitate the disordered dress of the victorious
French generals, who were so eager to rush into the fight that
they did not stop to finish dressing-or, at all events, to tie
their neckcloths. It was a very graceful fashion, and the ends,
which were laced or fringed, were sometimes tucked in the
waistcoat or shirt. They are frequently alluded to as  'snuff
grimed.'   Ladies also wore them, as in  'The Careless
Husband'  Lady Easy  'takes her Steinkirk from her Neck
and lays it gently over his Head.' </p>
   <p>And there was the  'Berdash.'   'I have prepared a treatise
against the Cravat and berdash, which I am told is not ill
done.'  <note place="foot" n="24"><hi rend="italics">Guardian</hi>, No. 10.</note>
 Some have imagined that the word haberdasher is
derived from this neckcloth, but it is too ridiculous to think
of for a moment, as there were haberdashers as early as
Edward the Third's reign, and at the time of which we write
there were  'haberdashers of hats.'   In the epilogue to
<persName key="Centlivre,Susannah">Mrs. Centlivre</persName>'s  'Platonick Lady,'   'design'd to be spoken by
Mrs. Bracegirdle but came too late,'  it is mentioned-
     <quote rend="blockquote">Yet, tell me, Sirs, don't you as nice appear

<p>The <hi rend="italics">Daily Courant</hi>, Nov. 4, <date value="1708">1708</date>, says:  'Also very fine
Muslin Neckcloths to be sold at 5s. a Piece.' </p>
  <p>A gentleman's shirt was of fine holland, and was
somewhat dear-the fronts were worn very open, and the ruffles were
not laced, at least for ordinary wear: this piece of
extravagance was reserved for a later time. Showing so much of the
shirt necessitated clean linen, but it is hardly likely that
many followed the example of Tom Modely, <note place="foot" n="26"><hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, No. 166.</note>
whose  'business in this world is to be well dressed; and the greatest



<pb n="149" id="p.149"/>

circumstance that is to be recorded in his annals is that he
wears twenty shirts a week.'  That they were costly, we may
judge from the fact that <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> was not extravagant in his
dress, and that he bought them first-hand in Holland, by
means of his friend Harrison, who was under great
obligations to him.   '28 Feb. <date value="1718">1718</date>. I have sent to Holland for a
dozen shirts,' <note place="foot" n="27"><hi rend="italics">Journal to Stella</hi>.</note>
 etc.-and again he writes:  'Jan. 31, <date value="1713">1713</date>. I
paid him (Harrison) while he was with me seven guineas, in
part of a dozen of shirts he bought me in Holland.' </p>
   <p>This having the waistcoat unbuttoned to show the shirt
is very frequently mentioned, but it was eminently a young
man's practice. A lady, speaking of her husband, says:
 ' You must know, he tells me that he finds London is a much
more healthy place than the Country; for he sees several of
his old acquaintance and schoolfellows are here young fellows
with fair full-bottomed perriwigs. I could scarce keep him
this morning from going out open breasted.' <note place="foot" n="28"><hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, No. 95.</note>
  Again <note place="foot" n="29"><hi rend="italics">Ibid.</hi> 246.  </note>
:  'There is a fat fellow whom I have long remarked, wearing his
breast open in the midst of winter, out of an affectation of
youth. I have therefore sent him just now the following
letter in my physical capacity:-</p>

   <p>' "Sir,
         "'From the twentieth instant to the first of May
next, both days inclusive, I beg of you to button your
waistcoat from your collar to your waistband." '
It was supposed to have a most killing effect on the fair
sex.  'A sincere heart has not made half so many
conquests as an open waistcoat.' <note place="foot" n="30"><hi rend="italics">Ibid.</hi> 151.</note>
 The waistcoats, otherwise,
were seldom mentioned; they were long, but not so long as
they afterwards became; and, with the exception of very fine
suits, seem to have been quite plain. One or two
advertisements of fine clothes will tell us a great deal about them
 'Lost &amp;c.-a Red Waistcoat Wove in with Gold, 2 Cravats,

day to see his brother who lived but a day's journey from

portmanteaus. On his arrival, these were unpacked, and three
suits of clothes, each finer than the other, were displayed on
chairs, his nightgown on another, and his shaving plate all
put out. Next morning he appeared at breakfast with his
boots on, and his brother asked him where he was going for
a ride before dinner. He replied that he was going home;
that he had only just come to see him, and must go back at
once, which he did. The poor man afterwards died mad in

the coats used to be wired to make them stick out.  'The

   <p>The cheap clothiers lived in Monmouth Street, St. Giles,
(now called Dudley Street), and there was no love lost
between them and their higher-priced brethren, as the following
advertisement shows:  'Whereas the Monmouth Street Men
and other Taylors in and about the City, have by divers
Advertisements in the <hi rend="italics">Postman</hi> and other publick Prints, and by

 In reading these
advertisements, and indeed in all quotations of price, the
different value of money-then and now-should never be
forgotten; three pounds being equivalent to seven or eight. So
that, according to our ideas, clothing was dearer then than now.</p>
   <p>In the country, owing to the very little correspondence
between it and the metropolis, of course the fashions were
some time in reaching remote distances, and were equally
long in departing from thence, to make way for new ones.
<persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName> humorously describes the fashions for men in
Cornwall in <date value="1711">1711</date> .  ' From this place, during our progress through
the most western parts of the kingdom, we fancied ourselves
in King Charles the Second's reign, the people having made
vary little variations in their dress since that time. The
smartest of the country Squires appear still in the Monmouth
Cock, and when they go a wooing, whether they have any
post in the militia or not, they generally put on a red coat.
We were indeed very much surprised, at the place we lay at
last night, to meet with a gentleman that had accoutred
himself in a night cap wig, a coat with long pockets and slit
sleeves, and a pair of shoes with high scallop tops; but we
soon found by his conversation that he was a person who
laughed at the ignorance and rusticity of the country people,
and was resolved to live and die in the mode.' <note place="foot" n="36"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, 129.</note>

   <p>Of men's breeches, and the materials of which they were
made, very little mention is made; but the stocking is
frequently brought to notice. They were of cloth, knitted
woollen, thread, and silk. The latter were of all colours, to
suit the beaus' costumes, but black silk was the wear of your
well-to-do citizen, professional man, or gentleman. <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName>
says  'The English Silk Stockings are one of its famous

                and clumsy riding-boot of William the Third's
                time, which was still worn by Marlborough
                and his cavalry. Many are the pairs, with
                their spurs, that are advertised for, as being
                left in coaches.</p>
                   <p>In those days of bad pavements and
               defective sewage, when men had hardly begun
               the general use of the chair, and a coach was,
               as now, the luxury of the few, shoeblacks were
               a necessity; and, although a man might, like
the Templar in  'Sir Roger de Coverley,'   'have his shoes rubbed
and his periwig powdered at the Barber's, as you go unto the
Rose,'  yet a large number of  'Black Youth at chosen Stands
rejoice; and Clean your Shoes resounds from ev'ry Voice.'
They were very numerous; and from them is derived our
word blackguard, for so were they called about Charing
Cross and White Hall.</p>
   <p>There were different kinds of blacking, but, judging from
the dispraise awarded to each other's goods by rival
manufacturers, they could have been neither pleasant nor effective.
 'London Fucus for Shoes; being an unparallel'd
Composition of the most pure and rich Blacks, Choice Oils, &amp;c., and
is a thing so adapted to this Use, that the World never yet
produc'd the like Invention, having gain'd a General Applause,



<pb n="155" id="p.155"/>

causing the straitest Shooes to wear with delight and
ease; beautifies them to admiration, preserves the Leather
from cracking or rotting to the very last; and frees the Feet
from all Pains, Corns, Swellings, &amp;c. . . . Price 12d. a Roll.
Note, one Roll serves one Person near half a year.'  And
then the famous  'Spanish Blacking'  advertised, and called
the poor  ' Fucus '  names.</p>
   <p>The little odds and ends of male attire must be noted.
Gloves, for instance, were in constant use, and we have seen
how prodigally they were given away at funerals. The ire
of the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> was aroused by a custom,
then just brought up, of edging them with
silver fringe, but this luxurious practice
does not seem to have obtained for very
long.</p>
   <p>The pocket-handkerchiefs, owing to the
prevalence of the <figure id="fig.27" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00027"><head>SHOE-BLACK.</head></figure>
practice of snuff-taking, were
nearly always of silk,
though cambric was used;
and although we do not
hear of  'Moral
Pockethandkerchiefs,'  they were
somewhat similarly
utilised, as the following advertisement shows:  'A Silk
Handkerchief Printed, with a Draught of the Roads of England
according to Mr. Ogleby's Survey, shewing the Roads and distance in
measured Miles from London to the several Cities and Towns
in England. Also the Victory Handkerchief, which gives an
account of the Success of 5 most glorious Victories obtain'd
by the Confederates over the French. Ornamented with the
Arms of the Empire and Great Britain, Prussia and Holland:
They will both Wash in a weak Lather of Soap without
Prejudice.  Price 2s. 6d.'   Others were printed with the
Queen's Speech to Parliament, April 5, 171O; the standards
and ensigns taken from the French, with the queen's effigies
at full length; Dr. Sacheverell and the six bishops who voted
with him; the four seasons of the year with the sun in the
centre, curiously ornamented; and the last one I can find
<pb n="156" id="p.156"/>

advertised in Anne's reign was one printed on white silk with
 'An Abstract of the Peace made between England and
France, with the lively Effigies of all the Confederates,
Princes and the several Plenipotentiaries at Utrecht.' </p>
   <p>In the early part of Anne's reign it was fashionable for
men to wear muffs, as it had been ever since Charles the
Second's time. <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName> (<date value="1703">1703</date>) says:  ' What is he in the long
Whig, with his Fox skin Muff upon his Button, and his
Pocket book in his Hand? Why he (replied my
schoolfellow) is a Beau.'   But they seem to have become less
popular in <date value="1710">1710</date> (vide <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, No. 155).  'I saw he was
reduced to extreme poverty, by certain shabby superfluities
in his dress: for, notwithstanding that it was a very sultry
day for the time of the year, he wore a loose great Coat
and a Muff,'  etc.  Yet in <date value="1711">1711</date> <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName> writes (<hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>,
No. 16):  'I have receiv'd a Letter, desiring me to be very
satyrical upon the little Muff that is now in Fashion.' </p>
   <p>Every gentleman carried a sword, and we are able to get
accurate descriptions of them, from the very numerous
descriptions of them in the advertisements of lost and stolen
swords-how they used to lose them ! Probably the company
at the tavern or club was jovial, the claret good, and the way
home was badly lit, and in the morning the silver-hilted
sword was a-missing. I wonder if they ever got them back ?
They cried after them loudly enough, although they did not
offer great rewards, a guinea or so at the outside. <persName key="Gay,John">Gay</persName> thus
warns the walker in the streets:-

           <quote rend="blockquote">Where the Mob gathers, swiftly shoot along,
           Nor idly mingle in the noisy Throng.
           Lur'd by the Silver Hilt, amid the Swarm,
           The subtil Artist will thy Side disarm.</quote>

With a beau, his sword, as every other part of his dress,
received his special attention, and he very seldom was without
it, except when dancing.  His sword-knot was of some gay
colour, and was very long; and he was solicitous as to the
carriage of his sword. ' But my sword-does it hang
careless?'  asks Bookwit in the  '<hi rend="italics">Lying Lover</hi>' ; and yet withal
the hilts very seldom seem to have been of much value, either



<pb n="157" id="p.157"/>

diamond-cut steel, gilt, or plain silver hilts. The following
are some of the better sort, and of the most artistic merit.
 ' A large plain Silver hilted Sword with Scrowls and gilt in
parts, with a broad gutter'd hollow Blade gilt at the shoulder,
and the edges ground very sharp and a strong silver gilt
handle.' 'A Hanger with a fine Aggat Haft, Belt, and Silver
buckle.' 'A Silver gilt Sword, done with several Figures,
with a Chequer Gold handle done one half of it with a Black
Ribbon.' 'A Silver and Gold Hilted Sword wrought with
Figures and Images about the handle, being tyed with a
broad black Ribbon, the Blade broad from the Hilt halfway,
and stain'd with blew and Gold.' ' A Silver and Gold hilted
Sword of a Trophy Pattern, with a man on Horseback on the
Middle of the Pommel, and the same in the Shell, with the
Figures lying down on each side of the Horse, the Button of
the Pommel being in Squares. '</p>
   <p>Here is an advertisement which shows how a poor
innocent was led astray:  'June 24, <date value="1712">1712</date>. Whereas a Gentleman
coming to Bradbery's Hazard Table last Night, and not a
Gamester, but brought by an Acquaintance to see the Nature
of it, lost his Silver hilted Sword, which some of the Company
took from his side; This is to give Notice that any body that
produces the Sword to Mr. John Waters, Perfumer, in the
Strand, over against the Talbot Inn; or to Mr. Hosier, over
against the Bunch of Grapes in New Street, Fetter Lane,
shall have 10s. Reward, and no Questions ask'd; and if the
Sword is not produc'd, the Man that keeps the Table will be
indited.' </p>
   <p>Towards the end of Anne's reign swords were worn of a
preposterous length, which excited the satire of the <note place="foot" n="39"><hi rend="italics">Guardian</hi>, No. 143.</note>
 'When Jack Lizard made his first trip to town from the
university, he thought he could never bring up with him
enough of the gentleman; this I soon perceived in the first
visit he made me, when I remember, he came scraping in at
the door, encumbered with a bar of Cold iron so irksomely
long, that it banged against his Calf, and jarred upon his
right heel, as he Walked, and came rattling behind him as he
ran down the stairs. But his sister Annabella's raillery soon

<pb n="158" id="p.158"/>

cured him of this awkward air, by telling him that his sword
was only fit for going up stairs, or walking up hill, and that
she shrewdly suspected he had stolen it out of the College
kitchen.' </p>
   <p>Equal, at least, in importance to the sword, was the cane,
 ' the nice conduct'  of which was part of a gentleman's
education-and, if swords were plentifully lost or stolen, how many
more despairing owners mourned their canes? There were
useful, as well as ornamental canes.
         <quote rend="blockquote">If the Strong Cane support thy walking Hand,
         Chairmen no longer shall the Wall command;
         Ev'n sturdy Car-men shall thy Nod obey,
         And rattling Coaches stop to make thee Way:
         This shall direct thy Cautious Tread aright,
         Though not one glaring Lamp enliven Night.
         Let Beaus their Canes with Amber tipt produce,
         Be theirs for empty Show, but thine for use.</quote> <note place="foot" n="40"><hi rend="italics">Trivia</hi>, book 1.</note>


The majority of those lost were hardly worth advertising
for; but we will pick out a few, as specimens of what the
better sort were like:  'A fine Cane with a Gold Head,
engraved with a Cypher and Crown on the top of it.' 'A Cane
with an Aggot head.' 'A small cane with an Amber head
and a Black Silk Ribbond in it, a Princes Metal Hoop, and a
Silver Ferril at the bottom.' 'A Cane with a Silver Head
and a Black Ribbon in it, the top of it Amber, crack'd in two
or three places, part of the Head to turn round, and in it a
Perspective Glass.' 'A Cane with a croched Head, a Silver
Ferrel and a Silver ring.' 'A Cane with a Silver Head, with
the Figure of the Tower of Babel upon it, done in Chaced
Work.' 'A Cane with a Silver Head and Scent Box, and a
Ferril of Silver at the Bottom.' </p>
   <p>His snuff-box, too, was an object of his solicitude, though,
as the habit of taking snuff had but just come into vogue,
there were no collections of them, and no beau had ever
dreamed of criticising a box as did Lord Petersham, as  'a
nice Summer box.'  So many of them have come down to us
that they need no description, and I may merely say that
those of the middle classes were chiefly of silver, or tortoise-shell,



<pb n="159" id="p.159"/>

or mother-of-pearl; sometimes of  'Aggat' -or with a
 'Moco Stone'  in the lid. A beau would sometimes either
have a looking-glass, or the portrait of a lady inside
the lid.</p>
    <p>We have seen how proud the beau was of his watch, which
he wore in a fob, or pocket, in his breeches. A seal or two,
generally of small value, and a watch key, were attached to
it by a ribbon; chains, either of gold, silver, or steel, being
sparingly used. The seals, of course, were then necessary,
as, there being no gummed envelopes, every letter had to be
properly sealed, either by wax or wafer. Tompion was the
great watch-maker, and he lived at<figure id="fig.28" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00028"><head>A WATCH RIBAND.</head></figure>
the Three Crowns, at the corner of
Water Lane in <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, where he
was afterwards succeeded by George
Graham. The value of Tompion's
watches may be gathered from the
fact that from seven to ten guineas
were generally offered for their
recovery when lost, or from eighteen to
twenty-five guineas of our money.</p>
   <p>The watch of that day, and indeed
of the whole Georgian era, consisted of
the watch proper, and an outer
ornamental case, which was lined with a
pad of coloured velvet or satin, to
make it fit tight to the watch. We
now never see watch-cases made of
other materials than the precious metals, or imitations thereof;
but then, beautiful cases were made of shagreen of various
colours, or tortoiseshell inlaid, or studded, with gold. Some
beautiful specimens may be seen in the library of the
Corporation of the City of London, in the Clockmakers'
Company's collection.</p>
   <p>As umbrellas were not used by men, as being too
effeminate, and india-rubber waterproofing was only to be
discovered more than a century later, men, in Anne's
reign, had to put their trust in good broadcloth coats or
cloaks.</p>

    <p>Scarlet seems to have been the favourite colour for the
roquelaure or cloak, and some must have been  'exceeding

   <p>In doors, in their hours of ease, the precious furbelow wig
was discarded, and their closely cropped or shaved heads
were clad in handsomely worked caps-called night caps,
although only worn in the daytime; some kind of night cap
having been an article of dress ever since the time of
Elizabeth. They were as common presents from ladies to
gentlemen, as a pair of slippers, or a smoking-cap would be now.
Says <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName>,  'Your fine Cap, Madam Dingley, is too little, and
too hot. I will have that fur taken off; I wish it were far

costly materials as well as  'Callicoe' ; indeed, they were
generally of brocade, or some embroidered material. Men

    <p>It is hardly within the scope of this work to follow the
varying fashions of the reign, so one more extract must
suffice.  It is from  'The Humours of the Army,'  by Charles
Shadwell (a son, or nephew, of the Poet Laureate, <date value="1713">1713</date>):
 ' But there are some fashionable Creatures at the other End
of the Town, that give great Hopes of their being very odd

<pb n="166" id="p.166"/>

and Whimsical; for their Head dresses are no bigger than
the Skull-caps they us'd to wear; their Petticoats are up to
their knees; their Stays up to their chins; and their Fans
up to their Nostrils; and the mody Shrug makes 'em wear
their Shoulders up to their Ears; their Lappets reach down
to the Frenching of their Petticoats, which are widen'd with
Abundance of Whalebone; They stoop forward when they
should walk upright; they shuffle along a tip Toe, curtsey
on one Side, smile on those they would ridicule, and look
very grave on their intimate acquaintances.'

   <p>Before its introduction, women to improve their figures,
or to follow the fashion, wore false hips, but these speedily
disappeared when the hooped petticoat made its appearance,
about <date value="1709">1709</date>. <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName> wrote a very funny paper, a mock trial
of it, <note place="foot" n="6"><hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, 116.</note>
in which the arguments for and against are duly heard,
and he winds up his judgment with  'I consider women as a
beautiful romantic animal, that may be adorned with furs and
feathers, pearls and diamonds, ores and silks. The lynx
shall cast its skin at her feet to make her a tippet; the
peacock, parrot and swan shall pay contribution to her muff, the
sea shall be searched for shells, and the rocks for gems; and
every part of nature furnish out its share towards the
embellishment of a creature that is the most consummate work
of it. All this I shall indulge them in; but as for the
petticoat I have been speaking of, I neither can nor will allow it.'
Vain, idle words! the fashion crept on, until under the Georges
it was absolutely outrageous. At present it was a somewhat
mild hooping of whalebone, compressible-at least such was
the under framework; for the word petticoat meant the skirt
of the dress-over which was the furbelow. They were made
of varied and rich materials; one example will serve to
illustrate:  ' Stolen &amp;c. A Cloth Colour Gown and Petticoat
of Grazet, an Ash Coloured Grazet Gown and Petticoat, a





<pb n="167" id="p.167"/>

Hair Colour plush Petticoat, a black Russel Petticoat flower'd,
an Ash colour Silk Quilted Petticoat, a Cloth Colour'd Silk
Sattinet Gown and Petticoat,'  &amp;c.</p>
   <p>The bodices were laced, open in front, over very tight
stays, showing them; and they varied in material from  'a
pair of stays cover'd with Black Tabby Stitched, lin'd with
Flannel,'  to one  'with 8 diamond Buckles and Tags,'  for
which Sir Richard Hoare, of the Golden Bottle in Fleet
Street, would give the finder twelve guineas. The bodices
were worn low, showing the bosom-which, however, was
partially concealed by the  ' tucker'  or  'modesty piece,'  which
was an edging going round the top of the dress and front of
the bosom. In <date value="1713">1713</date> this was beginning to be discontinued,
and deep, and many, were the growls over it in the <hi rend="italics">Guardian</hi>.</p>
   <p>The sleeves of the bodice were somewhat short (only
coming a little below the bend of the arm), and were worn
hanging, to show the white muslin, or lace, hanging sleeve,
which came nearly to the wrist-a very pretty fashion; and
an apron was worn, made somewhat ornamental by
frilling, etc.</p>
   <p>This formed the outward costume of a lady; only
sometimes it was of extremely rich material, vide the following:

   <p>Of ladies' underlinen we get a glimpse in the following:

   <p>The stockings were either of thread or silk; in the latter
case they were sometimes of bright colours. We have already
seen how the little temptress of the New Exchange asked,
<quote rend="blockquote">' Does not your Lady want . . . fine green Silk Stockings?'</quote>
The shoes were beautifully made, of satin or silk, embroidered,
or of fine Morocco leather, with high heels.</p>
   <p>Oddly enough, even in those days, which we are
somehow inclined to clothe in idyllic simplicity, women dressed
like men, as far as they could. Budgell notes this: <quote rend="blockquote">'They

a cap or commode was

  <p><persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName> notes the difference between his countrywomen
and ours.  'The Use of Patches is not unknown to the





<pb n="171" id="p.171"/>

French Ladies; but she that wears them must be young and
handsome. In England, young, old, handsome, ugly, all are
bepatch'd till they are Bed-rid. I have often counted fifteen
Patches or more upon the swarthy wrinkled Phiz of an old
Hag threescore and ten, and upwards. Thus the English
Women refine upon our Fashions.' </p>
    <p>One would hardly imagine that this fashion could have
been pressed into the service of party passion, but so it was,
if <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName> was not jesting-and, after all, perhaps it is not
so astonishing, when we recollect that the Tory ladies stayed
away from the Queen's Drawing Room-on her Majesty's
birthday too-because she gave a flattering reception, and a
costly sword, to Prince Eugene:  'About the Middle of last
Winter I went to see an Opera at the Theatre in the
Haymarket, where I could not but take notice of two Parties of
very fine Women, that had placed themselves in the opposite
Side Boxes, and seemed drawn up in a kind of Battle Array
one against another. After a short Survey of them, I found
they were Patch'd differently; the Faces on one Hand being
spotted on the right Side of the Forehead, and those upon
the other, on the Left. I quickly perceived that they cast
Hostile Glances upon one another; and that their Patches
were placed in those different Situations, as Party Signals to
distinguish Friends from Foes. In the Middle Boxes,
between these two opposite Bodies, were several Ladies who
Patched indifferently on both Sides of their Faces, and seem'd
to sit there with no other Intention but to see the Opera.
Upon Inquiry I found that the Body of Amazons on my
right Hand were Whigs, and those on my Left, Tories: And
that those who had placed themselves in the Middle Boxes
were a Neutral Party, whose Faces had not yet declared
themselves.  These last however, as I afterwards found,
diminished daily, and took their Party with one Side or the
Other; insomuch that I observed in several of them, the
Patches, which were before dispersed equally, are now all gone
over to the Whig or Tory side of the Face.' <note place="foot" n="14"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, 81.</note></p>
   <p>It has been noticed that masks were used in the country
by ladies when taking horse exercise; in fact, it was a sub-


<pb n="172" id="p.172"/>

stitute for the modern veil; and, in previous reigns, it had
been used generally out of doors. But in Anne's time it had
got to be associated with disreputable females, so much so
that at concerts, and at Powel's puppet show, no person
wearing a mask was admitted. They were still worn at the
theatres, but scarcely by ladies. Still they were worn
sometimes even by them, on the first night of a play, in case there
might be any allusion, which might afterwards be excised,
which would make them blush. They were not expensive
luxuries.</p>

 'a round Sable Tippet, about 2 yards long, the Sable pretty

   <p>To anyone interested in the use of the fan at this period,
a perusal of <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName>'s article in the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> (No. 102) is
recommended: it is too long for reproduction here, and

from it. They seem to have been seldom lost, or if so, were
not of sufficient value to advertise-in fact, I have only met
with one advertisement,  'A painted Landskip Fann, cutt,
gilded Sticks,'  and for this a reward of 7s. 6d. was offered.
That they were largely imported is evident by the following
notice:  'For Sale by the Candle, at the Marine Coffee House
in Birchin Lane &amp;c.-Forty Thousand Fans of Sundry
Sorts;'  but these most probably were either Chinese,
Japanese, or Indian palm fans.</p>
    <p>Before closing the subject of women's costumes the  'Mob'
must be noticed-that dress of which <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> writes:  'The
ladies were all in Mobs; how do you call it ?-undressed.'  <note place="foot" n="25"><hi rend="italics">Journal to Stella</hi>, letter 11 .</note>

This negligent costume, of which no actual contemporary
description seems to exist, is never mentioned except to be
decried-as, for instance, the question is asked,  'How is a
man likely to relish his wife's society when he comes home
and finds her slovenly, in a Mob?'  And there were one or
two other articles of dress not usually mentioned, and not
described, as  'Women's laced Head Cloaths commonly called
Quaker's Pinners'  and  'Dowds.' </p>
   <p>What woman could exist without shopping nowadays ?
And the habit was the same among the ladies of Queen
Anne's time. The Female <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi> (<date value="1709">1709</date>) gives us the
following graphic description of shopping:  'This afternoon
some ladies, having an opinion of my fancy in Cloaths,
desired me to accompany them to Ludgate Hill, which I
take it to be as agreeable an amusement as a lady can pass
away three or four hours in. The shops are perfect gilded
theatres, the variety of wrought silks so many changes of fine
scenes, and the Mercers are the performers in the Opera;
and instead of <foreign lang="LA">"vivitur ingenio,"</foreign> you have in gold capitals
 "No trust by retail."  They are the sweetest, fairest, nicest,
dished out creatures; and by their elegant and soft speeches,
you would guess them to be Italians. As people glance
within their doors, they salute them with-Garden silks,
ladies, Italian Silks, brocades, tissues, cloth of Silver, or cloth
of Gold, very fine Mantua Silks, any right Geneva velvet,
English velvet, velvet embossed. And to the meaner sort-

<pb n="177" id="p.177"/>

Fine thread satins both striped and plain, fine mohair silk,
satinnets, burdets, Persianets, Norwich Crapes, anterines,
silks for hoods and scarves, hair camlets, druggets or
sagathies, gentlemen's nightgowns ready made, shallons, durances,
and right Scotch plaids. </p>
    <p>'We went into a shop which had three partners; two of
them were to flourish out their silks; and after an obliging
smile and a pretty mouth made, Cicero like, to expatiate on
their goodness; and the other's sole business was to be
gentleman usher of the shop, to stand completely dressed
at the door, bow to all the coaches that pass by, and hand
ladies out and in.</p>
    <p>'We saw abundance of gay fancies, fit for Sea Captain's
wives, Sheriff's feasts, and Taunton dean ladies. <note place="foot" n="26">Why <hi rend="italics">Taunton dean ladies</hi> I am at a loss to say, unless, as Somersetshire was
then considered as the  'ultima Thule'  of civilisation, it is meant that the dresses
were as fine and gaudy as a country belle would wear, in contradistinction to the
better taste of her town-bred sister.</note> This,
Madam, is wonderfully charming. This, Madam, is so
diverting a Silk. This, Madam-my stars! how cool it
looks.  But this, Madam.-Ye Gods! would I had 10,000
yards of it! Then gathers up a sleeve, and places it to your
shoulders. It suits your Ladyship's face wonderfully well.
When we had pleased ourselves, and bid him ten shillings a
yard for what he asked fifteen; Fan me, ye winds, your
lady ship rallies me! should I part with it at such a price,
the weavers would rise upon the very Shop. Was you at
the Park last night, Madam ? Your ladyship shall abate me
sixpence. Have you read the <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi> to day ? &amp;c.</p>
   <p>'These fellows are positively the greatest fops in the
kingdom; they have their toilets and their fine night gowns;
their chocolate in the morning, and their green tea two hours
after; Turkey polts for their dinner; and their perfumes,
washes, and clean linen, equip them for the Parade.' </p>
   <p>We get a glimpse at the prices of silk dresses in the
following advertisement:  'The Silk Gowns formerly sold in
Exchange Alley, are removed to the sign of the Hood and
Scarf, directly over against Will's Coffee House in Cornhill,
where any Gentleman or Lady may be furnished with any




<pb n="178" id="p.178"/>

Size or Price, there being all Sorts of Silks, from rich
Brocades of 7 Guineas Price to Thread Sattin Gowns of
37s.,'  etc.</p>
   <p>Besides the stuffs described in the Female <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, there
were  'Silver Tishea, Pudsway Silks, Shaggs, Tabbeys,
Mowhairs, Grazets, Broches, Flowered Damasks, Flowered
Lustrings, ditto striped and plain, Sarsnets, Italian Mantuas,
Silk Plushes, Farendines, Shagreen, Poplins, Silk Crapes and
Durants' ; whilst among the woollen goods were  'Hair and
Woollen Camlets, Hair Plushes, Spanish and English druggets,
Serge Denims, Calamancoes, Russels, Serges, Shalloons,
Tammeys, Ratteens, and Salapeens.'  Ladies' black broadcloth cost
13s. 6d. per yard, fine scarlet 15s. 6d., and superfine do. 17s. 6d.</p>

   <p>Having a Queen upon the throne-one that kept her
Court, and dressed well-lace was naturally an article in
demand. The Queen was somewhat moderate at her
Coronation, for her point lace only came to &#x00A3;pound;pound;64 13s. 9d. It was
Flanders lace, and was allowed to be imported, provided it
was not made in  'the dominions of the French king.'  Mechlin
and Brussels lace first made their appearance in this reign,
and, in 171O, the Queen paid &#x00A3;pound;pound;151 for twenty-six yards of
fine edged Brussels lace. Indeed, Brussels lace was
somewhat dear:  'One Brussels Head is valued at &#x00A3;pound;pound;40; a grounded
Brussels head &#x00A3;pound;pound;30; one looped Brussels &#x00A3;pound;pound;30.'   'Lost
betwixt Hemming's Row and Owin Street near <placeName key="Leicester Fields">Leicester Fields</placeName>,
a Tin Box with Lace; whoever brings it to Mrs. Beck at the
Angel and Star in <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName> shall have &#x00A3;pound;pound;10 Reward and no
Questions ask'd.'   '9 pieces of fine Bone Lace belonging to
a Person of Quality'  were also lost, and &#x00A3;pound;pound;10 reward offered.
This lace does not always seem to have been made of thread,
for,  'Whereas two pieces of Silver Bone lace, was brought to
a shop in Winchester Street to be weighed, the Lace being
suppos'd to be stol'n, is stoped.'  Four pieces of <soCalled>' Macklin'</soCalled>
lace, lost, induced a reward of five guineas, and the finder
of three pieces of  'Brussels edging Lace'  is supposed to be
tempted by the offer of 10s. to bring them back.</p>
   <p>We have read in the robbery from Mr. Paggen's of a
number of garments with gold and silver lace, and with
silver  ' Orrices,'  and the use of bullion lace grew to such an
extent, that in <date value="1711">1711</date>, its entry was forbidden under pain of
forfeiture, and a fine of&#x00A3;100.</p>
   <p>The linen of this reign was finer, and better, than in those
preceding, and one linen draper of the time has handed his
name down to posterity, viz.  'Thomas Doyley at the Nun
in Henrietta Street, <placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName>.'  A list of the linens
then in vogue, is, as far as I can learn, as follows:  'White and
Brown Osnabrigs, Dowlas's, Kentings, Muslins, Bed ticks,
Garlets, Spotted Lawns, Sietias, Harford Blue, White Shorks,
Holland, Cambricks, Gentings, Callicoes, Damask, Diaper,
Huckabacks, Dimmities.' </p>
   <p>Of these  'fine double threaded Cottons for Sheetings'  was
12d. per yard and muslin 5s. 6d.</p>

<pb n="180" id="p.180"/>

   <p>The  'Tally Man'  was an institution in those days, and
was well known. His handbills remain, and there is a
singular unanimity among them; with one voice they make
Monday the day for purchases and payments. The reason
for this is obvious; at that early period of the week the
Saturday's earnings ought not to be spent. As a rule, the
terms were,  'Paying one shilling a Week for Thirty Shillings,
untill the Sum is paid for which they Contract.'  One
gentleman sticks up for his dignity, and begs you to  ' Note. That
these goods are not to be sold by a Tally man, but the
Money is to be taken by Weekly, or Monthly Payments,
according as it shall be agreed upon for the Ease of the
Customers.'  This system was as pernicious then as now,
only, as the law of arrest for debt was in full force, the
prisons held plenty of victims.</p>
   <p>It was not a particularly ostentatious age for jewellery,
and we can get a good idea of what was worn, by one or two
advertisements of lost property.  'Stolen the 11 th of this

   <p>There was lost a very interesting memorial ring, to which,
in those Jacobite days, no doubt a particular value was
attached.  'A Gold ring with 7 Diamonds in the form of a
Rose, which opens, and within the effigies of K. Charles I.
Enamelled, next the finger is C. R. with a Death's Head in
the middle.' </p>
   <p>Diamonds were much worn, and frequently lost. For the
following, a reward of 10 per cent. of their value was offered.
 'Lost &amp;c. 42 loose Diamonds, some of them large, belonging
to a Necklace, and two with holes made behind for Screws to
be put in, all strung on a white silk; and two Tags with 16
small Diamonds.'  For the next 100&#x00A3;. was offered, or
proportionate sums for portions.  ' Lost by a Person of Quality,

Brilliant Stone loose in a Collet. The middle stone in the
Cross weighs 10 grains, and the other 5 together 29 grains,
and the Diamond in the Collet 15 grains or there abouts.' </p>
   <p>The greatest loss of diamonds in this reign was the
following, for which a reward of 1,000 guineas, and the Queen's
pardon, was offered.  ' Whereas there were brought from India
in the Ship Albemarle (which was driven ashore at Pielpora
near Plimouth about the 9th of this instant December) Five
Bulses of Diamonds, which are pretending to be missing or
lost. . . . Amongst which said Diamonds was one very
uncommon, remarkable Diamond, viz. One cut Table Stone of

same time one large Rose Diamond set in Silver, and fastened

   <p>The Queen herself lost some diamonds on this memorable
occasion, but nothing of great value, as only ten guineas were
offered as a reward.  'Whereas there was Ten Small Diamonds
singly set in Silver, but made up together into a Sprig
fastened by a Wire, which were lost from her Majesty's Robes
in the Procession upon the Coronation Day,'  etc. This,
however, was not the only loss the Queen suffered during her reign,
some of her subjects conceiving a violent affection for her
plate-vide the following advertisements.  'Whereas several

   <p> The plate of this reign was heavy and cumbrous, and of
very little artistic merit. It was greatly in use, and was an
outward and visible sign of its owner's wealth. To such an
extent did its use obtain, that taverns were ordered not to
have silver tankards, the temptation to steal them being so
great.</p>
   <p> Ladies occasionally wore chatelaines in the street, and lost
them, whilst they seem only to have worn their watches for
the sake of losing their outer case, judging by the numbers
of advertisements. Being worn outside, there was nothing
easier to steal.  Not the whole watch; oh no! but gently to
press the spring, and the gold case was in the thief's
possession, with next door to no risk. They were absolutely asking




<pb n="184" id="p.184"/>

to be stolen. Even the little children must needs be decked
out with watches and chains.  ' Whereas a Gold Watch, with
a Gold Chain with 6 lockets, one of them with a Cypher
L. T. set with Pearl and Green Stones, was lost from a Childe
11 years old.'   'Stop't, a Child's Gold Chain suppos'd to be
stolen.'   'Cut off from a Child's neck yesterday, a Gold
Chain, four times about her Neck.'   'Taken from a Child,
a Gold Chain with this Motto, Memento Mori.'   ' Lost from a
Child's side a Silver Scissor Case, Open Work, with Scissors

<p>IN the matter of food, people were not gourmets as a rule.
The living was plentiful, but plain, and a dinner was never
more than two courses; as <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName> wrote,  'two plain dishes,
with two or three good natured, chearful, ingenious friends,
would make me more pleased and vain than all that pomp
and luxury can bestow;'  and this sentiment pervaded the
whole of society. Dinner is almost the only meal ever
mentioned, and one looks in vain for details of breakfast or supper.
They were taken, of course, but men, then, did not sufficiently
deify their stomachs, as to be always talking about them:
dinner was the meal of the day, and there is no doubt that
the most was made of that opportunity. <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName> says:  'The
English eat a great deal at dinner; they rest a while, and to it
again, till they have quite stuff'd their Paunch. Their Supper
is moderate: Gluttons at Noon, and abstinent at Night. I
always heard they were great Flesh eaters, and I found it
true. I have known several people in England that never
eat any Bread, and universally they eat very little: they
nibble a few crumbs, while they chew the Meat by whole
Mouthfuls. Generally speaking, the English Tables are not
delicately serv'd. There are some Noblemen that have both
French and English Cooks, and these eat much after the
French manner; but among the middling Sort of People they
have ten or twelve Sorts of common Meats, which infallibly

<pb n="186" id="p.186"/>

take their Turns at their Tables, and two Dishes are their
Dinners: a Pudding, for instance, and a Piece of Roast Beef;
another time they will have a piece of Boil'd Beef, and then
they salt it some Days before hand, and besiege it with five
or six Heaps of Cabbage, Carrots, Turnips, or some other
Herbs or Roots, well pepper'd and salted, and swimming in
putter: A Leg of roast or boil'd Mutton, dish'd up with the
same dainties, Fowls, Pigs, Ox Tripes, and Tongues, Rabbits,
Pidgeons, all well moistened with Butter, without larding:
Two of these Dishes, always serv'd up one after the other,
make the usual Dinner of a Substantial Gentleman, or wealthy
Citizen. When they have boil'd Meat, there is sometimes
one of the Company that will have the Broth; this is a kind
of Soup, with a little Oatmeal in it, and some Leaves of
Thyme or Sage, or other such small Herbs. They bring up
this in as many Porringers as there are People that desire
it; those that please, crumble a little Bread into it, and
this makes a kind of Potage.' </p>
   <p>Here, then, we have a very graphic, and evidently
unbiassed, account of the cuisine of this reign. Two o'clock
seems to have been the middle-class time of dining, but
people with any pretension to fashion dined later.  'Why,
does any Body Dine before Four a Clock in London ? For
my Part, I think it an ill bred Custom to make my Appetite
Pendulum to the Twelfth Hour. Besides, 'tis out of Fashion
to Dine by Day light.'  <note place="foot" n="1">The Basset Table. </note>
 And <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>, writing about <soCalled>'Rakes,'</soCalled>
says:  'All the noise towards six in the evening is caused by
his mimics and imitators;'  <note place="foot" n="2"><hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, No. 27.</note>
 thus leading to the inference that, dinner being at four, and wine being plentifully drunk
after it, they rose from table half drunk, and went noisily to
the coffee-houses.</p>
   <p>This, probably, was the case at such a place as Pontack's,
which held the first rank among the restaurants of the time.
It was situated in Abchurch Lane, and was said to have
derived its name from Pontack, a president of the Parliament
of Bordeaux, who gave his name to the best French clarets;
but this could hardly be the case, as all contemporary writers
call the proprietor Pontack. <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName> speaks in high terms of



<pb n="187" id="p.187"/>

the place. <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> writes to Stella:  'I was this day in the
City, and dined at Pontack's with Stratford, and two other
merchants. Pontack told us, although his wine was so good,
he sold it cheaper than others, he took but seven shillings a
flask;'  and again,  'I dined in the City at Pontack's with
Stratford; it Cost me Seven Shillings.'   ' Would you think
that little lap dog in Scarlet there, has Stomach enough to
digest a Guinea's worth of Entertainment at Pontack's every
Dinner Time ?'  <note place="foot" n="3"><hi rend="italics">Works of T. <persName key="Brown,Thomas">Brown</persName></hi>.</note>

<persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName> describes a tavern ordinary well; he is in his element;
but to give his description would take up too much room.
On entering the bar, the principal person visible was the
dame de comptoir,  ' all Ribbons, Lace and Feathers.'  Having
passed her, and taken a seat at the table, he had  'a Whet of
Old Hock'  to sharpen his appetite for dinner, which consisted
of two calves' heads, a couple of geese, and Cheshire cheese;
after which they all fell to a-drinking wine.</p>
   <p>There were cheaper places, or ordinaries, than these to
dine at.  'I went afterwards to Robin's, <note place="foot" n="8"> A Stock Jobbing Coffee House in Change Alley.</note>
 and saw People who
had dined with me at the Five penny Ordinary just before,
give Bills for the Value of large Estates;'  <note place="foot" n="9"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 454.
</note> and twopenny ordinaries are mentioned, but they must have been for the
very poor.</p>
   <p>In spite of what <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName> says, there was good cookery to
be got, only it hardly came into ordinary life; and there are




<pb n="188" id="p.188"/>

two cookery books<note place="foot" n="10"><hi rend="italics">England's Newest way in all Sorts of Cookery, etc., by Henry Howard, and
 'Royal Cookery, or the Complete Court Cook</hi>, by Patrick Lamb, Esq. Near 50
years Master Cook to their late Majesties King Charles 2. King James 2. King
William and Queen Mary, and to Her present Majesty Queen Anne.'
</note> which give most excellent receipts, and
show that there was plenty of variety, both in the material
and cooking of food; nay, even in the elegances of the
table, which were well cared for, as the following receipt of
Howard's shows:  ' How to dish up a Dish of Fruits with
preserved Flowers.-Take a large Dish, cover it with another
of the same bigness, and place the uppermost over with
Paste of Almonds, inlaid with red, white, blue, and green
Marmalade in the figure of Flowers and Banks; then take
the branches of candied Flowers, and fix them upright in
Order, and upon little Bushes erected, and covered with
Paste: Fix your preserved and Candied Cherries, Plumbs,
Pease, Apples, Goosberries, Currans, and the like, each in
their proper place; and for Leaves, you may use Coloured
Paste or Wax, Parchment, or Horn; and this, especially in
Winter, will be very proper.'  Some of the dishes he gives
are hardly in vogue now; as for instance:  ' Spinage Tarts.-
Take Marrow, Spinage, hard Eggs, of each a handful, Cloves,
Mace, Nutmeg, Limon-peel shred very fine; then put in as
many Currans as you think fit, with Raisins stoned, and
shred, candied, Orange and Citron peel; sweeten it to your
taste, make Puff Paste, and make them into little square
Pasties; bake or fry them.' </p>
   <p>Perhaps few people now would care to make Mr. Lamb's
 'Patty of Calves' Brains.-The Calves Brains being clean,
scald them, then blanch some Asparagus, and put it in a
Sauce pan, with a little Butter and Parsley; being Cold, put
the Brains in the Patty, with the Asparagus, five or six Yolks
of hard Eggs, and Forc'd Meat; season it with Pepper and
Salt. When it is bak'd, add the Juce of a Lemon, drawn
Butter and Gravy. So serve it.' </p>
    <p>Listen to <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName>'s ecstasies over our national dish-the
PUDDING.  'The Pudding is a Dish very difficult to be
describ'd, because of the several Sorts there are of it; Flower,
Milk, Eggs, Butter, Sugar, Suet, Marrow, Raisins, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
are the most common Ingredients of a Pudding. They bake


<pb n="189" id="p.189"/>

them in an Oven, they boil them with Meat, they make them
fifty several Ways: BLESSED BE HE THAT INVENTED PUDDING, for it is a Manna that hits the Palates of all Sorts of
People; a Manna better than that of the Wilderness, because
the People are never weary of it. Ah, what an excellent
Thing is an English Pudding ! To come in Pudding time, is
as much as to say, to come in the most lucky Moment in the
World.' <note place="foot" n="11">There was  'the Royal Peace Pudding, Tickets 1s. each, Made on
Thanksgiving Day, <date value="1713">1713</date>, 9 feet long, 20 and one half inches broad, and 6 inches deep,'  and there were
the famous 12d. Marrow puddings. Blood Puddings were also in vogue. See
<hi rend="italics">Trivia</hi> :-

    <p>Of fish he says:  'In Proportion Fish is dearer than any
other Belly-timber at London ;'  and as a matter of fact we
hear very little about it as an article
of food. The country, inland, was of<figure id="fig.36" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00036"><head>'FOUR FOR SIXPENCE, MACKERELL!'</head></figure>
course entirely dependent upon
freshwater fish, such as carp, jack, perch,
etc. The London market was at
Billingsgate (which kept up its
reputation for its peculiar vernacular), but
that was also waterman's stairs, and a
place of departure for boats; and here
was sold whatever fish was brought to
London. A little before every Lent
came vessels loaded with salt cod,
which were sold at 1s. 6d. to 2s. a
couple, and sometimes at 1d. per lb.
Mackerel, on account of its perishable
nature, was allowed to be sold on
Sunday, as <persName key="Gay,John">Gay</persName> notes,  'Ev'n
Sundays are prophan'd by Mackrell cries.' </p>
   <p>From Billingsgate the fish was distributed to the various
stalls throughout London:-

           <quote rend="blockquote">You'll see a draggled Damsel, here and there,
           From Billingsgate her fishy Traffick bear.</quote>



<pb n="190" id="p.190"/>

And these stalls are thus described:

         <quote rend="blockquote">When fishy Stalls with double Store are laid;
         The golden belly'd Carp, the broad-finn'd Maid,
         Red speckled Trouts, the Salmon's silver Soul,

         And luscious 'Scallops, to allure the Tastes

Care was taken for the preservation of salmon, as the
following notice shows:  ' Whereas by divers ancient statutes made
to prevent the Destruction of the Fry and Brood of Salmons,
it is ordained, That none shall be taken in any of the Rivers
or Waters, wherein Salmon is taken, between the 8th of
September and the 11th of November; and that none shall be
taken in the Waters in the County of Lancaster between the
29th of September and the 2d of February; and by a late
Statute, That no Salmons shall be taken in the County of
Southampton and the Southern Parts of Wiltshire between
the 30th of June and the 11th of November, nor be exposed
to Sale under the Penalties thereby provided: These are to
give Notice that all Salmons taken out of their Seasons, and
exposed to Sale in London, will be destroyed, as many lately
have been, by the Rt. Hon. the Lord Mayor of the said City,
as not fit to be sold for Victuals, being taken out of their
Seasons, contrary to the Statutes afore mentioned: And that
every Person bringing before the Lord Mayor such
unseasonable Salmons, shall have a Reward for the same, to be paid
by the Company of Fishmongers, London, as the Lord Mayor
for the time being shall think fit.' <note place="foot" n="12"><hi rend="italics">London Gazette</hi>, Oct. 31/Nov. 4, <date value="1706">1706</date>.</note>

   <p>Our River <placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName>, then, was really the habitat of good

   <p>It causes a sigh of regret to read of the great plenty, and
wonderful cheapness, of real native oysters. They were then,
as now, only considered fit to eat during the months with R





<pb n="191" id="p.191"/>

in them; and <persName key="Gay,John">Gay</persName>, speaking of autumn, says, as a sign of
its arrival,  'And Damsels first renew their Oyster Cries' ;
and in another part of  'Trivia'  he gives the following sound
advice:-
         <quote rend="blockquote">If where <placeName key="Fleet Ditch">Fleet Ditch</placeName> with muddy Current flows,
         You chance to roam; where Oyster Tubs in Rows

         The Damsel's Knife the gaping Shell commands,
         While the salt Liquor streams between her Hands.</quote> </p>

   <p>And they were wonderfully cheap, sold in the streets by
the wheelbarrow men at
 'Twelve Pence a Peck.' <figure id="fig.37" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00037"><head>'TWELVE PENCE A PECK, OYSTERS!'</head></figure>
There was keen
competition in them, and rival
fishmongers advertised
the superior excellence
of their oysters.  One
will serve as a sample
of the whole.  ' Thomas
West Fishmonger in
Honey Lane Market
near Blossom's Inn, gives
notice, That all Persons
who have occasion for
the Choicest of Oysters
called Colchester
Oysters, may be supplied for this Season with the largest pick't
Fat and Green for 3s. a Barrel; Those somewhat smaller

these Prizes I will sell the right Colchester Oysters, which,
without considering their goodness beyond other sorts, are
cheaper than the Town Wheel barrow Oysters: And that
all Persons in City or Country, that send for them, may no
ways be deceived of having the right sort, the prizes are all
branded on the side of the Cask. Note, they are all branded
at the Pits, where they are pickt, so that if there be any

Cheat, it must be by the Oyster Man, which hath been too
often practised to my Loss and their shameful Gain. My
Oysters Comes in on Monday's, Wednesdays, Thursdays and
Fridays by Water Carriage.  No Trader in the City or
Suburbs having them come in so often, by reason of which,
they will hold good the farthest Journey, to please the nicest
Eater. Those that are not bought at my own Shop, will, by
reason of the Extraordinary Charge be 2d. in a Barrel
advanc'd; and all that are desirous to have them from my
Shop, the same day that they come in of, they shall be

1d. And all other places proportionable, and when all is
said, I hope tryal will be your Satisfaction.' </p>
    <p>Pickled oysters were also imported from Jersey, and sold at
1s. 8d. per hundred. <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> writes Stella <note place="foot" n="14"><hi rend="italics">Journal</hi>, March 6, <date value="1712">1712</date>.</note>
 how  'Lord Masham
made me go home with him to night to eat boiled oysters.
Take Oysters, wash them clean, that is, wash their shells
clean; then put your oysters in an earthen pot, with their
hollow sides down, then put this pot covered, into a great
Kettle with water, and so let them boil. Your oysters are
boiled in their own liquor, and (do) not mix water.' </p>
   <p>Poultry, with the exception of game, was the same as
now; the only importation from foreign parts, seemingly,
being ortolans, which were brought over in September of
each year. The English ortolan, too, was keenly relished by
epicures.   ' You have a coarse stomach, and to such a one,
a Surloin of Beef were better than a dish of Wheat ears.'  <note place="foot" n="15"><hi rend="italics">The Virtuoso.</hi></note></p>
   <p>For relishes, there were anchovies 8d. per 1b., neats'
tongues and York hams 6d. per 1b.; but salt was somewhat
dear. The home manufacture did not supply the whole
demand, as now, and it was imported both from Portugal and
France.  Still, it was made at home.   'Whereas it hath
been reported, that there was not a sufficient quantity of Salt
made at Shirley wich, in the county of Stafford, to supply the
customers that came for it. This is to give notice, that with the
Additional Works, there is now twice the quantity made out
of the new Pit, much better and stronger than was formerly.'

<p>BEER always has been the alcoholic liquor most largely
consumed in England, and, among the poorer and lower
middle classes, it was so in Anne's reign; but it was looked
down upon, and despised, by the upper classes. It was of
different qualities, from the  'penny Nipperkin of Molassas
Ale'  <note place="foot" n="1"><hi rend="italics">London Spy</hi>.</note>
to  'a pint of Ale cost me fivepence.' <note place="foot" n="2"><hi rend="italics">Journal to Stella</hi>, Nov. 29, <date value="1710">1710</date>.</note>
  Not only were there the local brewers in London, but the excellence of
 ' right Darby'  and  'Sleeford or Lincolnshire'  ales was such
that these breweries were represented.  ' Right North Country
Pale Ale ready bottled at 4s. per dozen'  was also to be
had; and pale ale was exported.  'Any Merchant that has
occasion for Pale Ale and Stout, to send to the West Indies,
may at any time be supplied at the Fountain Brewhouse, by
the Hermitage, with Beer for Shipping at reasonable rates.'
Dantzic Spruce was also imported. Beer was taxed then, as
now, by the barrel.  'Yesterday the Commons, in a
Committee of Ways and Means, resolved, That an additional duty
of 3d. per barrel be laid upon all beer and ale above 6s. per
barrel; and under 6s., 1d.; vinegar 9d.; cyder per hogshead
5d.; strong waters mead and matheglin 1d. per gallon.' <note place="foot" n="3"><hi rend="italics"><persName key="Luttrell,Narcissus">Luttrell</persName>'s Diary</hi>, Jan. 24, <date value="1710">1710</date>.</note>

   <p>But, for well-to-do people, wine was the drink, and the
variety was nearly as great as in our time. It was a

must have been a not unusual salutation; but it was not

in the <hi rend="italics">Guardian</hi> (No. 58),  'who drink vast quantities of ale

<p>These evening potations rendered a morning's draught
generally necessary; but, after that, drinking was again
postponed till the day's work was over. The modern system
of  'nipping'  did obtain to a slight degree, but it was
reprehended.  'Whereas Mr. Bickerstaff, by a letter bearing date

  <p> The war with France made the French wines somewhat
scarcer than they would otherwise have been, and opened a
trade for wines from other countries; still the number of
prizes taken, laden with clarets, etc., and the efforts of
smugglers, kept the market pretty well supplied. The wines seem
to have been good, although the Spanish and Portuguese
wines were fortified with  ' Stum,'  a fact well known, especially


<pb n="199" id="p.199"/>

as to its effects:  'get drunk with Stum'd wine.' <note place="foot" n="7">Shadwell's <hi rend="italics">Epsom Wells</hi>.</note>
 The French
wines were very numerous-some even unknown to us by
their names-comprising Champagne, Burgundy, Frontiniac,
Muscat, Anjou, Bouvrie (? Vouvray), Bayonne, Obrian
(Hautbrion), Pontack, Claret, Bomas (? Pomard), High Priniac
(Preignac), La Fitt, Margouze (Margeaux), La Tour, Graves,
Cahorze, Blacart, Monson, Hermitage, Langoon, Bosmes
(? Beaumes), Macco (? Macon), Languedoc, and Cap Breton
clarets. Their prices were various: ordinary clarets from
the wood 4s. to 6s. per gallon; good bottled clarets from
3s. or 4s. to 10s. a bottle. Champagne came over in baskets
or hampers containing ten dozen to two hundred bottles per
basket, and was sold retail about 8s. a bottle. Good
Burgundy cost 7s. a bottle, but these prices varied, as they do
now, with the quality.</p>
   <p>French wines, however, were not universal favourites.  'A
Bottle or two of good solid Edifying Port, at honest George's,
made a Night chearful, and threw off Reserve. But this plaguy
French Claret will not only Cost us more Money, but do us less
Good,'  growls <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>.
<note place="foot" n="8"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 43.</note>
Being at war with France, it was considered patriotic not to drink French wine, and Port became
popular. Its introduction was owing to the treaty with
Portugal in <date value="1703">1703</date>, called the Methuen Treaty, from the name of
our minister at Lisbon. It is famed as being the shortest
treaty known, consisting of only two clauses, one that the
Portuguese should take British cloths, and the other that
Portuguese wines should be admitted here at one third less
duty than the French wines paid. Red Viana seems to have
been frequently substituted for port, and it was sold at about
5s. a gallon. Then there were White Viana, Lisbon, Passada,
Annadea, Bende Carlo (Beni Carlos), Barrabar, Carcavella,
and R<hi rend="italics">Ibid.</hi>via, whilst the Spanish wines were Sherry, Malaga,
Tent, Saragusa, Villa Nova, Barcelona, Alicant, Re Gallicia,
Sallo or Mattero, and White Muscadine. There were Florence
wines, which came over in rush-covered flasks with oil in the
neck of the flasks-Chiante, Multapulchana (? Montepulciano),
Madeira, Canary, Tockay from Hungary, and also (verily,
there is very little new under the sun) Carlowitz, from the


<pb n="200" id="p.200"/>

same country; there were wines from Neuchatel, and a wine
I cannot class, called Mount Allaguer. We hear very little
of Rhenish wines. In  'Tunbridge Walks'  an
uncomplimentary reference is made,  <foreign lang='DU'>'Dam rotgut Rhenish'</foreign> ; but fine old
hock was selling in I713 at 26s. a dozen, including bottles,
or new Rhenish might be had for 1s. 8d. a quart, or 6s. a
gallon. It is hardly worth going into the prices of these
miscellaneous wines. One advertisement will be sufficient.
 'Advertisement to Private Families of 33 Dozen Bottles
of excellent rich Palm Canary Wine, a Flower; also 45
Dozen of Curious Red Zant, a most noble and scarce Wine,
no Champaign or Burgundy drinks finer, and likewise 60
Dozen of Choice Florence Wine, true Flavour and Colour, all
perfect Neat, and as good as ever was tasted, reserv'd by a
Gentleman for his own drinking, but oblig'd to sell them:
The Palm Wine at 30s. a Dozen, the Zant and Florence
each 36s. Bottles and all (none less than 4 Bottles) which is
but at the rate of 2s. 3d. a Quart for the Palm Wine, and
2s. 9d. for the Zant and Florence, tho' would fetch more if
the Owner could Keep them, the like being scarcely to be
had in Town, at leastwise not under 3s. a Quart the first, and
3s. 6d. the last, if for that, and will be dearer.' </p>
   <p>Retailers had to take out a licence to sell wine; and of
course there were customs duties. <persName key="Luttrell,Narcissus">Luttrell</persName> says, Dec. 4, <date value="1703">1703</date>:
 ' Yesterday the Commons, in a Committee upon the Supply,
resolved, nemine contradicente, that 1s. per gallon be laid
upon all Wines over and above the present Customs, to be
paid by the retailer ;'  but, afterwards, he writes, Jan. 15, <date value="1704">1704</date>,
that the Commons rejected the bill for 1s. per gallon upon
wines.  On March 20, <date value="1706">1706</date>, the Queen gave her royal
assent to an Act  'for a further duty on low Wines' ; and, in
<date value="1713">1713</date>, French wines paid a duty of 4s. 6d. per gallon !</p>
   <p>The wine merchants of the time were an enterprising firm
named Brooke &amp; Hellier (mentioned in the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> more
than once), who had several branch establishments in various
parts of London, even brought wine by road from Bristol,
and one year paid as much as 25,000&amp;pound;. customs duties; but
they came to grief in <date value="1712">1712</date>, and dissolved partnership.
Brooke afterwards set up in business by himself.</p>



<pb n="201" id="p.201"/>

   <p>There was Batavian arrack for those that liked it,
usquebaugh (both green and golden), and brandy-especially
Nants brandy-beloved of the poor in penny drams. Not
but what there were other brandies-Gaudarella, Viana or Fial
(? Fayal), Strasburg, Spanish, and even our familiar old friend
British brandy.  The average retail price of  'right Nants'
seems to have been about 12s. per gallon, but Spanish could
be got 2s. 6d. per gallon cheaper. In <date value="1713">1713</date> the customs duty
on brandy was 6s. 8d. per gallon; freight and leakage came
to 2s. 6d.; so that it did not leave much profit after paying
for the brandy.</p>
  <p> There were liqueurs and cordials; and they must have
been very diversified, for the name of the  'Still room'  was
not then an empty sound; and scandal just whispered that
it was sometimes possible that the dear creatures tasted their
own manufactures. Are we to believe the following sketch ?
 'It would make a Man smile to behold her Figure in a front
Box, where her twinkling Eyes, by her Afternoon's Drams of
Ratifee and cold Tea, sparkle more than her Pendants...
Her Closet is always as well stor'd with Juleps, Restoratives,
and Strong Waters, as an Apothecary's Shop, or a Distiller's
Laboratory; and is herself so notable a Housewife in the
Art of preparing them that she has a larger Collection of
Chemical Receipts than a Dutch Mountebank . . . As soon
as she rises, she must have a Salutary Dram to keep her
Stomach from the Cholick; a Whet before she eats, to
procure Appetite; after eating, a plentiful Dose for
Concoction; and to be sure a Bottle of Brandy under her Bed
side for fear of fainting in the Night.' <note place="foot" n="9">
<hi rend="italics">Adam and Eve Stript of their Furbelows.</hi></note>
</p>
  <p> These cordials were not always palatable, if we can
believe <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName>'s description of <soCalled>'Widow Trueby's Water,'</soCalled>
which Sir Roger  'always drank before he went abroad.'
There were the  ' Ratafia of Apricocks,'  the  ' Fenouillette of
Rhe,'   'Millefleurs,'   'Orangiat,'   'Burgamot,'   'Pesicot,'  and
citron or cithern water, with many others. Elder and other
home-made wines were in use. Let us see how they were
appreciated.   'Her female Ancestors have always been
fam'd for good Housewifry, one of whom is made immortal,

<pb n="202" id="p.202"/>

by giving her Name to an Eye Water and two sorts of
Puddings.  I cannot undertake to recite all her Medicinal
Preparations; as Salves, Sere cloths, Powders, Confects,
Cordials, Ratifia, Persico, Orange Flower, and Cherry Brandy,
together with innumerable sorts of Simple Waters. But
there is nothing I lay so much to Heart, as that detestable
Catalogue of Counterfeit Wines, which derive their Names
from the Fruits, Herbs or trees of whose Juices they are
chiefly compounded: They are loathsome to the taste and
pernicious to the health; and as they seldom survive the Year,
and then are thrown away, under a false Pretence of Frugality,
I may affirm they stand me in more than if I entertain'd all
our Visiters with the best Burgundy and Champaign.' <note place="foot" n="10"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, 328.</note>
</p>
  <p> Punch had begun to make its appearance, but it was a
simple liquor to what afterwards became known by that
name. Here is a receipt given by a noted brandy merchant
of the time:  'Major Bird's Receipt to make Punch of his
Brandy. Take 1 Quart of his Brandy, and it will bear 2
Quarts and a Pint of Spring Water; if you drink it very
strong, then 2 Quarts of Water to a Quart of Brandy, with 6
or 8 Lisbon Lemmons, and half a Pound of fine Loaf Sugar:
Then you will find it to have a curious fine scent and flavour,
and Drink and Taste as clean as Burgundy Wine.' </p>
   <p>There was also an intoxicating liquor, still in limited use,
called  'Brunswick Mum,'  whose price was  '9s. the dozen
without doors, and 10s. within.'  The name of this compound
is supposed to be derived from its power of making men
speechlessly drunk.
         <quote rend="blockquote">The clamorous crowd is hush'd with mugs of mum,
         Till all, turn'd equal, send a general hum.</quote>
Bottled cyder, too, could be obtained at 6s. per dozen.</p>
   <p>The antidote to all these intoxicants was to be found
in  'The Essence of Prunes, Chymically prepar'd by a Son
of Monsieur Rochefort, a Sworn Chymist of France.  It
gives English Spirits the smell and taste of Nantz Brandy;
it prevents any Liquor from intoxicating the Brain.' </p>
<p>   We must not forget, however, that tea, coffee, and
chocolate were in much demand, and that both the coffee and


<pb n="203" id="p.203"/>

chocolate houses really supplied these beverages as their
staple article. Tea was more of a home drink, and was very
dear, reckoning the different values of money. Perhaps there
were greater fluctuations in its price than in any other article
of food. Black tea varied in <date value="1704">1704</date> from 12S. to 16s. per 1b.;
in <date value="1706">1706</date>, 14s. to 16s.; in <date value="1707">1707</date>, which seems to have been an
exceptionally dear year, 16s., 20s., 22s., 24s., 30s., and 32s.;
in <date value="1709">1709</date>, it was from  14s. to 28s.; and in <date value="1711">1711</date>, 12s. to 28s.
Green tea in <date value="1705">1705</date> was 13s. 6d. ; in <date value="1707">1707</date>, 20s., 22s., 26s.; in
<date value="1709">1709</date>, 10s. to 15s.; and in <date value="1710">1710</date>, 10s. to 16s. The difference
between old and new is given once.  The new tea is 14s.,
and the old 12s. and 10s.</p>
   <p>The margins in price are not only accounted for by the
difference in age, but it was well known that old leaves were
redried, and used in the cheaper sorts; indeed, there is a very
curious advertisement in the advertising portion of the <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>,
Aug. 26, <date value="1710">1710</date>:  'Bohea Tea, made of the same Materials that

only, at the Bell in Grace Church Street, Druggist. Note.

grey Colour. All other Bohea Tea, tho' there be White in it,

  <p> <persName key="Luttrell,Narcissus">Luttrell</persName> writes, Dec. 16, <date value="1704">1704</date>:  'The Commons in a
Committee of wayes and means, resolved to double the duties on
Coffee, Tea, and Chocolate.' </p>
  <p> The first noteworthy incident in the price of coffee in this
reign is an advertisement. <note place="foot" n="11"><hi rend="italics">Postman</hi>, April 27/30, <date value="1706">1706</date>.</note>
  'Whereas Coffee was formerly
sold at 2s. 6d. per pound, and is now already amounted to
betwixt 6s. and 7s. per pound, the Majority of the Retailers
have thought it reasonable to request their Customers to pay
3 half pence per Dish, and do assure that no person that
sells Coffee for 1d. a Dish can make good Coffee.'  It is rather
interesting to watch the fluctuations in price. In <date value="1706">1706</date>, from
6s. to 6s. 8d. per 1b.; in <date value="1707">1707</date>, from 7s. it fell to 5s. 10d. and
5s. 4d.; in <date value="1708">1708</date> it rose, either owing to speculation, or a
failure in the crop, to 8s. 4d., 10s., and 11s. 6d., which was the
highest price, when it fell to 9s. 10d. and 9s. In <date value="1709">1709</date> it still
further fell-7s. 4d. and 6s. 8d.; and in <date value="1710">1710</date> it was 5s. 8d.</p>

<pb n="204" id="p.204"/>

   <p>Attention was paid to its manufacture, for we find that
 'Thomas Burges, Druggist, removed from Snow hill to the
Blew Anchor in <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, near Serjeants Inn, sells the
best of Coffee roasted after a new way, having a better
flavour, and is a much sweeter way than the common method
of roasting Coffee.' </p>
   <p>As tea came into favour, chocolate-drinking fell into
disuse, although it was generally taken as a drink the first thing
in the morning, before taking tea and toast. It was of two
kinds, Caracas or Caraco, and Martineco; and the former was
the most esteemed. It was roasted and ground, and either
sold plain or mixed with sugar. Its usual price was 3s. per lb.
for the one, and 2s. 6d. for the other. Early in <date value="1703">1703</date>, a man
advertised a machine of his invention, for making chocolate
of a far superior quality, at least 1s. per 1b. under the then
prices; and, as his advertisements are somewhat curious,
an example is given:  'To the Nobility and Gentry. Whereas
the Author of the new Invention for making Chocolate, hath
given a general Satisfaction both for its fineness, goodness
and Cheapness, to all those that ever yet drank of the same,
besides the Satisfaction all persons have of its being cleanly
made, upon sight of the Invention, which some Malicious
persons, the better to impose upon the World to vend their
foul broken Nuts does imitate; but for the working part
are as Ignorant as a Natural Bull. But the Author of this
Invention thinks himself oblig'd to declare to the World, after
10 Years improving the same with great charge and labour,
as many honourable persons in London can testifie; and if
any person can make it appear, that they were the first
Inventers of this so great a conveniency, as does no ways
exceed 12 Inches, before himself, the Author will lay it by,
and Act no more, notwithstanding he is now actually
petitioning Her Majesty for a Patten, and, till such time as he
shall obtain the same, will continue to make and sell his
Chocolate at these Rates following, viz. All Spanish Nut
with Vanello at 4s. 8d. a pound, plain 4s. 2d. all Marteneco
Nut with Vanello 3s. 8d.-plain 3s. 2d.-both sorts made up
with Sugar answerable. If any Chocolate maker, or others,
can make it appear he reserves above 8d. in selling a pound

  <pb id="p.205" n="205"/>

for labour and charges in making, a farther remittance shall
be made in the price.'  This gentleman subsequently
advertised that he sold it at  '2d. per Dish liquid-14d. a Quart
without doors. Sundays excepted.' </p>
   <p>The duty on the nuts was sufficiently high to induce
smuggling.  'Last Week 6 Sacks of Cocoa Nuts were seiz'd

so many sacks of Beans.'  <note place="foot" n="12"><hi rend="italics">London Post</hi>, April 14/17, <date value="1704">1704</date>.</note>

the practice of smoking among the men. <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName>, who disliked
smoking, gives the following account of a famous tobacco
shop in <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>. Speaking of the company assembled,
he says:  'There was no Talking amongst 'em, but Puff was
the Period of every Sentence; and what they said was as
short as possible, for fear of losing the Pleasure of a Whiff,
as How d'ye do?   Puff.  Thank ye.  Puff. Is the Weed
good?   Puff. Excellent.  Puff.  It's fine Weather.  Puff.
G-d be thanked. Puff. What's a clock. Puff, &amp;c. Behind
the Counter stood a Complaisant Spark who I observ'd
show'd as much Breeding in the Sale of a Pennyworth of
Tobacco, and the Change of a Shilling, as a Courteous
Footman when he meets his Brother Skip in the Middle of Covent
Garden; and is so very Dexterous in Discharge of his
Occupation, that he guesses from a Pound of Tobacco to an Ounce,
to the certainty of one single Corn. And will serve more
Pennyworths of Tobacco in half an Hour, than some
Clouterly Mundungus Sellers shall be able to do in half Four
and Twenty. He never makes a Man wait the Tenth part
of a Minute for his Change, but will so readily fling you down
all Sums, without Counting, from a Guinea to three
Pennyworth of Farthings, that you would think he had it ready


<pb n="207" id="p.207"/>

in his Hand for you before you ask'd him for it. He was
very generous of his Small beer to a good Customer; and
I am bound to say thus much in his behalf, That he will
show a Man more Civility for the taking of a Penny than
many Mechanicks will do for the taking a Pound.' </p>
   <p> 'Tobacco is very much used in England.  The very
Women take it in Abundance, particular'y in the Western
Counties,'  writes <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName>, and <persName key="Brown,Thomas">Brown</persName> also mentions the
practice; but, although Jorevin reports that in Charles the Second's
time, in Worcestershire, it was not only usual for the women
to join the men in smoking, but that the children were sent
to school with pipes in their satchels, and the schoolmaster
called a halt in their studies whilst they all smoked-he
teaching the neophytes-yet <persName key="Thoresby,Ralph">Thoresby</persName> runs him very hard.
 '20 Jan. <date value="1702">1702</date>. Evening with brother &amp;c. at Garraway's<note place="foot" n="1">At Leeds.</note>
Coffee House; was surprised to see his sickly child of
three years old fill its pipe of Tobacco and smoke it as
audfarandly as a man of three score; after that, a second
and a third pipe without the least concern, as it is said to
have done above a year ago.' </p>
   <p>The tobacco was twisted into rope and made up in rolls,
more after the fashion of Varinas Knaster than of our other
twisted tobaccos, and it generally had to be cut up before
using. Its price may be learned from the following
advertisements.  'Whereas there has been several Persons who
have pretended to sell the true Spanish roll'd Tobacco;
These are therefore to inform the World, that Jeremiah
Stoaks at Garraway's Coffee House in Exchange Ally,
bought the whole Parcel that was brought into England,
as by Prize taken by Her Majesty's Fleet at Vigo, and
that there is not a Nett Portacco in England but what he
has in his Hands; These are therefore to advise all
Gentlemen, that they may be furnish'd with the same tobacco at
8s. per Pound, at the above mentioned Place, and no where
else.'   This class of tobacco was evidently exceedingly
choice, comparing it with the ordinary price.  'Benjamin
Howes, Tobacconist, at the Corner of Shoe Lane in <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>,
London, who hath lived there 30 years and upwards;

<pb n="208" id="p.208"/>

he was Partner with Mr. Montague, did sell his best
old, mild, sweet-scented Virginia Tobacco for 2s. per Pound,
does now, and will continue to sell the same for 20d., either
Large Cut, Small or Long Cut, and Penny Papers for
Taverns or Publick Houses, full half Ounces for 20d. a
Pound (for present Money). He sells right Spanish in the
Roll for 8s. a Pound, and Spanish and Virginia mixt for
3s. a pound, and Encouragement to Country Chapmen.' </p>
   <p>There was a Customs duty on tobacco, of course; and
we find, in <date value="1707">1707</date>, the Irish Parliament increasing this tax,
among many others, in order to vote a supply of 135,000&amp;pound;.
to Her Majesty.  'Dublin, 5 Aug. Resolved, That it is the
Opinion of this Committee that the said Additional Duty
be three pence halfpenny per Pound weight on all Tobacco
which shall be so Imported into this Kingdom, from and after
the said 29th day of September <date value="1707">1707</date> over and above the
Hereditary Duty of two pence halfpenny per Pound,
payable for the same.' </p>
   <p>But it was the singular growth of the practice of taking
snuff that specially marks the reign of Anne, before which
time it was comparatively unknown. <persName key="Lillie,Charles">Lillie</persName>, the perfumer,
previously mentioned, sold snuff, as all his craft did: and
from him we get a very interesting account of its rise. He
says:  'Before the year <date value="1702">1702</date>, when we sent out a fleet of
ships under the command of Sir George Rooke, with land
forces commanded by the Duke of Ormond, in order to
make a descent on Cadiz, snuff taking was very rare, and,
indeed, little known in England; it being chiefly a luxurious
habit among foreigners residing here, and a few of the
English gentry who had travelled abroad. Among these,
the mode of taking the snuff was with pipes of the size of
quills, out of small spring boxes.  These pipes let out a
very small quantity of snuff, upon the back of the hand, and
this was snuffed up the nostrils with the intention of
producing the sensation of sneezing, which, I need not say,
forms now no part of the design, or rather fashion of snuff
taking.</p>
   <p>'But to return to our expedition by sea. When the fleet
arrived near Cadiz, our land forces were disembarked at a



<pb n="209" id="p.209"/>

place called Port St. Mary, where, after some fruitless attempts,
it was resolved to re-embark the troops, and set sail for
England. But previous to this, Port St. Mary, and some
adjacent places were plundered. Here, besides some very
rich merchandize, plate, jewels, pictures, and a great quantity
of cochineal, several thousand barrels and casks of fine snuffs
were taken, which had been manufactured in different parts
of Spain. Each of these contained four tin canisters of
snuff of the best growth, and of the finest Spanish
manufacture.</p>
   <p>'With this plunder on board (which fell chiefly to the
share of the land officers) the fleet was returning to
England; but, on the way, it was resolved to pay a visit to
Vigo, a considerable port in Spain, where the Admiral had
advice that a number of galleons from the Havannah, richly
laden, had put in. Here our fleet got in and destroyed
most, or all of the Spanish shipping, and the plunder was
exceedingly rich and valuable.</p>
   <p>'It now came to the turn of the sea officers and sailors
to be snuff proprietors and merchants; for, at Vigo, they
became possessed of prodigious quantities of gross snuff,
from the Havannah, in bales, bags, and scrows, <note place="foot" n="2">Raw hide packages.</note>
 which were
designed for manufacture in different parts of Spain. Thus,
though snuff taking was very little known or practised in
England, at that period, the quantities taken in this
expedition, (which was estimated at fifty tons weight,) plainly
shew that in the other countries of Europe, snuff was held
in great estimation, and that the taking of it was considered
not at all unfashionable.</p>
   <p>'The fleet having returned to England, and the ships
being ordered to be laid in their several ports, the sea
officers and sailors brought their snuff (which was called,
by way of victorious distinction, Vigo Snuff,) to a very
quick and cheap market; waggon-loads of it being sold at
Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Chatham, for not more than
three or four pence per pound.</p>
   <p>'This sort of bale snuff had never been seen or known in
England before, except through some Spanish Jews, who,


<pb n="210" id="p.210"/>

in the present case, bought up almost the whole quantity at a
considerable advantage.</p>
    <p>'The land officers, who were possessed of the fine snuffs
taken at Port St. Mary, sold some of them in the several
ports at which they landed.  Others of them, however,
understood better the nature of the commodity which had
fallen to their share, and kept it for several years, selling it
off by degrees, for very high prices.</p>
    <p>'From the above mentioned quantity of different snuffs,
thus distributed throughout the kingdom, novelty being
quickly embraced by us in England, arose the custom and
fashion of snuff taking; and, growing upon the whole nation,
by degrees, it is now almost as universal here, as in any other
part of Europe.' </p>
    <p>But snuff was not always sold ready made: people made
their own, out of roll tobacco-by means of rasps, which
were generally carried in the pocket. Specimens of these
rasps may be seen at the <placeName key="South Kensington Museum">South Kensington Museum</placeName>,
but, unless they are in some loan collection, they are very
poor examples. In private collections, and especially on
the Continent, are some of them, being exquisite specimens
of ivory carving.  'Then there's the Miscellany, an apron
for Stella, a pound of chocolate, without sugar, for Stella, a
fine snuff rasp of ivory, given me by Mrs. St. John for
Dingley, and a large roll of tobacco, which she must hide,
or cut shorter out of modesty, and four pair of spectacles for
the Lord knows who.'  <note place="foot" n="3"><hi rend="italics">
Journal to Stella</hi>, Nov. 3, <date value="1711">1711</date>.</note></p>

   <p>Here we see how customary it was for ladies to take
snuff in <date value="1711">1711</date>, although <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName> seems to be shocked at it, as
quite a new fashion in <date value="1712">1712</date>. Vide his letter in <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>
(344):  ' I have writ to you three or four times to desire
you would take notice of an impertinent Custom the Women,
the fine Women, have lately fallen into, of taking Snuff.
This silly Trick is attended with such a Coquet Air in
some Ladies, and such a sedate Masculine one in others, that
I can not tell which to most complain of; but they are to
me equally disagreeable. Mrs. Saunter is so impatient of
being without it, that she takes it as often as she does Salt


<pb n="211" id="p.211"/>

  at meals; and as she affects a wonderful Ease and
Negligence in all her manners, an upper Lip mixed with Snuff
  and the Sauce is what is presented to the Observation of all
  who have the honour to eat with her. The pretty Creature
  her Niece does all she can to be as disagreeable as her Aunt;
  and, if she is not so offensive to the Eye, she is quite as much
  to the Ear, and makes up all she wants in a confident Air,
  by a nauseous Rattle of the Nose, when the Snuff is
delivered, and the Fingers make the Stops and Closes on the
  Nostrils. . . . But Flavilla is so far taken with her
Behaviour in this kind, that she pulls out her Box (which is
  indeed full of good Brazile) in the middle of the Sermon ;<note place="foot" n="4">See also <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, 140.</note>
  and to shew she has the Audacity of a well bred Woman,
  she offers it to the Men, as well as to the Women who sit
  near her .... On Sunday was sennight, when they came
  about for the Offering, she gave her Charity with a very good
  Air, but at the same Time asked the Church warden if he
  would take a Pinch.' </p>
    <p>But, if the ladies took snuff, how much more did the men ?
 who were especially addicted to  'the humour of taking
 SNUFF, and looking dirty about the mouth by way of
ornament.'  They took snuff  'with a very Jantee Air,'  <note place="foot" n="5">
<persName key="Centlivre,Susannah">Centlivre</persName>'s<hi rend="italics"> The Wonder, a Woman A Keeps a Secret</hi>, ed. <date value="1714">1714</date>.</note>
 as is well exemplified by <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>'s humorous puff in <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> (138): ' The
 Exercise of the Snuff Box, according to the most
fashionable Airs and Motions, in opposition to the Exercise of the

 Buildings in <placeName key="the Strand">the Strand</placeName>, and Attendance given for the

 Snuff to a Stranger, a Friend, or a Mistress, according to the
 Degrees of Familiarity or Distance; with an Explanation of
 the Careless, the Scornful, the Politick, and the Surly Pinch,
and the Gestures proper to each of them.' </p>
    <p>Snuff was not always taken with the finger and thumb,




<pb n="212" id="p.212"/>

but a spoon was used-as it is now, in some parts of
Scotland, Lapland, Sweden, Norway, and China. In the
prologue of a play called  '<placeName key="Hampstead Heath">Hampstead Heath</placeName>,'  published in I706,
this habit is mentioned.

   <p>A more exhaustive list could have been made, but enough
is given to show the difference in price of the various sorts.
These were more than have just been given, and included
Oronoko, Barcelona, Portugal, Tonkar, Orangerie, Port St.
Mary's, Alicant, Rancia, and Cabinet Havannah.</p>
   <p>And there were snuffs which hardly came under the
category of harmless sternutatories: as,  'The true Imperial

for all Humours in the Eyes and Dimness of sight, and

   <p>Snuff played its part in helping to pay for the long war

  '9 Feb. <date value="1710">1710</date>. Yesterday the House of

<p>THE coffee-house was not a new institution in Anne's reign,
but then it reached the zenith of its popularity. It was
the centre of news, the lounge of the idler, the rendezvous
for appointments, the mart for business men. Men might
have their letters left there, as did <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName>;
<note place="foot" n="1"><hi rend="italics">Journal to Stella</hi>, letter 14.</note>

next Irish Post, except he sees M. D.'s little handwriting in
the glass frame at the bar of <placeName key="St. James's Coffee House">St. James's Coffee House</placeName>, where
Presto would never go but for that purpose.'  They were alike
the haunt of the wit and the man of fashion-a neutral
meeting-ground for all men, although they naturally assorted
themselves, like to like, by degrees. There
           <quote rend="blockquote">The gentle Beau too, Joyns in wise Debate,
           Adjusts his Cravat, and Reforms the State</quote> <note place="foot" n="3">The Tripe Club.</note>


-and he might even rub shoulders with a highwayman, as
Farquhar suggests, when he makes Aimwell say to Gibbet,<note place="foot" n="4">The Beaux' Stratagem, act iii. sc. 2.</note>
who is a highwayman,  'Pray Sir, ha'nt I seen your face at
Will's Coffee House?'  and he replies,  'Yes Sir, and at
White's too.'  But the excellent rules in force, and the good
common sense of the frequenters, prevented any ill effects


<pb n="215" id="p.215"/>

from this admixture of classes. All were equal, and took
the first seat which came to hand. If a man swore, he was
<figure id="fig.38" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00038"><head>A COFFEE HOUSE.</head></figure>
fined 1s., and if he began a quarrel he was fined 'dishes'
round.  Discussion on religion was prohibited, no card-playing

<pb n="216" id="p.216"/>

or dicing allowed, and no wager might be made
exceeding 5s. These were the simple rules generally used,
and, if they were only complied with, all must have felt the
benefit of such a mild despotism.</p>
   <p>Wood mentions that the first coffee-house was at Oxford,
and was kept, in <date value="1650">1650</date>, by Jacobs, a Jew. The first in
London, seems to have been kept by a foreigner named Rosa
Pasquee, in <date value="1652">1652</date>, in St. Michael's Alley, Cornhill, whilst
Hatton says <note place="foot" n="5"><hi rend="italics">New View of London,</hi> <date value="1708">1708</date>.</note>:  'I find it Recorded that one James Farr,
a Barber, who kept the Coffee House which now is the
Rainbow, by the <placeName key="Inner Temple Gate">Inner Temple Gate</placeName>, (one of the first in
England) was in the year <date value="1657">1657</date> presented by the Inquest of
St. Dunstans in the W. for Making and Selling a sort of
Liquor, called Coffee, as a great Nusance and Prejudice of
the neighbourhood, &amp;c. And who would then have thought
London would ever have had near 3,000 such Nusances, and
that Coffee should have been (as now) so much Drank by the
best of Quality and Physicians.'  Of these  'near 3,000'  I
have, in my searches through the newspapers, etc., of the
period, found the names of over 500, which, to preserve them
again from  falling into oblivion, are to be found in the
Appendix to this book.</p>
   <p>These coffee-houses sold alcoholic liquors as well as
coffee; a fact which is somewhat whimsically illustrated
in the following extract from  a letter of Bishop Trelawney
to Bishop Sprat, July 20, <date value="1702">1702</date> or 3. <note place="foot" n="6"><hi rend="italics">Atterbury's Correspondence</hi>, ed. <date value="1784">1784</date>, vol. iii. p. 87.</note>
  'I had a particular
obligation to Burnett, and will publicly thank him in print

whereas the Major General,<note place="foot" n="7">His brother. Bishop Trelawney was also a baronet; and he had an

he always said it was the baronet, not the bishop, that swore. The inconvenience

that, if the baronet was damned for swearing, what would become of the bishop ?</note>
 Captain Culleford, a very honest
Clergyman, and the people of the Inn (which was a coffee

   <p><persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName>, speaking of coffee-houses, says:  'These Houses,
which are very numerous in London, are extreamly
convenient. You have all Manner of News there: You have a
good Fire, which you may sit by as long as you please; You
have a Dish of Coffee, you meet your Friends for the
Transaction of Business, and all for a Penny, if you don't Care to
spend more.'  Yes, that was all-anybody, decently dressed,
might have all this accommodation for One Penny.  'Laying
down my Penny upon the Bar,'  writes <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName>, <note place="foot" n="8"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 31.</note> and  'so

that the habitue's spent no more; and <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>, in the first
number of the <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, speaking of the expenses attending
the production of the paper, says:  'I once more desire my
readers to consider, that as I cannot keep an ingenious man
to go daily to Will's under two pence each day, merely for
his charges; to White's under sixpence; nor to the Grecian,
without allowing him some plain Spanish (snuff) to be as
able as others at the learned table,'  etc.</p>
   <p>A man with leisure got rid of some hours daily at the
coffee house, or houses, and such a one would spend from
1O A.M. till noon, and again, after his two-o'clock dinner,
would be there from 4 to 6, when he would leave for the
theatre, or his turn in the park.</p>
   <p>The illustration gives us an excellent idea of the interior
of a coffee-house, and its domestic economy--the dame de
comptoir, the roaring fire with its perpetual supply of hot
water, and its coffee and tea pots set close by, so as to be
kept warm, and the very plain tables and stools, show the
accommodation that was required, and accepted, by the very
plain-living people of that day.</p>

At the Bar the good Man always places a Charming Phillis

<pb n="219" id="p.219"/>

Morning, know that my friend Beaver the Haberdasher has
a Levy of more undissembled Friends and Admirers, than
most of the Courtiers or Generals of Great Britain. Every
Man about him has, perhaps, a News Paper in his Hand;
but none can pretend to guess what Step will be taken in
any one Court of Europe, till Mr. Beaver has thrown down
his Pipe, and declares what Measures the Allies must enter
into upon this new Posture of Affairs. Our Coffee House is
near one of the Inns of Court, and Beaver has the Audience
and Admiration of his Neighbours from Six 'till within
a Quarter of Eight, at which time he is interrupted by the
Students of the House; some of whom are ready dress'd for
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, at Eight in a Morning, with Faces as busie as
if they were retained in every Cause there; and others come
in their Night Gowns to saunter away their Time, as if they
never designed to go thither. I do not know that I meet
in any of my Walks, Objects which move both my Spleen
and laughter so effectually, as these young Fellows at the
Grecian, Squire's, Searle's, and all other Coffee Houses
adjacent to the Law, who rise early for no other purpose but
to publish their Laziness. One would think these young
Virtuosos take a gay Cap and Slippers, with a Scarf and
Party Coloured Gown, to be Ensigns of Dignity, for the
vain things approach each other with an Air, which shews
they regard one another for their Vestments. . . . When the
Day grows too busie for these Gentlemen to enjoy any longer
the Pleasures of their Deshabille with any manner of
Confidence, they give place to Men who have Business or Good
Sense in their Faces, and come to the Coffee house, either to
transact Affairs or enjoy Conversation.' </p>
   <p>News was, of course, one of the prime objects of these
gatherings.  'I love News extreamly, I have read Three
News Letters to day. I go from Coffee House to Coffee
House all day on Purpose,'  <note place="foot" n="12"><hi rend="italics">The Scowrers</hi>.</note>
 was literally true of some men.
Not that their little newspapers gave them much-but of
them hereafter. Yet there was a chance of hearing some
news before it got into the papers; and the quidnuncs would
go to the Windsor, where was to be had  ' also the Translation

<pb n="220" id="p.220"/>

of the Harlem Courant, soon after the Post is come,'
or to Grigsby's, where  'all Foreign News is taken in, and
Translated into English immediately after the arrival of any
Mail,'  or to Elford's, where  'is to be seen and read Gratis,
the Journal of the famous Voyage of the Duke and Dutchess
Privateer of Bristol, that took the rich Aquiapulca Ship
containing many remarkable Transactions. Also an Account of
a Man living alone 4 Years and 4 Months in the Island of
John Fernando, which they brought with them.'  This was,
of course, Alexander Selkirk, who was brought off the
island on February 12, <date value="1709">1709</date>; and this log, or the
coffeehouse gossip anent it, probably furnished the inspiration for
 'Robinson Crusoe,'  which <persName key="Defoe,Daniel">Defoe</persName> published in <date value="1772">1772</date>.</p>
   <p>We have seen how the coffee-house keepers tried to
advance their beverages from 1d. to 1 and a half d. because of the rise
in coffee; but the effort was spasmodic, and did not last.
They had a far better cry in <date value="1712">1712</date>, as we find in the <hi rend="italics">Daily
Courant</hi> of August 8 in that year.  'These are to give
Notice, That the Coffee Men by reason of the present Taxes
on Coffee, Tea, Paper, Candles, and Stamps on all Newspapers,
find themselves under a necessity of advancing some of their
Liquors to the prices following; viz, Coffee 2d. per dish:
Green Tea 3 halfpence; and all Drams 2d. per Dram: to
commence from this day.'  Let us hope when they got this
huge advance they made their tea stronger, and did not give
their customers  'that pall'd Stuff too often found in mean
Coffee Houses.'  <note place="foot" n="13">Motteux, in the Preface to his
<hi rend="italics">Poem in Praise of Tea</hi>.</note></p>
   <p>No doubt, from the familiar abbreviations, such as Tom's,
Ned's, Will's, John's, etc., some of the coffee-houses were
kept by waiters who had saved a little money-such an one
as  ' Tom the Tyrant; who, as first Minister of the Coffee
House, takes the Government upon him between the Hours
of Eleven and Twelve at night, and gives his Orders in the
most Arbitrary manner to the Servants below him as to the

   <p>The chocolate-houses seem to have been a specialty, and
they were few in number. In the commencement of the
reign, in <date value="1702">1702</date>, chocolate was sold at 12d. the quart, 2d. the
dish. I can only find the names of five chocolate-houses
(describing themselves as such), and but two of them are of
any note, White's and the Cocoa Tree. White's was started
in <date value="1698">1698</date>, and was, in Queen Anne's reign, situated five doors
from the bottom of the west side of <placeName key="St. James's Street">St. James's Street</placeName>,
ascending from <placeName key="St. James's Palace">St. James's Palace</placeName>. It had a small garden
attached to it. This house was burnt down in <date value="1723">1723</date>, the
King and Prince of Wales looking on. Hogarth has
immortalised this event in Plate 6 of the  'Rake's Progress.'
It was to all intents and purposes a gambling house. When
White died is not known, but Mrs. White had it in March
<date value="1712">1712</date>. Afterwards it passed into the hands of Arthur, who
had it when it was burnt down; and he removed next door
to the <placeName key="St. James's Coffee House">St. James's Coffee House</placeName>. It soon ceased to be a
chocolate house, and became a club.   In <date value="1755">1755</date> it was
removed to No. 38, on the opposite or east side of St.
James's Street. White's Club is supposed to be political;
but, apart from its members being Conservative, it takes
no leading part, contenting itself with being extremely
aristocratic.</p>
   <p>The Cocoa Tree Chocolate House stood at the end of
Pall Mall, on the site of what now is 87 <placeName key="St. James's Street">St. James's Street</placeName>.
It was a Tory house; indeed, <persName key="Defoe,Daniel">Defoe</persName> says,  'A Whig will no
more go to the Cocoa Tree or Ozinda's, than a Tory will be
seen at the Coffee house of <placeName key="St. James's">St. James's</placeName>.'  The Cocoa Tree
Club is now held at 64 <placeName key="St. James's Street">St. James's Street</placeName>.</p>
   <p>As the coffee-houses occupied so prominent a part in
the social economy of the time, a very brief notice of
some of the best known will be of interest. Anderton's is
still in <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, beloved of Freemasons and literary
men. Batson's, in Cornhill, was a famous meeting-place for
physicians. The Bay Tree still stands in St. Swithin's Lane.
Button's, which was opposite Tom's, in Russell Street, Covent
Garden, was a great resort of <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName>'s; and here
contributions to the <hi rend="italics">Guardian</hi> could be received. The lion's head
which served as a letter-box has been immortalised in that

<pb n="222" id="p.222"/>

paper. It was in imitation of the famous lion at Venice.
The original is still in existence, but is not always accessible
to the curious. It was removed from Button's when that
coffee-house was taken down, and took refuge in the
Shakespeare's Head Tavern, <placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName>. For a time it was
placed in the Bedford Coffee House, and was used as a letter
<figure id="fig.39" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00039"><head>THE LION AT BUTTON'S.</head></figure>
box for contributions to The Inspector. It returned to the
Shakespeare's Head in <date value="1769">1769</date>, and remained there till <date value="1804">1804</date>.
It was then bought by Charles Richardson, the proprietor
of Richardson's Hotel, and at his death it came into the
possession of his son, who sold it to the Duke of Bedford,
and it is now preserved in Woburn Abbey.</p>



<pb n="223" id="p.223"/>

     <p>Child's was in <placeName key="St. Paul's">St. Paul's</placeName> Churchyard, and was famous
  for its learned frequenters. It was not far from the College
  of Physicians, which was then in Warwick Lane, so doctors
  came there, and, chief among them, Dr. Mead. Sir Hans
  Sloane and other members of the Royal Society dropped in,
  and the house was a noted resort of clergymen-so much so,
  that it is mentioned as such in the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> (No. 609):
   'For that a young Divine, after his first Degree in the
  University, usually comes hither only to shew himself, and on
  that Occasion is apt to think he is but half equipp'd with a
  Gown and Cassock for his publick Appearance, if he hath
  not the additional Ornament of a Scarf of the first
Magnitude to entitle him to the appellation of Doctor from his
  Landlady, and the Boy at Child's.' </p>
     <p>The Camisards was in <persName key="St. Martin's Lane">St. Martin's Lane</persName>, and took its
  name from the Camisars, who were French religious fanatics,
  who, being persecuted in their own country, came over here
  in <date value="1707">1707</date>. They claimed the gifts of prophecy, and of working
  miracles. The sect soon died out. Dick's, in <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>,
  still stands, and was so called from its first proprietor,
  Richard Turner, in <date value="1680">1680</date>.</p>
     <p>Garraway's is famous, and derived its name from its
 original proprietor, Thomas Garway, a tobacconist and
coffeeman, who had it in the middle of the 17th century. He is
 said to have been the first to retail tea. It was always a
 mercantile resort, and here were sold wines, etc., by auction.
 The Grecian, in Devereux Court, Temple, was chiefly visited
 by learned men; it was from this place that <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>, in his
 scheme of the <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, said that all accounts of learning
 should appear under the title of Grecian. It was not,
however, because of this proclivity that it obtained its classical
 name: it was kept by a Greek named Constantine. Apart
 from its being naturally frequented by the lawyers, the
 scientific elite went there, as we gather from <persName key="Thoresby,Ralph">Thoresby</persName>,
 June 12, <date value="1712">1712</date>:  'Attended the Royal Society, where I found
Dr. Douglas dissecting a dolphin, lately caught in the <placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName>,

the Grecian Coffee House.'  The Guildhall Coffee House still
survives.</p>
   <p>Jonathan's was essentially a stockjobbers' house, and was
in Exchange Alley, as was also Baker's, which had a similar
clientele.   'I have been taken for a Merchant upon the
Exchange for above these Ten Years, and sometimes pass for
a Jew in the assembly of Stock Jobbers at Jonathan's,'  writes
<persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName> in the first number of the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>.  ' Stock Jobbers
busie at Jonathan's from Twelve to Three,'  says <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName>. The
<placeName key="St. James's">St. James's</placeName> was as thoroughly a Whig house as White's was
Tory; and  'Foreign and Domestic News you will have from
<placeName key="St. James's Coffee House">St. James's Coffee House</placeName>'  was part of the <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi> programme.
We have seen how <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> used it, and how his letters used to
be directed there; but what he wrote to Stella was hardly the
reason of his frequenting the house. He seems to have got
on very friendly terms with Elliot, the proprietor, rather early
in his London career, for he writes:  ' I dined to day with poor
Lord Mountjoy, who is ill of the gout; and this evening I
christened our Coffeeman Elliot's child; where the rogue had
a most noble supper, and <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName> and I sat among some scurvy
company over a bowl of punch, so that I am come home late,
young woman, and cannot stay to write to little rogues.'  <note place="foot" n="15"><hi rend="italics">Journal to Stella</hi>, Nov. 19, <date value="1710">1710</date>.</note>
The Jamaica is still in existence, although not where it was
in Anne's reign. It was then in Cornhill,  'by the Ship and
Castle.'  The Jerusalem was then, as it used to be not so
long since,  'near Garraway's.' </p>
   <p>Lloyd's was then in Lombard Street, and indeed to this
day, on Lloyd's policies, is stated that this policy shall have
the same effect as if issued in Lombard Street.  'And it is
agreed by us the Insurers, that this Writing or Policy of
Assurance shall be of as much Force and Effect as the surest
Writing or Policy of Assurance heretofore made in Lombard
Street, or in the <placeName key="Royal Exchange">Royal Exchange</placeName>, or elsewhere in London.'

 mention this coffee-house; and for mercantile purposes it shared, with the Marine in Birchin
Lane, the reputation of being the busiest. Here were sales
of wine and ships, and the latter business is still transacted
there.</p>



<pb id="p.225" n="225"/>

    <p>A curious custom obtained in this reign-that of selling
 goods, notably wines, by  'the Candle.'  <persName key="Pepys,Samuel">Pepys</persName> notes it in his
 diary as being new to him, so that it had not been long in
 vogue.  Lloyd's and the Marine Coffee Houses were the
 principal places where these singular auctions were held.
    When the custom died out I cannot learn, but probably
 it was during the first quarter of this century. The latest
 account I can find of its being practised is in The Saturday
 Bristol Times and Mirror of March 29, <date value="1873">1873</date>.  'Sale by
 Candle. The practice of letting by inch of Candle still
prevails in the County of Dorset. At the annual letting of the
-parish meadow of Broadway, near Weymouth, which occurred
a few weeks ago, an inch of candle was placed on a piece of
board nine inches square, and lighted by one of the parish
officers. The biddings were taken down by one of the parish
officers, and the chance of taking the meadow was open to
all while the candle was burning.  The last bidder before
the candle went out was the incoming tenant.  This year
the candle was extinguished suddenly.  The land, about
two acres in extent, was in <date value="1624">1624</date> presented to the poor by
William Gould, the object of the gift being to keep the poor
from working on the highways.'  The custom, for aught I
know, may still exist in some out-of-the-way places.</p>
  <p>Information on maritime matters was even then forwarded
to Lloyd's (although his News was not published after Feb.
23, <date value="1696">1696</date>, till <date value="1726">1726</date>), as is shown by the following episode:
 'London, August 4th. Yesterday Morning a Letter was sent
by the Penny Post to Mr. Edward Lloyd, Coffee man, in
Lombard Street; which letter was subscrib'd Jo. Browne, was
dated from on Board the Little St. Lewis off Bantry Bay in
Ireland. July. 22. and contain'd in Substance, That the said
Browne coming in a Vessel of which he was Master, from the
Bay of Campeachy for Ireland, was taken by the said little
St. Lewis, a French Frigate of 30 Guns, the 14th of July.' <note place="foot" n="18">
<hi rend="italics">Daily Courant</hi>, Aug. 4, <date value="1704">1704</date>.</note>
He then went on circumstantially to relate how an officer on
board had told him that the French had taken the Island of
St. Helena and fifteen English East India ships; and that
the fleet intended to sail for the Cape, to intercept our outward-bound

<pb n="226" id="p.226"/>

East India ships. The editorial comment on
this news is:  ''Tis very probable this Letter is a Forgery, but
as we cannot possibly determine whether it be or not, and
the Story having made a great Noise in Town, we found
ourselves oblig'd to give an Account of it.'   It turned out a
hoax, for, next day, Lloyd received a letter saying that the
rumour had served its turn.  'To which Mr. Lloyd thinks fit
to Answer.   Sir, Whoever you are that wrote these two
letters to Mr. Lloyd, he makes it his Request to you, that
you would please to Confirm your Willingness to take off the
Amusement made by the first, by writing him a third Letter
in the same Hand the first was, which the second is not.'
Lloyd died on Feb. 15, <date value="1713">1713</date>.</p>
   <p>There were several coffee-houses kept by persons of the
name of Man. There was Old Man's, Young Man's, Man's
New Coffee House, Charing Cross, Man's in Birchin Lane,
and Man's in Chancery Lane, opposite Lincoln's Inn Gate.
Old Man's was in the Tilt Yard, <placeName key="Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName>, and was the
rendezvous for officers in the army. The Paymaster-General's
office is now built upon its site. It was kept by the

with the superfine air of the place, and says of its frequenters,
 'their whole Exercise being to Charge and Discharge their

in a Country Chimney, not with their talking, but with their
Whispering over their New Minuets and Bories, with their
Hands in their Pockets, if freed from their Snush Box ....
Amongst them were abundance of Officers, or Men who by
their Habit appear'd to be such; but look'd as tenderly, as if
they Carried their Down beds with them into the Camp, and
did not dare to come out of their Tents, in a cold morning,

this while looking about us, like a Couple of Minerva's Birds,

we Ventur'd to call for some Instruments of Evaporation,
which were accordingly brought us, but with such a Kind of

  <p> John Salter's (or, as he was christened by <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>, or Rear
Admiral Sir John Munden,  'Don Saltero' ) was situated in
the middle of Cheyne Walk, <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>. He was originally a
servant to Sir Hans Sloane, and, when he left his service to
set up as barber and coffee-house keeper, Sir Hans gave him
some odds and ends from his Museum. Other kind friends
followed, and Don Saltero's became a place of note, the
curiosities, natural and otherwise, taking up much of the
space. Indeed, <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>,
in recording a visit to the Don's, says, <note place="foot" n="24"><hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, No. 34.</note>
 'When I came into the Coffee house, I had not time to salute
the Company, before my eye was diverted by ten thousand
jimcracks round the room and on the ceiling.'  The first
catalogue of his curiosities that he published, was in <date value="1729">1729</date>,
and in the preface he says,  'The first Donor was the
Honourable Sir John Cope, bart., to whom and Family I am much
obliged for several very valuable pieces, both of Nature and
Art.'  The list comprises 249 articles, which in the 12th
edition, <date value="1741">1741</date>, was increased to 420, so that, probably, in Anne's
time there were not more than a couple of hundred. Apart
from the natural curiosities, which were numerous, were
many undoubtedly spurious, as  '(2) Painted Ribbands from
Jerusalem with the Pillar, to which our Saviour was tied
when scourged, with a Motto on each.'   '(40) The Queen of
Sheba's Fan.'  He seems to have invested largely in this
royal lady's property, for we have  '(53) Queen of Sheba's
Cordial Bottle,'  and  '(55) The Queen of Sheba's Milk Maid's
Hat.'  No. 56 was  'Pontius Pilate's Wife's Chambermaid's


<pb n="230" id="p.230"/>

Sister's Sister's Hat' -a relic which, <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName> declares, was
made within three miles of Bedford.</p>
<p>   These rather detract from the possible authenticity of the
historical relics, which were numerous, and, if genuine, were
curious and valuable.  '(15) A Wooden Shoe put under the
Speaker's Chair in K. James IId's Time.'   '(37) Gustavus
Adolphus's Gloves.'   '(38) Harry VIIIth's Coat of Mail.'
 '(39) Queen Elizabeth's Stirrup.'   '(41) Katherine Q.
Dowager's Coronation Shoes.'   '(42) King Charles IId's Band, which
he wore in Disguise in the Royal Oak.'   '(43) William the
Conqueror's Flaming Sword.'   '(44) Oliver's Sword.'   '(45)King
James IId's Coronation Shoes.'   '(46) King William the IIId's
Coronation Sword.'   '(47) King William's Coronation Shoes.'
 '(49) Queen Anne's Testament.'  (50)  'Henry the VIIIth's
Gloves.'   '(51) The Czar of Moscow's Gloves ;'  and last but
not least-an undeniable forgery,  '(242) Robinson Crusoe's
and his Man Friday's Shirts.' </p>
  <p> <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName> describes the Don as  'a sage of a thin and meagre
countenance; which aspect made me doubt whether reading
or fretting had made it so philosophic; but I very soon
perceived him to be of that sect which the ancients call Gingivistae;
in our language, tooth drawers.'  Besides shaving and tooth
drawing, he played on the violin:  'if he would wholly give
himself up to the string, instead of playing twenty beginnings
to tunes, he might, before he dies, play Roger de Caubly <note place="foot" n="25">See Appendix.</note>
quite out. I heard him go through his whole round, and
indeed he does play the  " Merry Christ Church Bells " <note place="foot" n="26">See Appendix.</note>
 pretty justly;'  and another authority says,  'There was no passing
his house, if he was at home, without having one's ears grated
with the sounds of his fiddle, on which he scraped most
execrably.'  <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName> recommends some of his curiosities to be
taken away,  'or else he may expect to have his letters patent
for making punch superseded, be debarred wearing his Muff
next winter, or ever coming to London without his wife.'
Either of these would have punished Saltero severely, for he
was known out of doors by his old grey muff, which he carried
up to his nose; and Mrs. S. had a temper of her own, to
escape which the Don sometimes slipped off to London by



<pb n="231" id="p.231"/>

himself. His collection seems to have dwindled away, for
when it was sold in <date value="1799">1799</date> there were only 121 lots, and the
whole seem to have sold for a little over 50&#x00A3;.</p>
    <p>Slaughter's Coffee House in <persName key="St. Martin's Lane">St. Martin's Lane</persName> afterwards
superseded Old Man's as a military meeting-place, and in
the latter half of the century it was frequented by artists
and sculptors. Searl's, or Serle's, was a legal coffee-house,
and was situated at the corner of Lincoln's Inn Fields. Of
Tom's-I have a list of six-perhaps the best known was
that in <persName key="St. Martin's Lane">St. Martin's Lane</persName>, where, as we have seen, was one of
the first insurance offices. The Virginia, which was in St.
Michael's Alley, and afterwards in Cornhill, has disappeared
within the last few years.</p>
<p>     'All accounts of POETRY, under Will's Coffee House,'
says the <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>; it was situated No. I Bow Street, at the
corner of Russell Street, and took its name from its proprietor,
William Urwin. If <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName> can be trusted, gamblers as well
as wits frequented it, for he says there was  'great shaking
of the Elbow at Wills about Ten.'  Still it was, par
excellence, the Wits coffee house, a class who are very happily
described by a contemporary writer:
<note place="foot" n="27"><hi rend="italics">Hickelty Pickelty</hi>.</note>  'All their words go
for Jests, and all their Jests for nothing. They are quick in
the Fancy of some ridiculous Thing, and reasonable good in
the Expression. Nothing stops a Jest when it is coming;
and they had rather lose their Friend than their Wit.'  And
they are also written of as being  'Conceited, if they had but
once the Honour to dip a finger and thumb in Mr. D--'s <note place="foot" n="28"><persName key="DrydenJohn">Dryden</persName>'s.</note>
snush box, it was enough to inspire 'em with a true Genius of
Poetry, and make 'em write Verse, as fast as a Taylor takes
his stitches.'  In fact, it was on <persName key="DrydenJohn">Dryden</persName>'s reputation that
Will's coffee-house was then living; and his going there is
noticed by <persName key="Pepys,Samuel">Pepys</persName>,  'Feb. 3, <date value="1664">1664</date>-In <placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName> to-night,
going to fetch my wife, I stopped at the great Coffee house
there, where I never was before: where <persName key="DrydenJohn">Dryden</persName>, the poet, I
knew at <placeName key="Cambridge">Cambridge</placeName>, and all the wits of the town, and Harris
the player, and Mr. Hoole, of our College. And, had I time
then, or could at other times, it will be good coming thither,
<note place="foot" n="29"> <hi rend="italics">A Comical View of London and <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.</hi></note>


<pb n="232" id="p.232"/>


for there, I perceive, is very witty and pleasant discourse.
But I could not tarry, and, as it was late, they were all ready
to go away.'  Here also <persName key="Pope, Alexander">Pope</persName> saw the old man, whom he
described as  'a plump man with a down look, and not very
conversible.' </p>
   <p>Such, then, were some of the principal coffee-houses.
What were the taverns like ? There were then no hotels
proper, such as we know them: a man had to live in private
apartments, and, when he wanted dinner, he had to betake
himself to a tavern, or ordinary. As <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName> remarks,  ' At
London they hardly so much as know what an Auberge is:
There are indeed a thousand and a thousand Taverns, where
you may have what you please got for you.'  A tavern was a
far more free-and-easy place than a coffee-house-in fact, it
is a question whether the convenances of a coffee-house
would admit of a man  'washing his teeth at a tavern window
in Pall Mall' ; <note place="foot" n="30"><hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, II.</note>
 indeed, the keeping of them was hardly
considered reputable, for we find <note place="foot" n="31"><hi rend="italics"><persName key="Luttrell,Narcissus">Luttrell</persName></hi>, Jan. 1, <date value="1709">1709</date>.  </note>
 that  'Her Majestie sign'd a warrant for continuing the salaries of the prince's servants
during her life, provided they kept no publick houses.' </p>
  <p> <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName> describes
 <note place="foot" n="32"><hi rend="italics">London Spy</hi>.</note> the freedom and jollity of these places:
 'Accordingly we stept in, and in the Kitchen found half a
dozen of my Friends Associates, in the height of their Jollitry,
as Merry as so many Cantabridgians at Sturbridge Fair, or
Coblers at a Crispins Feast. After a Friendly Salutation, free
from all Foppish Ceremonies, down we sat; and when a
Glass or two round had given fresh Motion to our drowsy
Spirits, and abandon'd all those careful thoughts which
makes Man's Life uneasie, Wit begot Wit, and Wine a Thirsty
Appetite to each Succeeding Glass. Then open were our
Hearts and unconfined our Fancies; my Friend and I
contributed our Mites to add to the Treasure of our Felicity.
Songs and Catches Crown'd the Night, and each Man in his
Turn pleased his Ears with his own Harmony.' </p>
 <p>  The most singular thing was, that it was not at all
derogatory for a nobleman or gentleman to go to a tavern for
a carouse-and all clubs were held at taverns. <persName key="Thoresby,Ralph">Thoresby</persName>
relates that, after his reception by the Queen, as one of a


<pb n="233" id="p.233"/>

deputation from Leeds, on July 2, <date value="1712">1712</date>,  'We left the Duke
there, but returned in the High Sheriff's coach to Sir Arthur
<figure id="fig.40" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00040"><head>A TAVERN SCENE.</head></figure>

Kaye's, who, with Sir Bryan Stapleton, accompanied us;
from Sir Arthur's we went to the Tavern to drink her
<pb n="234" id="p.234"/>

Majesty's health, and stayed full late.'  And <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> writes to
Stella: <note place="foot" n="33"><hi rend="italics">Journal</hi>, Oct. 27, <date value="1710">1710</date>.</note>
  'After dinner we went to a blind tavern, where
Congreve, Sir Richard Temple, Eastcourt, and Charles Main
were over a bowl of bad punch. The Knight sent for six
flasks of his own wine for me, and we staid till twelve.'  This
sending for one's own wine was a peculiar arrangement, but
doubtless the landlord was satisfied with a premium on
 'corkage.'  <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> frequently speaks of this custom:
 'Today I dined with Lewis and Prior at an eating house, but
with Lewis's wine.'   'I dined in a Coffee house with Stratford
upon Chops, and some of his Wine.'  Again he was with
Lords Harley and Dupplin, the son and son-in-law of the
Earl of Oxford-and  'we were forced to go to a tavern, and
send for wine from Lord Treasurer's.' </p>
  <p> But the frequenters of taverns were not all so respectable
as these examples; and <persName key="Brown,Thomas">Brown</persName> supplies particulars of another
section of society.  'A Tavern is a little Sodom, where as many
Vices are daily practised, as ever were known in the great
one; Thither Libertines repair to drink away their Brains,
Aldermen to talk Treason, and bewail the loss of Trade;
Saints to elevate the Spirit, hatch Calumnies, coin false
News, and reproach the Church; Gamesters to shake their
Elbows; Thither Sober Knaves walk with Drunken Fools to
make Cunning Bargains and overreach them in their Dealings;
Thither Young Quality retire to spend their Tradesmens
Money; Thither Bullies Coach it to Kick Drawers, and
invent new Oaths and Curses; Thither run Sots purely to be
drunk, Beaux to shew their Vanity, Cowards to make
themselve valiant by the Strength of their Wine, Fools to make
themselves witty in their own Conceits, and Spendthrifts to
be made Miserable by a Ridiculous Consumption of their
own Fortunes.' </p>
 <p>  There were lower depths yet: there were the purl houses,
where  'Tradesmen flock in their Morning gowns, by Seven,
to cool their Plucks,'  and the mug houses, <note place="foot" n="34"> 'Here is nothing drunk but Ale, and every Gentleman hath his separate
Mug, which he Chalks on the Table, where he sits, as it is brought in; and every
one retires when he pleases, as from a Coffee House.' -A Journey through
England, <date value="1722">1722</date>.</note> which in <persName key="GeorgeI.">George the First's </persName>


<pb n="235" id="p.235"/>

time were made into political clubs.  'King George
for Ever'  was then the mug-house cry, which the coffee-houses
countered with  'High Church and Ormonde; no
Presbyterians; no Hanover; down with the Mug.' </p>
   <p>The following is a list of the principal taverns then in
existence, for some of which I am indebted to Timbs  ' Club
Life of London.'   'The Bear,'  at the foot of London Bridge,
Southwark and west side, which was in existence in <date value="1463">1463</date>,
was not pulled down till <date value="1761">1761</date>.  The  'Boar's Head,'  in
<placeName key="Eastcheap">Eastcheap</placeName>; Pontack's, in Abchurch Lane; and the  ' Pope's Head'
tavern in Pope's Head Alley, were all standing; and the
 'Cock,'  in Threadneedle Street, was only destroyed in <date value="1851">1851</date>.
There was the  'Salutation'  in Newgate Street, where <persName key="Wren,Christopher">Wren</persName>
used to smoke his pipe, whilst <placeName key="St. Paul's">St. Paul's</placeName> was rebuilding.
Dolly's chop-house, in Paternoster Row, was established in
Queen Anne's reign.  The  'White Hart'  in Bishopsgate
Without, which bore the date <date value="1480">1480</date>, was not pulled down till
<date value="1829">1829</date>. The  'King's Head,'  in Fenchurch Street, at the corner
of Mark Lane, was the hostel at which Queen Elizabeth is
said to have dined in May <date value="1554">1554</date>. The  'Devil,'  in <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>,
now occupied by Childs' bank, was flourishing, and
<persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName> describes
it <note place="foot" n="35"><hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, 79.</note>
as  'a place sacred to mirth tempered with discretion, where <persName key="Jonson,Ben">Ben Jonson</persName>
and his Sons used to make their liberal meetings,'  and he says that in the Apollo room were
the rules of Ben's Club, painted in gold letters over the
chimney piece.</p>
   <p>This tavern was so popular that a rival sprung up on the
other side of the street, the  'Young Devil,'  and here, for a
year or so, from the beginning of <date value="1708">1708</date>, till some time in or
about <date value="1709">1709</date>, the Society of Antiquaries held their meetings,
afterwards at the  'Fountain'  tavern, <placeName key="Inner Temple Gate">Inner Temple Gate</placeName>.
The  'Cock,'  in <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, has only just been demolished.
There was another famous tavern which was near St.
Dunstan's Church, in <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, called  'The Hercules' Pillars,'
which was visited by <persName key="Pepys,Samuel">Pepys</persName>, as appears by four entries in his
diary. Another tavern of this name, at Charing Cross, will
be noted when treating of the amusements of the people



<pb n="236" id="p.236"/>

The  ' Mitre'  tavern must not be confounded with the
coffeehouse of that name in Mitre Court, but was the one
frequented by Dr. Johnson, and so often referred to by
Boswell.</p>
   <p>The  'Palsgrave's Head,'  on the south side of <placeName key="the Strand">the Strand</placeName>,
near <placeName key="Temple Bar">Temple Bar</placeName>, was then a coffee-house, and was so named
from the Palsgrave Frederick, afterwards King of Bohemia,
who married the Princess Elizabeth, daughter of James I.
The  'Crown and Anchor,'  which stretched along <placeName key="the Strand">the Strand</placeName>
from Arundel Street to Milford Lane, was famous as being
the place where the Academy of Music was instituted in
<date value="1710">1710</date>. The  'Rose'  tavern in <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName> is frequently
mentioned in the literature of this time. It was afterwards
absorbed into <placeName key="Drury Lane Theatre">Drury Lane Theatre</placeName>, when Garrick enlarged
it in <date value="1776">1776</date>. The  'Rummer Tavern,'  at Charing Cross, near
Locket's Ordinary, is often mentioned in advertisements, and
<persName key="Brown,Thomas">Brown</persName> and <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName> speak of  'Heaven'  and  ' Hell,'  which were
two ale-houses near <placeName key="Westminster Hall">Westminster Hall</placeName>. <persName key="Pepys,Samuel">Pepys</persName> notices one of
them on January 28, <date value="1660">1660</date>- ' And so I returned, and went to

the  'Bumper'  tavern, which  'Dick Estcourt,'  the actor, opened
on January I, <date value="1712">1712</date>, and which <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName> so kindly puffed in
<hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> No. 264. An exhaustive catalogue of the taverns
in the City is given by <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName> in his  'Vade Mecum for

hardly worth while to reproduce their names, even in an

<p>THE name of Club, is undoubtedly taken from the practice
of a jovial company to  'club,'  or divide the whole expenses
of the entertainment; and  'the payment of our Clubs'  <note place="foot" n="1"><hi rend="italics">London Spy</hi>.</note>
 is a frequently mentioned wind-up of any festivity. Naturally,
such agreeable meetings were repeated until they became
habitual, and the society, or club, was formed; and these
humble beginnings laid the foundation of that great social
organisation which nowhere flourishes better than in
England.</p>
   <p>The principal clubs of Queen Anne's time were the
<orgName key="October Club">October Club</orgName>, the <orgName key="Calves Head Club">Calves Head Club</orgName>, and the <orgName key="Kit Cat Club">Kit Cat Club</orgName>.
The <orgName key="October Club">October Club</orgName> was a Political Club, of high Tory
proclivities, and it was so called from the  'October Ale'  which
was supposed to be the drink of the members. It was held
at the  'Bell Tavern,'  in <placeName key="King Street">King Street</placeName>, <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, and they
succeeded in plaguing the Whigs to their hearts' content.
<persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> writes Stella of them :<note place="foot" n="2"><hi rend="italics">Journal</hi>, Feb. 18, <date value="1711">1711</date>.</note>
  'We are plagued here with an <orgName key="October Club">October Club</orgName>; that is, a set of above a hundred Parliament
men of the Country, who drink October beer at home, and
meet every evening at a tavern near the Parliament, to
consult affairs, and drive things on to extremes against the
Whigs, to call the old ministry to account, and get off five
or six heads. The ministry seem not to regard them, yet
one of them in confidence, told me that there must be
something thought on to settle things better.'  <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> wrote a little
pamphlet called  'Some Advice Humbly Offered to the



<pb n="238" id="p.238"/>

Members of the <orgName key="October Club">October Club</orgName>, in a letter from a Person of
Honour,'  which met with varying fortunes; for he tells Stella,
 'The little twopenny letter of  "Advice to the <orgName key="October Club">October Club</orgName>,"
does not sell: I know the reason; for it is finely written, I
assure you; and like a true author, I grow fond of it, because
it does not sell: you know that it is usual to writers to
condemn the judgment of the world; if I had hinted it to
be mine, every body would have bought it, but it is a great
secret.' <note place="foot" n="3">Journal, Jan. 28, <date value="1712">1712</date>.</note>    A few days later, and he writes, February 1, that
it  'begins now to sell; but I believe its fame will hardly
reach Ireland.'  There is no doubt but that it partially had
the desired effect-of making these troublesome gentlemen
less obstructive. Poor <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> was once nearly getting into a
dilemma with regard to this club, and his story is as follows:
 'Then Ford drew me to dine at a tavern, it happened to be the
day and the house where the <orgName key="October Club">October Club</orgName> dine. After we
had dined, coming down, we called to inquire, whether our
yarn business had been over that day, and I sent into the
room for Sir George Beaumont. But I had like to be drawn
into a difficulty; for in two minutes out comes Mr. Finch,
Lord Guernsey's son, to let me know, that my Lord Compton,
the steward of this feast, desired, in the name of the club,
that I would do them the honour to dine with them. I sent
my excuses, adorned with about thirty compliments, and got
off as fast as I could. It would have been a most improper
thing for me to dine there, considering my friendship for the
Ministry. The Club is about a hundred and fifty, and near
eighty of them were then going to dinner at two long tables
in a great ground room.'  <note place="foot" n="4"><hi rend="italics">Ibid.</hi> April 13, <date value="1714">1714</date>.</note> Afterwards the <orgName key="October Club">October Club</orgName> was

   <p>The author tells the history of the club as follows:
 'Happening in the late Reign to be in the Company of a
certain active Whigg, who in all other Respects was a Man of
probity enough; he assured me, that to his Knowledge, 'twas
true, That he knew most of the Members of that Club, and
that he had been often invited to their Meetings, but that he
had always avoided them: Adding, that according to the
Principles he was bred up in, he wou'd have made no scruple
to have met Charles the First, in the Field, and oppos'd him
to the utmost of his Power; but that since he was Dead, he
had no further Quarrel to him, and looked upon it as a
cowardly piece of Villany, below any Man of Honour, to
insult upon a Memory of a Prince, who had suffer'd enough
in his Life Time.
   'He farther told me, that Milton, and some other Creatures
of the Commonwealth, had instituted this Club, as he was

up in the Club Room, and was reverenced as a principal Symbol in this Diabolical
Sacrament. Their Bill of Fare was a large Dish of Calves-Heads, dressed several
ways, by which they represented the King and his Friends, who had suffer'd in
his Cause; a large Pike with a small one in his Mouth, as an Emblem of Tyranny;
a large Cod's Head, by which they pretended to represent the Person of the King
singly; a Boar's Head with an Apple in its Mouth, to represent the King, by
this, as Beastial, as by their other Hieroglyphicks they had done Foolish and
Tyrannical. After the Repast was over, one of their Elders presented an Ikon
Basilike, which was with great Solemnity burn'd upon the Table, whilst the
Anthems were singing. After this, another produc'd Milton's Defensio Populi
Anglicani, upon which all laid their Hands, and made a Protestation in the form
of an Oath, for ever to stand by, and maintain the same;' then the text goes on
as above.</note> that the

this Remark); that the Famous Jerry White, formerly
Chaplain to Oliver Cromwell, who, no doubt on 't, came to sanctify
with his Pious Exhortations, the Ribbaldry of the Day, said
Grace; that after the Table Cloth was removed, the
Anniversary Anthem, as they impiously call'd it, was sung, and
a Calves Scull filled with Wine or other Liquor, and then a
Brimmer went about to the Pious Memory of those worthy
Patriots that had kill'd the Tyrant, and deliver'd their
Country from his Arbitrary Sway; and lastly, a Collection made
for the Mercenary Scribler, to which every Man contributed
according to his Zeal for the Cause, or the Ability of his
Purse.' </p>

  <p>Whether this  'Secret History'  be true or not, it would
almost appear that there was a <orgName key="Calves Head Club">Calves Head Club</orgName> in George

exist of this occurrence, variously modifying it, until they
end in a total denial; but engravings exist professing to

in the <date value="1714">1714</date> edition of the  'Secret History'  is an engraving
of  'the <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> Calf's Head Club,'  which is none other

   <p>Perhaps one of the now best-known clubs of Anne's time
was the <orgName key="Kit Cat Club">Kit Cat</orgName>, which derived its peculiar cognomen (so
<persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName> says)  'from a Mutton Pye.'  Attempts have been
made to attribute its origin to a political gathering of Whig


<pb n="242" id="p.242"/>

noblemen and gentlemen, but contemporary authorities all
agree that it was founded by Jacob Tonson, the bookseller;
and Sir R. Blackmore, who wrote a poem called  'the Kitcats'
in <date value="1708">1708</date>, may be considered as knowing something about
what he wrote. Whether the pieman's name was Christopher

does not much matter: certain it is that the pies from which
the club was named were called Kit Cat's pies.</p>
   <p>Various domiciles have been given to the club, but Sir
R. Blackmore says it was held at the Fountain in <placeName key="the Strand">the Strand</placeName>,

   <p>Another proof, if it were needed, that Tonson was the
founder of the club, is that forty-two of its members
presented him with their portraits, painted by Sir Godfrey
Kneller, to adorn his house at Barn Elms. As the room
was not lofty enough to admit of their being the regulation
size, special canvases were had (36 x 28 in.), and this is
still called Kit Cat size. These portraits are still in
existence, and were all shown at the Art Treasures Exhibition
at Manchester, and some at the International Exhibition of

    <p>There were numerous social clubs, the Beefsteak, and
the Saturday Club, of which <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName> makes frequent mention
in his letters to Stella. Take one instance <note place="foot" n="10"><hi rend="italics">Journal to Stella</hi>, Jan. 9, <date value="1713">1713</date>.
</note> :  'I dined with lord-treasurer, and shall again to-morrow, which is his day,
when all the ministers dine with him. He calls it whipping
day. It is always on Saturday, and we do indeed usually
rally him about his faults on that day. I was of the original
club, when only poor Lord Rivers, lord keeper, and Lord
Bolinbroke came; but now Ormond, Anglesey, lord Steward,
Dartmouth, and other rabble intrude, and I scold at it; but
now they pretend as good a title as I; and, indeed, many
Saturdays I am not there.'  He also belonged to a club or
society for social converse and the encouragement of
literature, which was founded in the latter part of the year <date value="1712">1712</date>.
Its meetings were on Thursday, and it was the custom of the
members to entertain their brethren in turns. He gave one
dinner at the Thatched House <note place="foot" n="11"><hi rend="italics">Ibid.</hi> Feb. 21, <date value="1712">1712</date>.</note>:  'it will cost me five or six

as  'The Duke of Ormond's treat last week cost &#x00A3;pound;pound;20 though
it was only four dishes, and four without a dessert; and I

<p>BUT clubs were not the only social enjoyments. The populace
had, during this reign, many free sights-and the numerous
visits of the Queen to the City provided fine shows gratis.
She dined at Guildhall on the Lord Mayor's day after her
accession, and she visited the City again on November 12
the same year, accompanied by both Houses of Parliament, to
return thanks for the successes at Vigo. Certainly January 19,
<date value="1704">1704</date>, was kept as a fast; but on September 7 of that year
the Queen again went to <placeName key="St. Paul's">St. Paul's</placeName>, in commemoration of the
victory at Blenheim and the capture of Gibraltar; and on
January 3, <date value="1705">1705</date>, the standards <note place="foot" n="1">There was an engraving made of these standards; and a handbill about it

carried, by a detachment of horse and foot guards, from the
Tower, and hung up in <placeName key="Westminster Hall">Westminster Hall</placeName>.         On the 6th of
the same month the Duke of Marlborough dined, by

June 27, <date value="1706">1706</date>. This time, the colours taken were deposited
in the Guildhall, with great pomp, on December 19, <date value="1706">1706</date>:
the Queen, and Prince George, going into <placeName key="St. James's Park">St. James's Park</placeName>
to see them pass. On this occasion the Duke dined with
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, in Vintners' Hall. On
December 30 of the same year, the Queen gave thanks at
<placeName key="St. Paul's">St. Paul's</placeName> for the successes of the last campaign in Spain and
Italy; and, as the newspaper account informs us,  'the Night
ended with Ringing of Bells, Bonfires, Illuminations, and
other Rejoycings.' </p>
   <p>Yet again was there another day of public rejoicing, on
May 1, <date value="1707">1707</date>, to celebrate the union with Scotland, and the
Queen once more visited <placeName key="St. Paul's">St. Paul's</placeName>. But this was to be the
last. On thanksgiving day, July 7, <date value="1713">1713</date>, to celebrate the
conclusion of peace, Anne was too unwell to play her
accustomed part, and was reluctantly compelled to abandon it and
remain at home. The fireworks on this occasion were splendid.

about Eleven; when those upon the <placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName>, over against
<placeName key="Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName>, began, and lasted till after Midnight. Besides that

that we have not heard of the least Mischief done either upon
the River or in <placeName key="Smithfield">Smithfield</placeName>;'  and, as was observed in the
<hi rend="italics">Guardian</hi>, No. 103:  'In short, the artist did his part to
admiration, and was so encompassed with fire and smoke
that one would have thought nothing but a Salamander
could have been safe in such a situation.'  But these seem
to have been eclipsed by a display at Dublin in honour of
the Queen's last birthday, February 6, <date value="1714">1714</date>, as is recorded
in the <hi rend="italics">Daily Courant</hi> of February 16, <date value="1714">1714</date>.</p>
   <p>The Londoner, too, had his Lord Mayor's Show, with its
fun, perhaps just a trifle rougher than in our day. Owing
to the difference of old and new style, Lord Mayor's day
was on October 29 instead of November 9 as now. <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName>

the lions, the tombs, Bedlam.' <note place="foot" n="3"><hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, No. 30.</note>  These were the three great
sights of London: the lions at the Tower, the tombs in
<placeName key="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</placeName>, and the poor mad folk in Bedlam.  'To
see the lions '  is proverbial, and these had to be visited by
every one new to the City. In <date value="1703">1703</date> there were four, two
lions and two lionesses-one with a cub. In this reign three
of the lions died almost at the same time, and it was looked
upon by some as an event of dire portent. <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName>
laughingly alludes to the popular idea of something awful happening
on the death of a  'Tower'  lion, when, in the Freeholder, he
makes the Jacobite squire ask the keeper whether any of the
lions had fallen sick when Perth was taken, or on the flight
of the Pretender. When dead they were sometimes stuffed,
as <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName> relates. He also says there was a leopard, three
eagles, two owls, and a hyena.  That was in <date value="1703">1703</date>; and
<persName key="Thoresby,Ralph">Thoresby</persName>, writing in <date value="1709">1709</date>, went to see the  'lions, eagles,

<note place="foot" n="4"><hi rend="italics">Diary</hi>, Jan. 21, <date value="1709">1709</date>.</note> his experiences
of a visit to the Tower itself:  'Walked with Mr. Dale to the
Tower; was mightily pleased with the new and excellent
method the Records <note place="foot" n="5">The records were kept in the Tower until the present reign.</note>
 are put into (of which see a letter of
the Bishop of Carlisle to me;) and viewed many great
curiosities of that nature, and original letters from foreign kings
and potentates, upon parchment, and paper as old (reckoned
as great a rarity) to the Kings of England, very ancient
tallies, Jewish stars, &amp;c., which the obliging Mr. Holms showed


<pb n="248" id="p.248"/>

me, who also gave me an autograph of Queen Elizabeth, that
was his own property; then went to view the several armouries,
as that more ancient of the weapons taken in the year <date value="1588">1588</date>
from the pretended Invincible Armada, and those modern
from Vigo, and in other memorable transactions of this age;
the present armoury for use is put to a surprising method, in
the form of shields, pyramids, trophies, &amp;c. Some of the
elder and later kings' armour are placed as though mounted
on horseback.' </p>
   <p><persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName> also visited the Tower, after seeing the lions, and
has left a most amusing account of what he saw, which is far
too long for transcription. He first noted  ' a parcel of Bulky
Wardens, in old fashion'd Lac'd Jackets, and in Velvet Flat
caps, hung round with divers colour'd Ribbonds, like a Fool's
hat upon a Holiday.'  Indeed, their costume was identical
with their present state dress, only it was utterly marred by
their wearing portentous periwigs. Under the guidance of
one of these gentry he was shown Traitor's Gate, the White
Tower, and St. Peter's Church; and afterwards, the Grand
Armoury, where he was particularly delighted to see that  'at
the corner of every Lobby, and turning of the Stairs, stood a
Wooden Granadier as Sentinel, painted in his proper Colours,
cut out with much exactness upon Board.'  Arrived in the
arsenal, he was handed over to one of the armourer's men,
who had  'everything as ready at his fingers' ends, as the
Fellow that shows the Tombs at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. The first
Figure at our Coming in, that most effected the Eye, by
reason of its bigness, was a long Range of Muskets and
Carbines, that ran the length of the Armory, which was
distinguish'd by a Wilderness of Arms, whose Locks and Barrels
were kept in that admirable Order, that they shone as bright
as a Good Housewifes Spits and Pewter in the Christmas
Holidays, on each side of which were Pistols, Baggonets,
Scimiters, Hangers, Cutlaces, and the like Configurated into
Shields, Triumphal Arches, Gates, Pillasters, Scollopshells,
Mullets, Fans, Snakes, Serpents, Sun Beams, Gorgon's Heads,
the Waves of the Ocean, Stars and Garters, and in the middle
of all, Pillars of Pikes, and turn'd Pillars of Pistols; and at
the end of the Wilderness, fire Arms plac'd in the Order of a


<pb n="249" id="p.249"/>

great Organ.'  Coming thence, he noticed the Tower rooks,
as he called those men who asked  'Whether you will see the
Crown, the whole Regalia or the King's Marching Train of
Artillery ?'  He would have none of them, but went with a
warder into the armoury proper, where he  'View'd the Princely
Scare crows, and he told us to whom each Suit of Armour
did belong Originally, adding some short Memorandums out
of History, to every empty Iron side; some True, some False,
supplying that with Invention, which he wanted in Memory.'
He would not see the Regalia, but got a description of it
from the warder,  'and so Cozened the Keeper of our Eighteen
Pence a piece.'  The warder told them  'there was a Royal
Crown, and a new one made for the Coronation of the late
Queen Mary, and three others wore by his Majesty with
Distinct Robes, upon several occasions; also the Salt, Spoons,
Forks and Cups, us'd at the Coronation.'  Altogether, a visit
to the Tower then very much resembled one nowadays.</p>
    <p>As to the tombs at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, what more do we want
to know about them, as they then were, than what is
contained in <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> No. 26, where <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName> grumbles at Sir
Cloudesley Shovel's monument,  'Instead of the brave rough
English Admiral, which was the distinguishing Character of
that plain gallant Man, he is represented on his Tomb, by
the Figure of a Beau, dress'd in a long Perriwig, and reposing
himself upon Velvet Cushions under a Canopy of State?'
And for all else in the grand old abbey, have we not the
lifelike description of Sir Roger's visit? <note place="foot" n="6"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, 329.</note> how he saw Jacob's
pillar, sat in the Coronation Chair, handled Edward the Third's
sword, and afterwards wanted the Spectator to call on him
 'at his Lodgings in Norfolk Buildings, and talk over these
Matters with him more at leisure.'  It would be a literary
profanity to deal with them except in their entirety.</p>
    <p>But the lions, the tombs, and Bedlam could never be
sufficient recreative pabulum for a large city, so there were
outlets for the exuberance of their spirits in the three fairs,
Bartholomew, May fair, and Southwark. Bartholomew fair
stands pre-eminent, both for its antiquity, its size, and length
of duration. In Anne's time it was no longer the great mart

<pb n="250" id="p.250"/>

for cloth it used to be-and the fair was given over to rioting
and unlimited licence. This fair is a most congenial subject
for <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName>'s pen, and he gives it free range-too free, alas! for
many extracts. He describes the entrance to it as a
 'Belfegor's Concert, the rumbling of Drums, mix'd with the
intolerable Squalling of Cat Calls and Penny Trumpets,'  so, to
get out of the noise and smell, prominent in which latter was
 'the Singeing of Pigs, and burnt Crackling of over Roasted
Pork'  (which was a specialty in the fair), he turned into an
ale house, where he had doctored beer, and was so annoyed
by a waiter, who would constantly inquire,  'Do you call,
sirs?'  that he threatened to kick him downstairs.  From
this upper room he could see the booths, and note the
humours of the fair: the mock finery of the actors, who were
 'strutting round their Balconies in their Tinsey Robes, and
Golden Leather Buskins;'  and the sorry buffoonery of the
Merry Andrews. Having rested, he sallied forth into the
fair, saw the rope-dancers, one of whom was a negress, who
set a countryman near <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName> into fits of laughter, which he
explained:  'Master, says he, I have oftentimes heard of the
Devil upon two Sticks, but never Zee it bevore in me Life.
Bezide, Maister, who can forbear Laughing to see the Devil
going to Dance ?'  He speaks in high terms of the German
rope-dancer, of whom Lauron gives two portraits. He then
went into a booth to see  'a Dwarf Comedy, Sir-nam'd a Droll,'
but does not seem to have cared much about it. He and his
friend then refreshed themselves with  'a Quart of Fill-birds,
and Eat each of us two Penny worth of Burgamy Pears,'  and
witnessed another performance. They then needed solid
food, so determined to have a quarter of a pig (sucking pig
of course), and made their way to Pye Corner,  'where Cooks
stood dripping at their Doors, like their Roasted Swine's
Flesh,'  but the total absence of cleanliness in the cookery was
so repulsive, that they had to forego the luxury.</p>
   <p>After undergoing the certain penalty of having his
handkerchief stolen, he went to see another droll, the plot of which
seems to have been perfectly inexplicable, and he came to
the conclusion that  'Bartholomew Fair Drolls are like State
Fire Works, they never do any Body good, but those that


<pb n="251" id="p.251"/>

are concern'd in the Show.'  The wax-work was then visited,
and then they went to a music and dancing booth, in which
they not only had a most discordant instrumental concert,
but saw a woman  'Dance with Glasses full of Liquor upon
the Backs of her Hands, to which she gave Variety of Motions,
without Spilling,'  and a youthful damsel perform a sword
dance, which was succeeded by  'abundance of Insipid Stuff.'
They got away, and passed by the  'Whirligigs,'  went into a
raffling shop, and the Groom Porter's, after which he went
to an alehouse to rest himself and smoke a pipe, and finally
went home, thoroughly tired.</p>
   <p>This, then, was a true record of a visit to Bartholomew
Fair, by the aid of which we shall thoroughly appreciate the
following advertisements of the amusements there :-</p>
   <p> 'At the great Booth over against the Hospital Gate,
during the time of Bartholomew Fair will be seen the Dancing
on the Ropes, after the French and Italian Fashion, by a
Company of the finest Performers that ever yet have been
seen by the whole World. For in the same Booth will be
seen the two Famous French Maidens, so much admired in
all Places and Countries wherever they come (especially in
Mayfair last), where they gain'd the highest Applause from
all the Nobility and Gentry, for their wonderful Performance
on the Rope, both with and without a Pole; so far out doing
all others that have been seen of their Sex, as gives a general
Satisfaction to all that ever yet beheld them. To which is
added, Vaulting on the High Rope, and Tumbling on the
Stage. As also Vaulting on two Horses, on the great Stage,
at once. The Stage being built after the Italian manner, on
which you will see the Famous Scaramouch and <hi rend="italics">Harl.</hi>quin.
With several other Surprizing Entertainments, too tedious
here to mention. Perform'd by the greatest Masters now in
Europe. The like never seen before in England.' </p>
 <p>  Rope-dancing was evidently very popular, for there is
another booth, in which Blondin is outdone.  'It is there you
will see the Italian Scaramouch dancing on the Rope, with
a Wheel Barrow before him with two Children and a Dog in
it, and with a Duck on his Head; who sings to the Company,
and causes much laughter.'  And yet one more, for it introduces
<pb n="252" id="p.252"/>

us to the most famous rope-dancer of the reign- ' Lady
Mary.'   'Her Majesty's Company of Rope Dancers. At
Mr. Barnes and Finly's Booth, between the Hospital Gate
and the Crown Tavern, opposite the Cross Daggers, during
the usual time of Bartholomew Fair, are to be seen the most
famous Rope dancers in Europe. And 1st. 2 young Maidens,
lately arrived from France, Dance with and without a Pole
to admiration. 2. The Famous Mr. Barnes, of whose
performances this Kingdom is so sensible, Dances with 2
Children at his Feet, and with Boots and Spurs. 3. Mrs.
Finly distinguished by the name of Lady Mary for her
incomparable Dancing, has much improv'd herself since the
last Fair.'  Lady Mary is frequently mentioned in
contemporary literature, and on one occasion is alluded to  'as little
dressed as Lady Mary.'  This probably arose from her
dispensing with petticoats in dancing. The German rope-dancer,
immortalised by Lauron, is dressed in a fine frilled Holland
shirt, trunk hose, and tights-in fact, the usual acrobatic dress;
and <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName> notices two dancers,  'who, to show their Affection
to the Breeches wor'em under their Petticoats; which, for
decency's sake, they first Danc'd in; But they doft their
Petticoats after a gentle breathing.'  This probably accounts
for the caustic remark in the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> (No. 51),  'The
Pleasantry of stripping almost Naked has been since
practised (where indeed it should have begun) very successfully
at Bartholomew Fair.' </p>
   <p>There were, also, natural curiosities to be seen.  'At the
next Door to the Sign of the Greyhound in <placeName key="Smithfield">Smithfield</placeName>, is
to be shown (by Her Majesty's Order) a Wonderful and
Miraculous Sight, a Male Child which was born in Garnsey
of the body of Rebecca Secklin, and now sucks at her Breasts,
being but Thirty Weeks old, with a prodigious big Head,
being above a yard about, and hath been shown to several
Persons of Quality.' </p>
   <p> 'By Her Majesties Authority. At the Hart's Horn's Inn
in Pye Corner, during the time of Bartholomew Fair, will be
seen these strange Rarities following, viz. A Little Farey
Woman, lately come from Italy, being but Two Foot Two
Inches high, the shortest that ever was seen in England, and


<pb n="253" id="p.253"/>

no ways Deform'd, as the other two Women are, that are
carried about the Streets in Boxesfrom House to House, for
some years past, this being Thirteen Inches shorter than either
of them; if any Person has a desire to see her at their own
Houses, we are ready to wait upon them any Hour of the
Day.</p>
   <p>'Likewise a little Marmazet from Bengal that dances the
Cheshire Rounds,<note place="foot" n="7">See Appendix</note>
 and Exercises at the Word of Command.
Also a strange Cock from Hamborough, having Three proper
Legs, Two Fundaments, and makes use of them both at one
time. Vivat Reginae'  (sic).</p>
  <p>  'Next Door to the Golden Hart in <placeName key="West Smithfield">West Smithfield</placeName>,
between the Hospital Gate and Pye Corner during the time
of Bartholomew Fair, is to be seen the Admirable Work of
Nature, a Woman having three Breasts; and each of them
affording Milk at one time or differently, according as they
are made use of. There is likewise to be seen the Daughter
of the same Woman, which hath breasts of the like Nature,
according to her Age; and there never hath been any
extant of such sort, which is wonderful to all that ever did, or
shall behold her.' </p>
   <p> Theatrical performances naturally took a prominent part;
for the two theatres shut up during Fair time, and Mills,
Doggett, and Penkethman, all fair actors, and belonging to
the regular stage, had booths here, and did well; in fact,
Penkethman became wealthy. As <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName>
remarks <note place="foot" n="8"><hi rend="italics">London Spy</hi>.</note>:  'After
struggling with a Long See-Saw, between Pride and Profit;
and having Prudently consider'd the weighty difference
between the Honourable Title of one of His Majesties
Servants, and that of a Bartholomew Fair Player, a Vagabond
by the Statue, did at last, with much difficulty, conclude,
That it was equally Reputable to Play the Fool in the Fair
for Fifteen or Twenty Shillings a Day, as 'twas to please
Fools in the Play House at so much a week.' </p>
  <p>  At Parker's Booth was played the Famous History of
 Dorastus and Fawnia,  'With very pleasant Dialogues and
 Antick Dances.' </p>
   <p> 'Never Acted before. At Miller's Booth, over against

<pb n="254" id="p.254"/>

the Cross Daggers, near the Crown Tavern, during the time
of Bartholomew Fair will be presented an Excellent new
Droll call'd

         <quote rend="blockquote">'The Tempest, or the Distressed Lovers,</quote>

Comical Humours of the Inchanted Scotchman, or Jockey

England was cast away upon the Indian Shore, and in his
Travels found the Princess of the Country, with whom he
fell in Love, and after many Dangers and Perils, was married
to her; and his faithful Scotchman, who was saved with him,
travelling thorow Woods, fell in among Witches, where
between 'em is abundance of Comical Diversion. There in the
Tempest, is Neptune with his Tritons in his Chariot drawn
with Sea Horses and Mairmaids singing. With Variety of
Entertainments, Performed by the best Masters; the
Particulars would be too tedious to be inserted here. Vivat
Regina.' </p>

   <p>There seems to have been another version of this play,
which, after all, was only a travesty of Shakespeare's
 'Tempest.' </p>
   <p> 'At Doggett's Booth, Hosier Lane End, during the Time
of Bartholomew Fair, will be presented a New Droll, called
the Distress'd Virgin, or Unnatural Parents, Being a True
History of the Fair Maid of the West; or The Loving

   <p>Here we see a departure from the old drolls, and a
reliance on the part of the management on mechanical and
spectacular effects: besides which, there was the puppet
show, pure and simple.    'By Her Majesties Permission.

   <p>Occasionally there were rather more refined exhibitions,
but they were very rare. Here is one,  'In the first Booth on

    <p>Bartholomew Fair began on August 24 of each year,
being St. Bartholomew's Day, and lasted fourteen days. In
<date value="1691">1691</date> and <date value="1694">1694</date> it was reduced to the old term of-three days,
and in <date value="1697">1697</date>, <date value="1700">1700</date>, and <date value="1702">1702</date> stage plays were prohibited in
the fair. The revenue derived from it formed part of the
income of the Lord Mayor, and in <date value="1697">1697</date> a proposal was
made to allow the Lord Mayor 4,000&amp;pound;. a year for the
maintenance of his office, and abolish his perquisites; when
Bartholomew Fair was valued at 100&amp;pound;. per annum.</p>
   <p>On June 2, <date value="1708">1708</date>,  'the Common Council of this City
Mett, and the lease for holding Bartholomew Fair expiring
the 11th of August, agreed, That for the future none should
be kept for Stage Plays, raffling Shops &amp;c. which tend to
debauchery; but only 3 dayes for the sale of leather and
Cattle, according to its antient custome.'  <note place="foot" n="11"><persName key="Luttrell,Narcissus">Luttrell</persName>.</note>
 The raffling shops were clearly illegal, for the same writer says, October 11,
<date value="1705">1705</date>:  'Yesterday the grand jury found bills of indictment
against all those persons who kept raffling shops in the
Cloysters during Bartholomew fair.'  But all the legislation
in the world was impotent to put down this fair, until, in this
century, public opinion as to the expedience of fairs was
changed, and  'Bartlemy'  fair was proclaimed for the last
time in <date value="1855">1855</date>.</p>
   <p>May Fair, or, as it was originally called, <placeName key="St. James's Fair">St. James's Fair</placeName>,
was of old date, as Machyn mentions it in his  'Diary for
<date value="1560">1560</date>.'  <persName key="Pepys,Samuel">Pepys</persName>, also, calls it by the latter name when he
speaks of it: its name of May fair was comparatively recent,
and was, of course, owing to its being held in that month.
It was held on the north side of Piccadilly, and seems to



<pb n="261" id="p.261"/>

have had even a more evil repute than Bartholomew Fair.
The Observator says:  'Can any rational men imagine that
her Majesty would permit so much lewdness as is committed
in May Fair, for so many days together, so near to
her royal Palace, if she knew anything about the matter ?'
Anyhow the fair flourished during the major portion of Anne's
reign.</p>
   <p>The shows were very much like those at the larger fair.
Here is one in <date value="1702">1702</date>:  'At MILLER'S Booth in May Fair, the
Second Booth on the Right Hand coming into the Fair, over
against the Famous Mr. Barnes the Rope Dancer, will be

   <p> 'Lady Mary'  was at the same fair, and advertises herself
by means of a disclaimer:  ' Whereas it hath been maliciously
reported that Mrs. Finley, who for her incomparable Dancing
on the Rope, is unwillingly distinguish'd by the Name of the
Lady Mary, was Dead; This is to inform all Persons, That
the said Report is Notoriously false, she now being in Mr.
Barnes's and Finley's Booth, over against Mr. <persName key="Pinkethman,William">Pinkethman</persName>
and Mr. Simson's, next to Mr. Mills, and Mr. Bullock's in
May Fair,' &amp;c. And she was there again in <date value="1704">1704</date>: 'At Mr.
Finley and Mr. Barnes's Booth, During the time of May Fair,
will be seen a Compleat Company of near 20 of the best
Rope Dancers, Vaulters and Tumblers in Europe, who are all
excellent in their several Performances, and do such
wonderful and surprizing things, as the whole World cannot
parallel; where Finley, who gave that extraordinary
satisfaction before Charles III. King of Spain on Board the Royal
Katherine, performs several new entertainments, and where
the Lady Mary, likewise shows such additions to her former
admirable perfections, as renders her the wonder of the
whole world.'  She was very popular, as <persName key="Pinkethman,William">Pinkethman</persName>
somewhat bitterly remarks in the  'Epilogue to the Bath'  (acted
<pb n="262" id="p.262"/>

at <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName>, <date value="1701">1701</date>), where he says he made grimaces to
empty benches, while Lady Mary had carried all before her:-
              Gadzooks, what signified my Face ?
</p>
   <p>This, however, did not prevent <persName key="Pinkethman,William">Pinkethman</persName> from going
there again; for in <date value="1704">1704</date> he issued the following
advertisement:  'In Brookfield Marketplace at the East corner of
Hide Park, is a Fair to be kept for the space of Sixteen days,
beginning the First of May: The first three days for Live
Cattle and Leather, with the same Entertainment as at
Bartholomew Fair, where there are shops to be Lett ready built,
for all manner of Tradesmen that usually keep Fairs; and
so to continue yearly at the same Time and place; being a
Free Fair; and no person to be arrested or molested during
the Time of this Fair by Virtue of Pye Powder Court. And
at <persName key="Pinkethman,William">Mr. Pinkeman</persName>'s Droll Booth will be performed several
Entertainments which will be expressed at large upon the
Bills, especially one very surprizing that the whole World
never yet produced the like, viz, He speaks an Epilogue upon
an Elephant between Nine and Ten Foot high, arriv'd from
Guinea, led upon the Stage by Six Blacks. The Booth is
easily known by the Picture of the Elephant and Mr.
<persName key="Pinkethman,William">Pinkethman</persName> sitting in State on his back, on the outside of
his Booth. Any body that wants Ground for Shops or
Booths, may hire it of <persName key="Pinkethman,William">Mr. Pinkeman</persName>, enquire at the Bull
Head in Brookfield Market, alias May Fair.' </p>
   <p>He was there again in <date value="1707">1707</date>.  'At <persName key="Pinkethman,William">Pinkeman</persName>'s Booth in
May Fair, to entertain the Quality, Gentry, and others, he
has got Eight Dancing Doggs, brought from Holland, which
are Admir'd by all that see them: and they will dance upon
<persName key="Pinkethman,William">Mr. Pinkeman</persName>'s Stage in each Show. This Extraordinary
Charge he's at (in procuring these Doggs) is purely to divert
the Town. They are the Wonder of the World, The last
Show beginning between 8 &amp; 9 a Clock for the Entertainment
of the Quality, as the Park breaks up.' </p>
   <p>There was another theatrical company:  'At the NEW
PLAY HOUSE in MAY FAIR, During the time of the FAIR
will be Play'd, the True and Ancient Story of MAUDLIN the
Merchants Daughter of BRISTOL and her lover ANTONIO.



<pb n="263" id="p.263"/>

How they were Cast away in a Tempest upon the Coast of
Barbary; where the Mermaids were seen floating on the
Seas, and Singing on the Rocks, foretelling their danger. The
DROLL intermingled with most delightful merry Comedy,
after the manner of an OPERA, with extraordinary variety of
Singing and Dancing: By his Grace the Duke of
Southampton's Servants. The Place will be Known by the Balcone
adorn'd with Blue Pillars twisted with Flowers. Vivat Regina.' </p>
   <p>May Fair boasted of its natural curiosities, as the two
following advertisements testify:  'Near Hide Park Corner
during the Time of May Fair, near the Sheep pens over
against Mr. Penkethman's Booth; Is to be seen the Wonder
of the World in Nature, being a Mail Child born with a Bear
growing on its Back alive, to the great Admiration of all
spectators, having been shown before most of the Nobility
of the Land.' </p>
   <p> 'By Her Majesties Permission. This is to give Notice to
all Gentlemen, Ladies and others, that coming into May Fair,
the first Booth on the left Hand, over against Mr.
Pinkemans Booth; During the usual time of the Fair, is to be
seen, a great Collection of Strange and Wonderful Rarities,
all Alive from several parts of the World.</p>
   <p>'A little Black Man lately brought from the West Indies,
being the Wonder of this Age, he being but 3 Foot high and
25 Years Old.</p>
   <p>'Likewise 2 Wood Monsters from the East Indies, Male

   <p>'Also a little Marmoset from the East Indies, which by
a great deal of Pains is now brought to that perfection, that
no Creature of his Kind ever perform'd the like; he Exercises
by Word of Command, he dances the Cheshire Rounds, he
also dances with 2 Naked Swords, and performs several other
Pretty Fancies. Likewise a Noble Civet Cat from Guiny
which is admir'd for his Beauty, and that incomparable Scent,
which Perfumes the whole Place. Also a Muntosh from
Rushy, being very Wonderfully Marked.</p>
<pb n="264" id="p.264"/>

   <p>'Also a Helliscope from Argier, being the Beautifuls
Creature in all the World; specked like a Leopard. Vivat

   <p>The  '<hi rend="italics">London Spy</hi>'  would be incomplete without an
account of a scene so congenial as May Fair, so of course he
visited it; but it does not appear to have vied in any degree
with Bartholomew Fair.  'We order'd the Coach to drive
thro' the Body of the Fair that we might have the better
View of the Tinsey Heroes and the gazing Multitude;
expecting to have seen several Corporations of Stroling
Vagabonds, but there prov'd but one Company, amongst whom
Merry Andrew was very busie in coaxing the attentive Crowd
into a good Opinion of his Fraternitie's and his own
Performances; and when with abundance of Labour, Sweat,
and Nonsense he had drawn a great cluster of the Mob on
his Parade, and was just beginning to encourage them to
Walk in and take their Places his unlucky opposite, whose
boarded Theatre entertain'd the Publick with the wonderful
activity of some little Indian Rope Dancers, brings out a
couple of Chattering Homunculusses, drest up in Scaramouch
Habit; and every thing that Merry Andrew and his Second
did on the one side, was mimick'd by the little Flat nos'd
Comedians on the other, till the two Diminutive Buffoons,
by their Comical Gestures had so prevail'd upon the gaping
Throng, that tho' Merry Andrew had taken pains, with all
the wit he had to collect the Stragling Rabble into their
proper order, yet like an unmannerly Audience, they turn'd
their Backs upon the Players, and devoted themselves wholly
to the Monkeys, to the great vexation of Tom Fool and all
the Strutting train of imaginary Lords and Ladies. At last
comes an Epitome of a Careful Nurse, drest up in a Country
Jacket, and under her Arm a Kitten for a Nurslin, and in her
contrary hand a piece of Cheese; down sits the little Matron
with a very Motherly Countenance, and when her Youngster
Mew'd, she Dandled him, and Rock'd him in her Arms, with
as great signs of Affections as a loving Mother could well
shew to a disorder'd Infant; then bites a piece of the Cheese,
and after she had mumbled it about in her own Mouth,
then thrust it with her Tongue into the Kitten's. Just



<pb n="265" id="p.265"/>

as I have seen some Nasty Old Sluts feed their
Grandchildren.' </p>
   <p>The other shows in the fair seem to have been very poor:
two or three dancing booths, a puppet show,  'a Turkey Ram,
with as much Wooll upon his Tail as would load a
Wheelbarrow,'  and a couple of tigers, were all <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName> could find
worth recording.</p>
   <p>The fair was disorderly, and in <date value="1702">1702</date> an incident occurred
which materially assisted its downfall.  '<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, May 16.
The Constables of this Liberty being more than ordinary
vigilant in the discharge of their duty, since the coming forth
of her Majesty's pious Proclamation again Vice and
Debauchery, and having in pursuance thereof taken up several
Lewd Women in May Fair, in order to bring them to Justice,
were opposed therein by several rude Soldiers, one of whom
is committed to Prison, and the rest are diligently enquired
after.'  <note place="foot" n="12"><hi rend="italics">Postman</hi>, May 14/16, <date value="1702">1702</date>.
</note> In fact, among them they managed to kill a constable,
named John Cooper-for which murder a fencing-master
named Cook was afterwards hanged at Tyburn; and, although
the fair lingered a few years longer, yet it became such a
nuisance that in November <date value="1708">1708</date> the Grand Jury of
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>  'did present as a publick Nuisance and
Inconvenience, the yearly riotous and tumultuous Assembly in a

Fields, in this County, called May Fair.'  <note place="foot" n="13">Stow's Survey, ed. <date value="1720">1720</date>.</note></p>
   <p>This was the beginning of its end, and <date value="1708">1708</date> saw the last
of the fair.  'Saturday 30 April <date value="1709">1709</date>. Yesterday was
published a proclamation by her Majestie, prohibiting the erecting
or making use of any booths or stalls in Mayfair, for any
plays, shows, gaming, musick meetings, or other disorderly
assemblies.'  <note place="foot" n="14"><persName key="Luttrell,Narcissus">Luttrell</persName>.</note>
 That this had been expected is shown by <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName>,
writing on April 18, <date value="1709">1709</date>.  ' Advices from the upper end of
Piccadilly say, that May Fair is utterly abolished.'  <note place="foot" n="15"><hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, No. 4.</note></p>
   <p>The <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi> (No. 21) makes merry over its downfall, and
says,  'if any lady or gentleman have occasion for a tame
elephant, let them enquire of Mr. <persName key="Pinkethman,William">Pinkethman</persName>, who has one to
dispose of at a reasonable rate. The downfall of May-fair


<pb n="266" id="p.266"/>

 has quite sunk the price of this noble creature, as well as of
 many other Curiosities of Nature.  A tiger will sell almost as cheap as
 an ox; and I am Credibly informed, a man may purchase a cat with three legs,
 for very near the value of one with four. I hear likewise that there is a a great desolation
 among the gentlemen and ladies who were the ornaments of
 the town, and used to shine in plumes and diadems; the
 heroes being most of them pressed, and the queens beating
 hemp.' </p>
 	<p>There was also a fair at Southwark, but of this very little
 mention is made in the newspapers or handbills.  It was an
 old one, dating from <date value="1492">1492</date>, and was founded by a Charter
 granted by Edward IV., to hold a fair  'for three days, that is
 to say, the 7th, 8th, 9th days of September to be holden,
 together with a Court of Pie Powders, and with all the
 liberties to such Fairs appertaining.'   It used to be opened
 with some degree of state by the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs,
 and was generally called  'Our Lady's Fair.' </p>
 	<p>The indefatigable public caterer, <persName key="Pinkethman,William">Pinkethman</persName>, was there,
 in <date value="1704">1704</date>, with  'the same Company that was at Bartholomew
 Fair over against the Hospital Gate, particularly the two
 famous French Maidens, and the Indian Woman; and also
 Italian interludes of Scaramouch and Harlequin, by those
 two Great Masters of their kind Mr. Sorine and Mr. Baxter;
 and likewise extraordinary Performances on the Manag'd
 Horse by the famous Mr. Evans and Mr. Baxter, who both
 perform several new things in their Way.  And also Mr.
 Evans walds on the Slack Rope, and throws himself a
 Somerset through a Hogshead hanging eight Foot high, with
 several other Entertainments too tedious to insert here.' </p>
 	<p>In <date value="1705">1705</date>  'the two famous French Maidens the Lady
 Isabella and her Sister,'  again attended the fair, accompanied
 by  'the Famous Mr. Luly, who walks on the Slack Rope
 without a Pole, and stands upon one Legg distinctly playing
 a tune on the violin; and likewise turns himself round on the
 Rope with as much freedom as if on the Ground.' </p>
 	<p>An old friend was also there,  'The Whole Story of the
 Creation of the World, or Paradise lost,'  but seemingly its
 sole attraction was not sufficient, for it was accompanied by


<pb n="267" id="p.267"/>

 ' The Ball of Little Dogs come from Lovain, which performs,
by their cunning tricks, Wonders in the World by Dancing.
You shall see one of them named Marquis of Gaillardin,
whose Dexterity is not to be compared; he dances with
Mrs. Poncette his Mistress, and the rest of their Company at
the sound of Instruments; observes so well the Cadance,
that they amaze every Body. They have danced in most of
the Courts of Europe, especially before the Queen and most
of the Quality of England. They are carried to Persons of
Qualities Houses if required. They stay but a little while in
this Place. They give a General Satisfaction to all People
that see them.' </p>
   <p>Here also was to be seen the English Sampson, William
Joyce, described by <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName> as  'the Southwark Sampson, who
breaks Carmens Ribs with a Hug, snaps Cables like Twine
Thread, and throws Dray Horses upon their backs, with as
much Ease as a Westphalia Hog can crack a Cocoa Nut.'
When he exhibited before William III., he lifted 1 ton and
14  1/2 lbs. of lead, tied a very strong rope round him to which
was attached a strong horse, which, although whipped, failed
to move him: this rope he afterwards snapped like pack thread.
 'We are credibly inform'd that the said Mr. Joyce pull'd up
a Tree of near a Yard and a half Circumference by the Roots
at Hamstead on Tuesday last in the open View of some

<p>BUT it must not be imagined that these fairs monopolised all
the rarities and natural curiosities. On the contrary, there
were plenty on exhibition elsewhere, as we shall see.  'This is
to give Notice to all Gentlemen, Ladies, and Others, that the
Great Ox that hath been so long talk'd of, and that hath
been in the News so often, is now come to London, and is to
be seen any Hour of the Day, at the White Horse Inn in
<placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, at the same place where the great Elephant was
seen. This Large and Famous Beast, otherwise called the
True Lincolnshier Ox, is Nineteen Hands High, and Four
Yards Long, from his Face to his Rump, and never was
Calv'd nor never Suckt, and two Years ago was no bigger
than another Ox, but since is grown to this Prodigious
Bigness. This Noble Beast was lately shown at the University
of Cambridge, with great Satisfaction to all that saw him.
The like Beast for Bigness was never seen in the World
before. Vivat Reginae'  (sic). Other dimensions are given
when it was exhibited at May Fair.  ' His shin being 36 inches
round, and an Ell broad from Huckle Bone to Huckle Bone
across the Back.'  The following looks suspiciously like a
newspaper puff:  'Yesterday the 17th Instant, was proffer'd
for the Great Lincolnshire Ox, 350 Guineas.' <note place="foot" n="1">

   <p>Then there was a  'Large Buckinghamshire Hog, above
10 Foot long; 13 Hands high; above 7 foot and a half
round the Body; almost 5 Foot round the Neck, and 18 inches
round the fore Leg, above the Joynt.'  And  'At the White
Horse in <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>'  could be seen the  'Wonderful
Worcestershire Mare 19 Hands high, curiously shaped, every way
proportionable.' </p>
   <p>These were native productions, and, although abnormal,
could not compete with rarities from foreign lands-especially
with the whale, <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="LA">vide </foreign></hi><hi rend="italics">Daily Courant</hi>, September 15, <date value="1712">1712</date>:

the same will for the curiosity of Gentlemen, &amp;c., be exposed

read in the <hi rend="italics">Daily Courant</hi> of September 22, that  'the Royal
Whale, supposed to be the Spermacete so much admired,
will be exposed to Sale by Auction to-morrow at 4 o'clock.'
Its purchaser is unknown, but we hear of it again:  'We
called at the Isle of Dogs to see the Skeleton of a whale,
forty-eight yards long, and thirty-five round.' <note place="foot" n="2">Diary of <persName key="Thoresby,Ralph">Ralph Thoresby</persName>, July 14; <date value="1714">1714</date>.</note></p>
   <p>Of course there was no Zoological Society at that time,
and the only way of seeing foreign animals was by small
private collections, which, for want of capital, never contained
any very rare specimens. Still, it was something even to get
this, and we must not forget that our own Zoological
collection is the work of the present century, and is an example
followed by scarcely any other town in England, where still,
as in the villages, people are dependent upon the travelling
menageries for any practical knowledge they may possess of
the natural history of any land other than their own. In
London a permanent collection of wild beasts, or at all events
lions and tigers, had existed at the Tower, where once was a
white bear, which used, duly fastened by a cord, to fish in the
<placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName>; and we have seen that these animals were one of
the principal sights of the city.</p>
   <p> 'At the White Horse Inn in <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, any time of the
Day or Evening,'  were to be seen  '1. A little Black Hairy

Male and Female, the Male being the largest that ever was

his common burden is twelve hundredweight, with which he
travels 40 miles a day; there is also to be seen a Civet Cat
giveing a pleasant smell throughout the Room. Likewise a
Wolf and other wild beasts are there to be seen at any time
of the day (all being alive).' </p>
   <p>A dromedary seems to have been considered a great
curiosity, and the following advertisement gives a wonderful
description of it.  'By Her Majesties Authority. Betwixt

all Gentlemen, Ladies, and Others, that JUST over against
the Mews Gate at Charing Cross, is to be seen a Collection
of strange and wonderful Creatures from most Parts of the
World, all alive.</p>
   <p>'The First being a little Black Man, being but 3 Foot
high, and 32 Years of Age, strait and proportionable every
way, who is distinguished by the Name of the Black Prince,
and has been shown before most Kings and Princes in
Christendom. The next being his Wife, the Little Woman,
NOT 3 Foot high, and 30 Years of Age, strait and
proportionable as any Woman in the Land, which is commonly call'd
the Fairy Queen, she gives a General satisfaction to all that
sees her, by Diverting them with Dancing, being big with
Child. Likewise their little Turkey Horse, being but 2 Foot
odd Inches High, and above 12 Years of Age, that shews
several diverting and surprising Actions, at the Word of
Command.   The least Man, Woman and Horse that ever
was seen in the World Alive. The Horse being kept in a Box.
The next being a strange Monstrous Female Creature, that
was taken in the Wood in the Desarts of AETIOPIA in Prestor
John's Country, in the remotest parts of AFFRICA, being
brought over from Cape de Bon Esperance alias Cape of Good
Hope; from hir Head downwards she resembles Humane
Nature, having Breasts, Belly, Navel, Nipples, Legs, and Arms
like a Woman, with a long Monstrous Head, no such Creature
was ever seen in this part of the World before, she showing
many strange and wonderful Actions which gives great
satisfaction to all that ever did see her. The next is the Noble
Picary which is very much admir'd by the Learned. The next
being the Noble Jack-call, the Lion's provider, which hunts
in the Forest for the Lion's Prey. Likewise a small Egyptian
Panther, spotted like a Leopard. The next being a strange
monstrous Creature, brought from the Coast of Brazil, having
a Head like a Child, Legs and Arms very wonderful, with a
long Tail like a Serpent, wherewith he feeds himself, as an
Elephant doth with his Trunk. With several other Rarities
too tedious to mention in this Bill.' </p>

           'The finest Taught Horse in the World.
These are to give Notice to all Gentlemen, Ladies, and
Others, that are Lovers of Sport and Ingenuity, that at the
Ship on Great Tower Hill will be shewn a Dancing Horse,
which performs a great many Dexterous Actions at the Word
of Command, Viz., He fetches and carries like a Spaniel
Dog, if you hide a Glove Handkerchief, Door Key, Pewter
Bason, or so small a thing as a Silver Two Pence, he will seek
about the Room till he finds it and brings it to his Master.
   'Turn him loose in the Room without either Bridle or
Halter on his Head, altho' there were a hundred People in
the Room, some paying as they come in, and some not
paying, yet let them sit and be mixed one amongst another,
he will find them out that have not payd from the rest.
   'Borrowing several pieces of Money of Persons in the
Room, Blind fold this Horse whilst the Money is in
Borrowing, yet giving him the Money, he will take it in his Mouth one
piece after another and will give it where 'twas Borrowed,
and will give account what Pieces they are when he delivers
them. He tells all Numbers and findeth any one Person from
another; he plays at Cards, at Putt, a thing much to be
admired, he plays with as much readiness as any one that
plays with him. Tell him that there is an Express Warrant
come to press him, and that he must leave his Master to go
and serve the French King, unless he can find some way to
deceive the Press Masters, he presently falleth so Lame, that
he can hardly set one Foot before another, but telling him if
he is Alive he must go, he throweth himself on the Ground,
and with his Legs stretched out stiff, and his Tongue lying
out of his Mouth, as if he were Dead; but telling him that
he must rise and Serve Queen Anne, he riseth up and is
Extraordinary Brisk and Cheerful; he turns his Body round
on one Foot, and will Leap through Hoops, and performs
Sixty Actions at Command without Bridle on his Head; the

   <p>Dwarfs always have been shown about, and the following
advertisement is probably that of one of the rivals to that
spiteful <soCalled>'little Farey Woman'</soCalled> already noticed.

   <p> 'At the Brandy Shop over against the Eagel and Child

Look'd as Old then as He does now. His Head being a
great piece of Curiosity, having no Scull, with several
Imperfections worthy your Observation.' </p>
   <p>  ' There were giants in the earth in those days,'  and at the
 'Hercules's Pillars at Charing Cross'  might be seen a German
giant, seven and a half feet high, and an Italian giantess
 'above Seven foot high, and every way proportionable
weighing 425 Pounds Weight.'  This seems to have been
the normal height of giants, for the Saxon giant
<note place="foot" n="4"> 'This is to satisfie all People that have been inform'd that the High German

shown to the Queen and Prince George at Windsor; but,
previously,  'he had the Honour to be presented with a piece
of Armour proportionable to his Bigness, by the King of the
Romans.' </p>

   <p> Germany, however, was not to have the monopoly of
supplying us with giants-that, our patriotism could not
standso a real live British giant was produced, warranted genuine.
The only fault about him is that he does not state his height,
so that we have no means of comparing him with the foreign
importations.</p>
   <p>  'This is to give Notice to all Gentlemen, Ladys and

taken in a Skirmish near South Carolina, between the Natives

  <p> Divers freaks of humanity were shown, but it requires
<figure id="fig.43" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00043"><head>HUNGARIAN YOUTH.</head></figure>
some credulity to take in the following:  'At the Herculus
Pillars at Charring Cross, is to be seen a Girl that was found
on a Mountain, in the west of England; When an Eminent
Gentlewoman observing her to be without Fingers or Toes;
and without Speech, in regard to her Distress, ordered her to
be brought to her Habitation; this Gentlewoman for many
Years, was troubled with Convulsions of a severe kind, was
perfectly Cured in a very short time, by the Girls Stroaking.
This Girl hath like Success in Pains that arise from the
Spleen, Sores, and Swellings, and many other Distempers,
<pb n="278" id="p.278"/>

and what is very Remarkable also in her; She never spoke
one Word in Four Years, and then by a Prophetick Spirit,
said, the Gentlewoman that preserved her, would Die by Two
a Clock which happened accordingly. The Girl is Ingenious,
and can Work at her Needle; and perform several other
things worth Observation; Price for seeing her Six Pence a

  <p>  ' This young Man was Born in Hungary, and is about 18
years of Age, a Foot and a Half High: In the places where

speaks several Languages. Vivat Regina.' </p>
   <p>The following, although a curious, could hardly have been
a pleasing, exhibition.  'The Bold Grimace Spaniard. At
the Ram's Head Inn in Fanchurch Street, is to be seen a
Bold Grimace Spaniard, lately brought over, by David
Cornwell, in the Bilboa Merchant: He liv'd 15 Years among wild
Creatures in the Mountains, and is reasonably suppos'd to
have been taken out of his Cradle, an Infant, by some Savage
Beast, and wonderfully preserv'd, 'till some Comedians
accidently pass'd thro' those Parts, and perceiving him to be of
human Race, pursu'd him to his Cave, where they caught
him in a Net. They found something wonderful in his
Nature, and took him with 'em in their Travels thro' Spain
and Italy. He performs the following surprising Grimaces,
viz. He lolls out his Tongue a Foot long, turns his Eyes in
and out at the same time; contracts his Face as small as an
Apple; extends his Mouth six Inches, and turns it into the
Shape of a Bird's Beak, and his Eyes like to an Owl's; turns
his Mouth into the Form of a Hat cock'd up three ways;
and also frames it in the manner of a four square Buckle;
licks his Nose with his Tongue, like a Cow; rolls one Eye
Brow two Inches up, the other two down; changes his face
to such an astonishing Degree, as to appear like a Corpse
long buried; Altho bred wild so long, yet by travelling with


<pb n="279" id="p.279"/>

the aforesaid Comedians 18 years, he can sing wonderfully
fine, and accompanies his Voice with a thorow Bass on the
Lute. His former natural Estrangement from human
Conversation obliged Mr. Cornwell to bring a Jackanapes over
with him for his Companion, in whom he takes great Delight
and Satisfaction.' </p>
   <p>Queen Anne's time could also match our age with  'Two
Headed Nightingales,'   'Siamese Twins,'  or  'Pygopagi.'   'At
Mr. John Pratt's, at the Angel in Cornhil . . . are to be seen
two Girls, who are one of the greatest Wonders in Nature
that ever was seen, being Born with their Backs fasten'd to
each other, and the Passages of their Bodies are both one
way. These Children are very Handsome and Lusty, and
Talk three different Languages; they are going into the
7th year of their Age. Those who see them, may very well
say, they have seen a Miracle, which may pass for the 8th
Wonder of the World.'  These were Helen and Judith, who
were born at Tzoni, in Hungary, October 26, <date value="1701">1701</date>; lived to
the age of twenty-one, and died in a convent at Petersburg
February 23, <date value="1723">1723</date>. They were well shaped, very good
looking, and very fond of each other. They spoke Hungarian,
high and low Dutch, French, and English.</p>
   <p>There was also exhibited  'A young fresh country Lad
just arriv'd from Suffolk; who is covered all over his Body,
except the Face, Palms of the Hands, and Soles of his Feet,
with Bristles like a Hedgehog, as hard as Horn, which shoots
off yearly.' </p>
   <p> 'There is lately arrived a Person that was born without
either Arms or Hands, and he does such miraculous things
with his Feet, that the like never was known in the World.
.... He writes very fine with his Mouth, right and left Foot
without discerning, which is the best, and in five sorts of
Languages, and makes his own Pens with a Pen Knive; he
walks upon his two great Toes, and stands upon one Toe;
he lays his Foot in his Neck, and hops upon the other, he
stands upon the top of a little Stool, and reaches a Glass
with his Mouth from under it; he threads a very fine and
small Needle, and sows very prettily; and all Actions
whatsoever is done by Hands, he does with his Feet: he Combs
<pb n="280" id="p.280"/>

or dresses a Perriwig very well, shaves himself, dresses and
undresses himself &amp;c., and all with his feet, &amp;c.' </p>
  <p> There were conjurors, especially  'the incomparable
German. ... He makes pass through his Cups 60 Balls,
without touching them, and they are turn'd into little live Birds,
which whistle upon the Table. He takes a parcel of Cards,
and throws them about the Room, and they are turn'd into
little live Birds.'  He was only equalled by  'An admirable
Piece of Ingenuity in Hanging Sword Court, the Middle of
<placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>,'  where twice a day  'several Persons may
                            be Entertained at Table, with

 various Dishes, and different

                            drinking Glasses of the
Entertained; of the which, when
                            they are satisfied, a Serpent
                            arising from a Box on the

                            thereon remaining; and that
                            very moment another Table of
                            the same Dimensions, and
furnished with another service, is
                            in place where the former Table
                            stood, without any visible
                            Cause.' </p>
   <p> Posture masters, as the acrobats were then called, abounded,
 and one of the chief among them was Higgins, successor to
 the famous Clark, who could dislocate and deform himself at
 pleasure. But he must have found a worthy imitator in  'The
 young Posture Master from Exeter, who performs those
Postures of Body, that none never yet did; he extends his Body
 into all deform'd Shapes of Stature; he makes his Hip and
 Shoulder Bones meet together; he stands upon one Leg and
 extends the other in a direct Line half a Yard above his
 Head; he drinks her Majesty's Health on his Head; he lays
 his Head on the Ground, and turns his Body round twenty
 Times, without stirring his Face from the Place; he sucks all


<pb n="281" id="p.281"/>

his Bowels into his Breast, making a pack Saddle on his Back,
that he will bear the lustiest Man that will be pleas'd to sit
upon his Rump; he will sit in a Posture as if his Body was
split, and so divides his Legs that his Toes are separated
Six Foot ten Inches from Toe to Toe; he stands on a Table
and turns his Head backwards below his Heels; he likewise
dances any Dance upon his Knees with his Toes in his Hands,
and dances true to the Musick.'  But even all these
accomplishments do not seem to have been sufficiently attractive of
themselves, for with him was  'a Child of five Years of Age,
who does the Activity of Tumbling to the greatest
Perfection. After which, Mr. Cornwall takes an empty Bag,
and turns it twenty times, and stamps on it, if requir'd, and
then commands several Eggs out of it, and at last the live
Hen.' </p>
  <p> Children then, as now, had to go through acrobatic
performances. There was  'a Boy that walks upon a Slack Rope
no thicker than a Penny Cord, and a little Girl that vaults on
the high Rope;'  but, even in our time, we should hardly like
to see  ' a little Child about two Years and a half old, perform
such wonderful things on the Stiff Rope, as is surprising to
all that behold him.'  We hear more of this poor little thing.
 'Whereas it has been industriously and falsly reported that
the little Child that is under 3 years old, that danced on the
Rope and tumbled, is dead; Mr. Francis thought it proper
to certify all People, that the Child is living and well; and
he challenges all Europe to produce a Child of his Age to
perform what he does, both for Dancing and Tumbling.
Likewise the little Girl about 7 Years old, that danced the Rope,
vaulted the Slack Rope, and tumbled to the Admiration of
all who saw her.' </p>
   <p>There was a curious entertainment that lasted nearly the
whole of Anne's reign; of which the first notice I can find is
in the <hi rend="italics">Daily Courant</hi>, November 27, <date value="1704">1704</date>. By degrees Clench
enlarged his repertoire until he did all described in the
accompanying handbill.  'These are to give Notice to all
Gentlemen, Ladies and Others, that Mr. Clench of Barnet who

company of us were this day to see, or rather to hear, an artful
person do several feats of activity with his throat and

of bells, which he imitated in a most miraculous manner;
after that, he gave us all the different notes of a pack of

  <p> Waxwork figures have always been a popular exhibition,
and then was living a Mrs. <persName key="Salmon">Salmon</persName>, whose fame was as great
as Madame Tussaud's.  Her handbills were curiosities in
their way, but they are so long that one only can be

   <p>One of the most popular exhibitions was the puppet
shows kept by Robert Powell, a
dwarfish deformity.  'This is Mr. Powell-
That's he-the little Crooked
Gentleman, that holds a Staff in his Hand,<figure id="fig.46" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.020.DO01.00046"><head>PORTAIT OF POWELL.</head></figure>

Church grumble at his entertainment,
because it took people away from him.
<persName key="Defoe,Daniel">Defoe</persName> says :  ' Mr. Powell by
Subscriptions and full Houses, has gathered
such Wealth as is ten times sufficient
to buy all the Poets in England; that
he seldom goes out without his Chair,
and thrives on this incredible Folly
to that degree, that, were he a Freeman, he might hope
that some future Puppet Show might celebrate his being
Lord Mayor, as he has done Sir R. Whittington.'  <note place="foot" n="14">Groans of Great Britain.</note>
Both in the <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> he is frequently referred to,
especially in the former. In the season he took himself and his
puppets to Bath, so that he always kept them employed.</p>
   <p>His performances were very varied, one being  'The
History of King Bladud, Founder of the Bath. The Figures
being drest after the manner of the Ancient Britains. With
the Walks, Groves, and Representation of the King's Bath



<pb n="286" id="p.286"/>

and new Pump house. The Figures of Ladies and
Gentlemen all moving in real Water.'  He caught the passing folly
as it flew, and depicted it as in  'The City Rake or Punch
turn'd Quaker,'   'Poor Robins Dream or the Vices of the Age
Exposed;'  or, he had a puppet  'of a Rope Dancer, being an
exact Pattern of the present Lady Isabella.'  He was for ever
bringing out some novelty, even if it was such rubbish as  'a
New Piece of Machinary after the British Manner, contrived
and just finished by Powell, which represents a Paradice
wonderful surprising. At the breaking of the clouds arise
several Triumphal Arches, which form several most agreeable
Prospects; beautify'd by her most Serene Majesty of Great
Britain in her Royal Robes, attended by her Peers and
Officers of State; under their Feet are represented the
Trophies taken from the French and Bavarians by her
Majesty's Arms this War.' </p>
   <p>One of the last of Powell's advertisements, in Queen Anne's
reign, was:  'Whereas it has been reported that Punch of the
Bath and <placeName key="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</placeName> was dead, these are to inform the
Publick that he was only in a small consumption, but by the
long experienc'd Cordial of the Golden Elixir is recovered,
and remov'd for the Air to the Great Masquerading House in
Spring Garden, where he hopes once more to see his noble
Benefactors.' </p>
   <p><persName key="Pinkethman,William">Pinkethman</persName> was far too keen to let Powell have the
monopoly of this sort of entertainment, so we find a
handbill:  'This is to give Notice, that <persName key="Pinkethman,William">Mr. PENKETHMAN</persName>, who,
by his Indefatigable Industry, has ever made it his Study

Several Years Application, brought to Perfection, a most
Surprising and Magnificent Machine, call'd the PANTHEON,
consisting of several Curious Pictures, and Moving Figures,
representing the Fabulous History of the HEATHEN GODS.</p>
   <p>'The Whole contains Fourteen several Entertainments,

which have their respective and peculiar Motions, their very

Heads, Legs, and Arms, Hands and Fingers, Artificially
moving exactly to what they perform, and setting one Foot

Manner that Nothing but Nature itself can exceed it. In
short, the PAINTING is by the Finest Hands, and the Story
and Contrivance so Admirable, that it justly deserves to be
esteemed One of the Greatest Wonders of the Age.'  This
show is casually mentioned in <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> (No. 31).</p>
   <p><persName key="Pinkethman,William">Pinkethman</persName> was also proprietor of a moving picture, for
in an advertisements <note place="foot" n="15"><hi rend="italics">Daily Courant</hi>, May 9, <date value="1709">1709</date>.

 saw this picture when in London in <date value="1709">1709</date>, and was
highly delighted with it. He also says:  'I had some
discourse with the German inventor of it, Mr. Jacobus Morian. '
The following is its handbill:-</p>
         <p> ' To All Gentlemen, Ladies and others
Notice is hereby given, that here is arrived from Germany, a
most artificial and Wonderful Original Picture, the like never
seen in all Europe: Part of this fine Picture represents a
Landskip, and the other part the Water on Sea: In the
Landskip you see a Town, out of the Gates of which cometh
a Coach Riding over a Bridge through the Country, behind,
before, and between the Trees till out of sight; coming on the
Bridge, a Gentleman sitting on the Coach, civilly salutes the
Spectating Company, the turning of the Wheels and motion
of the Horses are plainly seen as if natural and Alive. There
Cometh also from the Town Gate a Hunter on Horseback,
with his Doggs behind him, and his Horn at his side, coming
to the Bridge he taketh up his Horn and Blows it that it is
distinctly heard by all the spectators. Another Hunter
painted as if Sleeping, and by the said Blowing of the Horn
awaking, riseth up his Head, looks about, and then lays



<pb n="288" id="p.288"/>

down his Head again to Sleep, to the great Amazement and
Diversion of the Company. There are also Painted and
Represented, Country men and Women, Travellers, Cows and
Pack horses going along the Road till out of sight. And
at a seeming distance on the Hills are several Windmills
continually Turning and Working. From a River or Sea port,
you see several sorts of Ships and Vessels putting to Sea,
which Ships by degrees lessen to the sight as they seem to
Sail further off. Many more Varieties too long to be
inserted here, are Painted and Represented in this Picture to
the greatest Admiration, Diversion and Satisfaction of all
Ingenious Spectators. The Artist Master of this Piece hath
employed above 5 years in contriving, making and
perfecting it. It was design'd for a present to a great Prince
in Germany, to be put in his chiefest Cabinet of greatest
Rarities, but that Prince Dying, the maker kept it to
himself, and now presents it to the View and Diversion of
all ingenious Persons.'  This picture is just noticed in the
<hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi> (No. 129):  'and I doubt not but it will give as good
content as the moving picture in <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>.' </p>
   <p>There was another of these mechanical toys, exhibited at
the same place.  'Far exceeding the Original formerly shewn,
and never publish'd before the beginning of the present Year
171O. Representing several stately ships and vessels sailing
out of the Port of a City; a Coach, drawn by four Horses
going over a bridge into the Town; a Cart with an Old
Woman in it, drawn by two Horses, the Wheels moving: A
Gentleman carry'd in a Chair, saluting the Company, A
Windmill continually turning round; Swans swimming,
which dip their Heads in the Water: A Man digging with
a Pick Ax: All in lively Motion,'  etc. And still one more
appeared in <date value="1713">1713</date>, which was a representation of the sky
effects of morning, moon, and night, with ships sailing, and
saluting the forts as they passed.</p>
   <p>At the Duke of Marlborough's Head, too, was to be seen
 'a true and very natural Representation of the most famous
Antiquities and Stupendious Works commonly called the
Seven Miracles of the World; All which cannot but be
pleasant to the Eyes of all curious Beholders, and perhaps


<pb n="289" id="p.289"/>

more agreeable than may by Words be expressed,'  but there
is no record of what this exhibition was like.</p>
   <p> 'In Bell Yard, over against the <placeName key="Middle Temple Gate">Middle Temple Gate</placeName>,
<placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, next door to the Bell Inn, at the Arms of
Amsterdam, will be shewn for the satisfaction of all persons

the famous City of Amsterdam, being between 20 and 30
foot long, and near 20 foot broad; with all the Churches,
Chappels, Stadt house, Hospitals, noble Buildings, Streets,
Trees, Walks, Avenues, with the Sea, Shipping, Sluices,
Rivers, Canals, &amp;c., most exactly built to admiration; In
short, the Situation and Representation of the whole City is
performed with such Art and Ingenuity, to the wonderful
satisfaction of the States General of the United Provinces,
several Foreign Princes, our Nobility, Gentry, Artificers and
others, that have seen it, that it is allowed to be one of the
greatest curiosities ever yet seen in England. This great
piece of Work was 12 years in finishing, and cost a vast sum
of Money.' </p>
   <p>It is always interesting to watch glass-blowers at work,
and see them turn out their pretty but fragile toys; and
doubtless they yielded as much, or more, delight in Anne's
time.
              'By Her Majesties Authority.
This is to give Notice to all Gentlemen, Ladies, and Others,
That there is lately arriv'd in this Place, a Rare and Curious
ARTIST, which in the presence of all Spectators maketh all
Sorts and Fashions of Indian, China, and all Sorts of Curious
Figures &amp;c. As Jars Teapots, Coffee Dishes, Bottle and Flower
Pots, as small as they please; being very dexteriously
intermixed with red, blew, and other Colours, as Natural as the
Indian painting: As also all sorts of Beasts, Birds, Fowls,
Images, Figures of Men, Women, and Children, which he
bloweth of all Colours in Glass, so curiously, the like was
never seen in this Kingdom.</p>
   <p>'Besides all this, he sheweth you a most wonderful and
admirable Glass of Water, wherein are four or five Images,
which he maketh every one to come up and down as he
pleases, without any help or assistance, being very pleasant

   <p>There was another artist in glass who blew  ' Swans, Ducks,

Bottles and Ladles, with pipes to smoke Tobacco, and
Grenadoes to stick by the Snuff of a candle that gives a report like
a Gun; blows Tea Pots and other fancies imitating China.' </p>
   <p>A singular mechanical toy, too, deserves special
mention:  ' At the Black Horse in Hosier Lane, near
<placeName key="West Smithfield">West Smithfield</placeName> is to be seen a large piece of Water Work, 12

   <p>But the man who did most with hydraulic power was
Winstanley, the builder of the fantastic, semi-Chinese pagoda
lighthouse on the Eddystone rock. Winstanley had been
a mercer in London, and, having made some money, retired
from business, and went to live at Littlebury in <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>. Here

<pb n="292" id="p.292"/>

he constructed ingenious but useless hydraulic toys, and,
from being locally famous, he opened an exhibition of them
in London.</p>
   <p>The first mention I can find of it in this reign, is in the
<hi rend="italics">Postman</hi>, May 1/4, <date value="1703">1703</date>:  'Mr. Henry Winstanley's Water
Works, will be Opened on Thursday being the 6th of May;
And All Persons that please to see them, are desired to be
there between 3 and 4 of the Clock. The House is at the
lower end of Pickadilly, towards Hide Park.'  In the Daily
Courant, August 14, <date value="1703">1703</date>, he notifies that:  'Mr. Henry
Winstanley's Water Works being now open'd, and several
Persons coming too late, by reason of the days being shorter,
this is to satisfie and give notice, that they will be shewn
from Monday next at Four of the Clock. And therefore
all Persons that are disposed to see them, are desired to be
there before the time, or exactly at it. And also this is
further to acquaint, that they will not be shewn this Season
longer than 10 or 14 days, by reason of Mr. Winstanly's
having extraordinary Occasions of going out of Town.' </p>
   <p>It was a disastrous  'out of town'  for him, for he had his
wish gratified in being in his gimcrack lighthouse  'in the
greatest storm ever known,'  namely, that of November 27,
<date value="1703">1703</date>, which clean swept away the building, Winstanley, and
five other persons.</p>
   <p>For some years after his sad death his exhibition was in
abeyance, until we see by the <hi rend="italics">Daily Courant</hi>, June 5, <date value="1707">1707</date>:
 ' The famous Water Works of the late Ingenious Mr. Henry
Winstanley are now open'd, and will continue to be shown
this present June, and the ensuing Month of July (for the
Benefit of his Widow) by his old Servants, with several
Additions. And all Persons that please to see them, are
desir'd to be at the House by 5 of the clock at the farthest,
and they will not lose time in staying. The House is at the
lower End of Picadilly towards Hide Park, and is known by
the Wind Mill on the top of it. As also his famous House
at Littlebury in <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> is kept up, and shewn as formerly,
with several additions.'  His widow continued to show them,
with many variations, every summer during the remainder of
the reign. In <date value="1711">1711</date> there were shown  'Sea Gods and Goddesses,



<pb n="293" id="p.293"/>

Nymphs, Mermaids, and Satirs, all of them playing
of water as suitable, and some Fire mingling with the water,
and Sea Triumphs round the Barrel that plays so many
Liquors; all which is taken away after it had perform'd its
part, and the Barrel is broke in Pieces before the spectators.'
In <date value="1712">1712</date> there is the same entertainment, but fuller details
are given: it was  'of 6 several sorts of Wine, and the best
brandy and biskets, all coming out of the famous Barrel, and
given to the Boxes and Pit; with Geneva, Cherry beer, and
Cyder to the first Gallery, there is also Coffee and Tea as at
all other times.' </p>
   <p>In <date value="1713">1713</date>  'the Curious Barril will be made a Spring
Garden, entertaining the Boxes and Pit with Cool Tankards,
Spaw Waters, Bisquits, Milk, Ale, Beer, Sullibubs, Cake, and
Cheese Cakes, and Flowers playing of Water: And a very
delightful part will be added to the 3 Parts that are usually
performed. There is Galuthetis's Flight from Polyheme, and
as she is carried in State by Neptune attended by many
Figures playing of Water, and some with Fire mingling with
it; then will be a great Tempest of Thunder and Lightning
and burning Flames rolling in great Cascades of Water,
to the Expence of 300 Tun extraordinary.'  In <date value="1714">1714</date>,  'the
Curious Barrel will be made a Dairy House, entertaining the
Boxes and Pit with Curds, several sorts of Creams, Milk,
Whey, Cakes, Cheese Cakes, Sullibubs, New Butter, Butter
Milk, which a Woman will be seen to churn, and a flying
Zepherus, a Flora presenting the spectators with a Basket of
Fruit ... There is Galathea's flight from Polypheme guided
by two flying Boys, with a flaming Torch playing Water
through the Flames: A flying fiery Dragon, out of whose
Mouth comes great Fire Balls, flames of Fire, a large sheet of
Water, with many Cascades of Water, to the expence of 800
Tuns extraordinary.'  It was a very popular exhibition, and
ranked, as we see, <note place="foot" n="17"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 168.</note>
with the opera and the play.</p>
   <p>In <date value="1710">1710</date> the good folks of London were treated to a
somewhat unusual spectacle-that of four real live Indian
chiefs, or kings, as they were called. They came over in April
of that year, and were treated as guests of the nation;

from Spithead on the 8th May, and landed safely at Boston

   <p>The following handbill shows that at some period of their

  <p> That these places of so-called sport were disorderly need
not be said; indeed, to  'make a place a bear-garden'  is
proverbial. The rough element wanted some safe outlet for
its energy, and found it in such exhibitions. Nor must we
be too hasty to decry them when we recollect that it was only
in <date value="1835">1835</date> that it absolutely became illegal to keep any house,
pit, or other place for baiting or fighting any bull, bear, dog,
or other animal. We have our dog-fights now--
prize-fighting is not yet extinct, many a quiet main of cocks is
fought, many a rat-pit exists, and badger-drawing is not
altogether an unknown thing.</p>
<p>   There were three bear-gardens-at Hockley-in-the-Hole
(Clerkenwell), at Marrybone Fields (at the back of Soho
Square), and at Tuttle (Tothill) Fields, <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, and at
all these baiting was carried on. Of the latter we find an
advertisement promising plenty of sport: <note place="foot" n="3"><hi rend="italics">Harl.</hi> MSS. 5931, 282.</note></p>
   <p> ' At William Wells's Bear Garden, in Tuttle Fields, <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, this
present Monday the 10th of April, will be a Green Bull
Baited; and 20 Doggs fights for a Coller, and that Dogg that
runs farthest and fairest wins the Coller; with other
Diversion of Bull Baiting and Bear Baiting.' </p>

<pb n="298" id="p.298"/>

   <p> 'Here follows the Manner of those Bull Baitings which
are so much talk'd of: They tie a Rope to the Root of the
Horns of the Ox or Bull, and fasten the other End of the
Cord to an Iron Ring fix'd to a Stake driven into the
Ground; so that this Cord being about 15 Foot long, the
Bull is confin'd to a Sphere of about 30 Foot Diameter.
Several Butchers, or other Gentlemen, that are desirous to
exercise their Dogs,<note place="foot" n="4">These dogs were only a moderate size.</note>
 stand round about, each holding his
own by the Ears; and when the Sport begins, they let loose
one of the Dogs: The Dog runs at the Bull: the Bull
immovable, looks down upon the Dog with an Eye of Scorn,
and only turns a Horn to him to hinder him from coming
near: The Dog is not daunted at this, he runs round him,
and tries to get beneath his Belly, in order to seize him by
the Muzzle, or the Dewlap, or the pendant Glands: The Bull
then puts himself into a Posture of Defence; he beats the
Ground with his Feet, which he joins together as close as
possible, and his chief Aim is not to gore the Dog with the
Point of his Horn,<note place="foot" n="5">If too sharp, the bull's horns were covered with wooden sheaths.</note>
 but to slide one of them under the Dog's
Belly (who creeps close to the Ground to hinder it) and to
throw him so high in the Air that he may break his Neck in
the Fall. This often happens: When the Dog thinks he is
sure of fixing his Teeth, a Turn of the Horn, which seems to
be done with all the Negligence in the World, gives him a
Sprawl thirty Foot high, and puts him in danger of a damnable
Squelch when he comes down. This Danger would be
unavoidable, if the Dog's Friends were not ready beneath him,
some with their Backs to give him a soft Reception, and
others with long Poles which they offer him slant ways, to
the Intent that, sliding down them, it may break the Force
of his Fall. Notwithstanding all this care, a Toss
generally makes him sing to a very scurvy Tune, and draw his
Phiz into a pitiful Grimace: But, unless he is totally
stunn'd with the Fall, he is sure to crawl again towards the
Bull, with his old Antipathy, come on't what will.
Sometimes a second Frisk into the Air disables him for ever from
playing his old Tricks; But, sometimes, too, he fastens upon



<pb n="299" id="p.299"/>

his Enemy, and when once he has seiz'd him with his Eye
teeth, he sticks to him like a Leech, and would sooner die
than leave his Hold. Then the Bull bellows, and bounds,
and Kicks about to shake off the Dog; by his Leaping the
Dog seems to be no Manner of Weight to him, tho' in all
Appearance he puts him to great Pain. In the End, either
the Dog tears out the Piece he has laid Hold on, and falls, or
else remains fix'd to him, with an Obstinacy that would
never end, if they did not pull him off. To call him away
would be in vain; to give him a hundred blows would be as
much so; you might cut him to Pieces Joint by Joint before
he would let him loose. What is to be done then ? While
some hold the Bull, others thrust Staves into the Dog's
Mouth, and open it by main Force. This is the only Way
to part them.' <note place="foot" n="6"><persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName>.</note></p>
 <p>  This, however, was not always the case. Look at the
other side :-</p>
              <quote rend="blockquote">Curs'd dog, the bull reply'd, no more

popular, for in an advertisement of the <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, Jan. 3/5, <date value="1709">1709</date>
(<date value="1710">1710</date>), we find:  'This Day is published The Bull Baiting, or

  dressed up in Fire works; lately brought over
from the Bear Garden in Southwark, and exposed for the
Diversion of the Citizens of London: at 6d. a piece.'  This
book, however, is very dreary fun.</p>
<p>   But bears and bulls, though baited, were never allowed to
be killed by their adversaries, which, however, was not the
case with cock-fighting, a pastime passionately indulged in
in this reign. There were many cock-pits-one historical one,
the Council Chamber at <placeName key="Whitehall">Whitehall</placeName>, where in <date value="1710">1710</date> Guiscard
stabbed Harley with his penknife, and which went by the
name of the Cockpit certainly till <date value="1810">1810</date>. There was  'The
Royal Cock Pit on the South Side of St. James Park,'  where
mains used to be fought for such prizes as  '4 Guineas a
Battel and 40 the odd Battel.'  And there was a famous one
near Gray's Inn Walks, or Gardens, where dear Sir Roger
walked with the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, and which <persName key="Brown,Thomas">Brown</persName> describes as
 'The Lawyer's Garden of Contemplation, where I found (it
being early in the Morning) none but a parcel of
Superannuated Debauchees, huddled up in Cloaks, Frize Coats and
Wadded Gowns, to preserve their old Carcases from the
searching sharpness of Hampstead Hair.'   There had been
one there previous to <date value="1704">1704</date>, when we find  'At the New Cock
pit at the Bowling Green, behind Grays Inn Walks, this
present Tuesday being the 28th of March, will begin a great
Match of Cock fighting, for Ten Guineas a Battle, and Two
Hundred Guineas the odd Battle, between the Gentlemen of
<placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> and Cambridgeshire, against the Gentlemen of London
and Surry.'  In <date value="1706">1706</date> it was to let, and in <date value="1708">1708</date> it was burnt
down under sad circumstances.  'There had been a great
Match fought on Saturday, and the Weather being hard, two
of the Feeders, Crompton and Day, would stay all Night with
their Cocks; when by Negligence their Candle fell among
the Straw, which took Fire.  In the Morning one Mr.

<pb n="301" id="p.301"/>

Cocks fed, who wonder'd they saw no Snow upon the Cock

before they cou'd make any Body hear, the place was all
on Fire.  One of the feeders was found burnt, only some
part of his Body remaining, and the other is missing.'
<note place="foot" n="10"><hi rend="italics">A Looking-glass for Swearers</hi>, etc., <date value="1708">1708</date>.</note> It
was repaired and re-opened <date value="1709">1709</date>, but was again to be re-let
in <date value="1710">1710</date>. There were many others, even extending to the
suburbs, such as <placeName key="Hampstead">Hampstead</placeName>.</p>
   <p><persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName>'s description of them is amusing, but it would
hardly appear from it that he ever witnessed a fight.  ' Cock
fighting is one of the great English Diversions; they build
Amphitheatres for this Purpose, and Persons of Quality
sometimes appear at them. Great Wagers are laid; but I'm told,
that a Man may be damnably bubbled, if he is not very sharp.' </p>
<p>   County matches used to be arranged; but for a spice of
arrogance little can beat this:  'At the New Cock Pit by the
Bowling Green behind Gray's Inn Walks, next Tuesday, will
begin a great Match of Cock Fighting which will continue all
the Week; the Gentlemen of <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> against all the rest of
Great Britain, for 10 Guineas a Battle and 500 Guineas the
Odd Battle.'  These were the highest stakes ever publicly
advertised in Queen Anne's reign, whatever might have been
done at private matches-as, for instance, in the Tatler's Club
(<hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, 132), Sir Jeoffrey Notch, their chairman, would talk
about his favourite old game-cock Gauntlett,  'upon whose
head, the Knight, in his youth, had won five hundred pounds,
and lost two Thousand.' </p>
  <p> The cocks sometimes fought in silver spurs, but generally
with steel ones, and of these there were several kinds.  'Note
that on Wednesday there will be a single battle fought with
Sickles, after the East India manner. And on Thursday
there will be a Battle Royal, one Cock with a Sickle, and 4
Cocks with fair Spurs. On Friday there will be a pair of
Shake bags fight for 5&amp;pound;. And on Saturday there will be a
Battle Royal, between a Shakebag with fair Spurs, and 4
Matchable Cocks which are to fight with Sickles, Launcet
Spurs, and Penknife Spurs, the like never yet seen. For the
Entertainment of the foreign Ambassadors and Gentlemen.' </p>

<pb n="302" id="p.302"/>

    <p>Cock-fighting even had a literature of its own. In <date value="1709">1709</date>
was published ' The Royal Pastime of Cock fighting &amp;c. by
R. H. a Lover of the Sport' ; and in the same year was printed
another edition of  'The Compleat Gamesters, by C. Cotton,'
in which are full directions as to the breeding, feeding, and
fighting of cocks. As so little is now known of this cruel
sport, a few short extracts from this latter work will make us
more thoroughly comprehend it as it was then practised.</p>
    <p>In shape, the cock must be neither too large nor too
small; with a small head and strong legs; his spurs, though
long and sharp, turning slightly inwards. He should walk
very upright and stately; and if he crows frequently in his
pen it is a sign of courage. The combs or wattles are to be
cut as soon as they appear; and the cock chickens are to be
separated as soon as they begin to peck each other. Fighting
cocks should not begin their career as such until they are
two years old; and before a battle they should be dieted-i.e.
for four days they should be fed with stale bread three times
a day; after which they may have a spar, or sham fight, with
another cock, their spurs being carefully guarded with leather
balls. They must then be stoved, which meant putting them
in deep baskets filled with straw, covering them with straw
and shutting down the lids; but before undergoing this
 ' sudatorium'  they were to be fed with sugar candy, chopped
rosemary, and butter. In the evening the cock was released,
and fed with wheat meal and oatmeal, ale, white of eggs, and
butter.  'The second day after his sparring, take your Cock
into a fair green Close, and having a Dunghill Cock in your
arms, show it him, and then run from him, that thereby you
may entice him to follow, you permitting him to have now
and then a blow; when he begins to pant, being well heated,
take him up and carry him home.'  He was then to have a
dose of pounded leaves of herb of grace, hyssop, and
rosemary, mixed with butter, and then stoved till the evening.
Next day he was to rest, and the day after to be sparred,
which treatment was to be continued for a fortnight; but for
the next month, by which time he was to be fit for fighting,
he was merely to be fed and stoved. He was not to be fed
before fighting.</p>

<p>THE horse, necessarily, in those days, when locomotion was
only obtainable through its agency, was of prime importance:
farriery was fairly understood, and some voluminous
disquisitions on it were published, with most curious receipts
for the various ills horseflesh is heir to, and elaborate
engraving of fleams, firing irons, bits (some of them very cruel),
and all sorts of harness-even down to curry-combs,
dandybrushes, and stable utensils. But it is not here that the
hack or roadster is to be spoken of, but the horse kept for
sport-the race horse-about which they had already found
out the fact, ' Like Race Horses cost more in keeping them
than they're worth.'  <note place="foot" n="1"><hi rend="italics">Tunbridge Walks</hi>.</note>
 The Queen was fond of racing, and
gave her 100&amp;pound;. gold cups to be run for, as now: nay more,
she not only kept race horses, but ran them in her own name.
Her six-year-old grey gelding Pepper ran for her gold cup at
York (over Clifton and Rawcliffe Ings) on July 28, <date value="1712">1712</date>.
Over the same course, and for the same stake, on August 3,
<date value="1714">1714</date>, ran her grey horse Mustard, by the Taffolet Barb,
which, according to the <hi rend="italics">Daily Courant</hi> of May 14, <date value="1714">1714</date>, was
entered to run  'in Whitsun week at Guildford in Surrey for
the 50&amp;pound;. plate' ; and, sad to tell, her brown horse Star
(afterwards called Jacob) ran at York for a plate of the value of


<pb n="304" id="p.304"/>

14&amp;pound;., and won it, on July 30, <date value="1714">1714</date>, the very day on which the
Queen was struck with apoplexy, expiring the next day.</p>
    <p>She paid a visit to <placeName key="Newmarket">Newmarket</placeName> in April <date value="1705">1705</date>, going to
<placeName key="Cambridge">Cambridge</placeName> once or twice during her stay. <persName key="Luttrell,Narcissus">Luttrell</persName> says:
 'Aprill 26, <date value="1705">1705</date>. The queen has ordered her house at
<placeName key="Newmarket">Newmarket</placeName> to be rebuilt, and gave <date value="1000">1000</date>&amp;pound;. towards paving the
town; and bought a running horse of Mr. Holloway, which
cost a <date value="1000">1000</date> guineas, and gave it to the prince.'  Prince
George shared his august consort's love of horse-racing, and
in the Gazette, June 18/21, <date value="1705">1705</date>, we find:  'These are to give
notice, That his Royal Highness the Prince is pleased to give
a Gold Plate, value One Hundred Guineas to be run for
at Black Hambleton in Yorkshire, over the four Miles old
Beacon course, the last Thursday in July, by any Horse five
years old last Foaling time: No Horse to be admitted to
run but such as bring a Certificate from the Breeder of his
Horses Age; and likewise to be judged and approved to be
no older than aforesaid, by the Gentlemen whose Horses run
for the said Plate; each horse to carry ten Stone weight,
and start at the usual hours.</p>
   <p>'And his Royal Highness is also pleased to give another
Gold Plate, Value One Hundred Guineas, to be run for the

be admitted to run for either of those Plates: Although for
the future his Royal Highness designs to give a Plate of the
like Value, to be run for at each of the aforesaid Courses by
Mares only, of the said Age.' </p>
   <p>Indeed, in that year of <date value="1705">1705</date> the royal couple seemed
mightily given to racing, for  'the queen has appointed
horse races to be at Datchet after her return from Winchester

and in the same year one was run for at Ascot Heath
on August 12-the first mention that I can find of racing
there ; in <date value="1714">1714</date>, Clifton Ings, on July 28.</p>
   <p>A few racing mems of this time will illustrate to what an
extent this passion for the turf was carried. <date value="1702">1702</date>:  'They
write from <placeName key="Newmarket">Newmarket</placeName>, That the Lord Godolphin's and

sporting paper is  'News from New Market: or An Account

recorded during the reign: they were generally for 200 or
300 guineas.</p>
   <p> <persName key="Luttrell,Narcissus">Luttrell</persName> records a somewhat singular match against time:
 '14 April <date value="1709">1709</date>. Some days since, a baker at Clerkenwell

   <p>The first mention, in this reign, of Epsom Races, as far
as I can find, is in the <hi rend="italics">London Gazette</hi> April and May 26/3,
<date value="1703">1703</date>, when three small plates were to be run for, of 30&amp;pound;., 10&amp;pound;.,
and 5&amp;pound;. value. On May 25, <date value="1704">1704</date>, there was only one to be
competed for, and that of 20&amp;pound;. They had very early  ' Epsom
Spring Meetings' ; for, in the <hi rend="italics">Daily Courant</hi>, February 15,
<date value="1709">1709</date>, it says:  'On Epsom Downes in Surrey, on the first
Monday after the Frost, a Plate of 20l. will be run for,'  etc.</p>
   <p>Races for stakes of little value were common all over the
country, and were deemed of sufficient importance to be
advertised in the London papers. Take a few haphazard:
Nottingham, Kerfall, Boston, Winchester, Croydon, Coventry,
Quainton, Horsham, Woodstock, Mansfield; nay, there was
even a  'Jockey Field betwixt Bedford Row and Gray's Inn,
having a full Prospect of <placeName key="Hampstead">Hampstead</placeName> and <placeName key="Highgate">Highgate</placeName>.' </p>
   <p>What a vast difference there was between those old
racecourses and ours! No grand stands, no howling ring, no
carriages, no ladies; not even a special dress for the jockeys.
According to a nearly contemporary print, there were very
few spectators even-and but a sorry booth, or so, for the sale
of liquor.</p>
   <p>The most famous sporting man of his time was
<persName key="Frampton,Tregonwell">Tregonwell Frampton</persName>, Esq., of Moreton, Dorsetshire,  'the Father of the
Turf,'  who was keeper of her Majesty's running horses at
<placeName key="Newmarket">Newmarket</placeName>-a post he had filled in the time of William III.,
and which he continued to hold under Georges I. and II. He
is described as being  'the oldest, and as they say the cunningest
jockey in England; one day. he lost 1,000 gs., the next he
won 2,000, and so alternately. He made as light of throwing
away 500l. or 1,000l. at a time, as other men do of their
pocket money, and was perfectly calm, cheerful and
unconcerned when he lost a thousand pounds as when he won it.'
This may be true, but I find no record of his running for any

   <p>Thus we see he owned many horses, but the most famous
of all was one named Dragon, to whom it is alleged <persName key="Frampton,Tregonwell">Frampton</persName>
behaved with cruel barbarity. On Oct. 30, <date value="1712">1712</date>, Dragon ran
against Lord Dorchester's Wanton for three hundred guineas,

for the same stakes. His alleged mutilation and death are
told by Dr. John Hawkesworth in No. 37 of <hi rend="italics">The Adventurer</hi>.</p>
<p>There is no record of his death, but in an old song, called
 '<placeName key="Newmarket">Newmarket</placeName> Horse Race,'  belonging to the early part of
George the First's reign, it says-
         <quote rend="blockquote"><l>For I'll have the brown Bay, if the blew bonnet ride,</l>

</p>
<p>which would infer that Dragon was old and worthless as a
racer before his death, and the other story falls to the
ground.</p>
  <p> When young, the Queen was very fond of hunting, and,
in fact, pursued it after her accession to the throne, when,
from her increasing size, she no longer mounted the saddle.
 'The Queen came last Thursday to Hampton Court, and
having assisted in council, and dined there, returned at night
to Windsor, where she takes the divertisement of hunting
almost every day in an open Calash in the forest,' <note place="foot" n="4"><persName key="Luttrell,Narcissus">Luttrell</persName>, Aug. 15, <date value="1702">1702</date>.</note>
 i.e. she
drove down the long rides and saw what she could of the
hunt. Again,<note place="foot" n="5"><hi rend="italics">Ibid.</hi> Aug. 28, <date value="1705">1705</date>.</note>
 three years later:  'This morning her Majestie
and the prince went for Winchester to take the diversion



<pb id="p.308" n="308"/>

of hunting.'  Still later <note place="foot" n="6">Stella.</note>
:  'The queen was hunting the stag
till four this afternoon, and she drove in her chaise, above
forty miles.' </p>
   <p>The country gentry then, as now, were ardently fond of
sport; but then the hunting field was a thoroughly
neighbourly gathering, there were no subscription packs, and no
fast trains to bring every snob that possesses, or can hire, a
 'hunter.'  The runs might not be so fast as now, nor were
they ever recorded in any sporting paper-horrible
disadvantages, doubtless, but still they brought neighbours
together, engendered a kindly feeling, and gave legitimate
occupation to people whose brains were not addled with too
much reading. Where can there be a prettier picture of
a thoroughbred old English sportsman than that which
<persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName> draws of Sir
Roger<note place="foot" n="7"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, 115.</note>:  'The Walls of his great
Hall are covered with the Horns of several kinds of Deer
that he has killed in the Chace, which he thinks the most
valuable Furniture of his House, as they afford him frequent
Topicks of Discourse, and shew that he has not been Idle.
At the lower End of the Hall, is a large Otter's Skin stuffed
with Hay, which his Mother ordered to be hung up in that
manner, and the Knight looks upon it with great Satisfaction,
because it seems he was but nine Years old when his Dog
killed him. A little Room adjoining to the Hall is a kind
of Arsenal filled with Guns of several Sizes and Inventions,
with which the Knight has made great Havock in the Woods,
and distroyed many thousands of Pheasants, Partridges, and
Woodcocks. His Stable Doors are patched with Noses that
belonged to Foxes of the Knights own hunting down. Sir
Roger shewed me one of them that for Distinction Sake has
a Brass Nail struck through it, which cost him about fifteen
Hours riding, carried him through half a dozen Counties,
killed him a Brace of Geldings, and lost above half his Dogs.
This the Knight looks upon as one of the greatest Exploits
of his Life. The perverse Widow, whom I have given some
Account of, was the Death of several Foxes; for Sir Roger
has told me that in the course of his Amours he patched
the Western Door of his Stable. Whenever the Widow was


 <pb id="p.309" n="309"/>

cruel, the Foxes were sure to pay for it. In proportion as
his Passion for the Widow abated, and old Age came on,
he left off Fox hunting; but a Hare is not yet Safe that
Sits within ten Miles of his House.' </p>
  <p> Hunting commenced both earlier in the season and in the
day than now.  'It must be imagined it was near Day when
we went to Bed and therefore could not be expected we should
get out a Hunting at Five or Six in the Morning.' <note place="foot" n="8"><hi rend="italics">The Quaker's Art of Courtship</hi>, <date value="1710">1710</date>.
</note> From a
set of nearly contemporary prints we gather that possibly
little attention was paid to earth-stopping, when fox-hunting,
for one part of the engraving shows a fox being dug out.
In another part the hounds are breaking up the fox, which
has not been denuded of his brush. Only the gentlemen
are represented as being on horseback, the huntsmen having
leaping poles. This was better for them than being mounted,
for the country was nothing like as cultivated as now, and
perfectly undrained, so that they could go straighter on foot,
and with these poles leaps could be taken that no horseman
would attempt.</p>
           <l>Nor should the Fox shun the pursuing Hound</l>
           <l>Nor the Tall Stag with branching Antlers crown'd.<note place="foot" n="9"><hi rend="italics">Rural Sports</hi>, <persName key="Gay,John">Gay</persName>, ed. <date value="1713">1713</date>
</note></l>

   <p>From the engravings referred to, we find that the stag
was first found, or harboured, with a bloodhound-the
staghounds were coupled, and let loose when wanted by the
huntsmen, who were on foot. Its death was duly celebrated
by a <soCalled>' Mort,'</soCalled> or blowing of horns, when a hunting knife was
presented to the principal man present, to cut off its head,
after everyone had passed his opinion as to his age, weight,
etc.: the deer was then carted home. Guns were carried
wherewith to shoot the stag, if necessary, when at bay.</p>
   <p>Budgell, in <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> No. 117, well describes a run after
a hare, and the discipline of the hounds who were close upon
the hare, when the huntsman threw his pole between
themthis the well-tutored dogs would not pass, and the hare was
rescued. <persName key="Gay,John">Gay</persName>, too, tells the story of a run well:-</p>

   <p>Or what better description could we have of coursing a
hare than the following:-</p>
         <l>The Greyhound now pursues the tim'rous Hare,</l>

         <l>Now Speed he doubles to regain the Way,</l>
         <l>And crushes in his Jaws the Screaming Prey.</l>
  <p> Many packs of hounds were advertised for sale during
Anne's reign-not such large packs as we now have, but
small packs, with which a man could then show sport, and yet
the keeping of which need not be costly. Two or three are
given for example's sake:  'Any Gentleman that hath a mind
to purchase a good pack of cloddy strong Hounds, fit for any
Country, from 15 couple to 10, may be accommodated,'  etc.
 'There are to be dispos'd of 18 Couple of Hare Hounds, well
siz'd and well mark'd, at reasonable rates.'  ' There are 9
Couple of good Fox Hounds (with a Tarrier) (4 Couple being
stanch finders) to be sold at a very reasonable Price. These
Hounds are as proper for Deer as Fox.'   'Lost the 16th
Instant from the Earl of Litchfield's Foxhounds in some
Woods near Crawford in Kent, a small White Beagle, with
Red Spots on her Ears, and a short Tail, (being a Tarrier),'

  <p> There were cockney hunts, with deer, both at <placeName key="Hampstead">Hampstead</placeName>

 <pb id="p.311" n="311"/>

and Muswell Hill, and live deer were bought and sold
commonly; indeed there is one advertisement which has a touch
of old Leadenhall Market about it.  'Any person who has
Beagles, Foxes or Hares to dispose of, may hear of a
Purchaser by giving Notice to the Porter at Sion Chappel near
Hamsted.' </p>
 <p>  One sport then in vogue must not be omitted from the

<p>   Angling was extensively practised, with almost the same
appliances and tackle as now, even down to the wicker creel
at the side. Will Wimble  'makes a May fly to a Miracle;
and furnishes the whole country with angle rods.'  Isaac
Walton had not long been dead (Dec. 15, <date value="1683">1683</date>), and his
disciples in the  'Contemplative Man's     Recreation'  were
many and experienced. Hear what <persName key="Gay,John">Gay</persName> says about making

   <p>Hawking, too, was a sport not then extinct, the land not
being so parcelled into fields, and fenced in, as now; so that
the flight of the birds could be easily followed. The birds
were startled by five or six spaniels trained to the work. Here
<pb n="312" id="p.312"/>

is a description of one lost by the Earl of Abingdon:  'a
small black and white Hawking Spaniel. his Hair not very
long, more black than white, long Back, with a thick Head.'
In brook hawking, men used to beat the rushes with poles,
and they also hawked partridges and pheasants. The latter
are depicted in the engraving as being poked off their roosts
with poles.</p>
   <p>They went bat-fowling with the same nets as are now
used, and they also netted partridges at night, with the aid
of a lanthorn. In wild-fowl shooting they also used a horse
for stalking. There were decoys for ducks, and we get an
insight as to how they were managed.  ' These are to give
Notice, that if any Person that understands the management
of a Decoy, wants a place, he may have one about 40 Miles
from London provided he brings a Certificate from the last
Master he served as to his ability .... he shall have as good
Wages as is usually given, or a third Bird, as he shall agree
when he seeth the Decoy.' </p>
  <p> It was not every person that might shoot game:  'The
first of them, says he, that has a Spaniel by his Side, is a
Yeoman of about an hundred Pounds a Year, an honest
Man; He is just within the Game Act and qualified to kill
an Hare or a Pheasant; he knocks down a Dinner with his
Gun twice or thrice a Week; and by that means lives much
cheaper than those who have not so good an Estate as
himself. He would be a good Neighbour if he did not destroy
so many Partridges; in short he is a very sensible man;
shoots flying; and has been several times foreman of the Petty
Jury.'  <note place="foot" n="11"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 122.</note>
This game Act, which he was just within, was the
3rd James I. cap. 14, clause 5, which says that no one not
having forty pounds per annum, or 200&amp;pound;. worth of goods and
chattels, may shoot game; and should they do so, ' then any
person having lands, tenements or hereditaments, of the clear
yearly value of one hundred pounds a year, may take from
the person or possession of such malefactor or malefactors,
and to his own use for ever keep, such guns, bows,
crossbows, &amp;c. &amp;c,'  and this Act was in force till <date value="1827">1827</date>, when it
was repealed.</p>


          <pb n=" 13" id="p.313"/>

 <p>Shooting flying was not an ordinary accomplishment: it
was but just coming in, and most people took  'pot shots,'
and would not risk shooting at a bird on the wing.</p>
          <l>The dreadful Sound the springing Pheasant hears</l>
          <l>Leaves his Close Haunt, and to some Tree repairs;</l>
          <l>The Dog, aloft the painted Fowl surveys,</l>
          <l>Observes his Motions, and at distance Bays.</l>

          <l>Fear binds his Feet, and useless Pinions ties,</l>
          <l>Till the sure Fowler, with a sudden Aim,</l>
          <l>From the tall Bough, precipitates the Game.</l>

   <p>Partridges, because they flew well, and strongly, were then
not shot, but snared, by means of a trained dog.</p>

         <l>Now the warm Scent assumes the Covey near,</l>
         <l>He treads with Caution, and he points with Fear.</l>
         <l>Then lest some Sentry Fowl his Fraud descry,</l>
         <l>And bid his Fellows from the Danger fly,</l>
         <l>Close to the Ground in Expectation lies,</l>
         <l>Till in the Snare the flutt'ring Covey rise.</l>

  <p>  'But if I miss Sitting, I commonly hit 'em Flying,'  says
Bellair in <persName key="Centlivre,Susannah">Mrs. Centlivre</persName>'s  'Love at a Venture,'  which shows
that it was only when the former failed, that he tried the
latter plan. And, in an advertisement for a gamekeeper, it
is noticed:  ' Any one that is a very good Coach man, and
can Shoot flying, perfectly well, may hear of a good Place.'
If being a good coachman was useful to a gamekeeper, what
can we say to this:  'Any Gentleman that wants a Man for
Shooting, Hunting, Setting, or any Manner of Game, may
hear of one well qualified. He is a good Scholar, and shaves
well.' </p>
  <p> <persName key="Luttrell,Narcissus">Luttrell</persName> notes, Mar.  5, <date value="1707">1707</date> :  'Yesterday the lords past
the bill for the preservation of the game, in which is a clause,

unless he has a certificate from the lord of the mannor that

   <p>There were rifle matches in those day. One was shot at
the artillery ground, Finsbury, on July 16, <date value="1703">1703</date>, for a cup
value twenty-five guineas:  'No gun to exceed 4 foot and a

to be shot for more than once-and the prize once sank as
low as ' a pair of breeches.'  There was one very singular
prize:  'A very fine brass Gun, in the form of a Walking
Cane, to be us'd as a Gun or Pistol, and in it a fine Prospect
Glass, and a Perpetual Almanack engrav'd about the Head,
and a Sun Dial in the Head, and several other ingenious

<p>IN those days, when everyone with any pretensions to gentility
wore a sword, and duelling was rife, it is no wonder that
exhibitions of skill in that weapon were favourites. Like
modern prize fights, they drew together all the scum and
riff-raff, as well as the gentry who were fond of so-called
sport.  They were disreputable affairs, and were decried
by every class of contemporary. The preliminaries were
swagger and bounce, as one or two out of a very large

monetary arrangement, but it is the only one in my
experience. For, in an advertisement of the usual character,
there comes:  'Note. That John Stokes fights James Harris,
and Thomas Hesgate fights John Terriwest three Bouts each
at Back Sword, for Love.' </p>

the combat duly advertised in at least one newspaper, and
the day arrived: like the bull and bear, the combatants
paraded the streets, preceded by a drum, having their sleeves
tucked up and their swords in hand. All authorities agree
that the fights were to a certain extent serious:  'The Edge
of the Sword was a little blunted, and the Care of the Prize
fighters was not so much to avoid wounding each other, as
to avoid doing it dangerously: Nevertheless, as they were
oblig'd to fight till some Blood was shed, without which no
Body would give a Farthing for the Show, they were
sometimes forc'd to play a little ruffly. I once saw a much deeper
and longer Cut given than was intended.'  <note place="foot" n="4"><persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName>.</note>

 'Great Preparations at the Bear Garden all Morning, for the
noble Tryal of Skill that is to be play'd in the Afternoon.
Seats fill'd and crowded by Two. Drums beat, Dogs yelp,
Butchers and Foot soldiers clatter their Sticks; At last the
two heroes, in their fine borrow'd Holland Shirts, mount the
Stage about Three; Cut large Collops out of one another,
to divert the Mob and Make Work for the Surgeons:
Smoking, Swearing, Drinking, Thrusting, Justling, Elbowing,
Sweating, Kicking, Cuffing all the while the Company stays.' </p>
 <p>  <persName key="Steele,Richard">Steele</persName> gives
a good account of a prize fight <note place="foot" n="6"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>,
No. 436.</note>:  'The
Combatants met in the Middle of the Stage, and shaking Hands,
as removing all malice, they retired with much Grace to the
Extremities of it; from whence they immediately faced about,
and approached each other, Miller with an Heart full of
Resolution, Buck with a watchful untroubled Countenance; Buck
regarding principally his own Defence, Miller chiefly
thoughtful of annoying his Opponent. It is not easie to describe
the many Escapes and imperceptible Defences between Two
Men of quick Eyes, and ready Limbs; but Miller's Heat laid
him open to the Rebuke of the calm Buck, by a large Cut on
the Forehead. Much Effusion of Blood covered his Eyes in
a Moment, and the Huzzas of the Crowd undoubtedly
quickened his Anguish. The Assembly was divided into Parties
upon their different ways of Fighting: while a poor Nymph



<pb id="p.318" n="318"/>

in one of the Galleries apparently suffered for Miller, and
burst into a Flood of Tears. As soon as his Wound was
wrapped up, he came on again in a little Rage, which still
disabled him further. But what brave Man can be wounded
with more Patience and Caution ? The next was a warm
eager Onset, which ended in a decisive Stroke on the Left Leg
of Miller. The Lady in the Gallery, during the second Strife,
covered her Face; and for my Part, I could not keep my
thoughts from being mostly employed on the Consideration
of her unhappy Circumstance that Moment, hearing the Clash
of Swords, and apprehending Life or Victory concerned her
Lover in every Blow, but not daring to satisfie herself on
whom they fell. The Wound was exposed to the View of
all who could delight in it, and sowed up on the Stage. The
surly Second of Miller declared at this Time, that he would
that Day Fortnight fight Mr. Buck at the Same Weapons,
declaring himself the Master of the renowned German; but
Buck denied him the Honour of that Courageous Disciple,
and asserting that he himself had taught that Champion
accepted the Challenge.' </p>
   <p>I have been, to my great regret, unable to find a
contemporary print of one of these combats; the nearest
approach to it being the fight between Dr. Sacheverel and
Dr. Hoadley, which furnishes a graphic, though burlesque,
representation of the scene.</p>
   <p>Looking at the class from which these gladiators sprung,
it is not surprising to hear that some of these prize fights
were pre-arranged, or, to use modern slang,  'squared.'  In
<hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> 449 is a letter, from which the following is an
extract:  'Being in a Box at an Alehouse, near that renowned
Seat of Honour above mentioned, <note place="foot" n="7"><hi rend="italics">Hockley in the Hole.</hi></note> I overheard two Masters
of the Science agreeing to quarrel on the next Opportunity.
This was to happen in the Company of a Set of the
Fraternity of Basket Hilts, who were to meet that Evening. When
this was settled, one asked the other, Will you give Cuts or
receive? the other answered, Receive. It was replied, Are
you a Passionate Man ? No, provided you cut no more nor
no deeper than we agree.' </p>


<pb id="p.319" n="319"/>

 <p> The very children were bitten with the mania.
 'Apprentices, and all Boys of that Degree, are never without their
Cudgels, with which they fight something like the Fellows
before mention'd, only that the Cudgel is nothing but a stick;
and that a little Wicker Basket which covers the Handle of
the Stick, like the Guard of a Spanish Sword, serves the
combatants instead of defensive Arms.'  <note place="foot" n="8"><persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName>.</note>
</p>
   <p>This sword-fighting, however, was seeing its last days,
and was, in the next reign, to be superseded by pugilistic
encounters. At present, boxing, although extensively
practised, had not been reduced to a science. Whatever was it
made everybody so pugnacious ?   'Anything that looks
like fighting,'  says <persName key="Misson,Henri">Misson</persName>,  'is delicious to an Englishman.
If two little Boys quarrel in the Street, the Passengers stop,
make a Ring round them in a Moment, and set them against
one another, that they may come to Fisticuffs. When 'tis
come to a Fight, each pulls off his Neckcloth and his
Waistcoat, and give them to hold to some of the Standers by;
then they begin to brandish their Fists in the Air; the Blows
are aim'd all at the Face, they Kick one another's Shins, they
tug one another by the Hair &amp;c. He that has got the other
down may give him one Blow or two before he rises, but no
more; and let the Boy get up ever so often, the other is
obliged to box him again as often as he requires it. During
the Fight, the Ring of Bystanders encourage the Combatants
with great Delight of Heart, and never part them while they
fight according to the Rules. The Father and Mother of the
Boys let them fight on as well as the rest, and hearten him
that gives Ground or has the Worst.</p>
   <p>'These Combats are less frequent among grown Men than
Children, but they are not rare. If a Coachman has a
Dispute about his Fare with a Gentleman that has hired him,
and the Gentleman offers to fight him to decide the Quarrel,
the Coachman consents with all his Heart: The Gentleman
pulls off his Sword, lays it in some Shop, with his Cane,
Gloves and Cravat, and boxes in the same Manner as I have
describ'd above. If the Coachman is soundly drubb'd, which
happens almost always, that goes for payment; but if he is

<pb n="320" id="p.320"/>

the Beator, the Beatee must pay the Money about which they
quarrelled. I once saw the late Duke of Grafton at Fisticuffs
in the open Street, with such a Fellow whom he lamb'd most
horribly.' </p>
   <p>There was cudgel playing-for a new hat;  'he that
breaks most Heads to have the Hat; he that plays puts in
six-pence.'  Quarterstaff was played, and there was a
somewhat dangerous game- ' there will be three bouts with
threshing flails.'   ' A Tryal of Skill is to be fought &amp;c.
between John Parkes<note place="foot" n="9">John Parkes or Sparkes was buried at Coventry, and on his tombstone was

-They fight at the Ancient Weapon called the Threshing
Flail.' </p>
   <p>Mild athleticism seems to have obtained among a few
of the upper middle class: for instance, <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName>
speaks <note place="foot" n="10"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 115.</note>of
the dumb-bell with which he used to practise every morning,
and also of a kind of Indian club exercise, ' brandishing of
two short Sticks grasped in each Hand, and loaden with
Plugs of Lead at either End. This opens the Chest,
exercises the Limbs, and gives a Man all the Pleasure of Boxing,
without the Blows.' </p>
   <p>There were foot races, but I can find but one or two
notices of them, and there is very little like professional
pedestrianism, except the following very mild feat:  'A
Wager of 100l. was laid last week, that a German of 64 years
old, should walk in Hyde Park 300 miles in 6 dayes, which
he did within the time, and a mile over.'  <note place="foot" n="11"><persName key="Luttrell,Narcissus">Luttrell</persName>, Sept. 13, <date value="1709">1709</date>.</note></p>
   <p>Tennis was a fashionable game, although I only find one
public court mentioned,  'facing Oxenden Street near the
Haymarket.'  <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName> gets quite moral on the subject of this
game:  'Rightly considered, it's a good Emblem of the
World. As thus: the Gamesters are the Great Men, the
Rackets are the Laws, which they hold fast in their Hands,
and the Balls are we little Mortals which they bandy
backwards or forwards from one to t'other as their own Wills and
Pleasure directs 'em.' </p>

   <pb id="p.321" n="321"/>

  <p>Cricket was played, and sufficient interest was felt in the
matches: on one or two occasions they were advertised in
the newspapers. In <date value="1705">1705</date>:  'This is to give notice, That a
Match at Cricket is to be plai'd between 11 Gentlemen of
the West part of the County of Kent against as many of
Chatham for 11 Guineas a man, at Mauldon in Kent on the
7th of August next.'  And in <date value="1707">1707</date>:  'There will be two
great Matches at Cricket plaid, between London and
Croydon; the first at Croydon on Tuesday July 1, and the
other to be plaid in Lamb's Conduit Fields near <placeName key="Holborn">Holborn</placeName>, on
the Thursday following, being the 3rd of July.' </p>
   <p>On the approach of winter football came into vogue, and
it was played in the streets.

    <p>Skating, although practised here in the time of Fitz-Stephen,
had fallen into desuetude, until it was reintroduced
by the Cavaliers who had been with Charles II. in Holland.
<persName key="Pepys,Samuel">Pepys</persName> thought it was  'a very pretty art,'  yet got very nervous
over the Duke of York's skating.  ' To the Duke, and
followed him into the Parke, where, though the ice was broken
and dangerous, yet he would go slide upon his scates, which
I did not like, but he slides very well.'  Skating was popular
in London in Anne's reign, but it is doubtful whether it
obtained in the remote parts of the country. Writes <persName key="Swift,Jonathan">Swift</persName>
to Stella, Jan. 31, <date value="1711">1711</date>:  'The Canal and Rosamonds Pond

full of the rabble sliding, and with skates, if you know what
those are.' </p>
    <p> 'The Gentile, cleanly and most ingenious Game at
Billiards'  was a resource at home; and it was played on a
table like ours-an oblong wooden table, covered with green
cloth, and with pockets of netting, in precisely the same
position as now, the cushions being stuffed with fine flax or
cotton. The game was not played as we play it, but there
were two balls, a port or archway at one end, and a king or
cone at the other. The cues were not like ours, but more
like maces, only much heavier.   'Your Sticks ought to be
heavy, made of Brazile Lignum Vitae, or some other weighty

 wood which at the broad end must be
                       tipt with Ivory.'  The game was not
                       only played in private, but in coffee,
                       houses.  'At the Greyhound Coffee
                       House near Monmouth Street in Soho,
                       are to be sold two new Billiard Tables,
                       and all other goods and conveniences
                       fit for a Coffee House,'  etc. And
                       again:  'A very good French Billiard
                       Table little the worse for wearing,
                       full size, with all the Materials fit for

                       at Scot's  Coffee House.'    Indeed
Cotton says there were few towns of note in England which
had not a public billiard-table. He, however, warns people
against  ' those spunging Caterpillars, which swarm where any
Billiard Tables are set up, who make that single room their
Shop, Kitching and Bed Chamber.' </p>
   <p>The rough sports, such as cudgel-playing, football,
wrestling, throwing, boxing, leaping, and running, were kept alive
by the country wakes, which took place on the dedication
festival of the parish church. These were sometimes
supplemented by a grinning match, such as that which drew down

<persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName>'s
wrath,<note place="foot" n="15">Specator, No. 173.</note> and which was afterwards abandoned, in
deference to his opinion.</p>
    <p>Near London these wakes, like <placeName key="Hampstead">Hampstead</placeName> or Deptford
wakes, were well kept up; and there was my Lady
Butterfield in Epping Forest, of whose entertainment and
calfroasting we have already had a description through <persName key="Ward,Ned">Ward</persName>'s
instrumentality. Here is one of her advertisements:  'My
Lady Butterfield gives a Challenge to all England, to Ride
a Horse, Leap a Horse, Run on Foot or Hallow with any
Woman in England Ten years younger, but not a Day
older, because she would not under value herself. Gentlemen

   <p>She had a rival later on, in <date value="1713">1713</date>.  'This is to acquaint
all Jolly Lads and Lasses.  That on Monday the 28th
Instant, there will be a Meeting of several Gentlemen and
Ladies at the Opening of Mr. Tucker's new House upon
Epping Forest, where the Company will be provided with
good Music and Dancing, and be likewise entertain'd by
Country People with the following Diversions, viz. A Beaver
Hat to be Cudgell'd for, A Pair of Buckskin Breeches to be
wrestled for; and a lac'd Holland Smock to be danced for,
by 6 young Women. N.B. The Sport begins at 10 a Clock



<pb n="324" id="p.324"/>

in the Morning; and such care is taken that the Company
may not return a hungry, One Ox will then be roasted and
given gratis.' </p>
   <p>Women raced for smocks, silk stockings, or topknots;
whilst one would surely have won Sir John Astley's heart.
 'This is to give Notice, That there is a young Woman,
born within 30 Miles of London, will run, for Fifty or a
Hundred Pounds, a Mile and an half, with any other Woman
that has liv'd a Year within the same Distance; upon any
good Ground, as the Parties concern'd shall agree to.' </p>
   <p>Even a woman's suspected infidelity was turned into
sport.  'At Hammersmith near <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, to morrow, being
Friday, will be rode a SKIMMINGTON TRIUMPH, according
to the Manner described in Hudibras,'  which the reader will
find, if he be curious in the matter, in Part. II. Canto II. of
Butler's immortal poem.</p>
   <p>One harmless diversion should not be passed over.  'At
Epsom Old Wells . . . on Whitsun Tuesday will be Moris
Dancing Set against Set, for Lac'd Hats, at 10 a Clock, with
other Diversions.' </p>
   <p>But the game, par excellence, which combined out-of-door
sport with the minimum of fatigue, suitable alike to the
mercurial young, and the steady middle-aged, was bowling;
and the bowling greens multiplied exceedingly in this reign,
especially (judging by the advertisements) after <date value="1706">1706</date>. We
hear of them starting up in all the suburbs: at Putney,
Hoxton, Maribone, <placeName key="Hampstead">Hampstead</placeName>, Stoke Newington, Ham
Lane, etc.</p>
   <p>That the bowls were the same as are now played with
we see by the following advertisement:  ' Lost out of the
Bowl House belonging to Pemlico Green in Hogsdon near
Shoreditch two pair of Lignum Vitae Bowls and one pair of a
reddish Wood.'  It was not an expensive recreation.  'The
New Green over against Bunhill fields will be open'd on
Saturday next, and the Old Green to be Bowled on for Six
Pence and One Penny for taking up.'  Sometimes there were
prizes bowled for, as  'At the Black Gray hound Dog at
Bristow Causey, will be a Silver Tobacco Box Bouled for,
value 30s.' </p>
 <pb id="p.325" n="325"/>

  <p>It was essentially a sober cit's amusement.   ' I wonder
how so many Fat Gentlemen can endure the Green all Day,
tho' tis pleasant enough to look out o' the window and
observe 'em-To see a Tun o' Grease, with a broad fiery
Face, and a little black cap, waddle after a Bowl, rub, rub,

  'A Bowling Green is a Place where there are three Things
thrown away besides Bowls, viz. Time, Money, and Curses;
the last ten for one.  The best Sport in it, is a sight of the
Gamesters, and the looker on enjoys it more than him that
Plays. It is the School of Wrangling, nay worse than the
Schools, for Men will cavil here for a Hair's bredth, and
make a Dispute, where a Straw might end the Controversie.

 A great nuisance in these public bowling-grounds
were the people who betted on the players' skill.  'Cuff.

 It must have delighted a gardener's heart, in those days, to
have had something which must, almost of necessity, be
ornamented in a somewhat formal manner. There were no
landscape gardeners then, they were all fettered by the precision
style of elaborate parterres, terraces, cut trees, statuary;
and although a more educated mind pined for a better
state of things, as is evidenced throughout the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>

<pb n="326" id="p.326"/>

whenever mention is made of a garden, the tyranny
of custom  and the gardeners prevailed.   'Our trees rise
in Cones, Globes, and Pyramids. We see the Marks of
the Scissors upon every Plant and Bush. I do not know
whether I am singular in my Opinion, but, for my own part,
I would rather look upon a Tree in all its Luxuriancy and
Diffusion of Boughs and Branches, than when it is thus cut
and trimmed into a Mathematical Figure; and cannot but
fancy that an Orchard in flower looks infinitely more
delightful than all the little Labyrinths of the most finished
Parterre.'  <note place="foot" n="20"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 414.</note> These parterres were made in as elaborate devices
as some of our specimens of leaf-gardening, and looked very
formal.</p>
  <p> In the <hi rend="italics">Guardian</hi> (No. 173) this practice of clipping trees
is ridiculed most unmercifully.  'I know an eminent cook,
who beautified his Country seat with a Coronation dinner in
greens; where you see the Champion flourishing on
horseback at one end of the table, and the queen in perpetual
youth at the other. For the benefit of all my loving
Countrymen of this Curious taste, I shall here publish a Catalogue of
greens to be disposed of by an eminent town gardener....

  <p> 'St. George in box; his arm scarce long enough, but

   <p>'A pair of Giants stunted, to be sold Cheap.</p>
  <p> 'A quickset hedge, shot up into a porcupine, by its being
forgot a week in rainy weather,'  etc.</p>
   <p>There were many works on gardening published in this
reign, notably that by James, which was a translation from
the French. It is enriched with beautiful designs for
parterres, etc., and is undoubtedly the handsomest work on the
subject. Van Oosten's  'Dutch Gardener'  is another
translation, as is  'the Retir'd Gard'ner'  of London and Wise. The
latter is a book of about 800 pages, with several woodcuts


<pb id="p.327" n="327"/>
and copperplate engravings, and consists of two parts-one
a translation of  'Le Jardinier Solitaire,'  and the other from
the work of the Sieur Louis Ligers. This was edited by
George London and Henry Wise, who are more than once
mentioned in the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>. They were practical gardeners,
and their nurseries far surpassed all others in England.
London was chief gardener to William and Mary, and
afterwards to Anne. During her reign the nurseries were
let to a man named Swinburne, but the name of the original
firm was still kept up.</p>
   <p>There is, however, an excellent book in English called
 'the Clergy Man's Recreation,'  by John Laurence, A.M., <date value="1714">1714</date>,
but it is all about the cultivation of fruit trees.</p>
   <p>Plants would even grow out of doors in the City then,
and we find the fore courts of houses planted, or at all events
the walls covered, with jasmines, vines, etc. Whilst the
newspapers advertise for sale,  'Yews, Hollys and all sorts of

Vitae,'  and amongst the flowers were  'Double Emonies,
Ranckilos, Tulips, Aurickelouses, Double Anemonies, Double
Ranunculos and Double Junquils.'   Ranunculus seems to
have been a puzzling word, for once again we find it spelt
 ' Renunculices.' </p>
    <p>Town and country were eminently antagonistic. The
want of means of communication kept country people in a
state of stagnation, compared to their brethren of the town,
whose more fastidious taste could not brook the boorish
behaviour, and coarse pleasures, of the countryman.</p>
    <p> ' <hi rend="italics">Woodcock</hi>. No Londiner shall either ruin my Daughter,
 or waste my Estate-If he be a Gamester 'tis rattl'd away
 in two Nights-If a lewd fellow, 'tis divided into
Settlements-If a nice Fop, then my Cherry trees are cut down
 to make Terras-Walks, my Ancient Mannor House, that's
 noted for good Eating, demolish'd to Build up a Modern
 Kickshaw, like my Lord Courtair's Seat about a Mile off,
 with Sashes, Pictures and China; but never any Victuals

Gentleman, you'd Sacrifice her to a Brute; who has neither
Manners enough to be thought Rational, Education enough
for a Justice of the Peace, nor wit enough to distinguish fine
Conversation from the Yelping of Dogs; Hunts all the
Morning, topes all the Afternoon, and then goes lovingly
Drunk to Bed to his Wife.</p>
  <p> ' <hi rend="italics">Woodcock</hi>. And pray, what are your Town
Diversions ? To hear a parcel of Italian Eunuchs, like so many
Cats, squawll out somewhat you don't understand. The
Song of my Lady's Birthday, by an honest Farmer, and a
Merry Jig by a Country Wench that has Humour in her
Buttocks, is worth Forty on't; Your Plays, your Park, and all
your Town Diversions together, don't afford half so
substantial a Joy as going home thoroughly wet and dirty after
a fatiguing Fox Chace, and Shifting one's self by a good
Fire. Neither are we Country Gentlemen such Ninnies as
you make us; we have good Estates, therefore want not the
Knavery and Cunning of the Town; but we are Loyal
Subjects, true Friends, and never scruple to take our Bottle,
because we are guilty of nothing which we are afraid of
discovering in our Cups.' <note place="foot" n="21"><hi rend="italics">Tunbridge Walks</hi>.</note>
  A very pretty quarrel as it stood,
and one on which, as Sir Roger remarked, ' much might be
said on both sides,'  for <persName key="Addison,Joseph">Addison</persName><note><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, No. 119.</note> rather grumbles at the
old-fashioned courtesy of the well-bred squire, as opposed to
the greater ease of manners then in vogue:  'If, after this,
we look on the People of Mode in the Country, we find in
them the Manners of the last Age. They have no sooner
fetched themselves up to the Fashion of the polite World,
but the Town has dropped them, and are nearer to the first
State of Nature than to those refinements which formerly
reign'd in the Court, and still prevail in the Country. One
may now know a Man that never conversed in the World,
by his Excess of Good Breeding. A polite Country Squire
shall make you as many Bows in half an hour, as would
serve a Courtier for a Week. There is infinitely more to

do about Place and Precedency in a meeting of Justices
Wives, than in an Assembly of Dutchesses.' </p>
   <p>But if the country aristocracy were so behindhand, in
what state were the labourers? Their lot was hard work
and scant wage, only relieved by a village wake or a country
fair; no education, no hope of any better position, of the
earth, earthy; a man rose at early morning, worked hard all
day, came home to sleep, and so on without intermission.

<p>    The dress of the labourer at this time was a
broadbrimmed flap felt hat, a jerkin, or short coat, knee breeches
and stockings; whilst the women wore their dresses very
plainly made-necessarily without furbelows and hoops, and,
for headgear, had a very sensible broad-brimmed straw hat,
or, on holidays, the high-crowned felt hat.</p>
