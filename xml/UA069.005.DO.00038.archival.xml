                 <head>PREFACE</head>

  <p>THE present work aims at completing the History
of England for the Middle Forms of Schools, of which
the First Part, by Professor F. York Powell, was published in <date value="1885">1885</date>.</p>
  <p>The writer has striven to base his book on the
general plan followed by Mr. York Powell, to whose
constant and ungrudging counsel and aid he desires
to express the warmest obligations. He has tried
to make it a practical class-book, which should be
readable as well as useful for reference and study,
and which should suit the teacher as well as the pupil.
He has sought by constant reference to and citation
of contemporary authorities to help the student to
realise how history is made, though he has found it
impossible to do this so fully in modern times as has
been done in the former part dealing with the Middle
Ages.  His wish has been to base his arrangement
on the lines suggested by the facts themselves, and
to give a careful and unbiassed statement of the main
events of importance, their causes and results. In


<pb id="p.viii" n="viii"/>


addition to the political and military history of the nation,
its religious, moral, intellectual, and industrial life have
been carefully if briefly treated, nor have even the
manners and amusements of the people been wholly
ignored. The writer feels keenly the inadequacy and
meagreness of some parts of the descriptive chapters,
and in particular the small space he has been able
to assign to the history of literature and art. But he
hopes that even a few sentences may not be without
their value in assisting the young student to realise
the national development as a many-sided whole. For
similar reasons he has endeavoured to make the book a
history not merely of England, or England and Wales,
in the narrower sense, but of the whole British Empire,
and has given as much space as he could command to
the history of Scotland and Ireland, our old and new
Colonial Empires, and the British domination in India.</p>
  <p>The author wishes to thank many friends for advice,
help, and correction, and particularly the Rev. A. B.
Beaven of Preston, who has kindly read a great portion
of the work in proof, and has made many useful
suggestions.</p>

<p>THE Revolution completed the work that the Long Parliament
had already more than half done, but which in some
ways the Restoration bade fair to undo.</p>
  <p>It put an end to the doctrines of Divine Right and Passive
Obedience which had raised the monarchy into a sort of
sacred position far above human law. It made the king the
first magistrate of a free state, with definite work to do. If
he neglected it he could be sent about his business. It cut
down his legal powers wherever they seemed dangerous.</p>
  <p>It secured the triumph of Parliament over the Crown.
The triumph of Parliament meant, in the long run, the
triumph of the Commons, who now gradually got into their
hands most of the powers that the Constitution still left to
the king. The king's ministers soon became in reality the
ministers of the Commons, who thus got the control of the
executive power. But the Commons were a close body,
mostly consisting of landlords and rich gentlemen. Their
triumph made England an aristocracy instead of a monarchy.
Side by side with the legal constitution grew a new
customary constitution that superseded it. Cabinet government,
aristocratic influence, constitutional monarchy were
the chief notes of the new period. But the changes were
less in form than in spirit.</p>
  <p>The Revolution brought about equal changes in the
Church. It destroyed the strong priestly power which for
a century had been the one great support of monarchy.
But Puritanism as well as Anglicanism gave way before the
new spirit of Rationalism. The Dissenters got Toleration.



<pb id="p.2" n="2"/>


Yet the constitution of the Church was not altered, despite
the new spirit that came over it.</p>
  <p>The Revolution brought some sort of civil liberty to
Scotland with that form of church government which the
Scots liked best. It finally led to the union of Scotland
with England. To Ireland it simply renewed in a more
grievous form the Protestant and English ascendency.</p>
  <p>The Revolution restored England to its right place as a
great power in Europe. The first result was the fall of the
French supremacy over Europe.</p>
  <p>The Revolution made England the greatest commercial
and maritime state in Europe. When waging war to uphold
her political interests and the balance of power, England now
keeps a keen eye on winning advantages for her trade. Her
navy now becomes her chief care. Her colonies and trading
stations spread her name and tongue over every continent.</p>
  <p>But tendencies work slowly, and in England perhaps
more slowly than anywhere. It took two generations for
all these great changes to be carried out, and even then
plenty of traces remained of the old state of things.</p>
  <p>The new system makes a fair start under <persName key="William III.">William III.</persName>
Under <persName key="Anne">Anne</persName> we seem in some ways to be back in <persName key="Charles II.">Charles II.</persName>'s
time. The reigns of the two Georges mark the
completion of the change.</p></div2 >

   <p>1. <note place="foot" n="1">The New Ministry, <date value="1689">1689</date>.</note><persName key="William III.">William</persName>'s first business was to choose his ministers.
 Called in by a body of Whig and Tory gentlemen, he would
 not be the king of one party, and took care that
 both should be represented in his cabinet.
 The chief Tory ministers were Danby, now President of the
 Council and Marquis of Carmarthen, and Daniel Finch,
 Earl of Nottingham, Secretary of State.  Nottingham
 was a very strong churchman. In appearance he was <quote>" a
 very tall, thin, swarthy-complexioned man like a Spaniard
 or Jew,"</quote> <quote>"in his habit and manners very formal,"</quote> so that
 he was called Don Diego Dismallo by the Whig wits.
 Sidney, Lord <persName key="Godolphin, Sidney">Godolphin</persName>, who had been with <persName key="James II.">James</persName> to the

last, soon became First Lord of the Treasury. He was <quote>"of
low stature, thin, with a very black and stern countenance,"</quote>
but <quote>"modest in his behaviour, speaks not much, but is affable
in his manner when he is pleased."</quote> His quiet business-like
habits, great knowledge of figures, and unobtrusive usefulness
soon made him as necessary to <persName key="William III.">William</persName> as to <persName key="James II.">James</persName>.
Halifax, as Privy Seal, represented the Trimmers. The most
prominent Whig was the young Earl of Shrewsbury, who
combined great ability with <quote>"a handsome person (though
with but one eye) and noble and obliging manners."</quote> But
the chief household posts were given to <persName key="William III.">William</persName>'s old friends
from Holland, such as the trusty William Bentinck, soon
Earl of Portland, with his <quote>" very lofty mien, polite and graceful
yet dignified manners,"</quote> that won more recognition abroad
than with the churlish English, and the more brilliant
Arnold Joost van Keppel, after <date value="1696">1696</date> Earl of Albemarle, a
<quote>"cheerful young man, beautiful in his person."</quote>  Lord
Churchill was now made Earl of <persName key="Churchill, John, Earl of Marlborough">Marlborough</persName>. <persName key="William III.">William</persName>
himself had no notion of reigning without governing; his
long and wide experience of foreign affairs led him to act
as his own foreign minister: all the strings even of home
policy remained in his hands, though here he knew less
when and how to act.</p>
  <p>2. <note place="foot" n="2">The Convention Parliament and its work, <date value="1689">1689</date>.</note>The Convention, as in <date value="1660">1660</date>, was turned into a Parliament.
  The king was granted the <hi rend="italics">hereditary revenue for life</hi>
to support his household, but parliamentary
grants were henceforth made from year to year,
so that the king was now forced to have a
session of Parliament every year. The same object was
also got by passing for a short period a <hi rend="italics">Mutiny Act</hi>, which
allowed the king to keep discipline in the army by military
law. The abolition of the harsh and burdensome <hi rend="italics">Hearth
Tax</hi> relieved the poor. The Dissenters were rewarded by
the <hi rend="italics">Toleration Act</hi>, which gave Protestants who believed
in the Trinity the right to worship in their own chapels.
But the harsh Clarendon Code, though relaxed, was not
repealed. No one was willing to relieve the papists, and a
<hi rend="italics">Comprehension Bill</hi> to bring back moderate Dissenters to
the Church was thrown out through the opposition of the
clergy and the languid interest of the Dissenters themselves.
A new Oath of Allegiance was forced on all office-holders in
Church and State. Many of the clergy scrupled to take it,
and were turned out of their livings. Thus arose the schism
of the <hi rend="italics">Non-jurors</hi>, which was saved from being formidable
by very few laymen following the 300 clergy who refused


<pb id="p.4" n="4"/>



<note place="top" n="1">[<dateRange from="1689" to="1690">1689-1690</dateRange>.]</note>

to swear allegiance to <persName key="William III.">William</persName> and <persName key="Mary II.">Mary</persName>.    Among the
Non-jurors were Archbishop Sancroft and the holy Bishop
Ken. <persName key="William III.">William</persName> filled up their places from the party now
beginning to be called <hi rend="italics">Low Church</hi>, or <hi rend="italics">Latitudinarian.</hi>
Tillotson, Dean of St. Paul's, a liberal and fair-minded man
and a polished though cold preacher, became Archbishop
of Canterbury.   The active, fussy, good-natured Whig
partisan, Gilbert Burnet, a famous writer and preacher, was
made Bishop of Salisbury. The <hi rend="italics">High Church</hi> clergy, who
were the great majority, and who followed more closely on
the footsteps of Laud, strongly disliked <persName key="William III.">William</persName>'s Church
policy. But the mass of them took the oaths, though without
giving up their old theories of divine right and passive
obedience. They still had a strong hold over the people.</p>
  <p>The <hi rend="italics">Declaration of Right</hi> was now turned into the <hi rend="italics">Bill of
Rights,</hi> the last of the great charters of English liberty.</p>
  <quote rend="blockquote"><p>1. It enacted that all the liberties declared in the Declaration
were the ancient and indubitable rights of the English people. 2. It
declared illegal (a) the suspending power; and (b) the dispensing
power <quote>"as it hath been assumed and exercised of late"</quote> ; (c) <persName key="James II.">James</persName>'s
Court of Commissioners in ecclesiastical causes; (d) levying money
for a longer time than granted by Parliament; (e) keeping a standing
army without parliamentary consent. 3. It declared that subjects have
the right to petition the king, and that Parliaments should be freely
elected, frequently held, and have free speech. 4. It resolved that
<quote>"for the safety and welfare of this Protestant kingdom "</quote> all persons
<quote>"who profess the Popish religion or marry a papist shall be incapable
to inherit or possess the crown."</quote></p></quote>
  <p>The Convention Parliament was dissolved in January
<date value="1690">1690</date>, after wild debates and much excitement. Many Tories
were now sorry for the Revolution, and wished <persName key="James II.">James</persName> back,
while the extreme Whigs attacked <persName key="William III.">William</persName> almost as
fiercely as his uncle. The <soCalled>"foreign king"</soCalled> had already lost
his popularity.  Rival factions, war in Scotland, Ireland,
and the Continent made a bad beginning for his reign.</p>
  <p>3. <note place="foot" n="3">The Revolution in Scotland, <dateRange from="1688" to="1692">1688-92</dateRange>.</note>In Scotland the fall of the <soCalled>"tyrant"</soCalled> <persName key="James II.">James</persName> was hailed
with general delight. Popular disturbances broke out everywhere.
On Christmas Day <date value="1688-12-25">1688</date> the <soCalled>"curates"</soCalled>
(as the Episcopalian ministers were called) were,
in many cases, <soCalled>"rabbled,"</soCalled> that is, driven out with
violence and insult from their churches and manses. A
<hi rend="italics">Convention of the Estates</hi> was summoned as in England, and sat
in Edinburgh, while the Duke of Gordon held the castle for
King <persName key="James II.">James</persName>, and a Cameronian rabble poured in from the
fervid south-west. The Duke of Hamilton became President
of the Convention, where Whig feeling rose so high that


<pb id="p.5" n="5"/>


Graham of Claverhouse (now Viscount Dundee) withdrew
with his party in disgust. It was resolved that <persName key="James VII.">James VII.</persName>
had <hi rend="italics">forfeited</hi> the Scottish Crown, and a <hi rend="italics">Claim of Right</hi> was
drawn up, which declared that <quote>"prelacy and the superiority
of any office in the Church over presbyters is a great and
insupportable grievance, contrary to the inclination of the
generality of the people, and ought to be abolished."</quote> On

General Assembly of the Church (the first since <date value="1653">1653</date>) again
set up the Presbyterian system. The bishops and
non-juring ministers formed a separate Church of their own,
strongly <hi rend="italics">Jacobite</hi> (friendly to King <persName key="James II.">James</persName>), and bitterly
persecuted. But even hotter against the new settlement than
the Scottish Episcopalians were the extreme Covenanters,
indignant that the Westminster Confession, and not the
Covenant, was the standard adopted by the Assembly. They
rejected the Erastian Church and the un-Covenanted king,
and sought by secession to keep alive the true spirit of their
teacher Cameron. <persName key="William III.">William</persName>'s adviser in Scottish Church
affairs was the wise and cautious minister William Carstares,
his chaplain, who had such influence over him that he was
called <quote>"Viceroy of the kingdom and Cardinal Carstares."</quote>
Lord Melville at first acted for <persName key="William III.">William</persName> in State affairs, but
had much trouble with the factious <hi rend="italics">Club</hi> of Whig malcontents
(who aimed at an aristocratic republic) led by Hume of
Polwarth and Fletcher of Salton. But the government soon
passed to the stronger hands of James Dalrymple, Lord

judges), and Viscount Stair, and his son John, the Master
of Stair, now Secretary for Scotland.</p>

near the summit of the pass. The Lowlanders gave way at
the fierce Highland rush, but Dundee was slain in the

rallying his scattered soldiers. The stern piety of the newly raised
Cameronian regiment beat off the clansmen from the walls

his own house, and <persName key="William III.">William</persName> was undisputed King of Scots.</p>
  <p><note place="foot" n="6">The Massacre of Glencoe, <date value="1692">1692</date>. </note>Measures were taken to pacify the Highlanders. But the

to hold out as long as he could, though a few days after the
time fixed he came in and took the oath. But the
Campbells had now their chance to pay off old scores, and
the Master of Stair thought no harm in helping them,
and was glad to frighten, by a stern example, the wild
Highland savages. Through him <persName key="William III.">William</persName> signed an order

into Catholic hands, though, in his zeal to get rid of Protestantism,
he had almost destroyed the English
ascendency, and was now proposing to repeal
the Act of Settlement, and give back the land to
the old Irish landlords. After the English Revolution the
last check was withdrawn, and Tyrconnel began to aim
openly at the restoration of Irish independence. In great
alarm the Protestants rushed to arms. At Enniskillen and
Londonderry the best and bravest of Ulster Protestantism
gathered together to withstand their revolted servants.


<pb id="p.7" n="7"/>


<persName key="James II.">James II.</persName> as an Englishman had no sympathy with
Tyrconnel and the Irish; but their common Catholicism still
kept them together.  He left France for Ireland, and on
12th March <date value="1689">1689</date> landed at Kinsale, bringing with him some
French troops, and the Count of Avaux, as ambassador,
whose great aim was to <quote>"unite all the good subjects of
<persName key="James II.">James</persName> in the country under his sceptre."</quote> But <persName key="James II.">James</persName> soon
saw that there were only two parties in Ireland, the national
Irish party, who cared nothing for him personally, but
supported him as a Catholic and as the best way of getting
French help against the English, and the Protestant party,
who hated him and his creed, and looked for salvation from
William of Orange. This was soon seen when an Irish
parliament met in Dublin, including hardly any but
Catholics. It declared war against the Englishry by repealing the
Acts of Settlement and Explanation, and drew up a great Act
of Attainder which took in over 2000 people. To make up
for his want of money, <persName key="James II.">James</persName> issued a debased coinage of
brass and copper, which was to pass as if it had been silver.</p>
  <p>A deadly war of race and religion now burst out. The
Protestant strongholds at Enniskillen and Londonderry
held out bravely. The feeble walls of <placeName key="Derry">Derry</placeName> were besieged
by a great French and Catholic army, and a boom cut off
all access from the sea and the English fleet. <note place="foot" n="8">The Siege of <placeName key="Derry">Derry</placeName>, <date value="1689">1689</date>.</note>
Provisions ran short, but the starving garrison,
under the leading of Walker, a clergyman (afterwards
made Bishop of <placeName key="Derry">Derry</placeName> for his gallantry), kept body and
soul together on whatever garbage they could get, and
refused to surrender. At last on 30th July a merchant ship
sailed up Lough Foyle and broke the boom. The Catholic
army at once raised the siege. Three days later the men
of Enniskillen fought and won the <hi rend="italic">battle of Newtown Butler</hi>.</p>
   <p>General Schomberg, who as a young man had led the
 Portuguese to victory against Spain, and now in his old age
 had been turned out of France for his Protestantism, was
 at last sent with an English army to Ireland, and encamped
 near Dundalk. But a terrible sickness raged in his army,
 and he could do nothing. Next year (<date value="1690">1690</date>) <persName key="William III.">William</persName> himself
 went to Ireland. Landing at Carrickfergus, he advanced
 rapidly towards Dublin. <persName key="James II.">James</persName> resolved to hold the line
 of the river Boyne, which, dividing the counties of Louth
 and Meath, runs into the sea just below Drogheda. On 1st
 July <hi rend="italic">the battle of the Boyne</hi> was fought. <note place="foot" n="9">The Battle of the Boyne, <date value="1690">1690</date>.</note>

After a fierce struggle the Protestant army forced the
passage of the river, but Schomberg fell in the fight. <persName key="James II.">James</persName>
hurried away to Dublin, whence he soon fled to France.
<persName key="William III.">William</persName> now conquered nearly all Ireland, but the Irish at

Limerick, which <quote>"looked as if they could be knocked down

town, but failed completely, and in September <persName key="William III.">William</persName>,
despairing to capture it, went back to England. A little

  <p><note place="foot" n="10">The Treaty of Limerick, <date value="1691">1691</date>.</note>The flight of <persName key="James II.">James</persName> left the Catholics in a state of wild

France and sought to discipline their disorderly hordes. In
June the Dutch General Ginkel captured Athlone, which
commanded the passage of the Shannon. This enabled
him to invade Connaught.   On 12th July the battle of
<hi rend="italic">Aghrim</hi> was fought, in which Saint-Ruth was slain and
his army defeated with terrible slaughter. Galway was
now captured, and again the last Irish army stood at bay
at Limerick under the gallant Sarsfield.  But this time
resistance was useless, and Ginkel offered easy terms to bring
the war to an end. By the Treaty of Limerick
(October <date value="1691">1691</date>) all the Irish soldiers who chose
were shipped over to France, where many of them won
great glory in the service of King Louis. Amnesty was
promised to all who took the oath of allegiance, and the
Catholics were guaranteed the same liberties that they had
had during the reign of <persName key="Charles II.">Charles II.</persName>  But Ginkel went
beyond his powers in making these concessions, and the
Irish parliament meanly refused to be bound by them. The

odious severity was gradually imposed on the wretched
Catholics, who now atoned by a long century of degradation
and oppression for their last attempt to shake off the English

the destruction of their trade and the increased dependence
of their country upon England.</p>

Ireland, practically began to fight against England himself.
On 13th May <date value="1689-05-13">1689</date> England declared war against France,
and joined with Holland, Brandenburg, Spain, and the
Empire in the general attack upon the French King.
Nothing shows better the strong position which Louis had
won in Europe than that even with England against him
he was more than able to hold his own in the eight
years' struggle that now ensued. In <date value="1690">1690</date> Marshal
Luxemburg won a great victory over the allies at <hi rend="italic">Fleurus</hi>.
More remarkable still was the victory of Admiral Tourville
over the combined fleets of England and Holland (the
two great naval powers) off <hi rend="italic">Beachy Head</hi> (30th June).
This shameful defeat was mostly due to the
incompetence of the careless and self-indulgent Admiral, Lord
Torrington. The defeat of <persName key="James II.">James</persName> in Ireland prevented the
French from getting any good from their triumph at the
time. But <persName key="James II.">James</persName> pressed Louis to invade England, and
the treachery of some of <persName key="William III.">William</persName>'s most trusted supporters,
such as <persName key="Churchill, John, Earl of Marlborough">Marlborough</persName>, seemed to show that invasion might
bring about a Stewart restoration. All such schemes were

Tourville's fleet was dispersed, and the fear of invasion was
over.  But the French still harried English commerce.
In <date value="1693">1693</date> the great Smyrna fleet, with its rich cargoes of

hated as a silent Dutchman, selfish, cold-hearted, and with
no manners, who cared nothing for England, but wasted her
resources on a useless war, and by giving great estates to his
foreign friends and favourites. The Tories cried out against
the war, and denounced all war by land, saying that it did
not matter to England who was supreme on the Continent,
and that as long as we kept up our navy, we had better let
foreign politics alone. Faction rose high in Parliament, and
even in the Cabinet <persName key="William III.">William</persName>'s Whig and Tory ministers
wrangled fiercely with each other.</p>
<p>7. <note place="foot" n="15">The first United Ministry, <date value="1696">1696</date>.</note>The turncoat <persName key="Sunderland, Robert Spencer, Earl of">Sunderland</persName>, now again a Protestant and

favour, and shown him that a ministry drawn
from both parties could not work, and that it
was wiser to throw himself altogether into the hands of the
Whigs, who alone really wanted to carry on the French war.
In <date value="1694">1694</date> <persName key="William III.">William</persName> was forced to see the truth of this advice.
He adopted the Whig policy, and, as proofs of his
conversion, gave the royal assent to the new Triennial Act
he had previously vetoed, which declared that no
parliament should last more than three years, and in <date value="1695">1695</date> dropped
the censorship of the press, so that a swarm of political
newspapers sprang up. The great Whig Earls of Bedford
(father of William, Lord <persName key="Russell, William">Russell</persName>) and Devonshire were now
made dukes. Bit by bit the Tory ministers were forced


<pb id="p.11" n="11"/>



out of office. Almost the last to remain was Carmarthen,
recently made Duke of Leeds; but in <date value="1695">1695</date> he was proved
to have been mixed up with the corruption of the Tory
speaker, Sir John Trevor, whom the Whigs had turned out
of office. Barely escaping a second impeachment, Leeds
was now forced to give up public life, and <persName key="Godolphin, Sidney">Godolphin</persName> soon
followed him into retirement.</p>
  <p>By <date value="1696">1696</date> a united Whig ministry had been formed by the
little knot of statesmen called the <hi rend="italic">Junto</hi>. It included
<persName key="Somers, John">John Somers</persName> (Lord Keeper since <date value="1693">1693</date>, and Lord Chancellor and

and Thomas Lord Wharton, a famous party
manager, and violent partisan, <quote>" of a middling stature, fair
complexion, somewhat lean, and, though growing old, with

  <p>The establishment of the first really united ministry in
English history was the greatest indirect result of the
Revolution. It was next found out that the party in power
must be the party that was also in a majority in the House
of Commons. Every change of ministry now brought these
truths nearer home. At last the modern Cabinet system was
established, which in time entirely took away from the king
the chief share in the government of the country. But this
was a very slow process, not worked out fully until after the
accession of the house of Hanover.</p>
  <p>8. <note place="foot" n="16">Finance and Trade, <dateRange from="1692" to="1702">1692-1702</dateRange>.</note>The great expenses of the war forced Parliament to

Scotch projector <persName key="Paterson, William">Paterson</persName>, and established the Bank of

great success, because it gradually became the agent of the
State for managing the national debt, and because it was so
much safer than the goldsmiths who had hitherto taken charge
of people's money. In <date value="1695">1695</date> the worn-out silver coinage was  called in, and large amounts of new good silver coined, to
the great convenience of all traders, <persName key="Montague, Charles">Montague</persName> providing
for the outlay by his plan of Exchequer Bills. Alarmed at
the Whigs' successes in finance, the Tories started a Land
Bank, which turned out an utter failure. But the East
India Company, now getting very prosperous, was in Tory
hands. So in <date value="1698">1698</date> the Whigs got a charter for a new East
India Company, which they kept to themselves. For some
years the two companies competed fiercely one against the
other: but this harmed both alike, so that in <date value="1702">1702</date> they agreed
to unite, and in <date value="1708">1708</date> the union was completed. In every
way English commerce now grew apace. The old struggle
with the Dutch had ended by the union of the two states under
<persName key="William III.">William</persName>. But the <hi rend="italics">Navigation Act</hi> had worked its effects.
Dutch commerce was now falling behind that of England,
and required English help to protect itself against the rising
trading navy of France. One result of this growth was that
the English merchant class got much influence on English
politics, and used it in favour of the Protestant succession.</p>
  <p>9. <note place="foot" n="17"><placeName key="Darien">Darien</placeName>, <dateRange from="1695" to="1699">1695-99</dateRange>. </note>The wave of commercial prosperity reached even
Scotland, then a miserably poor and backward country, with
little trade and less wealth. But the Scots had
no chance of making money by foreign trade,
because they had no colonies of their own, and the <hi rend="italics">Navigation
Act</hi>, which treated them as foreigners, shut them out
from all trade with England and English colonies.
<persName key="Paterson, William">Paterson</persName>, already famous as the real founder of the Bank of
England, now came forward with a plan, which, he said, was to
make Scotland a new Holland or Venice, the market of
the world, and the greatest trading nation in Europe. His
scheme was to establish a Scottish colony and trading
station on the Isthmus of <placeName key="Darien">Darien</placeName> or Panama, which separates
North and South America. He believed that it would be
able to bring nearly all the trade which went round the
Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn, through his new
colony. The Scots heard with enthusiasm that they had
now a chance of getting rich. In <date value="1695">1695</date> an Act of Parliament
established a great Scottish Company, with a monopoly of
trade to Asia, Africa, and America. In <date value="1698">1698</date> <persName key="Paterson, William">Paterson</persName> and

live, and Spain, sluggish as she was, bitterly resented the
settlement of the intruders on territories long claimed as
Spanish. England would give no help; the first expedition
fled from <placeName key="Darien">Darien</placeName>; and a second one, which bravely settled
among the abandoned ruins, was soon driven out by the
Spaniards. The Scots were indignant that England had
done nothing to help them in their plan to ruin English
trade, and an angry feeling grew up between England and
Scotland. But the whole scheme showed that union of the
Crowns, without a union of the kingdoms, was more
impossible than ever, after the Revolution had destroyed the
dependence of Scotland on England, and left it free to work
out its own fate.</p>

 inheritance, when she married the French king, though

union of France and Spain would have produced, the
Dauphin gave up his claims to his younger son Philip, Duke
of Anjou. But next in succession to the Dauphin was the
Electress of Bavaria, who gave her right away to her son
Joseph, the Electoral Prince. His claims also were barred
by his grandmother Margaret's renunciation of her rights, but
the European balance of power would not be upset by the
union of Bavaria and Spain. There was yet a third claimant
in the Emperor Leopold himself (see Table), whose mother
Maria had made no renunciation like her nieces.  The
Emperor waived his right in favour of the Archduke
<persName key="Carlos II.">Charles</persName>, his second son, by his second wife. If the
renunciations held good, the Emperor's claim was best; if they
were worthless, the right of the Dauphin could hardly be
gainsaid.  But the jealousy of Europe extended almost
equally to either being made king, and as, just then, no
one wanted war, the <hi rend="italics">First Partition Treaty</hi> was secretly
signed in October <date value="1698">1698</date> at The Hague, by which England
and Holland (now always acting together, and often spoken
of shortly as the Maritime Powers) agreed with France
that the Electoral Prince was to be King of Spain and the
Indies, and Lord of the Netherlands, while, by way of
compensation for giving up her claims, France was to get
Guipuscoa and Naples, and Austria the Milanese. The
Spaniards were not so much as consulted, but when they
heard of the treaty, they were very indignant at their great
empire being cut into pieces by foreigners.</p>
  <p>In <date value="1699">1699</date> the Electoral Prince Joseph died, but the Powers
still sought to avoid war, and a <hi rend="italics">Second Partition Treaty</hi>
was signed in <date value="1700">1700</date>, by which Louis recognised the
Archduke <persName key="Carlos II.">Charles</persName> as King of Spain, and got the Milanese in
addition to the cessions of the former treaty. This meant
transferring the supremacy of Italy from the Hapsburgs to
the Bourbons. Again news of the treaty leaked out, and
the high-spirited Spaniards were more angry than ever. At
last <persName key="Carlos II.">Charles II.</persName>, worked upon by priests and women in the
French pay, made a will giving the whole succession to the
French claimant. Soon afterwards he died, and <persName key="Louis XIV.">Louis XIV.</persName>
threw over the Partition Treaty, and basely accepted the
Spanish heritage for his grandson, rejoicing that the
Pyrenees existed no longer, and that the great ambition of his
life was fulfilled. Thus all <persName key="William III.">William</persName>'s designs seemed frustrated.</p>

Ryswick; in the new Parliament which met in <date value="1698">1698</date> the

regular Tories were joined by a noisy band of discontented
Whigs that had long factiously opposed all <persName key="William III.">William</persName>'s
most cherished plans. <note place="foot" n="19">The Tory reaction, <dateRange from="1698" to="1701">1698-1701</dateRange>.</note>This new party first
showed its power by cutting down the army
to 7000 men. and sending away <persName key="William III.">William</persName>'s trusted Dutch
guards, believing that a standing army would prove, as in
the cases of Cromwell and <persName key="James II.">James II.</persName>, fatal to liberty. The
Tory Commons then plunged into a long and bitter fight
with the Whig House of Lords.   Complaining strongly,
and not without reason, of <persName key="William III.">William</persName>'s lavish grants of Irish
forfeited lands to his personal friends, the Commons passed
in <date value="1700">1700</date> a Resumption Act, and forced the reluctant Lords
to accept it, or leave the king penniless, by tacking it to a
money bill which the Lords could not alter, but only accept
or reject. <persName key="William III.">William</persName> dissolved Parliament in disgust. But
he had, unwillingly, to dismiss his Whig ministers, and
take a Tory cabinet under Rochester and <persName key="Godolphin, Sidney">Godolphin</persName>.</p>
  <p>In February <date value="1701">1701</date> the new Parliament met. <persName key="Louis XIV.">Louis XIV.</persName>
had now accepted the Spanish throne for his grandson, and
had forced the Dutch to acknowledge King Philip by
a threat of invasion. The Tory majority cared little for
the European balance, and impeached <persName key="Somers, John">Somers</persName>, Orford,
Halifax, and Portland for making the Second Partition
Treaty without the consent of Parliament. But the Lords
put difficulties in the Commons' way, and refused to give
them the time they wanted for completing the impeachment.
Like sulky children the Commons refused to appear, so the
Lords declared <persName key="Somers, John">Somers</persName> acquitted.</p>
  <p>12. <note place="foot" n="20">Act of settlement, <date value="1701">1701</date>.</note>The Commons also passed the <hi rend="italics">Act of Settlement,</hi>

son of the Princess Anne, and by <persName key="William III.">William</persName>'s
declining health. By it the Crown was
settled, after <persName key="Anne">Anne</persName>, on Sophia, electress of Hanover,
daughter of Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, the daughter of
<persName key="James I.">James I.</persName>, and her heirs, being Protestants. But in order to
annoy <persName key="William III.">William</persName>, a series of constitutional safeguards were
provided to come into operation with the succession to the
throne under the Act. The king was not to leave England
without the leave of Parliament. No minister, placeman, or
pensioner of the Crown was to sit in the House of Commons.
State business was to be transacted not in Cabinets such as
the Whigs loved, but in the Privy Council. These three
clauses, the first insulting to the Crown, the other two
preventing the growth of the Cabinet system, were repealed
under <persName key="Anne">Anne</persName>, when the present plan was brought in of making

foreigner was to hold office or receive grants from the king.
England was not to be entangled in war to protect a foreign
king's foreign dominions. Judges were to have fixed salaries,
to hold office during good behaviour, and only to be
removeable by address of Lords and Commons.</p>
  <p>13. <note place="foot" n="21">Whig reaction and European War, <dateRange from="1701" to="1702">1701-2</dateRange>.</note>The new Tories had now gone too far in persecuting
their enemies, insulting the king, and in neglecting the
honour and interests of England abroad. Yet the passing
of the Act of Settlement by them shows how completely they
had broken from the old Toryism with its theories
of divine right. A strong reaction against
them now broke out in the country. The
grand jury of Kent petitioned the Commons to turn from
profitless debating to grant supplies, and their example
told in the country. The Kentish Petition was
supplemented by the Legion Memorial, drawn up in vigorous
language by the famous Whig pamphleteer Daniel <persName key="Defoe, Daniel">Defoe</persName>.
At last Louis roused English national feeling by visiting
<persName key="James II.">James II.</persName> on his deathbed (<date value="1701">1701</date>), and promising him to
uphold his son as the true English king. <persName key="William III.">William</persName> at once
got rid of the Tory parliament and the Tory ministers, and
the new elections sent up a Whig majority, eager for war
against France. Parliament now attainted the pretended
Prince of Wales, and drew up a new abjuration oath.
Meanwhile <persName key="William III.">William</persName> was successfully building up a new
Grand Alliance against the French. But his health, always
weak, had now become deplorable, and the slight accident
of a fall from his horse, which stumbled over a mole-hill,
proved fatal. He died on 8th March <date value="1702">1702</date>, just in time to
know that England and Europe had refused to put up
tamely with a French king of Spain.</p>

few interests, caring only to amuse himself with the rougher

began to push forward Tories and High Churchmen both in
Church and State. She made <persName key="Churchill, John, Earl of Marlborough">Marlborough</persName> a
duke, and captain-general of her army. His
great friend <persName key="Godolphin, Sidney">Godolphin</persName> (whose son married

Nottingham, the strictest of Churchmen, Secretary of
State.  But <persName key="Churchill, John, Earl of Marlborough">Marlborough</persName> and <persName key="Godolphin, Sidney">Godolphin</persName>, who really
ruled the country, were afraid to go too far or to disgust
the Whig supporters of King <persName key="William III.">William</persName>'s foreign policy.
While winning over the clergy by restoring to the Church
the tenths and first-fruits, which had belonged to the
Crown since <date value="1534">1534</date> (this has been since used to increase
poor livings, and is called <hi rend="italics">Queen <persName key="Anne">Anne</persName>'s Bounty</hi>), they
were afraid to press the <hi rend="italics">Bill against Occasional
Conformity</hi>, which sought to prevent Dissenters qualifying
themselves for office by receiving once in the way the

the war, into the conduct of which <persName key="Godolphin, Sidney">Godolphin</persName> and
<persName key="Churchill, John, Earl of Marlborough">Marlborough</persName> threw their whole energy. While <persName key="Churchill, John, Earl of Marlborough">Marlborough</persName>
won great victories, <persName key="Godolphin, Sidney">Godolphin</persName> managed Parliament and
got together supplies. The custom of both armies going
into winter quarters allowed even <persName key="Churchill, John, Earl of Marlborough">Marlborough</persName> to lead his
party in Parliament as well as his army in the field.
Despairing of the extreme Tories, they sought, like <persName key="William III.">William</persName>,
to rule through a mixed ministry. But they found at last,
like <persName key="William III.">William</persName>, that the Whigs alone would really help them.
To get the Whigs on their side, they had to offend the
queen and the Church by voting against the Occasional
Conformity Bill. In <date value="1704">1704</date> Nottingham  joined Rochester
in the opposition; but the Whig House of Lords backed
up the Government, though it had great difficulties with
High-Church and Tory majorities in the Commons. At
last, in <date value="1706">1706</date>, <persName key="Churchill, John, Earl of Marlborough">Marlborough</persName> made his son-in-law,
<persName key="Sunderland, Charles Spencer, Earl of">Sunderland</persName> (son of the old adviser of <persName key="James II.">James</persName> and <persName key="William III.">William</persName>),
Secretary of State. <persName key="Sunderland, Charles Spencer, Earl of">Sunderland</persName> was a strong Whig and a friend
of the lords of the Junto still shut out from office. But the
Tory section of the Cabinet grew angry at being gradually
pushed from power, and began to intrigue against
<persName key="Churchill, John, Earl of Marlborough">Marlborough</persName>. Robert <persName key="Harley, Robert">Harley</persName>, the Tory Secretary of State, got
a place at court for his Tory High-Church cousin, Abigail
Hill, now married to a courtier named Masham. Her easy,
placid ways soon won her <persName key="Anne">Anne</persName>'s favour, especially as the
queen was getting quite tired of the Duchess of
<persName key="Churchill, John, Earl of Marlborough">Marlborough</persName>'s overbearing temper. She now told <persName key="Anne">Anne</persName> that the
Whigs were secretly plotting against the Church, and made
her thoroughly suspicious of her leading ministers.</p>

 had almost carried through. On 4th May <date value="1702">1702</date> England,
 the United Provinces, and the Emperor
 declared war against France. A whole crowd
 of lesser states followed these great Powers. The
 Elector of Brandenburg (Frederick, son of the Great Elector,
 Frederick William) was bought over to the Coalition by
 being recognised as King of Prussia. The lesser German
 states were so much afraid of Louis, that even the
 sluggish Diet of the Empire declared war. Yet Louis had great
 resources at his back.  He governed the richest, most
 compact, and in some ways the best ruled state in Europe.
 The army and fleet of France, with their famous generals
 and admirals and almost unbroken record of victories,
 were far larger and better managed than those of any
 other state. Every patriotic Castilian was deeply incensed
 at the proposed partition of the Spanish empire, and zealous
 on Louis's side.  For the first time the Spanish Netherlands,
 with their mighty fortresses, were entirely in Louis's
 hands; and he could begin the war by attacking the Dutch
 frontier. Even in Germany the Elector of Bavaria and his
 brother the Elector of Cologne were French partisans; and in
 the east the discontented Hungarians and the warlike Turks
 were their constant allies againstAustria. The Spanish
 Succession gave Louis practical command of Italy, especially as
 Victor Amadeus, Duke of Savoy and Lord of Piedmont, was
 the father-in-law of his grandson Philip of Spain.  But
 mighty as were the two great coalitions, they did not
 include the whole of Europe. While the War of the Spanish
 Succession was waged in southern and central Europe,
 another great struggle was being fought out in the north
 and east, where Charles XII., the last of the great Swedish
 monarchs, and Peter the Great, the first of the great Russian
 Czars, were engaged in a deadly fight for the supremacy of
 the Baltic lands, which ended at last by the defeat of Charles
 at Poltava (<date value="1709">1709</date>), his subsequent captivity in Turkey, and
 the complete triumph of Russia.</p>

come from <persName key="Churchill, John, Earl of Marlborough">Marlborough</persName>. But his army was hundreds of miles away
on the Lower Meuse; the armies of the time were unwieldy, and slow
in moving, and the Dutch would never lay bare their own frontiers for
the sake of their ally. Yet the great general at once made up his
mind to march with his whole force from the Lower Meuse to the
Upper Danube, though he could only get away from Holland by
pretending that he wished to fight on the Moselle. But he hurried up
the Rhine, past Coblenz and Mainz, to Mannheim, where he left the
Rhine for the hilly and picturesque vale of the Neckar, crossing safely
the rugged hills of Swabia, and reaching the Danube near Ulm.</quote>

his best chance was to crush the Bavarians before Tallard came back

stormed the strong hill called the <hi rend="italic">Schellenberg</hi>, drove out the Bavarian

claims combined with the sluggishness and fears of the
Dutch to carry on the war, and reject Louis's overtures for
peace. In England the continuance of the war now became
a mere party question, and the destinies of Europe no longer
depended on the armies in the field, but on parliamentary

The Whig House of Lords voted him guilty, but his only
punishment was three years' suspension from preaching, and
the burning of his sermons by the hangman. This sentence
made the noisy doctor a popular hero, and a most useful
electioneering agent for the Tories. Bit by bit the queen
plucked up courage to bring back the Tories into office. By
November the last of the Whigs were got rid of. The new
elections sent back a strong majority of High Church Tories
to the House of Commons, eager to upset the policy of their

refusing to end the war. They threw over their allies, who,

compensated by the cession of Milan, Naples, and <placeName key="Sardinia">Sardinia</placeName>. 3. The

interests.) 4. Sicily was ceded to the Duke of Savoy, with the title of
King. 5. Prussia was recognised as a kingdom and Hanover as an
electorate. (This treaty marks the beginning of the importance of
Savoy and Prussia.) 6. The Protestant succession in England was

George Louis (Elector since <date value="1698">1698</date>), was a decided enemy
of the peace of Utrecht, and known to be friendly to the
Whigs. If he became king there was little hope of keeping
the Tories in power. <persName key="St. John, Henry, Viscount of Bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</persName> was, above all things, a
strong party man, and though no believer in divine right,
or friend of Popery, preferred a Tory to a Whig king. So
he began to prepare the way for bringing back <persName key="Anne">Anne</persName>'s half-
brother, James, generally called the Chevalier of St. George,
or the Pretender. <persName key="Anne">Anne</persName> herself was not unwilling, and the
High Churchmen were still strongly influenced by their old
doctrines of passive obedience and divine right. If James
had not been a steadfast Roman Catholic the plan would
not have been hard, as the Hanover succession excited no
enthusiasm whatever. As it was, many strong Churchmen
forgot their Protestantism in their zeal for the Stewart
cause.</p>
  <p>Having made up his mind, <persName key="St. John, Henry, Viscount of Bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</persName> threw himself with
his usual eagerness into his new and treasonable policy,
and was actively backed up by Ormonde, Harcourt, Sir
William Wyndham, by <persName key="Atterbury, Francis">Atterbury</persName>, the fiery High Church
Bishop of Rochester, and by Dean <persName key="Swift, Jonathan">Swift</persName>. But the cautious
and vacillating <persName key="Harley, Robert">Harley</persName> could hardly be won over, so fresh
intrigues were set on foot to discredit him.</p>
 <p> Active preparations were now made to upset the Act of
Settlement. Strong efforts were made to use the
High-Church feeling in the country to get back a king who was
not a Churchman.   The clergy had already been well
rewarded for their great share in the Tory triumph. In
<date value="1711">1711</date> the <hi rend="italic">Occasional Conformity Act</hi> (which fined and
disqualified all officials who attended any conventicle, and thus
made it useless for dissenters to make themselves eligible
for municipal offices by taking the Communion once a year
in church) had been carried, Whigs vying with Tories in
supporting the bill to disprove the taunt that they were at
heart enemies of the Church, and buying thus the support
of Nottingham and a little band of discontented Tories, shut
out of the ministry. A bill was next passed to build fifty
new churches in the rapidly increasing suburbs of London,
a much-needed measure, but hardly passed from nothing
but pure zeal for religion. Finally the <hi rend="italic">Schism Act</hi> (<date value="1714">1714</date>)
was carried, which absolutely prevented any dissenter from
acting as a schoolmaster or tutor; but this never came into
operation.</p>
  <p>The Whigs were almost in despair, when the elections of
<date value="1713">1713</date> sent a new Tory parliament to Westminster. They


<pb id="p.29" n="29"/>



tried to bring the Electoral Prince of Hanover (afterwards
<persName key="George II.">George II.</persName>) to England, to take his seat in the Lords as
Duke of Cambridge; but this unwise move led only to a
personal quarrel between <persName key="Anne">Anne</persName> and the old Electress, who
died shortly after. But the Whigs' best hopes were in the
bad health of the queen and the disunion of the Cabinet. At
last the long smouldering dispute between Oxford and
<persName key="St. John, Henry, Viscount of Bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</persName> burst to a flame. On 27th July <date value="1714">1714</date> a fierce
altercation in the sick queen's presence was kept up till two in the
morning, and only ended by <persName key="Anne">Anne</persName>'s taking away from Oxford
the White Staff of the Treasurer.  Instigated by Lady
Masham, who had now deserted her cousin for <persName key="St. John, Henry, Viscount of Bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</persName>,
<persName key="Anne">Anne</persName> now complained that <quote>" he neglected all business, never

On 30th July she had a fit of apoplexy, and lay speechless and
without hope of recovery. All was now excitement.
The Whigs prepared to fight, and the
Tories did not know what to do. But the Duke
of Shrewsbury, who had begun life as a Whig but now held
office with the Tories, was at the last moment seized with
scruples. The Cabinet met at Kensington to decide on
what course to pursue.  Suddenly the Whig Dukes of
<persName key="Argyll, John Campbell, 2nd Duke of">Argyll</persName> and Somerset appeared and demanded admission
as Privy Councillors. The law knew nothing of Cabinet
Councils, and it could only be as Privy Councillors that the
ministers had met together.  Shrewsbury, by previous
arrangement, backed up their claims; and they in return
urged his appointment as Treasurer. The White Staff was
at once put into his hands by the half-unconscious and dying
queen. The three dukes now took everything upon
themselves, and prepared to secure the Protestant succession.
The baffled conspirators were quite overpowered when,
disregarding the Cabinet, the dukes got special summonses to
the Council for all the Privy Councillors, mostly Whigs,
living in London. On 1st August Queen <persName key="Anne">Anne</persName> died, and,
though some desperate men were for proclaiming the

of <date value="1688">1688</date> showed clearly that some great change
was required.  There had been much bad
blood between England and Scotland during the
time that the Stewart kings had frankly sought
 to make Scotland depend upon England.    But much
 worse feelings grew up after the Revolution left Scotland
 a small free state bound to a greater and richer one by
 no other tie than subjection to a common sovereign. Scots
 now found that they were shut off from all the sources
 of wealth which were making England the greatest
 commercial country of the world.  The <placeName key="Darien">Darien</placeName> failure had
 shown that Scotland, as the weaker power, would be obliged,
 in really essential matters, to follow the lead of England.
 The result was the bitterest ill-will between the two nations.
 Wise men, like <persName key="William III.">William III.</persName>, saw that separation or fuller
 union were now the only ways out of the deadlock. But if
 <persName key="William III.">William</persName> pressed for a union, the new <quote>"<hi rend="italic">Patriotic Party</hi>,"</quote> which
 now grew up in Scotland, would be satisfied with nothing
 less than complete separation. This party centred round the
 Club, and had for its leader Andrew Fletcher of Salton, in
 East Lothian, an aristocratic republican, like the old
 Commonwealth's men. He was <quote>"a thin man, of a brown
 complexion; full of fire, with a stern sour look; but a gentleman
 of nice honour, and abundance of learning, bold as a lion;
 a sure friend, and an irreconcilable enemy; whose thoughts
 were large as to religion,"</quote> and who <quote>" would not be under the
 distinction of a Whig or Tory, saying, those names are used
 to cloak the knaves of both."</quote> Largely through his influence
 the negotiations for union which, through <persName key="William III.">William</persName>'s
 influence, had begun in <date value="1702">1702</date>, came to an end in <date value="1703">1703</date>.</p>
 	<p>In <date value="1703">1703</date> the Scottish Parliament (still bitterly mortified by
 the <placeName key="Darien">Darien</placeName> failure) met under the Duke of Queensberry, a
 lazy and easy-tempered, but shrewd and far-seeing man, as
 Lord Commissioner. Fletcher brought forward a <hi rend="italic">Bill of
 Security</hi>, which provided that, on Queen <persName key="Anne">Anne</persName>'s death, the
 Scottish throne should go to some Protestant descendant of
 the royal house, but excluding the successor to the English
 crown, <quote>"unless the sovereignty of this kingdom, the frequency
 of its Parliaments, and its religious freedom and trade be
 secured from English or any foreign influence." </quote>Fletcher
 also proposed a series of <hi rend="italic">Limitations</hi>, in case the two
 countries remained under the same monarch which transferred


<pb id="p.31" n="31"/>



the whole executive power from the Crown to a Committee
of the Estates, while providing for parliamentary reform
and a national militia. Both measures were eagerly accepted,
and Government, though refusing to touch with the sceptre
(the way of signifying the Crown's approval of Scottish laws)
the Bill of Security, did not dare to refuse the royal assent to
the Limitations. Thereupon Fletcher carried a resolution
<quote>"that, after the decease of her Majesty, we will separate our
Crown from that of England."</quote> All subsidies were refused,
and toleration to Episcopalian dissenters contemptuously
rejected. Next year the same stormy scenes were renewed,
and the timidity of <persName key="Godolphin, Sidney">Godolphin</persName> and the new Commissioner,
the Marquis of Tweeddale, led to the royal assent being
given even to the <hi rend="italic">Act of Security</hi>.</p>
  <p>The English Parliament, not unnaturally, retaliated, the
Whigs pressing for severe measures in order to embarrass
the Tory government. All trade with Scotland was cut off,
Scots were declared aliens, Newcastle and Carlisle were
fortified, the militia of the four northern shires called out,
and all available troops marched to the Border. But the
hopelessness and wantonness of the struggle, the pressure
of the Court influence, dislike to play the game of the
Jacobites, and a shrewd sense of the benefits to be got
from commercial union gradually got the better of the
patriotic enthusiasm of the Scottish Parliament. In vain
Fletcher joined forces with the Jacobites. In <date value="1705">1705</date>
Tweeddale formed a middle party called the <hi rend="italic">Squadrone Volante</hi>
(Italian for <hi rend="italic">Flying Squadron</hi>, a name given at that time to
a party of cardinals in the papal court), which, though
professing to hold the balance between patriots and
courtiers, on the whole favoured the reasonable schemes of
union which were now brought forward. England
therefore showed a conciliatory spirit by dropping the Alien
Act.</p>
   <p>Early in <date value="1706">1706</date> both nations appointed Commissioners to
 treat for a union. Two months were spent in active
 negotiations. At last a <hi rend="italic">Treaty of Union</hi> was drawn up, and laid
 before the two Parliaments. There was nothing to fear at
 Westminster, but a last expiring effort was made at
 Edinburgh to overthrow the hated measure. Riots broke out,
 which showed the unpopularity of the Act out of doors.
 But the Duke of Hamilton (the greatest lord on the patriotic
 side, who had even hoped to become king under the Act of
 Security) lost courage at the critical moment, and in January
 <date value="1707">1707</date> the Act was passed by a majority of 40.</p>

  <quote rend="blockquote"><p>The terms of the Union were :-1. There should be one kingdom,
one Parliament, one Privy Council, one Government, and one
succession to the throne. The United Kingdom was to be called Great
Britain, and its arms and national flag, the <quote>"Union Jack,"</quote> made of
the crosses of St. George and St. Andrew combined into one. The
Scotch government departments were mostly transferred to London,
but put under a new minister, the Secretary of State for Scotland.
(In <date value="1746">1746</date> this office was abolished, and Scotch business shared by the
other two Secretaries.) 2. Scotland was to be represented in the
United Parliament by 45 commoners and 16 elected representatives
of the Scottish peerage.  3. The Presbyterian Church government
was declared <quote>"for ever unalterable, and the only government of the
Church within Scotland,"</quote> and every monarch of the United Kingdom
was required to swear at his accession to protect it.  A special
Act of Security was passed by the Scots to provide for this, and
also for the freedom of the four Scottish Universities. 4. The
Scottish legal system (so different from that of England) was not to be
affected by the Union, though there was now an appeal from the
Court of Session to the House of Lords. 5. The Scotch debt was
paid off, the <placeName key="Darien">Darien</placeName> Company dissolved, and its shareholders
compensated, and the proportion of Scotch taxation fixed.  6. The
English coinage was brought in, which was the easier, as there was
already a scarcity of the depreciated Scottish coins. 7. Complete
equality of trade between the two countries was established, so that
Scots might trade with the English colonies.</p></quote>
   <p>The Union did not at first practically affect the lawless
freedom of the Celtic Highlanders; but in the Lowlands,
which really were Scotland, it was felt as a grievous blow to
national feeling, and long remained intensely unpopular. But
the wise care taken to uphold the Scotch Church and the
Scotch law blunted the sharpest edge of hostility. Bit by bit
the opening up of trade began to work its results. Glasgow
became a great port and the rival of Bristol and <placeName key="Liverpool">Liverpool</placeName>
in the American trade. The idle and vagrant population
(which Fletcher in despair had proposed to turn into
slaves) now acquired those habits of thrift and industry
which mark the modern Scot. Mines were opened up; the
soil was tilled with more energy and success; the linen and
iron trades took a deep hold of the country; and the great
growth of trade and manufactures in the middle of the
eighteenth century completed the formation of modern
industrial Scotland. The Union Parliament proved on the
whole very careful to uphold Scottish privileges. The ill-
judged restoration of patronage in the Scottish Church by
the Tories under Queen <persName key="Anne">Anne</persName> was the only really important
instance of disregard for Scottish feeling. So gradually
the old dislike died away, though all through the eighteenth

Twice disgust for the Union made Protestant Scotland an

themselves against the animosities of centuries. The Scots
had withstood the Union, fearing for their national life.
But they got the best share of the advantages that accrued
from it, and found that their national life could still live
on even without their separate Parliament.</p></div2 >

to study the English constitution or character.
He looked on his throne in England as
giving him a stronger position in Germany. Too prudent
and sensible to offend his new subjects, he did not try to
put his friends, Bothmar and Bernstorff, into high place,
but was quite satisfied with a fair civil list, freedom to
go to Hanover when he chose and English peerages for his
German mistresses. He had been so much frightened by
the Tories that he put himself altogether into the hands of
the Whigs. The Lords Justices, chosen to rule the land
until his coming, were all Whigs. The Tory ministers were
turned out one by one, and soon after his landing a
thorough Whig ministry was appointed. In the Whig
Parliament, which met in January <date value="1715">1715</date>, Oxford was impeached
and sent to the Tower. <persName key="St. John, Henry, Viscount of Bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</persName> fled in despair to

of the day, and commanding the confidence of the majority
of the House of Commons.</hi> While the personal power of
the king was much cut down, that of the Crown as
exercised by the Cabinet grew greater and greater. The old
constitution, unchanged in form, was practically laid aside for
the <hi rend="italic">unwritten constitution of understandings or conventions</hi>
under which England has almost ever since been governed.
Many of the legal powers of the Crown fell into complete
disuse. No Hanoverian monarch has ever refused his
consent to a law passed by the Lords and Commons. The
House of Lords was no longer co-ordinate in power to
the House of Commons. But its strong Whig sympathies,
which had so often brought it into conflict with the other
House, when the Tories were uppermost, now brought
about more friendly dealings with a Whig House of
Commons.</p>
  <p>Now that Parliament had got the upper hand, and the
final authority in the country itself really rested with
the Commons, the question how the House of Commons
was chosen became for the first time an important one.
Few members were really elected by the people. The
counties, which returned two members apiece, were looked on
as the freest electing bodies, but here only landowners could
vote. There were many <quote>"rotten boroughs"</quote> with hardly any
inhabitants, and some great towns had no members. Many
were the nominees of great landowners, or of rich merchants,
or were returned by so poor or so narrow a constituency
that the government of the day could force the election of
almost any man it chose upon it. Thus <hi rend="italic">electioneering</hi>
became a regular system.  Quite as important was the
<hi rend="italic">art of parliamentary management</hi>, by which the ministry
sought to keep its hold over the members already elected.
Influence, intrigue, as well as direct and unscrupulous
bribery, were freely used. Skill in such arts gradually
threw real power into the hands of a ring of great
land-owning families.  What the king lost the great Whig
houses gained. They owned the smaller boroughs, and
could control the elections in the counties. Their favour
was the road to power and place, both in Church and State.
But, now the Whigs had the upper hand, they forgot their
old popular cries, and got out of touch with the people.
Thinking they had got all the country wanted by the
Revolution settlement, they became conservative and
opposed all new and sweeping changes.  But they gave
England fifty years of sound administration and of practical


<pb id="p.37" n="37"/>



reforms; and their calm and uneventful rule was the best
thing for the country.</p>
  <p>4. The failure of the Jacobite Rebellions in <date value="1715">1715</date> showed
both the strength and the wisdom of the new The Jacobite
government.  An elaborate plot had been rising of <date value="1715">1715</date>.
formed; parts of England and Scotland were to rise on the
same day. French help was confidently looked for by the
Tories who had carried the Treaty of Utrecht, but the death
of <persName key="Louis XIV.">Louis XIV.</persName> deprived the Pretender of his best friend, as
Philip, Duke of Orleans, the Regent for the infant Louis
XV., who now became king, was forced by the weakness of
his position to court the favour of England. All hope of
French help was thus lost. But besides their bad luck the
Jacobite leaders were very ignorant and foolish.
<persName key="St. John, Henry, Viscount of Bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</persName> was their one strong head, but <persName key="St. John, Henry, Viscount of Bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</persName> was
powerless to contend against the intriguers and blunderers
in whom alone the Pretender believed. The English
Government found out their most secret plans. Early in
<date value="1715">1715</date> the <hi rend="italic">executive power</hi> had been strengthened by the
passing of the <hi rend="italic">Riot Act</hi>.</p>
  <p><quote rend="blockquote">This made it felony for twelve or more persons, assembled against

so by a justice of the peace or other lawful authority, and enacted that
if any were killed in resisting such a dispersion, their slaying should
not be looked upon as murder.</quote></p>
   <p>Prompt vigour now nipped in the bud the movement in
England. Six Tory members of Parliament, among whom
was Sir W. Wyndham, were arrested. Oxford, where the
University was strongly Jacobite, was occupied by troops.
Ormonde landed in Devonshire, but failed to raise the
country, and retreated to France. South of the Tweed the
only actual revolt was in Northumberland, where a few
hundred insurgents gathered together under the
incompetent leadership of Thomas <persName key="Forster, Thomas">Forster</persName>, member for the county.
Being a Protestant, he was chosen as general rather than
Catholic peers like Lord Widdrington, or even <persName key="Charles II.">Charles II.</persName>'s
grandson, the chivalrous Earl of Derwentwater, <quote>"a man
formed by nature to be generally beloved."</quote></p>
  <p>5. <note place="foot" n="3">State of the Highlands.</note>In Scotland the revolt took a deeper root. The
Highlanders, whose fathers Montrose and Dundee had led to
victory, were still zealous for the Stewarts, and
the Government in Edinburgh and London
could not disarm the 30,000 clansmen ever eager to follow
their chiefs to battle. Beyond the Grampians and the
Firth of Clyde the old picturesque, disorderly Celtic tribe-system


<pb id="p.38" n="38"/>

<note place="top" n="1">[<date value="1715">1715</date>.</note>

still lived on.  There, moor and mountain kept
apart from each other and from Saxon law the little tribal
communities that swarmed in every strath and glen. The
people were poor and rude; their houses turf-walled cots;
their only wealth cattle ; their only language Gaelic. Their
national garb was a linen shirt and tartan plaid, often
varying in colour or pattern with the clan, and buckled
tight round the body so that the lower part came over the
knees, and the other was drawn up to the left shoulder.
The better off would wear over this a waistcoat and jacket
or short coat; a large skin purse hanging before the plaid;
a bonnet, in which a feather marked the gentleman, and, on
horseback, the gentry wore trews, or close-fitting breeches
and stockings, woven in one piece. Their bards and pipers
were the chroniclers of their fame, their mourners, their
encouragers to valour. They had little book-learning, and
believed in ghosts, wizards, and the evil eye, but they cared
little for the contests of Prelatists and Presbyterians, and
in some cases were professed Catholics. A French education
and loyalty to the exiled Stewarts made many of the
gentry fervent in the old faith.  Politeness, good taste,
devotion to old poetry and stories, simplicity, bravery,
contentment, self-sacrificing devotion to their chief, and
passionate love for their native glens and moors were
their highest virtues.  But they were idle, untruthful,
sullen, revengeful, and quick to shed blood. Rival clans
waged hereditary feuds with each other, but would sometimes
join in plundering the Saxons. They saw no wrong
in a creach (foray), or in lifting the cattle which cropped
the grass of their enemy. A chosen class of marauders,
the Cearnachs (Kerns), consisting mostly of the sons of
the tacksmen (lower gentry), levied systematic blackmail
on Lowland farmers and graziers, who paid the money
to save their lands from attack when the wild Highlanders
came down from the hills. The famous swordsman, Rob
Roy [Red Robert] Macgregor, was one of these.   For
thirty years he waged open war against the Duke of Montrose,
and at last died in his bed at the age of eighty, and
was followed to his grave by the whole country-side. Thirty
miles off were the garrison of Stirling and the great city of
Glasgow. Yet no law could ever reach the valiant outlaw.</p>
   <p>The old Scottish kings had long been so weak that they
had given up nearly all royal powers over the Highlands
by grants of regality and hereditary jurisdictions which
enabled the great lords that received them to govern like


<pb id="p.39" n="39"/>



<note place="top" n="1"><date value="1715">1715</date>.] </note>

kings the districts intrusted to their care, and hand on
their power to their sons. Some of these were also the
chiefs of the clans, who, if they also held hereditary
jurisdiction of the king, were in a strong legal position. But
most deference was paid to the clan chieftains' vague
patriarchal authority which no Saxon law, but time-hallowed
and strongly-binding custom, allowed them to exercise over
their dependants and kinsfolk. It was despotic, yet limited
by another custom, which gave each tenant a right to his
little holding, while the elders of the tribe held in check
weak or violent chiefs. Even when the Highlander held his
land and attended the courts of an alien landlord, he still
looked up to the chief of his clan, and followed him as of old
to battle and the chase. Yet though no clan family, the
Drummonds were, in the early years of the eighteenth
century, still proud of the dexterity of their executioner; and
the Duke ofAtholl, another border lord, condemned to death
and pardoned a criminal when entertaining Duncan Forbes
of Culloden, the famous President of the Court of Session
and the great enemy of these feudal and tribal rights.
Nevertheless those Macphersons, who were tenants on the
Atholl estates in Badenoch, followed their chief Cluny, and
not the Duke, and Atholl's Cameron tenants from Lochaber
clave in the same way to Lochiel. But of his own clan, a
thousand Stewarts of Atholl would follow him to the field.
Other great nobles at the head of clans were the cunning
Lord Lovat, the despot of the Frasers of Inverness-shire,
Lord Seaforth, the chief of the Mackenzies of Ross-shire,
Lord Reay, the head of the Mackays, and the Earl of
Sutherland, who could muster 2000 swordsmen of his clan.
But the most powerful Highland noble was the Duke of
<persName key="Argyll, John Campbell, 2nd Duke of">Argyll</persName>. Called in the Highlands the Maccallum More,
and the head of the Campbells, <persName key="Argyll, John Campbell, 2nd Duke of">Argyll</persName> and his kinsfolk
could bring 5000 men into the field to defend Whig principles,
the Protestant succession, and the Presbyterian
Church.  The other western clans, such as the Macdougalls
of Lorn, the Macleans of Douart, and the Stewarts
of Appin, were hard pressed by the cunning and aggressive
Campbells. The Campbells' most powerful rival was
the great north-western clan of the Macdonalds, whose
head was once Lord of the Isles, and who, even in their
decline, could muster 2350 men under their five chiefs,
Slate, Clanranald, Glengarry, Keppoch, and Glencoe.
Macdonald of Keppoch, says President Forbes, <quote>"was not
proprietor of a single ridge of land, but only a tacksman of


<pb id="p.40" n="40"/>

the laird of Mackintosh and the Duke of Gordon, yet he
can raise 300 followers."</quote> <quote>" The name of the clan Macgregor
(Rob Roy's clan) was called down by Act of Parliament,
and they now live dispersed under different names [such as
Campbell]. They have no present chief, that being elective,
and continuing no longer than the current expedition; they
can raise 700 men."</quote></p>
  <p>The Highlander was armed <quote>"with a gun, a strong handsome
target, with a sharp-pointed steel spike, on his arm,
a sturdy claymore [broadsword] by his side, and a pistol or
two, with a dirk [short, broad-bladed dagger], and knife in
his belt."</quote> The gentry still wore armour sometimes, and
they had only just given up bows and arrows. Each clan
made a regiment. Their invariable tactics were to advance
swiftly till within a few yards of the enemy, when they
stopped a moment, poured in a brisk volley of musketry,
and then, throwing down their guns, dashed forward, claymore
in hand, receiving and turning the enemies' bayonets
on their targets, and dealing tremendous strokes on their
hampered foes; if they were at too close quarters to wield
the broadsword, they would do deadly work with dirk and
pistol. Few of the stiff, formally-drilled troops of this time
could withstand their swift and reckless charge.</p>

King George's levee. Next day he hurried secretly to
the Highlands, where, on 6th September, he raised the
standard of James VIII. in Braemar. The clans of the
Eastern and Central Highlands soon gathered together
under his command, and, though an attempt to seize
Edinburgh Castle failed, the whole country north of the Tay
recognised the Stewart king. In the south, disgust at the
Union made even Whigs careless of King George. Both

   <p>In the hills of southern Scotland, on 12th October, Lord
 Kenmure proclaimed the Stewart king at Moffat, in
 Dumfriesshire, and gathered a force of 200 horsemen, including
 the Earls of Nithisdale, Wintoun, and Carnwath. On 19th
 October they joined the Northumbrian insurgents at
 Rothbury. Mar had lingered aimlessly at Perth, while the
 Duke of <persName key="Argyll, John Campbell, 2nd Duke of">Argyll</persName>'s army was collecting; but he now sent
 Brigadier <persName key="Mackintosh, Brigadier">Mackintosh</persName> with nearly 2000 men to make a
 diversion in the south. <persName key="Mackintosh, Brigadier">Mackintosh</persName>'s troops were ferried over the
 Forth in open boats, and their approach filled Edinburgh
 with terror.  But the arrival of <persName key="Argyll, John Campbell, 2nd Duke of">Argyll</persName> frightened them
 from attacking the city; and <persName key="Mackintosh, Brigadier">Mackintosh</persName> crossed
 Lammermoor, and soon joined Kenmure and <persName key="Forster, Thomas">Forster</persName> at Kelso.
 But the united forces marched purposelessly along the
 Cheviots, instead of turning to take <persName key="Argyll, John Campbell, 2nd Duke of">Argyll</persName> in flank, or
 advancing boldly into England to attack the army that
 General Carpenter was gathering at Newcastle. At last it
 was resolved to invade <placeName key="Lancashire">Lancashire</placeName>. The <foreign lang="LA"><hi rend="italic">posse comitatus</hi></foreign>
 of Cumberland fled in panic before them, and on 9th
 November they reached Preston, where many of the
 neighbouring Catholic gentry joined them. But Carpenter was
 coming up in their rear, and General Wills, with another
 army, was advancing from <placeName key="Manchester">Manchester</placeName>. The bridge over
 the Ribble, which might have been defended, was abandoned
 by the folly of <persName key="Forster, Thomas">Forster</persName>, and, after a show of resistance, the
 helpless chief, and his mob of bad soldiers, surrendered at
 discretion on 13th November.</p>
 	<p>Meanwhile Mar had been waiting idly at Perth, and
 <persName key="Argyll, John Campbell, 2nd Duke of">Argyll</persName> had got together a fair-sized army at Stirling, while
 the Earl of Sutherland had secured the extreme north for
 the Government.  At last, 10th November, Mar moved
 southward, and on the very day of the disaster at Preston
 the armies met on the <hi rend="italic">Sheriffmuir of Menteith</hi> (near
 Dunblane).  The Highland right, stung to madness by
 the death of Clanranald, charged with such fury that
 the left wing of the enemy was completely routed.
 Meanwhile <persName key="Argyll, John Campbell, 2nd Duke of">Argyll</persName>, with his right wing, had driven the Jacobite
 left across the river Allan, but in the pursuit he abandoned
 his own defeated troops.  Mar's sluggish lack of heart
 saved the Hanoverian army from complete defeat. <persName key="Argyll, John Campbell, 2nd Duke of">Argyll</persName>
 held the field; the Stewarts of Appin, the Camerous of
 Lochiel, and many other Highland clans went home for a
 while. The landing of the Pretender at Peterhead, on 22d
 December, kept the rest together for a short time longer;
but his followers lost all heart when they found that the tall,


<pb id="p.43" n="43"/>





meagre, silent, melancholy prince had neither courage to
lead them nor faith in his own cause. <persName key="Argyll, John Campbell, 2nd Duke of">Argyll</persName> was now
reinforced by 6000 good and faithful Dutch troops, and on 30th
January the prince was compelled to give up Perth, Mar's
old headquarters. On 4th February James and his general
ran away from their followers at Montrose, and went back
to France, where <persName key="St. John, Henry, Viscount of Bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</persName> was made the scapegoat of
his failure. The Highland host melted away amidst the
wilderness of Badenoch and Lochaber.  Many prisoners
had been taken at Preston, and seven noblemen were
condemned as traitors; but of these only Derwentwater and
Kenmure were executed. Nairn, Carnwath, Widdrington
were let off. Nithisdale (through the devotion of his wife)
and Wintoun escaped from prison. <persName key="Forster, Thomas">Forster</persName> and Brigadier
<persName key="Mackintosh, Brigadier">Mackintosh</persName> were also captured and condemned, but managed
to break out of gaol. Twenty-six of less note were hanged.</p>

 knowing that the unpopularity of the Stewarts rather than the
 popularity of the new dynasty had caused the

 election in <date value="1716">1716</date>. They accordingly repealed the <hi rend="italic">Triennial
 Act</hi> of <date value="1694">1694</date>, and passed instead the <hi rend="italic">Septennial Act</hi>, increasing
 the length of Parliament to seven years, which is still
 the law of the land. The sitting Parliament continued
 its own existence under the terms of the new Act. This
 was denounced as highly unconstitutional by the Tories,
 but an Act of Parliament can do what it likes, and
 it would have been foolish to have had a new election
 when the country was so disturbed. The result of the
 Act was to make the House of Commons more
 independent of its constituents, and so render it easier for the
 Whig houses to manage Parliament, and keep power in
 their own hands.</p>

   Personal disputes between the different sections of
 the Whigs kept up some show of party government. And
 before long differences of policy made the quarrels
 of rivals for office look respectable. In <date value="1716">1716</date>
 George went to Hanover, and took <persName key="Stanhope, James">Stanhope</persName>

<date value="1719">1719</date> they repealed the <hi rend="italic">Act against Occasional Conformity</hi>

the High Church ascendency; but, fearful of offending the
Church party, they refused to give more liberty to the Non-

the Test and Corporation Acts. But after <date value="1727">1727</date> an annual
<hi rend="italic">Act of Indemnity</hi>, relieving from all penalties those who
had broken the law, gave the dissenters practical liberty,
while avoiding an outcry. In <date value="1719">1719</date> the Government brought
forward a <hi rend="italic">Peerage Bill</hi>.</p>
  <p><quote rend="blockquote">This provided that only six peerages beyond the existing number of

when an old one became extinct; it also changed the sixteen Scotch
elective peers into twenty-five hereditary peers named by the Crown.</quote></p>

  <p>The object of the Bill was to secure the independence of
the existing peers, and to prevent their being swamped by
lavish creations, such as those of the Tories under Queen
<persName key="Anne">Anne</persName>. It was therefore on the same lines as the Septennial
Act, which aimed at giving greater freedom to the Commons.
Its effect would have been to hand over the Government
of England to a close ring of nobles and great landlords
from which there would have been no escape but revolution.
Fortunately the opposition of <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName> and the Tories ended
in the bill being thrown out in the Commons, after it had
easily passed the House of Lords.</p>
  <p>9. <note place="foot" n="7">The Triple Alliance and Alberoni, <dateRange from="1717" to="1720">1717-20</dateRange>.</note>The foreign policy of the <persName key="Stanhope, James">Stanhope</persName> ministry was fixed
by the <hi rend="italic">Triple Alliance</hi>, to which it owed its origin. This
was a union of England, Holland, and France
to maintain the peace of Europe on the basis of
the Treaty of Utrecht. Spain had got strength
from the wise government of the Italian
adventurer, Cardinal Alberoni, and was now bent upon
winning back its old position in Europe. The personal rivalry
of Philip V., King of Spain, and the Duke of Orleans,
Regent of France for sickly little Louis XV., for the
succession to the French throne had resulted in a coolness
between the two kingdoms which <persName key="Louis XIV.">Louis XIV.</persName> had hoped


<pb id="p.45" n="45"/>



to unite for ever. Alberoni, eager to upset the Treaty of
Utrecht, and to restore the Spanish power in Italy, sought
for allies in the old enemies, Sweden and Russia, both of
which powers were coming to terms, and had interests in
Germany clashing with those of Hanover. War soon broke
out. A Spanish force rapidly conquered <placeName key="Sardinia">Sardinia</placeName> and Sicily
from the Emperor and the new King of Sicily, but the
defeat of the Spanish fleet by Admiral <persName key="Byng, George">Byng</persName> off <hi rend="italic">Cape
Passaro</hi> in <placeName key="Sicily">Sicily</placeName> (11th Aug. <date value="1718">1718</date>) put an end to Alberoni's
Italian plans. An attempt to get up a new Jacobite rising
in Scotland was a complete failure. Up to now Austria
had been quarrelling with the Dutch about the <hi rend="italic">Barrier
Treaty</hi> (by which the fortresses of the Austrian Netherlands
were garrisoned by Dutch troops), but she was frightened
by the danger of her Italian possessions into joining the
Triple Alliance, which thus became the <hi rend="italic">Quadruple Alliance.</hi>
In <date value="1718">1718</date> the death of <persName key="Charles XII.">Charles XII.</persName>, the last great Swedish
king, an ambitious, energetic, and fearless soldier,
destroyed the power of Sweden in Europe, and broke up the
northern combination against England. In <date value="1719">1719</date> Alberoni
fell through a Court intrigue.  Next year peace was
restored. The chief result of the movement was that Sicily
went to Austria in exchange for <placeName key="Sardinia">Sardinia</placeName>. Henceforth the
Duke of Savoy (King of Sicily since the Treaty of Utrecht)
is called King of <placeName key="Sardinia">Sardinia</placeName>.</p>
  <p>10. <note place="foot" n="8">The South Sea Bubble, <date value="1720">1720</date>.</note>The year <date value="1720">1720</date> was marked by a great wave of
speculation and risky ventures in trade.  Peace had restored
public confidence, and people were looking
out for good profits for the money they were
willing to lay out.  At London the South Sea scheme,
and in Paris the Mississippi scheme, started by a scheming
Scotchman named Law, were thought to be the quickest
ways to get rich.  The <hi rend="italic">South Sea Company</hi> had been
formed by <persName key="Harley, Robert">Harley</persName> in <date value="1711">1711</date>, and had been given all the
rights of trade with Spanish America that were allowed
to England by the Treaty of Utrecht. It had been very
successful as a trading company, and its shares were much
sought for. It now tried to widen its business by bribing the
Government to give it the management of the <hi rend="italic">National Debt,</hi>
which had hitherto belonged to the Bank of England. Now
the Government wanted to profit by the peace to lessen the
rate of interest on the debt, as it could get money cheaper
now that peace and the Protestant succession were safe.
So it gladly took the seven and a half millions that the
South Sea Company offered for this privilege. The way the


<pb id="p.46" n="46"/>


<note place="top" n="1">[<date value="1727">1727</date>.</note>

  Company hoped to get its money back was by persuading
  everybody to exchange their Government funds for South
  Sea stock. The inducement held out was the wonderful
  profits to be won by the South Sea trade. The plan was
  successful. People got so eager to buy up South Sea stock
  that its price went up from  &#x00A3;100 to &#x00A3;1000. Side by side
  with this grew up an extraordinary madness for speculation.
  A contemporary ballad thus describes the scramble for
  wealth in 'Change Alley (near St. Paul's) :-
              <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"In London stands a famous pile,</l>
                  <l>And near that pile an alley,</l>

                  <l>And wisdom stoops to folly.</l>
                <l>Here stars and garters do appear,</l>
                  <l>Among our lords the rabble,</l>
                <l>To buy and sell, to see and hear</l>
                  <l>The Jews and Gentiles squabble.</l>
                <l>Here crafty courtiers are too wise</l>
                  <l>For those who trust to fortune;</l>
                <l>They see the cheat with clearer eyes</l>
                  <l>Who peep behind the curtain.</l>

                <l>Not caring what comes after."</l></quote></p>
  <p>Cunning projectors now started silly bubble companies,
such as companies for importing jackasses from Spain, for
a wheel of perpetual motion, for making salt water fresh,
and even <quote>"for an undertaking which should in due time be
revealed."</quote> Foolish people were found to invest their money
in the most foolish of them. But before long the reaction
came. The South Sea Company was so afraid of the effect
of these bubble companies on its own shares that it began
to attack some of them as illegal. This was enough to show
the folly of the whole thing. The bubble companies
collapsed at once. The South Sea shares tumbled down from
&#x00A3;1000 to  &#x00A3; 135, and those who bought them at the high
price found their property shrunk up to one-eighth of its
former amount. Many rogues had made money, and many
honest but silly people had lost all they had. Great distress
followed. The blame was thrown on the Government, and
it was found out that many members of it had made large
sums out of the public ruin. They were fiercely attacked.

lofty and impassioned eloquence and unswerving honesty
had already won him a unique position. Meanwhile <persName key="St. John, Henry, Viscount of Bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</persName>,
the greatest party manager of his day, had been
allowed to return from exile in <date value="1723">1723</date>, and had used his
brilliant literary and social gifts to create a new Tory party,
free from all taint of Jacobitism. Frederick, Prince of
Wales, a shallow, worthless man, was on as bad terms with
his father the king as <persName key="George II.">George II.</persName> himself had been with
<persName key="George I.">George I.</persName>, but with less cause. Round his court at Leicester
House the Opposition gathered, and <persName key="St. John, Henry, Viscount of Bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</persName>'s
celebrated pamphlet <hi rend="italic">On the Idea of a
Patriot King</hi> was written to suggest the benefits
which would result from a really national monarch,
putting himself at the head of his people to crush the noble
faction that had domineered so long over king and people
alike. <persName key="St. John, Henry, Viscount of Bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</persName> also wrote largely for the Craftsman,
the ably conducted weekly organ of the opposition. James
<persName key="Thomson, James">Thomson</persName>, the famous poet of nature, wrote his <hi rend="italic">Rule

But, despite statesmen, pamphleteers, and poets, <persName key="George II.">George</persName>
faithfully stood by his trusty minister, though in <date value="1737">1737</date>
the death of Queen <persName key="Caroline of Anspach">Caroline</persName> lost him a strong and
steady friend. But neither court support nor the arts of
parliamentary management and corruption could keep the
great minister much longer in power.</p>
  <p>4. <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName>'s foreign policy was on the same lines as his
home government. His chief aim was to maintain the
peace of Europe on the basis of the Utrecht settlement.
At first he found his best support in France, where the
crafty but peace-loving Cardinal Fleury was gradually


<pb id="p.51" n="51"/>




creeping into power. <note place="foot" n="6">Foreign policy of <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName>, <dateRange from="1725" to="1738">1725-38</dateRange>.</note>His chief danger always came from
Spain, where the bold and ambitious Elizabeth Farnese of
Parma, the second wife of Philip V., now ruled
her weak husband, and strove to keep up the
policy of Alberoni, and to win principalities
for her own children in Italy. The Emperor <persName key="Charles VI.">Charles VI.</persName>
was still angry with the Maritime Powers, and started in
<date value="1722">1722</date> an Ostend East India Company, threatening their
most lucrative trade. In <date value="1725">1725</date> the Spanish ambassador at
Vienna was the Dutch adventurer Ripperda, <quote>"a projecting,
speculating, enterprising, inconsiderate, hot-headed
fellow, with great views rather than great parts."</quote> He now
concluded the <hi rend="italic">First Treaty of Vienna</hi>, by which Philip
joined his old enemy the emperor in attempting to upset
the treaty of Utrecht, to which both were from very
different motives equally hostile. Ripperda then went back
to Madrid and became Philip's foreign minister.  In <date value="1726">1726</date>
England, France, Prussia, Holland, and some minor
States united in the <hi rend="italic">Treaty of Hanover</hi> to oppose Spain
and Austria. Europe seemed on the verge of a general
war; but Ripperda, like Alberoni, suddenly fell from power
(<date value="1726">1726</date>). <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName> and Fleury both struggled for peace,
and were still more anxious to do so when the far-seeing
and eccentric Frederick William I. of Prussia, who had
married <persName key="George II.">George</persName>'s sister, went over with his well-governed
state and large and carefully-trained army, to the side of
the emperor. In <date value="1727">1727</date> Gibraltar was besieged in a half-
hearted way by the Spaniards, and the English sent a fleet
to blockade Portobello in South America. But preliminaries
were quickly signed.  In <date value="1729">1729</date> England and Spain
made peace by the <hi rend="italic">Treaty of Seville</hi>. In <date value="1731">1731</date> the Second
<hi rend="italic">Treaty of Vienna</hi> ended the troubles which the first treaty
had begun. When, in <date value="1733">1733</date>, the <hi rend="italic">War of the Polish Succession</hi>
broke out in Europe, <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName> steadily refused to take
part in it, though France and Spain were now again united,
and Elizabeth's Italian schemes at last triumphed, now that
her son, Don Carlos, drove the Austrians from Naples, and
established himself as king of that country. The war was
therefore limited to two campaigns, and in <date value="1735">1735</date>
preliminaries of peace were signed, though the Third or <hi rend="italic">Definitive
Peace of Vienna</hi> was not concluded until 7th November
<date value="1738">1738</date>. By it Don Carlos was recognised as King of Naples,
and Austria compensated by Parma and Piacenza, which
rounded off their former possession the Milanese; Duke
Francis of <placeName key="Lorraine">Lorraine</placeName> was made Duke of Tuscany (where the

Stanislas, the exiled king of Poland, who was Louis XV.'s
father-in-law, for his lifetime, after which it was to go to
France.</p>

roused. The alliance of the two Bourbon courts seemed to
threaten the balance of Europe. Meanwhile the
trade jealousies, which play so great a part in
eighteenth century politics, grew. Spain complained
of the English ships, which, despite the
Treaty of Utrecht, carried on a large smuggling trade with
the South American Colonies. English merchants complained
of the harshness of the Spanish custom-houses, of
the tyranny of the Spanish officials, and of the right of search
claimed by them over all ships in South American waters.
A merchant captain named Jenkins went about the country
declaring that his ears had been cut off by the Spaniards,
and showing them in a box wrapped up in cotton wool.
This roused English feeling to fever heat. The Opposition
attacked <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName> for his cowardly contempt of English
interests. Very unwillingly <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName> gave in, and in <date value="1739">1739</date>
war was declared against Spain. In <date value="1739">1739</date> Admiral Vernon,
a noisy member of the opposition, won great applause by
capturing Portobello with only six ships; but in <date value="1741">1741</date> the
same leader, at the head of a vast force, failed hopelessly
in his assault on <placeName key="Carthagena">Carthagena</placeName>, the strongest fortress in
Spanish South America. Yet <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName>'s sluggish conduct
of the war drew some fresh charges upon him. The death
of the emperor, <persName key="Charles VI.">Charles VI.</persName>, on 20th October <date value="1740">1740</date>, made
a general European war certain, and <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName> was further
attacked for neglecting our treaty obligations and
withholding support from the Austrians. At last, in <date value="1741">1741</date>, a
general election went decidedly against him.  Early in
<date value="1742">1742</date> he was beaten in Parliament over the Chippenham
election petition, and forced to resign. His enemies would
have impeached him, and a committee was appointed to
inquire into his government. But he was still powerful
enough to stop this. The king made him Earl of Orford,
and his friends soon came back to power. But his own
career was at an end. He had long suffered from ill-health.
He died in <date value="1745">1745</date>. With all his faults he had given England
peace for twenty years.</p>
   <p>6. The fall of <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName> was followed by no great change
at home. The opposition was made up of men who agreed
in nothing but their dislike of <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName>, and they could


<pb id="p.53" n="53"/>




not form a united ministry. The new ministers were of
course Whigs.  <note place="foot" n="8"><persName key="Carteret, Lord; Earl Granville">Carteret</persName>'s Ministry, <dateRange from="1742" to="1744">1742-44</dateRange>.</note>Lord <persName key="Wilmington, Spencer Compton">Wilmington</persName>, <quote>" the most formal and

Prime Minister. But his incompetence left <persName key="Carteret, Lord; Earl Granville">Carteret</persName>, now
Secretary of State, at the practical head of affairs.
<persName key="Pelham, Thomas, Duke of Newcastle">Newcastle</persName>, <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName>'s greatest ally, was still in office, and Henry
<persName key="Pelham, Henry">Pelham</persName> was Paymaster. Pulteney withdrew from active
work, and took the earldom of Bath and a seat in the Cabinet
without office. <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> and the other young and fiery spirits
of the opposition, like the Tories, were left out in the cold.
As a protest against <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName>'s system, a <hi rend="italic">Place Bill</hi> was
passed to limit the number of offices which could be held
by members of Parliament; but the system of government
was hardly changed.</p>
  <p><persName key="Carteret, Lord; Earl Granville">Carteret</persName> was a remarkable man.  <quote>"Quite plain and
simple in his manner, there was something both commanding
and captivating, more in his countenance and his
general manner than in anything he said."</quote> <quote>"He had a
most comely and engaging person."</quote> Yet his irregular
habits and want of fixed principles prevented him from
winning his proper place among English statesmen. He
had read much and travelled far, and knew more about
foreign affairs than anybody else in England. The king
liked him because he could talk German with him, and
thoroughly sympathised with his foreign policy.  But
<persName key="Carteret, Lord; Earl Granville">Carteret</persName> despised <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName>'s arts of management. <quote>"What
is it to me,"</quote> he said, <quote>"who is judge and who is bishop?
It is my business to make kings and emperors, and to
maintain the balance of Europe."</quote> With such a disposition,
and with thorough dislike of all business habits, he was
soon to be thrust out of power by the Pelhams, who had
inherited the dexterity but not the greatness of <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName>.
But before his fall in <date value="1744">1744</date>, <persName key="Carteret, Lord; Earl Granville">Carteret</persName> (now become Earl
Granville) had brought England into an active share in the
European war.</p>

   succeeded by the decorous and business-like Henry <persName key="Pelham, Henry">Pelham</persName>,
 who had learned from <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName>'s mistakes that
 he must conciliate the whole of the opposition.
 So he formed a <hi rend="italic">Broad Bottom Administration</hi>, which
 included nearly every section of the Whig party, and found
 room for more than one Tory. The king's personal dislike
 to <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> kept him out of place until <date value="1746">1746</date>, when, in the crisis

of the Jacobite revolt, <persName key="George II.">George</persName> was compelled, by the
resignation of his ministers and the failure of <persName key="Carteret, Lord; Earl Granville">Granville</persName> to form
a Cabinet, to admit <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> to office. As Paymaster of the
Forces, his eloquent mouth was stopped, while his presence
made the ministry more popular.   The bold but
unscrupulous Henry <persName key="Fox, Henry">Fox</persName>, <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName>'s rival, became Secretary at
War. The ministry held together as long as <persName key="Pelham, Henry">Pelham</persName> lived.
The second great Whig schism was thus healed as completely
as the first.  A  European war and a  British
rebellion left no time for factious disunion.</p>

defeat of the Austrians at Mollwitz (<date value="1741">1741</date>), showed that another great
general had arisen in Europe. Saxony and Bavaria invaded Bohemia
and Austria. Spain threatened the Milanese. In France an ardent
war party clamoured for Fleury s dismissal, and before long French
auxiliaries appeared in the Bavarian army. The young and

not too regardful of the interests of the Queen of Hungary. Great

soon caught his enthusiasm. The capture of two companies
of regulars sent out from Fort Augustus decided the
question; and on 19th August the Marquis of Tullibardine, who
for his treason in <date value="1715">1715</date> had forfeited the duchy of Atholl to
his younger brother, raised the standard of the Stewarts
in wild and desolate Glenfinnan. Murray of Broughton
hurried up from the south, and became Charles's Secretary
of State. The clans now assembled in large numbers, and
General Cope, the commander-in-chief in Scotland, afraid
to defend the pass of Corry Arrack, retreated northwards
to Inverness. This left the way to the Lowlands open;
and on 4th September <persName key="Pretender, the Young">Charles Edward</persName> marched in triumph
into Perth, where he was joined by James Drummond,
called by his neighbours, despite his father's attainder,
Duke of Perth, and Lord George Murray, another brother
of the Duke of Atholl. The latter proved the ablest officer
on the side of the rebels, but quarrelled fiercely with Perth
and Murray of Broughton.</p>

   <quote rend="blockquote">The campaign was conducted with more spirit than that of <date value="1715">1715</date>.
Anxious to get before Cope, who was making ready to return south by
sea, Charles left Perth on 11th September. On Sunday, 15th
September, the Edinburgh militiamen were hurried out of kirk to join Colonel
Gardiner's dragoons gathered at Corstorphine to defend the capital;
but the citizens shirked fighting, and a disgraceful panic seized the
regulars. The Canter of Coltbrig was followed by the surrender of
Edinburgh, and, though the Castle held out, Charles took up his
quarters in Holyrood, and James VIII. was proclaimed at the Market
Cross amidst the rejoicings of the people, who were Jacobite because
they hated the Union even more than the Highlanders and Papists.

General Hawley, who had superseded Wade, marched from Edinburgh

near Inverness. The English officers had found out
how to meet the Highland rush; fixing bayonets, the

close upon them, when, with a well-aimed volley, they mowed down
the first line, and checked the onslaught which straggled harmlessly
up to their own well-kept ranks, and was broken helplessly upon
their bayonets. <quote>"The Highlanders,"</quote> wrote <persName key="Cumberland, William, Duke of">Cumberland</persName>, <quote>"came three

reverence for the clan chieftains. A disarming Act was sternly
carried out. It was made a crime to wear the Highland kilt
and clan tartan. Schools were established to extend a
knowledge of English. The Jacobite Episcopal clergy were put
under crushing disabilities. Good hard roads were made
through the Highlands. The easy-going Celtic chief, bound
by custom to treat his tenants fairly, gave way to the
Lowland landlord, zealous for progress and improvement,
anxious for a good interest out of his estate, and sometimes
straining the law in his own favour.  The loyal and satisfied
clansman became the distressed and discontented crofter,
little better off than the Irish cottier. The more daring

The interest payable on the national debt was reduced to
three per cent.  Lord Hardwicke, the Chancellor,

But the sluggishness of <persName key="Pelham, Henry">Pelham</persName>'s government, as opposed
as <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName>'s to all great changes, was reflected in the
deadness of the nation to higher things.  Men believed that
religion, enthusiasm, patriotism were dying and rightly
giving way to reason, solid good sense, and general love of
mankind. In particular, the old religious hatreds that had
raged so fiercely when <persName key="Anne">Anne</persName> was on the throne had largely
yielded to the easy common-sense tolerance of the new
generation. The High Church and the Puritan parties
equally lost ground. The bishops were now mostly Low

Broad Churchmen. The country clergy remained High
Church, and quarrelled so fiercely with the bishops in
Convocation that, after <date value="1717">1717</date>, it was not allowed to meet again

  <p>2. <note place="foot" n="2">The Methodist Movement, <dateRange from="1729" to="1739">1729-39</dateRange>.</note>The most emotional and enthusiastic of modern forms
of Protestant religion sprang up in strong reaction to the
general temper ofthis period. About <date value="1729">1729</date>, a few
earnest Oxford men formed a little society which
met to discuss religious questions, and whose
members were remarkable for the holiness and good order
of their lives. They fasted on Wednesdays and Fridays,
received the Communion once a week, and ministered to
the sick, the poor, and the prisoners in Oxford gaol. They
were laughed at by their fellow-students, and nicknamed
<hi rend="italic">Methodists</hi>. Their leader was <hi rend="italic"><persName key="Wesley, John">John Wesley</persName></hi> (<dateRange from="1703" to="1791">1703-1791</dateRange>),
fellow of Lincoln College, a man of extraordinary force of
character, who had learnt from the <hi rend="italic">Serious Call</hi> of the holy
Nonjuror, William Law, a lofty and fervent piety. His
brother, <hi rend="italic">Charles Wesley</hi>, afterwards famous as a hymn-
writer, also joined the movement. They were both High
Churchmen, like their father Samuel, rector of Epworth,
Lincolnshire.  Others of the little group were <hi rend="italic">George
<persName key="Whitefield, George">Whitefield</persName></hi> <dateRange from="1714" to="1770">(1714-1770)</dateRange>, servitor of Pembroke College, the
son of a Gloucester innkeeper, who soon gained
extraordinary influence by his vivid and heart-stirring sermons,
and <hi rend="italic">James Hervey</hi>, author of the <hi rend="italic">Meditations</hi>. They continued
their meetings until <date value="1735">1735</date>, when the Wesleys left
Oxford, and went on a mission to the colony of Georgia,
just established by the warm-hearted General Oglethorpe
as a refuge for debtors. But in <date value="1738">1738</date> <persName key="Wesley, John">Wesley</persName> returned to
England, after altogether failing in his work in America.
He was strangely despondent when he learnt from the
<hi rend="italic">Moravians</hi> (a German sect of gentle enthusiasts) that he
had not yet been converted to a true sense of religion. At
last, in a little room in Aldersgate Street, during a meeting
of the society, <quote>" about a quarter past nine,"</quote> says <persName key="Wesley, John">Wesley</persName>,
<quote>"I felt my heart strangely warmed, I felt I trusted in
Christ alone for salvation, and an assurance that He had
taken away my sins."</quote> Inspired with this belief, <persName key="Wesley, John">Wesley</persName>
and his friends preached with a stronger fervour and an
unwonted zeal.  The congregations groaned or wept,
swayed by intense feeling, or they broke up the services by
violence and riot. The sober and decorous clergy thought
the Methodists mad, and refused to let them preach in
their churches.  In <date value="1739">1739</date>, therefore, the Methodists first
built chapels of their own, though they declared that they
were not dissenters, but anxious only to labour in the

ground left untilled by the Church.  In the same year
<persName key="Whitefield, George">Whitefield</persName> began to preach in the fields to the half-savage
colliers of Kingswood, near Bristol. Tears ran down the
blackened cheeks of his rude hearers as he spoke with
intense pathos of death, sin, repentance, and the wrath to
come. <persName key="Wesley, John">Wesley</persName>, who had <quote>"thought the saving of souls
almost a sin if it had not been done in a church,"</quote> was
driven into following <persName key="Whitefield, George">Whitefield</persName>'s example. For the rest of
their lives the two great preachers wandered ceaselessly
over the land; wherever they went they excited a storm of
opposition or of enthusiasm. Often they were in danger of
their lives, hooted at, pelted, maltreated by brutal mobs,
and left to protect themselves by weak and bigoted
magistrates. They were denounced as Papists, as hypocrites, as
impostors.  The wild excitement following from  their
preaching often produced the maddest extravagances.
But they roused many thousands to lead new lives, and to
shake off sluggish indifference or brutal vice. They stamped
a profound impression upon English character which has
not yet been effaced.</p>

now won for themselves political independence. After <date value="1702">1702</date>
the Whig <hi rend="italic">New East India Company</hi> joined the Tory <hi rend="italic">Old

Madras, and in the isles of Bourbon and France (Mauritius).
But Francois Joseph Dupleix, the brilliant and far-seeing
Governor of Pondicherri (since <date value="1741">1741</date>), was the first European
to perceive that, in the anarchy springing from the break
up of the Mogul Empire, Europeans might hope for

good as European soldiers, and easily defeat the huge
but untrained hosts of the native princes, and with Indian
arms and Indian gold make the vast continent subject
to a small and distant European state. For India is
a continent, not a nation. Its inhabitants are of many
grades of civilisation, many religions, races, and tongues.
No cohesion or unity was possible in such a vast mass

came next. With its planter aristocracy, sprung from good
English families, its population of slaves, and its Church of

England, whose inhabitants were yeomen farmers and small
traders, with few inequalities of wealth or rank. It was,

Louisbourg, a great fortress.  Acadie, now  called Nova

established purely by the state. But the English and French
were still quarrelling about the boundaries of the ceded

were or were not given up to England. There was another
French settlement called <placeName key="Louisiana">Louisiana</placeName>, of which <placeName key="New Orleans">New Orleans</placeName>,
named after the Regent Philip, was the capital. It stretched
up the Mississippi valley, and threatened to shut the English

thinly inhabited, and badly governed; but the fur dealers
and Indian traders were hardy, energetic, and daring; and,
as in the East, the governors planned great schemes for
extending the power of France. The French now took nearly
all the Red Indians into their pay, drove the English
traders over the Alleghanies, and set up a series of forts

overshadowed by the outbreak of a great European war. A
formidable coalition was formed, which, though
mostly turned against Prussia, was also partly
aimed at England. After the treaty of <date value="1748">1748</date>, European affairs
took a new turn. Austria was so disgusted with England and
Holland for making her give up Silesia and a large part of
the Milanese, and for their old policy of putting down the
trade of the Netherlands, that, by a bold stroke of Kaunitz,
her minister, Maria Theresa established a close alliance
with the French, hoping thus to ruin Prussia, or at least
get back Silesia. Russia, under the Empress Elizabeth,
joined them. Sweden followed her example. The weak
and dilettante Augustus, Elector of Saxony, who was also
King of Poland, was, with many of the smaller states of
Germany, also won over.     Prussia was thus forced to
struggle for its very existence; but <persName key="Frederick II.">Frederick</persName> the Great
showed wonderful coolness, presence of mind, and energy
in the face of danger. The old jealousies with his uncle
George now seemed to vanish. In great alarm England

changes. In <date value="1760">1760</date> England was not very different
from the England of the Revolution. In <date value="1820">1820</date> modern
England had been practically built up.</p>
  <p>In politics <persName key="George III.">George III.</persName> upset for a time the constitution of
conventions on which the power of the Whig aristocracy was
based. But in the struggle he lost the American colonies
and the great position in Europe which Chatham had won for
England. Yet he succeeded in the end, because he got the
people on his side. His triumph marks the faint beginnings
of the movement which was in the end to bring the people
into power.</p>
  <p>England's vigour and energy soon won her European
influence back, and laid the foundations of a new commercial

on almost without a break.</p>
  <p>A great <hi rend="italic">Industrial Revolution</hi> was now making England,
hitherto almost altogether a trading and farming country,
the workshop of the world. A long series of inventions
made the Factory System possible. The results were an
increasing population, wealth more quickly and easily won,
more progress in material civilisation, and the shifting of
the real centre of the country from the south to the north.
But great dangers also came in. There were more glaring
contrasts of riches and poverty, of luxury and want. The
factory hand lived a wretched life in the unhealthy workshop
and the stifling town. The new manufacturers looked with
bitter jealousy on the old aristocracy. But a new zeal for
religion, and a new zeal for humanity, led many good, unselfish

men to do their best to make the new state of things
bearable.</p>
  <p>While all this was going on, the eighteenth century
system began to break up. The ideas on which it was
founded had been already attacked by Voltaire and
<persName key="Rousseau, Jean Jacques">Rousseau</persName>, and its political conventions rudely assailed by
<persName key="Frederick II.">Frederick</persName> of Prussia. The <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> completes
its wreck.</p>
  <p>England weathered the storm better than any other
country, though her institutions were sorely tried, and
though she had a special danger in distressed and
discontented Ireland, now bound more closely to Britain by the
Union.</p>
  <p>Revolution soon brought about <hi rend="italic">Reaction</hi>.
<persName key="Napolean I.">Napoleon Buonaparte</persName> professed to carry out the work of the Revolution,
while really promoting the reaction. But he strove
only for himself, and sought to set up a new universal
monarchy. England saved Europe from <persName key="Napoleon I.">Napoleon</persName>, and
upheld the doctrine of nationality, from which so much good
was soon to come.</p>
   <p>After <persName key="Napoleon I.">Napoleon</persName>'s fall the restored priests and despots of
 the <hi rend="italic">Holy Alliance</hi> tried to undo what was good in the
 Revolution, on the pretence of getting rid of the bad, and
 waged war against <hi rend="italic">nations</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Liberal principles</hi>. England
 now suffered more from the Reaction than from the Revolution,
 but she never quite sided with the restored kings of
 the Continent. But disgust of the long Tory rule now led
 to a further popular movement, beginning as soon as the
 war was over. However, before the reaction was completed

He lived simply and frugally, amusing himself with farming.
He married in <date value="1761">1761</date> Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who
was, says <persName key="Walpole, Horace">Horace Walpole</persName>,<quote> "not tall nor a beauty; pale
and very thin, but sensible-looking and genteel."</quote> With his
narrow intellect <persName key="George III.">George</persName> possessed a strong will, a high
courage and a vigorous character. He was thoroughly
obstinate, and there was no way of getting over his
prejudices. <note place="foot" n="1">His political objects.</note>He boasted that he was <quote>"born and bred a Briton,"</quote>
and he had been taught by his mother <quote>"to be a
king."</quote> He chose as his chief adviser John
Stuart, Earl of <persName key="Bute, John Stuart, Earl of">Bute</persName>, a rich Scotch nobleman of culture
and refinement, but inexperienced in politics and too fond
of intrigue. <persName key="Bute, John Stuart, Earl of">Bute</persName> was a new Tory of the school of
<persName key="St. John, Henry, Viscount of Bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</persName>, and taught <persName key="George III.">George</persName> to take for his model
<persName key="St. John, Henry, Viscount of Bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</persName>'s Patriot King, <quote>"the enemy of all corruption, the most
powerful of all reformers, the admiration of every honest
man."</quote> The patriot king was <quote>"to begin to govern as soon
as he begins to reign, purge his Court, and call into the
administration such as will serve him on his principles.</quote>"
He must <quote>"espouse no party, for party government must
always end in the government of a faction."</quote> He was to
exercise freely and fully all those powers which the law still
gave him, but which the custom of the last two reigns had
taken away. Above all, he was to choose his own ministers.
He was to accept <quote>" Revolution principles,"</quote> and never break
the strict law. But his great object was to overthrow the
constitutional usages which had made the king a sort of
Venetian doge.  He was to extend his connections and
enlarge his influence in every way in his power. This great
object <persName key="George III.">George</persName> pursued continuously and persistently for
nearly fifty years. He did not flinch under a storm of
unpopularity, and in the long run won the day. People
respected him because his life was pure, and because he
was such a thorough Englishman. His prejudices were,
after all, their prejudices. His ends were honest, but he was
as corrupt as <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName> in the means he took to gain them,
and, though he spent little on himself, he got rid of so much
money in bribery that he was constantly in debt, though
his <quote>"<hi rend="italic">civil list</hi>"</quote> was a liberal one. He meant to break
down the organised ring of noble Whig houses that had
ruled England for the last two reigns. His great advantages


<pb id="p.75" n="75"/>




were their unpopularity with the people, their factious
quarrels among themselves, and the corrupt and
irresponsible character of the House of Commons. His chief
dependants soon began to act together independently of
party politics, and the secret influence of the <quote>"<hi rend="italic">king's friends</hi>"</quote>
was soon complained of. The new Tories, whom <persName key="St. John, Henry, Viscount of Bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</persName>
had taught, looked up to him as they had looked up
to his father <persName key="Frederick II.">Frederick</persName>. Even Jacobites attended his
Court. Before long the Whig influence began to wane.
It would have fallen much sooner, only <persName key="George III.">George</persName> could not
see the strong likeness between his ideas and those of <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName>.
He even confounded <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> with the Whig noblemen, and hated
him the more because he was powerful and beloved. This,
along with the unpopularity of his mother and his Scotch
adviser, made him much disliked at first. But when
experience showed his slow mind the right way to go to work he
succeeded wonderfully. Step by step he brought back the
Tories to power, and from <date value="1770">1770</date> to <date value="1830">1830</date> the Tory rule was
only broken up by short ministries in <dateRange from="1782" to="1784">1782-4</dateRange>, and in <dateRange from="1806" to="1807">1806-7</dateRange>,
which <persName key="George III.">George</persName> accepted unwillingly and turned out as soon
as he could. Yet <persName key="George III.">George</persName> was no mere Tory king, as his
predecessors had been Whig kings. He aimed at being
above parties, and only used the Tories because their ideas
fell in most nearly with his.  In the end he chose what
ministers he would. The royal power again became a
reality. And he grew more popular as he succeeded better.</p>

<persName key="Pelham, Thomas, Duke of Newcastle">Newcastle</persName>, he quarrelled with his people as completely as

his Cabinet, and by rousing <persName key="Pelham, Thomas, Duke of Newcastle">Newcastle</persName>'s jealousy against
the <quote>"great Commoner."</quote> He also strove for peace, as that
would diminish <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName>'s glory, and give more leisure to carry
out the new policy. But France had now won a new ally
in Spain, where in <date value="1759">1759</date> Don Carlos of Naples, the old foe
of the English, had become King Charles I I I., in succession
to his half-brother, the peace-making <persName key="Ferdinand VI.">Ferdinand VI.</persName>, and
had formed a <hi rend="italic">Family Compact</hi> (August <date value="1761">1761</date>) with France,

America without awakening any opposition.<note place="foot" n="2">American Taxation, <dateRange from="1765" to="1773">1765-73</dateRange>.</note>
With no wish to lessen American liberty, <persName key="Grenville, George">Grenville</persName> passed
in <date value="1765">1765</date> a <hi rend="italic">Stamp Act</hi>, which required all deeds, newspapers,

to keep the proposed army. But the Americans refused
to use the stamped paper, and declared that as taxation
and representation went together, the English Parliament,
in which they had no part, had no right to tax
them, especially an inland tax of the kind proposed.
Such was the outcry, that in <date value="1766">1766</date> Rockingham repealed
the Act; though he passed another law declaring that
Parliament had a right to make laws binding British
colonies in all cases whatsoever. This was done by the
advice of <persName key="Burke, Edmund">Burke</persName>, while Pitt, who <quote>"rejoiced that America

took advantage of his chief's illness to put some
new duties on glass, red and white lead, colours, paper, and
tea imported into America. Americans had hitherto admitted
the right of England to impose laws regulating their
external trade and enforcing duties, but now they were very
angry at this silly attempt to revive the policy of the Stamp
Act. They maintained that, like Scotland before <date value="1707">1707</date>,
America owed allegiance to the English Crown alone, and
not to the English Parliament at all. A passive resistance
made the new taxes of no effect. English soldiers and the
Royalists who took the English side were scouted and
insulted. In <date value="1770">1770</date> a fight between some soldiers and the
Boston mob resulted in a trifling disturbance, denounced as
the <quote>"bloody massacre,"</quote> and the <quote>"foundation of American
independence."</quote> In <date value="1773">1773</date> <persName key="North, Lord">North</persName> repealed all <persName key="Townshend, Charles">Townshend</persName>'s
duties except that on tea, and, to help the India Company
(then in great financial distress), allowed it to send out tea
from England to America, without charging the high English
duty, and subject only to this American duty of 3d. a pound.
But the Americans would not be bribed by cheap tea to
acknowledge the doctrine of the Act of <date value="1766">1766</date>. Men disguised
as Red Indians boarded the tea-ships in Boston harbour and
threw their cargoes overboard (16th <date value="1773-12-16">Dec. 1773</date>). Meanwhile
the Solicitor-General, the time-serving and astute
Wedderburn, grossly insulted Dr. <persName key="Franklin, Benjamin">Franklin</persName>, the famous writer and
man of science, who was agent in London for Pennsylvania
and Massachusetts. Parliament was angry with Boston,
and passed laws removing its trade to Salem, making
the government of Massachusetts dependent on the Crown,
and allowing American rioters to be tried in England,
  where juries would convict them. At the same time the

   <p>2. <note place="foot" n="3">The Declaration of Independence, <date value="1776">1776</date>.</note>A Congress of twelve colonies met at Philadelphia and
 made ready for armed resistance. At home Parliament
 rejected Chatham and <persName key="Burke, Edmund">Burke</persName>'s projects for conciliation,
 and when Lord <persName key="North, Lord">North</persName> himself (Feb. 20,
 <date value="1775">1775</date>) carried a proposal that colonies which
 made a grant towards the expenses of the empire should be
 freed from all imperial taxation, the concession was too
 small, and came too late. On <date value="1775-04-19">19th April 1775</date> the colonial
 volunteers attacked at Lexington a body of English troops
 on their way back to Boston after destroying some
 magazines of stores at <placeName key="Concord, Mass.">Concord</placeName>. Boston was now blockaded by
 a force of armed colonists, and on 17th June General Gage
 marched to dislodge them from their position on Breed's
 Hill and Bunker's Hill, which overlooked Boston town.
 Twice the gallant volunteers thrust back the regular troops
 as they climbed up the steep slopes of Breed's Hill. But
 the third time the Americans gave way, and the <hi rend="italic">battle of
 Bunker's Hill</hi> made peace for a time hopeless. Another
 Congress at Philadelphia made everything ready for fighting,
 and appointed Colonel George Washington of Virginia
 general of the American army. In <date value="1776">1776</date> a pamphlet called
 <quote>"<hi rend="italic">Common Sense</hi>,"</quote> by the sturdy revolutionist, Tom <persName key="Paine, Thomas">Paine</persName>,
 appeared at Philadelphia, and urged America to free itself
 from <quote>"the barbarous and hellish power which hath stirred
 up the Indians and negroes to destroy us."</quote> In March
 Washington seized on Dorchester Heights, which
 commanded Boston, and forced the English army to withdraw
 to Halifax. The enlistment of German hired troops to get
 over the difficulty of recruiting English soldiers still further
 disgusted the Americans. At last, on <date value="1776-07-04">4th July 1776</date>, the
 Congress issued the famous Declaration of Independence of
 the United States of America, which resolved-
 <quote rend="blockquote">"That these united colonies are and ought to be free and independent
 states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown;
 and that all political connection between them and the State of Great
 Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved."</quote></p>

 <p>3. <note place="foot" n="4">The American War, <dateRange from="1775" to="82">1775-82</dateRange>.</note>From the soldiers' point of view, the war of American
 Independence, so pregnant with great political results, was
 of very little importance. The armies on both
 sides were small, half-hearted, and badly led.
 In England opinion was violently divided, and though the
mass of the people agreed with King <persName key="George III.">George</persName> that America


<pb id="p.85" n="85"/>


must be conquered, king and people alike knew little
how hard a task they had before them, and could not
pick out the right men as generals as Pitt would have
done. The Americans were similarly divided: there was,
especially in the south, a large loyalist minority; and
though there was much violent talk and some vigorous
action among the leaders, the yeomen of New England and
the Quakers and Germans of Pennsylvania hated fighting,
and only wanted to carry on their business in peace.
Washington, a great man, of a sober and judicious sort,
was disgusted with his soldiers. <quote>" Such a dearth of public
spirit, and such want of virtue, such stock-jobbing and
fertility in low arts, I never saw before,"</quote> says he in <date value="1775">1775</date>.
But every advantage was on the side of the colonists. The
vast distances, the impossibility of forcing on an attack,
the incompetence of the English commanders, and the
smallness of the English armies, all secured the Americans'
success. Yet at first the colonists were hard put to it. Sir
William Howe landed in Long Island, and won the Battle
of Brooklyn (Aug. <date value="1776">1776</date>), the first fought on the open field.
Washington withdrew his troops from New York, which now
became the English headquarters. But Howe, unlike his
dead brother, Pitt's favourite, was a poor general. Though
in <date value="1777">1777</date> he won two battles at <hi rend="italic">Brandywine Creek</hi> and<hi rend="italic"> Germantown,</hi>
overran New Jersey, and occupied Philadelphia,
the seat of the Congress, he left Washington unassailed in
his winter quarters at Valley Forge, though the <hi rend="italic">continental</hi>
(i.e. the colonial) army was reduced to a half-starved,
shoeless remnant of a few thousand men. Howe failed, also, to
work well with General Burgoyne, more successful as a
writer of plays, and a man about town, than as a general,
who had marched from Canada down the Hudson Valley,
but was obliged to surrender in October <date value="1777">1777</date> with over
5000 men to the American General Gates at <hi rend="italic">Saratoga</hi>.</p>
   <p>4. <note place="foot" n="5">War with France, Spain, and Holland, <dateRange from="1778" to="1780">1778-80</dateRange>.</note>The capitulation of Burgoyne at Saratoga decided the
 war. France, long waiting a chance to pay off old
 scores against England, now acknowledged the
 independence of America (<date value="1778">1778</date>). Many volunteers,
 including the young Marquis of Lafayette,
 afterwards so famous in the history of the French
 Revolution, and Kosciusko, the Polish hero, joined the Americans.
 Arms, supplies, troops, and officers were sent over.  Open
 war now broke out between France and England. Now
 that it was too late, Lord <persName key="North, Lord">North</persName> was allowed to carry
 through Parliament proposals for conciliation such as

<persName key="Burke, Edmund">Burke</persName> had previously urged in vain; but the Americans
were now bent on nothing less than freedom from England
altogether.  In <date value="1779">1779</date> Spain joined France and blockaded
Gibraltar. In <date value="1780">1780</date> our old ally, Holland, joined England's
enemies, while the northern powers, headed by <persName key="Catharine II.">Catharine</persName>
of Russia and <persName key="Frederick II.">Frederick</persName> the Great, who still hated the
House of Hanover, formed an Armed Neutrality to protect
the trading-ships of neutral powers from the English
claim to search for and seize enemies' goods. <hi rend="italic">The Gordon Riots, <date value="1780">1780</date>.</hi>Meanwhile
the attempts of <persName key="North, Lord">North</persName> to help the English Roman Catholics
led to terrible riots in London (June <date value="1780">1780</date>),
when the mob, led by the half-mad Lord George
Gordon, burnt Catholic chapels, opened the prisons,
plundered the town, and frightened the ministry. <note place="foot" n="6">Ireland, <dateRange from="1778" to="1782">1778-82</dateRange>. </note>In <date value="1778">1778</date>
bands of volunteers, formed to protect Ireland
from invasion, imitated the acts of the
Americans, and destroyed English ascendency.</p>
  <p>An able and energetic American captain, Paul Jones,
plundered the British coasts. A doubtful battle with the
French fleet off Ushant led to a political squabble between
the Whig admiral, Keppel, and his Tory second in
command, Palliser. English colonies, and especially West
India Islands, fell one after the other into the enemies'
hands. In India, Haidar Ali, Sultan of Mysore, was laying
waste the English settlements on the Karnatik up to the
walls of Madras.</p>
  <p>5. <note place="foot" n="7">Death of Chatham, <date value="1778">1778</date>, and loss of America, <date value="1781">1781</date>.</note>Many thought that the greatness of England had passed
 away, and the Whig opposition openly rejoiced
at the failures of the king and the Tories; but
this conduct made them <quote>"not only patriots out
of place, but patriots out of the opinion of the
public,"</quote> and considerably strengthened the king's hands.
In his worst difficulties <persName key="George III.">George</persName> never lost heart. <quote>"There
shall, at all events,"</quote> said he, in the crisis of the Gordon
riots, <quote>"be one magistrate of the kingdom who will do his
duty."</quote> Yet he refused to give Chatham the chance to save
England once more.    <quote>"I solemnly declare,"</quote> wrote he,
<quote>"that nothing shall bring me personally to treat with Lord
Chatham."</quote> He would allow <persName key="North, Lord">North</persName> to offer him a place in
the existing ministry, but that was of course impossible.
But in April <date value="1778">1778</date> Chatham's eloquent voice was heard for
the last time in the House of Lords, protesting with
faltering though spirited accents <quote>"against the dismemberment
of this ancient and most noble monarchy."</quote> He fell back
in a fit when his speech was over, and died on 11th


<pb id="p.87" n="87"/>



May. With him expired the last faint hope of regaining
America.</p>
  <p>The American war was now carried on more vigorously
than in its earlier stages, and the difficulty of keeping
together the <hi rend="italic">continental</hi> troops and of paying them  in
Government bank notes that were worth much less than
their nominal value, because they could not be exchanged
for gold or silver, drove Washington well-nigh to despair.
<quote>"The combined fleets of France and Spain,"</quote> he wrote,
<quote>"were greatly superior to those of the enemy:
nevertheless the enemy sustained no material damage, and at the
close of the campaign gave a very important blow to our
allies."</quote> Though in <date value="1778">1778</date> Clinton, Howe's successor, was
forced to leave Philadelphia, the loyalist colony of Georgia
became the basis for the conquest of Charleston and South
Carolina in <date value="1780">1780</date>. Two American generals, Benedict Arnold
and Lee, deserted to the English. But the English failed
in their invasion of North Carolina, and in <date value="1781">1781</date> the main
fighting was in Virginia, where, after some successes, Lord
<persName key="Cornwallis, Charles">Cornwallis</persName>, who, alone of the English generals, formed
great plans (which he had not strength to carry out) for
offensive war against the Americans, was hemmed in by
superior forces at <hi rend="italic">York Town</hi> and, on 17th October, forced,
like Burgoyne, to surrender with all his army. This really
ended the war, though Charleston held out against the
Americans for some time, and New York was only given
up at the peace. The independence of the thirteen United
States was secured, and a great migration of persecuted
loyalists to Canada and Nova Scotia completed and assured
the final fall of English influence.</p>
  <p>6. Elsewhere, however, England showed that her vigour
was not yet abated. The energy of Warren <persName key="Hastings, Warren">Hastings</persName>, the
first and greatest Governor-general, and the military skill of
the veteran, Sir Eyre <persName key="Coote, Eyre">Coote</persName>, led to the complete defeat of
Haidar Ali in <date value="1781">1781</date> at <hi rend="italic">Porto Novo</hi>. In the West Indies the
French had taken every English island except Antigua,
<placeName key="Barbados">Barbados</placeName>, and Jamaica, and were planning a great expedition
against the latter island. But in April <date value="1782">1782</date> Rodney won
a great victory over De Grasse, near <hi rend="italic">Dominica</hi>, in which he
succeeded in the manoeuvre of breaking the French line.
This saved Jamaica from the projected attack. In September
<date value="1782">1782</date> the last great effort to get back Gibraltar was made
by the Spaniards, and resisted by General Eliott. The ten
battering ships which were believed to be proof against the

the fortress. Next month Admiral Howe, brother of the
two generals, relieved the garrison; but the blockade,
begun in <date value="1779">1779</date>, was only raised when the peace was signed.</p>
   <p>7. <note place="foot" n="8">The Second Rockingham Ministry, <date value="1782">1782</date>.</note>Lord <persName key="North, Lord">North</persName> had long wished to resign, and only kept

 were gradually dwindling away he suddenly
 threw up office in March <date value="1782">1782</date>. <persName key="George III.">George</persName>
 seriously thought of giving up the crown rather than receive a
 Whig ministry, but at last he reluctantly took Rockingham
 as First Lord of the Treasury, and <persName key="Fox, Charles James">Fox</persName> as Secretary of
 State. The influence of the Whig houses was checked by the
 accomplished but bad-tempered and intriguing Shelburne,
 <persName key="Carteret, Lord; Earl Granville">Carteret</persName>'s son-in-law, the leader of the Chathamites,
 accepting the other secretaryship, and the coarse and brutal
 Thurlow, the most important of the <quote>"king's friends,"</quote> remaining
 Chancellor. <persName key="Burke, Edmund">Burke</persName> was only made Paymaster of the Forces,
 and did not get even a seat in the Cabinet. But his violence
 and want of tact, together with the gang of doubtful Irish
 friends by whom he was always surrounded, rather than
 his poverty and humble origin, were the real causes of this.
 He was intrusted, however, with the great plan of
 Economical Reform, though it was made much less sweeping
 than he wished in order to satisfy the king.</p>

 of Rockingham's government. By yielding legislative
independence to Ireland (<date value="1782">1782</date>) it quieted for a time the imitators
of America among the Irish Protestants. Its greatest task
was to enter into negotiations for peace.
Before, however, these were ended, a violent
quarrel broke out between <persName key="Fox, Charles James">Fox</persName> and Shelburne,
and when on Rockingham's death the king
made Shelburne First Lord of the Treasury,
<persName key="Fox, Charles James">Fox</persName> and his followers went out of office in July <date value="1782">1782</date>, leaving

  <p>Shelburne now ended the peace negotiations by the

<quote rend="blockquote">(a) England recognised as the basis of negotiations the independence

  <p>An extraordinary struggle occupied the spring session of

Whigs threatened to stop supplies; but the young minister
haughtily declared that so long as he kept the king's
confidence he would neither resign nor dissolve Parliament.
Soon popular enthusiasm for the son of Chatham began to
flow, and, combined with the influence of the Crown, was
strong enough to win the battle. The Tories now began to
desert <persName key="North, Lord">North</persName> for <persName key="George III.">George</persName>, and <persName key="Wilkes, John">Wilkes</persName> himself was hot against
the Coalition. On 25th March Parliament was dissolved,
and the new elections gave king and minister a solid and
triumphant majority. It was the greatest victory <persName key="George III.">George</persName> had
ever won.  It was also the greatest victory of the people.
<persName key="George III.">George</persName> had learnt from the son what he would never learn
from the father.  Pitt had united king and people in
opposition to greedy and selfish factions. The principles
of Chatham and <persName key="St. John, Henry, Viscount of Bolingbroke">Bolingbroke</persName> were at last realised together.</p>

tall, thin, stiff in his manner, dignified, sickly in health, shy,


<pb id="p.91" n="91"/>



and proud, though among his few intimates he was gay,
easy-tempered, witty, and affectionate. <note place="foot" n="12">Pitt's character and early government,<dateRange from="1783" to="1789">1783-89</dateRange>.</note>He had been taught
oratory by his father, and had studied hard at
Cambridge. Without Chatham's fire and passion,
he yet had a <quote>"premature and unnatural
dexterity in the combination of words,"</quote> was a
ready debater, and a fluent and impressive rhetorician. With
but little of his father's genius, he had the tact and business
knowledge which Chatham had lacked. <persName key="Burke, Edmund">Burke</persName> called him
<quote>"the sublime of mediocrity,"</quote> and the phrase expresses a
truth, though not the whole truth. As a statesman, he was
hopeful, stimulating, and steadfast.  Though so closely
bound up with the king, he was too powerful and too
hard-working to become his dependant like <persName key="North, Lord">North</persName>. He still
looked to the people for support, and though he led the
Tory party, still called himself a Whig among his friends.
He believed in parliamentary reform and the relief of the
Catholics, and he was in favour of a generous attitude
to Ireland. He found, however, that the king and his party
were against him, and he was rather too ready to rest
contented with making his views known, without taking
vigorous steps to carry them into effect.  Under him
bribery ceased, though he was a lavish creator of peers,
and thought that all very rich men ought to sit in the
House of Lords. He was a great financier. He had read
and digested <persName key="Smith, Adam">Adam Smith</persName>'s <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations</hi>, and
believed in his doctrines of <hi rend="italic">free trade</hi> and colonial policy.
His budget speeches were much admired. In <date value="1786">1786</date> he
carried a plan for a <hi rend="italic">Sinking Fund</hi>, by which he proposed
to set aside a part of the national revenue every year to be
invested and applied with its interest towards the reduction
of the national debt. In the same year he made a famous
  <hi rend="italic">Commercial Treaty</hi> with France, which went a long way
  towards free trade between the old enemies.  He carried
  an <hi rend="italic">India Bill</hi> (<date value="1784">1784</date>), which, though not so broad as <persName key="Fox, Charles James">Fox</persName>'s,
  brought about nearly the same end by establishing a new
  government department called the <hi rend="italic">Board of Control,</hi>
  under a President who was a member of the ministry,
  to supervise the political policy of the Company. When,
  in <date value="1787">1787</date>, the opposition impeached the great and

  <p>Pitt was very careful in his foreign policy, and strove
successfully to win back the friends England had lost
during the American war. He formed a close alliance with
Prussia, Holland, and other northern powers, and was the
first English statesman to look with jealousy on the rise of
Russia, where the great Empress <persName key="Catharine II.">Catharine</persName> II. had formed
a close alliance with the philosophic reformer Joseph II. of
Austria, the son and successor of Maria Theresa, and had

a right to act as Regent. Pitt rightly maintained that in
Parliament alone lay the appointment of a Regent and the
definition of his powers. He was ready to make the prince
regent with certain limitations to his power by Act of
Parliament. But under the mild and gentle treatment of
Dr. Willis, the king soon got well again, and, approving
Pitt's behaviour, he said that <quote>"they were united for the
rest of his life, and that nothing but death should separate

  <p>1. <note place="foot" n="1">English trade before <date value="1760">1760</date>.</note>Up to about <date value="1760">1760</date> England remained mainly a nation of
farmers and merchants. Save that of wool, its manufactures
were of no great importance. Rough goods
for home use were largely made, but most fine
and finished articles were imported from France or
Holland. During the first half of the 18th century England
won the trading supremacy over the world. The <hi rend="italic">carrying
trade</hi>, which, before the Revolution, had been in the hands
of the Dutch, had now passed to the English. Every war
was waged for commercial advantages.   Every peace
brought fresh gains to trade. The <hi rend="italic">Methuen Treaty</hi> with
Portugal (<date value="1703">1703</date>) had opened the Portuguese markets to our


<pb id="p.94" n="94"/>


woollen goods on condition of our taking Portuguese wines
at a third less duty than French. This was looked upon
as that <quote>"glorious treaty by which England gains a million
a year,"</quote> because the Portuguese had nothing to pay for our
English goods except gold and silver, and in those days the
trade which brought most gold and silver into a country
was looked upon as by far the most beneficial. The <hi rend="italic">Asiento</hi>
(which gave England the sole right of supplying the Spanish
colonies with negro slaves), and the commercial clauses of
the <hi rend="italic">Treaty of Utrecht</hi> gave a fresh start to English trade.
Bristol merchants grew rich on the slave-trade, which was
so profitable that no one thought of its wickedness. The
growth of the East India Company's territories, the
conquest of the French colonies and the spread of our own,
all gave fresh openings to the British merchant. Traders
got richer, had more influence in Parliament, and founded
county families. London grew fast, <placeName key="Liverpool">Liverpool</placeName>, and (after
the Union) Glasgow began to rival Bristol in the American
trade. But it was not by peace and free trade, but by
successful war and monopoly that England won its great
foreign trade. Yet having once got it, she managed to beat
all possible competitors; and, even after losing the
American colonies, the volume of her trade with them increased,
in accordance with <persName key="Smith, Adam">Adam Smith</persName>'s principle, but to
everybody else's surprise.</p>
  <p>Manufacturing industry also grew steadily during the
first half of the eighteenth century; but it was on the
old lines and with the old tools. There was little elaborate
machinery, little concentration of labour into factories,
limited division of labour, and miserable means of
communication. Yet between <date value="1700">1700</date> and <date value="1750">1750</date> the population of
<placeName key="Lancashire">Lancashire</placeName>, where the cotton trade was beginning to be
important, grew from about 160,000 to nearly 300,000, and
that of the West Riding of Yorkshire from 230,000 to 360,000,
while the whole population of England was only five
millions in <date value="1700">1700</date> and six millions in <date value="1750">1750</date>.</p>
  <p>2. <note place="foot" n="2">The Industrial Revolution.</note>About <date value="1760">1760</date> a series of discoveries multiplied the power
of production. Four great inventions made the cotton trade,
hitherto one of the smallest of our industries, a
rival with the woollen trade itself. Up to <date value="1760">1760</date>
the machines used were as simple as those of India, and no
whole cotton goods were made; all had a linen warp as
well as a cotton weft. In <date value="1769">1769</date> the shrewd and sanguine
<persName key="Arkwright, Richard">Richard Arkwright</persName>, a Bolton barber, invented the system of
spinning by rollers, which led to his water-frame. In <date value="1770">1770</date>


<pb id="p.95" n="95"/>


James <persName key="Hargreaves, James">Hargreaves</persName>, a Blackburn weaver, patented his
<hi rend="italic">spinning jenny</hi>, which enabled one person to spin several
threads at once. In <date value="1779">1779</date> the proud and sensitive Samuel
Crompton introduced his <hi rend="italic">mule</hi>, which combined the
principles of <persName key="Hargreaves, James">Hargreaves</persName>' and <persName key="Arkwright, Richard">Arkwright</persName>'s inventions.
Meanwhile Strutt's improvements on his <hi rend="italic">stocking-frame</hi> gave a
further start to the hosiery trade of Nottingham. The
cautious and far-seeing James <persName key="Watt, James">Watt</persName>, mathematical
instrument maker at Glasgow, now effected such improvements
in the <hi rend="italic">steam-engine</hi> (<date value="1769">1769</date>), which had hitherto only been
used in Newcomen's more clumsy form, that it became the
chief agent in revolutionising the old state of trade and
labour, and ultimately of society. In <date value="1785">1785</date> steam was first
used in the cotton trade, and in the same year Dr. Edmund
Cartwright, a portly and dignified Yorkshire clergyman,
patented his <hi rend="italic">power-loom</hi>, though it did not come into
general use till the present century. The south-eastern
towns of <placeName key="Lancashire">Lancashire</placeName> (<placeName key="Manchester">Manchester</placeName> and Bolton), and the
district round Nottingham and Derby, were now the chief
seats of the cotton trade, which in its golden age, between
<date value="1783">1783</date> and <date value="1803">1803</date>, trebled its volume. Robert <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName> of
Blackburn, grandfather of the famous statesman, took up very
vigorously the work of machine calico-printing.
Meanwhile the old staple woollen trade continued to flourish.
Norwich, where crapes, baize, serges, and other light
woollen goods were largely made, went up from 30,000 to 60,000
inhabitants between <date value="1685">1685</date> and <date value="1760">1760</date>.  The increase was
great in the West of England clothing district, where most
of the fine cloth was still made, but it was in the moorland
valleys of the West Riding, where coal was cheap and
water-power plentiful, that it received its greatest development.
<persName key="Arkwright, Richard">Arkwright</persName>'s inventions were modified to suit sheep's wool.
Leeds, the centre of the coarse cloth trade, and Halifax, the
  centre of the worsted manufactures, grew enormously.</p>
    <p>The iron trade was languishing in its old Surrey and
  Sussex homes, as even the dense oak woods of the Weald
  would not supply enough fuel to feed the furnaces. The last
  great job of the Sussex ironmasters was the railings which
  still surround St. Paul's in London. But the application of
  <persName key="Watt, James">Watt</persName>'s steam-engine enabled the last difficulties to be
  overcome in smelting iron with pit-coal. Dr. John Roebuck,
  whose discoveries had largely made this possible, started in
  <date value="1760">1760</date> the Carron Works in <placeName key="Stirlingshire">Stirlingshire</placeName>. In <date value="1755">1755</date> Anthony
  Bacon started the South Wales iron trade, with the works
  at Cyfarthfa, near Merthyr. In <date value="1762">1762</date> the rich and hopeful


<pb id="p.96" n="96"/>


Matthew Boulton opened the Soho Works near Birmingham,
and in <date value="1772">1772</date> took the mechanical genius of <persName key="Watt, James">Watt</persName> into
partnership with himself, and persevered in extending the use of his
inventions, when even <persName key="Watt, James">Watt</persName> nearly gave up in despair. In
<date value="1760">1760</date> Birmingham had at least 50,000 inhabitants, while
Sheffield, the centre of the Hallamshire cutlery trade, had 30,000.
The rude potteries of North Staffordshire was now improved
by the long labours of <persName key="Wedgwood, Josiah">Josiah Wedgwood</persName>, who, in <date value="1763">1763</date>,
first produced his cream-coloured <hi rend="italic">Queen's Ware</hi> (so-called
from the patronage of Queen Charlotte), which was followed
by his beautiful ornamental works, and painted vases which
<persName key="Flaxman, John">Flaxman</persName>, <quote>"the sculptor of eternity,"</quote> designed for him. In
<date value="1785">1785</date>, 15,000 men were employed in the potteries, and
five-sixths of the wares made were exported. In <date value="1773">1773</date> the
manufacture of plate glass began in <placeName key="Lancashire">Lancashire</placeName>. The linen trade
grew in Paisley and in the north of Ireland. The French silk
weavers still flourished at Spitalfields, and other centres of
the silk trade were Coventry, Macclesfield, and Paisley.</p>
  <p>3. <note place="foot" n="3">Roads Tramways, and Canals.</note>Better communication was as much needed as
machines to make English trade grow. As long as goods
could only be carried about by pack-horses
along hill paths, or in heavy wagons along
infamous roads, only places near could be
served. But turnpike roads (on which tolls could be levied
to provide means for their repair) were now becoming
general, and between <date value="1760">1760</date> and <date value="1774">1774</date>, 452 Acts of Parliament
were passed for repairing highways; though the roads were
still so bad that it took from Monday night to Wednesday
afternoon for a letter to go from Bath to London. The
great road between Preston and Wigan was full of <quote>"ruts
four feet deep, and floating with mud from a wet summer.
The only mending it receives is the tumbling in
some loose stones, which serve no purpose but jolting a
carriage."</quote>  Within eighteen miles a traveller passed three
broken-down carts. But some roads were being brought
into good condition, and many important bridges were now
built. By the end of the century roads were so smooth and
hard that the fast coaches carrying passengers and mails
could go at a very rapid rate. In <date value="1784">1784</date> the first mailcoach,
on Palmer's plan, left London for Bristol. In <date value="1797">1797</date>, 380
towns that had previously had three posts a week, and 40
which had no posts at all, had daily posts, and the mails
were often conveyed in a quarter of the time formerly taken.</p>
  <p>In the coal-fields, especially in the Tyne district, there were
<hi rend="italic">tramways</hi> or <hi rend="italic">railways</hi> to carry the coals to the ships. <quote>" The


<pb id="p.97" n="97"/>



tracks of the wheels are marked by pieces of timber let into
the road for the wheels of the wagons to run on, by means
of which one horse is able to draw with ease fifty or sixty
bushels of coal." </quote>In <date value="1767">1767</date> cast-iron plates were used to
cover the wooden rails at the Coalbrook Dale Ironworks,
and after <date value="1776">1776</date> cast-iron rails generally superseded wooden
ones.</p>
  <p>The greatest improvement in communications was by the
construction of canals. In <date value="1720">1720</date> an Act was passed to make
the Irwell navigable up to <placeName key="Manchester">Manchester</placeName>, while the opening
out of the Aire and Calder navigation did wonders for the
trade of the West Riding. The famous Francis, Duke of
Bridgwater, called in the assistance of the unlettered but
observant engineer, Brindley, to make a canal to convey
coal from his collieries at Worsley to <placeName key="Manchester">Manchester</placeName> (<date value="1761">1761</date>),
and afterwards extended it to the Mersey at Runcorn, so as
to form a new and certain means of communication between
<placeName key="Manchester">Manchester</placeName> and <placeName key="Liverpool">Liverpool</placeName>. <quote>" The duke could work on his
canal when floods or dry seasons interrupted the navigation
of the Mersey. This gave a certainty and punctuality which
insured a preference to the canal. The emoluments arising
to the duke were not to be mistaken, and, perseverance
having vanquished prejudice, the fire of speculation was
lighted, and canals became the subject of general conversation."</quote>
In <date value="1766">1766</date> Brindley began the Trent and Mersey or
Grand Trunk Canal, which included a tunnel 2880 yards
long. In <date value="1768">1768</date> a ship canal between the Forth and the
Clyde was projected, though it was not until <date value="1790">1790</date> that <quote>"the
union of the two firths was celebrated by the launching of a
hogshead of the water of the Forth into the Clyde."</quote> A
larger ship canal connected Gloucester with the deep waters
of the Severn at Berkeley.  In <date value="1793">1793</date> Telford began the
Ellesmere Canal, which linked Severn, Dee, and Mersey,
and crossed the beautiful Dee valley on Pont y Cysyllt by
an arched viaduct at a height of seventy-five feet above the
river. Gradually the Thames, the Trent, the Severn, and
the Mersey were all connected together. In <date value="1801">1801</date> Telford
began the Caledonian ship canal between Inverness and
Fort-William. Between <date value="1758">1758</date> and <date value="1803">1803</date>, 165 canal Acts were
passed, and nearly 3000 miles of canals constructed. Canals,
furnishing the only means of conveying very heavy goods
and pieces of machinery, were to this period what railways
were to a later age.</p>
   <p>4. The widening of the markets by improved means of
 communication, the great series of inventions, and the great


<pb id="p.98" n="98"/>


increase in the volume of trade, brought about a new and
keener spirit of competition, in which only the strongest,
wisest, and most cunning survived, while the
weaker, lazier, and more sluggish went to the
wall. <note place="foot" n="4">The Factory System and its results.</note>Population increased enormously. Between
<date value="1750">1750</date> and <date value="1800">1800</date> (when the first census was taken) the
population ran up from 6,000,000 to 9,000,000, despite the
fact that the rural population was distinctly on the decline.</p>
  <p>The old domestic system of manufactures gave way to the
<hi rend="italic">factory system</hi>. Manufactures were now centred in growing
towns. Instead of the small master working in his own
home with his one or two apprentices and journeymen, the
rich capitalist-employer with his army of factory hands grew
up. Many of these masters were rough, illiterate, and
hard, though shrewd and far-seeing in business. Their
workmen gathered from all the country round into new,
badly-built, unhealthy brick cottages, and were forced to
work for long hours in dark, dirty, and unwholesome workshops.
The State did nothing to protect them; the masters
only thought of their profits; the national conscience was
dead, and unjust laws prevented them combining together
in trades unions to help themselves. Women and children
were made to work as long and as hard as the men. A
regular system grew up of transporting pauper and destitute
children to weary factory work. There was no care for their
health. There were no schools, and plenty of public-houses.
There were few churches and chapels, though the
Methodists often did something to prevent the people from
falling back into heathendom. The workmen were ignorant,
brutal, poor, and oppressed. In hard times distress was
widespread, and the workmen naturally listened to agitators
and fanatics, or took to violent means of avenging their
wrongs. For they had no constitutional means of redress.
Even the masters had no votes, as the new towns sent no
members to Parliament. The transfer of the balance of
population and wealth from the south and east to the north
and midlands made parliamentary reform necessary.  It
also produced a great deal of rivalry between the rich
manufacturers and the old landed gentry. As after <date value="1760">1760</date> the
latter class became more and more Tory, so did the former
become more and more Radical. And after the Industrial
Revolution had been completed, the manufacturers and
traders were rapidly getting the better of the old aristocracy.</p>
  <p>5. Side by side with the industrial revolution went an
<hi rend="italic">agrarian revolution</hi>.  In <date value="1760">1760</date> a very large proportion


<pb id="p.99" n="99"/>


even of arable land was still common-field, on which after
harvest all householders had the right to turn their cattle,
and which were cultivated on the wasteful old
three years' system  of wheat, fallow, and
barley. <note place="foot" n="5"> The Agrarian Revolution.</note><quote>"Never were more miserable crops
seen than the spring ones in the common fields, absolutely
beyond contempt."</quote> In most parts of the country the farms
were small, and cultivated with little skill or capital.
<quote>"Custom alone,"</quote> says the famous farmer and traveller,
<persName key="Young, Arthur">Arthur Young</persName>, <quote>"has been the guide of the farmer. Deduct
from agriculture all the practices that have made it
flourishing, and you have the management of small farms."</quote> Yet
the small farmer, whose home was often the seat of a domestic
manufacture, was self-supporting and independent of
markets. England was a corn-exporting country up to the
middle of the century, and the export of grain was encouraged
by a bounty of 5s. a quarter when the price of wheat was
under 48s. But the increase of population increased the
demand, and a series of great improvements set in in
agriculture which largely augmented the supply of food. As
early as <date value="1770">1770</date> the husbandry of Norfolk <quote>"had rendered the
name of the county famous in the farming world."</quote>
<quote>" Enclosures, marling, an excellent fourfold rotation of crops,
the culture of turnips, clover, and rye grass, the granting of
long leases, and the division of the country into great
farms,"</quote> were, according to <persName key="Young, Arthur">Arthur Young</persName>, the chief causes of
the improvement of Norfolk agriculture. After <persName key="Townshend, Charles">Townshend</persName>
quarrelled with <persName key="Walpole, Robert">Walpole</persName> and gave up politics, he settled
down to farm on his estate at Raynham, and his example
made the cultivation of the turnip general, and so made it
possible to get rid of the wasteful old system of fallows.</p>
  <p>After <date value="1760">1760</date> improvement grew  more rapid. Between
<date value="1760">1760</date> and <date value="1770">1770</date> there were, says <persName key="Young, Arthur">Young</persName>, <quote>"more experiments,
more discoveries, and more general good sense
displayed in agriculture than in the hundred preceding
years."</quote> Between  <date value="1760">1760</date> and  <date value="1785">1785</date> <persName key="Bakewell, Robert">Robert Bakewell</persName> of
Dishley produced the new Leicestershire breed of sheep,

new <quote>" Leicestershire longhorn,"</quote> or <quote>" Dishley breed"</quote> of
cattle, a <quote>"small, clean-boned, round, short-carcassed,
kindly-looking cattle."</quote> The extension of Bakewell's principles to
the cattle of the Tees valley by the brothers Coiling produced
the still more famous <quote>"shorthorn "</quote> or <quote>"Durham"</quote> breed.</p>

  <p>6. <note place="foot" n="6">Enclosures, Corn Laws, and Pauperism.</note> With <date value="1760">1760</date> began the long series of <hi rend="italics">Enclosure Acts</hi> that
greatly limited common of pasture and almost got rid of the
arable common fields; 3000 enclosure Acts were passed
during <persName key="George IV.">George IV.</persName>'s reign, and by the year <date value="1843">1843</date> seven
million acres of land were enclosed under them
and turned into private property.  The poor
lost their common rights, for the newly enclosed
land nearly all went to the big landlords. Yet the change
was necessary, for, as <persName key="Young, Arthur">Arthur Young</persName> said, <q type="spoken">"without enclosures there can be no good husbandry."</q> Yet, despite
a greater area of tillage and greater produce from the
old farms, England could no longer send abroad any
corn, and in <date value="1773">1773</date> a <hi rend="italics">Corn Law</hi> was passed which let in
foreign corn at a nominal duty when the price of wheat was
48s. a quarter. In <date value="1791">1791</date> was another corn law which made
54s. the limit of the nominal duty. Yet the price of wheat
fluctuated violently. In one year it altered from 56s. to 122s.
The average price between <dateRange from="1785" to="1794">1785 and 1794</dateRange>was under 50s.,
while the average between <dateRange from="1795" to="1800">1795 and 1800</dateRange>  was 87s. Large
farms were now growing up in the place of small farms, so
that in one place <quote>" a single farmer held as one farm the
lands that once formed fourteen farms, bringing up respectably fourteen families."</quote>  The capitalist farmer now came
in like the capitalist employer. His gangs of poor and
ignorant labourers were the counterpart of the swarm of
factory hands. The business of farming was worked more
scientifically, with better tools and greater success; but
after the middle of the century the condition of the agricultural labourer got no better, and now the great mass of the
rural population were mere labourers. For the yeomanry,
which in the seventeenth century had been so powerful, was
now rapidly disappearing except in out-of-the-way corners,
such as the Westmoreland valleys, the isle of Axholme, and
some parts of Wales. The growth of the factory system
prevented their eking out the produce of their little
farms by domestic manufactures, and the enclosure of commons was altogether to their loss. But the great cause of
their decline was the political importance attached to landowning after <date value="1688">1688</date>, which caused great men anxious to
rule the country to buy them up at high prices. It paid
small capitalists better to invest their property in other ways.
So the power of the territorial aristocracy grew, and the
land passed into fewer and fewer hands, for the small
squire, rustic in garb and speech, who never travelled
further than his county town, was swallowed up almost as


<pb id="p.101" n="101"/>





completely as the yeomanry. Meanwhile pauperism became more and more a pressing evil, especially after <date value="1782">1782</date>,
   when <hi rend="italics">Gilbert's Act</hi> abolished the <hi rend="italics">workhouse test</hi> (which
   compelled all who received relief from the rates to go into
   the half-imprisonment of a poorhouse), and the system of
   poor law doles in aid of wages was encouraged by the high
   prices at the end of the century. In <date value="1803">1803</date> one-seventh of the
   people was in receipt of poor law relief. In agriculture as
   in manufactures there was progress.  More wealth was
   accumulated, but it fell into the hands of fewer people.
   Above all, the widened market caused great fluctuations in
   demand, and rapid successions of prosperity and distress;
   but the workmen shared but partially in the prosperity, and
   were the first to bear the brunt of hard times. What is now
   called the struggle for existence had become severer. The
   intense competition of our modern times had set in.</p>
     <p>In the midst of the Industrial Revolution, <persName key="Smith, Adam">Adam Smith</persName>, a Glasgow professor, published in <date value="1776">1776</date> his <hi rend="italics">Enquiry into the
    Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</hi>, which founded
    the modern school of political economy, and taught that free
    trade was the best way to make a nation rich. But in <date value="1798">1798</date>
    Malthus, a clergyman, published his <hi rend="italics">Essay on Population</hi>,
    which showed how all the increased produce did little good
    when population grew faster than the means to support it.
    The end of the century was a time of distress for town and
    country alike.</p>
      <p>7. <note place="foot" n="7">The Evangelical Movement.</note>The religious history of the first half of the century
    centres, as we have seen, round the growth of Latitudinarianism and Deism and the strong reaction of the
    Methodist movement. During the latter half
    of the century these forces still continued to work. But the
    most striking feature in religious life was now the <hi rend="italics">Evangelical Movement</hi>. This was nearly akin to Methodism, and
    yet is not simply a further growth from it. The earliest
    Evangelicals, like Hervey, were also Methodists-but
    the Evangelical Movement was more properly a revival of
    seventeenth century Puritanism, which affected both the
    Church and the older Nonconformist bodies.   It was
    Calvinistic in its theology, and therefore strongly out of
    sympathy with the teaching of <persName key="Wesley, John">Wesley</persName> himself. It did
    not lead to the formation of any new church or sect, but it
    influenced all the existing ones, and produced as its results
    a stronger sense of personal religion and a zeal for good
    works and strong feeling for others, however low a place
    such acts held in the evangelical scheme. The leaders of


<pb id="p.102" n="102"/>





the movement were not learned, but good and self-denying,
though in some ways rather narrow in their teaching.</p>
  <p>Among the early Evangelicals were Toplady, author of
the hymn <soCalled>"Rock of Ages,"</soCalled> Grimshaw, Vicar of Haworth,
and Berridge, Vicar of Everton. The most famous names
connected with later Evangelicalism are William <persName key="Romaine, William">Romaine</persName>
(<date value="1714">1714</date>-<date value="1795">1795</date>), who withdrew from Lady Huntingdon's Connexion in <date value="1781">1781</date> when she practically gave up the Established
Church. He wrote the <hi rend="italics">Life, Walk, and Triumph of Faith</hi>,
and was the strongest Calvinist of all the Evangelical
leaders. Henry Venn (<dateRange from="1725" to="1797">1725-1797</dateRange>), Vicar of Huddersfield,
who also left Lady Huntingdon in <date value="1781">1781</date>, wrote the chief
devotional book of his school, the <hi rend="italics">Complete Duty of Man</hi>.
Other leaders were John Newton (<date value="1725">1725</date>-<date value="1807">1807</date>), the converted
slave-trader; Thomas Scott (<dateRange from="1747" to="1821">1747-1821</dateRange>), whose Biblical
<hi rend="italics">Commentary</hi> was the standard of his party; Joseph Milner
(<dateRange from="1744" to="1797">1744-1797</dateRange>), the author of a <hi rend="italics">Church History</hi> written from
the same standpoint. But the two greatest Evangelicals
were laymen, William <persName key="Cowper, William">Cowper</persName> (<dateRange from="1731" to="1800">1731-1800</dateRange>), the reformer of
English poetry, and <persName key="Wilberforce, William">William Wilberforce</persName>, the Tory member
for Yorkshire and friend of <persName key="Pitt, William">William Pitt</persName>.</p>
  <p>The Evangelicals were specially fond of missionary work.
The London Missionary Society (<date value="1795">1795</date>), the Church Missionary Society (<date value="1799">1799</date>), the Religious Tract Society (<date value="1799">1799</date>),
and the Bible Society (<date value="1802">1802</date>) arose from their teaching.
The general establishment of Sunday Schools was another
result of the movement. In <date value="1781">1781</date> Robert <persName key="Raikes, Robert">Raikes</persName>, a printer,
started his first school at Gloucester, because, he said, <quote>"on
Sunday the streets were filled with a multitude of wretches
who, having no employment, spent their time in noise and
riot, playing at chuck, and cursing and swearing." </quote>In <date value="1785">1785</date>
the Sunday School Society was established.</p>
  <p>In Scotland there was the same contrast as in England
between the prevailing Latitudinarianism and the Puritan
reaction from it. The great question in dispute was the
lawfulness of private patronage, which had been brought
back to the Scotch Church by an Act of Parliament in <date value="1712">1712</date>.
In <date value="1733">1733</date> those who held most strongly the divine right of the
people to choose their own ministers followed Ebenezer
Erskine, who established a new religious body called the
<hi rend="italics">Associate Presbytery</hi>, which later broke up into two. In
<date value="1761">1761</date> another schism on the same point caused the establishment of the <hi rend="italics">Relief Presbytery</hi>. There were no more secessions, but the Scotch Church continued divided into the
<hi rend="italics">Moderates</hi> who upheld and the <hi rend="italics">Evangelicals</hi> who opposed


<pb id="p.103" n="103"/>






the law of patronage. The Moderates, led by Dr. Robertson, the historian, the Principal of the University of Edinburgh, had for many years a majority in the General
Assembly. They were the Scotch Latitudinarians, and
preached
                            <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"cauld harangues</l>
                <l>On practice and on morals."</l>
                <l>"Like Socrates or Antonine,</l>
                  <l>Or some old pagan heathen,</l>
                  <l>The moral man they do define,</l>
                  <l>But ne'er a word o' faith in."</l></quote>

Towards the end of the century the Evangelicals grew much
stronger.</p>
  <p>8. The eighteenth century saw religious toleration established, though not without fierce opposition. <note place="foot" n="8">Religious Toleration.</note>The laws
against disbelievers in the Trinity and against
Roman Catholics gradually fell into disuse, and
the whole temper of the age was against religious persecution. Even the Scotch Episcopalians who would take the
oaths to the Protestant Succession were allowed to meet
together for worship by the Toleration Act of <date value="1712">1712</date>. But
the great mass of that body was Jacobite, and the laws
against them were actively enforced until the accession of
<persName key="George III.">George III.</persName>, and not repealed until <date value="1792">1792</date>. Though the
Indemnity Acts really allowed Dissenters to hold office, the
Test and Corporation Acts still remained the law. The
attempt of <persName key="Pelham, Henry">Pelham</persName> to relieve the Jews from their disabilities,
and the proposed relief to the Catholics in <date value="1780">1780</date>, led to the
strongest opposition. The Evangelical movement was unfavourable to the Roman Catholics' claims to emancipation.
Yet enlightened men like <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> saw that they were both just
and necessary.</p>
   <p>9. The new state of things brought with it many abuses,
 but good and far-seeing men were trying to get rid of them.<note place="foot" n="9">Humanitarianism and Philanthropy.</note>
 The spirit of humanity and philanthropy had
 begun to shine amidst the rough and brutal
 manners of the age. This spirit was largely fed
 from the Methodist and Evangelical movements, but was
 also a good deal due to that wide sympathy for human
 suffering and hot indignation against oppression and in justice which were the best side of the teaching of the
 French freethinkers, which kindled to enthusiasm the
 polished cynicism of <persName key="Voltaire">Voltaire</persName>, and rose to a white heat in
 the fervent sentimentalism of <persName key="Rousseau, Jean Jacques">Rousseau</persName>. In <date value="1802">1802</date> the first


<pb id="p.104" n="104"/>





<persName key="Peel, Robert">Sir Robert Peel</persName> passed the first <hi rend="italics">Factory Act</hi> for regulating
the abuses of the factory system. Though the penal code
was still odiously severe, the proportion of executions to
convictions for the hundred and fifty crimes for which death
was the penalty was growing lower. The practice by which
prisoners who refused to plead were to be crushed to death,
and the law which made burning the way of putting women
traitors to death, were repealed. In <date value="1783">1783</date> the brutal and
riotous procession of London criminals from <placeName key="Newgate">Newgate</placeName> to
<placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName> was abolished, and executions took place in front of
the gaol, where the introduction of the <soCalled>"drop"</soCalled> made
hanging much less cruel and uncertain. The loss of the
American colonies put an end to the system of selling
criminals to the planters, and was succeeded by the much
milder punishment of transportation to the desert continent
of <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>, where in <date value="1788">1788</date> the colony of <placeName key="New South Wales"><hi rend="italics">New South Wales</hi></placeName>
was founded, largely as a penal settlement.</p>
  <p>10. The state of the prisons still continued disgraceful
until the self-denying labours of <hi rend="italics"><persName key="Howard, John">John Howard</persName></hi> had laid bare
their abuses. <note place="foot" n="10"><persName key="Howard, John">Howard</persName> and the prisons. </note>In <date value="1773">1773</date> <persName key="Howard, John">Howard</persName> acted as sheriff
for <placeName key="?">Bedfordshire</placeName>, and found such horrors in the
prisons under his charge that he devoted the whole of the
rest of his life till his death at Kherson in <date value="1790">1790</date> to looking
into and trying to improve the condition of prisons and
hospitals all over Europe.</p>
  <p><persName key="Howard, John">Howard</persName> found <quote>"that many prisons are scantily supplied
and some almost totally destitute of the necessaries of life.
No care was taken of the sick. The debtors had no food
allowance, and were very often the most pitiable objects in
our gaols. The criminals passed their time in sloth, profaneness, and debauchery. Many prisons had no water,
and the malignity of the air was such that his clothes were
so offensive after a visit to them that in a post-chaise
he could not bear the windows drawn up."</quote> <quote>" Many more
prisoners were destroyed by gaol fever than by all the
public executions in the kingdom."</quote> There was no separation of different classes of criminals, and the gaolers were
often cruel tyrants or grasping extortioners.  Through
<persName key="Howard, John">Howard</persName>'s exertions two Acts were passed in <date value="1774">1774</date> which
got rid of the worst abuses, but much still remained to be
done.</p>
  <p>11. The same growth of a humane spirit called attention
to the slave-trade, which in the early part of the century
had been simply looked at as an easy way to get rich.
One Act of Parliament had declared <quote>" that the trade to and


<pb id="p.105" n="105"/>






from Africa is very advantageous to Great Britain, and
necessary for the plantations and colonies."</quote>  <note place="foot" n="11">Movement against the Slave-Trade.</note>
Lord Dartmouth (whom the Evangelical poet <persName key="Cornwallis, Charles">Cornwallis</persName>
celebrated as "one who wears a coronet and
prays"),when Colonial Secretary in <date value="1775">1775</date>, refused
to allow the mutinous colonies <quote>"to check or discourage in
any degree a trade so beneficial to the nation."</quote> The famous
evangelical <persName key="Newton, John">John Newton</persName> continued in command of a slaveship long after his <quote>"conversion."</quote> Though <persName key="Wesley, John">Wesley</persName> had
denounced slavery, <persName key="Whitefield, George">Whitefield</persName> upheld it strongly.</p>
  <p>The Quakers, who, in <date value="1761">1761</date>, had expelled from their body
all occupied in the slave-trade, were almost alone in their
hostility to traffic in human flesh. In <date value="1783">1783</date> a peculiarly
horrible case occurred, when the master of a slaver, finding
sickness breaking out among his cargo, flung 132 negroes
overboard, because, if they died, the loss would fall on the
owners, while if they were thrown overboard for safety, the
loss fell on the <hi rend="italics">underwriters</hi> who had insured the ship.
But in <date value="1772">1772</date> Lord Chief-Justice Mansfield had declared that
any slave brought to England became at once free, and in
<date value="1787">1787</date> the <hi rend="italics">Society for the Abolition of the Slave-Trade </hi>was
formed, of which Granville <persName key="Granville, Sharp">Sharp</persName> was the president, and
<persName key="Clarkson, Thomas">Thomas Clarkson</persName> and <persName key="Wilberforce, William">William Wilberforce</persName> were leading
members. They wisely avoided attacking slavery, and
confined themselves to denouncing the slave-trade. The
hardworking and persistent <persName key="Clarkson, Thomas">Clarkson</persName> collected evidence
of the horrors of the <soCalled>"middle passage"</soCalled> from Africa to
America, in which nearly half of the negroes stolen from
Africa died. In <date value="1788">1788</date> <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> promised an inquiry, and <hi rend="italics">Dolben's
Act</hi> was passed to limit the number of negroes carried in
slave-ships.  Granville <persName key="Granville, Sharp">Sharp</persName> established the colony of
<placeName key="Sierra Leone">Sierra Leone</placeName> in Western Africa as a refuge for freed slaves.
But the outbreak of the French Revolution frightened the
richer classes into opposing the movement. The abolition
of slavery by the <quote>"atheists and anarchists of France"</quote> was
declared a reason why it should be upheld by England.
The support of <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> and of the Whig leaders was not enough
to make up for the hostility of the king and the mass of
the Tories. The century ended with the stoppage of a
most righteous movement, which in <date value="1788">1788</date> seemed just about
to triumph.</p>
   <p>12. Manners were still very rough. Among the upper
 classes the influence of the first two Georges was not a
 good one. Popular literature and the stage were often broad
 and vulgar. The gentry and the lower classes still amused


<pb id="p.106" n="106"/>






themselves with bull-baiting, bear-baiting, cock-fighting,
and back-sword fighting. <note place="foot" n="12">Manners and Amusements.</note>But even here great improvement set in. Broughton made boxing a science,
and his famous rules for the ring did a great
deal to spread a rough love of fairplay among the most
disorderly classes. Men like <persName key="Lawrence, John">John Lawrence</persName>, the manly
Essex farmer, spoke loudly against that cruelty to animals
which <persName key="Hogarth, William">Hogarth</persName> had held up to shame with his pencil and
burin. Horse-racing was brought into greater fashion by
the Duke of <persName key="Cumberland, William, Duke of">Cumberland</persName>, and the breed of blood horses was
again studied with loving care. <persName key="George IV.">George IV.</persName>, when prince,
was a great patron of the turf, until his jockey, Sam Chifney,
was suspected of having pulled his horse <quote>"Escape,"</quote> and
<persName key="George IV.">George</persName> had to give up racing in some disgrace. Gambling
and hard-drinking were still very common, but less so at
the end of the century than at the beginning. <persName key="George III.">George III.</persName>'s
homely and decorous private life had no small influence for
good; but its dulness forced his own sons into riotous disorder, and the <quote>" first gentleman in Europe,"</quote> as his flatterers
called <persName key="George IV.">George IV.</persName>, set an example of everything bad. The
opposition of the <quote>"religious party"</quote> to all amusements, good
or bad, healthful or harmful, did a great deal of harm, and
so did the tendency of the Evangelicals to draw a hard and
fast line between the <quote>" world "</quote> and the few <quote>" professors."</quote></p>
  <p>The tendency of the age was towards the breaking down
of hard class distinctions, and the greater easiness of getting
about produced a greater likeness in manners between the
gentry and tradespeople, and broke down a good deal of
the distinction between town and country. <quote>"Every male
and female,"</quote> it was complained, <quote>" wishes to think and speak,
to eat and drink, and dress and live after the manner of
people of quality in London."</quote> The taste for travelling also
grew. Gentlemen finished their education by making the
<quote>"grand tour"</quote> on the Continent.  The inland watering places, Bath, Clifton, Tunbridge Wells, Buxton, Epsom,
continued to flourish. In <date value="1738">1738</date> Cheltenham Spa first came
into notice. Towards the end of the century the fashion for
sea-bathing set in, and became even more popular than
<quote>"taking the waters."</quote> In <date value="1750">1750</date> Dr. Richard Russell wrote
his book on the advantages of the practice. <persName key="George III.">George III.</persName>
made Weymouth popular. His eldest son did even more
for Brighton. Before the end of the century <persName key="Cornwallis, Charles">Cornwallis</persName> complained how
     <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"Your prudent grandmammas, ye modern belles,</l>

        <l>With one consent, to rush into the sea.</l></quote></p>

  <p>13. The dress of the upper classes was still very costly
and rich. Men dressed in silks and velvets, and wore as
many colours as women. <note place="foot" n="13">Dress.</note>Lord Derwentwater
went to execution in a scarlet coat, faced with
black velvet and trimmed with gold. Even Dr. <persName key="Johnson, Samuel">Johnson</persName>,
who, as a rule, dressed very simply, put on a scarlet waistcoat, richly laced with gold, and a gold-laced hat in honour
of the first night of his play of <hi rend="italics">Irene</hi>. <persName key="Wilkes, John">Wilkes</persName> generally showed
off his ugly face by a scarlet or green coat. A fashionable
highwayman went to <placeName key="Tyburn">Tyburn</placeName> to be hung dressed in blue
and gold. <persName key="Fox, Charles James">Fox</persName> and the Whigs adopted the blue and buff
of the <quote>" Continental"</quote> troops as the Whig party dress and
colours. Every physician still wore an enormous wig, and
carried a huge silver-mounted cane. Even poor country
curates, like <persName key="Fielding, Henry">Fielding</persName>'s Parson Adams, always went about
in their cassocks. Bishops dressed in <quote>"wigs, purple coats,
short cassocks, stockings, and cocked hats."</quote> <quote>"No Minister
went down to the House without being full dressed and
with his sword by his side."</quote> Lord <persName key="North, Lord">North</persName> wore the Order of
the Garter so constantly that he was nearly always described
in the House of Commons as <quote>" the noble lord in the blue
ribbon."</quote> Noblemen travelled in great pomp with outriders
and four horses at least.</p>
   <p>The simpler styles of modern dress gradually set in, as a
 result of the influence of <persName key="Rousseau, Jean Jacques">Rousseau</persName>, who taught that the
 equality of men should even extend to their clothes, and
 believed modern civilisation was a terrible decline from
 the golden state of nature when all men were brothers.
 <q type="spoken">"Dress,"</q> says a shrewd observer, <q type="spoken">"never totally fell, till the
 era of Jacobinism and equality."</q> Wigs were given up, and the
 hairdressers bitterly complained of gentlemen who wore their
 own hair and forced them to work on Sundays in dressing
 it. Hair powder, which was used after wigs went out, never
 survived <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName>'s tax of a guinea a year in <date value="1795">1795</date>. About <date value="1780">1780</date>
 swords went out of fashion. Umbrellas became common,
 though, like coaches at an earlier date, they were at first
 disliked as effeminate. A little later tall beaver hats replaced


<pb id="p.108" n="108"/>





cocked hats; and shoe strings came in instead of
silver buckles. Pantaloons and Hessian boots superseded
knee-breeches, silk stockings, and shoes. <quote>"Peers,"</quote> complains a lover of old ways, <quote>" now dressed like shopkeepers,
horse-dealers, and tradesmen, with coloured neckcloths and
boots."</quote> But though dress got more simple, love of show
found other ways to display itself.  Old-fashioned people
complained that the rich tradesman gave up living over
his shop for a suburban villa, and aped in his style of living,
his carriages, his travels, and his wife and daughters'
dresses, the manners of the landed gentry. With less vain
pomp, comfort and refinement grew, and, with high prices,
made living much dearer. The radical Horne Tooke complained of the <quote>"luxury and corruption that had flowed in
like a torrent from our connection with <placeName key="India">India</placeName>."</quote></p>
  <p>14. Early in the century architecture was the most
flourishing of the arts, but later on it declined, while painting,
sculpture, and music made great progress.
<note place="foot" n="14">Architecture.</note>  The plain, picturesque, and convenient <soCalled>" Queen
<persName key="Anne">Anne</persName>"</soCalled> style of domestic architecture has been largely revived in our own day. Queen <persName key="Anne">Anne</persName>'s Act for building
fifty new churches round London gave the pupils of Wren
good chances of showing their skill. James Gibbs built
<placeName key="St. Martin's-in-the-Fields">St. Martin's-in-the-Fields</placeName> with its noble portico and graceful
spire and the majestic dome of the Radcliffe Library at
Oxford.  Hawksmoor strove to rival his master in the
elegant interior of <placeName key="St. Mary's-Woolnoth">St. Mary's-Woolnoth</placeName>. Scores of great
houses of vast proportions rose up all over the country, such
as <persName key="Churchill, John, Earl of Marlborough">Marlborough</persName>'s splendid palace of Blenheim, near Woodstock, and the Earl of Carlisle's magnificent mansion of
Castle Howard, near York, both the work of the eccentric
and irregular genius of Vanbrugh. But the English school
of classical architecture died away, and the example of Lord
Burlington, an elegant but commonplace amateur, brought
in meagre imitations of the style of Palladio.</p>
  <p>As the century advanced, many hideous and formless
brick buildings were run up.  Towards the end James
Wyatt tried to revive Gothic architecture, which had up
to now been looked on almost universally with contempt.
But he had neither the knowledge nor the taste for this.
He nearly ruined Salisbury Cathedral with his <quote>"restorations,"</quote>
and put a commonplace though grandiose palace on the site
of the historical castle of Windsor. But the height of bad
taste was found in the grotesque and fantastic Pavilion on
which the Prince Regent wasted huge sums at Brighton.</p>

 <persName key="Hogarth, William">Hogarth</persName> (<date value="1697">1697</date>-<date value="1764">1764</date>), whose strong and biting satires give
us so vivid a picture of English manners, alone
broke the monotony of the weak imitations of
Kneller, until the great Sir <persName key="Reynolds, Joshua">Joshua Reynolds</persName> (<date value="1723">1723</date>-<date value="1792">1792</date>)
founded a national school of painting. <note place="foot" n="15">Painting.</note>In <date value="1768">1768</date> the <hi rend="?">Royal

President. At its yearly exhibitions were seen the vast
historic canvases of Benjamin West the Quaker, the poetic
landscapes of <persName key="Wilson, Richard">Richard Wilson</persName>, the magnificent portraits of
the President, and the charming work of Thomas Gainsborough, equally great in landscape and in portraiture. In
sculpture the Frenchman Roubiliac (d. <date value="1762">1762</date>) had the
greatest fame of his day, but in the next age Bacon, Banks,
Nollekens, and, above all, John <persName key="Flaxman, John">Flaxman</persName> (<dateRange from="1755" to="1826">1755-1826</dateRange>) established a native British school. The Wedgwoods' pottery
claims a place in the history of art as well as in that of
industry. The broad and vigorous political caricatures of
Gillray and Rowlandson carried on the spirit and the
humour of <persName key="Hogarth, William">Hogarth</persName>. <persName key="Boydell, John">John Boydell</persName>, engraver, publisher, and
lord mayor, made English engraving admired throughout
Europe.  Bartolozzi produced his refined etchings and
original <quote>"red chalk"</quote> engravings. The Bewicks brought
wood engraving from a low ebb to an extraordinary
delicacy and perfection.</p>
  <p>16. In music the untimely death of <persName key="Purcell, Henry">Purcell</persName> (<date value="1695">1695</date>) cut off
the prospect of a great school, but the sound traditions of
Anglican church music still lingered on in many
a cathedral close, and glees, madrigals, and
ballads of great merit were composed. <note place="foot" n="16">Music</note>The introduction of

<hi rend="italics">Oratorio</hi>, and produced in <date value="1741">1741</date> his sublime <hi rend="italics">Messiah</hi>. In
London this at first fell flat, but it soon won a popularity
that resulted in a wider love of serious music and a higher
sense of the aims and dignity of the art.  In <date value="1776">1776</date> the
<hi rend="italics">Concert of Ancient Music</hi> was established to perform <quote>"such
solid productions of old masters as an intemperate rage for

novelty has too soon laid aside."</quote>  Out of these famous
concerts sprang the <hi rend="italics"><persName key="Handel, Frederick">Handel</persName> Commemoration</hi> of <date value="1784">1784</date>. But
though much good work was done in nearly every branch,
the general level of taste and feeling was not very high in
any of the arts at the end of the eighteenth century.</p>
   <p><note place="foot" n="17">Literature.</note>17. Literature and language faithfully mirrored back the
age. The poets lacked passion and imagination, and were
fast bound by self-imposed rules. Their favourite
metre was the <hi rend="italics">heroic couplet</hi>, their favourite themes
were satire, compliment, and criticism. The tendencies of
the time were best expressed in the exquisitely finished and
polished verse of <persName key="Pope, Alexander">Alexander Pope</persName> (<date value="1688">1688</date>-<date value="1744">1744</date>), who towered
far above poets such as Prior, Gay, Parnell, not to speak of
the swarm of Grub Street hacks that he ridiculed in the
<hi rend="italics">Dunciad</hi>. But in <persName key="Pope, Alexander">Pope</persName>'s followers the style which a great
artist could ennoble became vapid, commonplace and artificial. The drama declined like poetry. The so-called
<soCalled>" Restoration "</soCalled> school died away. <persName key="Addison, Joseph">Addison</persName>'s attempt to bring
into England the severe and stately forms of the classic
French drama led only to his artificial but much quoted
<hi rend="italics">Cato</hi> (<date value="1713">1713</date>), and perhaps to <persName key="Johnson, Samuel">Johnson</persName>'s stilted <hi rend="italics">Irene</hi> (<date value="1749">1749</date>).
The sentimental comedy which begins with <persName key="Steele, Rishard">Steele</persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Lying
Lover</hi> appealed to the heart more than the head, while the
broad farces of <persName key="Fielding, Henry">Fielding</persName> and Foote have no great claim to
permanent fame. The last great dramas of the old style
were <persName key="Goldsmith, Oliver">Oliver Goldsmith</persName>'s (<date value="1728">1728</date>-<date value="1774">1774</date>) refined and humorous
<hi rend="italics">She Stoops to Conquer</hi>, and the brilliant and epigrammatic <hi rend="italics">Rivals</hi> (<date value="1775">1775</date>) and <hi rend="italics">School for Scandal</hi> (<date value="1777">1777</date>), the
fruitful and youthful work of Richard Brinsley <persName key="Sheridan, Richard Brinsley">Sheridan</persName>,
the Whig orator and partisan. But though few great plays
were now produced, the drama more than held its own as
a popular amusement, and the age of David <persName key="Garrick, David">Garrick</persName>, the
famous player and manager (<date value="1716">1716</date>-<date value="1779">1779</date>) marked perhaps the
most flourishing period of English acting.</p>
  <p>Prose was better now than poetry. The end of the seventeenth century saw the establishment of a standard prose
style, polished, easy, idiomatic, forcible, and exact. The
English language became much what it still remains, though
perhaps there was a leaning towards its Latin and Romance
rather than its Teutonic elements.  Even the mass of
pamphlets and newspapers that reflected the political and
theological controversies of the time showed the spread of a
good style of writing. The <hi rend="italics">periodical essay</hi>, which began
with <persName key="Steele, Rishard">Steele</persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi> in <date value="1709">1709</date>, became famous when <persName key="Addison, Joseph">Addison</persName>
joined him, and reached its height when in <date value="1711">1711</date> the two

friends began the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, which <quote>" brought philosophy out
of closets, libraries and schools to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffee-houses."</quote> <hi rend="italics">The Guardian</hi>, the
<hi rend="italics">Freeholder</hi>, and in a later generation <persName key="Johnson, Samuel">Johnson</persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Rambler</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">Idler</hi>, kept up the popularity of essay writing; but
under <persName key="Johnson, Samuel">Johnson</persName>'s hands it lost the lightness of touch which
was its greatest charm, and gave place to the magazine,
the novel, and the political newspaper The terrible <persName key="Swift, Jonathan">Jonathan Swift</persName>, Dean of St. Patrick's (<dateRange from="1667" to="1745">1667-1745</dateRange>), wrote the most
nervous and robust of English prose, and the keenest and
most biting satire on his fellow-men. His last great work,
before his mind gave way in his lonely Irish exile, was his
famous <hi rend="italics">Gulliver's Travels</hi> (<date value="1726">1726</date>). The greatest men of
letters joined in the eager political controversies of the time.
<persName key="Swift, Jonathan">Swift</persName> fiercely upheld the Tories and the Peace of Utrecht.
Against him the polished <persName key="Addison, Joseph">Joseph Addison</persName> wrote his way
with his Whig pamphlets to a secretaryship of state. The
strong but unscrupulous <persName key="Defoe, Daniel">Daniel Defoe</persName>, whose <hi rend="italics">Robinson
Crusoe </hi>(<date value="1719">1719</date>) showed at its best his gift for <quote>"forging a
story and imposing it on the world for truth,"</quote> wrote in his
<hi rend="italics">Review</hi> and a whole host of pamphlets on behalf of the
Whigs and the Dissenters. The wise and good George
Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne in Ireland (<date value="1685">1685</date>-<date value="1753">1753</date>), carried
on the work of <persName key="Locke, John">John Locke</persName>, and answered the English
Deists by denying the reality of matter in a style almost
perfect for its clearness, strength, and balance.</p>
  <p>In the new generation the Novel grew out of the form
of the old romance turned to describe real life, and got its
full growth in the broad and genial works of <persName key="Fielding, Henry">Henry Fielding</persName>,
the sentimental and pathetic writings of <persName key="Richardson, Samuel">Samuel Richardson</persName>,
the rough but vigorous painting of manners of <persName key="Smollett, Tobias">Tobias
Smollett</persName>, the quaint humour of <persName key="Sterne, Lawrence">Lawrence Sterne</persName>, and <persName key="Goldsmith, Oliver">Oliver Goldsmith</persName>'s
charming idyll, the <hi rend="italics">Vicar of Wakefield</hi>. Rough,
kind, and noble Dr. <persName key="Johnson, Samuel">Samuel Johnson</persName> (<dateRange from="1709" to="1784">1709-1784</dateRange>), poet,
essayist, moralist, critic, and writer of an English Dictionary, was the centre of the literary life of more than one
generation, so vividly pictured for us in <persName key="Boswell, James">James Boswell</persName>'s
matchless <hi rend="italics">Life of <persName key="Johnson, Samuel">Johnson</persName></hi>, and meeting together on one
evening a week at the Turk's Head in Soho, in the <hi rend="italics">Literary
Club,</hi> or <persName key="Johnson, Samuel">Johnson</persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Club</hi>, as it was often called. History
lost in accuracy and depth what it gained in art in the
brilliant but superficial <hi rend="italics">History of England</hi> (<date value="1754">1754</date>) of David
<persName key="Hume, David">Hume</persName>.   It kept a colder but more serious form in the
commonplace but much admired works of Principal
Robertson, and combined a scholarship that has never


<pb id="p.112" n="112"/>




been overthrown with the stateliest, most artificial of styles
in the <hi rend="italics">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</hi> (<date value="1776">1776</date>) of
<persName key="Gibbon, Edward">Edward Gibbon</persName>. But the eighteenth century cared little
for history except as an elegant amusement, and preferred
to build up its theories of life and nature without its aid.
<persName key="Hume, David">Hume</persName>'s greatness as a philosopher is almost the measure
of his failure as an historian. From his impulse has flowed
nearly all later English thought on the nature of knowledge, and reality, and the character of moral action.
<persName key="Burke, Edmund">Edmund Burke</persName> alone of that age knew how deep the roots
of the present lie in the past.</p>
  <p>A great change came over English thought and literature
about the middle of the century. A new school of poetry
arose with Allan Ramsay's <hi rend="italics">Gentle Shepherd</hi> (<date value="1725">1725</date>), and
James <persName key="Thomson, James">Thomson</persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Seasons</hi> (<date value="1730">1730</date>). It received a great
stimulus from the revived study of the romantic past which
was brought about by the publication of the old ballads
contained in Bishop Percy's <hi rend="italics">Reliques of Ancient English
Poetry</hi> ( <date value="1765">1765</date>), and by the renewed study of Chaucer, Shakspere, and the Elizabethan dramatists, which was first
marked by the Shaksperian revival brought about on the
stage by <persName key="Garrick, David">Garrick</persName>, and in literature by a whole series of commentaries and editions of the greatest of English writers.
Even the turgid bombast which <persName key="Macpherson, James">Macpherson</persName> published in
<date value="1762">1762</date> as the poems of the old Gael Ossian had extraordinary
influence from its depicting a free, rugged, unconventional
society, and because with much that was forged it included fragments of real Highland tradition. The style
and subject of poetry equally changed. The way of writing
became more varied and natural, and bit by bit poets shook
off the bondage of the heroic couplet. Writers again began
to revel in country life and in beautiful scenery, and even in
the fierce and wild mountains, hitherto an object of horror,
which they described with sympathy and enthusiasm. Their
view of man became enlarged, widened, and deepened, and
they went through the artificialities and conventionalities
of society down to the elemental passions of the human
heart. The all-pervading influence of <persName key="Rousseau, Jean Jacques">Rousseau</persName> was felt
here as in politics, in religion, philanthropy, and manners.
The new spirit took different shapes in the spontaneous and
musical lyrics and living satires in the northern dialect of
the Ayrshire farmer, <persName key="Burns, Robert">Robert Burns</persName> (<date value="1759">1759</date>-<date value="1796">1796</date>), the delicate
humour and pure natural feeling of <persName key="Cowper, William">William Cowper</persName>
(<dateRange from="1731" to="1800">1731-1800</dateRange>), the stern and realistic pictures of village life of
George <persName key="Crabbe, George">Crabbe</persName> (<dateRange from="1754" to="1832">1754-1832</dateRange>), and even the Elizabethan tone

and strange prophetic vision of the neglected poet and
artist, <persName key="Blake, William">William Blake</persName> (<dateRange from="1757" to="1827">1757-1827</dateRange>). Towards the end of the
century it comes to a head in the so-called <hi rend="italics">Lake School</hi>,
of which <persName key="Wordsworth, William">Wordsworth</persName> and <persName key="Coleridge, Samuel">Coleridge</persName> are the highest types.
But before this all the old landmarks were changed by the
outbreak of the French Revolution.</p></div2>

  <p>1. In <date value="1789">1789</date> the French Revolution broke out, towards
which things had been for a long time drifting. <note place="foot" n="1">The French Revolution, <dateRange from="1789" to="1793">1789-93</dateRange>.</note>
France had become the centre of the destructive
and restless eighteenth-century spirit. All the
later attacks on the old order of things had come from
French men of letters. They had vigorously denounced the
many old-fashioned and, as they thought, now useless institutions that had come down from the Middle Ages. They
had attacked all authority, all vested interests, everything
that could not give some plain reason for existing. <hi rend="italics"><persName key="Voltaire">Voltaire</persName></hi>
and the <hi rend="italics">Encyclopaedists</hi> (Diderot, D'Alembert, and the other
contributors to the famous French <hi rend="italics">Encyclopedie</hi>) had taught
the supremacy of reason, of humanity and common-sense.
But <hi rend="italics"><persName key="Rousseau, Jean Jacques">Jean Jacques Rousseau</persName></hi>, a Genevese settled in France,
was the great constructive teacher of the new order. He
united all that was most true and all that was most false of
the tendency of the times. His warm and generous enthusiasm, his power of setting forth the current political and
social ideals in a clear, brilliant, and fascinating style, gave
him an influence over action such as no other man of letters
has ever had. He declared that civilisation had obscured
the original virtues of the natural man, taught a new sentimental Deism, and a new method of education.   He
preached with religious fervour a new political gospel of
the rights of man and of liberty, equality, and fraternity.
He maintained that all governments were unlawful that did
not depend on the sovereign people.</p>
   <p>In some countries royal philosophers, like the Emperor
 Joseph II. and <persName key="Catharine II.">Catharine II.</persName> of Russia, had tried to reform
 their states after the French models. But in France itself


<pb id="p.114" n="114"/>



     <note place="top" n="1">[<dateRange from="1789" to="1793">1789-1793</dateRange>.]</note>
there was no real attempt at political or social reform. The
great monarchy of <persName key="Louis XIV.">Louis XIV.</persName> had decayed hopelessly
under the weak and wicked <persName key="Louis XV.">Louis XV.</persName> (<dateRange from="1715" to="1774">1715-1774</dateRange>), whose
grandson and successor, <persName key="Louis XVI.">Louis XVI.</persName>, though not a bad man,
was neither intelligent, hardworking, nor strong enough to
set things right. The nobles lived in luxury at Court, and
the people were ground down by heavy taxes and oppressive
feudal dues, such as working on their lords' fields and mending the highways, or grinding their corn at their lords' mills.
This was all the more felt, as the nobles had no political
power, and did nothing in return for what they took from
the people. The obscure but powerful <hi rend="italics">intendants</hi> who ruled
each province, and the greedy farmers of the taxes, were
however equally incompetent and still more hated. The
government was corrupt and constantly changing. In the
Church, which had lost almost all hold over the nation, rich
bishops took the pay, and poverty-stricken curates did the
work. The privileged orders paid hardly any direct taxes.
Neither they nor the people had any control of the government.</p>
  <p>The American war showed that the French state was
bankrupt and had spread republican ideas. Things now
went so badly that, after every other plan had been tried
and failed, <persName key="Louis XVI.">Louis XVI.</persName> was compelled to summon the Three
Estates (which had never met since <date value="1614">1614</date>) at Versailles.
This was on 5th May <date value="1789">1789</date>, and was the beginning of the
Revolution. Power now fell into the hands of men disgusted with all that existed, with much honest zeal for reform,
yet with no practical knowledge how to govern a state, and
looking for guidance to the fine-sounding but unreal notions
of <persName key="Rousseau, Jean Jacques">Rousseau</persName>. They at once swept away all the old institutions of France, and built up a new Constitution that made
the executive government too weak to keep order, and
allowed the Paris mob to become the real ruler. The
<hi rend="italics">Bastille</hi>, the state prison of Paris, was stormed and destroyed on 14th July <date value="1789">1789</date>. The king and the Assembly
were driven to Paris by the mob. The Court called for
foreign aid, and the nobles fled to Germany. The moderate
men were pushed aside in the stress of peril, and the most
radical of the revolutionaries got everything into their hands.
In <date value="1792">1792</date> the new Constitution was superseded by a revolutionary government controlled by the <hi rend="italics">Jacobins</hi>, as the
extremists were called, from the club which met in the old
Jacobin convent of the Black Friars. The king and queen
were now tried and beheaded. Priests and aristocrats were


<pb id="p.115" n="115"/>




hunted down; the Church was disestablished, and Christianity seemed likely to be stamped out. All armed opposition
was crushed. This was the period of the <hi rend="italics">Reign of Terror</hi>.</p>
  <p>In <date value="1792">1792</date> Prussia and Austria went to war against the
Revolution, and invaded <placeName key="Lorraine">Lorraine</placeName>, but were driven out of
France by the <hi rend="italics">Cannonade of Valmy</hi>. It soon became a
war of opinion and ideas. A fervid spirit of propagandism
inspired the French governments and armies. Their extraordinary vigour, self-sacrifice, faith, and energy led to victory, and the soldiers of the Revolution were everywhere
welcomed as liberators in the lands they invaded.</p>
  <p>2. At first most Englishmen looked on the Revolution
with favour, thinking that the French were going to make
their government very much like the English.

The political societies, which had slept since
the decline of the <persName key="Wilkes, John">Wilkes</persName> agitation, revived and
became active supporters of it. The <hi rend="italics">Revolution
Society</hi> hoped that France would <quote>" encourage other nations

that the capture of the Bastille was <quote>"the greatest and best

<persName key="Burke, Edmund">Burke</persName> saw quite early that the Revolution was conducted
<quote>"in a spirit well calculated to overturn states, but perfectly
unfit to amend them."</quote>  In November <date value="1790">1790</date> he published
<hi rend="italics">Reflections on the French Revolution</hi>, followed by his
<hi rend="italics">Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs</hi>.   Tom <persName key="Paine, Thomas">Paine</persName>

and James <persName key="Mackintosh, James, Sir">Mackintosh</persName>, an accomplished and rising Whig,
in his more refined <hi rend="italics">Vindicia Gallicae</hi>.  Smug self-satisfied
William Godwin's <hi rend="italics">Political Justice</hi> (<date value="1793">1793</date>), and his wife, the

expressed the revolutionary spirit.

   <p><persName key="Burke, Edmund">Burke</persName> gave the tone to the mass of English opinion.
 A few dreamers still upheld the Revolution, such as Robert
 <persName key="Burns, Robert">Burns</persName>, the Scotch poet, and William <persName key="Wordsworth, William">Wordsworth</persName>, then a
 young man fresh from Cambridge, who soon got disgusted,
 and turned Tory. It was feared that the distressed factory
 hands would listen readily to Jacobin agitators.  But
 though want of bread produced riots, and <quote>"trees of liberty,"</quote>
 after the French fashion, were planted at Dundee and
 Sheffield, there was little deep sympathy with the French

anywhere, and the Birmingham Tory mob burnt the library
of the famous chemist, Dr. <persName key="Priestley, Joseph">Priestley</persName>, who was forced to
seek peace and freedom in America. All who respected
the old constitution, revered the Established Church, or
valued property, joined in <persName key="Burke, Edmund">Burke</persName>'s cry, <quote>"Flee from
the French Revolution,"</quote> and rallied round <persName key="George III.">George</persName> and
<persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> in the struggle against it. The old party lines were
blotted out, and a new and anti-revolutionary Toryism took
hold of the Whigs who followed <persName key="Burke, Edmund">Burke</persName>. A faithful few
still adhered to <persName key="Fox, Charles James">Fox</persName>, but they were powerless in a
church-and-king parliament, and unpopular in the country. In
<date value="1794">1794</date> <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> strengthened the ministry by adding to it Portland,
Fitz-William, and some of the Whigs of the school of <persName key="Burke, Edmund">Burke</persName>.
Fear of anarchy drove him into new courses far from his
old liberal leanings. He ceased to support Parliamentary
Reform. He suspended the <hi rend="italics">Habeas Corpus Act</hi>. He put
down even lawful agitation with a strong hand, prosecuted
a Scotchman named Muir for spreading Tom <persName key="Paine, Thomas">Paine</persName>'s books,
and tried, though in vain, to convict for treason the four
Radical leaders Hardy, Horne Tooke, Thelwall, and Joyce.
He became the advocate of coercion and repression, thinking it no time to mend the constitution when its very
existence was in danger.</p>
   <p>3. On 21st January <date value="1793">1793</date> <persName key="Louis XVI.">Louis XVI.</persName> was executed, and

<quote>"It will be a long and dangerous war"</quote> was
<persName key="Burke, Edmund">Burke</persName>'s true prophecy. <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName>, so successful as a
peace minister, proved much less capable of
carrying on a long war. He showed indeed
abundant energy, formed a great Coalition against the
French, and lavished vast subsidies on his allies. But he
did not grasp how hard the struggle was, and the generals
who carried out his policy were often dull and incapable.
Nothing could stop the enthusiasm and energy of the
French.  They conquered the Austrian Netherlands and
Germany on the left bank of the Rhine. They occupied
Holland, expelled <persName key="George III.">George</persName>'s cousin, the Stadtholder, and
defeated <persName key="George III.">George</persName>'s second son, Frederick, Duke of York, a
foolish man and incompetent general.  They conquered
Savoy and Nice from the King of <placeName key="Sardinia">Sardinia</placeName>. They put down
the heroic Royalist and Catholic revolts in La Vendee and
Brittany. In <date value="1795">1795</date> Prussia, Spain, and some of the smaller
states were frightened into peace, and Holland (now a
republic under French control) and Spain actually joined

the war against England. As the <hi rend="italics">Reign of Terror</hi> of the
Jacobins was now succeeded by the more moderate government of the <hi rend="italics">Executive Directory</hi>
established by the <hi rend="italics">Constitution of the Year III</hi>. (Oct. <date value="1795">1795</date>), <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> himself entered
into peace negotiations (<date value="1796">1796</date>). But they broke down, and
zealots like <persName key="Burke, Edmund">Burke</persName> rejoiced that a <quote>"regicide peace"</quote> had failed.
In <date value="1796">1796</date> a new French leader arose in a young Corsican
artillery officer, <persName key="Napoleon I.">Napoleon Buonaparte</persName>, a protege of the old
Jacobin leader, Robespierre, who, in a campaign of unexampled brilliancy and success, drove the Austrians out of
Italy, and forced them to save themselves by the Treaty of
Campo Formio (<date value="1797">1797</date>), which left Italy to the French, and
arranged for a conference to settle Germany.</p>
  <p>Affairs in England had now become critical. In <date value="1795">1795</date> an
expedition to Quiberon Bay, to help the Breton insurgents,
failed. In <date value="1796">1796</date>, though their expedition to Ireland was dispersed by a storm, some French managed to land near
Fishguard, in South Wales.  They surrendered the next
day to Lord Cawdor's militia, but they proved how easy an
invasion was.  On 14th February <date value="1797">1797</date> Sir John Jervis
won a great victory over the Spaniards off Cape St. Vincent
(for which he was made Lord St. Vincent), which showed
that England could still hold her own at sea. Yet the navy
was so badly looked after, that the sailors grew discontented
with their scanty rations of unwholesome food, and their
pay, which had remained the same since the days of Charles
II. In May formidable mutinies broke out at Spithead and
the Nore. They were soon put down. The ringleader,
Richard <persName key="Parker, Richard">Parker</persName>, an able and disinterested man, was hanged,
but the worst abuses were abolished. The mutinous crews
went back to duty, and, under the popular Admiral Duncan,
beat the Dutch off Camperdown (Oct. <date value="1797">1797</date>.) Earlier in the
year the drain of gold from England to pay the allies had produced a Monetary Crisis, in which many merchants, though
holding much property, could not pay their debts, because
there was not enough gold and silver in the country to meet
them. This was only set right by the Bank of England
suspending cash payments--that is, refusing to give gold to any
one who took its notes to the Bank.</p>
    <p>4. The treaty of Campo Formio left England to fight

despotic power, and the sovereignty of the people reduced to a sham.

further resistance the Austrians signed the Treaty of Luneville, and
recognised all the French conquests (<date value="1800">1800</date>). Meanwhile the eccentric
Czar Paul I. formed a new Armed Neutrality of the Northern

The emperor Paul was now murdered by a gang of courtiers, and

  <p>1. <note place="foot" n="1">The Penal Code.</note> During the first half of the eighteenth century the
absolute Protestant Ascendency established by <persName key="William III.">William III.</persName>'s
victories went on. A Penal Code was bit by
bit drawn up which took away from  Irish
Roman Catholics nearly everything that made life worth
living. The Catholic worship was never wholly put down,
but the priests were registered, and ordered to take an
abjuration oath which their Church thought sinful. Nonjuring priests and all bishops, monks, and friars were felons
liable to death, and were therefore at the mercy of any informer. Priest-hunting became a trade, and the Roman
Catholic bishops were forced to lurk in disguise out in the
bogs or on the mountains.</p>
  <p>No Catholic could hold any office or vote at any election.
No Catholic could be a sheriff, a member of Parliament, a
barrister, an attorney, or a gamekeeper, and in most towns
corporation by-laws shut him out from the higher branches


<pb id="p.121" n="121"/>











of trade. He could not bear the sword which was the mark
of a gentleman without a licence that was hard to get. If
he owned horses, any Protestant could force him to sell
them for five pounds apiece. He could not send his children to a school of his own faith, either at home or abroad.
He could not hold land by lease for more than thirty-one
years, and if the profit was more than one-third of the rent,
the lease could be handed over to the Protestant who found
it out. If the son of a Catholic landlord turned Protestant,
he could turn his father's estate into a rentcharge for life,
and secure the succession over his brothers. To prevent
Catholics holding large estates, their lands were equally
divided at their death among their children. A still coarser
inducement to turn Protestant was the system of Charter
Schools started in <date value="1733">1733</date> to <quote>"rescue the souls of thousands of poor children from the danger of Popish superstition and idolatry, and their bodies from the miseries of
idleness and beggary."</quote> But <quote>" such was the bigotry of the
deluded people that nothing but absolute want could prevail on them to suffer their children to receive an education
which endangered their salvation."</quote> Only in times of famine
were the Charter Schools filled.</p>
  <p>The Catholics were described by Lords-Lieutenant as the
<quote>"common enemy." </quote>   The best and bravest found in the
service of foreign kings the career foolishly and cruelly
denied them at home. The rest lived out a hopeless and
spiritless life in their native land. Yet they clung bravely
to their faith, and the country was covered with mass-houses
and swarming with priests, for the penal laws were too
wicked to be fully carried out even by the tyrants that had
passed them.</p>
   <p>2. <note place="foot" n="2">The Land system.</note>In every other way the state of the peasantry was very
 wretched. The land was owned almost altogether by Pro testants, who were too often either absentee
 grandees or wasteful and poverty-stricken
 squireens. To save trouble the larger landlords let out
 their land to middlemen, and there were often three or four
 of these between the owner and the actual tiller of the soil.
 In the richer districts there were large grazing farms which
 did very well, but gave little work to labourers. But a large
 mass of the soil was let out in patches of a few acres to
 miserable cottiers, who paid everything away in rent, except
 what barely kept them and their large families alive.
 Thrift, industry, foresight were impossible under such a
 system. <quote>"What with the severe exactions of rent, of the

parish clergyman, who, not content with the tithe of grain,
exacts even the very tenth of the potatoes; of the Catholic
priest, who comes armed with the terrors of damnation, and
demands his full quota, the poor reduced wretches have hardly
the skin of a potato left them to subsist on."</quote> <quote>"The highroads throughout the south and west are lined with beggars,
who live in cabins of such shocking materials that you may
see the smoke ascending from every inch of the roof, and
the rain drops on the half-naked, shivering, and almost halfstarving inhabitants within."</quote> <quote>"The landlords get all that
is made off the land, and the peasants poverty and potatoes."</quote>
<quote>"For,"</quote> says Dean <persName key="Swift, Jonathan">Swift</persName>,<quote> "it is the usual practice of the
Irish tenant rather than want land to offer more than he
knoweth he can ever be able to pay; in that case he
groweth desperate and payeth nothing at all."</quote> <quote>" The Irish
tenants,"</quote> said <persName key="Swift, Jonathan">Swift</persName> again, <quote>"lived worse than English beggars." </quote>As the century grew older their troubles increased,
for in <date value="1735">1735</date> pasture-lands were practically relieved from
tithe, and the landlords turned their land into pasture. The
cottiers were driven to the mountains of Kerry and Connaught, whence they wandered in the summer in search of
work to pay their rents. There were few factories to take
away the people from the land. The English Parliament,
moved by the English merchants, who were afraid of Irish
competition, had put down the Irish woollen trade. The
Navigation Acts still crippled Irish commerce, and the
linen-trade of Ulster was of itselfnot enough to give work to
the landless poor. There was a large number of Protestant
emigrants, but few Catholics now left their native land.</p>
  <p>3. <note place="foot" n="3">Grievances of the Protestants.</note>The Irish Protestants were not without their grievances. The Presbyterians settled in Ulster were shut by a
Test Act out of all offices under the Crown,
though they had in the Regium Donum a small
State endowment for their Church, and their common
interests with the Established Church as a Protestant minority made their position much better than that of English
Dissenters. But all Irish Protestants bitterly resented the
ascendency which England had over all Irish affairs.
Poynings' Act, passed in the reign of Henry VII., and
strengthened by a Declaratory Act of <persName key="George I.">George I.</persName>, provided
that no law should be brought forward in the Irish Parliament until it had been approved by the English Privy
Council. The English Parliament constantly passed laws
binding on Ireland; for example, the Act which finally
put down the woollen trade, from which the wealthy Pro

<pb id="p.123" n="123"/>



testants of course suffered most. Most of the revenue of
the Crown in Ireland was hereditary, and outside the control of the Irish Parliament. The Irish Parliament was in
some ways in greater need of reform than the English.
More than half its members were returned by proprietors of
boroughs. There was no Septennial Act, Mutiny Act, or
Habeas Corpus Act.   <persName key="George II.">George II.</persName>'s Parliament sat all
through his reign without re-election.</p>
  <p>The chief posts in Church and State were always given
to Englishmen. Friends of the Government who were too
bad to be helped in England got pensions and places in
Ireland. The Established Church was used as a political
means of upholding the English connection, and did its
spiritual work so badly that the poorer Protestants got little
good from it. Dean <persName key="Swift, Jonathan">Swift</persName> speaks with bitter scorn of the
way in which Church patronage was abused. <quote>"Excellent
and moral men have been selected on every vacancy. But
it unfortunately has uniformly happened that as these
worthy divines crossed Hounslow Heath to take possession
of their bishoprics, they have been regularly robbed and
murdered by the highwaymen frequenting that common,
who seized upon their robes and patents, come over to
Ireland, and are consecrated bishops in their stead."</quote> <quote>"A
true Irish bishop,"</quote> says one of their own order, <quote>"has
nothing more to do than to eat, drink, grow fat, rich, and
die."</quote> Yet of one important district it was said : <quote>" In many
parishes the churches are wholly demolished, and several
clergymen have each of them four or five. They commonly
live in Dublin, leaving the conduct of their Popish parishioners to priests of their own persuasion."</quote></p>
   <p>4. <note place="foot" n="4">Better aspects of Irish Society.</note>There were brighter sides to Irish life. Neighbourly
 good feeling often prevented Protestants from putting the
 Penal Code into force. There was often kindly
 fellowship even between landlords and tenants,
 for the worst oppressors were not so much the
 large landowners as greedy middlemen of low rank, often
 Catholics, and as ignorant as the peasantry they ground
 down. With all their poverty <persName key="Young, Arthur">Arthur Young</persName> found the <quote>"common Irish voluble, cheerful, and lively ; as spiritedly active

Berkeley, the great philosopher, was Bishop of Cloyne.
Francis Hutcheson, the founder of the <soCalled>"Scotch "</soCalled> philosophy,
was an Irish Presbyterian. <persName key="Burke, Edmund">Burke</persName>, the wisest of Whig
statesmen, <persName key="Goldsmith, Oliver">Goldsmith</persName>, poet and novelist, and <persName key="Sterne, Lawrence">Sterne</persName>, the
humorist, all came from Ireland.  In <date value="1731">1731</date> the Dublin
Society was established to promote the arts, manufactures,
and husbandry of Ireland.</p>
   <p>Dublin was still the second city in the empire, with about
 120,000 inhabitants. Its Parliament House, Four Courts,
 and other public buildings, were magnificent, and its Uni versity was, in Chesterfield's opinion, better than those of
 England. The agreeable and hearty society of Dublin was
 contrasted strongly by <persName key="Young, Arthur">Arthur Young</persName> with the brutality and
 recklessness of <quote>"the little country gentlemen, your fellows
 with round hats edged with gold, who hunt in the day,
 get drunk in the evening, and fight the next morning."</quote>
 <persName key="Handel, Frederick">Handel</persName> chose to bring out his Messiah in Dublin rather
 than in London. The theatres were as good as those of
 London itself. Belfast was, says Young, <quote>" a well-built town
 of brick, lively and busy, with 15,000 inhabitants."</quote> Cork had
 a population of 70,000.</p>
 <p>5. <note place="foot" n="5">The System of Irish Government.</note>The local government of Ireland was carried on by
 the grand juries of gentry, who had much the same powers
 as quarter sessions in England. The central
 government was in the hands of the Lord
 Lieutenant, his Chief Secretary, the Irish Privy
 Council, and the permanent officials that collectively made
 up Dublin Castle, though all were subject to the control of
 the English cabinet. But the Lord Lieutenant, always a
 great English nobleman, only lived in Ireland during the
 short sessions of the Irish Parliament every other year.
 When he was away his place was filled by Lords Justices,
 who were generally great ecclesiastics like Primates Boulter
 and Stone, or the chief owners of Irish boroughs, such
 as the Ponsonbys and the Beresfords, who, in return for
 a large share of patronage, undertook to carry on the
 king's business, and were therefore called Undertakers.
 Hence there was for a long time hardly any opposition in
 the Irish Parliament to Government measures.</p>
 <p>6. There was a strong and growing disgust at the English
 Government and their Irish agents. The Catholics at first
had no share in this. Even in <date value="1715">1715</date> and <date value="1745">1745</date> the Jacobite

  <p>In <date value="1722">1722</date> an attempt to reform the copper coinage of
Ireland caused a great outburst of feeling. There was no
mint in Ireland, and it had been the custom to grant
patents to private people, allowing them to issue the necessary coins. An English ironmaster named William Wood
got a contract to coin  &#x00A3; 10,000 worth from <persName key="George I.">George I.</persName>'s mistress, the Duchess of Kendal. The half-pence Wood issued
were good weight, and better than the old coins; but many
Irishmen believed that there was a scheme to drain the
country of its gold and silver, and leave it nothing but a
debased copper currency. In <date value="1724">1724</date> Dean <persName key="Swift, Jonathan">Swift</persName> lashed the
nation into fury against the Government in his brilliant

  follow American methods to get their grievances removed.
  A young orator, <persName key="Grattan, Henry">Henry Grattan</persName>, now became the Irish
  Chatham. On the pretext of warding off invasion, bands
  of volunteers were enrolled among the Protestants. The
  brave and ardent Lord Charlemont put himself at their
  head, and by the end of <date value="1779">1779</date> they were 50,000 strong. The

the Crown. <quote>"<persName key="Grattan, Henry">Grattan</persName>'s Parliament"</quote> was as
supreme and omnipotent as the chambers at
Westminster. But the administration of Ireland
remained in English hands, and was made secondary to
English objects. Hence the great object of Lords-Lieutenant
and their Chief Secretaries was to get together a Parliament
which would <quote>"support the English Government."</quote> <persName key="Flood, Henry">Flood</persName>
and Charlemont were not satisfied so long as this was possible, and a Volunteer Convention met in Dublin to support
<persName key="Flood, Henry">Flood</persName>'s proposal of parliamentary reform. A claimant for
the leadership of the extreme party was found in Frederick
Hervey, Earl of Bristol and bishop of the rich see of <placeName key="Derry">Derry</placeName>.
He was a man of strange and eccentric character, <quote>"full of
spirits and talk, and displaying the self-complacency of a
French marshal rather than the grave deportment of a
prelate."</quote><quote> "We must have blood,"</quote> was his cry before the
Convention.  But the Irish Parliament refused to be
coerced ; <persName key="Grattan, Henry">Grattan</persName> himself voted with the Government.</p>
  <p>The Catholic question now dissolved the remnant of
power of the Volunteers. <persName key="Flood, Henry">Flood</persName> and Charlemont were willing to repeal the Penal Code, but would give no military or
legislative power to the Catholics, for they saw that this
would <quote>"totally break the connection with England, and
make Ireland a Catholic country." </quote>Their political ideal was
a free Protestant aristocracy independent of England, and
treating kindly its Catholic dependants.  <persName key="Grattan, Henry">Grattan</persName> would,
however, have gladly seen the Catholic gentry in Parliament, and in this <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> agreed with him. <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> also wished
to throw open to Irish traders the whole commerce of
England, receiving in return some contribution from Ireland to the general expenses of the empire. But, in <date value="1785">1785</date>,
this scheme failed through the jealousies of English traders
and the touchiness of the Irish Parliament. For the next
few years the government of Ireland remained in English
hands, and a system of bribery and jobbery grew up by
which the Government maintained a majority in the unreformed Irish Parliament. Yet under the new constitution
Ireland grew richer and more prosperous.  Dublin was
adorned with more magnificent public buildings. A bounty
on exported corn counteracted the old tendency towards
pasture, and made Ireland again an arable country. The
linen trade rapidly increased. The Penal Code was bit by

  bit repealed. But nothing was done to grapple with the
  deeper evils which the land system continued to produce.
  The population grew, and the cottiers' position did not
  improve. The Irish Parliament was full of eloquence, but
  it had a strong dislike to do too much.</p>

  welcomed by the Presbyterians of the north, and the
  Free-thinkers in the great towns.  Theobald
  Wolfe <persName key="Tone, Theobald Wolfe">Tone</persName>, a daring and zealous young
  Protestant lawyer, started in <date value="1791">1791</date> the first
  Society of United Irishmen.  Its professed

  to clamour for parliamentary reform, and complete Catholic
  emancipation. But <persName key="Tone, Theobald Wolfe">Tone</persName> looked on all this as a means
<quote>  "to subvert the tyranny of our execrable government,

    <p>11. <note place="foot" n="11">Catholic Emancipation and Parliamentary Reform</note>Between the revolutionaries and the bigots stood
 the Catholic party, representing the mass of Irishmen.
 The Catholics had had since <date value="1782">1782</date> a Central
 Committee at Dublin to look after their interests.
 Their position was a strong one, as <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName>
 sympathised with them, and the United Irish bade
heavily for their help.  The educated Catholics looked
to the Government for support, while the ignorant masses
fell blindly into the plans of the United Irishmen. The
confusion was increased by the want of settled policy of the
Government, where the liberal instincts of <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName>, and the prejudices of strong Protestants, like <persName key="Fitzgibbon, John">Fitzgibbon</persName>, afterwards
Lord <persName key="Clare, John FitzGibbon, Earl of">Clare</persName>, the Irish Chancellor, asserted themselves in
turn.  In <date value="1793">1793</date> the Irish Parliament was forced by the
Government to pass a great Catholic Relief Act, which gave


<pb id="p.129" n="129"/>




Catholics the franchise without the right of being returned
members. This made it still harder to get Parliamentary
Reform, because it was now seen that the Protestant ascendency depended on keeping up the rotten boroughs. In
<date value="1794">1794</date> the Whig Lord-Lieutenant, Lord Fitzwilliam, an
engaging and attractive man, tried and failed in his policy
of conciliation. He turned out the notorious Beresford from
a commissionership of the revenue, and frightened every
jobber and place-hunter in Ireland. Fitzgibbon now persuaded the king that he would break his coronation oath if
he let Catholics sit in Parliament. As a result <persName key="Grattan, Henry">Grattan</persName>'s
Reform Bill was rejected; and Fitzwilliam was superseded
by Lord Camden. The Catholic Committee dissolved
itself, and the United Irishmen prepared for a revolution.</p>

and arranged with the French general, Lazare Hoche,

little came from  this. But the popularity of the rebel
leaders with the peasantry soon turned the northern Protestants on to the side of the Government, and when the war
broke out in <date value="1798">1798</date> it was a regular religious war of
Protestant and Catholic.</p>
  <p>The Government showed great vigour, and a stern but
almost necessary cruelty in disarming the disaffected
peasantry. Unluckily the lack of regular troops forced it
to allow a Protestant yeomanry to be established, which
took advantage of the chance to wreak its hatred on the
wretched Catholics. General Lake disarmed Ulster and
prevented a rising there, and the prompt arrest of Lord
Edward and other leaders deprived the rising of its heads.
In May <date value="1798">1798</date> the rebellion broke out in Leinster.  The
attempt to raise the neighbourhood of Dublin proved a
failure, but in Wexford a great army of peasants assembled
under the leadership of some helpless local leaders and one
or two zealot priests. For some time they commanded the
country, and worked much cruel revenge on many of their
Protestant tyrants; but they were badly armed and led,
and could not hold their own against regular troops. Lake
stormed their fortified camp on Vinegar Hill, near Enniscorthy, and the rebel army broke up into small bands,
which bit by bit melted away.</p>
   <p>It was now the turn of the yeomanry to avenge the crimes
 of the rebels by misdeeds equally wanton and hideous.

Killala in Connaught, very few joined him, and though he
easily put the militia to flight at Castlebar Races, he soon
surrendered.</p>

formerly general of the English army in America, succeeded Lord Camden as Lord-Lieutenant. He did his best
to prevent the two races from flying at each
other's throats.  Like <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> he believed that
Ireland could only be justly ruled by men free from the
prejudices of Irish parties, held that the rebellion had
proved the failure of the government of the Protestant
minority, and considered the true solution of the difficulty
to be the Parliamentary Union of England and Ireland.
With a united Parliament Catholic emancipation would be
easier, as there would be no danger of Catholic ascendency.
It was even hoped that some sort of State support could
be found for the Catholic clergy, whose hatred of Jacobinism had made them, as a class, loyal during the rebellion.
To the Catholics such a union would have been welcome,
but the ruling Protestants were violently opposed to it as
destructive of all their privileges. In the session of <date value="1799">1799</date>

The chief supporters of the Union were Lord <persName key="Castlereagh, Lord">Castlereagh</persName>,

Plunket, were all violent against it.  <quote>"I will resist it,"</quote>
cried Plunket, <quote>"to the last gasp of my existence and
with the last drop of my blood, and when I feel the
hour of my dissolution approaching, I will, like the father
of Hannibal, take my children to the altar and swear
them to eternal hostility against the invaders of their country's freedom."</quote> But Ponsonby's resolution pledging the
House to <quote>"maintain the undoubted birthright of Ireland,
an independent Parliament,"</quote> was withdrawn. During the
recess a good deal was done towards winning over opinion
and votes. The non-represented Protestants were lukewarm; the Catholics were hopeful, and direct or indirect Government corruption won over the boroughowners, the lawyers, and the Dublin tradesmen. In vain
<persName key="Grattan, Henry">Grattan</persName>, who had not been in Parliament for several years,
bought a seat, and appeared in the dress of the old Volunteers to thunder against the scheme. The Act of Union

old-fashioned armies of the despots of Europe, and was still
welcomed, though with less zeal, as the apostle of Revolutionary France. But the English first taught the conqueror

clearing off the sea the chief commercial navies of Europe,

America.  So strong was she at sea, that she could do
much more harm to the Continent than it could to her. All

save that city from capture. On 16th June <persName key="Napoleon">Napoleon</persName> drove back the
Prussians, who held the left wing, at Ligny, but his
attack on the English outposts at Quatre Bras failed.
But the retreat of the Prussians forced <persName key="Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke">Wellington</persName> to retire also, and
Blucher, who was not at all badly beaten, deceived the 30,000 French
under Grouchy, who were seeking him in the East, by retreating northwards to Wavre. On 18th June <persName key="Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke">Wellington</persName> took up his station on a
low ridge running east and west, about two miles south of the little
town of Waterloo, and immediately before the village of Mont St. Jean.
The country house of Hougomont protected his right, a farm called
La Haye Sainte was at his centre, and others called Papelotte and La
Haye, covered his left. The French drew up opposite, with their centre
at the small village of Planchenoit. The numbers were about equal,
perhaps 70,000 men a-side; but <persName key="Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke">Wellington</persName>'s army consisted of
raw English recruits and of Netherlandish conscripts that would have
gladly been fighting for <persName key="Napoleon">Napoleon</persName>. The French, to whom time was
everything, began the battle by a desperate assault on Hougomont,
which was gallantly and successfully resisted by the garrison of English
Guards and Germans. Though meant as a mere feint, this attack made
Hougomont a chief centre of the fighting. But the main struggle was
at the allies' centre. <quote>" Never did I see,"</quote> wrote <persName key="Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke">Wellington</persName> to Beresford, <quote>"such a pounding match. Both were what the boxers call

English line stood firm, though La Haye Sainte was abandoned, and
the weakened left was in a critical position. But the Prussians, after a
heavy march over muddy roads, were now arriving from Wavre. The
last desperate charge of the reserves of the Imperial Guard failed, and
the whole line of the French was broken, and at once plunged into a
panic-stricken retreat. Gneisenau followed up the pursuit, and effectually scattered the remains of <persName key="Napoleon">Napoleon</persName>'s last army. The game was
now up. On 7th July Paris was again occupied, and the defeated
Emperor took refuge in an English man-of-war. He spent the rest of
his life on the barren rock of St. Helena, dictating lies and slanders to
his attendants to justify his career.</quote>

<p>THE two strongest political forces of the nineteenth century
are Nationality and Democracy.</p>
  <p>After <date value="1815">1815</date> the Holy Alliance was formed by the restored
despots of Europe, to protect themselves against these two
great principles upheld by the Liberals of the Continent.
The chief event of the history of the century is the gradual
triumph of the national and popular cause.</p>
  <p>At first Nationality and Democracy were closely bound
together, and suspected of leading to revolution, infidelity,
and anarchy. The Liberal movements of <date value="1830">1830</date> and <date value="1848">1848</date>
failed because of this combination.</p>
  <p>Sensible men gradually came to see that the first principle
to be asserted was that of Nationality. When the national
cause was no longer revolutionary, strong kings were found
to put themselves at the head of it. The house of Savoy
now set up a united Italy, and the house of Brandenburg a united Germany. England, France, and Russia
were already nations as well as states. At last the house of
Austria did what it could in this direction, by giving self-
government to some of the many nations of which its
empire is composed. The national principle has even
spread to the Balkan Peninsula as the only way of solving
the problems presented by the decay of Turkey. But the
new national states became for the most part strong centralised monarchies, though with enough of a popular and
constitutional element about them to show their origin.
But the settlement of the form of government now became
a home question for each.</p>
   <p>In England there was little need to vindicate the national
principle; and from the time of <persName key="Canning, George">Canning</persName> England's general



<pb id="p.152" n="152"/>




<note place="top" n="1">[<dateRange from="1820" to="1887">1820-1887</dateRange>.]</note>



sympathy and influence has been with the national cause
on the Continent.</p>
  <p>England was therefore free for the other great principle
to work itself out. The history of England since <date value="1820">1820</date> has
been the history of the growth of popular power, of the
growth of democracy.</p>
   <p>The movement began with the establishment of religious
and commercial freedom by the liberal Tories under
<persName key="George IV.">George IV.</persName> The next step was the Reform Bill of <date value="1832">1832</date>,
and the long train of measures which followed it. The
popular movement hardly stopped when the Whigs lost
power, through their inability to govern. The new Conservatism of <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName> established free trade and cheapened the
food of the people; but in its struggle with vested interests
his party split itself up (<date value="1846">1846</date>).</p>
   <p>For the next twenty years there is a perceptible slackening in the growth of the popular cause, though much was
done to improve the people's condition and make it fit to
exercise the power it was soon to enjoy.</p>
  <p>The death of Lord <persName key="Palmerston, Henry Temple, Viscount">Palmerston</persName> (<date value="1865">1865</date>) marks the beginning
of a new forward movement.  Under the leadership of
<persName key="Gladstone, W.E.">Gladstone</persName> a whole series of sweeping reforms was brought
about by the Liberals. The Conservatives, reorganised and
inspired with new ideals by <persName key="Disraeli, Benjamin">Disraeli</persName>, were now hardly less
democratic than their rivals. The Reform Bill of <date value="1867">1867</date> was
passed by <persName key="Disraeli, Benjamin">Disraeli</persName>. The Reform Bill of <date value="1885">1885</date>, which made
England a democracy, was carried by an agreement between both the great parties.</p>
  <p>Political changes were not enough now. Men began to
expect more from the State, and to desire great economical
and social changes as well. These were just beginning to
be accomplished, when the old parties were broken up by
the adoption in <date value="1886">1886</date> by the Liberal leader of the Irish
programme. The first act of power of the enfranchised
democracy was to vindicate the unity of the empire, which,
rightly or wrongly, it believed to be in danger. But this
marks a new starting-point, and history must cease where
present controversy rages.</p>
  <p>England's progress in the nineteenth century has not
been merely political. Her wealth, commerce, and manufactures have grown enormously.  Her command of the
world's trade has become more complete, though now more
than threatened.</p>
  <p>England's moral progress has even been greater than her
material growth. Men have ceased to be satisfied with the


<pb id="p.153" n="153"/>






complacent contemplation of material prosperity, and
earnest efforts have been made to make England better,
wiser, and happier. There has been progress, though not
perhaps uninterrupted progress, in religion, morality, earnestness, and intelligence. A new way of looking at things
has grown up which is sympathetic of the past, though not
neglectful of the present. But much still remains to be
done before we can feel real satisfaction.</p></div2 >

cause. <persName key="Canning, George">Canning</persName> went out of office rather than act against
her. <persName key="Brougham, Henry">Brougham</persName>, the most prominent Whig lawyer, became
her attorney-general. Even <persName key="Wilberforce, William">Wilberforce</persName>, who <quote>"feared she

Her house was always surrounded by a <quote>"most shabby
assemblage,"</quote> that cheered the <quote>" stout lady in a large hat and
feathers,"</quote> who bowed from the window. So strong was
the feeling that the ministers dropped their bill after it had
passed its third reading in the Lords by a majority of only
nine. The queen's popularity now waned. People began
to see how unworthy she was. She failed in an undignified
attempt to get admission to <persName key="George VI.">George</persName>'s gorgeous and wasteful coronation ceremonies. The mob hissed her, and,
wearied with the struggle, she went home to die. A last
wave of enthusiasm for her caused a bloody riot when her
body was being conveyed through London on its way to its
burial-place in Germany. On her coffin she had ordered to be
written: <quote>"Here lies <persName key="Caroline of Brunswick">Caroline</persName>, the injured Queen of England."</quote></p>
  <p><persName key="George VI.">George</persName> was delighted at his wife's death, which he learnt
when on his way to Dublin, <quote>" eating goose-pie, and drinking
whisky so abundantly that when he arrived he was in the
last stage of intoxication."</quote> He made in that state a mad
speech in which he said <quote>"rank, station, and honours were
nothing, but to feel that I live in the hearts of my Irish subjects is exalted happiness."</quote>  He was wonderfully well
received, and the port from which he sailed was called
Kingstown in his honour.  He was equally welcomed in
Hanover, and next year was even more successful in a visit
to Scotland, Sir <persName key="Scott, Walter">Walter Scott</persName> taking a leading share in his
reception. But his behaviour, <quote>"like a popular candidate on
an electioneering trip,"</quote> disgusted right-thinking men. He
soon shut himself up in <quote>"the Cottage,"</quote> or in his favourite
Brighton Pavilion, a peevish, whimsical, prematurely old,
thoroughly selfish recluse, with failing health, and few friends
save his favourite Lady Conyngham and her greedy family,
and his Keeper of the Privy Purse, Sir William Knighton,
of whom he was afraid.</p>

the Spanish Constitution. The despots of the Holy Alliance
met together in conference at Troppau and Laibach, and
resolved that <quote>"useful or necessary changes in legislation and

the free-will and weighed conviction of those whom God has
rendered responsible for power,"</quote> that is, from the kings
alone. So they sent Austrian troops to restore despotism

He was just going off to another congress at Verona, when

He sent <persName key="Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke">Wellington</persName> to Verona, with <quote>"frank and peremptory

the Hellenic cause, but more desire for Russian aggrandisement. About the same time Mehemet Ali, Pasha of Egypt,
sent his son Ibrahim Pasha with a well-drilled army to help
his suzerain the Sultan. In despair the Greeks implored the
protection of England, and <persName key="Canning, George">Canning</persName> signed on 6th July
<date value="1827">1827</date> the Treaty of London, by which England and Russia
pledged themselves to offer their mediation, and insist on a
truce. Vague orders were sent to Sir Edward Codrington,
who commanded the Mediterranean fleet, and he was told
that if necessary he might enforce the armistice by cannon
shot, <quote>"although the measure is not to be adopted in a hostile
spirit."</quote></p>
  <p>Ibrahim Pasha had just been joined by an Egyptian
squadron, now anchored in the bay of Navarino, the ancient
Pylos. Codrington was now joined by the Russian and
French squadrons, and persuaded Ibrahim to accept a truce
of twenty days. But the Pasha, furious on hearing that

horrible barbarities in the Morea. On 20th October <date value="1827">1827</date>

truce, and, almost by chance, the Turks fired on an English
ship's boat, and brought about a general action.  The
Turkish fleet was altogether destroyed. <quote>" Out of a fleet of

Irish Catholics had hoped that <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName>'s Union would free them
from the rule of the Protestant minority, and prepare the way for their admission to Parliament
and office. But the bigotry and obstinacy of
<persName key="George III.">George III.</persName> had put off Catholic emancipation, and Dublin
Castle was still practically controlled by the Orange faction.
So the Union proved a severe disappointment to them.
The wretched land system left the condition of the rapidly
increasing millions of poor Irishmen as miserable as ever,
and outrages, cattle-houghing, and murders went on worse
than before. After <date value="1810">1810</date> the followers of <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> were free to
raise the Catholic question again, and from <date value="1812">1812</date> onwards
Catholic emancipation was an <quote>"open question"</quote> in every

and the eloquent <persName key="Grattan, Henry">Grattan</persName> now pleaded for it in the united
Parliament. <persName key="Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke">Wellington</persName>, <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName>, and the high Tories led the
opposition. Yet several times the Commons passed Catholic
relief bills, which were thrown out by the Lords. The
Marquess Wellesley, <persName key="Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke">Wellington</persName>'s elder brother, had been
sent to Ireland in <date value="1821">1821</date> as a Liberal Lord-Lieutenant, but
his idleness and pompous Eastern ways made him quite
unfitted for the post, and even <persName key="Canning, George">Canning</persName> laughed when he
believed that a riot at a theatre in which a quart bottle
was thrown at his box was a deliberate attempt to murder
him. But Wellesley had the courage to quarrel with the
Orange faction, though all his liberality would not conciliate
the Catholics.</p>

   <p>In <date value="1823">1823</date> the Catholic Association was formed, and col lected a Catholic rent. The founder was Daniel <persName key="O'Connell, Daniel">O'Connell</persName>,
 the greatest and most national of Irish agitators, a Catholic,
 a Celt, a country gentleman of large property and good
 family, the first man at the Irish bar, and a speaker with
 extraordinary powers of stirring the emotions and ruling the
 hearts of his countrymen, brilliant and incisive, though
 coarse, violent, and unscrupulous. He now became absolute
 master of Ireland. At his bidding all crime and outrage
 ceased, and the people agitated in a lawful way. They
 held monster meetings, and the Protestants of the north
 became alarmed at their quiet determination. The weak
 and divided Government at last ventured to put down
 the Association (<date value="1825">1825</date>), but a new Association was at once
 started <quote>"for the purposes of education and charity,"</quote> and
 went on much as before.  In <date value="1826">1826</date> there was a general
 election, and <persName key="O'Connell, Daniel">O'Connell</persName>'s candidate in Waterford county
 easily defeated the Beresfords, though hitherto the forty shilling <quote>"freeholders"</quote> had flocked to the poll like sheep to
 vote for their landlords. In <date value="1828">1828</date> <persName key="O'Connell, Daniel">O'Connell</persName> became himself
 a candidate for County Clare against Vesey Fitzgerald, a
 popular Irish landlord and friend of the Catholic claims.
 The <quote>"forties"</quote> followed their priests, and returned <persName key="O'Connell, Daniel">O'Connell</persName>
 by an enormous majority, though as a Catholic he could not
 take his seat.</p>
 	<p>Civil war was now nearly breaking out, as was shown
 when the audacious Lawless attempted an agitation tour in
 Ulster. <quote>"Yet the Government,"</quote> said the Irish orator Sheil,
 <quote>"folded their arms and sat inactive as if two gladiators were
 crossing their swords for their recreation."</quote> Lord Anglesey,
 the well-meaning but weak Lord-Lieutenant, was at last dismissed for telling <persName key="O'Connell, Daniel">O'Connell</persName> that he differed from the Duke.
 But the prospect of half the counties of Ireland turning out
 their Tory landlords for nominees of <persName key="O'Connell, Daniel">O'Connell</persName> at the next
 election convinced Government that it could no longer
 resist. <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName>'s clear good sense now got the better of his

 was outflanked, hastened to entrench the Tory army in a

 <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName> proposed that the Association should be put down, that

the no-popery feeling run that <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName> thought himself lucky to

mature age of sixty-five, and was so excited by his exaltation,
that he nearly went mad, and distinguished
himself by a thousand eccentricities of language
and conduct, though he afterwards sobered down."</quote> But
<quote>"he was a good-natured, kind-hearted, and well-meaning
man, and he always acted an honourable and straightforward, if not always a sound and discreet part." " His simplicity and affability were very striking," and he "looked
like a respectable old admiral."</quote> Queen Adelaide was <quote>" very
ugly, with a horrid complexion, but good manners."</quote> William was popular, and a reformer, but he worked very
cordially with the <persName key="Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke">Wellington</persName> Government, though the Duke
had turned him out of the High Admiralship in <date value="1828">1828</date>.</p>
  <p>2. <note place="foot" n="2">Revolutions on the Continent, <date value="1830">1830</date>.</note>A wave of revolution now spread over Europe. Charles
X. of France and Polignac tried to put down the liberty of
the press. The Paris mob rose in revolution,
and in the street battles of the <quote>" three glorious
days of July"</quote> drove out Charles, and made
Louis Philippe, Duke of Orleans, the <quote>" citizen"</quote> king of the
French, with a constitution of the English sort. Belgium
turned out the Dutch King of the Netherlands.  German

Poland rose against Russia. The work of the Holy Alliance
was everywhere crumbling to pieces.</p>
  <p>3. <note place="foot" n="3">Revival of the Reform Agitation, <date value="1830">1830</date>.</note>In England the Liberal movement took the form of a
new cry for Reform of Parliament. Ever since the Revolution of <date value="1688">1688</date> the bad constitution of Parliament
had made itself felt. Each English shire,
great or small, returned two members, and
none but the freeholders had votes. Many of the boroughs,
sending two members apiece to the House, were wretched
villages or, like Gatton and Old Sarum, had hardly any
inhabitants at all, and the representatives of even the larger
boroughs were in many cases chosen by a close corporation, or by a narrow and corrupt electorate. Seats in Parliament could be bought, and many members sat as the
nominees of great lords. Scotland was hardly represented
at all, so narrow was the franchise there. The new towns

of northern England had as a rule no members, so that
after the Industrial Revolution the need of Reform was
greater than ever. Early in <persName key="George III.">George III.</persName>'s reign Chatham
had declared <quote>"that the small boroughs were the rotten
part of the constitution, but though the limb is mortified,
amputation might be death. A gentler remedy is to be
found in giving a new member for each shire, for the knights
of the shire approach nearest the constitutional representation of the country, because they represent the soil."</quote>
Junius maintained that <quote>"if any part of the representative
body be not chosen by the people, that part vitiates and
corrupts the whole."</quote> Even <persName key="Burke, Edmund">Burke</persName> (who revered the constitution as a living sacred thing, to tamper with which
would destroy it and bring about anarchy) recognised that
<quote>" the great subject of apprehension and redress now was the
distemper of Parliament."</quote> <persName key="Pitt, William">William Pitt</persName>, when he first
entered Parliament, brought forward a Reform Bill, and
was well supported, though after he became minister he
accepted his defeats as final. But in Ireland there had been
a Reform Agitation of the most vigorous kind, even after the
French Revolution had frightened <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> into reaction, and
the Union brought about a wholesale disfranchisement of
Irish rotten boroughs, without any of the fearful results
expected.</p>
  <p>Charles Grey brought forward motions in favour of Reform
on three occasions, though he never met with much support.
Gradually the Whig party took up the question, and, after
Grey went to the Lords, <persName key="Brougham, Henry">Brougham</persName> and Lord John <persName key="Russell, John">Russell</persName>
(son of the Duke of Bedford) took his place. Out of doors
the Radicals were all zealous Reformers. Even after <date value="1822">1822</date>,
when <persName key="Canning, George">Canning</persName> and <persName key="Huskisson, William">Huskisson</persName> had turned attention to other
channels, the movement was carried on by singling out
specially corrupt boroughs and insisting on their losing
their members. Thus Grampound in Cornwall was disfranchised, and its members given to Yorkshire, as the
Tories would not allow them to Leeds.  In <date value="1828">1828</date> the question whether the members for East Retford should go to
Birmingham or to the hundred of Bassetlaw (the surrounding district) caused the breach between <persName key="Huskisson, William">Huskisson</persName> and
the ministry of <persName key="Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke">Wellington</persName>. In opposition the Canningites
forgot their old leader's hatred of Reform. <persName key="Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke">Wellington</persName> even
thought to make up for his quarrel with the Protestant
Tories by negotiations with <persName key="Huskisson, William">Huskisson</persName>. But <persName key="Huskisson, William">Huskisson</persName>
was killed at the opening of the <placeName key="Liverpool">Liverpool</placeName> and <placeName key="Manchester">Manchester</placeName>
railway, and his death made it easier for the Canningites

to become absorbed among the Whigs. The popular cry
for Reform rose higher. Suffering artisans believed that
a reformed Parliament would mean more work and higher
wages, and the unrepresented middle classes of the North
and the great towns clamoured eagerly for it. A political
Union of Reformers was formed at Birmingham by the
zealous Attwood, and similar associations spread over
England.  The general election after William's accession destroyed the Government majority, and the popular
boroughs and the counties (whose voice then had immense
weight as evidence of public opinion) sent up Reformers.
The blind hatred of the old-Tories to the Government which
had betrayed them made these changes easier.</p>
  <p>4. <note place="foot" n="4">The Grey Ministry, <dateRange from="1830" to="1834">1830-34</dateRange>.</note><persName key="Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke">Wellington</persName> thought he saw a revolution coming, and
declared that the present system was perfect, and that he
would always resist its alteration. The feeling
against him rose high, and on 15th November
<date value="1830">1830</date> the Government resigned after a defeat
on Sir Henry <persName key="Parnell, Henry">Parnell</persName>'s motion for a select committee
on the civil list.</p>
  <p>William IV. now sent for Earl Grey, who formed a strong
reforming Cabinet. The veteran Lord Lansdowne was
President of the Council; the restless and turbulent
<persName key="Brougham, Henry">Brougham</persName> was made Chancellor and a baron; and the
Radicals were pleased by Lord Durham, Grey's son-in-law,
becoming Privy Seal. Lord Althorp, son of Lord Spencer,
led the House of Commons as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
He was a <quote>"short, thick-set man, with a dark red complexion, black hair, very ordinary and farmer-like style of
dress, and no particular vivacity of countenance."</quote> His
<quote>" remarkable bonhomie,"</quote> says Greville, <quote>"his unalterable good
nature and good temper, the conviction of his honesty and
sincerity, and of his want of ambition, single-mindedness,
and unfeigned desire to get out of the cares of office, have
procured him a greater personal regard and greater influence than any minister I recollect."</quote> But he had more of
the sportsman and country gentleman than the statesman
about him, and was <quote>"sluggish, inert, vacillating, unforeseeing."</quote>  In the other posts the Canningites mustered
strong, including <persName key="Palmerston, Henry Temple, Viscount">Palmerston</persName> as Foreign Secretary, <persName key="Melbourne, William Lamb, Lord">Melbourne</persName> (William <persName key="Lamb, William">Lamb</persName>) as Home Secretary, and Goderich
as Colonial Secretary. Lord John <persName key="Russell, John">Russell</persName> was Paymaster,
though not in the Cabinet; the brilliant orator <persName key="Stanley, Edward, 14th Earl of Derby">Stanley</persName> was
Irish Secretary, and Sir James Graham First Lord of the
Admiralty.</p>

a Reform Bill which, on 21st March, passed its second
reading by one vote, and came to grief in committee. The ministers forced the king to dissolve. At the new elections the Reformers made a clean
sweep of the counties, and by September a new Reform
Bill had got through the Commons by more than a hundred
majority. It was thrown out by the Lords on 8th October,
and fierce riots raged all over the country, of which the
worst was at Bristol.  In March <date value="1832">1832</date> Lord John carried a
third bill through the Commons, which, through the action
of Lord Harrowby and the <quote>" waverers,"</quote> was read a second
time in the Lords by a majority of nine; but, on 7th May,
Lyndhurst carried against the Government a resolution
postponing the disfranchising clauses.</note></p>
  <p>The agitation was now terrible. The people had cried
out for <quote>"the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill,"</quote> and its
most vital part was in danger. The Birmingham Union
resolved to march 200,000 strong to London, and petitions
were signed that no supplies should be granted till the Bill
was passed. Grey pressed William to make enough new
peers to carry the Bill, but the king refused, worked upon
by the queen and the Tory ladies at Court. The ministry
resigned, and <persName key="Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke">Wellington</persName> boldly undertook to form another.
But <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName> wisely held aloof, thinking that a Tory Reform
Bill, after Tory Catholic emancipation, would destroy his
reputation; and the Duke, who saw that any minister would
have to pass some sort of Reform Bill, gave up his attempt.
To prevent the wholesale creation of new peers, <persName key="Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke">Wellington</persName>
and a large number of lords withdrew, and on 4th June <date value="1832">1832</date>
the Reform Bill was finally carried. Its provisions were-</p>

<quote rend="blockquote">(a) All boroughs, 56 in number, with less than 2000 inhabitants,
were entirely disfranchised (Schedule A). (b) All boroughs with between 2000 and 4000 inhabitants were cut down to one member
(Schedule B). (c) The 143 seats thus vacant were given to (1) the
larger counties, some of which were broken up into two or even three
divisions, each returning two members; (2) the unrepresented
boroughs, including <placeName key="Manchester">Manchester</placeName>, Birmingham, Leeds, and other great
manufacturing towns, several boroughs in London (Tower Hamlets,
Finsbury, Marylebone, Lambeth, and Greenwich), which had two
members each, and 21 smaller but still considerable places which
returned one member. (d) The county franchise was enlarged by
adding copyholders and leaseholders, and  &#x00A3; 50 tenants-at-will (Chandos clause) to the freeholders. (e) The irregularities of the borough
franchise were abolished, many electors in the freer towns lost their
votes, and a new uniform qualification of occupation of a house of &#x00A3;10
a year, ratable value, was substituted, resident freemen created before

<date value="1831">1831</date> being allowed to keep their votes. (f) The duration of a county
election was reduced to two days (instead of fifteen), and of borough
elections to one. (g) Scotland received eight new members, taken from
England, and holders, even by a long lease, of land or houses worth
&#x00A3;10, and tenants-at-will paying &#x00A3;50 a year, were enfranchised. The
borough franchise was as in England. (h) Ireland got five new borough
members, but the forty-shilling freeholders remained disfranchised.</quote>

  <p>The Tories rightly described the Reform Bill as a revolution, though it was a long time before its full effects were
felt. It dethroned the landed aristocracy, who, since <date value="1688">1688</date>,
had practically governed the country, and transferred the
balance of power to the middle classes, for the new qualifications generally allowed the farmers to return the county
members, and the shopkeepers those for the boroughs.
Very few working-men could now get a vote, and those who
had one already in places like Westminster or Preston lost
it. But though the Reform Bill did not bring in democracy,
it prepared the way for it. Vainly the Whigs protested
that it was a final measure.  It was only a stepping-stone
to further changes. But it was at the time a sensible and
practical compromise between the old Constitution and
the mere representation of numbers, which the Radicals
favoured.</p>

older, more active, more talkative, and more
hard-working than the old ones. <quote>"The first thing
that strikes one,"</quote> says Greville, <quote>" is its inferiority
to preceding Houses of Commons, and the presumption, impertinence, and self-sufficiency of the new
members."</quote>    But Greville belonged to the old governing
class. <quote>" There exists no party but that of the Government;

result of the new energy which the Reform Bill had produced. The first question was, as usual, Ireland, which <persName key="O'Connell, Daniel">O'Connell</persName> had set on fire by his

Protestant Church. All sorts of outrages were committed;
and the clergy were often starving, for the collection of
tithe had now become quite impossible. The Government
advanced money to the Irish clergy, and tried to collect
the tithes itself, but put off the final settlement of the question, and passed a Coercion Act.  But in February <date value="1833">1833</date>
Althorp had brought forward the Church Temporalities
(Ireland) Act, which cut down the number and incomes of
the Irish bishoprics, and included an Appropriation Clause.
which directed that the surplus moneys should be devoted
to any purpose that Parliament might direct. This was,
however, given up because of the strong feeling against
turning Church money to other than Church purposes.
Crime rapidly diminished after the Coercion Act was passed,
but the disturbances were soon revived. It was not until
<date value="1838">1838</date> that a final Irish Tithe Commutation Act was passed,
which turned the claim of a tenth of the produce into a
fixed rent-charge.  Before that several Tithe Bills had
failed, owing to the Appropriation Clause. But in <date value="1836">1836</date>
tithes in England were commuted into a rent-charge, fixed
yearly by the average price of corn for the seven preceding
years. Several other attempts to reform the Church were

established, which put an end to many abuses and inequalities.</p>
  <p>8. <note place="foot" n="8">Abolition of Slavery, <date value="1833">1833</date>.</note>In the same session the slave question came up again.
The slave-trade had almost died out since <persName key="Brougham, Henry">Brougham</persName> had
made the Act of <date value="1807">1807</date> effectual by another Act
which made it felony, and in <date value="1823">1823</date> <persName key="Canning, George">Canning</persName> had
carried some resolutions paving the way for the gradual
abolition of slavery itself; but the jealousy of the planters,
and the mutinous spirit of the slaves, had made them of
little real use.  The reforming Parliament was strongly
abolitionist, and though Althorp had wished to carry out
<persName key="Canning, George">Canning</persName>'s plan of gradual emancipation, the anti-slavery
party, headed by Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, pressed for a
more sweeping measure. In August <date value="1833">1833</date> <persName key="Stanley, Edward, 14th Earl of Derby">Stanley</persName>, now
Colonial Secretary, carried the Emancipation Act.</p>
  <p>It provided that all slaves should be free after <date value="1834">1834</date>, and children
under six free at once. The rest were to work as apprentices for
twelve years, giving three-quarters of their time for nothing, but this
system was given up after four years. The planters were awarded
&#x00A3;20,000,000 as compensation.</p>

  <p>9. The reformed Parliament passed some useful minor

reforms; renewed the Bank Charter, and made bank-notes
legal tender; and revised the Charter of the East <placeName key="India">India</placeName>
Company, so as to make the Company entirely
a political body, and throw open <placeName key="India">India</placeName>n trade. <note place="foot" n="9">New Poor Law, <date value="1834">1834</date>.</note>
Its next great measure was the New Poor Law of <date value="1834">1834</date>,
which ended the degrading system of Poor Law doles in
aid of wages, and modified the Law of Settlement, which
had prevented labourers from taking their labour to the best
market. It also put an end to the careless administration
of the old Poor Law by the smaller parishes, and established
Unions of several parishes, with a single workhouse big
enough to be managed well, and governed by popularly
elected Guardians of the Poor. It made a distinction
between the idle and the destitute, and forbade outdoor
relief to the able-bodied, who refused to go into the workhouse. It cut down the crushing burden of the poor-rate,
which in some country parishes had risen so high that
men had ceased to till the soil. It probably did more to
improve the condition of the people than any other single
measure of the time.</p>
  <p>10. <note place="foot" n="10">Municipal Reform, <date value="1835">1835</date>.</note>In <date value="1835">1835</date> the great series of changes was completed
by the Municipal Corporations Reform Act, which did for
the local parliaments of the boroughs what the
Reform Bill had done for England's Parliament
at Westminster. It put an end to the old confused state of
things, and established in each corporate town a Mayor,
chosen every year, and a popularly elected Town-Council,
a third of which, however, the House of Lords required, was
to consist of Aldermen, elected by the councillors from themselves or the electors. The old corporations had mostly been
self-appointed, and were often scandalously corrupt. The
new ones, though sometimes falling under the management of
inferior men, did their work much better. Some small corporations were outside the Act. The vast vested interests
of the City of London saved it also from reform.</p>

the widower of the Princess Charlotte, who was limited by a
constitution like the new one in France. As the Dutch
would not give up Antwerp, the English fleet blockaded the
Scheldt, while the French besieged the Citadel.  This
settled the whole business. In Portugal, <persName key="Palmerston, Henry Temple, Viscount">Palmerston</persName> actively sympathised with the Constitutional party and the
young Queen Maria, now so hard pressed by Dom <persName key="Miguel, Dom">Miguel</persName>
that her father Dom Pedro came over from Brazil to help
her. English volunteers poured in to her aid. Her English
admiral, Napier, defeated her uncle's fleet, and in <date value="1833">1833</date>
she was everywhere triumphant. A similar struggle broke
out in Spain, where, in <date value="1833">1833</date>, King <persName key="Ferdinand VII.">Ferdinand</persName> died, leaving
the throne to his infant daughter Isabella, with her mother
Christina as regent. But their claims were contested by
her uncle Don Carlos. A fierce civil war broke out, Carlos
aiming at despotism, and professing legitimist principles,
while the Christinos were, in name at least, constitutionalists.
In <date value="1834">1834</date> <persName key="Palmerston, Henry Temple, Viscount">Palmerston</persName> formed a Quadruple Alliance between
the two peninsula queens and the English and French.
This put a final end to Dom <persName key="Miguel, Dom">Miguel</persName>, and for a time settled
the fate of Don Carlos, though he soon renewed the war,
and was not finally beaten till <date value="1840">1840</date>, the English legion of
volunteers under General De Lacy Evans sharing largely
in his defeat.</p>
  <p>Constitutionalism was thus established all over the West,
and, as <persName key="Palmerston, Henry Temple, Viscount">Palmerston</persName> boasted, the Quadruple Alliance served
as a powerful counterpoise to the East, where the principles
of the Holy Alliance still prevailed owing to the close friendship of Austria, Russia, and Prussia. The national and
liberal movements in Germany and Italy were suppressed.
The Czar Nicholas now crushed the Poland that the
Vienna Congress had in a way restored, abolished its
constitution, and annexed it to the Russian empire. It
was impossible for <persName key="Palmerston, Henry Temple, Viscount">Palmerston</persName> to prevent this.  The
Turks were now so hard pressed by Mehemet Ali and
Ibrahim Pasha, who had overrun Syria and threatened
Constantinople, that they had to call on Russian aid, in
return for which the Bosphorus was opened to Russian
ships by the Treaty of Unkiar Skelesi (<date value="1833">1833</date>), despite the
protests of England and France.</p>

during these years. Their opposition to reform had made
them so unpopular that they were in a miserable

never to sit in a reformed House of Commons.
But <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName> knew that the middle classes were no
revolutionists, and set about forming a new party adapted to
the new state of things. He was brilliantly successful in and
out of Parliament. The old Tories gradually came back to
their allegiance, and the weakness of the Whigs bit by bit
turned sensible men towards him, though his cold manners,
his shyness and awkwardness, and his want of stirring
principles or vivid enthusiasm, prevented him from being
personally popular.</p>
  <p><quote>" How enviable is <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName>'s position,"</quote> wrote Greville in <date value="1834">1834</date>;

 <quote>"played the part of a Richelieu for a brief time"</quote> by holding
 the Treasury and three Secretaryships. When <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName> got

 Tamworth Manifesto, and called together a new Parliament.
 The Conservatives gained enormously, but were still not
 quite a majority; and the unfriendliness of <persName key="Stanley, Edward, 14th Earl of Derby">Stanley</persName> and his

been brought up so quietly by her mother, the Duchess of
Kent (who lived apart from the Court, having
quarrelled with King William), that very few
people knew much about her. But her first
acts pleased everybody. Greville speaks of her

simple and natural. It is become his province to educate,
instruct, and form the most interesting mind and character
in the world."</quote></p>
  <p>In <date value="1838">1838</date> the Government, anxious to fulfil the hopes of its
supporters, and to do signal service to the sister country,
carried a Poor Law for Ireland, despite the violent resistance of Irish members of all parties. This brought into
Ireland the English system with a strict workhouse test, but
without the law of settlement. This Bill did as much as any
law could to stop pauperism in a poor country. The Irish
Tithe Bill-a long-desired reform-(<date value="1838">1838</date>) and Irish Corporation Bill (<date value="1840">1840</date>) also got through at last, though much
cut about by the Opposition. But there was much disaffection among the Canadian French, and a rising among the
negroes in Jamaica. The budget was high, and Whig
finance was still a byword.   Even the Penny Postage
system, carried in <date value="1839">1839</date> at the suggestion of Rowland Hill,
though a great blessing to the people, was a dead loss to
the revenue.</p>
  <p>2. <note place="foot" n="2">Chartism, <dateRange from="1838" to="1839">1838-39</dateRange>.</note>The state of the country grew   worse.  Workmen
suffered from long spells of forced idleness through bad
trade, or laboured hard in miserable workshops
for a wretched pittance. Floating discontent
found one expression in the schemes of the brilliant Welshman Robert Owen to reorganise society on the basis of
Socialism (see Chapter VI.), and came to a head in the
Chartist movement. In <date value="1838">1838</date> Feargus <persName key="O'Connor, Feargus">O'Connor</persName>, a boisterous Irishman, bold in speech but irresolute in action and
unstable in character, formerly one of <persName key="O'Connell, Daniel">O'Connell</persName>'s <quote>"Tail,"</quote>
became the leader of those who demanded the Five Points
of the People's Charter, which gave a unity of aim to the
hitherto divided and scattered reformers.</p>
	<p>The Points were- 1. Universal suffrage. 2. Vote by ballot. 3.
Annual Parliaments. 4. The abolition of the property qualification
for Members of Parliament. 5. Payment of Members. 6. Equal
electoral districts was originally a sixth Point, but this was left out in
the National Petition.</p>

  <p>At bottom the movement was social, not political; what
the poor Chartists felt was the dulness, hopelessness, and
misery of the workman's daily life. Their mistake was in

thinking that changes in the State alone would make it
brighter and better. No doubt it could do something, but
they too completely believed that political reforms could
bring about social amelioration.</p>
  <p><quote>"The principle of the People's Charter,"</quote> said the hot-headed
preacher Stephens, <quote>"is the right of every man to have his home, his
hearth, and his happiness. The question of universal suffrage is after
all a knife-and-fork question. It means that every workman has a
right to have a good hat and coat, a good roof, a good dinner, no
more work than will keep him in health, and as much wages as will
keep him in plenty."</quote></p>
  <p>In <date value="1839">1839</date> Attwood, the old Reformer, laid before Parliament
the National Petition of the Chartists, with more than a
million signatures. But the Commons took no heed of it,
and the <quote>"physical force"</quote> party (so the more desperate
Chartists were called) drilled their followers, held great
meetings, and got ready for revolt. Riots burst out at
Birmingham, at Devizes, and Llanidloes; and the excitable
Welsh colliers and ironworkers marched down from the
Monmouthshire hills to seize Newport. A regular fight
broke out in Newport streets; but the brave Mayor,
Phillips, scattered the Chartist bands, and their leaders,
Frost, Jones, and Williams, were tried and punished.
Want of leaders and organisation, and the great difference
in objects among the Chartists themselves, led to their
failure. For a while Chartism was stayed.</p>

<persName key="Palmerston, Henry Temple, Viscount">Palmerston</persName>'s foreign policy. His great aim now was to
destroy the Holy Alliance in the East, and he
wrongly believed that Turkey could be made to
live a new life as a civilised European power,
and be England's greatest support against Russia and her
allies. Along with France, he succeeded in breaking the
bondage of Turkey to Russia, which sprang from the
Treaty of Unkiar-Skelesi. But France was playing her
own game, and her restless and crafty Minister <persName key="Thiers, A.">Thiers</persName>
backed up Mehemet Ali, Pasha of Egypt (now in revolt

open to the charge of meddlesomeness abroad and arbitrary
self-will at home. England also succeeded in the Opium
War with China, which brought the English the little
island of Hong Kong, and opened five Chinese ports to our

legal rights for which <persName key="George III.">George III.</persName> had fought so manfully.
Like the Lords, the Crown now became a checking and
regulating, rather than a moving, force. It remained as
the pledge and symbol of the unity and continuity of the
national life, and could do good work in tempering the evils
of absolute party government. Such of the royal prerogatives as were not dead must be carried out by ministers.

 the conversion of the Prime Minister himself,

 were let in duty free. The famine in Ireland caused by the
 failure of the potato crop brought things to a head. On
 1st November <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName> summoned his Cabinet, told them that
 anyhow the corn tax must be relaxed to feed the starv ing Irish, and that once given up no minister could
 venture to bring it in again. The ministers were divided,
 and took time to think about it. Thereupon Lord John
 <persName key="Russell, John">Russell</persName> wrote his famous Edinburgh Letter, in which he

Fainting forms, hunger-stricken, what see ye in the offing?
Stately ships to bear our food away and the strangers scoffing.

They guard our master's granaries from the hunger of the poor."</quote></p>
  <p>England was deeply moved by the tale of Irish suffering,
and the Government bestirred itself to help the famine-
stricken land. But the ministers were ignorant and timid, and
afraid of the cry of the Radicals and Economists that State
interference with trade and the food-supply went against
the teachings of <persName key="Smith, Adam">Adam Smith</persName> and <persName key="Ricardo, David">Ricardo</persName>. So they started
relief-works, such as road-making, and paid the workers;
but they took care that the roads should lead nowhere, and
they left the food-supply to the ordinary traders, who made
disgraceful fortunes by speculating in Indian meal and flour.
The worn-out victims of famine were forced to waste their
scanty strength on useless work, and to drag their weary
frames for miles to the nearest shop of the food speculator.
The land lay untilled, because better wages could be got
from the Government works. All sorts of jobbery went on
among the Government officials, contractors, and tradesfolk.</p>
  <p>The misery still remained, and famine and fever still
raged.  In <date value="1847">1847</date> Government dropped its fears of the
Economists, and opened soup-kitchens and gave away
Indian-corn meal.  Ships of any country were allowed
to take in corn duty free. Large sums were advanced to
the bankrupt boards of guardians, who had been quite
powerless to meet the rush of the whole people to the work-
houses. Lavish private charity did something more.</p>
  <p><note place="foot" n="4">Results of the Famine.</note>All sorts of schemes were now brought forward for

rejected Lord George <persName key="Bentinck, George">Bentinck</persName>'s wise scheme

nothing but alter the poor-law in a way that made it the
direct interest of the landlords to get rid of the poor from
their estates. Many landlords, seeing the cottier system
did not pay, set to work to turn out the poor tenants, and
turn their little holdings into large farms. <quote>" I have seen,"</quote>

done to stop the evictions.</p>
  <p><note place="foot" n="6">The Encumbered Estates Act, <date value="1849">1849</date>.</note>The landlords were in many cases almost as badly off as
their tenants, and their estates were often so encumbered
and mortgaged, that they excused their harshness
under the plea of poverty.  To prevent
this, Government passed in <date value="1849">1849</date> the
Encumbered Estates Act, which allowed the broken-down landlord
to sell his property, and gave the buyer a parliamentary
title. This measure did but partial good, for the new
landlords, though richer and more energetic, were quite
out of touch with the people.  But it sealed the doom
of the cottier system, except in the barren highlands of
the west, where it still lingers on. Yet the bringing in of
English ways and English capital made the Irish more
bitter than ever, though the mass of the people slowly but
steadily got better off. A vast emigration completed the
depopulation which famine and fever had begun.  Fever
followed the miserable wanderers to the filthy and closely
packed emigrant ships. The survivors could not fail to
hand down to their children the fiercest hatred of the
English name.</p>

the thrones of Europe. Louis Philippe was driven from
France, and a republic set up.  In Italy the
Liberal movement for national unity was revived,
headed by a new and reforming Pope, Pius IX.,
and by Charles Albert, King of <placeName key="Sardinia">Sardinia</placeName>. Metternich, the
prop of the Holy Alliance, was turned out of office at Vienna,
but Hungary rose in revolt under the eloquent and energetic
Kossuth. In Germany the Liberals sought unity by getting
rid of the princelings, bringing together a Parliament at
Frankfort, and wresting sea-girt Schleswig-Holstein from
its Danish masters. In Switzerland the Catholic cantons
formed the Sonderbund, and went to war against the
radical Diet of the Confederation. Popular revolts broke
out everywhere.</p>

mediation was not very successful. Spain and England
broke off diplomatic relations because
<persName key="Palmerston, Henry Temple, Viscount">Palmerston</persName> backed up the Progressistas against
Narvaez, the Moderado minister. He failed to prevent war
between <placeName key="Sardinia">Sardinia</placeName> and Austria, and the defeat of the former
at Novara put back the unity of Italy (<date value="1849">1849</date>). But as time
went on the Liberal movement became a revolutionary one.
A mob rising bathed Paris in blood, and street-fighting
went on in half the great cities of Europe. The Pope was
turned out of Rome, and a republic set up under the high-
souled Mazzini and the fearless, warm-hearted Garibaldi.
The worst of the old rulers gave up their thrones to
younger and less hated kinsmen. In great alarm Frederick
William IV. of Prussia backed out of the national movement
in Germany. Russia helped Francis Joseph, the new
Austrian Emperor (his uncle Ferdinand I. had resigned),
to restore his despotic rule in Hungary. Reaction followed
revolution, and the national and Liberal cause seemed
undone. At last Austria got back its hold on Italy, and
Germany returned to the obedience of its many rulers.
Finally a needy and cunning adventurer, Louis Napoleon,
the son of Hortense Beauharnais, and Louis, sometime
King of Holland, <persName key="Napoleon">Napoleon</persName> I.'s brother, had got himself
elected President of the French Republic, upset the
Constitution he had sworn to observe, murdered or imprisoned
his chief opponents by the coup d'etat of 2d December <date value="1851">1851</date>,
and brought in a military despotism, under a ring of vulgar
fortune-hunters of the lowest type, headed by his half-

of the great Emperor's reign. <persName key="Palmerston, Henry Temple, Viscount">Palmerston</persName> was so disgusted
with revolutions ending in anarchy that, in his jaunty way,
he privately expressed the fullest approval of what had
been done. But it is hard to draw a line between a

pledged the Queen, the Cabinet, and the nation to approving

 A conference at Vienna in July resulted in the Vienna

But Louis Napoleon saw in the quarrel a chance of

between England and France, who now took up a more
energetic line than Austria and Prussia. The English and
French fleets steamed eastwards, and, on Russia finally
rejecting the Vienna Note, entered the Dardanelles (October

  end. After a wonderful display of valour, they were forced back,
  cruelly cut up. Such deeds filled the English with confidence and the
  Russians with fear; but it is not thus that campaigns are won. Yet it
  was almost the same story over again when, in the darkness and mist
  of the early morning of 5th November, the Russians in Sebastopol

out. Prussia was now ruled by the soldierly William I.,
brother of the weak Frederick William IV., and by his

 with the Reform Bill of <date value="1832">1832</date>. It was a time of middle-class
 ascendency, and the strong and weak points of the English
 middle class are brought out clearly in the history of the
 period. It begins with a great and far-reaching movement
 for reform which alarmed many. But the old governing

classes went on ruling much as they had done before, and <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName>
soon proved that the new masters were no revolutionaries.</p>
	<p><note place="foot" n="38">The period of Middle-Class Ascendency, <dateRange from="1832" to="1866">1832-66</dateRange>.</note>Within ten years of the Reform Bill a
Conservative party, with new cries, harmonising with
the new electors' feelings, formed the strongest
and most solid Government of the period.
But the interests of the country districts and the towns soon
came into violent conflict, with the counter-cries of <quote>" Help
the farmer and landlord to keep up English agriculture,"</quote>
and <quote>" Give cheap bread to the workman and factory hand."</quote>
Middle-class Conservatism now split up between
Protectionists and Peelites, and power came back to the Liberals,
through little merit of their own.  Henceforward the
Liberals kept in power, for the gallant efforts of <persName key="Disraeli, Benjamin">Disraeli</persName> to
build up a new Conservatism did not appeal to the plodding
minds and limited sympathies of the average tradesman and
manufacturer. But the old desire to let things alone now
overcame the aged leaders of the victorious Liberals.  At
last <persName key="Palmerston, Henry Temple, Viscount">Palmerston</persName> was found to bring all parties together.
The <quote>"Tory chief of a Radical Cabinet"</quote> (this was <persName key="Disraeli, Benjamin">Disraeli</persName>'s
apt description of him) kept his followers in check, and won
the support of his opponents, who saw in him the strongest
Conservative force of the time.  In despair, the fiercer
Liberals, chafing under his yoke, planned far-reaching
changes and thoroughgoing reforms. In equal despair of
the ruling classes, the Conservative leader appealed from the
middle to the working classes, whom he hoped to find more
ready pupils for his new Toryism. Now begins the
transition to democracy, which all parties helped on, though none
with full knowledge of what they were doing. The twenty
years that follow are occupied with the working out of
this movement.  It is a time full of changes and stirring
events: new problems are more earnestly discussed, and
strong efforts made to probe to the bottom the source of
national evils. We have now to see what was the direction
of this new development, but as we get nearer our own time
we can only hope to understand the general bearing and
outside history of events.  Not till this generation has
passed away can their inner meaning be clear.</p>

         <p>The following were the chief provisions of the Reform
      Acts of <date value="1867">1867</date> and <date value="1868">1868</date> :-</p>
        <quote rend="blockquote"><note place="foot" n="4">The Second Reform Acts <dateRange from="1867" to="1868">1867-68</dateRange>.</note>(1) All male householders got votes in English and Scotch boroughs,
      if rated to pay poor's rate ; but in Ireland a  &#x00A3; 4 rating limit was fixed.
      Lodgers who paid &#x00A3;10 a year for unfurnished rooms could also vote.
      (2) Occupiers of &#x00A3;12 a year (&#x00A3;14 in Scotland) got votes
      in the counties. (3) 11 boroughs were disfranchised, 4
      for bribery, and 35 having less than 10,000 inhabitants
      lost one member. (4) The vacant seats were given mostly
      to the greater counties, especially <placeName key="Lancashire">Lancashire</placeName> and the West Riding;
      but ten new boroughs got one member apiece; two new London
      boroughs (<placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> and Hackney) got two each; Leeds, <placeName key="Liverpool">Liverpool</placeName>,
      <placeName key="Manchester">Manchester</placeName>, Birmingham, and Glasgow got a third member; and
      Salford, Dundee, and Merthyr a second; while 10 new boroughs
      returned one apiece, as also did London University and the Scotch
      Universities (grouped in pairs). (5) To give some representation to
      minorities, an elector could only vote for two wherever there were
      three members to be returned. Household Suffrage was thus brought
      in in the boroughs, and a great step was made towards democracy, for
      it was plain that the middle-class county constituencies could not last
      very much longer, now that all workmen who happened to live in
      boroughs had their votes.</quote>

       a treaty which broke up the German Confederation
       of <date value="1815">1815</date>, turned out Austria from all dealings with German affairs, and built up a North German
       Confederation, with Prussia at its head.   It was a great
       triumph for King William and Bismarck, and nearly brought
       about German unity; for Prussia ruled the new Confederation, and had absorbed, with other States, Schleswig-Holstein

  George.  Italy also took advantage of Austria's distress,
  and went to war with her old master, though she was
  beaten by land and sea. Yet Prussia's success procured
  the evacuation of Venetia by the Austrians, and its
  transference to <persName key="Emanuel, Victor">Victor Emanuel</persName>'s kingdom. All through both
  struggles England kept a strict neutrality. But in <date value="1867">1867</date>
  Lord <persName key="Stanley, Edward, 14th Earl of Derby">Stanley</persName> (son of the Premier), the Foreign Secretary,

  barbarian who had imprisoned some English subjects. Sir
  R. Napier (afterwards Lord Napier of Magdala)
  led 12,000 troops, mostly Indian, to Theodore's
  inland stronghold of Magdala, and compelled the release of
  the captives. Theodore slew himself in a fit of despair.
  A rough settlement was made with his successor, and the
  English troops retired as quickly as possible.  A new

  <p>4. <note place="foot" n="7">The Fenians, <dateRange from="1863" to="1867">1863-67</dateRange>.</note>Ireland was again the chief trouble. Since the time
of the Young Ireland agitation and the Famine, Ireland
had been getting a little more prosperous,
through the bettering of agriculture and trade.
But it had never been contented, though the break-up of
the Pope's Brass Band under Sadleir and Keogh had for
some years prevented the formation of an Irish party in
Parliament. A thoroughgoing revolutionary movement was
started about <date value="1863">1863</date> by a party of Irish and Irish Americans
who hated English rule, and aimed at setting up an Irish
republic. A secret society, the Irish Republican Brotherhood,
known as the Fenians, was set on foot, headed in
Ireland by John O'Leary and James Stephens, one of the
Head Centres, and advocated by Jeremiah Donovan, calling
himself O'Donovan Rossa, whose newspaper, the Irish
People, was one mouthpiece of the new agitation. Though
the priests held aloof, frightened by the anti-clerical views
of many of the American Irish, the peasants were warmly
sympathetic. But in <date value="1865">1865</date> their plans were betrayed to the
<persName key="Russell, John">Russell</persName> Government, and several of the leaders were arrested.
Stephens escaped from prison, but O'Donovan Rossa was
sentenced to imprisonment for life. One of the last acts
of <persName key="Russell, John">Russell</persName>'s was to pass an Act suspending the Habeas
Corpus Act in Ireland. The Irish-American leaders then

fled over the Atlantic, where they planned an invasion of
Canada.   In May <date value="1866">1866</date> a disorganised band of twelve
hundred Fenians crossed the Niagara river, but they were
checked by the local militia, and their schemes discouraged
and disavowed by the United States Government.    In
February <date value="1867">1867</date> Michael Davitt and others attacked Chester
Castle with a view to getting arms. In September Allen,
Larkin, and Gould rescued Kelly and Deasy from a police
van at <placeName key="Manchester">Manchester</placeName>, and shot the police sergeant in charge,
for which crime they were hung. In December the wall
of Clerkenwell prison, where several Fenian leaders were
confined, was blown down with gunpowder, through which
many innocent persons were fearfully injured, several slain,
and all London frightened.  These acts forced attention to the state of Ireland, where also the Fenians had
sought to raise up revolts that proved wretched failures.

the aristocratic Whigs, and for the next six years their
pent-up energies found an outlet in carrying out a series of
changes, greater than ever previously attempted.</p>
  <p>6. <note place="foot" n="10">Disestablishment of the Irish Church, <date value="1869">1869</date>.</note>The elections sealed the fate of the Protestant
Establishment in Ireland. All Catholic Irishmen looked upon the
Established Church as the badge of foreign
conquest, and nearly half the Irish Protestants
were Nonconformist Presbyterians. The Church
had been, to some extent, reformed by the Grey
ministry, and was now doing its spiritual work far better
than in the eighteenth century.   But it was by its very
character a memorial of foreign political ascendency; and
after the failure of the <quote>" Appropriation Clause "</quote> had disposed
of the last hope of a scheme for concurrent endowment, its
fate was doomed.    Yet the Government Bill was almost
wrecked when the Lords put in amendments which the
Commons would not accept; but the good sense of Lord
Cairns, himself an Irish Churchman, suggested a compromise,
and the measure passed.</p>
  <quote rend="blockquote">By the Irish Church Act (1) The Church of Ireland was
disestablished, the Church Courts abolished, and the Irish bishops lost their
seats in the Lords; (2) The grants to the Catholic seminary at
Maynooth and the Regium Donum to the Presbyterians were commuted ;
(3) A new corporation, the <quote>"Church of Ireland,"</quote> was created, to which
was transferred the churches, cathedrals, parsonages, and all private
endowment since <date value="1660">1660</date>. Altogether over  &#x00A3; 10,000,000 was secured to
the Church; (4) Full compensation was given to the clergy for their
life interests; (5) The surplus was set aside to relieve unavoidable
distress outside the scope of the Poor Law.</quote>
  <p>7. <note place="foot" n="11">The Irish Land System.</note>After settling the Church, the new ministry made a
bold attempt to grapple with the Irish land question. The
weak points of the Irish land system had been
revealed by the Devon Commission, but nothing
had been done to redress them, and a long series of
abortive Bills showed the indifference or thoughtlessness of the
successive governments. Speaking roughly, the land law in
England and Ireland was the same, but the practical
differences were enormous, owing to the very different condition of the two countries.  In both countries rents were
supposed to be settled by full and free competition. In
England this was to some degree real, but in Ireland the
needy and improvident peasant farmers, to whom getting a
farm was their only help against starvation, were quite unable
to bargain on equal terms with their landlords. Moreover,
while in England most improvements were made, and all
buildings set up by the landlord, in Ireland all improvements were made and buildings set up by the tenant,


<pb id="p.210" n="210"/>

<note place="top" n="1">[<dateRange from="1870" to="1871">1870-1871</dateRange>.]</note>



though, as soon as they were made, they became the legal
property of the landlord. In the old times custom, which
had almost the force of law, kept the tenant on his holding
for generations together.  But now grasping agents and
improving landlords, with English ideas, sought simply to
make all they could out of their lands, and rack-rented and
evicted just as they thought fit. In the north the Ulster
Custom allowed the outgoing tenant to sell his goodwill and
improvements to the incoming farmer. But this, and similar customs elsewhere, had no formal legal sanction. Thus
it was that the very improvements in Irish agriculture since
the famine had only added to the great sum of Irish agrarian
discontent, and deepened the wide and impassable differences of race, religious feelings, and often language, between
landlord and tenant.</p>
	<quote rend="blockquote"><note place="foot" n="12">The first Irish Land Act, <date value="1870">1870</date>.</note>The session of <date value="1870">1870</date> was mostly taken up with the Irish Land Act,
which sought to remedy these evils. By it (1) The Ulster Tenant
Right, and other simi1ar customs, were recognised as legal; (2)
Tenants evicted by landlords, except for non-payment
of rent, were allowed compensation for disturbance ; (3)
Compensation was given for improvements; (4) The
Government offered to lend money to tenants who wished to buy their
holdings.</quote>
  <p>The effect of the Act was to establish or recognise a dual
ownership of the land between landlord and tenant, as
<persName key="Disraeli, Benjamin">Disraeli</persName> pointed out. But it was not thorough enough, and
therefore not a great success. It was in some ways a compromise between what were regarded as the teachings of
Political Economy and the fruits of Irish experience. It was
therefore based neither on the recognition of free competition nor on the State regulation of the whole business. It
left landlords as free to evict as ever, if they chose to pay
the compensation. By granting long leases they could, and
did, evade the Act. The purchase-clauses did little good,
as landlords were seldom willing to sell. Moreover, the
grievances of centuries are not forgotten in a day; and the
yielding to outrage reforms that had been denied to argument and reason might naturally be looked on as an incentive to violence and crime. A stringent Peace Preservation
Act passed side by side with the Land Act, and preserved
order for a time.</p>
  <p>8, National education was at last set on foot through the
clever compromises, and rough, shrewd common-sense, of

violent opposition of the Dissenters, the teachers

Regulation Act, which brought in short service, and established the germs of a new army system, to
include militia and volunteers, as well as the
regulars, and proposed to abolish the old system
of officers buying their promotion, with compensation to
those affected. But the old army interest in the House did
its best to stop by obstruction the passing of the Act, and
the Lords tried to shelve it.  So the Government took the
high-handed but necessary course of abolishing purchase
by a Royal Warrant. In <date value="1872">1872</date> the preliminary reorganisation of the army was completed, but still greater reforms
were probably required.</p>

three new armies beyond the Loire, and for a time put the Germans
in a perilous plight.  But the Metz army surrendered through the
weakness and wickedness of its general, Bazaine. The well-led German
hosts kept the enthusiastic but raw and ill-commanded French levies
at bay, and in March <date value="1871">1871</date>, after the surrender of Paris, the Peace of

the southern States joined with the north in a new German empire,
under King William of Prussia, who accepted the Imperial crown at
Versailles. Italian unity was also secured at the same time; for on
the fall of Napoleon, who had upheld the temporal power of the Pope,
the Italians entered the Papal States, and Rome became the capital of
<persName key="Emanuel, Victor">Victor Emanuel</persName>'s kingdom.  This drew united Italy very close to
united Germany. The Austrian House giving up for the time her
old anti-German and anti-Italian policy, soon joined the league, with
which Russia was also for a time connected, but the re-opening of the
Eastern Question brought out a sharp antagonism between Russia and
Austria which, in the long run, brought Russia nearer France. But

roughness and want of tact of some of the lesser ministers.
Bye-elections showed that the ministry had altogether lost

which proposed to set up a secular University of Ireland, in
which no theology, history, or philosophy were to be taught,

and passed useful measures, which, not having much party
bearing, hardly brought them so much credit as
they deserved.  The first session was almost
taken up with ecclesiastical legislation. It was proposed to
amend the Endowed Schools Act in the interests of the
Church, but the storm of opposition led the Government to
content itself with handing over the powers of the thorough-
going Endowed Schools Commission to the less advanced
Charity Commission. The Scotch Church Patronage Act
at last gave congregations the power of choosing their own
ministers, though it was now too late to do much good. The
Public Worship Regulation Act, passed, as <persName key="Disraeli, Benjamin">Disraeli</persName> said,
<quote>"to put down Ritualism,"</quote> failed in its object, but established
a new court which has proved offensive to a large body of
the clergy. The Government completed their predecessors'
Judicature Acts.  Their own measures were numerous.
The Agricultural Holdings Act sought to give tenants
compensation for improvements. Lord Cairns's Land Transfer
Bill aimed at registering titles to land. Cross's Labourers'
Dwellings Act allowed the corporations of large towns
compulsory powers to buy land and build houses for the poor.
<persName key="Northcote, Stafford, Lord Iddesleigh">Northcote</persName>'s Friendly Societies Bill gave benefit societies an
opportunity of having their solvency certified by the Government.
But all these Bills, wise and well-meaning in their
scope, were permissive and not compulsory. So, though they
sometimes prepared public opinion for stronger measures in
the same direction, they were not wholly satisfactory, as the
worst offenders found it easy to ignore them altogether. But
by defining more liberally what constituted criminal breach
of contract and conspiracy, and by consolidating the Factory

well-drilled followers responding with but little murmuring
to the most sudden commands of their leaders.
The leadership of the Opposition was now resigned
by <persName key="Gladstone, William E.">Gladstone</persName> to Lord Hartington. In <date value="1876">1876</date> <persName key="Disraeli, Benjamin">Disraeli</persName>
became Earl of Beaconsfield, and left the Commons, under
the mild and gentle guidance of Sir Stafford <persName key="Northcote, Stafford, Lord Iddesleigh">Northcote</persName>, to
face a new Irish difficulty. In <date value="1870">1870</date> a Home Rule League
had been formed to agitate for a local parliament to manage
Irish business. A body of Home Rulers were soon sent to
Parliament, led by Isaac <persName key="Butt, Isaac">Butt</persName>, a <quote>" weak, kindly, unassuming,
childlike,"</quote> and eloquent Protestant lawyer, and soon mustered about 60 <quote>"patriots and placehunters."</quote>  But the more
determined and thoroughgoing Home Rulers grew tired
of <persName key="Butt, Isaac">Butt</persName>'s mild methods.  They sought to further their
cause, under Biggar's guidance, by taking advantage of the
forms of the House of Commons to force the Government to
listen to them under pressure of systematic obstruction, and
found a sort of justification by more attention being paid
to their demands. A small knot of members, regardless of
the orderly and gentlemanly traditions of the House, was
able to keep Parliament sitting all night, and almost prevent
any business from being done. The leadership of his disorderly and disobedient followers gradually dropped from
<persName key="Butt, Isaac">Butt</persName>'s nerveless hands. Virtually deposed in <date value="1877">1877</date>, he died
in <date value="1879">1879</date>. A new Nationalist Party was now formed under
the stronger, cooler, and more astute guidance of Charles
Stewart <persName key="Parnell, Charles Stewart">Parnell</persName>, a Protestant country gentleman from
Wicklow   Its objects were even more agrarian than
political. The Land Act had not fully dealt with the evils
it had sought to remedy. But the new party went further
than seeking to amend it. They started, in October <date value="1879">1879</date>,
a Land League to <quote>"bring about a reduction of rack rents,
and to obtain the ownership of the soil for the occupier."</quote>
<persName key="Parnell, Charles Stewart">Parnell</persName> visited America to win the help and money of the
American-Irish for the crusade against <quote>"landlordism."</quote>
Outrages became common, intensified by violent speeches
to ignorant and excitable audiences, suffering terribly from
the severe distress that now broke out in Ireland.  The
Government took steps to relieve the famine, and arrested
some of the more violent Irish leaders.  But no further
proposal was made of agrarian legislation.</p>

Italy was felt in the Balkan Peninsula; but the difficulty was

that it contained not one nation but many. <note place="foot" n="24">Nationality in the Balkan Peninsula.</note>The Slavs were
broken into petty fractions under different rulers, though
they all turned to Russia as the natural head
of a Pan-Slavonic movement, which would
have been as fatal to the House of Austria
as to the Sultan.  There were also the claims of the
Greeks, Albanians, Bulgarians (a Mongol race akin to the
Turks and Hungarians), and Roumanians (a Latin people
speaking a Romance tongue like French or Italian) to be
considered. But they were all at one against the hateful
misrule of their barbarous Mohammedan oppressors.
Bosnia and Bulgaria were the chief scenes of Turkish
outrage, and both called to Russia for help and support.
The English however would not permit Russia's advancing
to Constantinople, especially since her recent conquests
in Turkestan had brought her almost to the frontiers of
Afghanistan, and not very far from the British Indian
border. Still, all attempts to reform Turkey had clearly
failed, and even Beaconsfield felt that it was useless to
prop up so miserable a power. The best way now, as in
the days of <persName key="Canning, George">Canning</persName>, would probably have been for Europe
to combine to force the Turks to give a large section of
their worse ruled subjects some kind of self-government.
But Turkey opposed a stolid resistance to the Andrassy
Note, which sought to force a few needful reforms on her,
and deemed the unwise refusal of England to accept the
more stringent Berlin Note to show our intention to back
them up in any case. Servia and Montenegro at last took
up arms against the Porte, and zealous Russian volunteers
flocked to their standards. The Turks had gained some
easy victories over the ill-led Servian levies, and, flushed
with success, rejected the demands of the European Conference at Constantinople (January <date value="1877">1877</date>). <note place="foot" n="25">The Russo-Turkish War, <dateRange from="1877" to="1878">1877-78</dateRange>.</note>This was the
last effort of diplomacy.  The failure of the European
Concert, and the crying wrongs of the Christians of the Balkan lands, and refusal of all
redress, drove Russia to declare war. A fierce
struggle raged for a year between enemies equally matched
in stubborn valour and faith in their cause, though unequal in warlike skill and science.  Despite the gallant
resistance of the Turks behind the hastily-constructed
but well-munitioned earthworks of Plevna, the skill of

the Russians marching in triumph on the undefended
capital, Constantinople.  Since <date value="1876">1876</date> there had grown up a
strong feeling in England against helping the Turks, when
it was found out with what barbarity they had treated the
protesting Bulgarians. But the plain danger of a Russian
occupation of Constantinople now brought about a strong
cry for war. Beaconsfield fostered the agitation, and sent
the fleet to the Sea of Marmora, called out the reserves in
England, and hurried Sepoys from India to Malta. Lord
Derby, the Foreign Secretary, and Lord <persName key="Carnarvon, Earl of">Carnarvon</persName>, the
Colonial Secretary, resigned in disgust; but the new Foreign
Minister, Lord <persName key="Salisbury, Robert Cecil. 3d Marquis of">Salisbury</persName>, took up a more decided attitude.</p>
  <p>Russia gave moderate terms to the Turks at San Stefano
(3d March <date value="1878">1878</date>), but Lord <persName key="Salisbury, Robert Cecil. 3d Marquis of">Salisbury</persName> declared that they
must be modified, and particularly objected to the proposed Bulgarian state, extending from the Danube to the
AEgean, as dangerous to British interests.  A Congress
of the Great Powers met, in June <date value="1878">1878</date>, at Berlin, in
which Beaconsfield and <persName key="Salisbury, Robert Cecil. 3d Marquis of">Salisbury</persName> represented the United
Kingdom. But before the meeting, Russia and England
came to an agreement, which the Congress had only to ratify.</p>
  <quote rend="blockquote"><note place="foot" n="26">The Berlin Treaty, <date value="1878">1878</date>.</note>By the Treaty of Berlin (1) The Bulgaria of the Treaty of San
Stefano was broken up; (2) Bulgaria north of the Balkans was made

Sultan,"</quote> but was allowed <quote>"administrative autonomy"</quote> under a Christian Pasha; (4) Montenegro, Servia, and Roumania were declared

Kars and Batoum in Asia; (6) A few obvious reforms were promised
in Crete and Armenia; (7) Fresh lands were to be ceded by separate
treaty to Greece; (8) An agreement with Turkey to protect Asia
Minor had already secured for the English the practical rule of Cyprus;
the Austrian House took possession of Bosnia.</quote>
  <p>Beaconsfield came back from Berlin boasting that he
had brought <quote>"peace with honour,"</quote> having brilliantly succeeded in what he loudly proclaimed was his sole object,
the maintenance of British interests in the East. He had
been accused of a private design of backing up Turkey;
but if he ever held this policy, he seems to have given
it up as impracticable. The dying Turkish Empire was
to be replaced by national self-governing states. That they
should at first look for guidance to Russia, their creator and
saviour, was the natural result of the apathy of the Powers
that had thrown the work of regeneration on the State most

stronger, Russia would naturally become their greatest

 ruled since <date value="1863">1863</date> by Ismail, son of Ibrahim, and grandson of
 Mehemet Ali. The new Khedive (Viceroy) was
 a vain, showy man, full of great schemes, and
 anxious to bring in Western money, enterprise,
 and civilisation. He actively encouraged the daring and
 adventurous Frenchman, Ferdinand de Lesseps, in
 digging the Suez Canal, though engineers said it was
 impossible, and <persName key="Palmerston, Henry Temple, Viscount">Palmerston</persName>, out of ill-judged jealousy, did his
 best to stop the works. Yet in <date value="1869">1869</date> the canal was opened,
 and England profited very largely by the faith and enterprise
 of the French shareholders. But Ismail's wasteful
 personal extravagance, and his outlay on his army and
 fleet, his great expenses in conquering the Soudan, or Black
 Country, around the Upper Nile, and in bringing in
 railways, telegraphs, harbours, and other Western works,
 had imposed a crushing burden on the wretched fellaheen
 (Egyptian peasantry), and Egypt was rapidly becoming
 bankrupt.  In <date value="1875">1875</date> the Cabinet bought Ismail's shares
 (nearly one-half of the whole capital) in the Suez Canal for
 England, and so got a control over the new waterway to
 <placeName key="India">India</placeName>. But this money only staved off the Khedive's
 distress for a short time. England and France were so much
 interested in Egypt that they were gradually led to
 interfere, though France soon grew jealous of England's
 increasing ascendency. At last Ismail made a great effort to shake
 off foreign control. He failed, and was deposed in <date value="1879">1879</date>.
 His son Tewfik, a nominal ruler, now became Khedive, and
 England and France set up a Dual Control which put the
 government of the country really into their hands.</p>

Prevention of Crimes Bill was hurriedly passed, and, to prevent
more obstruction, new parliamentary rules were drawn up
in an autumn session which allowed the forced closing of

Irish were now fiercely hostile to the Government, and
sought any occasion to turn them out of office.</p>

  <p>23. <note place="foot" n="34">Egyptian troubles, <dateRange from="1882" to="1884">1882-84</dateRange>.</note>Foreign complications soon began to overwhelm the
Government. The long troubles begun by Lord Lytton's
interference with Afghanistan were only ended by the with-
drawal of the English.  A series of disasters in South
Africa led to the restoration of the independence
of the Transvaal Republic. But the greatest
difficulty was in Egypt, where Arabi Pasha had
started a national Egyptian party, which sought to put an end
to European supremacy, and where a great religious rising in
the Soudan under a prophet who proclaimed himself the
Mahdi, threatened the destruction of the Egyptian power
on the Upper Nile. The Dual Control broke down when
the crisis came, and France left England to cope single-
handed against Arabi.  In July <date value="1882">1882</date> Alexandria was
bombarded, and in September Sir Garnet <persName key="Wolseley, Garnet">Wolseley</persName>
completely defeated Arabi at Tel-el-Kebir. This led to the
nominal restoration of the Khedive's power in Egypt; but
henceforth Egypt was practically ruled by England. But
in November <date value="1883">1883</date> the Mahdi completely crushed the
Egyptian army under its Pasha Hicks, an English officer,
who perished in the defeat. The Mahdi now ruled the
whole Soudan, save a few strong posts where loyal Egyptian
garrisons still held out against him. The chief of these was
at Khartoum, the capital, situated at the junction of the
White and the Blue Nile. England had no wish to keep up
the Egyptian power in the Soudan, but it was ungenerous to
leave the garrisons to their fate, and the Mahdi, if not
checked, might easily spread his influence among the fierce
Mohammedans of Egypt itself.  In January <date value="1884">1884</date> the
Government sent General Gordon to Khartoum to arrange
for withdrawing the garrisons from the Soudan.</p>
  <p>24. <note place="foot" n="35">Chinese Gordon.</note>Charles George Gordon was an engineer officer, who,
having served with distinction in the Crimea and in the
China War, had won great fame by putting
down for the Chinese government the formidable
revolt of the Taipings (<date value="1864">1864</date>), showing in his hard
and difficult task a wonderful courage and simple faith,
shrewd insight into savage character, and an extraordinary
power of governing men and inspiring them with trust
and enthusiasm for him. Henceforth known as Chinese
Gordon, he ultimately became ruler of the Egyptian
Soudan (<date value="1874">1874</date>-<date value="1879">1879</date>), where he led a great crusade against
the slave-trade, and again attracted all his subjects by
the simplicity, honesty, and energy which shone through
his fair complexion, honest blue eyes, and simple dress and

manner.  He now went off on his dangerous mission,
unarmed and almost unattended, and was welcomed in
Khartoum with almost the old enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>No man, however great, could save the garrisons as things
then were. Gordon soon saw either that the Mahdi must
be <quote>"smashed"</quote> by British troops, or that some strong
government must be left behind to save the Soudan from
anarchy. He therefore asked either for troops or for the
appointment, as his helper in ruling the Soudan, of the
<quote>" Black Pasha,"</quote> Zubehr, an old enemy of his in the days of
his government, who, though cruel and violent, and the
great upholder of the slave-dealers, was the only strong
man who could keep some sort of order in the disturbed
and barbarous province. The Government refused both of
his requests, largely out of fear of popular opinion. Gordon
was thoroughly disgusted. <quote>" I am now free,"</quote> he cried, <quote>" to
act according to circumstances. I shall hold out if I can,
and if not, retire to the Equator, leaving to you the
disgrace of abandoning the garrisons, and the certainty that
you will be forced to smash up the Mahdi."</quote> The Mahdi's
hosts soon drew near the doomed city, and a great cry
arose in England to save the hero that defended it. After
much hesitation the irresolute Government resolved to send
an army to his release. In August <date value="1884">1884</date> <persName key="Wolseley, Garnet">Wolseley</persName>, now a
lord, was again despatched to Egypt; and a force moved
up the Nile to the relief of Gordon. With rare energy and
amidst great hardships the English army pressed painfully
up against the stream, but the water was exceptionally low,
and progress was terribly slow. At last a flying column
under General Stewart travelled through the scorching
desert between Korti and Metemneh to avoid the
great bend of the Nile, and found at Gubat some of
Gordon's steamers sent down to meet them. <note place="foot" n="36">Death of Gordon,<date value="1885">1885</date>.</note>On 28th
January Sir C. Wilson (Stewart was slain in
battle) steamed up to Khartoum; but he was
too late. On 26th January Khartoum had been betrayed,
and Gordon was slain by a fanatic against the Mahdi's
commands.</p>
  <p>Unwonted energy was now shown, and a plan was formed
of sending a new army overland from Suakim, a port on
the Red Sea, to Berber on the Nile. But the Government
changed its mind again, and, throwing over the remaining
garrisons, confined itself to defending Suakim and the
Egyptian frontier. While this was going on Russia pressed
on her forces in Afghanistan, and, after a fight with the

inevitable. But the question was referred to
arbitration, and some sort of agreement patched up.
Meanwhile the Mahdi's influence declined in the strange way
so common in the East. Egypt had now comparative rest.</p>
  <p>25. <note place="foot" n="38">The Third Reform Act, <date value="1884">1884</date>.</note>The Government lost much ground in the country,
and some in the Commons over the Soudan business. But
a new Franchise Bill called away public
attention, especially after it was rejected by the
Lords, on the ground that no scheme for the Redistribution of
seats accompanied it. But in an autumn session the Bill was
brought forward again, a plan for redistributing seats being
arranged by agreement between the Liberals and Conservatives.
In December <date value="1884">1884</date> the Third Reform Act became law.</p>
  <quote rend="blockquote">(1) It made the franchise in counties the same as in the boroughs,
besides bringing in some new ways of getting a vote. (2) It
disfranchised all boroughs with under 15,000 inhabitants, and reduced all
under 50,000 to one member. (3) It cut up the country into single
member districts, each having about 50,000 inhabitants; the only
exceptions being old boroughs returning two representatives, between
50,000 and 165,000 inhabitants, and the City of London cut down
to two members. The result was that London got 62 instead of
22 members; <placeName key="Liverpool">Liverpool</placeName> 9, <placeName key="Manchester">Manchester</placeName> and Salford 9, Glasgow and
Birmingham 7 each, and so on in proportion. The great towns, and
still more the scattered country, mining and manufacturing districts,
thus got representation in proportion to their numbers. Ireland and
Wales kept their old number of members, though not entitled to so
many. Thus England was made a thoroughgoing democracy, dependent
on household suffrage, with almost equal electoral districts.</quote>

 For over twenty years the new Liberalism set
 forth its plans of large reforms, and for twenty
 years the new Conservatism maintained its spirited foreign
 policy and care for Imperial interests. These forces were
 now exhausted, or at least turned into other channels. The
 transition of democracy is now completed, and a new period,
 when feeling will rule more than reason, seems to have set
 in. The old party names and watchwords have ceased to
 have much meaning. New party lines form, new questions
 rise up, with the solution of which we are now busy. Just
 as the new era came in the Queen completed the fiftieth
 year of her long and beneficent reign. The loyal rejoicings

   <p>1. <note place="foot" n="1">The State and the Executive.</note>When the century began the central government of
 the country rested with ministers who in a very real sense
 remained Ministers of the Crown.    They
 have since become for most practical purposes
 the ministers of the people. <persName key="George III.">George III.</persName>'s great power was
 based upon his influence over an unreformed Parliament,
 and his success in appealing from Parliament to public
 opinion. But the French Revolution frightened both king
 and landowning governing class into a close alliance to
 uphold the power that each possessed. Then a great tide
 of outside opinion rose up against both, by reason of their
 selfish rule, and the lack of good law or executive. It
 did not cease to flow until England became a democracy.
 The Reform Bill of <date value="1832">1832</date> destroyed, though not all at once,
 the power of the Crown and the old aristocratic character
 of Parliament. When the Crown ceased again to govern,
 things fell back into their condition under the first two
 Georges. The House of Commons became again the
 one strong source of power. But it no longer rested on
 the noblemen, the squires, and a few select popular
 boroughs.  From  <date value="1832">1832</date> to <date value="1867">1867</date> it mirrored the feelings
 of the well-to-do middle-classes. After <date value="1867">1867</date> the better-
 paid workmen of the towns also came in. Since <date value="1885">1885</date> the
 householders in shires and boroughs alike became the
 arbiters of the national fate. The old landmarks moved
 slowly, but the Crown and House of Lords have gradually
 found it wise not to exercise many of their most important
 legal rights. They no longer strove to withstand strong
 currents of public opinion, but became content to act as
 moderating, regulating, and controlling forces. Thus the
 executive government has become altogether dependent on
 the House of Commons. Shrewd observers, like Prince
 <persName key="Albert, Prince Consort">Albert</persName>, feared lest parliamentary government might prove
 weak government. How could a State ruled by men of
 little special knowledge of their departments, and depending
altogether on the whims of a popular chamber, hope to
carry out a firm and consistent policy?</p>


<pb id="p.226" n="226"/>



  <p>2. <note place="foot" n="2">Growth of State interference. </note>The possible weakness of the executive became the
more dangerous as a strong tendency set in with the
present reign towards extending on every side
the work of the State. It was in vain that the
old school of Radicals and Political Economists
maintained that every body should be left as free as
possible, and that the State should make its sole business
the protection of life and property. Public opinion felt
they were wrong, and bitter experience showed that leaving
each individual to follow his selfish instincts brought about
great evils. So the State more and more busied itself with
things that in our grandfathers' time it cared little for. It
now sought to check the bad results of fierce competition;
to see that the workmen laboured in clean, healthy, and
properly-fenced workshops; to save helpless women and
children from unsuitable or excessive toil; to procure for
every child a proper education, and for every household a
fitting dwelling. It strove to control the giant monopolies
which the modern trading system had brought into being;
to save the poor and weak from forces too strong for them
to withstand, and to sweeten men's lot by providing means
for recreation, study, and refreshment of mind and body.
Bit by bit it began to concern itself with nearly every side of
the well-being of the community. The extension of the
State's functions has not yet stopped.</p>
  <p>3. <note place="foot" n="3">The machinery of the Central Government.</note>The growth of the functions of the executive supplied
a corrective to the dependence of the Government on the
whims of a popular chamber. A great mass of
new work, most of it consisting of dull and
seemingly unimportant details, and much of it
of a very technical and special character, now fell to the
Government's share. This brought about a more elaborate
organisation of the executive power. New ministers had
to be appointed, but as English ministers have no special
training or knowledge, and are chosen for their popular
and oratorical qualities rather than for their power as
administrators, they were forced into contenting themselves
with the general oversight of their department, while the
details of the work were done by a paid and trained staff
of permanent officials.</p>
  <p><note place="foot" n="4">The Ministers of State.</note>In old days finance had been managed by a Lord High
Treasurer and a Chancellor of the Exchequer, the navy by
a Lord High Admiral, and the legal system by
a Lord High Chancellor.  The deliberative
executive body was the Privy Council under its President,


<pb id="p.227" n="227"/>





and the two Principal Secretaries of State were the
recognised go-betweens between king and the people. After
the Revolution great changes set in. The Privy Council
gave way to the Cabinet. The great offices of State were
(except the Chancellorship) put into commission. After
the accession of <persName key="George I.">George I.</persName> there were no more Treasurers,
but several Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, of whom
the First Lord was always practically Prime Minister,
though the law of the Constitution knew as little of a
Premier as of a Cabinet. This change made the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, who now generally led the Commons
if the Prime Minister were in the Upper House, responsible
for the annual budget, or statement of ways and means for
the year. The First Lord of the Admiralty similarly
replaces the Lord High Admiral, except during William of
<persName key="William IV.">Clarence</persName>'s brief and unlucky tenure of the office. The
number of Secretaries of State (who must be carefully
distinguished from other Secretaries of less dignity, such
as. the Secretary-at- War) was gradually increased, and,
though remaining in theory equally competent to
transact any business, they became in practice limited to a
special department. From <date value="1708">1708</date> to <date value="1746">1746</date> there was a Scotch
Secretary, though his office was then divided among the
two other Secretaries, who had from an early period been
called the Secretaries for the Northern and Southern
Departments. In <date value="1768">1768</date> a Third Secretary for the Colonial and
American Department was appointed, but the office was
abolished in <date value="1782">1782</date> as part of the plan of Economical Reform.
In <date value="1782">1782</date> a new division was made, and the Secretaries
became respectively the Home (and Colonial) Secretary and
the Secretary for Foreign Affairs. But in <date value="1794">1794</date> the Third
Secretaryship was revived as the Secretaryship for War
and (after <date value="1801">1801</date>) for the Colonies as well. In <date value="1854">1854</date> the War
Department was separated from the Colonial, and a Fourth
Secretary for the Colonies empowered. In <date value="1858">1858</date> the
annexation of <placeName key="India">India</placeName> to the Crown brought about the Fifth or
Indian Secretaryship of State, instead of the Presidentship
of the Board of Control, established in <date value="1784">1784</date>, as a sort of
Indian ministry.</p>
  <p>Other departments were also established. <persName key="Charles II.">Charles II.</persName>'s
Council of Trade and Plantations became, in <date value="1695">1695</date>, the
Board of Trade, according to <persName key="Paterson, William">William Paterson</persName>'s plan,
which was abolished by <persName key="Burke, Edmund">Burke</persName> in <date value="1782">1782</date>, but revived in
<date value="1786">1786</date> as a Committee of Council, which, under its President,
grew bit by bit in independence, power, and importance.


<pb id="p.228" n="228"/>





In <date value="1834">1834</date> a Poor Law Board was set up, which in <date value="1871">1871</date> was
transferred to the Local Government Board, whose
President is now generally a Cabinet minister. An Education
Department has grown up since <date value="1839">1839</date> from a Committee of
the Privy Council, which in <date value="1853">1853</date> received a special
organisation, and in <date value="1856">1856</date> was brought under a Vice-President of
the Council, who shared with the Lord President the duties
of Education Minister. Thus some of the old administrative
powers of the Council came back to it. It has also by
Commissioners the control of all Civil Service appointments.</p>
  <p>After <date value="1851">1851</date> a First Commissioner of Works and Buildings
was appointed. The Lord Privy Seal and the Chancellor
of the Duchy of Lancaster still continued as nominal officers
with little work.  Recently the Scotch Secretaryship has
been revived, and a Minister for Agriculture has just
been established. The Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland has
gradually become mainly occupied with the ceremonial
duties of the mock Court at Dublin. The responsible Irish
minister is now for practical purposes the Chief Secretary
to the Lord-Lieutenant, a post which recent events have
rendered of very great importance.</p>
  <p><note place="foot" n="5">The Permanent Civil Service.</note>Under each minister has gradually grown up a large
department with extensive offices and a large staff of trained
clerks and officials, with a permanent non-
political Under Secretary at the head of each,
who, from his long experience, cannot but exercise very
great power, especially when, as often happens, his political
chief has no special knowledge of the work of his department.
Fortunately the English Civil Service has always
been <quote>"non-political"</quote>; that is, non-party and permanent.
This does a great deal to balance the evils of party
government, though it has dangers of its own in the liability of
officials to be enslaved by red tape and routine. Of late
years entrance into the Civil Service has mostly been by
open competition.</p>
  <p>4. <note place="foot" n="6">Local Government.</note>Local government became increasingly complicated,
as new bodies were created, with great carelessness for
system, to discharge new functions.  In the
English counties the local government remained
with the Quarter Sessions of the Justices of the Peace, a
class largely made up of the landed gentry.  But in
borough towns throughout the kingdom the Corporations
exercised a local self-government, which has recently been
restored to the country districts of England and Scotland


<pb id="p.229" n="229"/>




by means of popularly-elected County Councils, and had
already been extended to populous places through Local
Boards of Health. Elective Parish and District Councils
have also been set up, and have done something, but not
everything, towards reducing the waste, chaos, and
confusion that sprang inevitably from so many clashing jurisdictions. In Ireland the Grand Jury, composed of persons
such as in England are Justices of the Peace and sit at
Quarter Sessions, is just superseded by County Councils as
in England.</p>
  <p>5. <note place="foot" n="7">The Army.</note>The army which fought so bravely under <persName key="Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke">Wellington</persName>
is described by its own general as recruited from the <quote>"scum
of the earth, the most drunken and worst men
in every village,"</quote> and was only kept in discipline
by flogging and sternness during the twenty-one years of
service. The officers were mostly high-spirited gentlemen,
ignorant of the art of war till they came face to face with an
enemy, and in time of peace idle and as lacking in discipline
as their men. The army administration was a marvel of
complication and inefficiency. The Commander-in-Chief,
the mouthpiece of the king, was the military head of cavalry
and infantry, but could do nothing involving expense without the leave of the Secretary-at- War, a member of the
Government responsible for the army estimates and finances.
But the artillery and engineers were not under the Commander-in-Chief, but under the Board of Ordnance and its
Master-General, and the home militia was ruled by the
Lords-Lieutenant of the counties, who looked to the Home
Office for their orders. The Commissariat was dependent
on the Treasury. When war broke out all military operations were controlled by the Secretary of State for War
and the Colonies.</p>
  <p>After the peace of <date value="1815">1815</date>, the army was still looked on with
some of the old jealousy, and <persName key="Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke">Wellington</persName> sought to hide it
away in small bodies to prevent it getting too conspicuous.
The old system went on all through the long peace, and
finally collapsed in the needless miseries which it brought
upon our army in the Crimean war. Reforms were then
introduced. A new Secretary of State for War was appointed to discharge the work of the former Secretary of
State, the Secretary-at-War, and the Master of the Ordnance. But the dual system of the Commander-in-Chief
and his office at the Horse Guards, and the War Secretary
at the War Office in Pall Mall, still led to confusion, as
every attempt to bring the general under the statesman was


<pb id="p.230" n="230"/>





resisted as an attack on the prerogative. At last <persName key="Cardwell, Edward">Cardwell</persName>'s
reforms in <date value="1870">1870</date> and <date value="1872">1872</date> laid the foundations of the present
army system. The command of all forces, regulars, militia,
volunteers, and all, was brought under the
Commander-in-Chief.  Purchase of commissions was got rid of, and the
officers were required to go through an education in military
science at Sandhurst or Woolwich.  The Staff was improved, the Transport and Commissariat arrangements
brought into some sort of order. Short service was introduced, seven years with the colours, and five, now six, with
the reserve. Before long, the army was localised-that is,
every regiment had its depot fixed in some county from
which it took its name, and included, besides at least two
battalions of the line, both the militia and volunteers of the
district. The Minie and Enfield rifle, with its percussion
lock, superseded the smooth-barrelled, flint-locked, old
<quote>"Brown Bess,"</quote> which would not fire straight over 150 yards,
just in time for the Crimean war, and has, since <date value="1867">1867</date>, been
superseded by breechloading rifles. The number of field
artillery has been much increased. Pains have been taken to
make the soldier's life more attractive, and to raise the tone
of the soldiers.  Flogging has been abolished altogether.
The army, which in <date value="1818">1818</date> was 80,000 strong, now consists of
about 200,000 men, with a reserve of 80,000, besides 100,000
militia, and over 200,000 volunteers; but the organisation
is still somewhat incomplete, the divided authority still stands
in the way of reform, and it would be impossible to mobilise
at all fast.</p>
  <p>6. <note place="foot" n="8">The Navy</note>Greater changes have taken place in the navy, though
that force was never allowed to drop so low as the army
between <dateRange from="1815" to="1854">1815 and 1854</dateRange>, and we always had a
fairly efficient system of naval administration
under the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. The
introduction of steam brought about the first revolution.
But it was very long before steam was thought a practicable
way of propelling warships. In <date value="1837">1837</date> the few steamers in
the royal navy were small despatch paddle-boats not
intended for fighting. After <date value="1843">1843</date>, a number of wooden
frigates and corvettes were built with screw propellers, while
<quote>" auxiliary screws"</quote> were also fitted on to many ships already
built. The navies which did so little in the Crimean War
were driven by steam, though they kept the general appearance, rigging, arms, and structure of the old line-of-battle
ships.  Their inability to fight against shore fortifications
led to the building of some batteries protected by 4(3/4)-inch

plates of iron, a system first taken up by the French, but
soon adopted by us. These first ironclads did good service in
bombarding Kinburn.    Before long iron armour was
also adopted for vessels of a sea-going character, and the
improvements in the iron manufacture soon caused all large
ships to be built with iron, and latterly with steel. Masts
and sails almost disappeared along with the graceful lines
of the old man-of-war. A large number of small cannon
were replaced by a few very heavy and powerful guns; and
ships grew bigger and the armour-plating thicker as the
guns were made heavier and more powerful. Improvements in the steam-engine made it possible to move these
unwieldy monsters at a speed of sixteen or seventeen miles
an hour. Latterly torpedoes have become very prominent
in naval warfare.</p>
   <p>The condition of sailors changed with the change of the
type of their ships. Much smaller crews are now required,
and a large proportion of them are engineers and stokers,
with nothing to do with navigation or fighting. But greater
care was in many ways paid to the sailors' health and well-
being, though many modern battle-ships are but sorry substitutes in comfort and convenience for the old wooden walls.
The brutal system of impressment dropped out of use. The
navy is now recruited from boys in training-ships, who
serve from eighteen onwards for twelve years. A Naval
Reserve from the merchant service has recently been organised. Great efforts have lately been made to enlarge and
improve the navy.</p>
   <p>7. <note place="foot" n="9">State of the Church early in the century.</note>The general condition of the Church early in the cen tury was not very high. Many of the bishops were either
 noblemen, noblemen's tutors, or distinguished
 scholars, and some of them greedy, lazy, and
 indifferent to their spiritual duties. Scandalous
 lives and drunkenness were not rare among the parochial
 clergy, and even among the rest there was more decorum
 than hard work and zeal. Non-residence was shamefully
 common, and increased after an Act in <date value="1802">1802</date> gave the
 bishops power to give or withhold licences not to reside.
 The poet <persName key="Crabbe, George">Crabbe</persName> describes a type of country clergyman that
 was still sometimes to be found :-
          <quote rend="blockquote"><l>"A jovial youth who thinks his Sunday task</l>
          <l>As much as God or man can fairly ask;</l>
          <l>The rest he gives to loves and labours light,</l>
          <l>To fields the morning and to feasts the night;</l>
          <l>None better skilled the noisy pack to guide,</l>
          <l>To urge their chase, to cheer them or to chide;</l>


<pb id="p.232" n="232"/>





         <l>A sportsman keen, he shoots through half the day,</l>
         <l>And, skilled at whist, devotes the night to play."</l></quote></p>
  <p>Such men were often good-natured, honest, and kindly,
but the clergy <quote>"as a body were secular in their habits,
though above the level of general society."</quote> <quote>" The expulsion
of the poor from the churches," </quote>says a great High-Church
statesman, <quote>"the mutilations of the fabrics, the horrors of
the Church music, and the coldness and indifference of the
lounging or stooping congregations would shock a Brahman
or a Buddhist."</quote></p>
  <p>The Evangelicals, led by the devout Charles Simeon of
Cambridge (<dateRange from="1759" to="1836">1759-1836</dateRange>), were the most active section of the
clergy.  But the <quote>"Evangelical party,"</quote> properly so called,
was not very numerous, and as a rule not very influential
throughout the country, though its teaching gave colour
to many outside their own body. They were also looked
on with great suspicion by orthodox old-fashioned High-
Churchmen. But they did much good work, and careers
like that of Henry Martyn, the missionary to <placeName key="India">India</placeName> (<dateRange from="1781" to="1821">1781-1821</dateRange>),
showed that Evangelical views could inspire noble
self-devotion and unselfish Christian zeal. But they worked
too much by themselves to inspire the whole nation with
their spirit, for they chiefly aimed at advancing spiritual
life in the individual rather than the spiritual development
of the Church as an institution, and their peculiar methods
were not always attractive to persons of education and
culture.  To them is largely due the cry for the new
churches, which, helped by large Government grants, now
grew up in the large towns, the movement in London owing
much to the zealous Charles James Blomfield, bishop
between <dateRange from="1828" to="1856">1828 and 1856</dateRange>.</p>
  <p>There was still much bigotry, and the Church clung hard
to its old exclusive privileges, and set itself against needful
reforms. The emancipation of the Roman Catholics in
<date value="1829">1829</date> was not popular, though many bishops voted for it.
But practically all the bishops opposed the Reform Bill, and
the Church seemed so unpopular that the Reformed Parliament, it was thought, would make short work of it altogether. The strongest bishop, Phillpotts of Exeter, led a
fierce opposition to all reform. The very moderate proposals of the Whigs, especially their Irish Church policy,
filled many with the greatest alarm.</p>
  <p>8. A few years before the Reform  Bill, Oriel College,
which had thrown open its Fellowships, became the centre
of intellectual life in Oxford.  It was also the seat of a


<pb id="p.233" n="233"/>



liberal theological movement, <note place="foot" n="10">The Tractarian Movement, <dateRange from="1833" to="1845">1833-45</dateRange>.</note>
led by Edward Copleston, the Provost (Bishop of Llandaff in <date value="1827">1827</date>);
Richard Whately, a haughty and terror-inspiring logician (Arch-
bishop of Dublin in <date value="1831">1831</date>); Renn Dickson Hampden
(Bishop of Hereford in <date value="1847">1847</date>), writer of
Bampton Lectures that few read but many denounced as
unsound; and <persName key="Arnold, Thomas">Thomas Arnold</persName>, the reformer of public
school education, and headmaster of Rugby after <date value="1827">1827</date>.
But the removal of the Liberals to other work brought
forward some younger Fellows of the college of a very
different way of thinking. Among these were John <persName key="Keble, John">Keble</persName>
(<dateRange from="1792" to="1866">1792-1866</dateRange>), after <date value="1835">1835</date> Vicar of Hursley in Hampshire, a
shy, retiring poet, whose sweet and graceful Christian Year
had first appeared in <date value="1827">1827</date>; Edward  Bouverie Pusey (<dateRange from="1800" to="1882">1800-1882</dateRange>),
Professor of Hebrew since <date value="1828">1828</date>, and a man of
caution, learning, wealth, and social position; and above
all John Henry <persName key="Newman, John Henry">Newman</persName> (born <date value="1801">1801</date>), Vicar of St. Mary's,
<quote>"a thin pale man, with large lustrous eyes, and a slight
bend forwards,"</quote> whose <quote>" subtle and sympathetic mind was a
ferment of emotion, speculation, and yearning for truth."</quote> To
this little band the Church outlook seemed very gloomy,
and <persName key="Keble, John">Keble</persName> sounded the note of alarm by a sermon on
National Apostasy, on 14th July <date value="1833">1833</date>, a day ever regarded
by <persName key="Newman, John Henry">Newman</persName> as the starting-point of the new religious
movement. The little knot of like-minded men met
together and resolved to <quote>"revive through the press the
doctrines of the Church, the Ministry, and the Sacraments.
The result was the Tracts for the Times,"</quote> which were
received with violent enthusiasm by a few, and by a howl of
reprobation by the many. But the movement spread, connecting itself with the leaders of the old High Church
party, which had always had a considerable following among
the clergy, and was then upheld by Hugh James Rose,
Principal of King's College, London, between <dateRange from="1836" to="1839">1836 and 1839</dateRange>,
Walter Farquhar Hook, Vicar of Leeds between
<dateRange from="1837" to="1859">1837 and 1859</dateRange>, and Henry Phillpotts, Bishop of Exeter
between <dateRange from="1831" to="1869">1831 and 1869</dateRange>.  By the end of <date value="1837">1837</date> the High
Church revival had become general. But the outcry against
the Tracts grew until it came to a head in the storm excited
by Tract Ninety, in which <persName key="Newman, John Henry">Newman</persName> sought to prove that the
loose language of the Thirty-Nine Articles made it possible
for English Churchmen to hold some form of the mediaeval
doctrines which they seem specially to condemn. The
crisis soon came. The Tracts were stopped, and <persName key="Newman, John Henry">Newman</persName>
withdrew from active teaching. In <date value="1843">1843</date> Pusey was


<pb id="p.234" n="234"/>





suspended for advocating extreme views bearing on the doctrine
of the Real Presence in a sermon. William George Ward was
deprived of his degree for going even beyond the doctrine
of Tract XC. in his Ideal of a Christian Church. But some
of the leaders had gone so far that they began to doubt
whether the Church of England standpoint had any logical
basis. At last in <date value="1845">1845</date> <persName key="Newman, John Henry">Newman</persName> became a convert to the
Roman Church, and was followed by Ward and many others
of his ablest and most enthusiastic disciples.</p>
   <p>9. <note place="foot" n="11">High Churchmen.</note>The Tractarian movement proper ends with the secession of its greatest genius, but the mass of the party stood
firm under the quiet and diplomatic leadership
of Dr. Pusey, from whom they were often called
Puseyites, though they chose to style themselves the
Catholic school. The impulse which the Tractarians gave
lived on, and, becoming more practical and less intellectual,
brought about a very general revival of Church life and feeling. <note place="foot" n="12">Ritualists.</note>One further result was a fresh study of mediaeval art
and practices which led up to the revival of the symbolical
ritual of the middle ages, and gave the extreme
following the nickname of Ritualists, though
 the great teachers laid all the stress on dogma, and
 cared little for mere outward forms.  Despite much
 opposition and great outcries of No Popery, the noble
 lives and devotion of many of the Ritualist leaders spread
 their teaching among the people, and procured for them
 a practical toleration, though they have sometimes gone to
 lengths not easy to reconcile with the Church's teaching.
 Yet the attempts to put them down have all failed, and none
 more signally than <persName key="Disraeli, Benjamin">Disraeli</persName>'s Public Worship Regulation
 Act of <date value="1874">1874</date>. The Bennett judgment of the Court of Arches
 in <date value="1870">1870</date> definitely permitted the teaching of the most dis tinctive doctrine of the new High Churchmen. <note place="foot" n="13">Evangelicals.</note>Meanwhile
 the Evangelical or Low Church party continued to flourish,
 though it began to show signs of losing its power of spreading
 more widely. In <date value="1850">1850</date> the Gorham judgment had given the same toleration to its dogmatic teaching as the Bennett judgment afterwards did to
that of its rivals. A new school of Liberal or Latitudinarian Churchmanship revived the spirit of Tillotson
and Burnet. The opinions of Whately were too hard and
logical to have much influence outside universities, but the
influence of the poet and thinker, Samuel Taylor <persName key="Coleridge, Samuel">Coleridge</persName>,
inspired men of active and enthusiastic temperament, like
Frederick Denison <persName key="Maurice, Frederick Denison">Maurice</persName> (<dateRange from="1805" to="1872">1805-1872</dateRange>) and Frederick

Robertson of Brighton (<dateRange from="1816" to="1853">1816-1853</dateRange>), to build up a theology to
suit the needs of modern thought, and disciples like Charles Kingsley
(<dateRange from="1819" to="1875">1819-1875</dateRange>), Rector of Eversley,
novelist, poet, clergyman, and social reformer,
to carry their teachings into practice. <note place="foot" n="14">Broad Churchmen.</note>They were looked
upon with great suspicion by lovers of the old ways, and
in <date value="1853">1853</date> <persName key="Maurice, Frederick Denison">Maurice</persName> was unjustly turned out of his professorship
at King's College, London. But gradually they won a position for themselves, and all the outcry against the more outspoken advocacy of new ways by some of the seven writers
of a book called Essays and Reviews, published in <date value="1861">1861</date>, did
not secure the conviction for heresy of Dr. Rowland
Williams, Vice-Principal of St. David's College, Lampeter,
before the Privy Council. So each of the Church parties got
some sort of legal recognition as well as practical toleration.
Some evil has resulted from the stronger growth of party
cries, but also a good deal of activity and energy, which
has not altogether limited itself to sectional channels.</p>
  <p>10. <note place="foot" n="15">Revival of Churchlife.</note>The increased activity and usefulness of the Church
has been helped forward by all parties, and by men who
have avoided party altogether.  Organisation
has been improved, and vast sums spent on
building new churches and repairing old ones. Within the
last fifty years more than 3000 new parishes have been
created, mostly under <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName>'s Church Building Acts. The
Ecclesiastical Commission, set up in <date value="1836">1836</date>, has done a great
deal towards the better management and more equal distribution of the Church estates. Nine new sees-Ripon,
<placeName key="Manchester">Manchester</placeName>, St. Albans, Truro, Newcastle, <placeName key="Liverpool">Liverpool</placeName>,
Southwell, Wakefield, and Bristol-have been established;
many suffragans have been consecrated, and a whole hierarchy of bishops of the flourishing series of Colonial churches
set on foot, so that in <date value="1878">1878</date> ninety-five Anglican prelates
met together in a Pan-Anglican Synod, and a still larger
number in <date value="1888">1888</date>.</p>
  <p>In <date value="1854">1854</date> Convocation was again allowed to sit to transact
business, an act mainly procured through the zeal, activity,
and tact of Samuel <persName key="Wilberforce, Samuel">Wilberforce</persName> (<dateRange from="1805" to="1873">1805-1873</dateRange>),   Bishop of Oxford and afterwards of Winchester, the son of William
<persName key="Wilberforce, William">Wilberforce</persName>, and the leading bishop of his time. But as
Convocation is not a very representative body, voluntary
Congresses and Councils have been gathered together to get
at Church opinion more fully. Meanwhile the Church has
not neglected its more definite spiritual work, and the tone
and character of public worship have been largely raised.


<pb id="p.236" n="236"/>





Something has been accomplished towards bringing the
Church into harmony with the growth of democratic feeling
in the nation, though much still remains to be done. All
through the century the Established Church has been, little
by little, losing its old invidious supremacy, and has had to
justify itself by its work. It has so far succeeded that it is
much better liked and does much more work than in the
days of the Reform Bill. Even in districts like Wales and
Cornwall, where the Church was once at a low ebb, its
prospects are brightening.  In the towns its position is
incomparably stronger.</p>
  <p>11. <note place="foot" n="16">The Protestant Nonconformists.</note>The nineteenth century has gradually witnessed not
only the sweeping away of the large number of odious disabilities once imposed upon Nonconformity,
but a distinct growth of the spirit of toleration,
which is quite a different thing. In <date value="1828">1828</date> and
<date value="1829">1829</date> the worst of the old restrictions were removed.  In
<date value="1836">1836</date> Dissenters were allowed to be married in their own
chapels or before a registrar, and to record the births of
their children in a less invidious way than taking them to
church to be baptized. In <date value="1858">1858</date> Jews were admitted to sit
in Parliament.  In <date value="1868">1868</date> <persName key="Gladstone, William E.">Gladstone</persName> abolished compulsory
Church Rates. In <date value="1871">1871</date> religious tests were got rid of at
Oxford and Cambridge. In <date value="1880">1880</date> burials were allowed in
parish churchyards <quote>"with any Christian and orderly religious
service."</quote></p>
  <p>Nonconformist bodies have grown in numbers, wealth,
influence, and organisation. The Wesleyans have gradually
drifted from their old half-way position into the place of a
new Dissenting Church, and several distinct organisations
have broken off from the parent connexion, of which perhaps the most important are the Primitive Methodists, a
sect established in <date value="1801">1801</date> by <persName key="Bourne, Hugh">Hugh Bourne</persName>, and very strong
among certain sections of the agricultural poor. The tendency to further organisation has brought together into
a Congregational Union and a Baptist Union bodies of
Christians whose first principle was that each individual
church was a self-governing independent community. Of
late years a zealous but strange body called the Salvation
Army has won for itself great influence. A great change of
feeling has led to the conversion of the mass of Nonconformists to what is called the Voluntary Principle, and to
the belief that the State should have nothing to do with
religion. The Irish Church Act of <date value="1869">1869</date> has been their
greatest victory.</p>


<pb id="p.237" n="237"/>





  <p>12. <note place="foot" n="17">The Roman Catholics.</note>Another feature of the century has been the great
growth of the Roman Catholic Church in England, beginning with the repeal of the old repressive laws
against it, and helped forward by the secession
of <persName key="Newman, John Henry">Newman</persName> (Cardinal in <date value="1879">1879</date>) and so many of his followers,
the longing of many quiet souls to find rest from a troubled
and sceptical age in the bosom of an infallible Church, and
by the large migrations of Irish to the English and Scotch
great towns. In <date value="1850">1850</date> a regular hierarchy of twelve bishops,
with new titles taken from great towns, under the Archbishop of Westminster, was set up, which, though much
resented by Protestants at the time as a Papal Aggression,
was not put down by <persName key="Russell, John">Russell</persName>'s abortive Ecclesiastical Titles
Bill. A similar territorial episcopate has since been introduced among the Roman Catholics of Scotland.</p>
  <p>13. <note place="foot" n="18">The Scotch Church.</note>In Scotland there grew up early in the century the
same zeal for ecclesiastical independence which marked the
High Church revival in England. The Evangelical party gradually won back a majority in
the General Assembly under the leadership of Dr. Thomas
<persName key="Chalmers, Thomas">Chalmers</persName> (<date value="1780">1780</date>-<date value="1847">1847</date>), a great preacher, pastor, and teacher,
and a man, says <persName key="Carlyle, Thomas">Carlyle</persName>, <quote>"of great modesty, much natural
dignity, ingenuity, honesty, and affection, as well as sound
intellect and imagination, very eminent vivacity, and bursts
of genuine fun."</quote> <note place="foot" n="19">The Ten Years' Conflict, <dateRange from="1834" to="1843">1834-43</dateRange>.</note>In <date value="1834">1834</date> the Evangelicals
carried in the Assembly the Veto Act, which gave
the male heads of families the right of refusing
the appointments of ministers made by the patrons. This
revived the old controversies which had brought about
several schisms in the preceding century. Patrons denied
the legality of the Veto Act, and in <date value="1838">1838</date> the Court of Session in the Auchterarder Case decided in their favour. A
great contest now broke out between Church and State.
The Assembly tried to coerce the Presbytery of Strathbogie
which had obeyed the law-courts and disobeyed the
Church authority, and much bitter feeling was stirred
up. The <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName> ministry was ignorant or careless, and
did little to help over the difficulty. <note place="foot" n="20">Foundation of the Free Church of Scotland, <date value="1843">1843</date>.</note>At last the Ten

of the congregations followed them, and in
some parts, particularly in the Highlands, the

Established Churches remained almost deserted, and to this day
the Church of Scotland, though of late years much
strengthened, has ceased to contain the majority of the
population. The withdrawal of the hottest champions of
seventeenth-century orthodoxy gave more room for the
liberal movement in the Church, which in itself became a
fresh ground of difference. In <date value="1874">1874</date> the Patronage Act of
<date value="1712">1712</date> was repealed, but it was too late to be of much use,
and Scottish Presbyterianism remains split up into different
camps. <note place="foot" n="21">The United Presbyterians <date value="1847">1847</date>.</note>Some of the older secessions were in <date value="1847">1847</date> joined
together to form the United Presbyterian Church, mostly
distinguished from the Free Church by its upholding as a theory the <quote>" Voluntary Principle."</quote>
But of late years a strong party within the Free
Church has given up the ideals of the Covenanters, and
has declared for disestablishment.  As in England, the
growth of religious differences was in some ways compensated by more earnest rivalry in spiritual work.</p>
  <p>14. <note place="foot" n="22">Material growth.</note>In the early years of the nineteenth century the chief
English industries were somewhat languishing, yet between
<dateRange from="1801" to="1831">1801 and 1831</dateRange> the manufacturing population
increased by over thirty per cent. The improvement sprang from the gradual bringing in of Free Trade by
<persName key="Huskisson, William">Huskisson</persName> and <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName>. Between <dateRange from="1837" to="1887">1837 and 1887</dateRange> the population of the United Kingdom has run up from 25,600,000
to 37,000,000, and that despite the large falling-off in Ireland, and the stationary or declining numbers of the purely
agricultural districts. Wealth has grown ever more rapidly.
The coal trade has increased fourfold, and the iron trade
has found new centres at Barrow and Middlesbrough, and
increased nearly eightfold. The cotton, woollen, and linen
trades have doubled, and the value of the exports mounted
up from   &#x00A3; 45,000,000 to  &#x00A3; 270,000,000.  The national
revenue,  &#x00A3; 52,000,000 in <date value="1816">1816</date>, was about &#x00A3;60,000,000 in
<date value="1837">1837</date>, and in <date value="1887">1887</date> about  &#x00A3; 90,000,000. Prices fell as goods
could be made more easily, and raw materials could
be bought in the cheapest markets, and this benefited
every one.  Artisans and professional men earned better
salaries, and the income-tax returns showed a steady increase
in the number of people comfortably well off. Owing to
increase of railways, the call for greater food-supplies to the
towns, and the high price of meat, rents rose, and despite
the repeal of the Corn Laws, farmers and landlords continued as prosperous as the manufacturer and tradesman.
But of recent times the growth of foreign competition, in meat


<pb id="p.239" n="239"/>





as well as corn, has cut down the profits of English agriculture, and made corn-growing one of the least profitable
forms of employment, while the great national States that
have grown up on the Continent are proving much more
dangerous rivals to England's manufactures than the smaller
and less organised communities that preceded them. Yet
the volume of British trade does not fall off, and wages have
risen slowly, though prices decline. Manufacturers no longer
make colossal fortunes so quickly, and capitalists have to be
contented with a smaller percentage of interest, and traders
with a diminished margin of profit. Each change brings
about great disturbances and difficulties, but as things
settle down it seems likely that though England can never
expect to get back the position she once bade fair to obtain,
as the one great manufacturing and commercial nation in
the world, she has no reason to fear, for being every whit as
well situated as her competitors, she is likely to retain a
very large share of the world's business.</p>
  <p>15. <note place="foot" n="23">Inventions.</note>There is nothing quite so striking in the annals of nineteenth century inventions as the story of the great discoveries
which made the Industrial Revolution possible,
yet all sorts of machinery became elaborated
with a subtlety, detail, and scientific knowledge to which
the eighteenth-century inventors were strangers, and man's
control over matter wonderfully increased.  Enormous
results flowed from discoveries like the Bessemer process
for making cheap steel. New machines and methods made
the increased volume of trade possible, yet so long as inland
communications did not improve, it was hard for very rapid
progress to be made.  The canals became choked with
traffic, and the canal companies, having a monopoly, raised
their rates, and handled their traffic as slowly as they chose.
The horse-tramways were rare outside the colliery districts,
and road transit was too expensive.</p>

proved little better than toys. At last, in <date value="1802">1802</date>,
William Symington navigated a steam tugboat on the Forth and Clyde Canal. In <date value="1807">1807</date> the American

utilisation of the screw, made steam navigation possible for
large ocean-going vessels. The same process of improve

steam navigation has now become so cheap that steamers
bid fair to almost supersede sailing-ships.</p>
  <p>17. <note place="foot" n="25">Steam Railways.</note>In <date value="1769">1769</date> a Frenchman named Cugnot built a locomotive engine for ordinary roads.  In <date value="1802">1802</date> Richard
Trevithick, a Cornish mining captain, took out
a patent for a locomotive, and in <date value="1803">1803</date> an engine
of his was used at Penydarren, near Merthyr. In <date value="1812">1812</date>
Blenkinsop, near Leeds, and Blackett at Wylam, near
Newcastle, regularly used steam locomotives to take down
coals from the pit mouth; and in <date value="1814">1814</date> rough, shrewd George
Stephenson (<dateRange from="1781" to="1848">1781-1848</dateRange>), a Wylam fireman's son, ran his
first engine on the Killingworth Colliery Railway, with such
success that in <date value="1820">1820</date> he started an engine factory at Newcastle. In <date value="1825">1825</date> the Stockton and Darlington Railway was
opened, largely through the efforts of the Quaker Edward
Pease, and one of Stephenson's engines drew a train of
thirty-eightwagons at a rate of about six miles an hour, though
for some years horses were used more than locomotives, the
one passenger coach, the Experiment, being always drawn
by a horse. Meanwhile a new railway was constructed from
<placeName key="Liverpool">Liverpool</placeName> to <placeName key="Manchester">Manchester</placeName>, and the success of Stephenson's
engine the Rocket led to the introduction of locomotives as
the ordinary means of working it. In <date value="1830">1830</date> the opening of
the railway was, as we have seen, made memorable by
<persName key="Huskisson, William">Huskisson</persName>'s tragic death. But lovers of old ways looked
askance on the new and mysterious mode of motion, and
the most that was expected from it was stirring up the
canal companies by competition, passenger transport being
hardly thought of. New railways gradually grew up. In
<date value="1836">1836</date> the period of experiment came to an end, and railway
construction on a large scale began;  In <date value="1839">1839</date> Robert
Stephenson (the son of George) built the London and
Birmingham line, on which the first train ran at twenty
miles an hour. This line was soon connected with the
<placeName key="Liverpool">Liverpool</placeName> and <placeName key="Manchester">Manchester</placeName> by the Grand Junction Railway.
Isambard K. Brunel laid down the Great Western. But
there were still grave doubts as to the respective merits of
locomotives, stationary engines working a cable, and the
atmospheric system, and the Battle of the gauges was not
over until <date value="1845">1845</date>, when the amalgamation of the broad gauge
(7 foot) Bristol and Gloucester line with the narrow gauge
(4 feet 8(1/2) inches) Midland, led to the general adoption of
the cheaper and easier width, and left the Great Western,
which alone upheld the broad gauge, out in the cold.

In <date value="1844">1844</date> came the Railway Mania, when over 8000 miles
of line were sanctioned in three years, and wide excitement
and reckless speculation in railway shares produced a long
depression and ruined many honest people, while rogues
grew fat from ill-gotten gain, though some speculators, like
George Hudson, the Railway King, lost their fortune as
rapidly as they had won it. Meanwhile a series of giant
private monopolies got the control of the communications
into their own hands, for it was soon found impossible to
regard a railway as a high-road on which anybody might
run if he paid the tolls, and the State shrank from the risk
and cost of buying up the companies. Bit by bit they
were brought under some sort of State control, the first
Railway Commission being constituted in <date value="1846">1846</date>. Meanwhile
the companies grew stronger by amalgamation, while competition gradually increased the speed of trains, and gave
greater facilities to the humbler traveller.</p>
  <p>18. <note place="foot" n="26">Telegraphs.</note>In <date value="1816">1816</date> Francis Ronalds of Hammersmith invented
the electric telegraph, and offered it to the Admiralty in vain.
And now in <date value="1837">1837</date> Cooke and Wheatstone took
out their patent for this invention, and what
had hitherto been a scientific experiment became a practical
fact. Yet for many years telegraphs were but little used.
It was not till <date value="1843">1843</date> that the first public telegraph office was
opened. But in <date value="1857">1857</date> an effort was made to lay a submarine
cable between England and America, though it was not
until <date value="1866">1866</date> that it was successful.  In <date value="1870">1870</date> the British
telegraphs were bought up by the State, and, with the
cheapening of the tariff and the increase of public facilities,
became for the first time widely and generally used. About
<date value="1880">1880</date> the telephone became utilised. But whatever may be
the future, the age of steam is not yet over, and the age
of electricity is still to come.  The result of all the great
inventions was that it became infinitely easier and cheaper
to spread information, communicate directions, and get
about; less expensive to move heavy goods and machines,
and harder to keep up the old barriers which cut off place
from place.  Markets became wider, travel infinitely extended; though whether these inventions have tended to advance human happiness must long be an unsettled question.</p>
  <p>19. <note place="foot" n="27">Condition of the People.</note>Early in the century the terrible cruelties and evils
of the early Factory system still went on unheeded, while
the agricultural labourer was a helpless and
spiritless serf.  The worst horrors of the apprenticeship system had been redressed by the elder <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName>


<pb id="p.242" n="242"/>





in <date value="1802">1802</date>, but the great mills of the north were still largely
worked by miserable child labourers, <quote>"confined in close
and heated rooms, stunned with the roar of revolving wheels,
poisoned with the noxious effluvia of grease and gas, until
turned out, weary, exhausted, and half naked, to the cold air,
to creep shivering to their beds, from which a relay of their
young fellow-workers had just risen."</quote> Still worse horrors
were wrought in coal-mines, where small children laboured
for weary hours in darkness and solitude on dry bread.
Even the able-bodied labourer had a wretched time.
Between <dateRange from="1810" to="1845">1810 and 1845</dateRange> the workmen in the midland hosiery
trade hardly earned seven shillings a week when they could
get employment, and a widespread practice grew up of
stilling the cravings of hunger by doses of opium. Still
worse was the chronic distress of the ill-clad and ill-fed
hand-loom weavers. Skilled workmen in constant work
found bare life a hard struggle. Even the New Poor Law
of <date value="1834">1834</date>, which marks the beginning of the improvement of
the agricultural poor, at first brought with it some new evils
of its own. Drunkenness, brutality, immorality, and ignorance were the natural fruits of such a system.</p>
  <p>20. <note place="foot" n="28">Robert Owen, <dateRange from="1771" to="1858">1771-1858</dateRange>.</note>Such horrors drove Robert Owen, a saddler's son
from Newtown in Montgomeryshire, who, when still a shy
awkward youth, had shown such business gifts
as would surely have led him to fortune, to turn
his warm imagination, keen sympathy, and deep enthusiasm
from the pursuit of greater wealth to improving the condition of the workers, and to brilliant schemes for the
regeneration of society. The great cotton mills at New
Lanark on the Clyde, of which he became manager and
part proprietor by his marriage in <date value="1799">1799</date>, became under his
care the wonder of philanthropists, with their night schools,
infant schools, and improved workmen's dwellings.  He
gave the first impulse to Factory Legislation, and was the
founder of English Co-operation. But the times were dark,
and he gradually came to believe that <quote>"the whole
fabric of society was based on a fundamental error."</quote>
<note place="foot" n="29">Socialism and Co-operation.</note>About <date value="1820">1820</date> he started a wild scheme of Socialism,
believing that salvation would only come if men lived
together in large square villages and had all things in
common. For a time he exerted enormous influence, the
Chartists in particular owing much to his teaching. But
his Socialism turned out a failure, and his fantastic Labour
Exchange was quite unworkable. His fierce hostility to
Christianity lost him some of his best fellow-workers, and,


<pb id="p.243" n="243"/>



as things grew better, he ceased to be a power in the
land, though he had given the impulse to some of the
greatest movements of the century.</p>
  <p>21. <note place="foot" n="30">The Factory Acts.</note>About <date value="1830">1830</date> a systematic effort was made to put
an end to the cruelties that daily went on in a large
number of factories.  A little knot of Leeds
manufacturers, headed by Richard <persName key="Oastler, Richard">Oastler</persName>,
the <soCalled>"Factory King,"</soCalled> a generous, impulsive, and undisciplined enthusiast, and Michael Sadler, a Leeds banker,
of great eloquence and untiring zeal, took up the movement. Early in <date value="1832">1832</date> Sadler brought forward in Parliament
a Ten Hours Bill, limiting the labour of children and
women in factories to ten hours a day. But the Reform
agitation caused the new movement to be forgotten, and
the newly enfranchised middle classes of Leeds refused
to return Sadler, who, like most of the leaders in the
factory agitation, was a strong Tory, to the reformed Parliament. Lord Ashley, afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury, a
young man of high character, good ability, and rigid
Evangelical views, now became the spokesman of the factory
hands in the House of Commons. For fifteen years the
agitation was kept up, though both Whigs and Tories
looked on it with indifference or dislike, shelving the main
questions by inadequate though useful measures such as
Lord Althorp's Factory Act of <date value="1833">1833</date>, and <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName>'s Factory
Act of <date value="1844">1844</date>, which limited <quote>" children's"</quote> (those between nine
and thirteen years of age) labour to six and a half hours,
and <quote>"young persons'"</quote> (between thirteen and eighteen) to
twelve hours a day. But Lord Ashley and his friends redoubled their efforts. Books like <persName key="Carlyle, Thomas">Carlyle</persName>'s Chartism (<date value="1839">1839</date>),
<persName key="Disraeli, Benjamin">Disraeli</persName>'s Sybil (<date value="1845">1845</date>), and Kingsley's Alton Locke (<date value="1850">1850</date>),
showed that the public conscience was aroused, despite the
capitalist prejudices of <persName key="Peel, Robert">Peel</persName>, the hostility of the Political
Economists, who talked of laissez faire and the rights of
property, and the selfish and unscrupulous opposition of
some of the millowners, led by <persName key="Bright, John">John Bright</persName> and by Richard
<persName key="Cobden, Richard">Cobden</persName>. In <date value="1842">1842</date> women and children were altogether
prevented from working in mines, and in <date value="1847">1847</date> John Fielden,
member for Oldham, at last carried the Ten Hours Bill,
though the piecemeal methods of English law-making still
required many supplemental statutes before women and
children were properly protected in the chief industries, and
there is still something to be done in this direction. At last
in <date value="1878">1878</date> Cross's Factories and Workshops Act consolidated
this most important branch of English law. No direct effort


<pb id="p.244" n="244"/>





was made to protect grown men, who were thought able
to see for themselves, but every mill-hand profited by the
wholesome workshops and properly fenced machinery which
were now compulsory.</p>
  <p>22. <note place="foot" n="31">Trades' Unions and Strikes.</note>When the century began iniquitous laws still prohibited the combination of workmen.  In <date value="1824">1824</date> the
Combination Laws were repealed, but next year
fresh Acts imposed new restrictions, and for
many years the Conspiracy Laws were wrested to put down
or punish trade combinations, while six labourers who had
pledged each other to mutual support in their efforts to
better their condition were sentenced to transportation for
administering unlawful oaths. Political Economists argued
that as wages were fixed by <quote>"natural laws"</quote> it was quite
useless for workmen to attempt by combination to raise
their rates of payment, and self-interest and fear combined
to look upon workmen's societies with disfavour. Trades'
Unions, thus under the ban of the law and society, got
many of the worst characteristics of secret associations.
They were often headed by ignorant, violent, and unreasonable men, and the strikes which, under their auspices, became more important movements were sometimes marked
by outrage and brutality, and met by unscrupulous repression, which led to bitter feelings between class and class.
But bit by bit things got better. Despite the coldness of
the law, there was no positive reason to prevent the stronger
trades from forming strong unions, and in <date value="1851">1851</date> the Amalgamated Engineers' Society, established by the consolidation
of all the scattered branches of a great trade into one
union, set a new example of further combination which
was soon extensively followed.  In <date value="1866">1866</date> gross outrages
at Sheffield were brought home to local unionists, and
especially to the Saw-grinders' Union and a ruffian named
Broadhead. This led to a great outcry, but the searching
investigations which followed showed that such misdeeds
were the exceptions and not the rule, and led to a series of
Acts beginning in <date value="1871">1871</date>, which fully protected and recognised legitimate trade societies. By teaching self-help, and
by increasing the workmen's power, and also by acting as
benefit societies on a large scale, they have done much to
raise the condition of the more skilled labourers. In <date value="1872">1872</date>
Joseph Arch established a Union of the poor and dependent agricultural labourers. The extension of Unionism to
the coarse unskilled labour of the towns has had a remarkable exemplification in the successful and orderly strike of


<pb id="p.245" n="245"/>





the London dock labourers in <date value="1889">1889</date>. But as combination
grows more perfect, strikes and locks-out have become
less violent, though unhappily they are still frequent
among many branches of trade.   Moreover, Boards of
Arbitration and Conciliation, such as that started by
Mundella in <date value="1860">1860</date> at Nottingham, and self-acting Sliding-
Scales of wages have, though not without difficulties of
their own, diminished the necessity of recourse to open
warfare.</p>
  <p>23. <note place="foot" n="32">Progress and its limits, <date value="1850">1850</date>-<date value="1887">1887</date>.</note>Constant and beneficent State intervention, the
growth of self-respect and self-help among the workers, and
a better feeling between class and class, have
combined to improve the condition of the mass
of the nation. The change for the better began
perceptibly about <date value="1850">1850</date>.  Workmen are now better fed,
better housed, better clothed, and better paid.  They
work shorter hours and have better means of occupying
their leisure than the brutal drunkenness and degrading
pastimes of a hundred years ago. They are educated
practically at the State expense, and are in some ways
better off than the less organised and heterogeneous but
higher-paid lower middle classes. The future must reside
with those to whom the Constitution gives an almost absolute command of the ballot-box. The least satisfactory side
of modern life is found in the slums of the large towns,
though even here an ever-active philanthropy is at work,
and things are better than they were, if only because the
public conscience is more alive to them.  But there is far
too much dulness, monotony, and lowness of aim among
those comfortably off, and too much abject misery and want
among large sections of the community, to give us any
room to look on nineteenth century progress with undue
or self-complacent satisfaction.</p>
   <p>24. <note place="foot" n="33">Architecture.</note>Neglect of the first principles of art and passion for
 sham and pretence had brought architecture to a low ebb
 in <date value="1800">1800</date>. A somewhat incongruous mimicry of
 Greek architecture was then fashionable for
 public buildings, which is to be seen in many churches built
 after <date value="1820">1820</date>, and at its best in the costly and imposing New
 St. Pancras. But the Romantic and Tractarian attraction
 for the Middle Ages now brought about a Gothic Revival,
 which began in imitation of Perpendicular English Gothic,
 and gradually worked back through the Decorated to the
 Early English and Romanesque styles. The best illustration
 of the earlier steps of this revival are to be seen in the


<pb id="p.246" n="246"/>






new Houses of Parliament built by Sir Charles Barry between <dateRange from="1840" to="1852">1840-52</dateRange>, and in the chapels of the Brothers Pugin, by
far the best trained and most artistic of the leaders of the
Mediaevalists. The best result of this movement was the
careful and loving study of mediaeval monuments both at
home and abroad, especially in Italy and North France,
and the influence of John <persName key="Ruskin, John">Ruskin</persName> was especially powerful
in bringing this about. The practical result was not at first
a very happy one; mock-Gothic buildings of every style
and date sprang up all over England. Later on things got
better, though something was still wanting. The numerous
churches of the fashionable Sir Gilbert Scott often shew
heaviness and want of grace, and always a lack of originality. Street's new Law Courts in the Strand, though composed with more artistic feeling, are ill designed and ill
adapted for their purpose. A higher standard has been
attained in Pearson's Truro Cathedral and Bodley's Memorial Chapel, while the work and influence of such a designer
as Burgess show the capabilities of this school. Unluckily
zeal for uniformity, love of prettiness, and conventional propriety have led to many so-called Restorations of old buildings, which have in too many cases wiped out the historical
record, on the pretence of removing incongruities and differences, and providing modern accommodation. The practical
destruction of many an historical church is the worst result of
the Gothic Revival.</p>
  <p>Later than the taste for Gothic came the study of Renaissance
architecture, and it has been taken up by several men
of ability, as Jackson's New Schools at Oxford may suffice
to show. Hitherto buildings have been erected indiscriminately in all sorts of ways, and nowhere with worse results
than in our houses. But the <quote>"battle of the styles"</quote> must
cease as soon as a wholesome, natural, home-bred school
of architecture arises, and it seems as if in the study of
English domestic architecture of the eighteenth century, by
such men as Norman <persName key="Shaw, Norman">Shaw</persName>, there was a possibility of a real
revival of sound principles and good practical work, which
will make modern houses less hideous and dull than those
which were built by the <quote>"fashionable"</quote> architects of the first
half of the century. The arts of design so intimately bound
up with architecture have found many able exponents in
England, and, as in the great days of Italian art, English
painters and sculptors have devoted much attention to them.
This can be seen in the beautiful art-work of William <persName key="Morris, William">Morris</persName>,
and the complete and healthy change of taste which has


<pb id="p.247" n="247"/>




since <date value="1851">1851</date> been felt in every branch of art-manufacture,
notably furniture, glass, and fabric patterns.</p>
  <p>25. <note place="foot" n="34">Painting</note>In painting the century opened in England with but
small promise of the excellence to come. <persName key="Reynolds, Joshua">Reynolds</persName> and
Gainsborough were succeeded by Sir <persName key="Lawrence, Thomas">Thomas Lawrence</persName>
(<dateRange from="1765" to="1830">1765-1830</dateRange>), whose polished portraits satisfied the taste of
his day. The finer and truer works of Sir Martin Shea, and
the Scottish President Raeburn were however
admired.  But in the noble and splendid
colourist John Constable (<dateRange from="1776" to="1837">1776-1837</dateRange>) England produced a
master the effect of whose work at home and abroad has
been second to none in this century. He had affinities with
the fanciful and delicate Norwich School, of whom the chief
figure was Old Crome (<dateRange from="1768" to="1821">1768-1821</dateRange>). Popularity and high
prices, however, followed rather Sir David Wilkie and the
Scottish School, who, more or less happily inspired by the
Dutch genre painters, attempted domestic subjects with considerable success. But art training was absurdly inadequate,
and the tragic failure of that true critic and draughtsman
Benjamin Haydon (<dateRange from="1786" to="1840">1786-1840</dateRange>), no less than the passing
success of the <quote>"cloysome richness and muddled forms"</quote> of
William Etty (<dateRange from="1787" to="1849">1787-1849</dateRange>), revealed the miserable state of
public taste.</p>
  <p>A new and better era began with the water-colour sketches
of Girtin, and the marvellous romantic landscapes painted
by the gifted and original Joseph Mallord William <persName key="Turner, Joseph M.W.">Turner</persName>
(<dateRange from="1775" to="1851">1775-1851</dateRange>), whose genius was signally proclaimed in <date value="1845">1845</date>
by the eloquence and fancy of John <persName key="Ruskin, John">Ruskin</persName>'s <hi rend="italic">Modern

water-colours, and under his influence there grew up a
remarkable school of British landscape painters in the latter
medium.</p>
  <p>A further step in advance was made when, partly under
the spell of the romantic medieval revival, partly in obedience to a deep hatred of the conventionality and shams of
English figure-painting, a knot of young students, in <date value="1848">1848</date>,
amongst whom <persName key="Brown, Ford Madox">Ford Madox Brown</persName>, <persName key="Rossetti, Dante Gabriel">Dante Gabriel Rossetti</persName>
(<dateRange from="1828" to="1882">1828-82</dateRange>), Holman Hunt, <persName key="Millais, John Everett">John Everett Millais</persName>, and William
Bell <persName key="Scott, William Bell">Scott</persName> were the most prominent, formed the
Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and published in <date value="1849">1849</date> the Germ as
the organ of their endeavours <quote>"to encourage and enforce
an entire adherence to the simplicity of nature."</quote>  From
these men's efforts sprang a lasting improvement in English
art, which was felt far beyond the narrow limits and original
conceptions of the actual brotherhood, and is found in


<pb id="p.248" n="248"/>






modern work inspired by very different ideals.  In <date value="1824">1824</date>
the National Gallery was founded, and in <date value="1838">1838</date> its present
ugly, but convenient, building in Trafalgar Square was
opened.  Art teaching became more real and systematic,
and finally a critic here and there was bold and wise enough
to follow the courses laid down by John <persName key="Ruskin, John">Ruskin</persName>, which
have become the commonplaces of the present generation.
The result was a raised level of technical skill and effort,
and British artists of the present day (though curiously and
unwisely neglecting landscape, in which their predecessors
had surpassed all foreign schools) have at least taken the
trouble to learn their profession.  Of late years the influence of the French Impressionists has been great, and may
be greater.  Nor can one omit to note the effect upon
English artists of the exquisite art of Japan, perhaps the
only country in the world where fine art is now natural,
and enjoyed by the whole people.</p>
  <p>26. <note place="foot" n="35">Sculpture.</note>Nothing could be more pitiful than British sculpture
at the beginning of the century. After the death of John

mannered work of Sir Francis <persName key="Chantrey, Francis">Chantrey</persName> (<date value="1781">1781</date>-<date value="1841">1841</date>) and
the foreign work of John Gibson (<dateRange from="1790" to="1866">1790-1866</dateRange>), a Welshman
who lived in Rome, were its chief representatives. What with lack of opportunity, and poor
training, there has been no sculptor of note among us,
with the singular exception of that ill-treated, but vigorous,
genius Alfred Stevens, till the advent of the truthful and
beautiful work of Gilbert, and other young men, who have
learned the best lessons of modern French sculpture.</p>
  <p>In black and white work the arts of steel-engraving and
mezzo-tint have gone out of fashion, though the recent
revival of etching, neglected since the death of George
Cruikshank (<dateRange from="1792" to="1878">1792-1878</dateRange>), and <quote>"Phiz"</quote> (Hablot K. Browne)
is noteworthy. The woodcuts of Stothard, Harvey, Birket

the art of woodcut illustration, largely carried out by
young artists in periodicals, has attained a decidedly high
level.</p>
  <p>27. In music, the most progressive art in modern times,

the seriousness and high aims of the art, and a greater
taste and appreciation of the great German masters. The
results are widely seen in the almost universal  Music.
introduction of organs and musical services
into parish churches and even Nonconformist chapels,
and of the pianoforte into the home. The diffusion of taste
throughout the land has largely been due to the local
Festivals, which have been often chosen for producing
great works of famous writers, Norwich bringing out Spohr,
and Birmingham Mendelssohn. Choral societies are now
found in every town, and, in Wales and Yorkshire in
almost every village, and have vied with societies in great
centres, like the old Sacred Harmonic Society, in spreading
sound knowledge and taste. Orchestral music has made
great strides, largely furthered by the London Philharmonic Society. Popular concerts of classical music have
become numerous and well attended; and efficient centres
of musical education have been established, such as the
Royal Academy of Music and the recent Royal College of
Music. Prince <persName key="Albert, Prince Consort">Albert</persName> in his day did a great deal for good
music. From about <date value="1830">1830</date> to <date value="1845">1845</date> Spohr was the most
attractive composer. Mendelssohn then became supreme
for a long period, but of late years taste has become more
catholic.</p>
  <p>There has been a great growth of English musical composition.  Early in the century glees and madrigals of a
purely English sort flourished, the leading writers including
Calcott, Attwood, Bishop, and Pearsall.. The old schools
of Church music revived and were developed. Foremost
among church composers and organists were the two
Wesleys, nephew and grandnephew of the founder of
Methodism.   The so-called English Opera of Bishop,
Balfe, and Wallace is at least remembered by its pretty
songs, and has been succeeded by an original species of
extravaganza opera, invented by Gilbert and his colleague
Arthur <persName key="Sullivan, Arthur">Sullivan</persName>.  A severer style of composition dates
from the influence of Sir William Sterndale Bennett (<dateRange from="1816" to="1875">1816-1875</dateRange>),
the founder of the Bach Society. Within the last
fifteen years a flourishing school of writers, headed by
Mackenzie, Parry, and Stanford, has grown up, strongly
influenced by <persName key="Wagner, Richard">Wagner</persName> and Brahms. Italian Opera, after
lingering long as a fashionable amusement, has shown
during recent years signs of a decided revival in England,
while the new musical dramas of <persName key="Wagner, Richard">Wagner</persName> have at last
begun to gain a popular foothold.</p>

  <p>28. <note place="foot" n="36">The Drama and acting. </note>Practical extinction has fallen upon the poetic drama,
while plays, though in less literary shapes, have become the
most popular of amusements. The English school of acting
was at a high pitch at the beginning of the century when the
classic acting of Mrs. Siddons, and the strange poetic genius
of Kean, the greatest actor since <persName key="Garrick, David">Garrick</persName>, possibly since
Burbage, ennobled our stage. The last relics
of these great times lingered in the hearty and
vigorous comedy of Robson, and the pantomimic talent of
Joseph Grimaldi. Our own times have seen the revival of
comedy in new shapes, and the Shaksperian revivals of
Macready, Fechter, Charles Kemble, and Henry Irving.
The influence of the French stage, which has dominated
Europe by the genius of its playwrights and the talent of
its actors, has greatly influenced English acting for good,
though its influence on English dramatic composition has
led to more doubtful results. The melodrama of modern
life, and the comedy of the day, have acquired and held
popular sympathy.  The multiplication of theatres and
music-halls has been a striking feature of the last thirty
years.</p>
  <p>29. <note place="foot" n="37">Amusements.</note>At the same time that indoor amusements have
become more numerous, and, on the whole, more healthy,
there has been an enormous development of outdoor
pastimes. Cricket, popular in a rude form in
the eighteenth century, became more scientific
and more universal in the early years of the present, when
round-hand bowling, at first denounced as unfair, began to
be introduced. Rowing as a pastime dates from the same
period, the first College races at Oxford dating from <date value="1815">1815</date>,
but the racing-boats of the period were clumsy and unwieldy until about <date value="1844">1844</date> the outrigger was perfected by
Henry <persName key="Clasper, Henry">Clasper</persName>, while twenty years later the sliding-seat
added to the oarsman's power. About <date value="1840">1840</date> Athletic Sports
came into vogue. About <date value="1860">1860</date> the old game of Football was
taken up in new forms, and has ever since become increasingly attractive.  With the spread of such healthy and
pure forms of recreation men began bit by bit to turn
with disgust from the brutal, demoralising, and cruel
pastimes of a previous age, such as cock-fighting and bullbaiting.</p>
  <p>30. No aspect of nineteenth century development is more
important than the growth of Natural Science. Englishmen
were among the foremost in finding out those marvellous
laws of nature which have so greatly altered our whole way


<pb id="p.251" n="251"/>





of looking at the universe, and in their applications to the
practical arts have so immensely increased man's command
over matter.  <note place="foot" n="38">Natural Science.</note>The investigations of Joseph
<persName key="Priestley, Joseph">Priestley</persName> (<dateRange from="1733" to="1804">1733-1804</dateRange>), preacher, politician, and
man of science, and Henry <persName key="Cavendish, Henry">Cavendish</persName> <dateRange from="1731" to="1810">(1731-1810</dateRange>) laid the
foundations of modern Chemistry, and the Quaker John
<persName key="Dalton, John">Dalton</persName>'s (<dateRange from="1766" to="1844">1766-1844</dateRange>) Atomic Theory gave workers an hypothesis from which they could advance still further. Sir
Humphry <persName key="Davy, Humphry">Davy</persName> (<dateRange from="1778" to="1829">1778-1829</dateRange>) made a great step in advance
by finding out the metallic basis of the alkalies. In our
own times larger and more fruitful generalisations, and a
more exquisite and minute analysis have again revolutionised the science. The American journalist and politician
Benjamin <persName key="Franklin, Benjamin">Franklin</persName> laid the basis of Electricity long before
he became the strenuous advocate of American freedom.
<persName key="Davy, Humphry">Davy</persName> worked out this science with almost as much success
as chemistry, and found a great successor in Michael Faraday
(<dateRange from="1791" to="1867">1791-1867</dateRange>). Joule's discovery of the mechanical equivalent
of heat was of the utmost importance. In more recent
times the application of Mathematics to Physics by men
like James Clerk Maxwell and William <persName key="Thomson, William">Thomson</persName>, Lord
Kelvin, has led to wonderful advances.  Sir William
Herschel (<dateRange from="1738" to="1822">1738-1822</dateRange>), a Hanoverian musician, who turned
astronomer, discovered in <date value="1781">1781</date> the planet Uranus, and his
son Sir John (<date value="1792">1792</date>-<date value="1871">1871</date>) carried out further at the Cape the
researches begun by his father at Slough. The discovery
of Neptune by Adams, when still a Cambridge undergraduate (<date value="1845">1845</date>), is the greatest triumph of mathematical
Astronomy. The invention of Quaternions by Sir William
Rowan Hamilton, a Dublin professor, marks a new stride
in mathematical science.</p>
  <p>The foundations of the new science of Geology were laid
by the observations of James Hutton (<dateRange from="1726" to="1797">1726-1797</dateRange>) and
William Smith (<dateRange from="1769" to="1840">1769-1840</dateRange>). In a later generation it was
helped forward by the labours of Buckland, Lyell, Sedgwick, and Murchison. Paleontology was ably advanced by
Owen, a great authority on Anatomy, and proved a connection-link with the old science of Natural History, already
developing into the modern science of Biology, when a
revolution in scientific thought was brought about by the
publication in <date value="1859">1859</date> of the Origin of Species by Charles
<persName key="Darwin, Charles">Darwin</persName> (<dateRange from="1809" to="1882">1809-1882</dateRange>). It was the first of a long series of
brilliant and epoch-making books which gradually led to
the general acceptance of Evolution, or the theory of progress by gradual growth, which about the same time was


<pb id="p.252" n="252"/>





simultaneously hit upon by Alfred <persName key="Wallace, Alfred">Wallace</persName>. <persName key="Darwin, Charles">Darwin</persName>'s
theories soon extended into every branch of science the
fruitful method of trying to find out the origin of things by
patient investigation of their history, rather than by startling theories based upon their later and developed aspects.
It is in the Social Sciences as fruitful a method as in
Biology, and the sciences of law and of history have been
metamorphosed by its influence and action. Philology has
been raised by it from the confined limits of elegant
scholarship into a real science of language. More than
any other single principle this Historical Method marks
out the contrast between eighteenth and nineteenth century
thought. In <date value="1831">1831</date> the foundation of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science, with its annual meetings
in various large towns, has served to bring men of science
together, and to make their studies better known.</p>
  <p>31. <note place="foot" n="39">Poetry.</note>Literature has not fallen short in its progress. Early
in the century the new school of poetry was represented by
the Lake School, headed by William <persName key="Wordsworth, William">Wordsworth</persName> (<dateRange from="1770" to="1850">1770-1850</dateRange>), the lofty and sincere singer
of Nature and the natural man, by Samuel Taylor <persName key="Coleridge, Samuel">Coleridge</persName>
(<dateRange from="1772" to="1834">1772-1834</dateRange>), subtlest of poets, most mystic of thinkers, and
most unstable of men. Fear of the French Revolution
woke these writers and their friends, such as the scholarly
Robert Southey (<dateRange from="1774" to="1843">1774-1843</dateRange>), from their fervid dreams of a
coming era of peace and truth into sympathy with old ways,
though men like <persName key="Lamb, Charles">Lamb</persName> and <persName key="Hazlitt, William">Hazlitt</persName> retained, their strong
Liberalism. And soon the very bigotry of the Reaction
drove younger men, and notably George Gordon, Lord
<persName key="Byron, Lord George Gordon">Byron</persName> (<dateRange from="1788" to="1824">1788-1824</dateRange>), the greatest poetical force of his day,
and the most popular and inspiriting of modern poets, into
fierce and eloquent though unmeasured denunciations of
the tyranny of cant, custom, and ignorance. To this day
the poetry of the whole civilised world shows clearly the
effects of <persName key="Byron, Lord George Gordon">Byron</persName>'s writing, spirit, and form of verse. He
has been the herald of Liberalism to the youths of Europe
and America for two generations.  Side by side with
<persName key="Byron, Lord George Gordon">Byron</persName>, as a poet of Revolution, stood Percy Bysshe Shelley
(<dateRange from="1792" to="1822">1792-1822</dateRange>), the most musical, most imaginative, and most
unworldly of modern lyrical poets, who entered far more
deeply than <persName key="Byron, Lord George Gordon">Byron</persName> into sympathy with the moral and
material yearnings of the modern mind. Alongside them
wrote John Keats (<dateRange from="1795" to="1821">1795-1821</dateRange>), cut off before his rare genius
had wholly ripened, in a youth undisturbed by political
tumult, in the single-minded worship of beauty.  His


<pb id="p.253" n="253"/>




career marks the exhaustion of the impulse which began
with Burns and Cowper, and which had now filled all
Britain with singers. Among other notable poetic work of
this period must be reckoned the musical lyrics of Thomas
<persName key="Moore, Thomas">Moore</persName> (<dateRange from="1779" to="1852">1779-1852</dateRange>), the noble songs of <persName key="Campbell, Thomas">Thomas Campbell</persName>
(<dateRange from="1777" to="1844">1777-1844</dateRange>), the robust, vigorous and popular poetic
romances of <persName key="Scott, Walter">Walter Scott</persName>, and the faint Wordsworthian
echoes of John <persName key="Keble, John">Keble</persName>'s pious and refined Christian Year.</p>
  <p>A new poetic wave surges up with the great stir of national
life marked by the Reform Bill, and the Mediaeval Revival
and Tractarian movement. The new writers grapple with
all the problems of life and nature that were disturbing the
minds of the new generation. This movement seems as it
were to culminate in the poems of two men -Alfred
<persName key="Tennyson, Alfred">Tennyson</persName> (<dateRange from="1809" to="1892">1809-1892</dateRange>), whose work, inspired originally by
<persName key="Wordsworth, William">Wordsworth</persName> and Keats, tenderly and beautifully reflects with
Virgilian finish the varied moods of nature; and Robert
<persName key="Browning, Robert">Browning</persName> (<dateRange from="1812" to="1889">1812-1889</dateRange>), the poet-philosopher, the deepest,
roughest, and noblest of our modern singers. To be named
with, but after, them is <persName key="Wordsworth, William">Wordsworth</persName>'s faithful but wayward
disciple <persName key="Arnold, Matthew">Matthew Arnold</persName> (son of Arnold of Rugby), who
also wrote admirable criticism in most lucid and polished
prose, and <persName key="Browning, Elizabeth Barrett">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</persName>, <persName key="Browning, Robert">Robert Browning</persName>'s
gifted wife.</p>
  <p>In strong contrast to these stands the AEsthetic School,
who, like Keats before them, have gone to Greece and
Mediaeval Europe for models and subjects, careless of external aims, and pursuing art for her own sake. Their work,
foreshadowed by Charles Wells and Beddoes, seems to
centre round the exquisite sonnets and pictorial poems of
<persName key="Rossetti, Dante Gabriel">Rossetti</persName>, as consummate a poet as he was unique as a
painter. It has become most widely known by the musical
and eloquent verse of Algernon Charles Swinburne, the
fresh and beautiful narrative verse of William <persName key="Morris, William">Morris</persName>, a
painter and designer of rare excellence, and the pious and
delicate lyrics of <persName key="Rossetti, Christina">Christina Rossetti</persName>, first of English poetesses.</p>
  <p>32. <note place="foot" n="40">Prose.</note>Nor is this nineteenth century less remarkable for
prose than for poetry.  Early in the present era the
Romantic School spread as rapidly and surely
by its prose fiction as by its verse and drama.
Disgusted at the levelling tendency of the French Revolution, crushed by the dull monotony of the middle-class life
of the preceding age, and attracted by the glamour of the
remoter past, the Romanticists found, like the Tractarians
and the Gothic and Pre-Raphaelite revivalists, their fullest


<pb id="p.254" n="254"/>




satisfaction and consolation in the study of the Middle
Ages.  With much that was fantastic, much that was of
permanent good sprang from   the movement.   History
again becomes a serious study, and the labours of the
judicious <persName key="Hallam, Henry">Hallam</persName> prepared the way for the fuller and more
detailed investigations of later times. Thomas Babington
<persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington, Lord">Macaulay</persName> (<dateRange from="1800" to="1859">1800-1859</dateRange>) glorified, with eloquent rhetoric, the
triumphs of Whiggism and of modern material progress, and
became the most popular, vivid, and picturesque of historians, and the best index of the merits and deficiencies
of his time. But the great growth of modern times is the
novel, which in the hands of Sir <persName key="Scott, Walter">Walter Scott</persName> (<dateRange from="1771" to="1832">1771-1832</dateRange>),
an Edinburgh lawyer who aspired to be a Border laird,
became at once the best exposition of the romantic past,
a shrewd and sympathetic analysis of human character and
manners, and the greatest literary influence on modern life.
Among the best prose literature we may enrol the poetic
and impassioned eloquence of Thomas De Quincey (<dateRange from="1785" to="1859">1785-1859</dateRange>);
the austere style and vigorous fancy of Walter
Savage Landor (<dateRange from="1775" to="1864">1775-1864</dateRange>); the exquisite taste and gentle
humour of our greatest critic, Charles <persName key="Lamb, Charles">Lamb</persName> (<dateRange from="1775" to="1834">1775-1834</dateRange>);
the classic simplicity and keen appreciation of William
<persName key="Hazlitt, William">Hazlitt</persName>; the fine, sturdy directness of William <persName key="Cobbett, William">Cobbett</persName>;
and the subtle art and skill of <persName key="Newman, John Henry, Cardinal">John Henry Newman</persName>'s
eloquent pleadings for the theology and system of Modern
Rome.</p>
  <p><note place="foot" n="41">Utilitarians.</note>A school of strong, but narrow, reformers sprang up from
the teaching of Jeremy Bentham (<dateRange from="1748" to="1832">1748-1832</dateRange>), and were
represented in literature by <persName key="Austin, John">John Austin</persName>, the scientific
lawyer, James Mill, the historian of <placeName key="India">India</placeName>, and George
<persName key="Grote, George">Grote</persName>, the banker and historian. They were called Utilitarians, because they applauded or condemned
actions and institutions, according to their usefulness and bearing on the <quote>"greatest good of the greatest
number."</quote> But save in the important departments of law
and constitutional reform, their action was perhaps more
effective in criticising old than in framing new plans, and
their insistence in politics and economics on the doctrine
of laissez faire kept them out of harmony with the deeper
movements of the time. The last teacher of the school,
John Stuart Mill (<dateRange from="1806" to="1873">1806-1873</dateRange>), son of James Mill, found it
hard to square his cold philosophy with his sympathetic and
wide philanthropy, and after his time new influences reigned
over English thought, represented by the Hegelian German
school, expounded by such men as Thomas Hill Green, and


<pb id="p.255" n="255"/>


the fervid advocates of Evolution, headed by <persName key="Herbert, Sidney">Herbert</persName>
Spencer.</p>
  <p><note place="foot" n="42"><persName key="Carlyle, Thomas">Carlyle</persName> and <persName key="Ruskin, John">Ruskin</persName>.</note>Strong reaction from the doctrinaire Utilitarians, bankereconomists, and greed-inspired mill-owners fired the most
influential teacher of the middle part of the century,
Thomas <persName key="Carlyle, Thomas">Carlyle</persName> (<dateRange from="1795" to="1881">1795-1881</dateRange>), who taught reverence, obedience, hero-worship, and the gospel
of duty and work in the strangest, most irregular, and most
irritating of styles, and wielded a mighty influence in turning men away from the coarse materialism of an age of
shams, machinery, and mammon-worship. His friend and
disciple, John <persName key="Ruskin, John">Ruskin</persName>, richest, most eloquent, and most
capricious of writers, made art criticism his vehicle for the
moral and social teaching of his master. Another disciple
of <persName key="Carlyle, Thomas">Carlyle</persName>'s was James Anthony Froude, a great writer, but
a poor historian.</p>
  <p><note place="foot" n="43">History.</note>The scientific study of past history has gained much
from the inspiration of Great German teachers like Niebuhr.
<persName key="Arnold, Thomas">Thomas Arnold</persName>, Bishop Thirlwall, and George <persName key="Grote, George">Grote</persName> wrote
the History of Greece in a new and more
real spirit. The labours of Lingard, Kemble,
<persName key="Hallam, Henry">Hallam</persName>, and Palgrave, and the advance of historical work
in France and Germany, have stimulated the growth of an
English Historical School of which Stubbs, Freeman, and
Gardiner are the conspicuous members, while Sir William
Napier (brother of the conqueror of Sind) and Kinglake
wrote admirable narratives of contemporary events, and
John Richard Green popularised the history of the English
people.</p>
  <p><note place="foot" n="44">Novels.</note>Novel-writing continued to be the most popular form of
literature; the historical novel, founded by <persName key="Scott, Walter">Scott</persName> and followed
by Hugo and Dumas in France, and less able
writers here and in America, was long in vogue,
but the novel of contemporary life, in its many varieties,
secured the adherence of most writers and readers. The
admirable sketches of Miss Edgeworth, Carleton, and Galt
were succeeded by the work of the greatest of English
novelists, William Makepeace <persName key="Thackeray, William Makepeace">Thackeray</persName> (<dateRange from="1811" to="1863">1811-1863</dateRange>), who
analysed and satirised the society of his day; by Charles
<persName key="Dickens, Charles">Dickens</persName> (<dateRange from="1812" to="1870">1812-1870</dateRange>), the most popular of all writers of
fiction, who dwelt with laughable exaggeration on the foibles
and humours of London life, and strove to promote reforms by lurid pictures of some evils of society. Among
prominent works of fiction may be included the sea stories
of Captain Marryat, which have delighted three generations


<pb id="p.256" n="256"/>



of English boys; the powerful and passionate fiction of the
three Bronte sisters, <persName key="Bronte, Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, <persName key="Bronte, Emily">Emily</persName>, and <persName key="Bronte, Anne">Anne</persName>;
the powerful wayward tales of George Borrow; the faithful photography of dull English middle-class life by Anthony Trollope;
the vigorous and purposeful stories of Charles Kingsley,
Charles Reade, and Mrs. Gaskell; the clever and amusing caricatures and romances of Charles Lever; the admirable
pictures of country and country-town society, which, with
too great an admixture of didactic reflection, mark the work
of Marian Evans (<dateRange from="1819" to="1880">1819-1880</dateRange>), who wrote as George Eliot;
the showy and popular but hollow and unreal novels of Lord
Lytton, and the fantastic novels of <persName key="Disraeli, Benjamin">Disraeli</persName>, some of which,
despite their exaggeration and affectation, will survive on
account of the shrewdness of their political aim, and the
light they throw on the character of their writer. Foremost
among recent writers stands the great work of the poet
George Meredith, whose brilliant, thoughtful, and thoroughly
artistic novels, though they may never become widely popular,
will never lack admirers and readers.</p>
  <p>33. <note place="foot" n="45">Magazines and Newspapers.</note>The growth of periodicals and of the newspaper press
is the sign of a large class of people fond of reading, but not
able or willing to read deeply. In <date value="1802">1802</date> a group
of young men of letters living at Edinburgh, then
an intellectual centre hardly second to London, founded the
Whig Edinburgh Review, to which <persName key="Macaulay, Thomas Babington, Lord">Macaulay</persName> contributed his
famous Essays. In <date value="1818">1818</date> the Tories started the opposition
Quarterly Review. Blackwood's Magazine was founded in
<date value="1817">1817</date>, the organ of the poet-professor <persName key="Wilson, John">John Wilson</persName>, and
<persName key="Scott, Walter">Scott</persName>'s son-in-law and biographer John Lockhart; and the
equally brilliant Fraser's Magazine (<dateRange from="1830" to="1882">1830-1882</dateRange>), with its
wonderful body of contributors, came a few years later with
many other monthlies. In London the Times newspaper,
started in <date value="1788">1788</date>, and edited between <dateRange from="1815" to="1877">1815 and 1877</dateRange> by
Barnes and Delane, having exposed a series of commercial
frauds, gained a wonderful influence and shrewd power of
forecasting opinion. The first daily paper in Scotland was
started in <date value="1847">1847</date>. The reduction of the newspaper stamp to
a penny in <date value="1836">1836</date>, and its abolition altogether in <date value="1855">1855</date>, caused
a great growth of the provincial press, daily papers now
cropping up in all the large towns, and rivalling the London
ones.  The Scotsman, the <placeName key="Manchester">Manchester</placeName> Guardian (twice
a week), the Leeds and <placeName key="Liverpool">Liverpool</placeName> Mercuries, and the
Northern Star (once the Chartist organ), previously leading local weeklies, soon became daily papers.  A new
departure began with the London Daily News in <date value="1846">1846</date>,


<pb id="p.257" n="257"/>





edited for a time by <persName key="Dickens, Charles">Charles Dickens</persName>, the first cheap daily
paper, which in <date value="1868">1868</date> was first sold for a penny.  The
cheapening process went on until few papers cost more
than a penny, and many a halfpenny. Charles Knight's
excellent Penny Magazine (<dateRange from="1832" to="1846">1832-1846</dateRange>), published for the
Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, Chambers's
Edinburgh Journal, and the Dublin Magazine were the
first cheap magazines. In <date value="1850">1850</date> <persName key="Dickens, Charles">Dickens</persName>'s Household Words
was published every week. In <date value="1865">1865</date> George Henry Lewes,
a writer on philosophical and scientific subjects, started the
Fortnightly Review for the free discussion of serious subjects
by known writers, and his example has been followed by a
number of imitators. A crowd of cheap magazines, mostly
consisting of tales and light articles, now floods the literary
market. Of late years there has been an immense increase
in the number of papers devoted to special branches of
science and sport, several of which are of much excellence.</p>
  <p>34. <note place="foot" n="46">Elementary Education.</note>The circle of educated or partly educated readers, for
all that is now written, has been immensely widened by the
diffusion of education.  Early in the century
most of the old grammar and charity schools
had sunk very low, and few children of the English, and none
of the Irish, lower classes had any education, though in
Scotland a plan projected by John Knox and the Reformers
had been a reality since <date value="1696">1696</date>, and every parish had had its
school for over a century. A new departure was made with
the efforts of Bell and Lancaster, and the National Society
started in <date value="1811">1811</date>, on Church principles, to rival the <quote>"undenominational"</quote> British and Foreign School Society begun
in <date value="1804">1804</date>. But at first their operations were on a small scale,
though a new period begins in <date value="1833">1833</date>, when public money
was first granted for elementary education.  In <date value="1839">1839</date> the
rudiments of an Education Department appear, and the
earnest efforts of Dr. Kay, afterwards Sir James KayShuttleworth, the secretary to the Committee of Council on
Education, gradually built up the best system circumstances
allowed. But religious animosities long stopped the way
of further progress.  In <date value="1839">1839</date> the bishops prevented the
establishment of a Government Training School, so that
the whole work was thrown on the two societies. In <date value="1843">1843</date>

education.  Nevertheless, the number of children in
National and British schools continued to grow, and the
State grants mounted up in <date value="1861">1861</date> to three-quarters of a
million a year.  In <date value="1861">1861</date> Robert <persName key="Lowe, Robert">Lowe</persName>, then Vice-President of the Education Committee, brought in the new code

the labours of the voluntary educators by establishing schoolboards, compulsion, and a really national system.  The
result was that the million children receiving elementary
education in <date value="1870">1870</date> was raised by <date value="1885">1885</date> to over three millions.
In Ireland the system adopted has been different, and progress much slower.</p>

reformed seven of the greatest historical English Schools.
In <date value="1869">1869</date> the Endowed Schools Act began the reform of the

  <p><note place="foot" n="48">The Universities.</note>The Universities were casting off the slumber of the
eighteenth century. The Tractarian and Liberal movements after <date value="1830">1830</date> made Oxford full of real intellectual life, and, more gradually, Cambridge,
never sunk so low as Oxford, became a centre of zealous
study. But the corruptions of generations could only be
cleared away by force, and the large changes thought
needful to bring the ancient seats of learning abreast of
modern times were sought for from external sources. In
<date value="1854">1854</date> Oxford and Cambridge were reformed by Royal Commissions. The monopoly of power of the heads of houses,
the clerical, local, and celibate restrictions in the Colleges,
the dependence of the University on the Colleges composing it, were assailed, while the Universities themselves
had already begun to bring in new studies, like History and
Natural Science. A new spirit now came over Oxford and
Cambridge, which for good and evil has since endured, and
was strengthened by the abolition of religious tests in <date value="1871">1871</date>,




<pb id="p.259" n="259"/>




and the second Commission of <date value="1877">1877</date>, though the outside reformers worked without method or policy, and in some ways
did distinct harm. Competition has awakened the slumber
of students, but has often led them aside from the real ends
of all study.</p>
  <p>In <persName key="George IV.">George IV.</persName>'s reign the London University was started
by <persName key="Brougham, Henry">Brougham</persName> and <persName key="Grote, George">Grote</persName>, to open out higher education to
non-Churchmen, while the Church started King's College in
opposition. A Charter to confer degrees was given to both
in <date value="1835">1835</date>, but unluckily the London University, as the degreegiving body was called, afterwards became a mere place for
examining all comers, though <persName key="Brougham, Henry">Brougham</persName>'s foundation continued to flourish as University College. The four Scotch
Universities, poor and unorganised, but full of rough and
vigorous intellectual life, and often taught by men of the
greatest eminence, though for the mass of their students
rather higher popular schools than seats of the highest culture, were very partially reformed in <date value="1858">1858</date>. In Ireland religious and political difficulties have retarded the progress
of higher education. Dublin, despite the abolition of religious tests, retains largely the Protestant character. A retrograde step was taken in <date value="1880">1880</date>, when the Queen's University
was superseded by the Royal University, a simple examining
body. In recent days local colleges, now fast winning State
support, nave been started in most of the larger towns, and
have done a useful work in popularising higher culture, and
in some cases have become great centres of serious study
and research, notably in the newer branches of education,
such as natural science. Owens College, <placeName key="Manchester">Manchester</placeName>, the
oldest, wealthiest, and largest of these, has been united
with its neighbours, University College, <placeName key="Liverpool">Liverpool</placeName>, and the
Yorkshire College, Leeds, to form the new Victoria University. In <date value="1893">1893</date> the three university colleges set up by the

<p>THE history of the English race has long ceased to be
simply the history of a small corner of North-Western
Europe. For the last two centuries a constant Expansion
of England has been going on which is from many points
of view the most striking fact of our recent history.</p>
  <p>In the seventeenth century England was only one of
several European colonising and trading powers.  The
Revolution of <date value="1688">1688</date> saw her already striving for the first
place. Portugal and Holland, the first countries of modern
Europe to found trading Empires, now became her dependants. The wars of the eighteenth century effectually
got rid of the more formidable rivalry of France and
Spain.</p>
  <p>The English triumph brought about two great results.
It led to the establishment of a vast dependency in <placeName key="India">India</placeName>.
It resulted in the settlement of a great series of English
colonies all over the world.</p>
  <p>The loss of America, though it split for ever the British
race in twain, hardly seemed to check this development.
During the very years in which America was winning her
independence, Warren <persName key="Hastings, Warren">Hastings</persName> was building up the
British Empire in <placeName key="India">India</placeName>. A New Colonial Empire, won
by force from less successful foreign colonists, or settled in
wildernesses hitherto untrodden by civilised man, now
grew up with wonderful rapidity.</p>
  <p>We have now to see how during the period between the
early years of <persName key="George III.">George III.</persName> and the present day British
<placeName key="India">India</placeName> and the New Colonial Empire came into being.</p>

  <p>1. <note place="foot" n="1"><placeName key="India">India</placeName> and its peoples.</note>The vast peninsula called by the westerns <placeName key="India">India</placeName> is as
big as all Europe west of Russia, and includes as many
differences of race, tongue, manners, civilisation, climate, and productions as Europe itself.
Geographically it is divided into the Mountain district of
the Himalayas, which cuts it off from Asia proper by a
double wall of snow, the great plain of the North, or
Hindostan, watered by the Ganges and Indus, and, south
of the Vindhya Mountains, the southern table-land of the
Deccan peninsula. <note place="foot" n="2">The Non-Aryans.</note>The oldest historical inhabitants were
flat-nosed savages, whose descendants still
remain in the wild hill tribes, some still in their
ancient barbarism, but others settled down to peaceful life,
and showing trustworthiness and bravery as soldiers. <note place="foot" n="3">The Aryans.</note>Long
before recorded history begins, North-west <placeName key="India">India</placeName> was
invaded by a small body of fair-skinned Aryans, with
both a vernacular and a sacred tongue (Sanskrit) akin to those of Europe, and enjoying
a primitive civilisation of the same origin as our own.<note place="foot" n="4">The Hindu race.</note>
They enslaved many of their forerunners, and drove the
rest into the hills and into the south, and, gradually
civilising and blending with their dependants,
there grew up the mixed but Aryan-speaking
Hindu races of Northern and Western <placeName key="India">India</placeName>. The stationary civilisation which grew up in Aryan Hindostan
was due to the growth of a rigid caste system, at once the
social and religious basis of life, which built up impassable
walls between the <quote>"twice born"</quote> high castes, proud of their
less tainted Aryan blood, and headed by the noble Brahmans, and the <quote>"once born"</quote> low castes, who in feature,
manners, and faith show the blood of the primitive
non-Aryan folk. The Hindu mind soon practically abandoned
the aristocratic worship of the Aryan gods of the Vedas for
the worship of Vishnu the Preserver, and even Siva the
Foul Destroyer, and for the local adoration of the formless
gods of clay and rough-hewn stones that are venerated
by the simple husbandmen. In the south the Dravidian
non-Aryan tongues prevail, such as Tamil, Telugu, and
Kanarese, and even the northern dialects like Hindi and
Marathi show many traces of a non-Aryan commixture.

<note place="top" n="1">[<dateRange from="1526" to="1761">1526-1761</dateRange>.]</note>

But the variety of the conditions and the vastness of Indian
distances bring out very wide differences in the Hindu
stock. The fierce warlike clans preyed upon the easy-going
peace-loving husbandmen organised into self-governing
tribal village communities.</p>
  <p>2. <note place="foot" n="5">The Mohammedan rule.</note>The history of <placeName key="India">India</placeName>, helpless in its mild population
and tempting with its fancied wealth, is a long series of
foreign invasions, beginning with the Greeks
under Alexander and his successors. Early in
the eleventh century the all-conquering Mohammedans
of Central Asia first crossed the mighty mountain wall and
carved out kingdoms for themselves in the rich plains
beyond. Besides bringing in an exclusive caste of ruling
foreigners, who with their Persian speech and semi-Turkish semi-Arab civilisation were cut off very sharply from
their subjects, they forced a large minority of the northwestern states and a majority of the lower Bengalis to turn
to the faith of Islam.  <note place="foot" n="6">The Mogul Empire, <dateRange from="1526" to="1707">1526-1707</dateRange>.</note>A long series of conquests from
Mahmud of Ghazni and Timur culminated in the invasion
of Babar (the Lion) in <date value="1526">1526</date>, the founder of
the Mogul (Mughal) Empire, which under his
grandson Akbar the Great (<dateRange from="1556" to="1605">1556-1605</dateRange>) became
a mighty power ruling the vast plains of the north through
a careful civil and military organisation, and raising a
greater revenue from them than has ever since been drawn
from the same districts. Under Jahangir (<dateRange from="1605" to="1627">1605-1627</dateRange>) and
Shah Jahan (<dateRange from="1628" to="1658">1628-1658</dateRange>) the Empire continued to flourish,
and extended its conquests to the Deccan.  Aurangzeb
(<dateRange from="1658" to="1707">1658-1707</dateRange>) was the last great Mogul Emperor.    But
he wasted his strength in the vain effort to consolidate
his rule in the south, and after his death the Empire fell
asunder.</p>
  <p>3. <note place="foot" n="7">The Marathas, <dateRange from="1674" to="1761">1674-1761</dateRange>.</note>A great Hindu revival had begun with the career of
Sivaji, the leader of the warlike Marathas (<date value="1674">1674</date>), whose
descendants soon fell into sloth and impotence
as Rajas of Satara, leaving the real lordship of
the people to the Peshwa, or hereditary prime minister,
who ruled at Poona, over nearly all Southern <placeName key="India">India</placeName>,
and extended his ravages as far north as the Punjab.
But the hardy Afghans came to the help of the Mohammedans of <placeName key="India">India</placeName>, and internal dissensions broke up the
unity of the Maratha power, though even in their decay
they remained the greatest military influence in Central
<placeName key="India">India</placeName>. The high Brahman Peshwa sank to be the local
lord of Poona, and the titular head of a so called


<pb id="p.263" n="263"/>



<quote>"confederacy,"</quote> of five Maratha houses, whose other chieftains
were of humble stock like the low-caste warriors
who made up the real strength of the Marathas.<note place="foot" n="8">The five Maratha states.</note>
  In the north lines of chiefs named Sindhia and Holkar,
  sprung respectively from a slipper-bearer and a shepherd,
  ruled over fertile Malwa at Gwalior and Indore.  The
  Bhonslas of Nagpur bore sway over Berar and Central
  <placeName key="India">India</placeName>, and by their conquest of Orissa threatened Bengal.
  The Gaekwars of Baroda governed a rich though scattered
  territory in Gujarat and Kathiawar.  Bit by bit the
  Marathas ceased to be freebooters and became rulers and
  conquerors.</p>
  <p>4. <note place="foot" n="9"><placeName key="India">India</placeName> on the eve of the British Conquest.</note>The degenerate lords of Delhi, after losing Afghan
  assistance became in turns dependent on the English and
  the Marathas. The Viceroys of the Moguls had
  now become for all real purposes sovereign
  chiefs.  Beyond the Vindhyas the Nizam-ul-Mulkh
  (Regulator of the State), whose capital was Haidarabad,
  was nominally Subadhar or Viceroy of the Mogul
  Emperors in all Southern <placeName key="India">India</placeName>, but his power was circumscribed by the Bhonsla on the north, and the Hindu Rajas of
  Mysore, Trichinopoli, and a swarm of petty hill chieftains
  on the south. Even his own vassal, the Nawab of Arcot,
  lord of the Karnatik, acted quite independently of him.
  In the north the Nawabs were equally free to do what
  they would, but power easily dropped from their nerveless hands to any strong adventurer. It was thus that the
  Arcot and Bengal succession questions became, as we have
  seen, the occasions for the fierce rivalry of French and
  English, and the triumph of <persName key="Clive, Robert">Clive</persName> over Dupleix, which made
  the English Company the virtual ruler of Bengal. Higher
  up the Ganges ruled the Mohammedan Wazirs of Oudh. In
  the extreme north the Punjab became the possession of the
  Sikhs, a martial sect of reforming Hindu Puritans, who
  taught the unity of God and the duty of living a pure life,
  and rejected caste altogether.  To their south the high-
  caste chieftains of Rajputana had been the first to lead
  the Hindu revolt against the Moguls.</p>
  	<p>The death of Aurangzeb began the confusion, which
  culminated in <date value="1761">1761</date>, when the defeat of the Marathas at
  Panipat by the Afghans, leagued with their Moslem
  brethren of <placeName key="India">India</placeName>, prevented the further growth of the
  Maratha power, though it was powerless to restore the
  tottering Mogul Empire.  Everywhere were anarchy and
  confusion, warfare and brigandage. Population fell off, till

there were hardly men enough left to till the fields. Such
was the state of things which made possible a European
conquest of <placeName key="India">India</placeName>. The triumph of <persName key="Clive, Robert">Clive</persName> over Dupleix
had already settled that England, not France, should win
the prize.</p>
  <p>5. <note place="foot" n="10">The English supremacy.</note>Plassey and Wandewash gave the East <placeName key="India">India</placeName> Company a supremacy over Bengal and the Karnatik, but in
 no way enlarged their territorial possessions.
  For nearly forty more years the Governor of
Madras ruled over little beyond the town and factories.
The Governor of <placeName key="Bombay">Bombay</placeName> had not even an ascendency until
the end of the century. Even in Bengal the only legal change
was the grant by Mir Jafar of the zamindari or right of
collecting the rents of the cultivators in the Twenty-four
Parganas (the district round Calcutta), and where they were
after <date value="1759">1759</date> the feudal subjects of <persName key="Clive, Robert">Clive</persName> himself, who received
from the Emperor the jagir or military fief of the same
district, an arrangement only ended after <persName key="Clive, Robert">Clive</persName>'s death.</p>
  <p><note place="foot" n="11">The period of anarchy, <dateRange from="1760" to="1765">1760-1765</dateRange>.</note>From <date value="1758">1758</date> to <date value="1760">1760</date> <persName key="Clive, Robert">Clive</persName>'s presence as Governor of the
Calcutta factory ensured the keeping up of the English
supremacy, but from <date value="1760">1760</date> to <date value="1765">1765</date> he was away
in England.  During this period the greedy
officials sought only to turn the Company's
position into a means of heaping up ill-gotten fortunes
from the helpless Bengalis, and managed so badly that
they drove the new Nawb Mir Kasim, son-in-law of Mir
Jafar, to break with the Company. Mir Kasim now went
to war, massacred 200 English at Patna, and formed an
alliance with the Nawab Wazir of Oudh and Shah Alam,
the new Emperor. But the English were still the stronger.
In <date value="1764">1764</date> the Nawab was badly beaten at the decisive
battle of Baxar, which laid not only Bengal, but Oudh and
the Emperor himself, at the feet of the Company.</p>
  <p>6. <note place="foot" n="12">The Dual System, <dateRange from="1765" to="1772">1765-1772</dateRange>.</note>In <date value="1765">1765</date> <persName key="Clive, Robert">Clive</persName> (now a peer) came back as Governor,
and by giving the districts of Allahabad and Kora, which
made up most of the Doab (the region between
the Jumna and the Ganges), back to the Emperor, and restoring the Nawab Wazir to
Oudh, he got ShAh Alam to grant the Company the Diwani
or fiscal administration of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, though
the Nizamat or criminal jurisdiction still remained with the
puppet Nawab at Murshidabad. <persName key="Clive, Robert">Clive</persName>'s other great work
was to stop the monstrous corruption which had resulted
from every servant of the Company engaging in private
trade and receiving presents from the natives. He compensated



<pb id="p.265" n="265"/>




the unwilling and mutinous civilians and officers
by a large increase to their hitherto scanty pay. Thus he
laid the foundations both of our territorial Empire and
of our system of administration. But his Dual System of
government, by which the Company and the Nawab were
still joint rulers, and corrupt native underlings still collected
the revenue from the suffering and patient cultivators, soon
proved a complete failure. Yet it bridged over the transition from a state of affairs very similar to our present
position in Egypt, to a time when Bengal became in name
as well as in deed a possession of the Company. Anyhow
it was a great improvement on the mere anarchy and
robbery of the times between <dateRange from="1757" to="1765">1757 and 1765</dateRange>, and the
violent attacks which embittered the closing years of <persName key="Clive, Robert">Clive</persName>'s
life were inspired by the jobbers and robbers that he had
curbed in their evil deeds.</p>

suffered terribly from nervous depression and from weak
health. He was simple and soldierly in his manner, and
won enormous influence over the natives, though he never

to build up a mighty fortune for himself, but his whole
influence made for efficiency, justice, and sound government. He was the founder of our Indian Empire.</p>
  <p>7. The Dual System lasted from <date value="1765">1765</date> to <date value="1772">1772</date>. In <date value="1770">1770</date>
a terrible famine cut off a third of the population of Bengal,

appointing European collectors to every district,
establishing courts of justice and a police system,
created the administrative system which has become one
of the great glories of the British rule, and turned an Eastern
despotism, exercised by Western merchants, into a stable,
settled, and enlightened government. But he had to make
Bengal pay, and found that his easiest way of getting
money was by a brilliant foreign policy. He wisely cut
down the enormous allowances of the Nawab, when he
transferred the real government from Murshidabad to Calcutta.  <note place="foot" n="16">Oudh.</note>Seeing that Shah Alam had now become a tool
of the Marathas, he broke <persName key="Clive, Robert">Clive</persName>'s settlement of Allahabad
and Kora to the Emperor, and for a vast sum allowed it to

British troops to put down in the ruthless

Three great events mark his tenure of office,
which completed and consummated the home
and foreign policy of <persName key="Hastings, Warren">Hastings</persName>. They were the Permanent
Settlement of Bengal, the reform of the Company's administration. and the second Mysore War.</p>
   <quote rend="blockquote"><note place="foot" n="30">The Permanent Settlement of Bengal, <date value="1793">1793</date>.</note>From time beyond memory the soil of Bengal had been tilled and
the land held by self-governing village communities, each under its
head-man, who paid a heavy land-tax or rent to the State, which
was in a way the final owner of the soil. The Mogul Emperors had
intrusted the collection of the land-tax to a class called Zamindars,
who were often old local chiefs, and whose office tended to become
permanent and hereditary.  The English now established a settlement
of the lands of Bengal, Behar, and English Orissa
(the rest belonged to Bhonsla), by which the Zamindar
tax farmers were practically given the proprietorship
of the lands they were responsible for, at a fixed
rate of payment, which was now declared perpetual.
 It has been said that <persName key="Cornwallis, Charles">Cornwallis</persName> wished to set up a class of squires
 in Bengal; but, though the English system of private and individual
 ownership of land in large masses may have led him to disregard
 the less obtrusive rights of the peasant groups, holding the land in
 common as some of our Teutonic ancestors did before they came
 to Britain, yet the real motive which inspired him was the desire
 to get a fixed and certain revenue, and the notion that the wealthy
 Zamindars were easier to get hold of, and more likely to keep a con tract than the ignorant and numerous peasantry. But the Zamindars
 soon began to rack rent their new dependants, whose long standing
 customary rights only received a tardy and partial recognition in <date value="1859">1859</date>
 and <date value="1885">1885</date>.  Far better was the rayatwari settlement of most of
 Madras when, early in the nineteenth century, the lands of the
 Nawabs of the Karnatik were annexed to the British dominions.
 This made the rayat, or peasant-cultivator, the proprietor of the soil,
 and not a grasping middle-man.   But alike in north and south
 the old communal land tenure was changed into individual ownership
 after the English fashion. In <placeName key="Bombay">Bombay</placeName> a similar but simpler settlement
 was made to that of Madras. But the southern peasant often fell
 hopelessly into the hands of the village usurer, from whom he has
 been to some extent protected by recent legislation.</quote>

manner, intelligent, brave, unscrupulous, and self-disciplined.
His friendship was worth winning, but better terms turned
him from the English to the Russian alliance. Auckland

Kandahar, stormed Ghazni, and finally took Kabul. Shah Shuja was
restored, and Dost Mohammed surrendered in despair.
But even the continuance of a strong army at Kabul
could not secure the throne of the new ruler, and events
soon showed the folly of Auckland's opinion that his
restoration was pleasing to the Afghans.  The tribes that held the
passes between Kabul and the Sikh frontier cut off all communication
between the garrison and <placeName key="India">India</placeName>. Kabul itself rose in revolt, and
Akbar Khan, Dost Mohammed's son, headed a general Afghan insurrection. The English leader, General Elphinstone, a kindly, popular
old man, unable to walk from gout, and hardly able to ride, had
neither energy nor spirit for his desperate work, and before long he
accepted the promise of the Afghans to allow his retreat in safety.
His panicstricken and disorganised army started from their illdefended cantonments on a difficult and dangerous journey through
the defiles of the Khurd-Kabul and the Khaibar Pass to Peshawar.
But Akbar would not, or more probably could not, keep his promise,
and the fierce mountaineers, lining every height, shot down the unresisting fugitives as they dragged on in helpless disorder, suffering intensely
from the icy cold and deep snows of the hard Afghan winter. As
they grew weaker the hillmen laid aside their matchlocks and butchered
the fugitives by the score with their long deadly knives. The women
and children and the leaders surrendered themselves as hostages to
Akbar Khan, who treated them kindly. But the ceaseless work of
destruction went on against the followers and rank and file. On the
morning of 13th January <date value="1842">1842</date> a sentry from the walls of Jalalabad
saw a single white man clinging wearily to the neck of a wretched
tired-out pony that could hardly drag him along. It was Brydon, the
sole survivor of the army of 4500 men with its 12,000 followers that
had marched out of Kabul a week before.</quote>

Cawnpur garrison had surrendered. The men were treacherously shot
down, as they were carried in boats down the Ganges, by Tantia Topi,
the Nana's only able subordinate. The women and children were
butchered in cold blood when the Nana heard of Havelock's advance.
Two days later Havelock occupied Cawnpur, but it was not till 25th
September that he was able to relieve Lucknow, where for nearly three

The death of Dost Mohammed was followed by sanguinary

in <date value="1869">1869</date> held an interview with Lord Mayo, who

win the succession for his favourite son, preferring, on
Lawrence's principles, to leave Afghanistan to itself. Northbrook carried out the same policy, but a new school of
Indian Governors had now grown up represented by Sir
Bartle Frere and Sir Henry Rawlinson, who persuaded the
<persName key="Disraeli, Benjamin">Disraeli</persName> Government that it was of the utmost importance
that English residents should be maintained in the chief
Afghan cities as the best means of counteracting the
intrigues of Russia, now slowly but surely conquering the
brigand states of Turkestan, and, like England, of necessity
embarked on a career of Asiatic conquest. <note place="foot" n="69">Lord Lytton, <dateRange from="1876" to="1880">1876-80</dateRange>.  </note>On

  <quote rend="blockquote"><note place="foot" n="70">Afghan War, <dateRange from="1878" to="1880">1878-80</dateRange>.</note>Shir Ali suspected Lytton's offers of a temporary mission, and
complaining that he had been wronged by the English, received a
Russian embassy at Kabul, a step which gave some justification to the
Viceroy's reiterated demands. The Amir's determined refusal brought
about war, and <persName key="Disraeli, Benjamin">Disraeli</persName> boasted that its object was a <quote>"scientific
frontier,"</quote> that is the Bolan, the Kuram and the Khaiber, passes, rather
than the valley of the Indus. In <date value="1878">1878</date> three armies overran Afghanistan, Shir All fled to die in Turkestan, and his
son Yakub Khan signed the Treaty of Gandamak, which advanced the
English frontier to the further sides of the passes, and allowed an
English resident at Kabul (<date value="1879">1879</date>), receiving in return an English subsidy.
But by surrendering to the English, Yakub Khan lost all hold of his subjects, who were above all things zealous for their independence. Within
a few months a fanatical mob attacked the Residency, and murdered
the envoy Sir Louis Cavagnari. General <persName key="Roberts, F.">Roberts</persName> at once led a second
invasion into Afghanistan, and in October occupied Kabul and
deposed the Amir. But the Afghan chiefs held out at Ghazni, and
Abdurrahman, a nephew and old rival of Shir All, now came upon the
scene from his refuge in Central Asia, where he had learnt to value
Russian support. A period of confusion and disorder set in. Rival
chieftains fought for the Afghan throne, though all willingly combined
against the English. In <date value="1880">1880</date> it was resolved to abandon Afghanistan,
and a new treaty was made with Abdurrahman which quietly dropped



<pb id="p.285" n="285"/>



the offensive clauses of the treaty of Gandamak. But Abdurrahman's
rival Ayub Khan, lord of Herat, and brother of the deposed Yakub,
defeated General Burrows at Maiwand, near Kandahar. Before Afghanistan could be abandoned this disaster had to be avenged. <persName key="Roberts, F.">Roberts</persName>'s
great march from Kabul to Kandahar led to the temporary defeat of
Ayub. The English troops then withdrew.  Afghanistan was now
the prey of civil war between Ayub and Abdurrahman, but, after a hot
struggle, Abdurrahman drove out his rival, and has since reigned as
undisputed Amir. The only chance of a united Afghanistan, strong
enough to prove an efficient barrier to Russia, would have been
destroyed had the policy of interference been persisted in. But the
hesitation in England between the two policies and their alternate
prevalence was ominous as to the result of the growing influence of
English party struggles in <placeName key="India">India</placeName>.</quote>

together with some smaller irregular districts, under Commissioners.  In <date value="1881">1881</date> these regions were inhabited by
200,000,000 inhabitants, while 56,000,000 more dwell in the

rapidity, now that the old checks of war, pestilence, famine,
widow-seclusion, and child-murder are all but done away
with.  Manufactures, however, are springing up to take
away some of the surplus population from the soil, and in

  <p>1. <note place="foot" n="1">Contrast between <date value="1763">1763</date> and <date value="1783">1783</date>. Fall of the old Colonial Empire. </note>The old Colonial Empire of England reached its
greatest prosperity with the Peace of Paris in <date value="1763">1763</date>.
England was now supreme over North America, and had
won so many West Indian islands that the
French possessions sank into insignificance.
In South America its dependency Portugal
ruled over the Brazils. In the East the French
had been driven out and the Dutch traded on sufferance.
In East and West alike the Spaniards trembled lest they
should be overthrown by the pushing heretics from the
North. But few Englishmen, and no English statesman
save Chatham, realised the new responsibilities that the
increased growth and prosperity of the Colonies brought
upon the mother-country.  Though the Colonies were
as free as they could be politically, the old notion that
colonies existed only for the good of England, as farms to
be worked for its benefit, found an expression in the trading system which checked the development of the young
communities. Their increasing wealth and strength only led
to a desire to interfere still more, since so much more
was now to be got from interference. Thus the Home
Government grew stricter, while the Colonies became
resentful, angry, hostile.  England's old rivals eagerly
profited by the discord between Old and New England.
The result was the American War, the Independence of
the Thirteen Colonies, the splitting of the British race
in twain, and the surrender of some of <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName>'s new conquests by the disastrous Treaty of Versailles.  Never
was there a greater contrast than between <date value="1763">1763</date> and <date value="1783">1783</date>.
The old colonies fell away; and the system of monopoly
and protection on which the old Empire was based received its deathblow.  The old channels of trade were
rudely diverted, and the old ideas of colonial government
roughly overthrown. The Whig reformers even got rid of
the Colonial Secretaryship as a useless and superfluous
office.</p>

North America the former French colonies of Canada,
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Cape Breton,
and Prince Edward's Island, and the valuable
fishing - stations of bleak, barren Newfoundland still clave to English rule. <note place="foot" n="2">The English Colonies after <date value="1783">1783</date>.</note>A large immigration of
faithful and persecuted loyalists from the United States
replaced the outcast Acadians in Nova Scotia,
and began   to form  a thoroughly English
Upper Canada on the northern shores of Lake
Ontario. <note place="foot" n="3">Canada and its neighbour Colonies, <date value="1774">1774</date>-<date value="1833">1833</date>.</note>In <date value="1774">1774</date> Lord North had wisely passed
the Quebec Act, which left the French Canadians their law,
church, aristocracy, and government. The new Canadians of
English race soon began to grumble at the despotic rule of
the Crown and the prevalence of French ways and Popery.
In <date value="1791">1791</date> <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> met them half way by the Constitution Act,
which divided the land into two parts, the Ottawa river
separating English Upper Canada from  French Lower
Canada. By giving each Province a Representative Assembly, elected by the people, <persName key="Pitt, William">Pitt</persName> sowed the first seeds
of Canadian liberty. But the Governor and the Executive
Council were independent of parliamentary votes, and looked
only to the Home Ministry and the Crown for guidance.
Fierce hostility grew up between the two races, and the
French colonists' love of old ways was bitterly resented by
the pushing English minority now found even in the Lower
Province. Upper Canada now made great strides forward,
and her lumber trade in yellow pine, stimulated by the
Protective laws with which England helped forward the
infant resources of her colonies, soon cut out the forests of
Norway in the English timber market. During the reign of
<persName key="George III.">George III.</persName> legislative assemblies of the Canadian fashion
were gradually granted to all the other North American
colonies, except Newfoundland, whose scanty population of
wandering fishermen was not intrusted with elective rights
until <date value="1833">1833</date>, when a settled folk had grown up round the coast.
But as yet British North America was but beginning its
new way of life.  Its great importance was altogether in
the future. The English population was still small, and
the French, though clever trappers and hunters, and
thrifty, peaceful farmers, had none of the nervous
go-ahead ways which hurry on the material progress of a new
country.</p>
  <p>After <date value="1783">1783</date> the West Indian Colonies were universally
looked upon as the greatest glory of the British Empire.

was the mighty island of Jamaica, which, with the Virgin
Islands, Anguilla and Antigua, remained as
results of the new wave of colonial enterprise
which Cromwell had begun and <persName key="Charles II.">Charles II.</persName> carried on. <note place="foot" n="4">The West Indies, <dateRange from="1783" to="1793">1783-93</dateRange>.</note>St.
Kitts, partly English since <date value="1625">1625</date>, became wholly English in
<date value="1702">1702</date>.  Grenada and the Grenadines were yielded up by
France in <date value="1763">1763</date>. The mahogany cutters of Honduras now
had a recognised right to their position. Of the four islands,
Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Tobago, which, disputed till <date value="1748">1748</date>, were declared neutral by the Treaty of
Aachen, England now only held two of the three ceded in
<date value="1763">1763</date>, Dominica and St. Vincent, for Tobago remained in
French hands, as the only lasting fruit of De Grasse's
brilliant career of conquest. Jamaica, the largest, and
<placeName key="Barbados">Barbados</placeName>, the richest and most densely populated, were
each governed separately. The rest, excluding the unimportant and distant Bahamas, were for most purposes divided
into two groups, the Leeward Islands, looking
north-east, and including all as far south as Dominica, and
the Windward Islands, beyond them, looking south-east.
All were now very prosperous.  The planter aristocracy
was so wealthy that many English capitalists invested in
West Indian estates, and, even as absentees, won a good
return for their money, and kept up constant dealings between colony and mother-country. The restrictions of the
Navigation Act were no burden to a class that sought no
maritime commerce, and got its flour, pork, and lumber,
without much trouble, from North America. English ships
conveyed to <placeName key="Liverpool">Liverpool</placeName>, Bristol, and Glasgow the sugar, rum,
and treacle of the islanders, where they found a ready
market.  The system of kidnapping poor helpless folk,
and the plan of sending out as white slaves convicts,
debtors, and paupers, were now at an end, and the
planters, who disliked the settlement of poor whites, fell
back more and more on the labour of their negro slaves,
who, after <date value="1713">1713</date>, could be bought cheaply from the monopolist English merchants. The better planters treated their
human property kindly enough, as good masters treat their
horses, but they put down all attempts at revolt with unspeakable brutality, and denied the negro all taste of civilisation or Christianity, lest he became discontented with
his hopeless and aimless life of toil. The planters had in
their own hands the government of the colonies, through
local assemblies, and except that they paid a heavy tribute,



<pb id="p.291" n="291"/>


which they could afford, they were as free from English
control as Virginia had been. But there was still danger
from France, and the ever-present fear of a black revolt in
a region where burning suns and yellow fever, even more
than planter policy, discouraged European settlements.
There was therefore no danger of a cry for separation,
even if after <date value="1783">1783</date> England had not been more careful not
to give offence, and more watchful of the beginnings of
insubordination. But the wonderful prosperity of the West
Indies was based on slavery and monopoly, and new and
strange teachings were already heard in the distance,
threatening an end to both.</p>
  <p>Between <dateRange from="1787" to="1791">1787 and 1791</dateRange> Granville <persName key="Granville, Sharp">Sharp</persName> and the Abolitionists started in Western Africa, where the English

the days of Elizabeth, the colony of Sierra Leone for free

St. Helena, a remote island in the Southern Atlantic, and
the Bermudas (<date value="1612">1612</date>), now more important than ever as a

off the convicts previously sent to America, and now shut
up uselessly in hulks, and even sent to perish miserably in

  <p>In <date value="1787">1787</date> Captain Phillip was sent out with several shiploads of convicts to prepare the way for the new colony. On

of harbours to the north of Botany Bay, which on experience he found to be less suitable for his settlement. On the
shores of Port Jackson soon rose a little village of convicts'
huts named Sydney, after the minister that furthered the
venture. But for many years <placeName key="New South Wales">New South Wales</placeName> languished.
None but convicts were sent there, and the infant colony
suffered severely from famine, and got a very bad name
from the wild disorders of its vicious and ignorant population. The outbreak of the great wars against France soon
turned English energies into other channels. Yet a beginning had been made of another New England in the
Antipodes.</p>

  <p>6. <note place="foot" n="13">Decay of the West Indies, <dateRange from="1815" to="1849">1815-49</dateRange>.</note>The new colonies were not all clear gain.  Except
the Cape, which was as yet of little importance, they
were all of the hot tropical sort, where the
English would only live as a leisurely property
-holding class, and they increased the
difficulties which the slave question now brought forward.
The republican energy and enthusiasm of France
had spread to her colonies, and the <quote>"coloured"</quote> men of
mixed descent had become hot disciples of <persName key="Rousseau, Jean Jacques">Rousseau</persName>,
and strong upholders of a fraternity that knew no distinction of race and colour. Hayti, the greatest of the
French West Indies, had been too large for English
conquest, and, throwing off the planter yoke, became a
black republic, which has ever since presented a hideous
travesty of French civilisation. The Maroons of Jamaica
rose in fierce outbreaks in sympathy with the Haytians.
The frightened planters became more brutal and severe to
their wretched slaves. Their main supply of cheap labour
was cut off when the slave-trade was made felony. The
return of peace found that Europe had learnt to make sugar
from beetroot and coffee from chicory, so that the demand
for West Indian produce began to fall off. A fresh blow to
the planters came when the Reformed Parliament abolished
negro slavery in <date value="1834">1834</date>. Twenty millions of compensation
seemed generous to English eyes, but it was very little to
the ruined planters, whose free labourers now refused to
work more than they chose, and <quote>"squatted"</quote> on small
patches of garden ground, where the bounty of sun and soil
gave them enough for their simple wants, preferring to live
an idle, happy, helpless animal existence to working hard
for comforts and rewards they were quite contented to do
without. Only in <placeName key="Barbados">Barbados</placeName>, where the dense population
prevented squatting, and made the negroes work or starve,
did any prosperity continue. Jamaica lost ground terribly,
for her large unoccupied tracts gave plenty of room for her
negroes to settle down in happy sloth. Guiana and Trinidad kept up some show of success by importing coolies from

the hills of <placeName key="India">India</placeName> to do the work the blacks refused. But
political difficulties now broke out with the blacks, who by
force of numbers began to carry everything before them,
so that many of the colonies in despair surrendered their
constitutions, and put themselves under the despotic rule of
the Crown, as the best thing under the circumstances. The
more vigorous of the white population drifted away. The
negroes still remained troublesome, and in <date value="1865">1865</date> a black
revolt in Jamaica was only repressed by the stern and
successful, but perhaps too indiscriminate, severity of Governor
Eyre. But before this a blow heavier even than the
emancipation of the negro had fallen upon the West Indies. For
a time the system of differential duties, which let in our
colonial products at cheaper custom rates than those from
foreign countries, kept up a faint gleam of prosperity. But
free trade in sugar came in with free trade in corn (<date value="1846">1846</date>),
and cut off the last hope. Slave-grown sugar from foreign
parts crowded out the free sugar of the British Indies, until
the bounty system of Europe drove out both alike, in favour
of the beet sugar of France and Germany. The result has
been the economic ruin of the West Indies. Yet even in
their decay they remain magnificent monuments of their
former greatness.  Their fall marks another step in the
decay of the old Colonial theories which finally disappeared
with the repeal of the Navigation Acts in <date value="1849">1849</date>. Propped
up by monopoly and slave labour, they could not hold their
own in the harder struggle that set in with free competition
in trade and industry. Yet we may well regret their fall,
and welcome the faint gleams of returning prosperity which
show that their decline will at least go no further.</p>
   <p>7.  <note place="foot" n="14">The new Colonial Policy.</note>As the tropical sugar colonies fell back, the colonies
 in temperate climates, with a population largely or alto gether European, came into greater
 importance. This made it easier for the new colonial
 policy to be adopted, which marks the beginning of the
 present reign. The growth of population, the irregularity
 of employment, and the lowness of wages, which led to the
 social and political disturbances of the first forty years of
 the century, turned thoughtful men to the question of emi gration.  It was seen that something more ought to be
 done than <quote>" shovel out"</quote> convicts to <placeName key="New South Wales">New South Wales</placeName>, and
 paupers to Canada. Steps were taken to encourage active
 and helpful citizens to seek a hew home and fortune in the
 vast tracts of unoccupied territory over which the British
 flag now waved. Grants of free lands were now offered to

any respectable settler; but the plan was not found to
work, for the uncleared plots of virgin forest or bush were
of very little use to the poor and ignorant colonist, who was
led by the system to dwell in soul-destroying isolation from
his neighbours, far away from all markets, and all means of
improvement.  <note place="foot" n="15"> <persName key="Wakefield, Edward Gibbon">Wakefield</persName>'s System of Colonisation, <date value="1829">1829</date>.</note>In <date value="1829">1829</date>, the brilliant, graphic, far-seeing
Edward Gibbon <persName key="Wakefield, Edward Gibbon">Wakefield</persName> wrote, in the prison into which
his daring and lawless deeds had cast him, a striking
epoch-making pamphlet against the prevailing methods.
<persName key="Wakefield, Edward Gibbon">Wakefield</persName> taught that a colony should, so far as
might be, reproduce the state of society in the
mother-country.  Land should not be given
away in huge lots, but sold in small parcels,
and the proceeds turned to improving the means of communication, providing the accessories and aids to cultivation and improvement, and promoting fresh immigration
Towns should be set up to provide markets, and stimulate
trade.  The result was that a Colonisation Society was
started in <date value="1830">1830</date>, and a new era in <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>n progress sets
in with the establishment of fresh colonies professedly based
on <persName key="Wakefield, Edward Gibbon">Wakefield</persName>'s system.</p>
  <p>The Colonies grew larger and stronger as the stream of
emigration flowed with ever-increasing rapidity from the
mother-country One result sprang immediately from this.
Large masses of Englishmen, freer and more unconventional
in their ways than those left at home, would never be satisfied with anything but the fullest rights of self-government.
There was now no wish to withstand such demands at home,
for public opinion was very careless about colonial questions
altogether, and more thoughtful men generally believed that
when colonies got strong enough, they would naturally fall
away from the mother-country, like America, and took no
pains to prevent such a result. The doctrine first taught in
Revolutionary France that colonies were parts of the mother-
country found no echo in the England of this period.  It
was an age of economists and laissez-faire, deaf to all
higher notions of an Imperial England. But it did the
right thing in gracefully yielding the colonial demands,
though it thought that in doing so it was simply ripening
them for independence.  The first step was to grant a
local Legislative Council, such as Canada got in <date value="1791">1791</date>. In
<placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>, the way to this was through nominee Councils,
such as that established in <date value="1828">1828</date> in <placeName key="New South Wales">New South Wales</placeName>. In
<date value="1840">1840</date> two-thirds of the Council of that colony were chosen
by popular election. For a time the government remained

<note place="top" n="1">[<date value="1812">1812</date>-<date value="1867">1867</date>.]</note>

independent of the Assembly. But then came the final step
of granting responsible government-by making the executive depend on the legislative. This process was completed
in <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName> in <date value="1856">1856</date>. The result was virtual independence,
for the only link now was the Governor, who, appointed by the
Crown, reigned, but did not govern. A vague appellate right
of the English Privy Council was the only other thing that
connected the Colonies and mother-country, save common
citizenship, common traditions, and common love for English
ways. The freedom which the American plantations had enjoyed since the seventeenth century was thus extended to the
new colonies. But the commercial dependence which had
tightly bound the old colonies, and which America had felt
too grievous to be borne, was now entirely removed, as the
new free-trade system was incompatible with all commercial
monopoly.  In a later generation, the Colonies, in many
cases, set up protective laws of their own, which have
powerfully helped on their infant industries, often to the loss
of those of England. English troops were at last removed,
and the work of self-defence was intrusted to the colonists
themselves. The mother-country carried out a more
constructive task in urging on the confederation of neighbouring
colonies with each other. But of late years the idea has
been slowly gaining ground of joining Colonies and mother-
country together in a wider scheme of Imperial Federation.</p>
   <p>The modern Colonial Empire falls into three great groups
-North America, <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>, and South Africa. We can best
follow their history by taking each group in turn, and seeing
how it has fared since the introduction of the new colonial
system.</p>
   <p>8. <note place="foot" n="16">North American Colonies.</note>During the first third of the nineteenth century affairs
got worse and worse in Canada. The popular Legislative
Councils constantly quarrelled with the Governments
responsible to England, and the increase
of the English element embittered the feud of the two
Provinces and the two races. The American War between
<dateRange from="1812" to="1815">1812 and 1815</dateRange> brought the Provinces together for a time, to
repel gallantly and successfully the invaders from the United
States. But after the Peace of Ghent things went back to
the old ways, and the French Canadians, led by Papineau,
stopped the supplies and drew up a list of ninety-two grievances. <note place="foot" n="17">The Rebellion of <date value="1837">1837</date>, and Lord Durham.</note>In <date value="1837">1837</date> discontent grew into revolt,
which even extended to the Upper Province,
which had grievances of its own, and contained
a party that sought annexation to the American Union.



<pb id="p.299" n="299"/>


But the risings were quashed, the country was put under
martial law, and Lord Durham, the strong-willed, vigorous
Radical, was sent out in <date value="1838">1838</date> to organise a new government.<note place="foot" n="18">Canadian Unity and Independence, <date value="1840">1840</date>.</note>
By his advice the two Canadas were joined together in <date value="1840">1840</date>, with a Parliament of two
Chambers, the Upper House consisting of life
members, and the Lower House chosen in equal proportions
from the two Provinces. This meant the subordination of
the French majority to the English minority, but as a
counter-concession the Executive Ministry was made directly
responsible to the Canadian Parliament. As time went on
the English got more numerous; though the French still
clung strongly to their national laws and customs, and the
system of union proved a dead failure, yet the grant of
virtual independence led to a further development of the
Canadas. A fresh step was taken during the governorship
of Lord Elgin (<dateRange from="1847" to="1854">1847-1854</dateRange>), who joined with the Canadian
Liberals in getting rid of the Crown and Church lands to the
peasantry, abolishing the feudal rights of the French
seigneurs, improving the navigation of the St. Lawrence, opening up roads, railways, telegraphs, and canals, and concluding
a Commercial Treaty with the United States. An attempt
was made by the Canadian Conservatives to get the Indemnity
Act passed in favour of the rebels of <date value="1837">1837</date> rescinded
by the Home Government, but Parliament refused to
interfere. It was the last time any attempt was made to
check the independence of Canada.</p>
  <p>The Canadian Conservatives now accepted the democratic system, against which they had contended for so
long, and were joined by the more moderate Liberals, while
the Clear-grits or extreme Radicals clamoured for annexation to the States. But the greatest difficulty still remained
with the French, and deadlocks and disputes sapped the
energies of the colony for nearly thirty years. At last in
<date value="1861">1861</date> the Civil War in the United States burst out, and
made every Canadian feel keenly the divided and defenceless state of British North America. The commercial treaty
with the United States lapsed, and the Fenian invasions
of <date value="1866">1866</date> revealed a new danger.  The result was that
the plans for joining together the scattered colonies in a
common dominion, which had, hitherto, been started with
little enthusiasm, came within the region of practical
politics. In <date value="1867">1867</date> negotiations were completed, Sir John

  <p><note place="foot" n="19">The Dominion of Canada, <date value="1867">1867</date>.</note>The Dominion of Canada was now formed under a
Governor-General appointed by the Crown, and with a constitution similar in essentials to that of England,
with the large modifications made necessary by
the acceptance of Federalism. The government was to be
carried on by a Cabinet responsible to a Parliament of two
houses, of which the House of Commons was elected by a
liberal suffrage, and the Senate consisted of members chosen
for life. The Federal principle, as in the United States,
allowed a full measure of Home Rule to the Provinces of
the Dominion, which each had their separate local Parliament and Executive. The union of the two Canadas was given
up as hopeless, and French Canada, as the new Province of
Quebec, and English Canada as the Province of Ontario,
progressed much quicker after their ill-matched elements
were kept apart. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at once
joined the Union. In <date value="1870">1870</date>, Manitoba, the rough western
region which the growth of the corn trade was soon making
important, became a new Province, the defeat of the revolt

having practically settled its future as English and not

the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific (including
Vancouver's Island), which had become important since gold discoveries in <date value="1858">1858</date>, also fell in on the condition of a railway
being built to join them with the eastern colonies. In <date value="1872">1872</date>
Prince Edward's Island was included, so that Newfoundland
alone stood outside the Dominion. Sir John <persName key="Macdonald, John, Sir">Macdonald</persName>
became Conservative Premier of the Dominion, and though
defeated in <date value="1873">1873</date> by Mackenzie, got back into office in <date value="1878">1878</date>,
and brought in higher customs duties to protect Canada
against the United States and Europe. In <date value="1885">1885</date> the
Canadian Pacific Railway was opened between Canada and
British Columbia, so that an unbroken railway route was
established between Halifax and the Pacific coast. In the
same year <persName key="Riel, Louis">Riel</persName>'s second rising was put down, and its leader
executed. The Dominion, despite great difficulties, proved a
magnificent success.  In <date value="1887">1887</date> it contained nearly five

  dependency of <placeName key="New South Wales">New South Wales</placeName>. In <date value="1841">1841</date> the
  three islands became an independent colony
  with Auckland as their capital. But they had a great difficulty, especially in North Island, with the fierce, strong, and
  intelligent natives called Maoris, who were made of much
  sterner stuff than the weakly and archaic aboriginals of
  <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>. <persName key="Wakefield, Edward Gibbon">Wakefield</persName>'s fertile brain here hit on the notion
  of sending out separate colonies, each professing the same
  religious belief. In <date value="1848">1848</date> he settled Scotch Presbyterians in
  Otago, and in <date value="1850">1850</date> Church of England colonists in Canterbury, while English Nonconformists were gathered together
  at New Plymouth.    The result was that nine separate
  colonies gradually grew up in New Zealand, whose scattered
  and divided governments soon proved most burdensome
  and unsatisfactory, though there was a separate central
  government as well. At last in <date value="1875">1875</date>, after a hot struggle,
  the provinces were abolished, and New Zealand became a
  single colony, which has since grown rapidly, though some  times, like other young peoples, trusting so completely to its
  future development as to plan vast and costly works,
  and saddling itself with a large debt, which, with its
  present resources, is a somewhat heavy burden.</p>

  the military government of the days of the convict establishments.
  The free inhabitants loudly demanded
  self-government, and some even sought to give
  the emancipists, or convicts on leave, the rights
  of citizenship.  But the cry was now against
  transportation altogether, and after <date value="1840">1840</date> no more criminals
  were <quote>"shovelled"</quote> into <placeName key="New South Wales">New South Wales</placeName>, though
  transportation thither was not formally abolished till <date value="1853">1853</date>.
  Constitutional rule now bit by bit replaced martial law.  A
  Council was set up by Lord <persName key="Stanley, Edward, 14th Earl of Derby">Stanley</persName>, the Colonial Secretary,
  when Darling was Governor, in <date value="1842">1842</date>. In <date value="1850">1850</date> the <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>n Government Act was passed empowering the Home
  ministers to give Councils to the other colonies, and allowing the Councils, with the assent of the Crown, to alter their
  own constitution. To these bodies the government lands



<pb id="p.303" n="303"/>


were altogether transferred, and they soon began to use
their powers by making their constitution more democratic.
This had hardly been done when the discovery of gold in
<placeName key="Victoria">Victoria</placeName> (<date value="1851">1851</date>) brought about a new era of wild excitement
and speculation, and the enormous growth of every <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>n colony. Between <dateRange from="1850" to="1856">1850 and 1856</dateRange> the population of <placeName key="Victoria">Victoria</placeName> went up from 80,000 to 400,000. A pushing vigorous
society thus grew up, which in <date value="1855">1855</date> received a complete
measure of responsible government such as had earlier been
given to Canada. There now grew up in each colony a fierce
democratic feeling which has strongly coloured their whole
subsequent progress. Henceforth their expansion became
quite independent of the mother-country.  The colonies
soon found plenty of troubles of their own. There arose a
great struggle between protectionists and free traders (<date value="1863">1863</date>),
and a more bitter strife between the rich Squatters who had
become a sort of territorial aristocracy, and those who sought
to keep landed property in many hands, and encourage
corn-growing rather than sheep-farming. Sydney and Melbourne
became great cities with large manufactures and a great
artisan population. But though the legal tie between free
<placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName> and England remains but nominal, and their
interests seem as often to clash as to unite, the sentiment
of English nationality still binds together colony and mother-
country, and has brought about a promising and substantial
proof of sympathy in the despatch of <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>n forces to
the Red Sea to help in the relief of Gordon and the preservation of the Soudan. Since <date value="1885">1885</date> a Federal Council for
<placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName> has been set up by the States themselves; but New
Zealand and <placeName key="New South Wales">New South Wales</placeName> hold aloof, and the Council
is as yet simply for discussion and consultation, though it, or
some similar body, may become the germ of a confederation.</p>

In <date value="1819">1819</date> Singapore was established as the centre of the

a new colony in Oceania. Still more recently establishments
have begun in the vast island of New Guinea. But these
settlements are analogous to Indian conquests or Dutch
trading-stations rather than to the direct expansion of England into new regions. Yet they mark no unimportant movement. Shut off from other colonies, the trading nations of
Europe have begun to seek in the Pacific the settlements that
have become impossible for them elsewhere. It does not
become England to stand aside in a new colonial movement.</p>

the West Indian type of colony, while in some ways
suggesting analogies with Canada.  It is a
genuine colony, whither Dutchmen in the
eighteenth century and Englishmen in the nineteenth
have fared in large numbers to seek their fortunes. But the
native races have always been, and will certainly remain,
the great majority of the population.  Its history therefore is complicated by the strife of African and European as
well as the national hostility of Dutch and English. Partly
in consequence of these difficulties, its progress has been
much slower than that of Canada or <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>.</p>
  <p><note place="foot" n="31">Cape Colony</note>When the Peace of Paris finally handed over the Cape
Colony to the English, it was ruled by a hardy and stubborn
race of Dutch farmers, mutinous against
the exclusive government of the old Dutch
days, and cherishing the self-government they had won
through rebellion before the English occupied their land.
They were all stern Calvinists, seeking in the Old Testament their justification for enslaving the Hottentots and the
other native races of South Africa. Like the French in
Canada, their old-fashioned ways led them to look with
great disgust on the adventurous English settlers, who soon
began to arrive, though for a long time in small numbers.
They were angry that the English had abolished the
slave-trade, and resented with still greater bitterness the abolition of slavery itself. After <date value="1820">1820</date> the Eastern Province of
Cape Colony began to be settled by the English Government, and Port Elizabeth was founded. The progress of the
English East soon began to rival that of the

waxed warmer. <note place="foot" n="32">The Great Trek, <date value="1835">1835</date>.</note>In <date value="1835">1835</date> the original Dutch of the Eastern

Cape Colony.   Some of the Boers or Dutch
farmers remained behind the Drakenberg in the
region of the Orange River, where others of the

occupied such vast territories with such scanty numbers that
they could not defend themselves from the Griquas, a race

was disturbed, until in <date value="1877">1877</date> the British Government annexed
the South African Republic. A little earlier the discovery of
diamonds in the Orange Republic had led to more settlers

events little creditable to English soldiers or English statesmen. The rejection of confederation in Cape Colony itself
concluded a well-meant but hopeless scheme. What the
less settled parts of South Africa want is more railways and
free communication; the infiltration of English colonists,
now rapidly coming in to work the gold and diamond
mines, will at last settle the Dutch question, as it did the
French difficulty in Canada.</p>
  <p>12. <note place="foot" n="40">The Colonies in <date value="1887">1887</date>.</note>The British dominions now extend over eight million
square miles of the earth's surface.  Besides myriads of
native races, there are ten million colonists of
European descent, the mass of them enjoying
complete self-government, and being bound to the
mother-country only by what we call <quote>"sentimental"</quote> ties. Yet the
great growth of Canada, of <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>, and of South Africa
must be in the future. In any case that future must belong
to the English race. But it is a question slowly forcing itself
on thoughtful minds-whether, if the extension of the English race is thus assured, the English State should not be
extended too.  The success of the Federal system in the
United States, and the more modest success of Canadian
Federation, has shown how a vast population dispersed
over immense distances can be kept together in a real
unity, in spite of tremendous difficulties. No greater object
can employ British statesmen than the effort to bring the
scattered populations of old and new England into a world-wide

empire by means of the same Federal principle. The
difficulties are great, and every party must make sacrifices,
but the rewards are great also. The present nominal union
of feelings and affection may suffice until some sudden
trouble snaps the slight cord and brings about complete
separation. The other alternative is some scheme of Imperial Federation, which would bring about a greater State
than the world has seen since the Roman Empire, and be
the greatest assertion of the principle of Nationality that
could be secured.  Nothing in modern times is more
pregnant with fateful consequences than the new migration
westward and southward into a Greater Britain.</p>
