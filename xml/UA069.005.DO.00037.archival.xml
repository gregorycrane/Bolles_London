<head>PREFACE</head>
<p>THIS volume is intended to fill the gap between
Professor York Powell's First Part of a School History
of England and the Third Part (dealing with modern
times), by Professor Tout, both of which have already
appeared.  Unforeseen circumstances have prevented
the original plan for the completion of this Second
Part from being carried out. The present writer, who
only undertook it in the spring of <date value="1897">1897</date>,
is not responsible for the delay in its appearance.
The author has aimed at writing on the lines
originally laid down by his colleague Professor York
Powell, to whom he again desires to express gratitude
for his valuable advice and assistance. He also wishes
to thank his friends, Mr. C. H. Firth and Mr. James
Tait, who have kindly read over his proofs for him, and
made many useful corrections and suggestions.</p>

<head type="sub">
THE TUDOR MONARCHY AND THE
REFORMATION.<dateRange from="1509" to="1603">1509-1603</dateRange>.</head>
<p>DURING the last years of the fifteenth century the dying
Middle Ages slowly wore themselves out.  Even amidst
the aimless conflicts of the final stages of the Wars of the
Roses, we can discern the beginnings of a brighter state of
things.</p>
<p>The civil wars had destroyed medieval constitutionalism,
which had fallen into ceaseless faction and the rule of
the nobles and their retainers. Both the Yorkist Edward
IV. and the Lancastrian <persName key="Henry VII">Henry VII</persName>. had agreed in upholding
a strong monarchy as the best remedy against weak
rule and factious strife. The son of <persName key="Henry VII">Henry VII</persName>. and the
grandson of <persName key="Edward IV">Edward IV</persName>. now carried out their policy to its
* uttermost results, and built up the Tudor despotism that
was to culminate in the reign of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. If England
lost something in liberty, it gained by the setting up of
peace and order, under which every man was free to work
out his own life. The Tudor despotism was strong because
it was both national and popular. Established on the
ruins of the medieval church and nobility, it had as its
constant allies the mass of the English people. The policy
of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. and <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> was the policy of the wisest
Englishmen of the time.</p>
<p>The long series of far-reaching changes that marked the
Tudor period was carried out more easily, when the ship
of State was steered by pilots strong and cunning enough
to weather the storm of revolution. Under the great Tudor
kings, the transition from medieval to modern times was
successfully accomplished.</p>




<pb id="p.2" n="2"/>
<p>The institutions of the Middle Ages were now disappearing
on every side. It was the age of the Renascence,
or the new birth of thought and learning. It was the time
of the Reformation and of the break-up of the majestic
unity of the Medieval Church. It was the time when the
modern European State System grew up on the ruins of
the theoretical unity and real diversities of the political
system of the Middle Ages.  Among the great national
states in whose hands lay the future destinies of Europe,
the genius of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. and Wolsey secured a place for
England, and the patient skill of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> won back this
position, after it had been lost for a time under <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>.
and Mary. <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. had striven to set up a national
church, purged from foreign rule and superstition, a church
which would faithfully register the will of the monarch. But
the continuity with previous tradition, on which Henry kept
a tight hold, bade fair to disappear, when the counsellors of
<persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>. established a revolutionary Protestantism,
under cover of which they could forward their own selfish
interests. Fearing lest ecclesiastical reformation meant
revolution, England under <persName key="Tudor, Mary">Mary</persName>went back not unwillingly
to the unreformed religion. But neither the one nor the other
extreme would permanently satisfy the country, and <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
in Church as in State returned to the middle way
of her father.
</p><p>In the second half of the century the outlook became
more and more troubled. The ancient religion had reformed
itself, and the Counter-Reformation seemed likely to win
back the Protestant countries to the old way of thinking.
A fierce religious strife broke up the whole of Europe into
two hostile camps, and in the end Protestantism barely
held its own in the Teutonic States of the north. The
skilful policy of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> saved the English Reformation,
and restored the greatness of the English State. Under
her England became independent and triumphant, both in
Church and State. <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> was conquered; the Union
of the English and Scottish crowns was prepared for. Free
and prosperous England had at last the leisure and the
means to enter fully into the larger life of modern times.
Then blossomed the English Renascence, and the new outburst
of thought and activity, whose greatest product was the
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>an drama. Englishmen were now able to avail
themselves of the great discoveries, both of nature and
man, that had revolutionised Europe nearly a hundred
years before. Englishmen were now able to do and to



 <pb id="p.3" n="3"/><note place="foot" n="1"><date value="1509">1509</date></note>
think, as they had never done or thought before. Englishmen
now became famous adventurers, navigators, discoverers,
colonisers. The many-sided energies of the time
outflowed the limits of our little islands.  It was in the
" spacious times of great <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> " that modern England
began to live. How full and rich this life was, we can
see, not only in the statecraft of the great queen, or in the
dramas of<persName key="Shakespeare, William">Shakespeare</persName> and his fellows, or in the verse of
Spenser and in the prose of Hooker, or in the adventures
of Drake and Frobisher and Raleigh; but not least clearly
in the strength and force of the anonymous song-writer, or
half-known dramatist, or in the high quality of the deeds
of many a nameless hero of the Spanish Main or the
religious wars. It was the most heroic time of English
history.</p>

king. " Nature," declared an enthusiastic Venetian ambassador,
"could not have done more for him."<note place="foot" n="1"> character and policy of<persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.</note>
Even as a boy his precocity in intellect and
manners had powerfully impressed the great
scholar Erasmus. As a young man, he was the handsomest
and ablest of the sovereigns of Christendom. He
was tall and well-proportioned: "his complexion very
fair and bright, with auburn hair, combed straight and
short in the French fashion, and a round face that would
become a pretty woman." He was "very accomplished;
a good musician and composer; a most capital horseman,
and a fine jouster. He speaks good French, Latin, and
Spanish; is very religious, hearing three masses a day when
he hunts and five on other days." He was "extremely
fond of hunting, never taking his diversion without tiring
eight or ten horses. He was devoted to tennis," at which
game "it is the prettiest thing in the world to see him play,
his fair skin glowing through a shirt of the finest texture."
He delighted to set off his stately form in rich attire, glittering
with jewels and gold. No monarch ever knew better
how to play the ceremonial part of kingcraft. His gracious



<pb id="p.4" n="4"/>   <note place="foot" n="2">[<date value="1509">1509</date>-<date value="1510">1510</date>.]</note>
smile and friendly hearty manner concealed his utter
selfishness, and won the hearts of rich and poor alike; but
he had a keen sense of his dignity and his anger was
terrible to face. It speaks well for his nobler qualities that
he never altogether lost his subjects' love, even in those
later days, when broken health and baffled ambitions had
soured his disposition and inflamed his temper. He was a
shrewd judge of character and chose his ministers well, but
he used them as mere instruments, throwing them off
remorselessly when they had fulfilled their purpose or
ventured to cross his wishes. He was a thorough Englishman,
and knew what his subjects wanted; but he took no
pains to persuade or humour them, dragging them by
main force along the course which he himself had appointed,
and crushing opposition by brute force. Fierce, strong,
masterful, and unscrupulous, he had no touch of mercy or
softness about him. Ever a hard, cruel, remorseless master,
he became in later life a hateful tyrant. Yet he never quite
lost the grandeur and force of purpose that make him one
of the strongest and ablest of English kings. He worked
for himself, but he also worked for England, and though he
wrought much evil in his day, the good that came from the
main lines of his policy lived on. All our subsequent
history bears the strong impress of his lion-like will and
heroic determination.</p><p>
In the early years of his reign, Henry seemed to careless
observers absorbed in the round of pleasures and distractions,
into which he had plunged with all the impetuosity of
his character. But he loved fame more than he loved tilting
and tennis, and he loved having his own way more than
he loved even glory.  He kept a tight control over his
ministers, not only retaining in his own hands all the chief
strings of policy, but busying himself with increasing
delight in all the details of administration. He had been
well educated, and not only understood war and politics,
but had a taste for old-fashioned theology, as well as
sympathies with the newlearning, which made the scholars
indulge in the most sanguine hopes of him. But no vision
of impossible ideals dimmed his practical shrewdness of
purpose. Coming to the throne with an undoubted title,
and inheriting his father's well-filled coffers as well as
theresults of his painful and laborious policy, he felt
that he was strong enough to play a great part in the
world. To stamp out the last relics of opposition, to
subject the last of the old nobles and the most obstinate of



       <pb id="p.5" n="5"/>
the great churchmen to his imperious despotism were his
chief objects of policy at home, while abroad he aimed at
reviving the leading position that England had held in the
fourteenth century in the counsels of Europe. With the
new king the new spirit was seated on the throne.</p><p>
2. In carrying out his schemes, the young king at
first relied mainly on the tried servants of his father.
<persName key="Henry VII">Henry VII</persName>. had been his own chief minister, and had
had under him two kinds of helpers. Of the first sort
were the dignified magnates who held the great offices, like
William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Richard
Fox, Bishop of Winchester. Of the second were the subordinate
agents of inferior position, mere clever tools to
give effect to the royal will, such as the extortioners
Empson and Dudley. The young king continued  <note place="foot" n="3"> Henry's ministers.</note>
Warham as Chancellor and Fox as
Keeper of the Privy Seal, but the morose Warham contented
himself with discharging the routine duties of his office,
and the pious Fox, though zealously working in the king's
service, was anxious to give up diplomacy and devote the
end of his days to the careful administration of his diocese
and to the carrying out of his great educational foundations
at Oxford and elsewhere. The Secretary of State, Bishop
Ruthal of Durham, was a dull, hardworking man; and
among the secular nobles the most conspicuous was Thomas
Howard, Earl of Surrey, "a man endowed with great
prudence, gravity, and constancy," who remained Treasurer.
All these stayed in office for many years, and retired of their
own accord, for all through his reign Henry kept his ministers
in power as long as they remained useful to him. But one
of the king's first acts was to win a little cheap popularity
by sacrificing to popular hatred the most famous of his
father's subordinate agents.  Empson and    <note place="foot" n="4"> Execution ofEmpson andDudley.</note>
Dudley were sent to the Tower, and speedily
attainted on absurd charges of treason and
conspiracy against the new king.  In <date value="1510">1510</date> both were
brought to the block.</p><p>
3. If Henry's great schemes were to be carried out, some
abler and more strenuous helper was wanted than the
dignified officials who monopolised the high  <note place="foot" n="5"> Thomas Wolsey,<dateRange from="1471" to="1530">1471-1530</dateRange>.</note>
posts of State. The rise of Thomas Wolsey
gave Henry a minister after his own heart. Wolsey was
the son of a wealthy grazier and wool merchant of Ipswich,
whom his enemy, the satirist Skelton, denounced as a
butcher. He gained distinction at a very early age at



<pb id="p.6" n="6"/>             <note place="foot" n="6"> <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. and Wolsey [<date value="1510">1510</date>-<date value="1515">1515</date>.]</note>
Magdalen College, Oxford, where he became master of the
grammar school and acquired his first business training as
bursar of the college.  The new learning hardly touched
his eminently practical intellect, and he soon left Oxford
to serve as chaplain to Archbishop Deane of Canterbury.
Before long the favour of Bishop Fox gained him a footing
at court, and he proved his ability in several diplomatic
missions, which gave him insight into the crooked and
weak methods of <persName key="Henry VII">Henry VII</persName>.'s statecraft. In <date value="1509">1509</date> he was
made Dean of Lincoln, and, though holding no higher
office at the young king's court than that of Almoner, he
rapidly became the most influential of Henry's younger
counsellors. When in <date value="1513">1513</date> Henry embarked on war with
France, the clever Almoner's advice became indispensable.
Henceforth a great official like Bishop Ruthal was content
to "sing treble to Wolsey's bass." In <date value="1514">1514</date> Wolsey became
Bishop of Lincoln, and, before the end of the year Archbishop
of York. In <date value="1515">1515</date> the Pope made him a Cardinal.
In the same year Warham gave up the Chancellorship in
his favour, and henceforth allowed himself to be effaced by
the rising sun. For the next sixteen years Wolsey was
supreme, both in Church and State.  Fresh preferment
was heaped upon him, till he disposed of the revenues of
three or four bishoprics and of one of the richest abbeys.
His pomp and ostentation excited the envy of the greatest
nobles. His intimate friendship with the king enabled him
to control Henry's policy as no other minister of the reign
ever did, and he was shrewd enough never to gainsay the
fierce king's wishes. " He is the person," wrote the Venetian
ambassador, "who rules both the king and the kingdom." "He is,"
says the same authority, "very handsome,
learned, extremely eloquent, of vast ability, and indefatigable. He alone transacts all the business that occupies all
the magistrates, offices, and councils of Venice. He has the
reputation of being extremely just. He favours the people
exceedingly, and especially the poor, hearing their suits
and making the lawyers plead gratis for them." He had
plenty of enemies, such as the poet Skelton who complained how-
<quote rend="blockquote">"He is set so high
In his hierarchy
Of frantic phrenesy
And foolish phantasy,
That in the Chamber of Stars
All matters there he mars:
Clapping his rod on the board:
No man dare speak a word."</quote>



            <pb id="p.7" n="7"/>
He was no ascetic, and had little care for the law of the
Church-
<quote rend="blockquote">"In Lent for a repast
He eateth capons stewed,
Pheasant and partridge mewed."</quote>
Many envied him, and the old nobles hated him, but he
was, with all his faults, the ablest statesman of his time,
and without his rare diplomatic and organising skill the
young king's reign would have been shorn of its greatest
glories.
</p><p>4. Foreign politics from the beginning attracted Henry
VIII.'s main attention. The two chief powers were now
France and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. <placeName key="France">France</placeName> was the most       <note place="foot" n="7"> Foreignaffairs,<dateRange from="1509" to="1515">1509-1515</dateRange>.</note>
compact, best governed, and most patriotic of
European nations. <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> had, in the last generation,become
united by the marriage of Ferdinand, King of Aragon, with
Isabella, Queen of Castile, after which the Moors, who had
hitherto reigned in the south, had been driven out. It was
now being enriched by the wealth of the mines of America,
which <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> was rapidly appropriating for herself. Far
inferior in importance was <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>, which was split up
into many states, and almost as divided as Italy: but
there was still some faint German national feeling, and
the Roman Emperor, as the king of the Germans still
called himself, had some authority over its little princes,
besides deriving more solid power from his hereditary
dominions in Southern <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName> (including Austria and
the neighbouring duchies), and from the rich territories of
the Netherlands, which he held through his marriage with
<persName key="Tudor, Mary">Mary</persName>of Burgundy, daughter and heiress of Charles the
Bold. Since the famous expedition of <persName key="Charles VIII">Charles VIII</persName>. to
Italy in <date value="1494">1494</date> had revealed to northern Europe the wealth
and the weakness of highly civilised, luxurious, and
cultivated Italy, European politics had gradually settled
down into a contest between the great nations. in which
supremacyover the little states beyond the Alps was the
prize of victory. The French king, Louis XII., had made
himself Duke of Milan. His rival, Ferdinand of Aragon,
had conquered the kingdom of Naples and Sicily. The
Emperor Maximilian strove to establish himself in Italy at
the expense of Venice. Every small Italian state took the
side of one or the other, and so did its best to bring about
the ruin of the country. In <persName key="Henry VII">Henry VII</persName>.'s days England
had generally allied itself to <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, and <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.



<pb id="p.8" n="8"/>       <note place="foot" n="8"> [<date value="1508">1508</date>--<date value="1513">1513</date>.]</note>
renewed the Spanish alliance, when, immediately after his
accession, he carried out his long-deferred marriage with
Ferdinand's daughter, Catharine of Aragon, his brother
Arthur's widow.   But Ferdinand had treated   England

             and the Emperor had  for the   moment
buried their disagreements and had united with many of
the Italian powers in the League of Cambrai against Venice,
the wealthy aristocratic republic that all Italy feared and
envied. It seemed as if the great coalition would at once
destroy Venice, but the Venetians were clever diplomatists
and set to work to create dissensions among their ill-assorted
enemies. Before long they succeeded. Julius I I., the warlike
Pope, took the alarm lest the destruction of Venice should
lead to the absolute preponderance of the French in the
<note place="foot" n="10">The Holy League,<date value="1511">1511.</date>  </note>
Peninsula. By <date value="1511">1511</date> hejoined with the Venetians,
                          Ferdinand of Aragon, and the Emperor
Maximilian in a new league, whose object was to drive the
French out of Italy. This league was called the Holy
League because the Pope was at the head of it.
Henry had been kept out of all opportunity of taking a
side in continental politics by the union of all the powers in
the League of Cambrai. He rejoiced to find that the continental
states had broken up into two factions, so that he
had a chance of adopting a line of his own. He joined the
Holy League, hoping to gain glory by renewing the old
policy of the Edwards and Henrys of attacking<placeName key="France">France</placeName>,
and was welcomed by the powers whose interests centred
in Italy, since they would have a better chance of driving
Louis XII. out of Milan, if the French had to repel an
English assault on their frontier as well as defend Lombardy.
To neutralise the English power,<placeName key="France">France</placeName> as usual
stirred up <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> to attack England, and James IV.,
though the husband of Henry's sister Margaret, eagerly
prepared to cross the Border.</p><p>
5. In <date value="1512">1512</date> there was war all over Europe. The Holy league
drove the French out of Milan, and Ferdinand invaded Navarre south
<note place="foot" n="11">Wars of the Holy League <date value="1512">1512</date> -<date value="1514">1514</date></note>
of the Pyrenees, held by a king who was but a great
  French nobleman. Henry prepared to take an active
part in thewar, and Wolsey energetically busied himself
in equipping the English armies. It was agreed between Henry and
Ferdinand that a simultaneous attack should be made on<placeName key="France">France</placeName> from
two points at once. The Marquis of Dorset was sent with a large



                      <pb id="p.9" n="9"/>
force to co-operate with the Spaniards in an attempt to win back the
English king's old possessions in Guienne, while from the open gate of
Calais a strong English ai my was to pour into the north
of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>. Dorset's expedition was a sorry failure. 							<note place="foot" n="12">Dorset in <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>,<date value="1512">1512</date></note>
England had been so long unused to continental
warfare that even Wolsey's energy could not prevent a hopeless collapse
of the commissariat.  The English troops were raw and untrained,
and their discipline soon broke down under the privations to
which the unreadiness of their leaders, and the hot sun and drenching
rains of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> exposed them. " The greatest lack of victuals," they
complained to the king, " is of beer, for your subjects had liefer for to
drink beer than wine and cider; for the hot wines do harm them and
the cider doth cast them in sickness and disease." Moreover, the
cold policy of Ferdinand prevented them ever measuring swords with
the enemy. It suited the Spanish king to use them to complete his
conquest of Navarre, rather than help them to invade Guienne. Before
the end of August mutiny broke out, and the angry and suffering troops
forced their weak generals to take them back to England. It was a
disastrous and disgraceful beginning. Our continental allies began to
distrust us. "Englishmen have so long abstained from war," said the
Emperor's daughter, "they lack experience, from disuse; and, if
report be true, they are sick of it already."</p><p>
Henry and Wolsey redoubled their efforts, and the campaign of
<date value="1513">1513</date> was at least no such utter failure as that of the previous year. In
the spring of the year a gallant attack on the French galleys as they
lay in shallow water retrieved the reputation of the English for courage,
though it cost the life of the brave admiral Sir Edward Howard. In
July Henry and his great army started from Calais on
an invasion of Northern<placeName key="France">France</placeName>.  The moneyless 		 <note place="foot" n="13">Guinegatte,Therouanne, andTornai, <date value="1513">1513</date>.</note>
Maximilian joined him with some German troops, and
did not think it beneath the dignity of Caesar Augustus
to take Henry's pay. The French did not resist very strenuously:
their best troops were in Italy; and when Henry intercepted a large
French force at Guinegatte, on I6th August, the enemy fled so speedily
that they used their spurs more than their swords, and the English
called the fight the Battle of the Spurs. This victory led to the
capture of the two important towns of Thr-ouanne and Tournai, of
which latter city Wolsey, who had taken part in the whole campaign,
was now made bishop.</p><p>
On the eve of the Battle of the Spurs, a herald from James IV. had
warned Henry that the Scots intended to invade England, if the English
persisted in their invasion of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>. But not an
English trooper was sent home to meet this new danger. <note place="foot" n="14"><date value="1513">1513</date> Flodden Field</note>
The Lord Treasurer, Surrey, hurried to the north
to put the frontier in a state of defence, and Queen Catharine herself
took the lead in equipping the army destined to fight the Scots. " You
are not so busy with war in Thdrouanne," she wrote to Wolsey, " as I
am encumbered with it in England. They are all here very glad to
be busy with the Scots, for they take it for a pastime. My heart is
very good to it, and I am horribly busy with making standards,
banners, and badges." Early in August James IV. crossed the Tweed
with a "well-fed and fat army, much ordnance, plenty of victuals,"
including excellent beer. He easily captured and destroyed Norham
and other Border castles. On Surrey's approach James took up a



<pb id="p.10" n="10"/>           <note place="foot" n="15">   [<date value="1513">1513</date>--<date value="1515">1515</date>.]</note>
strong position on Flodden Edge, a hill a few miles south of the Tweed,
where the little river Till protected one of his flanks and a deep
morass the other. In the chivalrous fashion of the time Surrey challenged


<figure id="Fig.010" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.012.DO01.00010"><head>Battle of Flodden</head></figure>

 James to battle on the next Friday. The Till separated the
armies, but Surrey by marching northwards towards the Tweed force
James after all to fight at a disadvantage.  Fearing lest Surrey's northward
march threatened an invasion of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, James left his strong
position on Flodden Edge, and stationed his host on Branxton Hill,
some distance to the north. Meanwhile Surrey, desisting from his
northward march, crossed the Till at Twizel Bridge and turned southwards
on the Scots, in order to redeem his challenge. On 9th September
the battle took place.   As the English moved up towards
them the Scots came down from Branxton Hill and fought in the
plain. The English stood between the Scots and retreat to their own



                     <pb id="p.11" n="11"/>
country; and left them no chance but to fight desperately.  Each
side was arrayed in four '"battles" or divisions. Surrey's sons, Thomas
Howard, Admiral of England, and Sir Edmund Howard, commanded
the English right, and first encountered the foe. The "battle" commanded
by Surrey himself was over against the Scottish division commanded
by the king. In a hard hand-to-hand infantry fight, Janes
and his nobles atoned by their gallantry for the tactical errors that had
undone their gallant followers. To the last they blundered. Their
reserves never got into action, and the "battles" were so far apart
that they gave each other little support. The fierce Borderers on the
Scots left, under the Chamberlain of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, carried all before them.
However, Surrey in the centre prevailed over James, while the Highlanders
on the Scots right were easily routed by Sir E. Stanley and his
Lancashire archers on the English left, who climbed Branxton Hill
and took those fighting with King James on flank and rear. By this
nanceuvre the already half-beaten ranks of the Scots were utterly
broken. Darkness alone allowed a few to escape by circuitous roads
over the Border. James, with the bravest of the northern nobility,
lay dead on the field. As the poet Lindsay wrote
'<quote rend="blockquote"> I never read in tragedy or story
At one journey [day's work] so many nobles slain,
For the defence and love of their sovereign."</quote>
The victorious general was made Duke of Norfolk, a title lost to
the Howards when Surrey's father died fighting on the wrong side at
Bosworth field</p><p>
6. Next year the war languished and died out. Henry
was bitterly disappointed with his allies, and found his
father's treasures scattered, though<placeName key="France">France</placeName> was                    <note place="foot" n="16"> Peace with<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, <date value="1514">1514</date>.</note>
far from being beaten.  He was as angry with
his father-in-law as with the French,
gladly accepted the overtures for a treaty made by Louis
XI I., who, being finally driven out of Italy, was anxious to end
his days in peace. The warlike Julius II. was dead, rejoicing
that the barbarians had been driven over the Alps.
After Flodden, Henry's sister Margaret ruled over the
Scots in the name of her little son James V., and won over
the country to the English side. Accordingly it was easy
to make peace both with<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. The new
friendship with<placeName key="France">France</placeName> was cemented by the marriage of
Mary, Henry's younger sister, to the worn-out and brokendown
French king. Early in 15 5 Louis died, and Mary, who
had married once to please her brother, chose                   <note place="foot" n="17"><persName key="Tudor, Mary">Mary Tudor</persName> and her husbands.</note>
a second husband toplease herself. This was
her old lover Charles Brandon, Duke        of
Suffolk, a robust and handsome but dull young nobleman,
who was a personal friend and boon companion of Henry,
and had won some little distinction in fighting the French.

7. The six years that followed the treaty with the French
and Scots were years of unbroken peace for England,
<note place="foot" n="19">Foreignpolitics.<dateRange from="1515" to="1521">1515-1521</dateRange>.</note>
though the continental struggle was not ended
         till <date value="1516">1516</date>. The great feature of the time was
the dying off of the older generation of princes, in whose
places came young, ambitious, and capable rulers, the
contemporaries of Henry in age, and his rivals in energy and
ambition.  In <date value="1515">1515</date> Francis I. of<placeName key="France">France</placeName> succeeded his
cousin Louis XII. He was active and warlike, and refused
to acquiesce tamely in the loss of Milan. In the year of
his accession he crossed the Alps and won a great victory
at Marignano, thus forcing his enemies to make peace on
terms that restored to him the Duchy of Milan. In <date value="1516">1516</date>
Ferdinand of Aragon died, and was succeeded by his
grandson Charles of Austria, the son of Joanna, daughter
and heiress of Ferdinand and Isabella, by the Archduke
Philip of Austria, the son and heir of the Emperor Maximilian
and of <persName key="Mary of Burgundy">Mary of Burgundy</persName>, the only daughter of
Charles the Bold of Burgundy. The great Burgundian
inheritance in the Netherlands and the Free County of
Burgundy, between the Saone and the Jura, were now
joined to the inheritance of Ferdinand and Isabella,
Aragon, Castile, Navarre, Naples, and the vast American
dominion that the followers of Columbus were winning for
the Spaniards. In <date value="1519">1519</date> the old Emperor Maximilian died
also, and Charles succeeded as a matter of course to Austria
and all his hereditary dominions. The dignity of Roman
Emperor was, however, elective, and it was the interest of
the German princes not to have too powerful a ruler at
their head. Accordingly Francis I. entered into competition
with Charles for this office, but after a sharp
<note place="foot" n="20">The beginnings of the rivalry of <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>.Francis I.</note>
contest with Francis, Charles gained the day,
                 and was chosen in <date value="1519">1519</date> as the Emperor
                        and  <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>. It was plain that a long struggle
                        for supremacy would soon break out between
Francis and Charles. All the subordinate princes of Europe
ranged themselves on the side of one or the other, and
astute statesmen like the new Pope, Leo X., sought to set
up some sort of balance between them. Which side would
Henry take in the forthcoming war ?
</p><p>The foreign policy of the Middle Ages was largely based on
traditions of enmity and friendship.<placeName key="France">France</placeName> was the natural
enemy of England; and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, <placeName key="Flanders">Flanders</placeName>, and the Empire
were England's traditional allies. But the great changes
in European statecraft that had begun with <persName key="Charles VIII">Charles VIII</persName>.'s



              <pb id="p.13" n="13"/>
invasion of Italy had now led to the setting up of the idea
of the European political system and of the balance of
power. Europe was now looked upon as a           <note place="foot" n="21">The European Political systemand the Balance of Power</note>
single whole consisting of different independent
 parts, and each of the individual states
watched very carefully its neighbours' doings,
lest they should grow so powerful as to upset the European
balance. The establishment of compact national monarchies
on the ruins of feudalism and the Church made the kings
so strong that they were able to look abroad and busy
themselves in foreign affairs. What has been sometimes
called the mediaeval policy of principles and traditions
was now succeeded by a policy of interests. It was no
longer possible for a state to hold the same foreign policy
from generation to generation. What it now aimed at
was its own immediate interests. What it specially tried
to avoid was any growth of the power of its neighbours
which might prove likely to upset the European balance.
Now that <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. and Wolsey had again made England
a state of European importance, it was a critical
matter whether they would be moved by the old or the new
ideas.</p><p>
In the wars of the Holy League Henry had clung to
England's traditional policy, and had fought with his
ancestral allies against his ancestral foes. But      <note place="foot" n="22">Wolsey and the European Balance.</note>
he had found that all his skill was powerless
to win new Crecys or Agincourts, and that his
father-in-law and his other allies had made him their catspaw.
Accordingly Henry veered round to<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, and
the friendship which he had concluded with Louis XI I. was
renewed with Francis I., though Francis did his best to
defeat England's old allies, and had even broken down the
rule of Henry's sister in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> by setting up against her
his puppet the Duke of Albany as regent. For nearly six
years after Francis' accession England and<placeName key="France">France</placeName> remained
on friendly terms. But Wolsey's real object was
to make England the tongue of the balance between<placeName key="France">France</placeName>
and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>.  He wished to preserve the balance of power
which Charles rather than Francis seemed to threaten,
and he also wished to keep the peace, using England as a
makeweight or mediator between the two allies. He so
won over Francis that he persuaded him to recall Albany
to<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, though the misconduct of Margaret made it impossible
for her to regain power over <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>.  In <date value="1518">1518</date>
Wolsey had succeeded in joining all Europe together in a



<pb id="p.14" n="14"/>               <note place="foot" n="23">  [<date value="1519">1519</date>--<date value="1523">1523</date>.]</note>
union, the threads of which he held in his own hands. But
the contest for the Empire unsettled everything. The old
traditions were by no means dead. <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>. not only
represented all the traditional alliances of England. He
was Queen Catharine's nephew. His power, joined with that
of England, might well give Henry the chance of winning
back Normandy or Guienne from      Francis.  Moreover
Francis was far from being really a friend of England. There
were grave difficulties on both sides. Sometimes even the
policy of mediation seemed too cold and profitless, and
more ambitious thoughts haunted Henry and his minister.
Henry in <date value="1519">1519</date> posed as a candidate for the Empire.
Wolsey more than once was hopeful of being made Pope.
But these were but momentary feelings. Both were shrewd,
practical men and did not give up realities for visions.
</p><p>In <date value="1520">1520</date> war between Francis and Charles was on the
verge of breaking out. Both rivals competed eagerly for
<note place="foot" n="24">His policy of mediation <dateRange from="1519" to="1521">1519-1521</dateRange>. </note>
England's support and listened to Wolsey's
        peace-makingand mediating proposals. Henry
            and his minister had personal interviews with
both Francis and Charles. The conference between the
French and English kings took place on the Calais border,
and the two courts displayed such extraordinary pomp and
magnificence that men called the meeting-place the Field of
the Cloth of Gold. But nothing came either of the profuse
waste of money or of the elaborate protestations of friendship
<note place="foot" n="25">The Field of the Cloth of Gold,<date value="1520">1520</date>.</note>
between the two kings.  Before long
  Charles met Henry in a much humbler fashion
    at Gravelines. Wolsey now held a conference
at Calais, in which he professed to mediate between the
two rivals. But it was little more than a pretence. When
in <date value="1521">1521</date> open war broke out, England had to take a side
or see itself effaced. Despite all the fine talk of a French
alliance, Henry now declared himself a partisan of the
Emperor.</p><p>
8. The first war between Francis I. and <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>. began in <date value="1521">1521</date>,
and went on with one break until <date value="1529">1529</date>. It was almost uniformly
disastrous to<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, though Henry could not claim that

English soldiers had done much to contribute to the
  defeat of his enemy. With all his constant talk of
 war, and all the wearisome and insincere negotiations
with which Henry busied himself, his actual interventions
in continental warfare were few and not very brilliant. His
campaigns against<placeName key="France">France</placeName> in <date value="1522">1522</date> and <date value="1523">1523</date> were not more glorious
than his wars against the same enemy in <date value="1512">1512</date> and <date value="1513">1513</date>. In <date value="1522">1522</date>
Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, son of the victor of Flodden,



                      <pb id="p.15" n="15"/>
plundered the Breton coast with his ships, and afterwards led an army
of invasion into Picardy; but he did nothing but devastate the country
round about Boulogne. Next year Surrey was transferred to <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>,
whither Albany had returned on the outbreak of war,
hoping to effect a diversion on behalf of the French.         <note place="foot" n="27">Campaigns of Surrey and<dateRange from="1522" to="1523">1522-1523</dateRange></note>
But Surrey's brutal devastation of the Borders was
enough to teach the Scots their lesson. Albany was
a poor soldier, and retreated on Surrey's appearance.
The English rejoiced over an easy triumph, and Skelton wrote a poem
telling how Albany-
<quote rend="blockquote">"Like a coward knight,
He fled and durst not fight;
He ran away by night."</quote>
<placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> soon made a truce, and took no further part in the war.

Suffolk, Henry's brother-in-law, took Surrey's place in the second
invasion of<placeName key="France">France</placeName> that was projected for <date value="1523">1523</date>. But Suffolk proved a
wretched general, and the brave array that he led out of Calais
effected nothing commensurate with the expense of its equipment.

Meanwhile the real war was being fought out elsewhere. Despite the
gallantry of his soldiers, Francis was utterly driven out of Milan, Pope
Leo X. and the Italian princes banding together with the Emperor
against him. His kinsman, the Duke of Bourbon, plotted against
him and deserted to the enemy. On attempting, in <date value="1525">1525</date>, to win back
<note place="foot" n="29">Battle of Pavia <date value="1525">1525</date>.</note>
his Lombard inheritance, he was utterly defeated and
 taken prisoner at the great battle of Pavia, where
he lost, as he boasted, everything but his honour. He
bought his freedom by a promise to give up Burgundy, but on returning
to<placeName key="France">France</placeName> broke his word and renewed the war. This time the
Italian princes, with Pope Clement VII., Leo X.'s nephew and successor,
<note place="foot" n="30">Sack of Rome <date value="1527">1527</date>.</note>
at their head, feared the Emperor so much that they
            helped the French. But the imperial troops horrified
Europe by their bloody sack of Rome. The Pope
became a prisoner, and the Italian league was dissolved. Neither the
perfidy nor the bravery of Francis answered any good end. His troops
<note place="foot" n="31">Peace of Cambrai, <date value="1529">1529</date>.</note>
were finally expelled from Italy in <date value="1528">1528</date>, and in <date value="1529">1529</date> he
  was forced to sign the Peace of Cambrai on terms that
made <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>. absolute master of Italy. Henceforth
Italy was practically an imperial possession, and its petty
princes, with Clement VII. the foremost among them, were the abject
vassals of Charles. Crowned Emperor by the Pope, Charles dreamt
of renewing the old glories of the Medieval Empire. He was the
strongest prince in Christendom and might well aspire to be " lord
of the world " in fact as well as name.</p><p>
9. The foreign policy of England gradually changed as
the Emperor's successes became more and more brilliant.
<note place="foot" n="32">England and the French Alliance <dateRange from="1525" to="1529">1525-1529</dateRange>.</note>
The campaigns of <dateRange from="1522" to="1523">1522-1523</dateRange>, though failures,
  had exhausted Henry's resources and again
          brought home to him the impossibility of carrying
out an ambitious policy. Henceforth he took little part
in the war, though he remained the enemy of<placeName key="France">France</placeName> as far
as the name went.   After the battle of Pavia, he thought
once more for a moment of profiting by the calamities of
France to win back Normandy from the beaten kingdom
and the captive king. However, on maturer reflection, he
adopted a very different line. Instead of availing himself of
his nephew's victory to press<placeName key="France">France</placeName> hard, he took alarm at
the danger to the balance of power, which the threatened
preponderance of Charles bade fair to bring about. For
the first time in English history the new policy of interests
pointed in a different direction from the old policy of principles.
Wolsey, ever faithful to his instincts of mediation and
balancing, seized the opportunity. In <date value="1525">1525</date> he made peace
with<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, making as a pretext the Emperor's refusal to
co-operate in a policy of active invasion.  After his release
from his Spanish captivity, Francis was so anxious to renew
the war that he gladly offered very good terms for a closer



               <pb id="p.17" n="17"/>
alliance with England. There was talk of marrying the Lady
Mary, the only surviving child of Henry and Catharine, to
Francis himself, who was a widower. But the proposal was
suddenly changed by the English into one for wedding
<persName key="Mary of Burgundy">Mary of Burgundy</persName>to Francis' second son, a young boy. The French
were disgusted, but nevertheless the negotiation did not
drop. After the sack of Rome, Wolsey went on a stately
embassy to<placeName key="France">France</placeName> to arrange for this alliance.  But
Francis was so unsuccessful that the scanty prospect of
English help was no sufficient inducement for him to continue t
he struggle. When he made peace in <date value="1529">1529</date>, England
had not yet drawn the sword in his favour. Henry and his
minister had succeeded in making England almost the
third power in Europe. But that was very little to show for
years of incessant diplomacy. After all, the weakness of
England's position as a makeweight was, that her power
weighed so lightly that, even when it was thrown on to the
weaker side, it was as yet too little to turn the scale.
Despite the English change of sides, Charles remained the
master of Europe, and when it came to the point, England
did not even venture to strike a blow.  Nevertheless,
with all its futility in results, Wolsey had done no small
service to England. Under <persName key="Henry VII">Henry VII</persName>. England counted for
nothing at all. Under <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. she was again, thanks
to Wolsey, something to be reckoned with.  England
moreover had come out of her isolation and had become
an element, if not a supremely important one, in the
political system of Europe.</p><p>
10. Though the chief greatness of Wolsey lay in his
astuteness as a diplomatist, yet he made some mark as a
home minister. The grandness of some of his           <note place="foot" n="33"> The domestic policy of Wolsey,<dateRange from="1513" to="1529">1513-1529</dateRange>.</note>
schemes of domestic reformation, however
imperfectly they were carried out, stand in
pleasant contrast to the trickery and lying that defaced
every step of his foreign policy, even when he was striving
after high ends. The first few years of Henry's reign were
a period of unruffled calm. The king royally spent his
money on pomp and ostentation; and the chroniclers have
little to tell save of the pageants and revelries at court.
With the outbreak of war, the need for money began to
make itself felt, and it was well for Henry that Wolsey's
influence now became strong enough to check some of the
waste and extravagance of the early days of the reign.
Yet the Parliament of <date value="1512">1512</date> gave the large grant of
160,000, which was all that the king asked for, and peace




<pb id="p.18" n="18"/>               <note place="foot" n="34">[<date value="1517">1517</date>-.<date value="1525">1525</date>.]</note>
was renewed before financial pressure again made itself
felt. Plague and sedition alone disturbed the unbroken
quiet of the next few years. In <date value="1517">1517</date> and <date value="1528">1528</date> there were
repeated outbreaks of the sweating sickness, a strange and
deadly epidemic that singled out for its special victims the
gross, well-fed, uncleanly Englishmen of the time.  On
<note place="foot" n="35">Evil May Day,<date value="1517">1517</date>.</note>
Evil May Day, <date value="1517">1517</date>, riots broke out in
          London, when the London apprentices laid
violent hands on the foreigners dwelling in the capital.
The disturbances were thought to be too remissly put down
by the city authorities, who sympathised with the rioters'
hatred of foreigners and foreign ways.  A few victims
were hung; and four hundred of the culprits condemned
to die were paraded, with halters round their necks,
before Henry, who, amidst a scene of wild rejoicing,
pardoned them all.  But if Henry favoured the people,
like his father he feared the old nobility, and Wolsey,
now  at the height of his power, treated them with
<note place="foot" n="36">Execution ofBuckingham,<date value="1521">1521</date>. </note>
studied insolence. Edward Stafford, Duke of
  Buckingham, the son of Richard III.'s accomplice
 and victim, and a descendant of Edward
III. through Thomas of Woodstock, was the most important
representative left of the older baronial houses.
He was a foolish man, proud of his exalted rank and silly
enough to listen to lying prophets who poured into his
greedy ears stories of how the king would soon die, and
how he himself would become heir to the crown. He did
not conceal his dislike of the Cardinal, and boasted freely
of the great future revealed to himself. In April <date value="1521">1521</date>, he
was suddenly arrested, and tried as a traitor. There was
little evidence of real treason, but the king said that he was
guilty, and the peers were too timid to go against the king's
will. In May Buckingham was condemned and executed.
His vast estates were divided among the courtiers. From
that time the proudest nobles of the land were absolutely
cowed.</p><p>
11. The expenses of the war in <date value="1522">1522</date> and <date value="1523">1523</date> again
compelled Henry to summon parliament. The Commons
<note place="foot" n="37">The Parliamentof <date value="1523">1523</date>. </note>
of the period, still afraid of the old days when
           the nobles ruled as they would, were disposed
to support the king, as their best protection against overpowerful
subjects. But this state of things had now passed
by, and Henry made demands on their purses more excessive
than had ever been known. Wolsey as Chancellor
demanded a subsidy of L8oo,ooo, a vast sum for those days,



             <pb id="p.19" n="19"/>
and five times as much as the grant eleven years before which
had been thought a heavy burden. When the Commons
showed consternation at the request, the Cardinal went
down to the House in state and lectured them on their duty
of supporting the king. The speaker, Sir Thomas More,
the brilliant man of letters, who here first took a leading
position in public life, did his best to persuade the
Commons to make the grant, and finally a large sum was
voted, though not so much as Wolsey had asked for.
Never a lover of parliaments, this imperfect success led
Wolsey to manage without their help in the future. Two
years later, when the battle of Pavia suggested the wisdom
of again equipping an army and invading<placeName key="France">France</placeName> during
the king's captivity, the money necessary was obtained not
by parliamentary grant, but by what was                    <note place="foot" n="38"> The Amicable Loan, <date value="1525">1525</date>.</note>
called an Amicable Loan. This was a device
of Wolsey's, who sent commissioners to every shire to call
upon all men to pay a sixth part of their substance to support
the king's project of invading<placeName key="France">France</placeName> in person. The
Cardinal himself harangued the lord mayor and corporation
of London to induce their obedience. "The king must go
like a prince," he said, "which cannot be without your aid.
Beware, therefore, and resist not, otherwise it may fortune
to cost some their heads." Later on the citizens said that
an act of Richard III. had made benevolences illegal. "I
marvel," he answered, "that you speak of Richard, which
was a usurper and the murderer of his nephews. Of so
evil a man how can the acts be good ? " But the Londoners
still resisted, and Wolsey was fain to agree that every man
should "privily grant what he would." Nor was there less
resistance in the country. A revolt was threatened in the
eastern counties, and Wolsey feared for his life. " The poor
cursed," wrote a chronicler; "the rich repugned, the light
wits rallied: but in conclusion all people cursed the
Cardinal and his coadherents as subversers of the laws and
liberties of England." " If men should give their goods by
a commission," was the cry, "then it would be worse than
the taxes of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, and England should be bond and not
free." In the end Henry revoked the commissions. Even
the fierce Tudor had to bend before the storm, which resistance
to arbitrary taxation had excited. Wolsey, already
hated by the nobles, was henceforth hated by the Commons.</p><p>
12. Beneath the seeming calm of the time, the seeds of
revolution were being sown, and the long peace of the
strong king's reign opened up England to the new ideas of



<pb id="p.20" n="20"/>            <note place="foot" n="39">   [<date value="1509">1509</date>-<date value="1515">1515</date> ] </note>
Europe, at the very time when her statesmen were making
her a full member of the European body politic. Even in
<note place="foot" n="40">The Renascence in Italy and England. </note>
the troubled days of the Wars of the Roses
  there had been a few Englishmen inspired
  by the new learning which had radiated from
Italy all over Europe. The introduction of printing had
opened up to a wide public ideas hitherto limited to a little
circle of scholars. Men had began to ask questions and
criticise authorities. It was no longer enough to say, " It
has always been so," "It is written thus," which in earlier
times had been looked upon as sufficient answers to any
curious inquiries. Before long fruits of this new spirit were
to be seen when the great change in men's minds, which
was called the Renascence, that is the New Birth, became
fully accomplished. This movementtookmany shapes. To
some it meant the revived study of classical literature, and
especially of Greek, which had been almost unknown in
the Middle Ages, but was now again pursued with rare
devotion and enthusiasm. To others it meant something
wider than this, a new birth of the human spirit, and a fierce
revolt against the Middle Ages, with their subservience
to authority, their dogmatism, their narrowness and their
bigotry. Italy, the first home of the Renascence, became
full of the most active intellectual life. Her scholars, her
artists, her writers made her the admiration of the world,
and in the days before the invasion of <persName key="Charles VIII">Charles VIII</persName>., Italy
was the most civilised, wealthy and enlightened of European
countries. But the spirit of revolt not seldom became an
indiscriminate casting off of all control. The statesmen of
Italy mocked at morality; many of her scholars mocked
at both morality and religion. Since Italy had become the
battle ground of Europe, she had undergone a fiery trial,
which was rapidly putting an end to the domination of the
new spirit there, and the few English who went to Italy for
inspiration brought back the sacred impulse to thought
and study, rather than the excesses of the degenerate
Italians of the last age of the Renascence.</p><p>
In the days of <persName key="Henry VII">Henry VII</persName>., the new       learning in
England had its foremost champions in a little band of
<note place="foot" n="41">The Oxford Reformers.</note>
Oxford men, whose chief object was to throw
 off the trammels of the medieval schoolmen,
and set up the study of Greek and of sound classical
literature in the place of the dry logic and hide-bound
theology of the men of the old learning. Foremost among
these were William Grocyn, who first taught Greek in



                 <pb id="p.21" n="21"/>
Oxford, Thomas Linacre, Prince Arthur's tutor, famous both
as a physician and as a humanist or classical scholar, and
John Colet, who in <date value="1496">1496</date> first
lectured after the modern
fashion on the Greek Testament in Oxford, and, becoming
Dean of St. Paul's, set up, hard by the Cathedral, St. Paul's
School, as a seminary of classical learning and sound religion
(I51O). Of a somewhat younger generation were Erasmus
of Rotterdam, the most illustrious writer of his time, who
spent many years in England, and Thomas More, a judge's
son, who, to the great grief of his fellow scholars, gave up
a life of study for the bar and politics, but never lost his
love of scholarship or his zeal for the new learning. All
these men saw in their different ways that the times were
full of evil, and they were zealous to make things better.
But they were moderate men, who wished to permeate the
old forms with the new spirit, rather than build up a violent
revolution from without. Erasmus was a timid student,
who laughed at bigotry and abuses, but shrank from the
rough work of ending them. Colet, a man of
a more sturdy nature, was intensely religious,                <note place="foot" n="42"> Dean Colet.</note>
and denounced the blindness, ignorance, and worldliness
of the clergy, and strove to make men more spiritually
minded by studying the Bible in a reasonable and reverential
spirit. Yet he had no quarrel with the doctrines or
system of the Church, but only with the ignorance and
corruption which had overspread its teaching and practice
with countless abuses. More was as devout as Colet, but
he was a layman versed in affairs, and his mind turned
from religious and educational problems to
consider the general state of society. More                <note place="foot" n="43"> Sir Thomas More</note>
saw that many evils were underlying the apparent prosperity
of the times, and that England was not far distant
from an economic and social revolution. In his famous
book called Utopia, published in Latin in <date value="1515">1515</date>, More
sought to stir up men's discontent with the political and
social system in which they lived by depicting an imaginary
ideal commonwealth where everything was ordered for
the best. In Utopia there were no aggressive
wars, no religious persecutions, no indiffer-                  <note place="foot" n="44">Utopia <date value="1515">1515</date></note>
ence to things intellectual or spiritual, no violence, no
crime, no idleness, no overwork, no eager striving for
place and power, no glaring contrasts of wealth and
poverty, but all was harmonious, happy and contented.
Nor did More confine himself to dreaming dreams of an
ideal happiness.  He drew in the same book a vivid


<pb id="p.22" n="22"/>             <note place="foot" n="45">[<date value="1515">1515</date>-<date value="1527">1527</date>.]</note>
picture of the evils that beset England and suggested
powerful remedies for them. The country was overrun
with disbanded soldiers, cast-off serving-men, and other
"sturdy vagrants," unwilling to work or for whom no work
could be got. In despair they took to robbery, and, as a
cruel law punished robbery, no less than murder, with death,
they thought it safer to kill their victims as well as to
plunder them, since in any case, if they were found out, the
penalty was the same, and dead men told no tales. If the
law were less "sharp and ungentle" there would be fewer
murders. If the people had more employment there would
be fewer robbers and vagrants. But the rich landowners
had discovered that it was more profitable to breed sheep
than grow corn. In England "sheep are the devourers of
men, and sheep masters the decayers of husbandry."
Noblemen and gentlemen, for the sake of gain, leave no
ground for tillage but enclose all in pastures.  Pasture
lands require fewer labourers than corn lands, so they
"pluck down towns and villages and turn churches into
sheep folds." In short the social and economical system of
the Middle Ages was decaying, like their politics, their
learning, and their religion. As ever in revolutionary
times, the worst men came to the top. "Men speak of
the commonwealth, but every man pursueth his private
gain."</p><p>
13. <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. and Wolsey were no ardent reformers,
but they were not untouched by the spirit of the times and
<note place="foot" n="46">Wolsey's ecclesiasticalpolicy. </note>
were anxious to do something to make things
                      better, though they never seriously grappled
with the delicate and difficult task of radical reform. More
went into the king's service and Henry delighted to do
him honour. Wolsey busied himself with plans of educational
reformation, which partake of the grandeur and
nobleness of all his designs.  He saw that the Church
wanted reform, and though not stopping to amend his own
life or to go to the root of the evils, he nevertheless had
real remedies to offer. In <date value="1518">1518</date> Henry persuaded Leo X.
to make Wolsey "legate a latere," a special deputy sent
directly from the Pope's side and having in his own hands
the delegated authority of the Papacy. The strange combination
of political and ecclesiastical authority which he
now enjoyed gave him a position such as no one had ever
held in England before.  He thought that he was now
strong enough to carry out his great ideas. About <date value="1524">1524</date>
he persuaded Pope and king to allow him to dissolve



               <pb id="p.23" n="23"/>
some small poverty-stricken and corrupt monasteries, out
of whose revenues he began to establish two great
colleges, One of the two was at Oxford, and he called
it Cardinal College, and endowed it on a scale of hitherto
unknown magnificence. The other he set up at Ipswich,
his native town, to serve as a school to supply his Oxford
foundation with students. In doing this he was but treading
in the steps of earlier reformers, like William of Wykeham
and Henry VI. He saw that there were too many lazy
monks and not enough deep scholars. By his new establishments
he hoped to make the clergy better educated and
more energetic. Without any radical changes of doctrine
or organisation, he aspired to reform the Church from
within. His impulse was a wise and noble one, but it
required much more care and time than Wolsey could spare
from his other business to carry out such a policy properly.
When Wolsey fell his work of educational reformation was
only half begun.</p><p>
14. A few good men were busy with great plans for
making the world better and wiser. But the king, on
whom everything depended, was bent on satis-               <note place="foot" n="47">The early history of the Divorce Question,<dateRange from="1527" to="1529"> 1527 - 1529</dateRange></note>
fying his own selfish wishes.  It was bad
enough, as some thought, to exhaust the re-
sources of England in useless wars, and soil
her honour by lying and deceitful diplomacy. But the
worst trickery of Wolsey's statecraft was respectable beside
the idea that now took full possession of the self-willed
king. We have seen how, after <date value="1525">1525</date>, he broke from the
alliance with his wife's nephew, <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>. Besides his
fear of Charles's power, he had a stronger and more
personal motive for his change of policy. He had grown tired
of his queen, the Emperor's aunt, and in <date value="1527">1527</date> he applied
to Clement VII. for a divorce from the lady who had been
his wife for over eighteen years.</p><p>
Catharine of Aragon, the youngest child of Ferdinand
and Isabella, had come to England as a girl of sixteen to
wed the Prince Arthur. Within a few months of the
marriage the young <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName></persName> lay dead at Ludlow (<date value="1502">1502</date>),
and Catharine stayed in England, partly because she
remained a pledge of the Spanish alliance, and partly because
her return home would have been very inconvenient
to her miserly father-in-law, as her rich wedding portion
would have left England with her. Accordingly it was
proposed that she should marry her brother-in-law, the
new <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName></persName>, Henry, who was six years her



<pb id="p.24" n="24"/>                <note place="foot" n="48">[<date value="1527">1527</date>-<date value="1527">1527</date>.]</note>
junior. Such a wedding was against the law of the Church,
but dispensations were got from Rome that satisfied ever
the pious scruples of Queen Isabella, her mother. Nevertheless
the marriage was not carried out, and the young
widow remained neglected until the <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName></persName> became
<persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.  But within two months of his accession,
Henry married her. Despite the disparity of ages they
lived happily for many years, though Henry was a very
faithless husband and their dispositions were extremely
different. "The king adores her, and her Highness him,"
wrote her confessor, and Catharine threw herself with great
energy into carrying out her husband's policy, as, for
instance, in fighting the Scots in <date value="1513">1513</date>. She was a lighthaired,
plump lady of blond complexion, not handsome, but
of a "lively and gracious disposition." Though she loved
her needle and her books of devotion better than court
festivities or hunting and hawking, she was well educated,
had a decided will and character, and was devoted to her
husband. As she grew older, her health broke down and
Henry grew tired of her, especially after <date value="1522">1522</date>, when there
first appeared at court Anne Boleyn, the daughter of a
Norfolk gentleman, whose grandfather had made a fortune
as a London merchant, and who was connected with the
great noble houses both through his mother, a lady of
the Irish house of Ormonde, and by his own marriage
to the daughter of the Duke of Norfolk, the hero of
Flodden.  "Madame Anne," wrote an eyewitness, "is
not one of the handsomest women in the world. She is
of middling stature and swarthy complexion, and has
nothing but the king's great love and her eyes, which are
black and beautiful." She was bright and lively, and had
"wonderful long hair." She knew her power over the king,
and kept him at a distance. Before long Henry was madly
in love with her. He now began to pretend to have scruples
about the lawfulness of his marriage with his brother's
widow. Was it not, he argued, against the law of God, and
could even the Pope authorise the violation of the divine
commandments ? All his children by Catharine were dead,
save the Lady Mary, whom he had made in <date value="1525">1525</date> Princess
of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>. Henry persuaded himself or others that the
death of Catharine's other children was a mark of God's
displeasure; and argued, with more force, that there
was no example of a woman ruling England, and that so
long as he had no son, there was a danger lest the succession
should become uncertain, and civil war break out on



                <pb id="p.25" n="25"/>
his death. But the root of the matter was that the selfish,
self-willed king wanted to get rid of Catharine and marry
Anne. His fierce pursuit of his object was to be stopped
by no obstacles, and he worked both perseveringly and
violently in carrying out his evil purpose. Wolsey spent
hours on his knees before Henry, begging him to desist in
his purpose. The only result was that Henry began to
grow weary of his minister.</p><p>
According to the law of the Church a valid marriage
could not be broken. A divorce, in the language of the
time, meant declaring a marriage null and void from
the beginning.  But side by side with the theoretical
strictness of the marriage law, there was a practical
laxity that could hardly be exceeded; and the greedy
ecclesiastical lawyers in their corrupt church courts
showed extraordinary cleverness in inventing excuses for
annulling what seemed to be lawful wedlock. Henry's
sister Margaret had easily got divorced in a scandalous
way from her second husband, Angus, and, a little
earlier, Louis XII. had brutally put aside his first wife
with the Pope's goodwill. But Henry's application put
the Pope in peculiar difficulties.  Henry was prudent
enough not to raise the question of the power of any
Pope to dispense with the law that prohibited marriage to
a brother's widow. He only asked that Julius II.'s dispensation
should be declared invalid on the ground of
certain irregularities of form, and he did not even press a
proposal he at one time entertained of asking for a new
dispensation to commit bigamy. But since the sack of
Rome, Clement was the Emperor's creature, and for a time
his prisoner; and it was impossible for him to go against
Charles, who fiercely upheld his aunt's cause. Yet it was
hard for Clement to quarrel with Henry, especially as he
was hoping that Henry, in alliance with Francis, would save
Italy from the tyranny of the Emperor. A timid, shuffling,
cunning diplomatist, careful chiefly of his position as an
Italian prince, Clement's only course was to temporise.
By delaying as long as he could, he hoped that the march
of events would relieve the embarrassments of his position.
Wolsey, accepting the inevitable, reluctantly urged upon
Clement to comply with his master's request. He could not
believe that Henry really meant to marry the giddy, insignificant
court lady, but he hoped that, if Henry were free,
he might persuade him to strengthen still further his darling
French alliance by wedding some lady of the royal house



<pb id="p.26" n="26"/>                <note place="foot" n="49">[<date value="1527">1527</date>-<date value="1530">1530</date>.]</note>
of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>. Anxious to please everybody, Clement at last
yielded to Wolsey's importunity, and reluctantly agreed
to appoint what was called a Decretal Commission, that is,
a commission to find out whether the form of the dispensation
was as Henry had declared, it being laid down in the
document that, if this were the case, the marriage was
invalid. The Pope appointed two legates to act as his
commissioners. One was Wolsey himself, the other was
-Cardinal Campeggio, an Italian living at Rome, who, after
the evil fashion of the time, held the bishopric of Salisbury.
</p><p>Henry and Anne were overjoyed, but Wolsey was nervous
and the Pope very much alarmed, now that he had given
away the power of settling the question to others. Clement,
however, resolved that the commission should never take its
course. Campeggio did his best to delay matters. Gout and
other excuses delayed his departure from Rome, and made
his journey to England a very slow one. It was not until <date value="1529">1529</date>
that the legates opened their court at Blackfriars. Catharine,
who had firmly resisted their private advice to quietly
retire to a convent, took up a bold line before them. She
declared in her husband's presence that she had been his
faithful wife for twenty years, and had done nothing that
made her worthy to be put to public shame. She appealed
to the Pope himself, and her confessor, John Fisher, Bishop
of Rochester, the best and most learned of the bishops,
appeared before the court, and said that "to avoid the
damnation of his soul" he had come to declare that the
marriage could not be dissolved by any law human or
divine. Public opinion was strongly moved. Campeggio
still forced Wolsey to delay. The court did not open till
the end of May, and Campeggio insisted on adjourning,
after a few weeks, for the long vacation. Before it had
reassembled, the news came that the Pope had revoked the
commission and all the business had to be gone into over
again at Rome. The Emperor had forced his dependent
to throw over the English King.
</p><p>15. The baffled king's anger now fell heavily on Wolsey.
For the last few years Wolsey's relations to the king had not
<note place="foot" n="50">The Fall of Wolsey, <date value="1529">1529</date>.</note>
been so cordial as of old. He repeatedly saw
    Henry overrule his wishes and then make him
the scapegoat of the ill-success of the policy which he had
unsuccessfully opposed. In the early stages of the divorce
suit Henry had carefully kept Wolsey ignorant of the real
course of events. The nobles and people joined together
in baiting the masterful Chancellor and Henry was not



                 <pb id="p.27" n="27"/>
averse to getting a fresh spell of popularity by sacrificing
his minister. Anne Boleyn's grandfather, the old Duke of
Norfolk, had died in <date value="1524">1524</date>, but his son, the new duke, the
Surrey of the French war of <date value="1522">1522</date>, backed up the cause of
his niece, and Anne Boleyn, now established in great
state in the royal palace, looked upon Wolsey as responsible
for the failure of the legatine court. The old nobles
renewed their attacks on their ancient enemy, and now
Henry's favour was withdrawn. Wolsey was driven from
the chancellorship and his property was seized.  The
monstrous charge was brought against him of having broken
the statute of Praemunire by acting as Pope's legate, though
it was notorious that he had taken the office with the king's
goodwill.  His college at Ipswich was destroyed, and
Cardinal College confiscated by the king, who made a
great merit of refounding it on a smaller scale under the
name of Christ Church. The fallen minister made an abject
submission, and was at last allowed to leave his retreat at
Esher and go back to his diocese of York. In <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName>
he threw himself with unwonted energy into his work as
archbishop, and succeeded in winning the love of the rude
north countrymen. But he could not remain contented, and
sought to be recalled to the royal favour. He indiscreetly
entered into relations with the French and imperial ambassadors,
and this sign of discontent was interpreted as
treason.  Henry angrily ordered his arrest, and early in
November Wolsey was slowly moved southward to meet
the fate that attended those who stood across the path of
<persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. His disgrace and ill-health had undermined
his constitution. The hardships of a winter journey brought
on a severe illness, and when he reached Leicester Abbey,
he took to his bed and died (27 November <date value="1530">1530</date>). No
statesman of his rank ever left the scene less lamented.
Save for a few faithful servants, like Cromwell and his
biographer Cavendish, all the world was against him. Yet
he had laboured long and faithfully to promote the welfare
and glory of his country, and with him ended the peaceful
and prosperous days of his master's reign.

<persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. and the Beginnings of the
Reformation. <dateRange from="1529" to="1547">1529-1547</dateRange>.</head>
<p>1. One of the many signs of the break-up of the medieval
system had long been the growing weakness of the Church
<note place="foot" n="1">The Reformation on the Continent.</note>
though the Church went on, outwardly as
              strong as ever, and all the attempts of moderate
                reformers had done little to alter its spirit or
destroy the worst abuses. At last in <date value="1517">1517</date> the long-deferred
crisis came. Martin Luther, a Saxon friar, stirred up a
great agitation in Northern <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName> against the system of
indulgences, by which penances for sin were remitted in
return for money payments, and which became in practice
little better than licences purchased with money to commit
sin. Before long Luther was in open revolt against the
Papacy and the Church system of the Middle Ages. Almost
at the same time Ulrich Zwingle was starting a similar
movement among the Swiss at Zurich. The Papacy was
corrupt and careless, and Pope Leo X. thought more of
upholding the balance of power and patronising scholars
and artists, than of ending abuses or reforming the Church.
Luther denounced the popular notion of good works, and
taught that men were justified, or made righteous, by faith
and soon made his doctrine of justification by faith the
centre of a system that cut deep into the traditions of the
Church. Many German princes, especially Luther's own
lord, the Elector of Saxony, backed up the friar. The
young Emperor strove in vain to restore unity of thought to
<placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>, and in a few years all North <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName> fell away
from the Papacy. After <date value="1529">1529</date> Luther's followers were called
Protestants, because of the protest which they made against
the old Church system. Even more thorough-going was
the reformation which Zwingle made in Switzerland.
While Luther kept up the pompous ceremonies of the
ancient Church, left each church to settle whether it should
be governed by bishops after the traditional fashion or
otherwise, and strongly upheld the doctrine of the Real
Presence n the Eucharist Zwingle cleared the churches of
ornaments, set up a simple form of praying and preaching,
advocated a popular form of church government that left
little room for the priest, and taught that the Lord's
Supper was a simple commemorative feast. A few years



           <pb id="p.29" n="29"/>
later the great French thinker, John Calvin of Noyon,
pushed the new principles to their uttermost, and established
a model reformed church in the free city of Geneva,
to which he had fled for refuge when expelled from
France by Francis I.   While North <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName> and
Scandinavia received their reformation from Luther,
Calvin absorbed and made more spiritual the religion
of Zwingle, and became the chief Reformer of Middle
Europe.  Both Luther and Calvin utterly  broke with
the old Church, and set up a new system, which each
thought was more like primitive Christianity than the
Church of the Middle Ages. Great violence and disturbances
threatened to make the religious revolution a political
and social revolution as well.  Moreover, it took a long
while before men's opinions finally settled down, the spirit
of unrest was almost universal, and it seemed as if the
Catholic Church were everywhere on the verge of ruin.
Even in Italy the Popes had to fight against the spirit
of the Renascence.  Only in <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> did the faith of the
Middle Ages still live on.</p><p>
2. For many years England was but little influenced by
the Reformation movement. But the failure of the men of
the new learning to carry out a moderate                     <note place="foot" n="2">Beginnings of English Protestantism.</note>
reform of the Church from within, soon led
those who disliked abuses to wish well to
the Continental Protestants, and young scholars went to
<placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName> to study the new gospel under Martin Luther.
Yet the great mass of English opinion was strongly
conservative, and reformers, like Wolsey or More, were
as active against the audacious heretic as the most oldfashioned
opponents of all change. <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>., who
was proud of his orthodoxy and knowledge of theology,
published in <date value="1521">1521</date> a Latin book in which he defended the
seven sacraments against Luther, who said that there were
only two. Leo X. was so pleased with this that he gave
Henry the title of Defender of the Faith, which all
subsequent English kings and queens have borne. But
before the end of Wolsey's power, the new doctrines were
slowly creeping into England; and in <date value="1525">1525</date> William
Tyndale printed abroad an English version of the New
Testament, which his sympathisers privately circulated
in England. The government burnt at Paul's Cross all
copies that could be found. More engaged in bitter
controversy with the heretic. Tyndale was forced to take up
his quarters in the Netherlands, and before long not only



<pb id="p.30" n="30"/>             <note place="foot" n="3"> [<date value="1529">l529-</date>-<date value="1532">1532</date>.]</note>
his books but his followers were burnt in England. Yet
the publication of Tyndale's Testament marked the beginning
of the establishment of a Protestant party in
England, though for many years it was small, humble, and
bitterly persecuted. It became important when, not long
after Tyndale's book saw the light, Henry, impatient
with the Pope's unwillingness to give him a divorce, began
to grow unfriendly to the papal power. But the worse
Henry's relations were with Rome, the more anxious he
was to prove his orthodoxy by stamping out every vestige
of Lutheran heresy. The fall of Wolsey brought the
heretics no relief, for More, the new Chancellor, was more
intolerant than the Cardinal.</p><p>
3. It had been one of Wolsey's mistakes to ride roughshod
over public opinion.  <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. now saw that
<note place="foot" n="4">The Reformation Parliament and its Work, <dateRange from="1529" to="1536">1529-1536</dateRange></note>
he was more likely to get his own way if
  he made a show of consulting his people.
 Henceforth he took few steps without taking
           the advice of Parliament, and, in Church
matters, of the two Convocations of Canterbury and York.
But those who have looked upon Henry as simply wishing
to carry out the desires of his subjects have entirely misunderstood
his objects. He took good care to pack his
Parliaments with his servants and dependents, and dictated
rather than interpreted the public opinion, which he boasted
to have on his side. Immediately after the fall of Wolsey
he summoned a Parliament, which met on 3rd November
<date value="1529">1529</date>, and which continued to hold sessions until <date value="1536">1536</date>,
though there were few precedents for allowing a Parliament
to last so long without fresh elections. With the help of
the submissive Commons, Henry began the great revolution which was to cut England adrift from the Middle
Ages.</p><p>
Henry's first object was to get a divorce from Catharine and
to marry Anne. After the breakdown of the legatine court,
he thought his best way to obtain this was to frighten the
Pope by showing that England was unanimous in supporting
the divorce. To terrorise the clergy, who, alarmed at the
spread of heresy, might well hesitate to bring pressure on
the Pope, Henry appealed to the hatred of abuses and of
priestly domination that had already spread widely among
the laity. He allowed the Commons to attack the ecclesiastical
courts, and to pass acts limiting pluralities and
forbidding some clerical exactions (<date value="1530">1530</date>). In the same
year he strove, in the true spirit of the Middle Ages, to



         <pb id="p.31" n="31"/>
collect authoritative opinions adverse to the Pope's
contention that the Church might lawfully allow
a man to marry his
brother's widow. He consulted the universities               <note place="foot" n="5"> The Universities consulted, <date value="1530">1530</date>.</note>
of Christendom as to the validity of his
marriage; but the result helped neither Pope nor king,
and was largely the result of bribery and political pressure.
In <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>, <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, and Italy, where the Emperor
was all-powerful, the lawyers and theologians of the
universities decided that the Pope was right. In
England and<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, where Henry and his ally Francis had
the upper hand, a declaration was obtained that the Pope
was wrong. Such a lame result had no influence at all on
the course of the controversy.</p><p>
4. The fourteenth century laws against the Papacy were
still on the statute book, though they had long been a
dead letter. By the Statute of Pramunire no                   <note place="foot" n="6">The clergy accused of Pramunire,<date value="1530">1530</date>.</note>
foreign power could exercise jurisdiction in
England, and yet Wolsey had, with Henry's
goodwill, been appointed papal legate, as the easiest way
of reforming the Church. Henry now suddenly charged
the whole clergy of England with having broken the Statute
of Praemunire, by acknowledging the legatine authority of
the fallen chancellor. Technically the charge could not
be gainsaid, but Henry himself and the whole of the laity
were every bit as guilty as the clergy. However, the king
delighted in doing unjust things in a formally legal way,
and, backed up as he was by Parliament, the clergy were
helpless before him. In their despair the Convocations of
Canterbury and York offered in <date value="1531">1531</date> to purchase their
pardon by paying an enormous fine. The sum fixed was
&#x00A3;1oo,ooo for Canterbury and &#x00A3;18,000 for York-a proportion
which shows how little important was the north of
England at that time. Nor was this all. Henry refused to
grant pardon to the clergy until they had acknowledged
him as "Supreme Head of the English Church." There
was nothing in the proposed title that necessarily excluded
the papal power, or the independent rights of the English
Church, but the clergy were suspicious, and only consented
to recognise Henry's supremacy "in so far as is permitted
by the law of Christ." Thus were set up the beginnings of
the Royal Supremacy, which soon became in                  <note place="foot" n="7"> Submission of the Clergy, <date value="1532">1532</date>.</note>
Henry's hands the leading principle of the
English Reformation. It was followed up in
<date value="1532">1532</date>, when
Henry forced the Convocation of Canterbury to accept a
document called the Submission of the Clergy, in which the



<pb id="p.32" n="32"/>                     <note place="foot" n="8">[<date value="1532">l532</date>-<date value="1534">1534</date>.]</note>
Church promised never to meet in convocation or pass any
canons or Church laws without the king's consent; and
agreed that all ancient canons, that trenched upon the
royal authority, should be revised.  et despite this
submission, Parliament, in <date value="1532">1532</date>, continued its attack on clerical
privileges by limiting Benefit of Clergy in cases of felony
to clerks who were at least sub-deacons. Before this law
was passed all accused persons who "proved their clergy"
by showing that they could read were handed over by the
king's courts for trial by the Church courts which could
only impose very inadequate penalties. The rights of the
Church were made the excuse for allowing all educated
people to commit their first crime with comparative impunity.</p><p>
5. Absolutely master of his own subjects, lay and
clerical, Henry now set to work in earnest to force the
Pope to give him his divorce by a systematic series of
attacks on the papal authority. In reviving the ancient
laws he had done much in this direction, but every year
now saw a new branch of the power, which Engand had
accepted for centuries, hewn away without a scruple.</p><p>
In <date value="1532">1532</date>, at the instance of the clergy themselves, the
Annates Act was passed, which forbade bishops to pay
<note place="foot" n="9">Annates Act,<date value="1532">1532</date>.</note>
henceforth to the Pope the Annates or First- Fruits,
        that is, theirnominal first year's income

which it had been the custom, not only for bishops, but for
all clergymen newly appointed to benefices, to send to
Rome as a sort of thankoffering. This would have cut off
a great source of papal income from England, but, in order
to influence the Pope more effectually, Parliament enacted
that the law was not to come into force until the king was
so minded. Henry let the Act sleep for the present, but
Clement VII. could not be bribed to give him a divorce.
He was still so utterly at the mercy of <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>. that it
was impossible for him to disoblige the Emperor, even if
he had seen his way to repudiate the action of his predecessor,
who had permitted Henry's marriage.</p><p>
The obstinacy of the Pope and the fixed determination
of the king were still arrayed against each other, as they
had been five years before. England had gradually drifted
into revolution without any one knowing it: and the outlook
was becoming darker than ever. In <date value="1532">1532</date> Sir Thomas
More had resigned the Chancellorship in disgust and gone
into private life. Soon after, Archbishop Warham died,
and Henry put in his place Dr. Thomas Crammer, an



         <pb id="p.33" n="33"/>
almost unknown Cambridge scholar, whose chief recommendation
was that he would carry out the king's will.
Meanwhile, Henry's last hope of foreign support had
disappeared when Francis I., instead of joining him
against the Pope, had been induced by Clement to
enter into a close alliance with the Emperor, which left
England without a friend in Europe. Henry now resolved
that English courts should do what papal courts had
refused to accomplish, and early in <date value="1533">1533</date> he secretly married
Anne Boleyn. He then hurried through Parliament the
Act in Restraint of Appleals, which declared that the realm
of England was an empire containing within                   <note place="foot" n="10"> Act if Appeals and divorce ofCatharine by Cranmer, <date value="1533">1533</date>.</note>
itself both civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction
sufficient for all causes, and therefore forbade
all appeals to Rome and made the Archbishop's
Court the highest church court in England. The
Annates Act of <date value="1532">1532</date> was also enforced, and the breach
with Rome was now open.    Cranmer held a court at
Dunstable in which he declared Catharine's marriage
invalid, and his was now the highest tribunal before which
the suit could be brought. Henry now avowed his marriage
with Anne Boleyn, who was solemnly crowned queen
amidst great rejoicings and wonderful pageantry. Before
the end of the year the birth of the Lady <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>,
daughter of Henry and Anne, did something to settle the
vexed question of the succession.  In <date value="1534">1534</date> an Act of
Succession was passed, which settled the throne on the
children of Queen Anne.</p><p>
6. In <date value="1534">1534</date>, Clement gave judgment in favour of Catharine,
and died soon afterwards. Henry now drove through
Parliament an act which cut away the last
vestiges of papal jurisdiction. A new Annates                   <note place="foot" n="11">The abolition of papl power and the establishment of the Royal Supremacy, <date value="1534">1534</date>.</note>
Act was passed, which extended the principle
of the former Act to every sort of benefice,
while Tenths, that is the tenth of each year's
income after the first, which till now had also been paid to
the Pope by the beneficed clergy of all ranks, were henceforth
also kept in the king's hands. Two other anti-papal
acts followed. One abolished Peter Pence, the last remaining
revenue drawn by the Pope from England, and
transferred the Pope's claim to issue dispensations to the
Archbishop of Canterbury. The other again confirmed the
"Submission of the Clergy," and made a fresh encroachment
on the spiritual power by directing that delegates
appointed by the king should hear appeals from the court




<pb id="p.34" n="34"/>                  <note place="foot" n="12">[<date value="1531">1531</date>--<date value="1534">1534</date>.] </note>
of the archbishop  Later in the year the Act of Supremacy
was passed, by which it was made treason to deny to the
king that title of Supreme Head on earth of the Church of
England, which Convocation, in more guarded language,
had already bestowed upon him.</p><p>
Thus was the separation between England and Rome
completed. Henry boasted that he was no innovator, but
was merely carrying out to their logical results the ancient
laws, which had upheld the national independence and the
supremacy of the crown against the claims of a foreign
potentate. His contention was that the Papal Supremacy
was, in its essence, political, and might be thrown off without
any change in the ecclesiastical or religious policy of England.
The fiercer Henry grew against the Pope, the more
careful he was to emphasise his orthodoxy by burning the
followers of Luther and Zwingle. In <date value="1531">1531</date> Thomas Bilney,
a Cambridge man, who had taught in the eastern counties
justification by faith, without attacking either the Papacy
or the teaching of the Church, was burnt at Norwich,
though the king's own chaplain, Hugh Latimer, was his
friend, and eulogised "little Bilney" as "a simple, good
soul, not fit for this world." In <date value="1533">1533</date>, a more outspoken
heretic suffered the same fate. This was John Frith, a
follower of Zwingle, who denied the doctrine of the Real
Presence. But all Henry's care to show his hostility to
heresy could not prevent the breach with Rome preparing
the way for religious changes. Though Henry had precedents
for limiting the Pope's authority, they all came
from times when it was an article of absolute faith, all over
Western Christendom, that the Pope was the inspired Vicar
of Christ, the highest authority on questions of faith and
morals, and even the ultimate source of all ecclesiastical
power. It was a real religious revolution, when Henry thus
broke with a power which was an integral part of the system
of the Medieval Church. In rejecting the Papacy, Henry
was really doing for England what Luther had done for
<placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>, but while Luther repudiated the whole teaching
of the Middle Ages and set up a new faith and a new
church-system, Henry, in a more conservative spirit, sought
to reorganise the English Church on a purely national basis
without any change in its faith, its organisation, or its
worship. It was a good thing for England that Henry
would have nothing of the violent methods of Continental
reformers, and gave to the English Reformation that strong
political tendency which it always retained.  While in



          <pb id="p.35" n="35"/>
France and <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName> the Reformation broke up the
political unity of the nation, the English Reformation
increased the unity and emphasised the national character
of the English state. The firm hand of four successive
monarchs led Englishmen to pray in accordance with the
royal fashion. The strong revolutionary tendencies, which
the break-up of the old order involved, were controlled by
forces powerful enough to withstand them, though in some
ways religion suffered by the state outstepping its functions,
treating the clergy almost like state officials, and making
the people believe and worship in the ruler's way, as if it
was a part of a subject's duty to accept the king's religion.
Despite many temporary fluctuations of policy, King Henry's
"middle way" at last prevailed, and the English Church
was able to maintain its continuity with the past while
reforming itself to meet the needs of a changed present.</p><p>
7. While <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. broke the bonds of Rome, he
forged a new set of fetters for the English clergy. A series
of vigorous attacks on the immunities of the                     <note place="foot" n="13">Resistance to the Supremacy,<dateRange from="1534" to="1535">1534-1535.</dateRange></note>
English Church reduced the clergy to abject
dependence on the crown, and forced them
to resign their ancient liberties and be content with
ratifying the will of the despot, whose caprice utterly
ignored the old doctrine that the Church, like the State,
was supreme within her own sphere. As early as <date value="1529">1529</date>,
Bishop Fisher of Rochester attributed the action of
Parliament to lack of faith, and declared that to accept
the king's supreme headship would cause the clergy of
England "to be hissed out of the society of God's Holy
Catholic Church." After <date value="1532">1532</date>, he joined with Sir Thomas
More in an attitude of vain protest. The restlessness of
public opinion found an expression in the strange influence
of " the Nun of Kent," <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> Barton, a servant girl, who
became a nun at Canterbury, and whose hysterical utterances

were popularly regarded as warnings from Heaven
against the new policy of the king. More, Fisher, and
other great persons thoroughly believed in                       <note place="foot" n="14">Execution of the Nun of Kent,<date value="1534">1534</date>.</note>
her sayings, and at last she grew so formidable,
 that in <date value="1534">1534</date>
she was executed as a traitor
by Act of Attainder. On the scaffold she admitted that
"being a poor wench without learning" she had been
taught to make interested prophecies by knavish priests
who got profit to themselves from her revelations. Fisher
and More were implicated in her fall, but Fisher was let
off with a fine, and the king withdrew the charge against



<pb id="p.36" n="36"/>                 <note place="foot" n="15"> [<date value="1554">1554</date>--<date value="1535">1535</date>.] </note>
More. Before long, however, both More and Fisher were
brought before Cranmer at Lambeth and asked to take the
oath which had been drawn up after the Act of Succession
was passed. Both refused to do this, though they
were willing to swear to recognise Anne Boleyn's children
as heirs to ,the throne, since Parliament had undoubted
power to alter the succession. But the oath also required
them to declare Anne Henry's lawful wife and renounce
the Pope, which neither of them was prepared to do. Anne
Boleyn spitefully persuaded Henry not to accept the
modified submission, with which Cranmer strove to induced
the king to be contented. In April
<date value="1534">1534</date>, the bishop
and lawyer were sent to the Tower, and remained there
until their death.</p><p>
More and Fisher were not alone in their resistance.
Another conspicuous foe of the supremacy was Reginald
Pole, a young churchman, then studying at Padua, who, as
a grandson of George Duke of Clarence, brother of Edward
IV., stood very near the throne, and who now gave up the
certain prospect of high preferment in England, and remained
in exile for his faith.  In
<date value="1536">1536</date> the Pope made
him a Cardinal, and he lived henceforth in Italy where he
won a great position, and wrote bitterly against Henry's
policy.  Moreover the clergy as a body were getting
restive.  They were so discontented that Cranmer was
forced to forbid any sermons on the question of the succession,
and the spirit of dissatisfaction was particularly rife
among the monasteries, many of which, belonging to orders
<note place="foot" n="16">The Observantsand the London Carthusian.</note>
scattered all over Christendom, strongly disliked
the isolation of the English Church from
the rest of the Catholic world. Despite the
corruption of some parts of the order, the Franciscan friars
were still the most popular and influential religious teachers
of the people, and especially that section called the Friars
Observant, who had been reformed in the fifteenth century
in accordance with the strictest ideals of St. Francis. Many
of the Observants declined to take the anti-papal oath, and
Henry peremptorily suppressed all their houses.  The
monks of the London Charterhouse [the name given to
Carthusian monasteries], distinguished for the austerity
and piety of their lives, took up the same course, and
refused as a body to take the oath of succession. A new
Treasons Act was now hurried through, making it high
treason to maliciously deny to the king any of his titles,
and under this they were condemned to death.  Many



           <pb id="p.37" n="37"/>
suffered on the scaffold, while others perished even more
horribly of starvation and neglect in the foul prisons of the
time. Meanwhile Fisher had been deprived of his bishopric
and the privileges attached to it. His fate was hastened
by the rash kindness of the new Pope, Paul III., who made
him a Cardinal. He was now condemned by a jury for
having "openly declared in English that the                                           <note place="foot" n="17">Execution of Fisher and More,<date value="1535">1535</date></note>
king is not Supreme Head on earth of the
Church of England." On 22nd June <date value="1535">1535</date> he
was beheaded on Tower Hill. More's turn now came. On
6th July he suffered the same fate, showing on the scaffold
the same serene composure and ready wit that had marked
his whole life. These executions sent a thrill of honor
through Europe. But the relentless policy that spared
neither the most illustrious of the bishops nor the most
famous man of letters of the realm, showed that the king
would, at all costs, be absolute master in his kingdom.
Henceforth opposition feared to make itself heard, while
Henry was encouraged by his triumph again to lay his
heavy hand upon the Church.</p><p>
8. Thomas Cromwell was now Henry's most trusted
minister. The son of a substantial fuller at Putney, Cromwell
was by his own confession a " ruffian in
<note place="foot" n="18">Rise and character of Thomas Cromwell</note>
his young days."  Driven from  home by
some misconduct, he served as a common
soldier in the Italian wars, and afterwards settled down
at Antwerp, where he amassed money by trade. He returned
to England a prosperous man, and soon became conspicuous
as a money-lender, and afterwards as a lawyer, in which
capacity he became Wolsey's legal agent and secretary.
He was one of Wolsey's instruments in suppressing a
number of small monasteries, from the revenues of which
the cardinal proposed to endow his colleges at Ipswich and
Oxford, and in <date value="1529">1529</date> sat in the House of Commons where
he courageously pleaded his fallen patron's cause. But
he soon transferred his services to the king, and rose high
in favour. A strong, resolute, greedy self-seeker, his avowed
principle of conduct was to follow the inclination of his
master. He studied Machiavelli's famous Prince when it
was still in manuscript, and brought to politics all the ability
and all the moral degradation of the worst type of Italian
statesmen. His unscrupulous strength and cunning were just
what Henry wanted. Though never becoming, like Wolsey,
the king's trusted minister, he was used to the uttermost as a
clever tool, who alone could give full effect to the autocrat's

imperious wishes. In <date value="1535">1535</date> he was appointed the king's
Vicar-general in matters ecclesiastical. This post enabled
him to wield all the vast authority that Henry now exercised
as Head of the Church. Between <date value="1535">1535</date> and <date value="1539">1539</date>, Cromwell
carried out a revolution, compared with which the abolition
of the papal power seemed a small matter, and made Henry
more of a despot than any English king had been since
Magna Carta.</p><p>
9. The eyes of the king and his vicar were now turned
upon the monasteries, whose wealth excited their greed,
<note place="foot" n="20">The SuppressionoftheSmallerMonasteries, <date value="1536">1536</date></note>
and whose powerlessness rendered them an
easy prey. The palmy days of the monasteries
had long passed away. Since the fourteenth
century very few new houses of religion
had been founded, and Wolsey and others had abolished
monasteries without a thought of bringing about any great
revolution.  The spirit of medieval piety, of which the
monastic life, with its rigid asceticism and spirit of selfrenunciation,
was the finest flower, had long been withering.
In some houses gross corruption reigned, in many more a
spirit of deadness and cold formality. While some convents
suffered from the evils of excessive wealth, a larger
number were so poor, that they could neither pay their way
nor live according to their rule. Few " regulars " made any
mark in the world of learning, or climbed high up the
ladder of ecclesiastical preferment to the great posts of
the Church, which were now almost monopolised by the
"secular" clergy. Public opinion viewed monks and friars
with indifference, and so few wished to "enter religion"
that the number of monks, even in the richest houses was
small. But it is quite clear that they were neither hated
nor feared. Despite occasional scandals and much laxity,
the monks of the greater monasteries were easy landlords,
suffering their tenants to live on quietly, paying the customary rent,
and farming after the ancient fashion. In the
remoter parts of the country they still played an indispensable part,
and everywhere they were the guardians of hallowed shrines
that the people still reverenced. The brethren
of the London Charterhouse had shown that English monks
could die nobly for their faith, and the friars were still largely
the teachers of the people. But the monks, in proportion
as they were active and zealous, were pledged to uphold
the ways of the Middle Ages. Their membership of worldwide
orders made them the least national part of the Church,
and the best monasteries were standing papal garrisons,



       <pb id="p.39" n="39"/>
who watched with fear and trembling the audacious policy
of the king, though their timidity seldom allowed them to
express their feeling as the noble Carthusians had done.
In throwing off allegiance to the Papacy, Henry almost
pledged himself to the abolition of the monasteries. The
State needed money badly: so many abbeys and priories
were no longer any use; many abuses wanted reforming. It
was easy to put forward many specious pretexts to cloak
the greediness that really set the spoilers to work.
</p><p>In <date value="1535">1535</date> Cromwell ordered a royal visitation of the
monasteries to inquire into their condition, and his brutal
underlings, such as Legh and Layton, went over the
country to trump up a case that might justify their suppression.
There was plenty of evidence that could be
used against the monks, but the visitors in their haste did
not concern themselves overmuch with sifting the true from
the false. In <date value="1536">1536</date> Parliament,
on their report, passed an
act abolishing all monasteries possessing a revenue of
less than L200 a year, it being believed that the lesser
monasteries were the more corrupt. The same commissioners
again went round to carry out the suppression,
scattering the inmates, devastating their houses, and destroying
their churches. Plain men, who knew little about
the Divorce Question or the Royal Supremacy, realised
for the first time that they were in the midst of a religious
revolution, when the churches in which they had worshipped
were rudely desecrated, their good-humoured landlords sent
away to beg their bread or live on miserable pensions, while
greedy courtiers rioted in the ancient abodes of religion,
raised the rents of their tenants, and stopped the doles and
alms that had flowed from the monasteries to the poor.
 </p><p>10. Before <date value="1536">1536</date> was out,
 two formidable popular revolts
showed that the more remote parts of England bitterly
resented the suppression of the lesser monasteries
<note place="foot" n="21">The Pilgrimageof Grace, <date value="1536">1536</date>.</note>
 by the upstarts who were leading King
Henry into strange new ways. The first rebellion
broke out in Lincolnshire, where it was soon suppressed,
but a much more formidable rising followed immediately
afterwards in <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName>, headed by the brave and simpleminded
Robert Aske, a gentleman of good family. The
country people rose in large numbers,took Pontefract Castle,
and marched south to Doncaster. The greatest nobles of
the north, with Sir Thomas Percy, brother and heir of the
Earl of Northumberland, and Archbishop Lee of York at
their head, joined them, and they resolved "to go to



<pb id="p.40" n="40"/>                <note place="foot" n="22">  [<date value="1536">1536</date>--<date value="1540">1540</date>.]</note>
London on pilgrimage to the King's Highness, and there
to have all the vile blood of his Council put from him,
and all the noble blood set there again, and also the faith
of Christ and His laws to be kept, and full restitution
to the Church of all wrongs done unto it."  For this
reason the revolt was called the Pilgrimage of Grace;
and the rebels bore before'them the banner of St. Cuthbert,
the famous northern saint, and also a standard on which
were embroidered a chalice and the mystic Five Wounds
of Christ. Norfolk, sent with a large force to crush the
rising, did not venture to cross the swollen Don or fight a
battle, but he cleverly contrived to persuade the rebels to
go home peaceably, the king promising that a general
pardon should be granted, and that a Parliament should
meet at York to remedy the grievances of the north country.
Many of the leaders, who had been constrained by fear to
join the revolt, welcomed this easy settlement. But in <date value="1537">1537</date>
new disturbances broke out, and Henry took advantage of
these to repudiate his promises. The leaders were sought
out and executed, and many of the lesser folk shared their
fate. Aske and Percy were among those who suffered,
but the archbishop, who had acted under constraint and
soon deserted the rebels, was allowed to continue in his
office. The most permanent result of the rebellion was the
setting up, on the model of the Council of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> at Ludlow,
(see chapter viii.), a law court at York called the Council
of the North, which, at some loss of liberty, did great
good by sternly suppressing riot and upholding peace and
order in the wild regions beyond the Humber, that had
long known little other law than the rule of the stronger.
</p><p>11. The spoils of the lesser monasteries stimulated Henry
and Cromwell to lay their hands upon the greater houses.
<note place="foot" n="23">The suppressionof the Greater Monasteries, <dateRange from="1537" to="1540"> 1537-1540</dateRange></note>
This time, however, they went to work in a
different way. Instead of abolishing them all
by a single law, they dealt with them individually.
Strong pressure was brought to bear
on the different communities to make so-called voluntary
surrenders to the king. Fat pensions and high church
preferment were given to complaisant abbots, and charges
were easily trumped up against the unyielding ones, that a
good case might be made for the violent suppression of
their houses. At first very few houses surrendered ; but,
in <date value="1538">1538</date>, the number mounted up to twenty-four ; and, in <date value="1539">1539</date>,
nearly two hundred abandoned the hopeless struggle. In
that year an Act of Parliament was passed confirming the



          <pb id="p.41" n="41"/>
surrenders, and giving the king power to suppress such
houses as remained, and also to deal in the same way with
colleges and hospitals that were not monastic foundations.
Before the end of <date value="1540">1540</date> there was not a monastery left in
England, and many "secular" (i.e. non-monastic) colleges
had incurred the same fate. Some of the stronger monasteries
held out nobly, but ruthless cruelty completed the
process when cajolery and fraud proved of no effect. The
execution of Abbot Whiting of Glastonbury, an infirm old
man of blameless character, hung on Glastonbury Tor on
such charges as stealing the monastery plate, because he had
sought to hide it from the greed of the commissioners, was
an act well-timed to frighten the boldest. The same scenes
that attended the destruction of the smaller houses were now
witnessed on a larger scale. The mass of the spoils fell
into the hands of courtiers or speculators, and the ring of
new nobles, who had earned their promotion by their subservience
to Henry's caprices, received from the monastic
lands an endowment for their new state. Suffolk, the king's
brother-in-law, and Cromwell himself, were                      <note place="foot" n="24">The endowmentof the New Nobility.</note>
among the chief gainers; and to this day
many famous abbeys, like Woburn and
Tavistock, remain the homes of the new families, like the
Russells, afterwards Earls of Bedford, who first came into
importance at this period. Only a small portion of the
spoil stuck in the king's hands; and before he died Henry
was as poor as ever he had been. A still smaller share
of the monks' property went to public purposes, such as
furthering Henry's wise schemes for reorganising the royal
navy and defending the coasts. There was great talk of
utilising the abbey spoils to carry out a great scheme of
church extension, but the plan that was actually effected was
a very modest one.  Six new bishoprics were set up, at
Chester, Gloucester, Bristol, Peterborough, <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>,
and Oxford; and the great monastery churches at those
towns were utilised as their cathedrals. Most of the old
cathedrals served by monks, such as Canterbury, were
similarly refounded as secular colleges with a dean and
chapter, and became known as the cathedrals of the new
foundation. The removal of the mitred abbots from the
House of Lords gave the lay peers a majority for the first
time, and made it still easier to carry measures for spoiling
the Church through Parliament.</p><p>
12. The suppression of the monasteries brought home to
all that a great religious revolution was in progress. Side



<pb id="p.42" n="42"/>                      <note place="foot" n="25">[<date value="1536">1536</date>--<date value="1539">1539</date>.] </note>
by side with it went other changes that made this still more
clear. The number of Church holidays was cut down.

<note place="foot" n="26">Other religious changes,<dateRange from="1536" to="1539">1536-1539</dateRange>.</note>

The shrines of the English saints were laid
 low, and the most famous of them all, Saint
Thomas of Canterbury, was declared a traitor,
and degraded from the honour of sanctity, because he
had ventured to oppose a king. Many images and relics
were destroyed, and great pains were taken to show by what
gross frauds the keepers of some of these images had persuaded
the simple people that they worked miracles.
Though there were not many Protestants in England, there
were plenty of enemies of the priests, who vied with the
Protestants in the violence with which they made mock of
the popular faith; and Henry, though still professing strict
orthodoxy, now gave bishoprics to men whose opinions
would have brought them to the stake a few years before.
The best of these was Bilney's staunch old friend, Hugh
Latimer, a Leicestershire yeoman's son, and the most
earnest and honest preacher of righteousness of the age,
who became bishop of Worcester. Cranmer, the archbishop,
married a German lady, whom he kept so much in
the background that it was believed that he carried her
about hidden in a chest perforated with air-holes to let her
breathe. Another sign of the times was in the permission
given, in <date value="1536">1536</date>, to allow the circulation of an English version
of the whole Bible, which Miles Coverdale had finished in
the previous year, basing his translation of the New Testament
on the proscribed rendering of Tyndale. Yet in the
same year, <date value="1536">1536</date>, Tyndale was put to death by the orders
of <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>., and at the instance of Henry himself. Other
versions of the English Bible appeared, and in <date value="1540">1540</date> it was
ordered that every parish church should possess a copy of
the Great Bible, a translation issued by Cranmer, that every
man might read it.</p><p>
13. The king's attacks on the Church had greatly stimulated
the prevalent spirit of unrest, and, despite his
<note place="foot" n="27">Limits to the changes. The Ten Articles,<date value="1536">1536</date>, and the Bishops' Book, <date value="1537">1537</date>. </note>
anxiety not to change doctrines, the clergy
   complained bitterly of the spread of heresy
  and ribald opinion. To show that he had no
  sympathy with such novelties, Henry issued,
  in <date value="1536">1536</date>, Ten Articles drawn up by Convocation,
  in which the ancient doctrines were emphasised.
But even here the spirit of change made itself felt. Of the
seven sacraments that Henry himself had defended against
Luther, only three were explained-Baptism, the Eucharist,



        <pb id="p.43" n="43"/>
and Penance. The other four were quietly ignored. The
old faith was not so much simply upheld, as explained or
apologised for. The same tendency towards moderate doctrinal
reformation appeared in the little treatise called The
Institution of a Christian Man, or the Bishops' Book, which
was drawn up in <date value="1537">1537</date> by the bishops as a popular manual
of faith and devotion.</p><p>
14. Many Englishmen looked askance on Henry's
changes, while a few lamented that the king still adhered
to so much of what they had rejected. Yet
to be a Papist was to incur the hideous                   <note place="foot" n="28">The victims ofHenry's policy,<dateRange from="1536" to="1541">1536-1541</dateRange>.</note>

punishment of a traitor, while open heresy led
directly to the stake. The Sacramentaries,
who denied the Real Presence, were in particular looked
upon as outside all hope of mercy. Conspicuous among
these was John Lambert, a Cambridge man, and an old
friend of Bilney, who was condemned in <date value="1538">1538</date> by Cranmer
for holding Zwinglian ideas about the Eucharist. Lambert,
under the new Act, appealed to the king, who heard the
case in person, and amused himself by showing off his
theological knowledge for five consecutive hours. A few
days later Lambert was burnt at Smithfield. The net for
heretics was now widely spread. In the same year John
Forest, an Observant friar, who had once been Queen
Catharine's confessor, was burnt as a heretic for denying
the royal supremacy, though the more usual course would
have been to condemn him as a traitor. He was cruelly
tortured by being slung over a fire, the faggots for which
were got by chopping up a wonder-working Welsh image,
which had been brought to London by the king's orders.
As friends of old ways grew restless under the tyranny,
stern examples were used to put down disaffection. Henry
Courtenay, Marquis of Exeter, the king's first cousin and
a grandson of <persName key="Edward IV">Edward IV</persName>., was executed in <date value="1538">1538</date> on a charge
of conspiracy, along with some of the kinsfolk of Cardinal
Pole, who was working hard on the Continent to excite
public opinion against Henry's ecclesiastical policy. In
<date value="1541">1541</date> Pole's aged mother, Margaret, Countess of Salisbury,
was also put to death, her real crime being that she was a
daughter of George, Duke of Clarence, and the mother of
the audacious cardinal.</p><p>
15. With all his violence, <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. was honest in
professing to uphold the ancient faith. He                     <note place="foot" n="29">The Six Articlesstatute, <date value="1539">1539</date>.</note>
had a keen eye for the signs of the times,  and
the increasing strength of the opposition perhaps taught him



<pb id="p.44" n="44"/>                <note place="foot" n="30"> [<date value="1539">1539</date>--<date value="1540">1540</date>.]</note>
that there had been changes enough for the present. The
new Parliament that met in  539, and abolished the Greater
Monasteries, was utterly subservient to his wishes, surrendering
in his favour the supreme privilege of Parliament
to make fresh laws, by the strange statute that gave the
king's proclamations the force of law, and thus virtually
transferred to the king the legislative power. But the same
Parliament also passed the Six Articles Statute, which
declared with no uncertain voice that the English Church
had no sympathy with the doctrines of the Reformation.</p><p>
<quote rend="blockquote">By this law six important points of mediaeval doctrine were
strongly upheld. These affirmed (1) The Real Presence of the Body
and Blood of Christ in the Eucharist, and the Transubstantiation, or
change of substance, of the bread and wine into Christ's natural Body
and Blood. (2) The sufficiency of communion in one kind. (3) That
the clergy might not marry. (4) That vows of chastity (taken by
monks and nuns) were binding throughout life. (5) That private
masses ought to be carried on. (6) That auricular (private) confession
ought to be retained. The penalty of denying the first article
was death by burning as a heretic. Those who spoke against the
other five forfeited their property on the first offence, and for a second
were to be hung as felons. The Protestants called the statute "The
Whip with Six Strings."</quote></p><p>
The new law was no dead letter. Cranmer was forced
to put away his wife, and two bishops, one of whom was
Hugh Latimer of Worcester, resigned their sees. Many
were imprisoned, and a few executed under the Act. With
the Six Articles the reforming period of Henry's reign
ends.</p><p>
16. During the years of religious changes, the private
life of the king had been marked by strange misfortunes.
<note place="foot" n="31">The king's domestic trouble's,<dateRange from="1533" to="1549">1533-1549</dateRange>  </note>
His marriage with Anne Boleyn did not long
remain a happy one. He was bitterly disappointed
that her only child was a daughter,
and soon grew weary of her light and giddy ways. Early
in <date value="1536">1536</date> Catharine of Aragon died, worn out before her
time by her relentless persecutors. Within a few months
her successor was suddenly arrested on charges of immorality
so monstrous and loathsome as hardly to be
believed, even in the corrupt atmosphere of Henry's court.
However that be, she was condemned by a commission of
peers, her own uncle Norfolk pronouncing the sentence of
death against her. On 17th May the complaisant Cranmer
pronounced her marriage with the king invalid, on grounds
more trumpery than those that had brought her to the



         <pb id="p.45" n="45"/>
block. The little Lady <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, like her elder sister
Mary, was declared illegitimate. Two days later Queen
Anne's head was cut off on Tower Green.                 <note place="foot" n="32"> Execution of Anne Boleyn Jane Seymour <date value="1536">1536</date>.</note>
The very next day Henry married his third
wife, Jane Seymour, one of her ladies-in-waiting,
the daughter of a simple Wiltshire
knight, and described as of "middle stature, no great
beauty, and pale complexion." Queen Jane died in <date value="1537">1537</date>,
soon after having given birth to a son, the future Edward
VI., the male heir for whom Henry had so long been
yearning. She was the only one of Henry's wives for
whom he wore mourning, but personally she had but little
influence. Yet her brothers, Edward and Thomas Seymour,
rose through the king's favour to great positions.</p><p>
17. For three years Henry remained a widower, though
several fresh matches were projected for him.  At last
Cromwell succeeded in persuading the king                  <note place="foot" n="33"> The Lutheran allianceand Anne of Ceves,<dateRange from="1539" to="1540">1539-1540</dateRange></note>
to accept his scheme of a politic marriage to
connect England with the German Lutherans.
Since the treachery of Francis I. had abruptly
broken up the French alliance in
<date value="1533">1533</date>, England had been
utterly isolated from continental politics, and, as from time
to time Charles and Francis became friendly, a common
attack on England was seriously threatened.  At that
moment the Emperor and King of<placeName key="France">France</placeName> were on good
terms, and Cromwell urged strongly that an alliance with
Charles's enemies, the German Protestants, was the best
way of neutralising the ill-will of the nephew of Catharine
of Aragon. Among the more moderate princes of reforming tendencies,
none were more influential than the Duke
of Cleves, the lord of four rich duchies on the lower Rhine
from which he might attack the Emperor's Netherlandish
dominions. One of his sisters was the wife of the Elector
of Saxony, Luther's chief patron : another, Anne, was still
unmarried, and on her Cromwell now fixed his eyes. The
famous painter Holbein sent a flattering picture of the lady,
and Henry agreed to marry her and to make a league
with the Lutherans. Despite the Six Articles, it seemed
as if the iron resolution of Cromwell were likely to make
England Lutheran after all.</p><p>
In the first days of <date value="1540">1540</date> Henry was married to Anne of
Cleves, but he found to his disgust that she was coarse,
ugly, and illiterate, and disliked her strongly from the very
first. Meanwhile the treaty with the Lutherans broke
down, and Henry found that there was not even a politic



<pb id="p.46" n="46"/>               <note place="foot" n="34"> [<date value="1540">1540</date>--<date value="1542">1542</date>.]</note>
reason for wearing his chains quietly. In April Cromwell
was apparently in high favour, and made <persName key="Earl of Essex">Earl of <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName></persName>.
But his enemies, the men of the old learning, were active
against him, and the failure of the marriage gave them
<note place="foot" n="35">Fall of Cromwell,and Henry's marriage with Catharine Howard, <date value="1540">1540</date>. </note>
the kings ear. The full force of Henry's
  wrath then fell on Cromwell, and he struck
              him down with the suddenness with which a
lion pounces on his prey. In May <date value="1540">1540</date> Cromwell
was charged with treason by his arch-enemy, Norfolk.
Arrested at the council board, he was hurried to the Tower,
and a Bill of Attainder was rapidly passed by the subservient
Parliament. The charges of treason were ridiculous,
for he had laboured for Henry only too well.  But he
had now served his master's purpose and was ruthlessly
sacrificed by the tyrant whose purse he had filled. On 28th
July he died on Tower Hill, protesting that he was no
heretic. A few weeks before this, Convocation had declared
the king's marriage with Anne of Cleves invalid, on
the ground that the lady had previously been contracted
to some one else. On the same day that Cromwell died,
Henry married his fifth wife, Catharine Howard, a poor
niece of the Duke of Norfolk, and daughter of the Lord
Edmund Howard, who had fought at Flodden.</p><p>
18. The reaction against the religious changes, which
began with the passing of the Six Articles, was further
<note place="foot" n="36">The Reactionary	Period,<dateRange from="1540" to="1547">1540-1547</dateRange>.	</note>
confirmed by the fall of Cromwell. Henceforth
  the "men of the new learning" lost
influence with the king, and needed all their shrewdness
to keep their heads on their shoulders. Cranmer, Cromwell's
ally, bent before the storm, sent his wife to <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>,
and allowed the "men of the old learning" to
determine the king's policy. The chief of this party among
the lay lords was Norfolk himself, whose simple faith was
well expressed in his saying, "It was merry in England
before the new learning came up." His chief allies were
Stephen Gardiner-, Bishop of Winchester, and Edmund
Bonner, Bishop of London. Gardiner was a learned
canon lawyer and a shrewd but cold and hard statesman.
Bonner was a vigorous and good natured but coarse
and brutal man. Both had won their promotion by upholding
the Royal Supremacy, but were resolutely set
against the tendency towards Protestantism which Cromwell
and Cranmer had latterly favoured.</p><p>
The religious reaction was shown not so much by undoing
what had been done already as by an unwillingness



                <pb id="p.47" n="47"/>
to make further changes.     The fires at Smithfield burnt
more fiercely than ever.   Among the first of the victims
was Dr. Robert Barnes, Cromwell's agent in <date value="1539">1539</date> for conducting
the negotiations with the German princes, who was
attainted and burnt in <date value="1540">1540</date> for preaching Lutheran doctrines.
Among    the   last was Anne Askew, a learned
Lincolnshire lady, burnt in <date value="1546">1546</date> under the Six Articles
Statute for denying transubstantiation.</p><p>
In <date value="1543">1543</date> a curious law was passed that none but gentlemen
should be allowed to read the Bibles that still lay
open in every church, and Gardiner strove hard, though to
no purpose, to get rid of the English Bibles altogether. In
the same year the Bishops' Book was re-edited by the king
himself, and made to agree much more closely with the
traditional teaching of the Middle Ages.    In its new form
it was called the   Necessary Erudition for any Christian
Man, or the King's Book.       These measures mark the
extent of the reaction.</p><p>
19. The spirit of reaction extended from home to foreign politics,
where the old system of traditional alliances, that had prevailed during
the king's youth, was restored by the men who had
stayed the reformation of the Church. Even in the                          <note place="foot" n="37">ForeignPolitic<dateRange from="1542" to="1547">1542-1547</dateRange></note>
wild days of Cromwell's changes Henry had had a
great deal of trouble from his nephew, James V. of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, who, as
he grew up, became jealous of his uncle's power, and between <date value="1532">1532</date>
and <date value="1534">1534</date> waged war against him. After peace had been patched up,
James continued to be a troublesome neighbour, though his plans for
breaking down the influence of the all-powerful Scots nobles, with
the help of clergy and people, diverted his mind for the time from
English affairs. He easily won over the people to his side, and his
popular manners and real friendship for the poor gave him the nickname
of " King of the Commons." He could, however, only get the
support of the clergy and their leader, David Beaton, Archbishop
of St. Andrews and Cardinal, at the price of severely putting down
the reformers, who were beginning to make headway in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>.
Moreover Beaton, who was more of a statesman than an ecclesiastic,
was a strong advocate of the French alliance. His influence prevailed
in both directions. James definitely made himself the champion of
the old faith against Henry, receiving in <date value="1537">1537</date> a consecrated cap and
sword from the Pope.   In <date value="1538">1538</date> he married King Francis' eldest
daughter, and was henceforth heart and soul on the side of the French.
Though his first wife soon died, he found another French consort
in Mary of Guise, sister of Francis, Duke of Guise, a member of a
younger branch of the ducal house of Lorraine, and an ardent Catholic,
who won a great reputation as a soldier in the service of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>.
<placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> and England were soon once more at war.
In <date value="1542">1542</date> Henry retaliated for a severe border raid by
<note place="foot" n="38">Soway Moss<date value="1542">1542</date></note>
sending Norfolk to waste the Lothians.  The Scottish nobles,
indignant at James's policy, refused to fight, but the



<pb id="p.48" n="48"/>               <note place="foot" n="39">[<date value="1542">1542</date>--<date value="1545">1545</date>.]</note>
king resolved that, even without their help, he would answer invasion
by invasion. November was already far advanced when his favourite,
Oliver Sinclair, entered Cumberland with ten thousand men, while
the king, sick in body and weak in mind, waited at Border castles to
hear the result.  But the nobles hated and despised the favourite,
and fought with so little heart that the expedition was disgracefully
defeated at Solway Moss. James took to his bed, overpowered by
melancholy and misfortune. On 8th December Mary of Guise gave
birth to a daughter, but the news brought him no consolation, but
rather a foreboding of the extinction of the house of Stewart. " It
will end as it began," lie murmured. " It came with a lass and will
go with a lass." Six days afterwards he died, and his little daughter
became Mary, Queen of Scots.</p><p>
The Earl of Arran acted as regent for the baby queen, and renewed
the negotiations with England. In <date value="1543">1543</date> it was agreed that Edward,
<persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName></persName>, should be married to the Queen of Scots. Cardinal
Beaton soon succeeded in breaking up the understanding with England.
He won over the weak Arran to his side, and cruelly persecuted
the reformers, who were the best friends of the English alliance. The
old treaties with<placeName key="France">France</placeName> were renewed, and Henry, who was now at
war with Trance, had to face an attack from <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> after the ancient
fashion. But the Scots were too much divided to be able to fight with
success, and in <date value="1544">1544</date> Henry's brother-in-law, Edward Seymour, now
Earl of Hertford, cruelly devastated south-eastern <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> and burnt
Edinburgh.
20. About the time of the ren</p><p>ewal of war between James V. and
England, Francis of<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and the Emperor Charles, after several
<note place="foot" n="40">War with<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, <dateRange from="1543" to="1546">1543-1546.</dateRange> </note>
years of friendship, again went to war against each
   other.  England and<placeName key="France">France</placeName> were on very bad terms
          already and Henry bitterly resented Francis' treachery
since <date value="1533">1533</date>,and was no less irritated at his close friendship with the
Scots. Accordingly he very willingly accepted the advances of
Charles, who, now that his aunt was dead and forgotten, was
very anxious to have England on his side again. In <date value="1543">1543</date> things
went back to the state in which they had been over twenty years
before, and Henry, in alliance with Charles, was again waging war
against the French. In <date value="1544">1544</date> a joint expedition was planned that was
to march from Calais and the German frontier to Paris. The English
fought well, and took Boulogne after a long siege. But a few days
later they heard that Charles, despairing of reaching Paris, had suddenly
concluded the treaty of Crepy with Francis, thus leaving England
to fight French and Scots single-handed. In <date value="1545">1545</date> the French sought
to avenge the loss of Boulogne by launching a great fleet and army
against the south coast of England. The invasion proved an utter
failure, and in <date value="1546">1546</date> the French were glad to make peace, leaving
Henry in possession of Boulogne.</p><p>
<placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> was included in the treaty. Since the destruction of Edinburgh
in <date value="1544">1544</date>, she had experienced nothing but misfortune. In <date value="1545">1545</date>
the Scots endured another ruthless foray led by Hertford, and in <date value="1546">1546</date>,
Cardinal Beaton, the soul of the resistance to England, was murdered
by the Scots reformers, with Henry's good-will. The murderers held
the castle of St. Andrews, which thus became an open gate by which
Henry could penetrate into <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. Under such circumstances the



            <pb id="p.49" n="49"/>
Scots gladly made peace. But the violence and brutality of the
method of Henry's Scottish policy had defeated the wise end which he
had in view. It was useless to profess to wish to join the English'and
Scottish crowns by marriage, when cruelly plundering and burning
Scottish territory and conniving at the murder of the chief Scottish
statesman. We shall see later that Henry had more success in carrying
out a similar policy of union in <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> and <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>. (See chapter
viii.)</p><p>
21. Despite the successes won abroad, the last years of
Henry's reign were filled with darkness and gloom. In
<date value="1542">1542</date> Catharine Howard incurred the fate of                 <note place="foot" n="41"> Execution ofCatharineHoward,<date value="1542">1542</date>.</note>
Anne Boleyn, being executed for misconduct
which was clearly brought home to her.
The shameful death of a second royal niece of Norfolk
did something to sap his power, especially as his harshness and
bad temper made him no very popular leader of
a party. In <date value="1543">1543</date> the king married his sixth wife, Catharine
Parr, the lively young widow of Lord Latimer, who
did not concern herself overmuch with politics, though she
leant to the reforming side. She had the good luck to outlive
her husband.</p><p>
The wave of reaction was now gradually stayed, and
signs were soon apparent that the reforming party was
gradually winning back power. Even in the                      <note place="foot" n="42"> Beginnings of a new wave of Reformation,<dateRange from="1543" to="1547">1543-1547</dateRange>.</note>
most reactionary days, a committee had been
appointed to draw up an English form
Divine Service, in which Cranmer at last found
a more congenial work than politics, which gave full scope
for his wonderful skill in turning the time-hallowed Latin
prayers into pure and expressive English. In <date value="1544">1544</date> he
issued an English Litany, translated from the early Latin
Litanies, and along with it was published a Primer, or
book of private devotions, also in English; while it was
ordered that some parts of public worship, including the
Creed, Commandments, and Lord's Prayer, should be
recited in the vulgar tongue. A strong motive for inducing
the greedy king to support fresh measures for the reformation
of the Church was to be found in the need for money
that resulted from the expensive wars of the end of the
reign. Even a gross debasement of the coinage, though it
upset the course of trade, could not restore the king's
finances. An easier way of making both ends meet was
a new attack on Church property.    In <date value="1545">1545</date> an Act of
Parliament was passed giving the king power to dissolve
colleges, chantries, and free chapels at his pleasure. Even








<pb id="p.50" n="50"/>           <note place="foot" n="43"> [<date value="1546">1546</date>--<date value="1547">1547</date>.] </note>

before the Act many nobles had laid their hands on such
establishments, and now the king seized the booty that
otherwise might have escaped his clutches. Fresh scenes
of spoliation were witnessed; and the chantries, the foundations
where private masses for the repose of the founders'
souls were said, were ruthlessly rooted out, though the
unrepealed Six Articles still upheld private masses.</p><p>
  22. Two soldiers, who had won glory in the last wars,
now directed the party of the new learning. These were
the king's brother-in-law, Edward Seymour, since <date value="1537">1537</date>
Earl of Hertford, and John Dudley, since <date value="1542">1542</date> Lord Lisle,
the son of <persName key="Henry VII">Henry VII</persName>.'s extortioner, while behind them
stood Cranmer, now drifting more and more towards the
reforming cause, though not daring to express his opinions.
Meanwhile the old king's health was breaking up.  He
<note place="foot" n="44">The Struggle of the Seymours and Howards, <date value="1546">1546</date>. </note>
could neither walk nor stand, and at last got
                                   so weak that to save him the fatigue of writing
           his name, a stamp had to be used to represent
           the royal signet. The contest between parties in the
Council became the fiercer now that the personal influence
of the king grew less, and the prize of victory was the
future direction of his young son's government. The great
fight was between the Howards and the Seymours. The
Howards despised Hertford as an upstart and a heretic,
and, thinking power was within their grasp, gave an opportunity
to their watchful enemies.  Norfolk's son, Henry
Howard Earl of Surrey, the famous poet, challenged the
king's anger by quartering the so-called arms of Edward
the Confessor with his own, and was promptly accused
of aiming at the Crown. He was quickly convicted of
treason, and was executed on 27th January <date value="1547">1547</date>. Norfolk,
who had shared his son's arrest, pleaded guilty, in the vain
hope of obtaining mercy.  But an Act of Attainder was
<note place="foot" n="45">Death of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>., <date value="1547">1547</date>. </note>
passed against him on the day of Surrey's
              execution. Next day, 28th January, Henry
himself died, before he could give the royal assent to the
legislative condemnation of his last victim.
 </p><p> 23. <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. was one of the strongest of English
kings, and with all his unbridled self-will had done a great
work for England, though he had done it in an utterly
brutal, reckless, and violent way. Would his work last
<note place="foot" n="46"><persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s plan for the Succession.</note>
after his death?  Anxious that the government
should be still carried on in his own
fashion, and wishful to provide for the
continuance of his house, Henry had got from his subservient







        <pb id="p.51" n="51"/>

Parliament permission to regulate the succession by will,
and before his death had drawn up, somewhat irregularly, a
scheme for the future settlement of the crown. In the first
place, he provided for the succession of Edward, Prince of
<placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>, the undoubted heir, and, in case Edward should
become king before he grew up to manhood, Henry
devised a council of regency, in which the two parties of the
old and the new learning were so balanced that neither
could crush the other. The real difficulty was what to do
if Edward died without children, since both the Lady Mary
and the Lady <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> had been declared illegitimate and
cut off from the succession. With sound common sense
Henry broke through the legal tangle of his own making, and
declared that both should succeed to the throne in order of
birth. But there was still a further difficulty if <persName key="Mary Tudor">Mary</persName>and
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> died, like Edward, without issue, since by strict
law, the little Queen of Scots, the grand-daughter of Henry's
elder sister, would become queen. Henry saw that English
feeling would not yet tolerate a Scottish ruler, and, sweeping
away the right of the elder line, he declared that the
descendants of his younger sister Mary, Duchess of Suffolk,
should immediately follow his own children, as inheritors
of the throne. But the power of the strongest king dies
with him, and Henry's will was never altogether carried
out. Yet the succession of his three children in the order
which he had appointed showed that the old despot interpreted
English feeling in his death as in his life.

<p>  1. <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>. was not ten years old when he became
king. He was a sickly boy, with a consumptive taint, short
for his age, with fair skin, high forehead, weak              <note place="foot" n="1">Character of <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>.</note>
eyes, and some tendency to deafness.  He
was grave and precocious, and his schooling was forced
on so early that he cared little for his play, and delighted
to hide away in some remote chamber with his books, in
which he showed a wonderful proficiency when still a
mere baby. He had few friends, and lived a solitary
and melancholy life, busying himself from the beginning







<pb id="p.52" n="52"/>                       <note place="foot" n="2"> [<date value="1547">1547</date>--<date value="1547">1547</date>.]</note>

with high problems of theology and politics, and showing
little natural affection for his kinsfolk. He was very
religious. No study delighted him more than that of the
Scriptures, of which he read ten chapters daily; and he
took pleasure in listening to sermons, and in taking notes
of them. He specially loved the shrewd honest preaching
of Hugh Latimer, who exercised an excellent influence over
him.   Edward early became an ardent reformer, and
keenly sympathised with the religious policy of those who
ruled England for him. When still a boy he eagerly followed
the course of politics, noting down in the journal,
which he kept from his accession, the chief occurrences of
the time. The "godly disposition" of the "English Josiah"
was extravagantly lauded by the reforming party; but as he
grew up he showed traces of his father's self-confidence,
harshness, and want of feeling, as well as of his firm will
and splendid dignity of bearing.  But everything was
against him, and his faults should not be too harshly
remembered.</p><p>
  2. The triumph of Hertford over Norfolk and Surrey,
while the old king lay dying, secured for the reforming
<note place="foot" n="3">Protectorate of Somerset,<dateRange from="1547" to="1549">1547-1549</dateRange>. </note>
party the possession of the power for which
   they had been striving so long. <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.s
              plan for a carefully balanced council of regency
was put aside, and Hertford was made Lord Protector with
something of royal authority, having power to act with or
without the Council, and "to do anything which a governor
of the king's person and protector of the realm ought to do."
He assumed the title of Duke of Somerset, and scattered
peerages among his friends, his brother Thomas becoming
Lord Seymour of Sudeley and Lord High Admiral, and
Lisle being made Earl of Warwick. Gardiner and the
other leaders of the old learning were excluded from the
Council.</p><p>
  Somerset was an ardent reformer, who really believed in
his principles, and who now strove to do everything in a
hurry to make up for the weary years of waiting while his
brother-in-law had lived. He was more honest than most
of the statesmen of the time, though he was greedy beyond
measure in appropriating Church property for himself. His
soft words and gracious manner, his real sympathy for the
poor and the suffering, and his bravery and skill as a soldier,
combined to give him popularity, but he soon showed
obstinacy where pliancy was needed, and weakness where
he should have manifested strength. He had little practical







   <pb id="p.53" n="53"/>
wisdom, no power of compromise, and small insight into
public opinion. He failed in his foreign policy, when he
sought to carry out the ideas of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>., but he was
equally unsuccessful at home when he strove to repudiate
all that Henry had striven for. After less than three years
he fell utterly from power.
</p><p>
  3. England was at peace with<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> when the new
reign began, and a prudent ruler would have steered clear of foreign
complications during the troubles of a minority. But                                 <note place="foot" n="4">Foreign Politics,<dateRange from="1547" to="1550">1547-1550</dateRange>.</note>
Somerset, though his hands were full with the reforming
of the English Church, was unpractical enough to
think the moment come when he could carry out <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s old
plan of uniting England and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> by the marriage of the little
king and queen. Religion also moved him in the same direction, for
lie hoped for the support of the Scots reformers, whose stronghold at
St. Andrews had recently been captured by the French auxiliaries of
the Scots government. Though there was an opening for prudence
and diplomacy, the means taken by Somerset to unite the kingdoms
made union impossible for another two generations. He talked of
reviving <persName key="Edward I">Edward I</persName>.'s claims of overlordship over <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, and on
4th September <date value="1547">1547</date> crossed the Borders at the head of a great army,
a large proportion of which was cavalry, to carry out his policy by
sheer superiority of strength. All <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> united to oppose foreign
invasion, and a numerous Scots army took up a strong position on
the left bank of the Esk, over against Musselburgh, hoping to protect
Edinburgh, which had previously suffered so severely from Somerset's
hands. On 8th September Somerset occupied the heights on the right
bank of the river, while the English fleet, anchored close ashore in the
Forth, threatened the left flank of the Scots. For
two days the armies watched each other, but, early on
<note place="foot" n="5"> Battle of Pinki Cleugh,  <date value="1547-09-10">10th Sept1547</date>.</note>
the 10th, the Scots in their eagerness to attack
Somerset, abandoned their strong position, crossed.
the Esk over Musselburgh bridge, and marched against the English
posted on the high ground beyond. This led to the decisive battle of
Musselburgh or Pinkie Cleugh. The English moved down to meet
the enemy, and the Scots pikemen, standing in dense array, after the
ancient fashion, valiantly withstood the shock of Lord Grey's cavalry,
which charged them downhill. The English horse broke and fled,
but the pikemen were powerless to pursue them uphill, and halted in
a dangerous position; where their columns were soon broken up by the
merciless fire of the English from their higher quarters. The military
skill of Warwick, who led the middle portion of the English army,
now changed the fortunes of the day. He poured fresh masses of
English cavalry down the hill, and this time the pikemen were at their
mercy. The Scots army fled in disorder, and the English, with insignificant
losses to themselves, utterly destroyed it. Leith was burned,
and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> again ruthlessly plundered. But the military triumph
of the Protector was more than outbalanced by his political failure.
Indignant at the armed wooing of the English king, the Scots
renewed their treaty with<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, where Henry II. had just succeeded
his father, Francis I., as king. In <date value="1548">1548</date> the little queen was sent







<pb id="p.54" n="54"/>                                <note place="foot" n="6">[<date value="1547">1547</date>--<date value="1550">1550</date>.]</note>

beyond sea to be educated as a Frenchwoman and a Catholic, and
the destined bride of the future French king, Henry's son Francis.
Her mother, Mary of Guise, henceforth ruled <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> in the French
and Catholic interest, and for more than ten years the cause of the
Reformation seemed utterly eclipsed. French troops were sent to
<placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, and effectually prevented a renewal of the policy of invasion.
In revenge for the attack on <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, the French assailed Boulogne,
and after a long struggle won it back. After Somerset's fall peace
was made with both countries on conditions that reversed all the
successes of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. (<date value="1550">1550</date>).

<p>
  4. Somerset threw himself heartily into the work of
reforming the Church, and giving up Henry's idea of a






       <pb id="p.55" n="55"/>

middle way, strove to make England Protestant after
the German fashion. Cranmer entirely agreed with him,
having long been secretly influenced by the
<note place="foot" n="7">The Reformation under Somerset,<dateRange from="1547" to="1549">1547-1549</dateRange>;</note>
German Lutherans, though he soon went
beyond their teaching. The archbishop was a
wretched politician, his weakness of character and deference
to the great making him the tool of all factions in succession,
but he was a man of some learning and much refinement
of feeling, possessing a singular power of writing
good English, a power he was now able to employ to the
great advantage of the Church. His delicate scholarship
and timidity combined to make him a lover of ancient
forms, even when he was fast departing from their spirit,
and did something to prevent him from utterly deserting the
ways of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. Too weak to withstand the greedy
courtiers, who soon outvied Somerset in their pretended
zeal for reformation, he was still able to go on working
quietly to establish the new system on sound lines. It is
largely due to the influence of Cranmer that, amidst the
fierce passions and fiercer self-seeking of the reign of
<persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>., some solid results remained, that permanently
affected for good the course of religion in England.</p><p>
  Immediately after the young king's accession, the bishops
were compelled to take out new appointments by letters
patent, in order to emphasise the fact that they were mere
officials of state, with no independent power or divine
right. Then a general royal visitation of the whole country
was held to enforce the Royal Supremacy, and remove
images and other "superstitious" emblems from  the
churches. The bishops of the old school, headed by Gardiner
and Bonner, struggled in vain against the visitors.
A book of English Homilies was next set up, as a sort of
authorised sermons, which the clergy were to read to
their flocks. Parliament ordered that the Holy Communion
should be administered in both kinds, repealed the Six
Articles, and the other Acts of Henry creating new
treasons and heresies. A new Act was passed granting to
the king such colleges, chantries, and free chapels as had
escaped confiscation under <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>., and the councillors
made haste to make themselves rich with the spoils.
A mere fraction of the proceeds was kept for national
purposes.  Some schools and hospitals which the ancient
ecclesiastical colleges had maintained, were " refounded,"
and perhaps a few new ones set up.  These measures
have given <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>. a very undeserved reputation as a






<pb id="p.56" n="56"/>                       <note place="foot" n="8">  [<date value="1549">1549</date>--<date value="1549">1549</date>.]</note>
founder of grammar schools and patron of learning. This
credit is not much better merited than the cheap fame won
in the same way by <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. In other ways the Church
was impoverished.   Somerset himself pulled   down
churches and bishops' houses, to build himself a palace in
the Strand. Cranmer was little more than a reed in his
hands, and powerless to protect the Church. The clergy
obtained a grudging permission to marry, and had their
tithes secured to them. But they shared in the growing
demoralisation, and many sought to make a little harvest
on their own account. A few strenuous preachers of the new
faith strove to kindle the sluggish zeal of a people who had
grown careless of the old order, without any real enthusiasm
for the new. Conspicuous among these was Hugh Latimer,
who, refusing another bishopric, preferred to work as a
simple preacher. He lamented that things were worse than
in the "old days of Popery," and in plain homely language
sought to make men ashamed of their greed and selfishness</p><p>
   5. The most important change now brought about was
the abolition of the Latin services, and the setting up of a
<note place="foot" n="9">The First Prayer Book of <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>.<date value="1549">1549</date> </note>
new English Prayer Book. Some steps in
 this direction had been already taken under
<persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>., and, since <date value="1543">1543</date>, Cranmer's committee
had been hard at work. In <date value="1547">1547</date>, when
Communion in both kinds was ordered, an English form
of receiving that Sacrament was drawn up. At last, in
<date value="1549">1549</date>, the Act of Uniformity was passed, enjoining the
reading in all English churches of the form of service
known as the First Prayer Book of <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>. It was
a very careful and reverent translation of the medieval
Latin services into the vulgar tongue, with a few omissions
and additions, and the putting together of the numerous
short forms of service of the ancient Church into the order
for Morning and Evening Prayer, but with great care
shown not to wound the feelings of lovers of old ways.
This was especially seen in the Communion Service, which
taught the Real Presence and the Eucharistic Sacrifice,
and carefully kept most of the ancient ceremonies. Such
a little way did it go that the ardent reformers were dissatisfied
with it, and those who hated the changes, like
Bonner, could still try to carry on the new services in the
old spirit, and with the old ceremonies. Accordingly,
another royal visitation was held to enforce the new service
book. Bonner was deprived of his bishopric, and imprisoned
for the rest of the reign.

6. Besides the religious revolution, the social and
economic changes that had caused so much misery under
Henrv VIII. were still far from having run their course.
The only remedy that Council and Parliament could find
for poverty was a severe law that any "vagabond" might
be seized and kept as a slave for two years, being forced to
work on bread and water and liable to be beaten at his
master's pleasure, while if he escaped, he became a slave
for life.</p><p>
  Somerset had let loose powers that he was not strong
enough to control, and the quarrels of the councillors
further distracted the realm and weakened the government.
Pirates plundered the coasts, and the government could
only pay its way by coining bad money, and forcing people
to receive it as good. Somerset's brother, Lord Seymour of
Sudeley, "a man of much wit and very little judgment,"
strove to rise into power as the mouthpiece of the prevailing
discontent. He married <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s widow, and on her
death sought to marry the Lady <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. He used his
position as Admiral to make friends with the pirates whom
he was sent to put down, and supplied himself with funds
by obtaining the control of the Bristol mint.                                     <note place="foot" n="10">Execution of Lord Seymour of Sudeley, <date value="1549">1549</date>.</note>
But he was too headstrong and rash to play
his part properly.  In March <date value="1549">1549</date> he was
executed as a traitor, being condemned by Act of Attainder.
But his brother's death gave Somerset only a short respite.
 </p><p> 7. Disgust at the Prayer Book led to a new Pilgrimage
of Grace in the south-west, where the first reading of the
English service on Whitsunday <date value="1549">1549</date> was followed            <note place="foot" n="11"> The risings of <date value="1549">1549</date>.</note>
 by a riot that soon grew into a widespread
popular insurrection of the conservative western
counties. The rebels denounced the new Prayer Book as
"like a Christmas game," and demanded the restoration of
the Mass and the Six Articles, and the recall of Cardinal
Pole.</p><p>
   While the Devonshire men rose to uphold the ancient
 order, bad government and social grievances led the men
 of Norfolk, where the reforming spirit was strongest, to
 take up arms against the Protectorate.  The eastern
 counties had suffered terribly from  the enclosure of
 commons, which had deprived the poor man of his rights of
 pasture, and by the turning of plough-lands into sheep-walks,
 against which More had long ago lifted up his voice.
 While the poor found it harder to get work, a few rich
 men made unhallowed gains at their expense. The new






<pb id="p.58" n="58"/>                   <note place="foot" n="12"> [<date value="1549">1549</date>--<date value="1550">1550</date>.] </note>

landlords, who had succeeded the monks, looked upon landholding
as a business, and rackrented their tenants to get
a high interest from their investments. The atrocious law
against vagabonds shows how bad the feeling between
class and class had become. A local dispute now set
the countryside ablaze. Robert  Ket, lord of the manor
of Wymondham, had a quarrel with a neighbouring
landlord, and put himself at the head of a mob which
was pulling down fences and denouncing enclosures.
Before long a great army had collected on Mousehold
Hill, outside Norwich, where Ket held a sort of court
under an oak-tree, which he called the Tree of Reformation.
Very moderate demands were sent up to the
Council, praying that enclosures should be restrained
and that "all bondmen may be made free, since God
made all free with His precious blood-shedding." Getting
no answer, Ket captured Norwich and defeated the royal
troops.</p><p>
  Somerset sympathised with the eastern rebels, but was
too weak to remedy their grievances. The revolts had to
<note place="foot" n="13">The end of the Protectorate,<date value="1549">1549</date>.</note>
be put down, and he was pushed aside by
 stronger men. As Englishmen declined to
 were employed who had no scruples. In August John
Russell, soon afterwards made Earl of Bedford, put down
the western revolt, while Warwick defeated the Norfolkmen
with terrible slaughter at Dussendale. The Council
now sought to get rid of Somerset altogether. In despair
he strove to rally the people on his side.  Early in
October he was degraded from the Protectorate and
confined to the Tower. With unwonted leniency, he was
soon released from prison, and even restored to the Council.
But his power was at an end. Henceforth the Council
resolved to keep the government in its own hands.
 </p><p> 8. It was hard for a weak man like Somerset to wield
the authority of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. It was impossible for a little
<note place="foot" n="14">The misrule of Warwick and the council, <dateRange from="1549" to="1553">1549-1553</dateRange>.</note>
knot of greedy and quarrelsome councillors
  even to affect to carry on the strong rule,
        which alone could save Tudor England from
anarchy. The councillors scrambled eagerly for wealth
and place, and Warwick, the strongest of them, was a
coarse, self-seeking soldier, who hid his ambition under
a popular and magnificent manner. Without religious
feeling himself, he now professed a great zeal for purifying
the Church, since each fresh step of religious reformation






        <pb id="p.59" n="59"/>

meant a fresh confiscation of Church property. Circumstances
favoured his policy. It was a dark time for Protestantism
on the Continent.  Luther was dead, and
<persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>., freed from his long rivalry with Francis,
was resolutely bent on stamping out the Reformation
in <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>. A swarm of Protestant exiles now sought
refuge in England. Among them were Martin Bucer, the
learned and judicious Strassburg reformer, and Peter
Martyr, an Italian, who were made professors of theology
at Cambridge and Oxford. Disciples of the foreign
schools gradually made their way to the front, conspicuous
among them being the accomplished and courteous
Nicholas Ridley, Cranmer's old chaplain, who became
Bishop of London on Bonner's deprivation, and was
conspicuous for his zeal in breaking down
<note place="foot" n="15"> Progress of the Reformation,<dateRange from="1549" to="1553">1549-1553</dateRange>.</note>
altars, and for his influence on the mind
of the archbishop.  A less temperate enthusiast
was John Hooper who, on being made bishop of
Gloucester in <date value="1551">1551</date>, refused to wear the "popish vestments"
necessary for his consecration, and only yielded
after a long imprisonment. Both of these were disciples
of the Zwinglian school, and Cranmer himself was now
drifting in their direction, having abandoned the doctrine
of the Real Presence. Most of the bishops of the old
school were deposed, Gardiner losing Winchester in
<date value="1551">1551</date>, and being, like Bonner, imprisoned for the rest of
the reign. The Council strove to prevent the Lady Mary,
who hated the religious changes, from continuing to have
the Latin Mass celebrated before her. After a long struggle
they were forced to yield before the steadfastness of Mary
and the threat of the Emperor to go to war if they per
sisted. With all their violence, the Reformers were less
sanguinary than <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. The only victims were a few
upholders of extreme opinions, of whom the chief was the
brave Anabaptist fanatic, Joan Bocher, burnt in <date value="1550">1550</date> for
denying the Incarnation. Even Zwinglians held that such
heresy as hers must be punished.</p><p>
   The scramble for Church property went on, and the
 government grew worse and worse. Bishops were forced
 to surrender their lands and received back a merely nominal
 equivalent.  Statesmen appointed themselves to high
 ecclesiastical dignities, pocketed the revenues and neglected
 the duties that they were, as laymen, not qualified to perform.
 Bishoprics were suppressed, including several of
 Henry's new sees. <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> was absorbed in London,






<pb id="p.60" n="60"/>        <note place="foot" n="16"> [<date value="1550">1550</date>.<date value="1553">1553</date>.]</note>

and Gloucester, Hooper's diocese, was again united to
Worcester. The wealthy see of Durham was similarly
suppressed. It was plain that little Church property would
soon be left. The revenues of the universities and their
colleges were threatened, and scholars almost ceased to
attend them, or proper candidates to offer themselves for
the ministry. There was much discontent, but few dared
to give it tongue. In <date value="1550">1550</date> Hugh Latimer, who had spoken
too plainly to please the Council, was ordered to preach
no more before the king. In their despair people looked
to the discredited Somerset as a possible deliverer from
the misrule of the Council. But the king coldly upheld
Warwick against his uncle, and Somerset was arrested,
convicted of felony, and beheaded on 22nd January <date value="1552">1552</date>,
amidst the hearty sorrow of the people, who still looked on
him as their friend. Warwick, now fully triumphant, was
made Duke of Northumberland. He had the ear of the
young king, and could carry everything as he would.
</p><p>  The forms of the earlier years of Edward's reign seemed
to the disciples of the Swiss reformers, who now directed the
<note place="foot" n="17">The Prayer Book of <date value="1552">1552</date>.</note>
policy of the Church, to be wanting in primitive
simplicity. Accordingly the Prayer Book
  was recast, and superseded by the Second Prayer
Book of <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>., enjoined by the Act of Uniformity of
<date value="1552">1552</date>. This compilation marked a very great advance of
the Zwinglian spirit. The changes in the Communion
Service bring this out plainly. The words used in distributing
the Bread in <date value="1549">1549</date> had clearly suggested the Real
Presence. In <date value="1552">1552</date> new words were brought in which
seemed to point in the direction of the Zwinglian doctrine
that the Eucharist was nothing but a memorial Supper.
But even these changes did not go far enough for many.
Some objected to elaborate forms of prayer at all; many
complained of the obligation of the communicants to
receive the Sacrament on their knees. To satisfy them a
rubric, called the Black Rubric by the foes of the
advanced reformers, was added explaining that nothing
idolatrous was implied in the custom. But great as were
the changes in spirit, the real sympathy that Cranmer still
showed for the ancient forms, and his rare command of
dignified and appropriate language raised the Prayer Book
of <date value="1552">1552</date> above the fierce passions of the hour, and made it
one of the most permanent and precious results of the
reign. Substantially it is the same as the present Prayer
Book of the English Church.</p><p>






       <pb id="p.61" n="61"/>

  A new form of doctrine was now drafted in the Forty-Two
  Articles of <date value="1553">1553</date>, largely based on the Lutheran
confession of faith, and the basis of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s Thirty-Nine
Articles. Even more than the Prayer Book, they
show how completely the English Church had abandoned
the doctrines of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. and adopted those of the
Reformers. A code of Protestant ecclesiastical law, called
the Reformatio Legum Ecclesiasticarum, was also drawn
up, but there was no time to have it made law.
 </p><p> 9. Change succeeded change, until the misrule of the
ruling faction produced murmurs even from the subservient
Commons, who, in passing a new Treasons
<note place="foot" n="18">Northumberland's plan for the Succession, <date value="1553">1553</date>.</note>
Act, insisted on adding a clause that no one
should be convicted of treason except by the
evidence of two witnesses at least. Nevertheless Northumberland,
secure of the support both of the courtiers and
the advanced reformers, seemed firmly established in power.
Unluckily for him the king's health began to break up, and
it was soon clear that the sickly and overwrought boy had
not long to live. By <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s will, the Lady Mary was
the next heir, and she was an uncompromising friend of the
Mass. The dying king was much concerned at the light
of the Gospel being put out by his death, and Northumberland
easily made him the instrument of an audacious plan
to change the succession. He persuaded Edward that he
had the same power to determine who should be the next
sovereign as <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. had exercised, though Henry
had an Act of Parliament at his back, and Edward had not.
He further induced the king to exclude from the succession
not only Mary, but <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, who was not unfriendly to
the new system. In their stead Edward bequeathed the
throne to the Lady Jane Grey, the eldest child of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>s,
  Duchess of Suffolk, the daughter of Mary, <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s
  sister, by her second husband, Charles Brandon, Duke
  of Suffolk. The innocent victim of Northumberland's
  ambition was a young girl of sixteen, of sweet temper,
  strong will, and great devotion to the reformed doctrines.
  She was so fond of her books that she stayed at home to
  read Plato, when all her family went out hunting. She
  was now married against her will to Northumberland's son
  Lord Guildford Dudley. Thus Northumberland hoped to
  reign through his daughter-in-law.
  </p><p>  Edward loved Lady Jane, and gladly fell in with
  Northumberland's advice. There was more difficulty in
  forcing the scheme on the Council, but, like Northumberland






 <pb id="p.62" n="62"/>          <note place="foot" n="19"> [<date value="1553">1553</date>--<date value="1554">1554</date>.] </note>

 , the councillors were afraid of Mary, and were too
  deeply pledged to draw back. Cranmer was loath to agree,
  but finally yielded with characteristic weakness. On 6th
  July <date value="1553">1553</date> Edward died.</p><p>
    1O. For two days the king's death was kept secret, and
<note place="foot" n="20">  Queen Jane and   Queen Mary,<date value="1553-07-10">10-19 July1553</date>.</note>
  when further delay was impossible, Jane was
  proclaimed queen in London on 10th July,
            amidst a significant silence. Ridley preached
  in her favour to little purpose, and outside the capital no
  one thought of obeying her.  Mary fled to the eastern
  counties, where the gentry of the most Protestant part of
  England flocked to her with every sign of enthusiasm.
  Northumberland hurried against her, but he had only
  reached Cambridge, when his troops mutinied, and he
  gave up the struggle. On 19th July, Suffolk told his
  daughter that her reign was over, and himself proclaimed
  Mary at the Tower gates, and the news was welcomed
  amid " bell ringing, blazes, and shouts of applause." The
  conspirators and their victims were cast into prison. On
  3rd August the new queen made her solemn entry into
  London.  The Protestant misrule was over, and the
  daughter of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. had come to restore her father's
  house against the self-seeking duke, who had played for
  high stakes and lost.

<p>  1. Though only thirty-seven, the new queen was prematurely
aged by weak health, and soured by her miserable
<note place="foot" n="1">Character of Queen Mary.</note>
girlhood. She was of low stature, thin, and
              delicate, with grave and sedate looks, and
plain features, though her piercing eye commanded respect,
and her deep-toned masculine voice could speak eloquently
and strongly. She had good abilities, and had been well
educated, knowing three languages, and delighting in music.
Her kindness and charity made her beloved by her servants
and intimates. Though the fierce Tudor will and temper
flamed up from time to time, she had learnt by adversity to
keep them under strict control. Friendless as she had
been, she had ever remained true to her mother's memory,
and was proud of her Spanish descent and kinship to the
Emperor, no less than of her unblemished orthodoxy and






        <pb id="p.63" n="63"/>

ardent devotion to the ancient faith. She was known to be
utterly opposed to the policy of her brother's ministers, and
in welcoming her as queen, Englishmen hoped to get rid of
the self-seekers and innovators, who had brought the realm
so low.</p><p>
  2. The first acts of Mary gave general satisfaction. The
prisons were opened, and old Norfolk, Gardiner, Bonner,
and the other victims of Protestant policy were
<note place="foot" n="2">The Restoration of the System of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.,<dateRange from="1553" to="1554">1553-1554</dateRange></note>
restored to their dignities. A new Council
was set up which contained few of Edward's
advisers, and Gardiner was made Chancellor.
A very few victims atoned for the attempt to uphold Jane
Dudley. Though Lady Jane and her husband were condemned
to death, there was no thought of carrying out the
sentence.  Her father, Suffolk, was released, through
Mary's affection for her mother; and only Northumberland,
with two of his subordinate agents, was put to death. On
the scaffold, Northumberland avowed himself a Catholic,
and set down all the misfortunes of England to the breach
with Rome. The Protestant bishops were deprived, imprisoned,
or driven beyond sea, and foreign Protestants were
ordered out of the realm. Parliament soon met, declared
Mary Henry's lawful daughter, repealed <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>.'s
Acts concerning religion, and brought back the Six Articles,
the Mass, and the unmarried clergy, leaving the Church as
it had been at the death of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. For more than
a year, no further religious changes were effected. Mary
even assumed her father's title of Supreme Head of the
Church. Most Englishmen were well content with the
queen's restoration of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s middle way, but Mary
was by no means satisfied with it.  The daughter of
Catharine of Aragon as little loved the system of her
father, built up, as it was, on her mother's shame, as she
loved the innovations of her brother. Her ardent wish
was to have things as they had been before her mother's
marriage was questioned.  Politically she was anxious
to restore the imperial alliance. Ecclesiastically, she was
eager to have back the Pope and the monks. Both her
desires met with strong opposition, but ultimately her
fierce persistency almost realised her objects.</p><p>
  3. Parliament strongly urged the queen to marry
an English nobleman, but there was no one                      <note place="foot" n="3">The Spanish MarriageTreaty,<date value="1554-01"> January1554</date>.</note>
who seemed suitable, and <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>., who
had always befriended his cousin in her days
of trouble, offered her as a husband his son, Philip,






<pb id="p.64" n="64"/>        <note place="foot" n="4">[<date value="1554">1554</date>--<date value="1554">1554</date>.]</note>

Prince of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, who was eleven years her junior, and a
widower. To many of the Council, including Gardiner, the
proposal seemed a dangerous one. The pair were personally
ill matched, and as <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>.'s health was already
broken, Philip was likely soon to inherit most of his
dominions. Though he had a son by his former marriage,
English patriotism, remembering that lucky marriages had
built up the dominions of <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>., revolted at the possibility,
if the little Don Carlos were to die, of England
being absorbed in the Spanish Empire. Even an alliance
with <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> was no longer looked upon with much favour,
despite the ancient ties that bound the two countries.
Moreover Philip was already famous for his uncompromising zeal
for Catholicism, and a union with him
could hardly be effected on terms that left <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s
legislation standing. All these reasons only made Mary
the more anxious to complete a match, which would at one
stroke realise all her ambitions. She answered Parliament
that it had no right to limit her choice of a husband, and
at once began negotiations for her marriage with Philip.
In January <date value="1554">1554</date> the marriage treaty was drawn up. Husband
and wife were to assume each other's titles, but
careful provision was made that England should be
separate and independent from  <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, that none but
Englishmen should hold office in England, and that
England should not be dragged into the war, which Charles
had been waging against<placeName key="France">France</placeName> since <date value="1552">1552</date>.</p><p>
  4. Three popular revolts followed the announcement of
the treaty and showed how much the marriage was hated.
<note place="foot" n="5">The Wyatt Rebellion, Jan-Feb, and the Spanish Marriage,<date value="1554-07-25"> 25thJuly, 1554</date>.</note>
Suffolk, forgetful of what he owed to Mary's
 mercy, strove to raise the Midlands, while
 Sir Peter Carew stirred up his native Devonshire,
  and Sir Thomas Wyatt, a gallant young
   Kentish gentleman, son of Wyatt the poet,
started an insurrection in Kent and Sussex.  Suffolk
was easily defeated and taken prisoner; Carew fled to
France without accomplishing anything, and Wyatt's
rebellion alone proved formidable.  Fifteen thousand
turbulent Kentishmen followed him on his march to
London, and occupied Southwark. There was a panic in
the City, but the queen went down to the Guildhall and
filled the Londoners with courage by her timely and
courageous eloquence.  Meanwhile Wyatt, abandoning
Southwark, crossed the Thames at Kingston and hurried
to London from the west. As soon as he got among the






         <pb id="p.65" n="65"/>

houses, he was overpowered and captured. The queen
dealt with this second rising more sternly than with the
first. Not only were Suffolk and Wyatt and other actual
rebels executed, but Lady Jane and Lord Guildford were
also put to death under the old sentence. Gardiner urged
that the Lady <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, whose claims the rebels had been
thought to favour, should incur the same fate. She was
imprisoned in the Tower, but Mary could not bring herself
to lay hands upon her sister, and Wyatt with his dying
breath declared that she had had no knowledge of the
conspiracy. A little later Parliament gave a grudging
approval of the marriage treaty, though it was not until
July that the sluggish Philip came to England and was
married to Mary by Bishop Gardiner in Winchester
Cathedral. Philip prudently kept aloof from English
politics, following the shrewd advice of Renard, his father's
ambassador. He persuaded his wife to set free her sister
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, who was now again received into the queen's
favour. With great wisdom <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> henceforth kept
on fair terms with her sister, zealously attending Mass,
and scrupulously keeping herself free from suspicion of
disloyalty.</p><p>
   5. Mary had now accomplished half her purpose, and
immediately set about carrying out the reconciliation
with Rome. She had to contend against the                 <note place="foot" n="6">The Reconciliation with Rome,<date value="1554-11"> Nov.1554</date>.</note>
active hostility of some and the indifference
of most of her councillors. Gardiner, her
chief adviser, had won his reputation by defending the
Royal Supremacy, but the experience of Edward's reign led
him to think that <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s middle way was impossible,
and that there was no choice save between the Pope and
the extreme Protestants. As he had always fought against
the latter, he had now no scruple in going back to his
allegiance to the former. Love of money, not religious
principle,long delayed the papal restoration. The lay nobles,
who had been enriched with the spoils of the Church, were
hard to win over, especially as it was known that the queen
was as anxious to restore Church property to its ancient
owners as she was to bring back the Pope. Even the
Emperor and the Pope were reluctant to hurry the English
into an unwilling restoration of the Papacy; and few shared
Mary's impatience at the long delay except her cousin,
Cardinal Pole, who had for nearly twenty years represented
uncompromising hostility to the Anglican Reformation at
the Roman court, and had since her accession been vainly







<pb id="p.66" n="66"/>              <note place="foot" n="7"> [<date value="1554">1554</date>--<date value="1555">1555</date>.]</note>

trying to effect an entrance into the country as papal
legate. At last it was seen that the Pope could be restored
only if the monasteries were frankly abandoned to
their lay owners. The Pope promised not to insist upon
the restitution of Church lands, and all difficulties were removed.
In November <date value="1554">1554</date> Parliament met at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.
The sheriffs had been exhorted to return members of " a
wise, grave, and Catholic sort," and the result showed that
the art of managing elections was already well understood.
Parliament repealed <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s legislation against
Rome, revived the ancient laws against heresy, and declared
unlawful the title of Supreme Head of the Church,
which Mary had borne for nearly two years. One of its
first acts was to reverse the Act of Attainder, which in
Henry's time had been passed against Cardinal Pole. The
legate now arrived in London, and was rowed up to <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>
in a barge of state, at whose prow glittered a great
silver cross, the emblem of his office.  Mary welcomed
him with the utmost warmth. "The day I ascended the
throne," she declared, "I did not feel such joy." A few
days later, Pole solemnly absolved England from the guilt
of schism and pronounced its restoration to Catholic unity.
After eighteen months of hard struggle, Mary had undone
the work of her father, almost as completely as she had
upset that of her brother. Public opinion, if not enthusiastic,
did not oppose the change. There had been revolts
against the Spanish marriage. There were none against
the reconciliation with the Papacy.</p><p>
  6. Now that the ancient Church had been fully restored,
there still remained the question of how to deal with those
<note place="foot" n="8">The Marian Persecution,<dateRange from="1555" to="1558">1555-1558</dateRange>.</note>
who obstinately refused to accept the Marian
                   reaction. These were comparatively few in
number. The rule of Somerset and Northumberland had
in no wise made the English nation Protestant; but
there were many zealous reforming clergy, and in the
southern and eastern parts of the country they had a
considerable following. It was against all the traditions
of the time that these should be allowed to worship
after their own way. Everybody agreed that to tolerate
error was both a sin and a mistake, and it was looked
upon as something like rebellion for a subject to presumptuously
reject the religion of the state. <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.

had burnt Anabaptists and shut up Romanists in prison.
Calvin was equally intolerant, and <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>. was busily






          <pb id="p.67" n="67"/>

engaged in stamping out heresy in the Netherlands. It
was inevitable then that those who refused to accept
Mary's changes should be persecuted, and it is unfair to
regard Mary and her ministers as specially blameworthy
for doing, a little more energetically than usual, what all
parties agreed that it was right to do. Early in  555 Pole
set up a commission to try heretics, and on 2nd February
John Rogers, a prebendary of St Paul's, who had taken a
prominent part in translating the Bible into English, was
the first martyr. Others rapidly followed.                <note place="foot" n="9"> Martyrdom ofHooper,<date value="1555-02-09"> 9th Feb.1555</date></note>
Bishop Hooper of Gloucester and Worcester,
had opposed the rash attempt to set aside
Mary, but had, early in the new reign, been thrown into
prison, and had been used "worse and more vilely than
the veriest slave." He was now deprived of his bishopric,
and condemned as a heretic. To make a more public
example, he was sent down to Gloucester, and burnt on 9th
February, in the very town where he had upheld extreme
Protestantism. A less prominent bishop suffered in March
in Bishop Ferrar of St David's, who, for similar reasons,
was burnt at Carmarthen, the chief town of his diocese.
Before the end of the year nearly one hundred Protestants
had been horribly slaughtered.</p><p>
  Among the chief of the victims were Latimer, Ridley,
and Cranmer. Latimer was now an old and "sore bruised
man," and he had carefully kept free from the                <note place="foot" n="10">Martyrdom of Ridley and Latimer,<date value="1555-10-16">16th Oct1555</date></note>
snares of Northumberland, living now in the
country, but still rising at two in the morning
to study, and preaching twice every Sunday.
He was summoned to London, but every chance was given
him to escape, as many others had escaped, to the
Continent. The old hero scorned to flee, and cheerfully
went up to London for his doom. Ridley and Cranmer
were in a worse plight, being both deeply implicated in the
Northumberland conspiracy. But it was thought better
to wait and try them as heretics, than to hurry them to a
swifter doom as traitors. In <date value="1554-03"> March1554</date>, Latimer, Ridley,
and Cranmer were all sent to Oxford, to dispute with
Catholic divines on the doctrine of the Mass. Latimer
declared that he was "no better able to discuss theology
than to be Captain of Calais, but that he had read over the
New Testament many times without finding the Mass in
it, nor yet the marrow-bones and sinews thereof." After a
stormy discussion, they were all adjudged heretics; but
long delays now followed, and it was not till






<pb id="p.68" n="68"/>          <note place="foot" n="11"> [<date value="1555">1555</date>--<date value="1556">1556</date>.]</note>

<date value="1555-09">September1555</date> that a commission of bishops went to Oxford to
deal finally with them. After more disputations, Ridley
and Latimer were sentenced on 1st October, and on 16th
October were taken out to die on the north side of the
town, "in the ditch over against Balliol College." Both
refused to recant, and were fastened to the stake by an
iron chain, while Ridley's brother was mercifully allowed
to hang bags of gunpowder round their necks to shorten
their sufferings. As the faggots were lighting, old Latimer
cried, " Be of good comfort, Master Ridley; we shall this
day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England as I
trust shall never be put out." He died with little pain, but
Ridley suffered terrible torments.</p><p>
  Cranmer still remained. There were legal difficulties in
dealing with him, as he had been consecrated before the
<note place="foot" n="12">Martyrdom of Cranmer, <date value="1556-03-21">21st March,1556</date>. </note>
schism began, and had duly received his
 pallium from the Pope.  He was therefore
 summoned to answer for heresy at Rome,
but the Pope appointed a commissioner to try him in
England.  This involved long delays.  It was months
after he had witnessed from his prison Ridley and Latimer
going to their doom, before his turn came for judgment.
However, he was condemned at Rome, and, after his
deprivation, the Pope appointed Pole Archbishop of
Canterbury by papal provision. On 12th February <date value="1556">1556</date>
Cranmer was solemnly degraded from his orders, and
after his priestly garb had been torn from him, he was
clad in a poor yeoman's gown, and handed over to the
secular arm. He was now plied with arguments and
entreaties to recant. He was nearly seventy, and "sore
broken in studies." He had never been a man of strong
character, and his views had shifted so often, that he
might well have been still perplexed with doubts. Moreover
he had firmly believed in the Royal Supremacy, and
now the Supreme Head of the Church had chosen to
acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Pope. At last he was
persuaded to recant. His cruel enemies made him drink
the cup of humiliation to the dregs.  He was forced to
sign no less than seven forms of abjuration, in one of
which he abjectly compared himself to the penitent thief
on the cross. But his weakness could not save his life,
for there was no mercy for the man who had divorced
Catharine of Aragon and bastardised her daughter.
Despite his recantations, on 21st March he was doomed
to die. Before the execution a sermon was preached over






         <pb id="p.69" n="69"/>

him in the University Church, and at the end he was
called upon to read his abjurations. But he had won
back his courage in the presence of death.  After a
few indifferent remarks, he addressed himself to the
purpose. "I come," he said, "to the great thing which
so much troubleth my conscience. I renounce and refuse
all such bills and papers as I have written or signed
with my hand since my degradation, wherein I have
written many things untrue. And as my hand offended,
my hand therefore shall first be punished, and shall be
first burnt." Amidst general astonishment he was hurried
from the church to the stake.  When the wood was
kindled, he plunged his right hand into the flame, exclaiming,
"This hand hath offended." His courageous end did
much to redeem the weakness of his life.</p><p>
  Gardiner died in <date value="1555">1555</date>, but Pole and Bonner kept up the persecution.
  Before Mary's death there had been two hundred
and eighty-six victims in less than four years. The martyrs
were either clergymen or poor and humble folk, and practically
all came from a small corner of the country. In the
North, in <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>, and in the South-west there were no Protestants
to burn. Four dioceses contributed nearly all the
sufferers. From Bonner's diocese of London (<placeName key="Middlesex">Middlesex</placeName>,
<placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>, Herts) came nearly half. Next in the order of
victims was Pole's diocese of Canterbury, including most
of Kent.  Norwich (Norfolk and part of <placeName key="Suffolk">Suffolk</placeName>), and
Chichester (Sussex) were the only other dioceses where
victims were numerous, though in fourteen other sees
there were a small number of deaths, ranging from seven
to one. The limitation of the persecution to so short
a time and so small an area, made it the more severe;
and callous as was the Englishman of the sixteenth
century, sympathy with the martyrs did more to set up a
Protestant party in England, than all the preaching of
Ridley or the laws of Somerset and Northumberland. As
usual persecution overshot the mark.</p><p>
   7. Already, perhaps, conscious that the persecution was
 a failure, Mary feverishly strove to win back for her Church
 its old place in her subjects' hearts. She per-                <note place="foot" n="13">Mary's Misfortunes.</note>
 suaded her reluctant Parliament to restore
 First Fruits to the Pope, and strove in vain to rekindle the
 old love of the monastic life. Despite her crippled finances,
 she reopened several religious houses, including the royal
 foundation of St. Peter's, <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, where the shrine of
 St. Edward was again pieced together and brought back to






<pb id="p.70" n="70"/>            <note place="foot" n="14">[<date value="1557">1557</date>--<date value="1558">1558</date>.] </note>

its proud place behind the high altar. Few of her subjects
followed her example, and her zeal only excited suspicion
and mistrust. The home government of Mary was little
more efficient than that of her brother, and the House of
Commons turned restive for the first time since the Tudors
became sovereigns. There were several threatened risings.
The most formidable was that of Thomas Stafford, a grandson
of Buckingham, who seized Scarborough Castle, with
French help, and declared himself Protector of England,
but was taken and executed. Protestant refugees of the
bolder sort got ships from<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and turned to piracy,
plundering the English coasts. Moreover, Mary's health
was giving way, and her domestic life was very unhappy.
Save Pole, she had no real friend; and Philip, her husband,
had left her in the autumn of <date value="1555">1555</date>, and neglected her
utterly for nearly two years. In <date value="1557">1557</date> he came back to
England, and again pretended affection, in the hope of
persuading her to break the marriage treaty, by helping
him in his wars against<placeName key="France">France</placeName>.</p><p>
   8. Between <date value="1552">1552</date> and <date value="1559">1559</date> another great struggle was
 fought between<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and the Empire, in which Henry II.
<note place="foot" n="15"> War with<placeName key="France">France</placeName>,<dateRange from="1557" to="1559">1557-1559</dateRange>.</note>
 joined the German Protestants in defeating
  <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>.'s policy in <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>, and combined
           with Pope Paul IV. to overturn his domina tion
           in Italy. Both parties looked for the help of England,
 and so early as <date value="1553">1553</date> the French had wished well to Lady
 Jane Grey because the Emperor supported Queen Mary.
 <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>., crippled with gout and weary at the failure of
 his schemes, now made up his mind to abdicate. He had
 lost all hope of upholding the unity of his dominions, and
 was forced to yield up his German possessions with the
 prospect of the imperial succession to his brother Ferdinand,
 King of Hungary and Bohemia, and the founder of the
 junior or Austrian branch of the house of Hapsburg. In
 <date value="1556">1556</date> Charles surrendered all his other dominions to Philip,
 who thus became King of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> and the Indies, King of
 Naples, Duke of Milan, Lord of the Seventeen Provinces
 of the Netherlands and of the Free County of Burgundy.
 Despite the loss of the Empire Philip II. was still the chief
 prince of Europe, and he resolved to make a great effort to
 end the languishing war.</p><p>
 In <date value="1557">1557</date> Mary was persuaded to declare war against
<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, but the English took little part in the struggle,
 which Philip was able to bring to a triumphant close without them. I

          <pb id="p.71" n="71"/>

France at his feet, while his generals fought Pope Paul IV.,
who, at the head of an Italian alliance, was seeking to restore
the French power in Italy. England was made the scapegoat
of Philip's successes. In the dead of winter Francis, Duke
of Guise, the best French general, suddenly swooped on
Calais, whose tottering walls and scanty garrison were quite
unprepared to resist a siege. On 6th January      <note place="foot" n="16"> Loss of Calais,<date value="1558">1558</date>.</note>
<date value="1558">1558</date>, Calais was stormed, and a few days later
the fall of Guisnes completed the loss of the last lands
held in<placeName key="France">France</placeName> by the English crown, the last survival of
the glories of the Hundred Years' War. MeanwhilePaulIV.
and the Italian princes were utterly beaten, and Philip
became master of Italy as much as his father had ever
been. The furious old Pope revenged his defeat at the
hands of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> by turning savagely on Cardinal Pole, and
depriving him of his position as papal legate, on the ground
of his having once held views about justification by faith
not unlike those of Luther. By a strange irony, the man
who had devoted his life to the papal cause ended it under
the frown of the Pope.</p><p>
   9. Mary keenly felt the failure of her policy at home and
 abroad. She had lost Calais; she had made herself hated
 by her subjects; she had burnt the Protestants, and yet she
 was on bad terms with the Pope. She was racked by a
 mortal malady. More than all she felt her husband's coldness
 and cruelty. Yet sad as was her plight, she never
 lost her courage. "The queen," wrote Philip's   <note place="foot" n="17">Death of Mary and Pole,<date value="1558-11-17">17th and 18th Nov.1558</date></note>
 ambassador, "does all she can; her will is
 good, and her heart is stout, but everything
 else is wrong." In the autumn of
 <date value="1558">1558</date> she  was dying of dropsy. She made her will, leaving what
 money she had to the monks and friars, and magnanimously
 devoting her last moments to securing the succession of her
 sister. On 17th November she died and was buried, not in
 her robes of state, but in the garb of a nun. " When I am
 dead," she said to one of her ladies, "you shall find Calais
 lying upon my heart." Next day Cardinal Pole followed
 her to the grave.  Both were pious and well-meaning
 enthusiasts, and both died conscious that their life's work
 had been a failure.

 <p>   1. The daughter of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. and Anne Boleyn was
 just over five-and-twenty when the death of her sister
<note place="foot" n="1"> Character of Queen <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>.</note>
called her to the English throne, in accordance with
her father's will. She was above
 the middle height, with strong features, a broad brow, a
 great hooked nose, hazel eyes, fair complexion and masses
 of light auburn hair. She had a magnificent constitution,
 and seemed almost incapable of fatigue, working nearly
 as hard as her father at the business of ruling her kingdom
 yet always finding time for the endless frivolities of her
 court. She delighted in hunting, was proud of her skill in
 dancing, and was never weary of watching plays, masques,
 and shows. Nothing pleased her better than going on progress,
 visiting the houses of the nobles and gentry, and
 making herself popular with all classes. She was as careful
 as her father in upholding the ceremonial side of her
 office, and, like him, she was hearty, kindly, and affable
 when she was pleased, but terrible in her anger. With
 her father's kingly qualities came also a good deal of his
 coarseness and insensibility.  She had few scruples, was
 utterly regardless of the truth, and sometimes a touch of
 ferocity showed that she was Henry's true daughter. Even
 in smaller matters there was little that was womanly about
 her. She spoke freely, swore good round oaths, ate and
 drank heartily, kissed her friends if she were pleased, and
 beat them when she was angry. She was as self-centred
 as Henry himself, and if she did her best for her country,
 it was only because, with fine Tudor instinct, she could not
 separate its interests from  her own.  She had, like all
 Henry's children, been carefully educated.  Her schoolmaster,
 Roger Ascham, tells us that she spoke French and
 Italian as well as she talked English, that she was fluent
 in Latin, and had a fair knowledge of Greek. She wrote
 an exquisite hand, and was a good musician. But she had
 more information than culture; and her somewhat practical
 education did little to supply her lack of softness,
 imagination, and sympathy. She preferred action to reading, and
 was almost as much outside the wonderful literary
 movement that marked the end of her reign, as she was unaffected






                  <pb id="p.73" n="73"/>

by the deeper religious emotions of her age.  She was
at bottom a cold, clear-headed, far-seeing politician, without
sentiment or deep feeling, but strong, courageous, and
persistent, and well able by her regal bearing to inspire
enthusiasm to which she herself was a stranger. Yet there
was a lighter and more frivolous side to her nature, which
showed that there was something that she had inherited
from her mother. Her vanity was colossal, and no flattery
was too gross to be unacceptable to her. As she grew old,
she concealed the ravages of time by paint, false hair, and
gorgeous millinery, setting herself off with many-coloured
dresses of barbaric design, and delighting in wearing
monstrous farthingales, and towering ruffs, "supposing
haply that the eyes of her people (being dazzled by the
glittering aspect of those her outward adornments) would
not so easily discover the marks of age and the decay of
natural beauty." She was very undecided, especially in
little matters, and in writing and speaking she affected an
obscure style "that she might not write in such phrases as
were commonly used." But however hard it seemed for her
to make up her mind, she showed rare constancy of purpose
in pursuing for nearly forty-five years the policy that she had
marked out for herself at the beginning of her reign. She
had no near kinsfolk and few real friends, and was too
greedy of power to share it with any one, even with a
husband, so that, though few queens were more faithfully
served, she grew terribly lonely in her old age. She was
excessively mean and parsimonious, knowing that she
could only keep herself independent of her Parliaments by
carefully husbanding her resources.  She was shrewd
enough to use her little vanities to conceal the strength of
her purpose and the force of her will. But those have
much misread her character who have made <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> a
weak queen, aimlessly swayed by conflicting impulses, and
only kept to high resolves by the unflinching self-sacrifice
of her advisers.</p><p>
  2. <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> had a great admiration for her father, and
her real ambition was to follow as closely as possible in his
footsteps.  Like her father, she kept her                          <note place="foot" n="2"> <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s statesmen and courtiers.</note>
ministers as long as they were useful, and, as
she never changed her policy as Henry did, or
sent off the exponents of a former phase of feeling to the
block, her statesmen grew grey and died in her service.
Though she was niggardly in assigning rewards or honours
to her most trusted helpers, and utterly unscrupulous







<pb id="p.74" n="74"/>                 <note place="foot" n="3"> [<date value="1558">1558</date>--<date value="1603">1603</date>.]</note>

in making them the scapegoats of her risky or unpopular
acts, she clave to them with strange fidelity. Sir William
<note place="foot" n="4">William Cecil,<dateRange from="1520" to="1598">1520-1598.</dateRange></note>
Cecil, who had already done good service to
             both Edward and Mary, was her Secretary of
State from her accession to <date value="1572">1572</date>, from which date to his
death, in <date value="1598">1598</date>, he acted as Lord Treasurer of England.
He is the typical statesman of her reign, shrewd, cautious,
methodical, and wise, with nothing heroic about him,
but prudently ruling both his own household and the
realm of England, always quietly striving to screw up the
hesitating queen to take up a more defiant and Protestant
policy, but ever faithful to the state and uncorrupted by
gifts, steering the crooked and devious policy of his mistress
with admirable dexterity, simplicity, and cheerfulness,
and receiving no higher reward than the barony of
Burghley, which made him "the poorest lord in England."
<note place="foot" n="5">Sir Nicholas Bacon, <dateRange from="1509" to="1579">1509-1579</dateRange></note>
His brother-in-law, Sir Nicholas Bacon, "a
plain man, direct and constant," was Lord
 Keeper of the Great Sealfrom <date value="1558">1558</date> to his death
in <date value="1579">1579</date>, without so much as receiving the higher dignity

Office went almost by heredity, Sir Robert

before his father's death, and taking as prominent a
position in the queen's declining years as William Cecil
had done in an earlier generation. Another chief helper
of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> was Sir Francis Walsingham, Secretary from

 dexterous and insinuating of politicians, whose

enemies, and who, for all his unswerving and unscrupulous
devotion, died so poor that he left hardly enough to pay
for his funeral.</p><p>
  Beyond the small circle of plain and unostentatious
workers, stood the great ring of courtiers who amused
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s leisure and glorified her beauty and wisdom.
To this motley crew she showed a liberality never manifested
towards her responsible advisers. Many were mere pleasure-seekers;
others intrigued against the ministers and upheld
the King of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> or hardly concealed their sympathy with
the Catholics, while others, like Lord Robert Dudley, were

<note place="foot" n="8">Robert Dudley,EarlofLeicester,<dateRange from="1532" to="1588">1532-1588</dateRange>.</note>
ostentatious patrons of extreme Protestantism,
though there was little that was Puritan in
their life or manners. Robert Dudley, younger
son of the wretched Duke of Northumberland, was conspicuous






              <pb id="p.75" n="75"/>

 for his goodly person, showy dress, and skill in
the tactics of a courtier. He was about <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s own
age and her greatest friend. She called him her "sweet
Robin," made him Earl of Leicester, and would have
married him, had she not resolved to live and rule alone.
Though not without ability, he was a worthless fellow, gluttonous,
cruel, overbearing, and vain, and believed, on suggestive
but insufficient evidence, to have murdered his first
wife, Amy Robsart, that he might be free to marry the queen.
Down to his death in <date value="1588">1588</date>, the queen never altogether
lost her affection for him, and marred at least one of her
boldest enterprises by entrusting it to his incompetent hands.
</p><p>  3. The utter failure of the reigns of her brother and sister
could not but convince <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> of the excellence of the
middle way which <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. had so reso-                                  <note place="foot" n="9"><persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> and the Via Media Anglicana.</note>
utely pursued. Her first great care was to
apply it to the settlement of religion. Though
she had cheerfully attended Mass under Mary, she was
known to be disaffected to her sister's policy, and a swarm
of Protestant exiles, driven away by Mary's persecution, had
now hurried back to England clamouring for a reformation
more thoroughgoing and complete than even that of Edward
VI. At the same time the ministers and bishops of Mary
were still in power, and any sudden change must at once
excite their hostility. <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> thus stood in a very difficult
position, but she was shrewd enough to steer her way
round the many quicksands and reefs that beset her. She
had no decided personal feelings to warp her judgment.
She had very little religious sentiment, and cared nothing
for the theology of the rival churches, though she loved a
stately worship and reverenced ancient forms.  Candles
gleamed and a silver crucifix glittered on her chapel altar,
and until Parliament altered the law, she upheld the Mass
as the legal service of the realm. But she had a strong
English feeling, and strove to rise above the sectional
policy of the last two reigns, and re-establish religion on a
broad national basis, reforming so far as would give some
satisfaction to the reformers, but retaining so much of the
old as would encourage the lovers of old ways.</p><p>
   4. If <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> had been left to herself, she would probably
   have brought things back to the state they were in in
 <date value="1547">1547</date>, or in the first year of Mary's reign. But
 <note place="foot" n="10">The Parliament of <date value="1559">1559</date>.</note>
 a national church with the Mass and the Six
 Articles, but without the Pope, was not at the moment practicable.
 Christendom was hopelessly divided between the

Roman and anti-Roman camps; and though most plain
Englishmen would have preferred King Henry's policy,
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> saw that the papal party could only be fought
with the help of the Protestants, and that their support
was only to be obtained by going back largely to the
system of <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>. Finding Convocation opposed to
all change, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> at once had recourse to the Commons.
In January <date value="1559">1559</date>, her first Parliament met, and despite the
unanimous opposition of the bishops, passed new Acts of
Supremacy and Uniformity.</p><p>

   The Act of Supremacy of <date value="1559">1559</date> was styled an "act restoring to the
 Crown the ancient jurisdiction over the state, ecclesiastical and
                                     spiritual, and abolishing all foreign power repugnant
<note place="foot" n="12"> The Act of Supremacy  <date value="1559">1559</date>. </note>
 to the same." It renounced the papal jurisdiction as
    emphatically as the Act of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>., but it dropped
 the title of Supreme Head of the Church, which had proved so
 offensive to ecclesiastical sentiment, and described the queen as the
 "only Supreme Governor of this Realm, as well in all spiritual or
 ecclesiastical things or causes as temporal." The Oath of Supremacy
 imposed by the act was to be taken by all ecclesiastics, all temporal
 officers and by all graduates of the universities, and the penalty for
 upholding foreign jurisdiction was, on the third offence, the death of
 a traitor. A royal proclamation further admonished "simple men,"
 that the queen only claimed such authority " as anciently belonged to
 the crown," and did not "challenge power of ministry of divine
 service," i.e. distinctly clerical power.
 By the Act of Uniformity of <date value="1559">1559</date>, the Second Prayer Book of
 <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>. was in substance restored, as the only lawful form of
<note place="foot" n="13"> The Act of Uniformity  <date value="1559">1559</date>.</note>
 church service.  Several significant alterations were
   however made, calculated to disarm resistance, like
the modifications in the Act of Supremacy. The most
important change was the one that ordered that both the forms
employed in the two Prayer Books of <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>. in the administration
of the Communion should be amalgamated so that both the
Zwinglian and the traditional views of the Eucharist might seem to be
allowed. An offensive petition in the Litany, praying for deliverance
from the "Bishop of Rome and all his detestable enormities" was also
omitted : while the famous Ornaments Rubric was added, enjoining
that " all ornaments of the Church and of the ministers thereof shall
be retained as were in the Church of England by authority of Parliament
in the second year of <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>., until other order shall be
taken by the Queen's Majesty."</p><p>
  By other acts of the same Parliaments, the queen's title to the crown
was recognised, First Fruits and Tenths restored to the Crown, and
the monasteries, restored by Mary, suppressed. It is significant that no
proposals were at once made to bring hack a Protestant system  of
doctrine by reviving <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>.'s Forty-Two Articles, or that draft code
of Protestant Canon Law, the Reformatio Legum Ecclesiasticarum.
</p><p>
  5. By these broad measures <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> restored Protestantism in England.
  But the Elizabethan Settlement,






            <pb id="p.77" n="77"/>

though clothed for the most part in the forms of Edward
VI., was inspired by the spirit of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>., rather than
that of Somerset or Northumberland. Under                  <note place="foot" n="14">General character of the Elizabethan religious Settlement</note>
Edward there had been constant changes,
but no finality. No one knew what would
go next, and everything seemed unsettled.
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> now took Edward's system, and, making
important modifications in it, set up what had been but a
temporary halting-stage, in a time of unending change,
as a final and permanent constitution for the English
Church. Henceforth the queen's policy was simple.  She
had fixed the form of the Church, and had now to enforce
obedience to it. With all its Protestant trappings, it was
the Vita Media of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. over again, with a stately
Liturgy, the traditional form of episcopal government, and
the aspiration after continuity with earlier times. But it
was the settlement of a statesman, not of a churchman.
The most religious people in the country were either
Romanists or Calvinists, and disliked it.  Such a politic
compromise could inspire little enthusiasm.  Nevertheless
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> upheld her policy with admirable courage
and consistency. Though not wholly pleasing to her most
active subjects, it interpreted pretty faithfully the wishes of
the inert and easy-going majority, who were well content with
her position. Before <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> died, she had the gratification
of knowing that her settlement was accepted by the
great mass of her people, and that the Elizabethan Via
Media had power to excite religious zeal and spiritual
emotion, as real and effective as the extremes which at
one time seemed to attract all enthusiasts to them. And
after her death her spirit lived on, so that the Elizabethan
  Settlement, which even the armed Puritanism of the seventeenth
  century could not finally overcome, remained, and
  remains, under many changes of government, and many
  fluctuations of religious feeling, the ordered form of the
  Church of England.</p><p>
    6. The settlement had been steadily opposed by the
  clergy, headed by the bishops. It was with difficulty that
  <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> had found a prelate willing to crown              <note place="foot" n="15">The oldand the new bishops.</note>
  her, and all the bishops, with one exception,
  refused the Oath of Supremacy, and were deprived of their
  sees. In most cases they spent the end of their lives in
  prison, like Bishop Bonner, though some escaped to the
  Continent, while others were released by the clemency of
  the new government. <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s course had been made





<pb id="p.78" n="78"/>    <note place="foot" n="16"> [<date value="1555">1555</date>--<date value="1559">1559</date>.]</note>

  easier by the death of Cardinal Pole leaving the see of
  Canterbury vacant.  In September <date value="1559">1559</date>, she chose as
 <note place="foot" n="17">Archbishop Parker,<dateRange from="1559" to="1575">1559-1575</dateRange>. </note>
 his successor Matthew Parker, a learned
 Cambridge scholar, who had been Dean of
 Lincoln under <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>., and, when deprived as a
  married man under Mary, had preferred to live quietly in
  England to escaping to the Continent with the advanced
  reformers. He was a grave, wise, and sober man, a great
  student of the Fathers, and a lover of the Middle Ages,
  a bountiful patron of scholars, and a liberal benefactor of his
  university, delighting in collecting old manuscripts, editing
  chronicles and writing on the ecclesiastical antiquities of
  Britain. Parker, like <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, looked on things from a
  purely English stand-point, and, after the queen, he was at
  first almost the only prominent upholder of the middle way.
  Down to his death in <date value="1575">1575</date>, he laboured with great energy
  and tact in seeing that the Elizabethan Settlement was made
  a reality. The queen showed more confidence in him than
  in her other prelates, though all his exertions could not prevent
  her appropriating ecclesiastical property, bullying the
  bishops, and generally ruling the Church with almost as
  <note place="foot" n="18">The High Commission Court, <date value="1559">1559</date>.</note>
  high a hand as Henry himself. In <date value="1559">1559</date>,
            <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> set up a permanent Court of Ecclesiastical
            Commission, or High Commission Court, which was
  empowered to exercise on her behalf her supremacy over
the Church. Parker was first on the commission, and the
new court gave him and his mistress the means of enforcing the law.</p><p>
  7. At first Parker found little difficulty in dealing with
the avowed friends of the Pope. They were few in number
<note place="foot" n="19">Parker and the Roman Catholics. </note>
and destitute of leaders. The main difficulties
  he had to face were with the disloyal and
careless who inclined to the old school, and with the
hasty and zealous champions of a more thorough reformation
than <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> had permitted. A mere handful of
Queen Mary's clergy had followed the example of the
bishops, and given up their livings. The great majority
remained on, reading the Prayer Book instead of the Mass,
but showing in their sluggish fashion no love for new ways,
and a great horror of Protestant heresy. Among the laity,
even avowed Catholics largely conformed and attended the
English services. Parker did what he could to impress his
opinions upon this inert mass. Here time was his greatest
friend, for it replaced the lukewarm by better-educated and
more active friends of the New Faith. The real problem






                            <pb id="p.79" n="79"/>

was that while the old-fashioned clergy were only passively
hostile, the ardent Protestants were fiercely opposed to
the policy of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>.
</p><p>
  8. The chief trouble was with the returned exiles from <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>
and Switzerland.  When driven abroad for their devotion to their
faith, they had found but a cold welcome from the stiff
and pedantic Lutherans, but had been warmly received                                  <note place="foot" n="20"> The MarianExiles and Calvinism</note>
by the great French Protestant, John Calvin, who up
to his death in <date value="1564">1564</date> reigned like  a despot over both
Church and State in the free city of Geneva. He had there set up a
model church with clearly-defined and rigid doctrines, that taught that
God was a stern just task-master as inexorable as nature, and dealing
out salvation and reprobation in accordance with His predestined
decrees. Side by side with this dogmatic system, which was called
Calvinism, he had established a system of church-organisation and
discipline as rigid and inexorable as the gospel which he expounded.
Rejecting the office of bishops, he made presbyters all of one order,
though some, the ministers, were set apart to teach and preach, and
others, the elders, simply to bear rule. Individual congregations were
joined together into larger aggregations, and, over each of these, councils,
called synods and presbyteries, held authority. This system was
called Presbyterianism. Calvin's churches worshipped God with the
utmost simplicity, rejecting all forms and ordinances they did not find
in the New Testament. The Church dominated the State as strictly
as the church of Hildebrand or Becket had ruled the kingdoms of
the Middle Ages, and enforced a strict moral discipline over the whole
community. From their profession of purity in life, doctrine, and
worship the English followers of this school were called Puritans.
</p><p>
   9. The influence of Calvin convinced the English exiles
that even the system they had accepted under <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>.
was far removed from apostolic purity. In                    <note place="foot" n="21">The Troubles of Frankfurt, <date value="1555">1555</date>.</note>
some of their churches they scrupled to read
<persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>.'s Prayer Book, and the famous dispute known
as the Troubles of Frankfurt broke their little band into
hostile camps, of which the larger and more energetic was
opposed to the use of the English Liturgy. On their
return <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> gave bishoprics to the leaders of the more
moderate party, such as John Jewel, made                    <note place="foot" n="22">The Puritan Bishops.</note>
Bishop of Salisbury, and Edmund Grindal,
who succeeded Bonner at London.        Even these moderate
men were Calvinist in doctrine, and had little love for the
forms and ceremonies that delighted <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> and Parker.
The more extreme section of the exiles re-                    <note place="foot" n="23"><persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> and the Puritans.</note>
garded the Elizabethan church as little better
than the Roman, and merely gave an unwilling allegiance
to it because they hoped that, as in Edward's days, fresh






<pb id="p.80" n="80"/>    <note place="foot" n="24">[<date value="1559">1559</date>--<date value="1588">1588</date>.] </note>

  changes would quickly follow, until the English Church
  became just like the Church of Geneva.</p><p>
    It was only from this energetic, high-minded, but narrow
 and intolerant band that the English Church could derive
 sufficient active teachers and preachers to wage war against
 Rome. But they were very unfit agents for carrying out
 <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s ideas. Their very activity led to incessant
 religious controversy. Their scruples made them refuse to
 wear surplices or conform to the ceremonies enjoined by
 the Prayer Book. Instead of thinking and teaching as
 <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> ordered them, they obstinately insisted on thinking
 for themselves. It was in vain that the queen and her
 archbishop tried to reduce their unruly spirits to order.
  </p><p> In the sixteenth century everybody believed that the true
 Church must be one, and that all men must be forced to
 belong to it.  <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> prided herself on her liberality
 when she allowed people what she called "liberty of conscience,"
 which meant that she permitted them to think as
 they liked, as long as they went to church every Sunday
 and did not attack the established system. Moreover, no
 party would have been content with toleration, each one
 wished to dominate. If a few Roman Catholics withdrew
 from <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s church and held services of their own,
 the Puritans did not as yet aspire to follow their example,
 being warned by Calvin himself that though the Common
 Prayer "contained much that was antiquated and foolish,"
 yet they were bound to accept it and hope for better times.
</p><p>  For the first few years of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s reign the Puritans
had it all their own way. The ceremonies which they hated
<note place="foot" n="25">The Thirty-nine Articles, <date value="1563">1563</date>. </note>
were seldom enforced, and they so far prevailed
in Convocation that that body pressed
for the restoration of King Edward's Articles. In <date value="1563">1563</date> these
Articles were reduced to thirty-nine in number and carefully
revised with a view to making them less offensive to
friends of the old faith. <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> did her best to prevent
their acceptance by Parliament, and it was not till <date value="1571">1571</date>
that she allowed the bill which forced the clergy to subscribe
to them. Before this period the steady repression of
Puritanism had begun. In <date value="1565">1565</date> Parker issued a series of
<note place="foot" n="26">Parker's Advertisements. </note>
directions to the clergy called Parker's Advertisements,
which ordered that the minister in
all parish churches should wear "a comely surplice with
sleeves," and insisted on a stricter observance of the forms
enjoined by the Act of Uniformity. The Advertisements
did not change but rather relaxed the existing law, and






               <pb id="p.81" n="81"/>

<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> with characteristic caution never gave a formal
assent to them. Nevertheless, they were received with a
storm of protest from the Puritan clergy. However, the
ceremonies were rigidly enforced, and in <date value="1566">1566</date> about thirty
London clergymen were deprived of their benefices for
their obstinate refusal to wear the prescribed vestments.
Persecution embittered the struggle, and before long the
ardent Puritans shifted the ground of their attack. Instead
of simply rejecting vestments and ceremonies, they condemned
the whole episcopal system and demanded that the
Church of England should be made Presbyterian like the
Church of Geneva. In <date value="1572">1572</date> Thomas Cartwright, who had
been expelled for his Puritan views from his professorship
of divinity at Cambridge, gave voice to this opinion. He
took up and defended a book called An Ad-
<note place="foot" n="27">The Admonition to the Parliament, <date value="1572">1572</date>.</note>
monition to Parliament, written by two of his
friends, and supplemented it by a Second
Admonition, in which he denounced the Prayer Book as
"an unperfect book, picked out of that popish dung-hill the
Mass Book," and declared that the episcopal system was
"Anti-Christian and devilish and contraryto the Scriptures."
</p><p>  10. Parker died in <date value="1575">1575</date>, and
Edmund Grindal his successor was friendly to the moderate Puritans.  He soon
came into conflict with the queen by refusing
<note place="foot" n="28">Archbishop Grindal,<dateRange from="1576" to="1583">1576-1583</dateRange>.</note>
to put down clerical meetings for the discussion
of the Scriptures called Prophesyings.
The Puritans approved of these assemblies as "a notable
spur unto all the ministers to apply to their books, which
otherwise would give themselves to hawking, hunting,
cards, tippling at the ale-house, and other such-like
vanities."  <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, however, hated these
<note place="foot" n="29">The Prophesyings suppressed.</note>
discussions as leading to divisions and disorders,
and peremptorily ordered the archbishop to stop
them. On Grindal's refusing, he was suspended from his
functions, and died in <date value="1583">1583</date> in disgrace.
 </p><p> 11. <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> chose as her next archbishop John Whitgift,
 an old rival of Cartwright's at Cambridge, who, though
a zealous Calvinist, strenuously upheld the
<note place="foot" n="30"> Archbihop Whitgift,<dateRange from="1583" to="1604"> 1583-1604</dateRange>.</note>
ceremonies, and through the High Commission
 Court dealt with the Puritans with great
severity. He defeated the attempt of Cartwright
to superimpose the Genevan system on the English
<note place="foot" n="31">The Martin MarprelateTracts, <date value="1588">1588</date>.</note>
Church, and was fiercely attacked by the
Puritans in what are called the Martin Marprelate
Tracts, in which the episcopal system was denounced








<pb id="p.82" n="82"/>            <note place="foot" n="32">[<date value="1593">1593</date>--<date value="1603">1603</date>.]</note>

with extraordinary violence. In <date value="1593">1593</date> John Penry, a fanatical
Welshman, who was convicted of having a large share
<note place="foot" n="33">Death of Penry,<date value="1593">1593</date>.</note>
in writing these tracts, was executed for libel
        and for inciting rebellion. Penry was an honest
enthusiast who made a noble end. A popular rime
showed the bitterness of the conservative North against
his teaching:
                 <quote rend="blockquote">"The Welshman is hanged
                   Who at our kirk flanged,
                   And at her state banged;
                 And burnt are his books ;
                   And though he be hanged,
                   Yet he is not wranged
                   The deil has him fanged [taken]
                 In his crooked clooks." [claws]
</quote></p><p>
  12. Despite persecution, the mass of the Puritans remained
  discontented conformists, or became what were
called Nonconformists, that is, they found devices for
remaining in the Church without conforming to the cere<note
place="foot" n="3">The Brownists and thebeginnings of Protestant dissent </note>
monies, still believing that Presbyterianism
 was the better way. A few of the bolder
spirits broke from the Church altogether,
 and learnt from their leader, Robert Brown,
 a distant kinsman of the Cecils, that the
"kingdom of God was not to be begun by whole parishes,
but rather by the worthiest, be they never so few," and
that "the people of every parish ought to choose their
bishop, and that the precise who refuse the ceremonies and
yet preach in the Church strain at a gnat and swallow a
camel, and are hypocrites like Master Cartwright." They
set up particular congregations of their own and maintained
that each of these was a separate self-governing Christian
church. They denounced all national organisation of religion,
and said that the magistrates ought to have no
concern with the Church. They were the first Protestant
Dissenters, and gradually got the name of Independents,
because of their theory that each congregation should form
a church by itself.  They were also called Brownists
from their first leader, and Sectaries or Separatists, because
they formed distinct sects, which openly separated from
the communion of the Church. But they were very few
and were bitterly persecuted. Even harder was the lot of
the Anabaptists, mainly fugitives from the Continent, who
took their name from their belief that those christened as
infants ought to be baptized over again as adults. These






              <pb id="p.83" n="83"/>

were the Protestant extremists, and were disliked, not only
for their religious, but also for their civil and social
doctrines which led to Socialism. Several Anabaptists
were burnt as heretics during this reign. Parliament,
though sympathising with the moderate Puritans, emphatically
showed its dislike of the Separatists by passing, in
<date value="1593">1593</date>, an act which punished with banishment and death
"frequenters of conventicles and seditious sectaries."
 </p><p> 13. The faint beginnings of Independency and the continued
 discontent of the Puritans within the Church showed
that a united Protestantism was an impossible
<note place="foot" n="34">Beginnings of Anglican theology.</note>
 dream. Before the end of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s
reign, a new school of divines had grown up, whose teach
ing tended to draw a deeper line between
<note place="foot" n="35"> Hooker's EcclesiasticalPolity, <date value="1593">1593</date>.</note>
Churchmen and Puritans. The greatest of
these was Richard Hooker, Master of the Temple, who
published in <date value="1593">1593</date> his famous book on the Laws of
Ecclesiastical Polity, in which, in stately and noble prose,
he defended the Church-system against the Puritans, by
showing that practices sanctioned by long use, and beautiful
and seemly in themselves, were not to be rejected
because they were not directly enjoined in the Scriptures,
since the law of God was to be sought, not only in the precepts
of the Bible, but also in the natural laws of heaven and
earth. Before long, some went further than Hooker, and
taught that a church without bishops was no church at
all. The policy of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> had triumphed, though at
great cost. The great mass of the population was heartily
attached to her Church. Yet, with all their narrowness,
the Puritans, whom she persecuted, were among the
staunchest and most upright of her subjects, and their expulsion
deprived the Church of much that was strong and
high-minded. However, the strife between <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> and the
Puritans was no mere contest about names and forms, but
involved the whole question of the future of the Church.
It was only through the strenuous and often violent warfare,
which <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> and her bishops waged against the
Puritans, that the Church of England remained different
from the Church of Geneva.</p><p>
  14. While <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> thus successfully combated
Genevan ideals in England, the violent outbreak of the
long-deferred Reformation of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> testified                  <note place="foot" n="36"> Beginnings of the Reformation in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>.</note>
 to the full force of Calvin's influence.
Since the little Queen Mary had been sent to
France for her education, her mother, Mary of Guise, the






<pb id="p.84" n="84"/>       <note place="foot" n="37">  [<date value="1549">1549</date>--<date value="1560">1560</date>.]</note>

sister of the conqueror of Calais, Duke Francis of Guise,
had striven to uphold a French and Catholic policy in
<placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, where the inordinate wealth of the bishops and
abbots powerfully attracted the cupidity of a poor and
unscrupulous nobility, while the Church, with its carelessness
and corruption, had utterly lost hold over the
people. Mary of Guise kept back the reforming tide for
many years, but the only result of her careful policy was
to make the inevitable flood more overwhelming and
destructive. In the evil days that followed the capture
of St. Andrews, and the battle of Pinkie, the first
leaders of Scottish Protestantism had sought refuge in
<note place="foot" n="38">Character and early history of John Knox, <dateRange from="1505" to="1572">1505-1572</dateRange></note>                                                England. Among them was a priest named
John Knox, the son of a poor burgher of
Haddington, who, when more than forty years
of age, had thrown in his lot with the reformers, and
joined the murderers of Beaton at St. Andrews, glorifying
their "godly act," though he had had no part in it. In
his fervid sermons he taught the defenders of the castle,
that "the Pope was Anti-Christ, the Mass an abominable
idolatry, and that there was no Purgatory." When the
French took the castle, he was sent as a galley-slave to
France, whence he escaped to England in <date value="1549">1549</date>. There he
became a popular preacher of extreme Protestantism, and
one of King Edward's chaplains, refusing a bishopric, and
drawing up, as was believed, the Black Rubric of Edward's
Second Prayer Book, which explains that kneeling at
the Communion involves no adoration of the elements.
On Edward's death he fled to Geneva, where he became
an ardent disciple of Calvin, and thence went to Frankfurt
as minister of the English exiles in that city. His
refusal to read Edward's Prayer Book led to the troubles
that split in twain the exiled congregation.  Indignant at
the persecution which the two Marys were dealing out to
the Protestants of England and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, he wrote a wild
denunciation of all female rule, in his Blast of the Trumpet
against the Monstrous Regiment of Women. On Mary's
death he sought to return to England, but <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
stopped the way, and Knox lamented that his "Blast
hath blown from me all my friends in England." In <date value="1559">1559</date>
he boldly returned to <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, where Rome was still
ascendant. From that moment, until his death in <date value="1572">1572</date>, he
devoted all his masterful energy and unconquerable will
to the establishment of a Genevan reformation in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>.
Stern, hard and rigid, a cruel bigot, and a fierce reckless

partisan, he redeemed his narrower qualities by his highsouled
unselfishness, his absolute straightforwardness, and
his utter fearlessness. He was the only great man among
all the reformers that spoke theEnglish tongue. He stamped
the deep impress of his character on all future history of
the Scottish people, who rightly admire him as the chief
creator of Modern <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, He brought with him the
last and the greatest fruit of the close connection between
<placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> and<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, when he set up in his native land the
complete and logical structure of French Protestantism.
But he was the first Scot to see that the Reformation had
ended the old alliance of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> and<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, and the
first Scot to welcome a close union with the English, as the
only means of securing the reforming cause in his own
country. His policy triumphed when, at <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s death,
the union of the English and Scottish crowns, which Henry
VIII. had thought impossible, was peacefully accomplished,
and it triumphed even more signally, when in the next
century the Puritans of England, with Scottish help, almost
succeeded in destroying <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s Reformation Settlement
and in uniting the two churches, as well as the two states.
   15. About the time of Knox's return, the Scots nobles</p><p>
 had formed a league against the bishops.  Under the
 leadership of the Lords of the Congregation-   <note place="foot" n="39"> The Lords of the Congregation and Mary of Guise, <dateRange from="1551" to="1560">1551-1560</dateRange></note>
 this was the name given to them-the Scots
 people exhausted their pent-up fury against
 the old Church. The Mass was put down;
 churches and monasteries were burnt to the ground, and
 the lands of the Church appropriated by the victorious
 nobles. Mary of Guise, though broken in health and
 spirits, struggled hard against the rebels, and, obtaining
 help from<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, she soon made such a brave show, that
 the Lords of the Congregation were forced to appeal to
 <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> for assistance.</p><p>
   The English queen was in a difficulty. She hated rebels,
 and believed that any ruler had the right to make his
 subjects worship in his own way. Moreover,                   <note place="foot" n="40"><persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>helps theScots, <date value="1560">1560</date>.</note>
 she detested the author of the Blast against
 the Regiment of Women, and feared lest the establishment
 of Calvinism in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> might unduly encourage her
 English Puritans.  But there was an obvious political
 advantage in detaching the Scots from<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and the
 Papacy, and her ministers, stronger Protestants than
 she was herself, did not fail to press this on her.
 At last her interests got the better of her principles, and







<pb id="p.86" n="86"/>         <note place="foot" n="41">  [<date value="1560">1560</date>--<date value="1561">1561</date>.]</note>

early in <date value="1560">1560</date> she sent a fleet to <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, though she still
professed to look with disfavour on the Scots rebels. The
English joined hands with the Lords of the Congregation,
shut up the French in Leith, and straitly besieged it.
<note place="foot" n="42">The deathof Mary of Guise, and the Treaty of Edinburgh.</note>
In June the heroic regent died ; and with her
 perished the best hopes of the French and
Catholic cause in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. Next month the
defenders of Leith signed the Treaty of Edinburgh,
by which both the English and the French troops
were to quit <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>.</p><p>
  16. The Scottish Protestants profited by the absence
of settled government to complete the work of reformation.
In August <date value="1560">1560</date>, the Scottish Parliament met, and at once
<note place="foot" n="43">Establishment of Presbyterianism in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, <date value="1560">1560</date>.</note>
abolished the power of the Pope, and imposed
the penalty of death on all who for a
third time celebrated or attended " the idolatry
of the Mass."  It accepted a body of Calvinistic doctrine
which Knox had rapidly drawn up, and empowered
him to draw up a scheme for discipline and Church organisation.
The result was Knox's First Book of Discipline,
which set up the Presbyterian system with its parity of all
ministers, and its rigid system of councils and synods, culminating
in the General Assembly of the whole church in a
single representative ecclesiastical Parliament, which soon
reduced all <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> to dependence on the Kirk. He
also brought in the bare and austere worship of Geneva.
The nobles rejected Knox's further scheme for devoting all
the ancient ecclesiastical revenues to the maintenance of
the new ministers, the relief of the poor, and the setting up
a system  of parish schools, that the whole population
might be taught God's Word.  The Protestant lords kept
a tight hold of the monastery lands which they had seized,
and even insisted on keeping up nominal bishops, who
might continue as the formal possessors of those Church
lands which they were not strong enough to seize outright.
They let Knox do what he liked in regard to doctrine and
discipline; but he found it hard to secure for his new
clergy a bare subsistence from teinds or tithes. All his
other proposals were carried out. Though the absent Queen
Mary vouchsafed no assent either to the Treaty of Edinburgh
or to the acts of the reforming Parliament, no heed
was paid to her action.  <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> had become for all
practical purposes a Calvinistic Republic.</p><p>
  17. Thus was the Scottish Reformation accomplished in
these very years in which the English Reformation assumed





           <pb id="p.87" n="87"/>

its final form. Never were two movements more strongly
contrasted.  The greediness of the nobles for Church
lands is almost the only feature that is comon to them.
In England the Reformation      <note place="foot" n="44">Contrast betweenthe English and Scottish  Reformation</note>
had been carried out by a despotic sovereign,
and was political, hesitating, compromising,
half-hearted, and imposed on a reluctant and indifferent
nation by royal authority. But, being the work of the
state, it became a national movement, so moderately and
judiciously conducted as to keep the reformed church
in touch with the best traditions of the ancient ecclesiastical
system. Like most English revolutions, it was
carried out piecemeal and slowly, with the result that
the old and the new ran so imperceptibly into each other
that it was hard to say where began the break of continuity,
if there were a break at all. In <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> the
Reformation came as a revolution imposed on a reluctant
sovereign by rebel nobles and fiery ministers.  The
Reformers prided themselves on digging a deep trench
of separation between their own perfect system and "the
blind old days of Papistry." Every vestige of the past was
swept away. The fate of the ruined abbeys of England
was meted out to nearly every great church in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>,
and every wave of religious enthusiasm was marked by the
destruction of some ancient shrine by "the rascal multitude,"
which thought thus to carry out the teaching of Knox
himself. The Scots Reformation was systematic, logical,
thoroughgoing, and destructive.  In time it became a
movement even more intensely national than its English
parallel.  But the modern Scots nation was itself the
creation of the Reformation, while the English nation
shaped the course of the English movement to its own
likeness. Yet different as were the two events, common
Protestantism soon brought the two nations together, and
the Great Britain of modern times must honour Knox and
his companions, as well as <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. and his great
daughter, among its founders.</p><p>
  18. While Knox and the Congregation were utterly
destroying the ancient <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, its young queen grew up
to womanhood as a Catholic and a Frenchwoman.
<note place="foot" n="45"> Character and early history ofMary Queen ofScots, <dateRange from="1542" to="1561">1542 -1561</dateRange></note>
 She had been carefully brought up,
among the royal children of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, and
knew Latin, Greek and Italian, though she
was studiously kept from any knowledge of
the English tongue either in its northern or southern form.






<pb id="p.88" n="88"/>           <note place="foot" n="46"> [<date value="1560">1560</date>--<date value="1561">1561</date>.]</note>

She was well instructed in poetry and literature, and sang
well, accompanying herself on the lute.  Her famous
beauty consisted, not so much in any exceptional regularity
of features, as in the extraordinary brilliancy of her colour
and the exquisite grace and charm of her manner.
She was tall and well made, was as strong as a man and
enjoyed perfect health. Her brow was broad and ample,
her chin square and fully developed; her eyelids were
heavy, and her lips were commonly closely compressed;
her hair was of that shade of brown which ripples like gold in
the sun, and her hazel eyes were clear and bright. Though
brought up amid the luxury and corruption of the Valois
Court, her personal habits were of the simplest.  She
delighted in hunting, hawking, and in open-air life; and
wished that she was a man " to know what life it was to lie
all night in the field, or to walk on the causeway with a
buckler and broadsword." Yet at times she would lounge
idly in bed all day, only rising at night for a ball or a revel.
Naturally hot-tempered and outspoken, she learnt to discipline
her emotions to obey her strong will, so that, save
in the one supreme crisis of her life, she hardly allowed
herself to be dominated by her passions. "She seemeth,"
wrote an observant opponent, "to regard no ceremonious
honour besides the acknowledgment of her estate royal.
She showeth a disposition to speak much, to be bold, to be
pleasant, to be very familiar. She showeth a great desire
to be revenged on her enemies, and readiness to expose
herself to all perils in hope of victory. She desireth much
to hear of hardiness and valiancy, commending by name
all approved hardy men, although they be her enemies.
The thing she most thirsteth after is victory, so that for
victory's sake pain and peril seem pleasant to her. Surely
she is a rare woman; for as no flattery can lightly abuse
her, so no plain speech seemeth to offend her."  It is
the fashion to contrast the graceful, beautiful, passionate
Queen of Scots with the astute, cold, cruel <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>.
But, in truth, there were more points of comparison
than contrast between their real dispositions.  Mary
was as hard, as unscrupulous, and as cruel as her great
rival. As with <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, ambition and love of power were
her great motive forces. Both allowed caprice and wilfulness
to impair the results of their wonted tact and caution,
though in this respect the deeper, more womanly nature of
Mary, brought up in a more tropical and unhealthy atmosphere
and exposed to worse difficulties and more real






              <pb id="p.89" n="89"/>

temptations, was less controlled by the dictates of her policy,
and she never worked so hard, or showed such persistent
tact, as <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. Neither did she ever identify herself
with her people as did the English queen. Like <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>,
Mary was born the leader of a religious party, and yet
few women of the time, except <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, had less real
religious feeling.  But Mary, though driven, more than
once, to open dissembling, was unswervingly faithful to
the Catholic cause, upholding the traditional faith as
a good soldier maintains against the enemy a strong
position entrusted to his charge. As a mere girl, she
struggled hard to obtain ascendency over her wretched
husband, Francis II., that through him she and her mother's
kinsfolk might rule<placeName key="France">France</placeName>. Driven from her early home
by his death, she heroically strove to undo the work of the
Reformation in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, and sacrificed her domestic happiness
to the prospect of leading the Romanists of England.
In her efforts to carry out these impossible tasks, she knew
how to win loyal and enthusiastic support, and incurred
many bitter and unscrupulous enmities. The real Mary
Stuart is neither the suffering saint of her worshippers, nor
the graceful tigress of her foes, but a strong, vigorous,
hard-hearted though very human figure, well capable of
exciting admiration, though undeserving of the deep affection
and sympathy she was able, like others of her selfwilled,
ill-fated race, to inspire. With her return to <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>
in <date value="1561">1561</date> began the personal contest between her and
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, that was only finally determined by her death
twenty-six years later.

</head>
 <p> 1. The general war was already languishing when <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> came
 to the throne, and in April <date value="1559">1559</date> peace was made
at Le Cateau Cambresis, near Cambrai, by
<note place="foot" n="1">Treaty of LeCateau Cambresis,<date value="1559">1559</date>.</note>
which <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> obtained the absolute mastery
in Italy and vouchsafed some compensation
to the beaten French by leaving Calais in their hands, so
that England had to pay the price of the Spanish victories.






<pb id="p.90" n="90"/>         <note place="foot" n="2">[<date value="1540">1540</date>-.<date value="1559">1559</date>.]</note>

 </p><p> The conclusion of the treaty of Le Cateau is one of the
great turning points in European history.  It marks the
end of the long struggle for Italy, which had begun in <date value="1494">1494</date>.
Henceforth Italy remained a submissive dependency of
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> and ceased to have a history of its own. It also ended
the long rivalry between <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>. and<placeName key="France">France</placeName> by securing
the triumph of Charles's son, without much regard for
its bearing on the European balance of power. The epochmaking
character of the period was increased by the strange
series of fatalities that beset the leading actors in the
European drama, and left their places to be filled by a
newer and younger generation. Soon after the death of
Mary of England, <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>. died in retirement in <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>.
Henry II. of<placeName key="France">France</placeName> was accidentally slain at a tournament
given to celebrate the peace, and the fiery Paul
IV. also perished before the end of the year. Philip II.,
freed from his father's control, became absolute master of
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, the Indies, the Netherlands, and Italy, while the
South German possessions of the house of Austria, along
with the newly won thrones of Hungary and Bohemia, constituted
the hereditary possessions of his uncle, who now
became the Emperor Ferdinand I. Despite the division
of Charles's inheritance into two, Philip still remained by
far the strongest monarch of Europe, and the senior and
junior branches of the Hapsburg house remained on friendly
terms, through fear of the French.<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, however, was
in a state of rapid decline. After Henry II.'s death his
three sons, Francis II. (<dateRange from="1559" to="1560">1559-1560</dateRange>),
<persName key="Charles IX">Charles IX</persName>. (<dateRange from="1560" to="1574">1560-1574</dateRange>),
and Henry III. (<dateRange from="1574" to="1589">1574-1589</dateRange>),
successively became its kings,
but they were feeble and worthless, and quite unable to
continue the strong policy of their father and grandfather,
either at home or abroad.</p><p>
  2. The Treaty of Le Cateau is even more important in
the history of religion than in the history of politics.
During the course of the war, the relations between
Lutherans and Catholics in <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName> had been settled by
the Religious Peace of <date value="1555">1555</date>, and Lutheranism had ceased
to be active. But through all these years, Protestantism,
in its Calvinistic form, had been spreading so rapidly
in Middle Europe, that the frightened Spanish and
French Courts made the necessity of the Catholic powers
<note place="foot" n="3">State of Protestantism in <date value="1559">1559</date>. </note>                             uniting to put down heresy a main motive
  for concluding peace. Philip II. was proud
of his position as the great champion of the Catholic
cause, but he saw with dismay that the Netherlands






   <pb id="p.91" n="91"/>

were honeycombed with Calvinism, and set to work
with brutal thoroughness to root out the plague. In
France, the nobles of the south, whose feudal ambitions
had been severely checked by Francis I., were now again
aiming at a revival of their disorderly freedom, and made
common cause with the Calvinists, even when they did not
become Protestants themselves.  An organised Calvinistic
party, half-religious, half-political, strove to make
itself supreme in<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, much as the Congregation and
Knox had successfully striven to break down Rome
and the Monarchy in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. It was no time for the
Catholic powers to fight out their ancient quarrels, when
the unity of their dominions, no less than the supremacy
of their faith, was threatened by determined and fanatical
rebels.</p><p>
  Side by side with the growth of Calvinism, the forces of
Catholicism revived.  The first preaching of Luther and
Zwingle had found the Catholic world corrupt,
<note place="foot" n="4">The Beginnings ofthe Counter-Reformation.</note>
lax, indifferent, and divided. A few years
later, a great religious revival broke out in
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> and Italy, which enabled the Catholics of the south
to answer the zeal of the Protestants of the north with
a zeal as great as their own. The enthusiasm for medieval
religion, that had remained a living force in <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, was
stirred up to greater heights, and spread to Italy, where
it stifled the spirit of the Renascence, already worn out
and corrupt.  Within a generation a wondrous change
came over the Papacy, and the Roman Catholic Church;
and by the time of the treaty of Le Cateau, the Counter-Reformation,
or the Catholic Reaction, was in full career.
The Papacy had reformed itself.  Instead of the political
or artistic or merely self-seeking Popes of the days of
the Renascence, the Popes of the Counter-Reformation
were as austere, as religious, and as enthusiastic as Calvin
himself. With no further chance of playing a great part
in politics, they resumed their ancient ambition of directing
the faith of the West, and strove with all their might to
win back the world from Protestantism.  New religious
orders were set up to preach Catholicism to the heathen,
the heretic or the indifferent. The most important of these
was the Order of Jcsus, established in
<date value="1540">1540</date> by Ignatius
Loyola, an enthusiastic Spanish gentleman,                       <note place="foot" n="5">Establishment ofthe Jesuits, <date value="1540">1540</date>.</note>
who, being cut off from the career of arms by
a wound that he received when fighting the French, threw
his chivalrous ardour into the service of the faith, and






<pb id="p.92" n="92"/>              <note place="foot" n="6">[<date value="1559">1559</date>--<date value="1563">1563</date>.]
</note>
founded a new type of religious order, in which the most
intense religious zeal was to be turned, by an iron system
of military discipline, to winning souls to the Church. The
Jesuits took the threefold monastic vow, along with a
special vow of obedience to the Pope. They rejected the
seclusion from the world, and the rigid routine of external
observances that had absorbed the older orders, and set
themselves to converting the world by living in it, and influencing
it as profoundly as they could. Their influence
soon spread like wildfire from their first homes in <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>
and Italy. They became the most successful of missionaries
in America, in China, and the Indies. They started
a new system of education, by which they sought to win
back the younger generation from Protestantism to the
Church. They became preachers to the people and confessors
to the kings. Wherever they went, their devotion,
their disciplined zeal, their self-sacrifice, their pliancy, and
their hard work gained them ardent followers. They were
the most effective instruments of the Counter-Reformation.
But for those whom no argument would reach, there still
<note place="foot" n="7">Revival of the Inquisition. </note>
remained the revived and reorganised Inquisition,
which sought out and tried heretics, and
delivered them over to the state to be burnt.  The worst
practical abuses of the Church were put an end to by the
<note place="foot" n="8">The Council of Trent,
<dateRange from="1545" to="1563">1545-1563</dateRange>.</note>
Council of Trent, which held its final sessions
 in <date value="1563">1563</date>; and which defined and explained
the doctrine, and improved the discipline of the Church,
while drawing a deep dividing line that separated it definitively
from all forms of Protestantism. Its work completed
the reorganisation of the Roman Church, which the preaching
of Loyola had begun. Its effect was to divide Europe
into two hostile religious camps, well prepared for combat.
When the treaty of <date value="1559">1559</date> ended political warfare, religious
warfare took its place.</p><p>
  From the treaty of Le Cateau to nearly the end of the
sixteenth century, the ancient struggles for the balance of
<note place="foot" n="9">The struggle of Jesuit and Calvinist. </note>
power seemed almost suspended in favour of
the fierce conflict of Jesuitism and Calvinism
in every country in Middle Europe. Philip
of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> was soon waging religious war against the
revolted Netherlanders: and in<placeName key="France">France</placeName> the Calvinists rose
in constant rebellion. National feeling seemed for the time
extinct, and all over Europe Catholics looked to Philip as
their natural leader in the war against heresy, and never
found his help denied. Protestants had no similar leader,






   <pb id="p.93" n="93"/>

and it was a constant source of embarrassment to <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
that they called upon her to act as their champion. So
strong was the force of circumstances, that, however
unwillingly, and however much she might protest, she
drifted into the position of the leader of European Protestantism.
But there was a still further difficulty that
beset her path. The old national animosities were too
strong to die down altogether, and, despite their desire to
make common cause against heresy, Frenchman and
Spaniard still watched each other with suspicion. This
was so far the salvation of England, that it made improbable
the combination of the Catholic powers against her,
but it necessitated a careful attention to the political as
well as to the religious balance of Europe. Before all
these embarrassments, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> found refuge in a policy
of hesitation and mediation, that was seldom heroic, and
never straightforward.  But it kept England as free as
possible from the intrigues of the Continent: it preserved
her from invasion, and, after many dangers, ended by
securing the liberty and independence of the nation.
 </p><p> 3. Despite the Treaty of Le Cateau,<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>
remained very jealous of each other. This led Philip of
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> to ignore the religious changes, and to                     <note place="foot" n="10">European Politicsafter <date value="1559">1559</date>.</note>
continue friendly with <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, and even to
offer to marry her. Though the daughter of Anne Boleyn
could not wed her sister's widower, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> was too much
afraid of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, not to wish to keep Philip on her side.
For the first ten years of her reign she was in
constant danger from<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, and the French                   <note place="foot" n="11">England's danger from<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, <dateRange from="1559" to="1569">1559-1569</dateRange></note>
queen of Scots.  On Henry II.'s death
Francis II., the husband of Mary Stewart,
became French king, and led by his wife's uncle, Francis,
Duke of Guise, was eager to combine a vigorous Catholic
policy with an attack on England.  Despite the treaty
of peace, the French queen assumed the style of Queen
of England, and strict Catholics declared that Anne
Boleyn's bastard could never be lawful queen.  But
France could do England little immediate harm, and the

The Calvinists or the Huguenots, as they were

after long hesitation, succumbed to the temptation of

longer any prospects, either of happiness or
power, in her adop'ed land, and she courageously
 went back to her mother country, to
contend almost single-handed against the Calvinistic aristocracy
and clergy. She received but a cold welcome, and
the dense fog in which she landed foreshadowed, Knox
thought, the "sorrow, dolour, darkness and impiety" that
attended the coming of a popish queen. She did all that
she could to make herself popular. She accepted the religious
revolution that had been carried out without her
consent, and only asked for liberty of worship for herself
in her palace chapel. Knox thundered against the "toleration of
idolatry" which this involved.  "One Mass," he
declared "is more fearful to me than ten thousand armed
enemies."  He denounced with equal zeal her "French
fillocks and fiddlers," and the "skipping and dancing" at
her court, "not very comely for honest women." It was in
vain that she sought to win him over by her blandishments.
He left her piesence unmoved. " If there be not
in her," he said to his friends, "a proud mind, a crafty
wit, and indurate heart against God and His Word, my
judgment faileth me." Despite this brutal attitude, Mary
held her own, and for the four years after her arrival there
was unwonted peace in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>.  Many of the nobles
were won over to her side. She left the administration in
the hands of the able and crafty Maitland of Lethington, and
of her half-brother, Lord James Stewart, whom she created
Earl of Moray, though he was an ardent Protestant.

   5. Four years of inaction taught Mary that there was
 not much to be hoped for from <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. She impatiently
 turned her eyes to the larger and more fruitful               <note place="foot" n="15">The Darnley marriage, <date value="1565">1565</date></note>.
 realm over the Border, and sought to establish
 connections with England, where the Roman Catholics, in
 obedience to orders from Rome, were withdrawing themselves
 from the parish churches, and looking with increased
 discontent on <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> and her policy. They were eager
 to win Mary to their side; and Mary, whose great ambition
 was to secure the English crown, either as <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s
 successor, or, if she could, as her supplanter, greedily
 accepted their advances.  She had been for some time
 contemplating matrimony. Rejecting <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s suggestion
 that she should wed Lord Robert Dudley, or the
 Guises' plan of matching her with some great foreign
 potentate, she resolved to marry her cousin, Henry Stewart,
Earl of Darnley, the nominee of the English Catholics.
Darnley was a tall, good-looking, worthless creature, with
neither brains nor honesty, but he was, after Mary, the
next in succession to both the Scottish and English thrones,
being the son of the Earl of Lennox, who represented a
younger branch of the house of Stewart, and of Margaret
Douglas, the daughter of Margaret Tudor, by her second
husband, the Earl of Angus. He had been brought up in
England, and, though still conforming to the English
Church, was looked upon by the English Catholics as their
natural leader. <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> was so alarmed at the marriage
that she incited the Scottish nobles, headed by Moray, to
revolt against it. In July <date value="1565">1565</date> Mary married Darnley. In
October she chased her brother over the Border.</p><p>
  6. Flushed by her double triumph, Mary prepared for
the restoration of Catholicism in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>; but she soon
found that the husband, whom she had married for
ambition, was too foolish and treacherous to be any
help to her in carrying out her plans. Accordingly she
promoted a low-born Italian, David Riccio, to be her
secretary and chief helper. Riccio had been one of the
singing men in her chapel, and his head was rather turned
by his sudden elevation. He made himself hated by his
fine clothes, his haughty bearing, and his increasing intimacy
with the queen, and excited the frenzied jealousy of
Darnley, and the sullen hatred of the grim
<note place="foot" n="16">The murderof Riccio, <date value="1566">1566</date>.</note>
nobles, whose power he had usurped. After
the wild Scottish fashion Darnley joined with his kinsfolk
and some Protestant lords in a plot to murder the favourite






<pb id="p.96" n="96"/>           <note place="foot" n="17"> [<date value="1566">1566</date>--<date value="1567">1567</date>]</note>

On 9th March <date value="1566">1566</date>, when Mary was entertaining Riccio
at supper in Holyrood, the conspirators burst into her
presence. The shrieking secretary, who clung for protection
to the skirt of her gown, was dragged into an anteroom
and brutally murdered with their daggers. Mary was
intensely indignant, but preserving her coolness with rare
courage, she cleverly won over Darnley by her blandishments,
so that the weak youth abandoned his associates as
easily as he had abandoned his wife. His defection broke
up the conspiracy, and the murderers fled, like Moray, to
England, where they were readily received by <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>.
</p><p>  7. Three months after Riccio's death, Mary gave birth to
her only child, the future James VI. of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> and <persName key="James I">James I</persName>.
<note place="foot" n="18">Mary and  Bothwell. </note>
of England. His birth greatly strengthened
her position as a claimant to the English
succession, while in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> she was already triumphant.
But in this crisis of her fortunes she sacrificed her ambitions
to her eagerness to be revenged upon her treacherous husband,
and succumbed before the malign influence
of the one man that ever strongly appealed to her passions.
Her first husband had been a sickly and degraded child;
her second was a vicious fool, who was too unstable either
to help or hinder her fortunes, but who personally excited
her strongest repugnance. James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell,
was the type of the ruffianly Border noble, fierce,
brave, reckless, unscrupulous, strong, and with unusual
intellectual force to give direction to his daring courage
and resistless energy. He soon became her chief adviser
and companion, and scandal was busy with their names.
Conscious that he possessed the queen's affection, Bothwell
set to work to clear away the obstacles to their union.
He held conference with some of the discontented nobles
at Craigmillar, where they signed a bond that Darnley
"should be put off by one way or another, and, whosoever
should take the deed in hand, they should defend it as
themselves." Bothwell himself undertook to carry out the
<note place="foot" n="19">Murder of Darnley, <date value="1567">1567</date>.</note>
deed, and his opportunity came when Darnley,
 who was recovering from a serious illness,
took up his residence at Kirk o' Field, a lonely house outside
the southern wall of Edinburgh. There, on  <date value="1567-02-09">
9th February1567</date>, he was visited by Mary and Bothwell, who left
him late in the evening. A few hours later Edinburgh
was startled by an explosion that blew the Kirk o' Field to
pieces. Darnley's dead body was found, "without a mark
or hurt on it," not far from the ruined house. On reaching






    <pb id="p.97" n="97"/>

the city Bothwell had privately returned to the Kirk o'
Field, and personally directed the murder of his rival.
How far Mary was actually guilty, the evidence is hardly
sufficient to determine. Still there is little doubt but that
she knew and welcomed the steps which Bothwell was
taking to deliver her from Darnley.
 </p><p> 8. Mary professed indignation at her husband's murder,
and offered a reward for the apprehension of the assassins;
but a placard secretly posted on the Tolbooth                    <note place="foot" n="20"> The Bothwellmarriage.</note>
door, declaring that he had been done to death
by Bothwell with her own consent, expressed the public
view of the matter.  Lennox, Darnley's father, accused
Bothwell of the murder, and a day was fixed for the trial;
but the queen took care that this should be but a sorry
farce. Lennox was afraid to appear, and no evidence was
tendered against Bothwell.  The frightened court acquitted
him, and Mary took this as an excuse for putting
herself openly on his side. Bothwell at once set about
getting a divorce from his wife, that he might be free to
wed the queen. But even the sluggish public opinion of
<placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> was deeply roused, and Mary did not dare to
marry him openly. It was accordingly arranged that he
should pretend to run off with her and force her to consent
to the union. On 24th April, as Mary was returning from
Stirling to Edinburgh, Bothwell bore down on her and
carried her off, with a show of violence, to Dunbar. In a
few days they returned to Edinburgh, Bothwell still leading
her by the bridle as a captive. He now obtained his
divorce from his wife, and a few days later was married to
Mary, after the Protestant rite.</p><p>
   9. All <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> was horrified at the union of the
 adulterous queen with her husband's murderer. The very
 nobles, who had urged Bothwell on, took advantage
 <note place="foot" n="21">     Deposition of Mary, <date value="1567">1567</date>.</note>
  of the scandal to combine against
 him and annihilate the royal power. It was to no purpose
 that Mary attended Protestant sermons and prohibited the
 celebration of Mass. Her people rose in revolt, and the
 troops that she had gathered together to defend her cause
 at Carberry Hill, outside Edinburgh, refused to strike a
 blow in her favour. Bothwell fled to Denmark, where he
 died in prison ten years later, a raving madman. Mary
 was taken prisoner, and treated with scanty courtesy. She
 was shut up in the island castle of Lochleven in Kinross,
 and forced to yield up her throne to her infant son. Moray
 acted as regent for the little James VI., and carried out







<pb id="p.98" n="98"/>          <note place="foot" n="22">  [<date value="1568">1568</date>-<date value="1569">1569</date>.] </note>

a strongly Protestant policy. But the endless factions of
the Scottish noble houses soon gave the discredited queen
<note place="foot" n="23">Lochleven and Langside, <date value="1568">1568</date> </note>
another chance of striking a blow for power.
. After eleven months of captivity, she escaped
from her island prison, whereupon the great house of
Hamilton rallied to her cause and raised all Clydesdale on
her behalf. Moray showed prompt activity in putting down
the rebellion. On 13th May <date value="1568">1568</date> he defeated his sister
and the Hamiltons at Langside not far from  Glasgow.
Mary galloped away southwards from the fatal field, and on
reaching the Solway, crossed in a fishing-boat to Workington,
hoping to find in England the protection and support
denied her in her native land.</p><p>
  10. Mary's arrival threw <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> into the greatest
embarrassment. Though she had protested against her
<note place="foot" n="24">Mary Stuart in England, <date value="1568">1568</date>. </note>
rival's deposition, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> was afraid to help
  her to win back the Scottish throne, and was
equally afraid to let her cross over to<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, lest she
should be able to renew the dying connection between
her old home and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. Yet keeping Mary under
restraint in England had dangers of its own.    The
English Catholics were getting more unruly, and the
passing of severe laws against them, and the rigid enforcement
of the Oath of Supremacy, had done little to frighten
them.   Mary's infatuation for Bothwell was now over,
and she was again the champion of Catholicism and the
claimant of the English succession. It might well be more
dangerous were she to continue to abide in England, the
focus of every Catholic conspiracy, the undoubted next
heir by blood to the childless <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> and the rightful
Queen of England in the judgment of most good Catholics.
Under these circumstances <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> found her best refuge
in her usual policy of hesitation and delay. Her strongest
card was the personal discredit into which Mary had fallen
by reason of Darnley's death and the Bothwell marriage.
She now announced that before she could take any decided
action she must investigate the grave charges brought
<note place="foot" n="25">The Conferences at, York and London. </note>
against the deposed queen, and for that purpose
appointed a body of commissioners, of
 whom the Duke of Norfolk was president,
who held conferences, first at York and afterwards at
London. Moray and other Scottish nobles laid before the
<note place="foot" n="26">The Casket Letters.  </note>          commission a series of letters and love poems,
alleged to have been exchanged between
Mary and Bothwell, and called the Casket Letters from a






    <pb id="p.99" n="99"/>

captured casket, in which it is said they had been found on
the day when Mary's cause was lost at Carberry Hill.
Mary's friends have always strenuously denied the authenticity
of these letters, pretending that they had been forged.
There is nothing in the character of the Protestant nobles
which makes this unlikely, but there is little in the letters that
Mary might not well have written.  If genuine, the correspondence
was such conclusive proof of the queen's guilt,
that Norfolk begged Moray to keep them back, and Mary's
advocates, alarmed at the probable result of a trial, protested
that, as a sovereign, she could not submit herself to
the jurisdiction of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. Mary sought a personal interview
with the English queen, who, however, declared that
she could not " without manifest blemish of her own honour
receive into her presence" a suspected murderess. Finally,
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> resolved not to allow the charges to be thoroughly
investigated, and the commission ended lamely by declaring
that nothing had been urged against Moray and his
friends "that might impair their honour or allegiance,"
and nothing had been proved against the Queen of Scots
"whereby the Queen of England should conceive any
ill opinion of her good sister."  It suited <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s
policy that Mary should remain under a cloud in England,
so that she might ultimately be used or condemned,
according to the course of circumstances, and meanwhile
her suspected character should make her a less
attractive centre for Roman Catholic intrigues.  Moray
went back to <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, secure of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s support, and
Mary remained in honourable restraint in England. For
the next eighteen years the land was beset with perpetual
plots, rebellions, and threats of invasion, all of which
had for their object the elevation of Mary into the throne
of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>.</p><p>
  11. The Revolt of the Northern Earls in <date value="1569">1569</date> was the
first fruit of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s policy with regard to the Queen of
Scots. The north of England was still as                 <note place="foot" n="27">The Revolt ofthe NorthernEarls,<date value="1569">1569</date></note>
 disaffected to the Protestant religion, and as
fully under the influence of the great families                .
as in the old days when the gentle and simple alike of <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName>
 followed the banner of the Five Wounds of Christ in
the Pilgrimage of Grace. Thomas Percy, son of the Sir
Thomas who had been beheaded for his share in the
Pilgrimage, was now Earl of Northumberland, having been
restored by Queen Mary to the title forfeited by his father's
treason. He was proud of his family influence, obstinate






<pb id="p.100" n="100"/>         <note place="foot" n="28">[<date value="1569">1569</date>--<date value="1571">1571</date>.]</note>

in his adherence to the old religion, and profoundly dissatisfied
with <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s policy. He now joined the young
Earl of Westmorland, Charles Neville, who shared his
views, in intriguing with the Spaniards in favour of Mary.
Summoned to London to account for their conduct, the
two earls refused to leave their estates, and called upon
their neighbours and tenants to join them in revolt. It
was as if the days of the Wars of the Roses had come back,
when local lords led their followers to the field against the
Crown, and threatened to break up the unity of the national
life. Northumberland joined Westmorland at Raby, whence
they marched to Durham, seized the town, and caused the
Latin Mass to be celebrated in the cathedral, before a great
gathering of northern Catholics. The Pope sent his blessing
to their enterprise.  On 22nd November the rebels,
who had marched south from Durham to Ripon, mustered
their forces on Clifford Moor, hoping to make a dash upon
Tutbury in Staffordshire, where the Queen of Scots was
imprisoned. But Northumberland and Westmorland were
dull and timid, and Thomas Radcliffe Earl of Sussex, the
President of the Council of the North, showed prudence
and policy in his preparations to resist the revolt. The
Queen of Scots was moved from Tutbury to Coventry, far
beyond the rebels' reach. The two earls retired to the
north, and wasted the time in besieging and conquering
Barnard Castle.  On Sussex's approach they dared not
risk a battle, but disbanded their troops, and on 16th
December fled over the border. Stern punishment was
meted out to their unhappy followers, and the collapse of
the rebellion made <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> stronger than ever.</p><p>
  12. Never was Protestantism more triumphant in Britain
than at the beginning of <date value="1570">1570</date>. But the enthusiasm of the
Catholics would not let the heretics remain victorious,
<note place="foot" n="29">Murder of the Regent Moray,<date value="1570">1570</date>. </note>
and new attacks followed hard on each victory.
 In January <date value="1570">1570</date> as the Regent Moray was
 riding through the narrow street of Linlithgow,
he was shot dead by Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh to gratify
a private quarrel. An attempt was made by Mary's partisans
to take advantage of his death ; and three years of
confusion and civil war ensued in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, until the strong
unscrupulous rule of James Douglas, Earl of Morton,
made regent in <date value="1573">1573</date>, again restored order and Protestant
ascendency, and Mary's cause, which had profited nothing
by the days of conflict, seemed more hopeless than ever.
Of more value to Mary than her brother's death was







    <pb id="p.101" n="101"/>

the action of Pius V, the stern Inquisitor, with whom
the austerest spirit of the Counter-Reformation attained
the papal throne.  In February <date value="1570">1570</date> Pius
<note place="foot" n="30">Pius V.'s Bull ofExcommunication, <date value="1570">1570</date>.</note>
issued a bull excommunicating <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> and
releasing her subjects from allegiance to the
heretic queen. In May the bull was published in England
by the daring of a Catholic gentleman named Felton, who
posted up a copy of it on the door of the Bishop of London's
house. Felton was discovered, tortured, and, glorying in
his act, was cruelly butchered at the place of his bold
deed. Henceforward there could be no compromise between
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> and the Roman Catholics. Pius's action had
made it very hard for any English Catholic to remain at
once obedient to the Pope and loyal to the queen. A very
few might maintain that the Pope was going beyond his
powers in interfering with the civil government of England,
but in an age of the fiercest religious passions such a view
seemed treason against the head of the Church. Henceforth
the Romanist was almost bound to be a traitor to
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. A bitter struggle ensued, and a long series of
Catholic plots showed how earnestly the active Romanists
strove to carry out the Pope's wishes.  But it was a
measure of doubtful wisdom for Pius thus to emphasise
the incompatibility of the position of a good Catholic and
a good Englishman. English national feeling was indignant
at the presumption of the foreign potentate, who
aspired to usurp the functions of the English Parliament.
Pius's action united all shades of English Protestantism in
enthusiastically upholding the queen as the champion,
not only of the Protestant religion, but also of the independence
of the English people. The very Puritans that
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> was persecuting heartily supported her in her
struggle against Rome, recognising that her life alone stood
in the way of a reaction more complete than that which
had marked the reign of her sister.</p><p>
  13. The Parliament of <date value="1571">1571</date> answered Pius's sentence by
passing acts that made it treason to introduce papal bulls
into the country, to be reconciled with the
<note place="foot" n="31">Anti-Romanlegislation, <date value="1571">1571</date>.</note>
Roman See, or to be the cause of the conversion
of others to the Roman faith. Luckily for <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
there was no immediate need to use these stern weapons
against the Pope. England kept true to the queen, and the
continued jealousy of<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> made it impossible
for the two foremost Catholic powers to unite to execute the
bull of deposition.<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, hitherto <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s chief enemy,

was distracted by war and faction, and even Mary Stewart
ceased to expect effective help from the weak government of
<note place="foot" n="33">Foreign Relations of England.</note>
her wretched brothers-in-law. Philip of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>
 had become the undoubted leader of European
Catholicism, and henceforth the discontented Romanists
of England and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> sought help from him, rather than
from<placeName key="France">France</placeName>.  The result was a gradual change in the
relations between <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> and Philip.  The Spanish king,
hitherto ever anxious to uphold <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> despite her
<note place="foot" n="34">The danger from <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>.</note>
heresy, was henceforth the centre of every
attempt to dethrone her and put the half-French
Mary Stewart in her place. But Philip was as slow
and cautious as <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, and even his religious zeal did
not suffer him to pursue this policy with his whole heart.
He was still afraid of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> joining the French against
him, and rekindling an European war.  <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> was
equally afraid of the union of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> and<placeName key="France">France</placeName>.  The
result was that though England and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> gradually drifted
into deadly hostility to each other, both <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> and
Philip feared to declare open war. This underhand hostility,
this deadly hatred, cloaked under pacific forms, produced
a state far worse than war.  But for more than
fifteen years longer England and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> were still nominally
at peace.</p><p>
14. The failure of the rebellion of <date value="1569">1569</date> did
not discourage the foes of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. A Florentine banker named
Ridolfi, who had long resided in England, now strove to unite
<note place="foot" n="35">The Ridolfi Plot,and the execution of Norfolk <dateRange from="1571" to="1572">1571-1572</dateRange>.</note>
all who wished for the release of Mary and
 the restoration of Catholicism, and persuaded
 the Duke of Norfolk to put himself at the
 head of the movement.  Thomas Howard,
Duke of Norfolk, was the son of the poet Earl of Surrey,
and early in Mary's reign had succeeded his grandfather,
<persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s threatened victim, to the only duchy that
still was left in England. He was popular, well-meaning,
manly in bearing, and the richest nobleman of his time.
He had conformed to <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s religion and had been
trusted by her with some high appointments, but he was
only a lukewarm friend of the reforming cause. He was
indignant that his wealth, blood, and ability should be so
little esteemed at court, and that his power remained but
insignificant in comparison with that of low-born men, like
Cecil and Walsingham.  He was now a widower, and in
the days of the Conference of York, Maitland of Lethington
had craftily suggested to him that the best way to end



    <pb id="p.103" n="103"/>
all troubles would be that he should marry Mary, who
might then be restored and recognised as <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s
successor. To clear his way, Mary's marriage with Bothwell
was pronounced invalid.  The dazzling prospect thus
opened out turned Norfolk's confused brain, and made
him henceforth the puppet of every conspiracy. In <date value="1569">1569</date>,
the Northern Earls had advocated his marriage with Mary,
and his relations with the rebels had been so suspicious,
that he was for a time imprisoned. However he protested
that he desired to wed the Queen of Scots with <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s
good will, and as her true subject, and before long, on
renouncing his marriage purpose, he was released. Ridolfi
now plied him with specious arguments, and persuaded him
to embark in open treason.  Norfolk signed a declaration
that he was a Catholic, and ready to lead an armed
rebellion, if assured of the support of the King of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>.
Ridolfi was a sorry plotter, and before any overt action
had been taken, the threads of the conspiracy had been
unravelled by Cecil, In January <date value="1572">1572</date>, Norfolk was tried
and convicted of treason.  A violently Protestant Parliament
urged <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> to carry out the sentence, and mete
out a similar doom to the Queen of Scots. The queen
compromised matters by ordering Norfolk's execution,
five months after his sentence. He died proclaiming his
innocence, and declaring that he "never was a Papist since
he knew what religion meant."   In her anger against
Philip of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> sent the Spanish ambassador
out of the country, and at Cecil's instance entered upon
protracted but insincere negotiations for checkmating
Spanish hostility, by marrying herself to the brother of the
French king.</p><p>
15. With the failure of the Ridolfi conspiracy, the extreme
tension which had begun with Mary Stewart's arrival
in England   ceased.  For the next five
<note place="foot" n="36">Peaceful times in England,<dateRange from="1572" to="1577">1572-1577</dateRange>.</note>
years, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> was undisturbed by conspiracies
 and rebellions, and was able to wage
war against the Puritans, and strengthen her authority at
home, undisturbed by any fear of foreign interference.
Mary remained quietly in her English prison, and the
regents of her little son bore undisturbed sway in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>.
Despite the papal excommunication, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> was
stronger than ever.<placeName key="France">France</placeName> sank into worse and worse disorder,
and the attention of Philip was fully absorbed by
the outbreak of the Revolt of the Netherlands.

</p><p>16. Each of the seventeen provinces of the Netherlands, which
were now ruled by the King of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, had its separate institutions,
and was proud of its local liberties. Ever since the Burgundian inheritance
<note place="foot" n="38">The Revolt of the Netherlands </note>

had been made to weld the seventeen provinces together, into one centralised despotic state. <persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>.
had sought to combine this policy with the extirpation of heresy, and
after the treaty of Le Cateau, Philip set to work systematically to root
out heresy, and set up his own absolute authority. The great nobles,
though mostly Catholics, strenuously resisted him, and Philip sent the
<note place="foot" n="39">The rule of Alva <dateRange from="1567" to="1573">1567-1573</dateRange>. </note>
Duke of Alva, his best Spanish general, to overawe
 them. From   <dateRange from="1567" to="1572">1567 to 1572</dateRange>, Alva ruled the hapless
Netherlands with an iron hand, strove to stamp out
Protestantism by wholesale executions, and with the help of a large
Spanish army effectively crushed the political opposition. But in the
north, and especially in the wealthy seafaring provinces of Holland
<note place="foot" n="40">Revolt of Holland and Zealand <date value="1572">1572</date>.</note>
and Zealand, nearly the whole population was fiercely
 Protestant, and even Alva found persecution of little
avail to change the faith of a whole nation.  The
hardiest of the Hollanders fled to their ships, and soon
found that the rich and defenceless merchantmen of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> became
their easy prey. Encouraged by their success, the whole of the
provinces of Holland and Zealand rose in a desperate revolt in <date value="1572">1572</date>,
and chose as their leader William, Prince of Orange, called the Silent,
a man of strong character and moderate Protestant views, and possessed
of vast estates at Nassau on the Middle Rhine, and in the
Netherlands, as well as of the Principality of Orange on the Lower
Rhone. Alva did his best to put down the revolt, but the rebels cut
the dykes, and flooded the low-lying country, so that his progress
was exceedingly slow. Conscious of his failure, Alva obtained, in <date value="1573">1573</date>,
permission to return to <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. His successor, Requesens, continued the
severe struggle, but neither the military resources of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, nor the
wealth of the Indies, availed to stamp out the rebellion.
<note place="foot" n="41">Government ofRequesens,<dateRange from="1573" to="1576">1573-1576</dateRange>.</note>
In <date value="1576">1576</date>, Requesens died suddenly, whereupon the
 Spanish army, angry at not getting its pay, burst into
mutiny, and plundered Antwerp with such fiendish
cruelty, that resentment of this Spanish Fury, as it was called, spread
the revolt all over the Netherlands. In <date value="1576">1576</date>, the Seventeen Provinces all
united in the Pacifcation of Ghent, by which Protestants and Catholics
<note place="foot" n="42">Pacifcation of Ghent <date value="1576">1576</date>.</note>
alike pledged themselves to uphold their traditional
liberties, and procure the expulsion of the Spanish
troops. Before long, however, national and religious diferences
split up the confederacy. The Catholic provinces of the south
were induced by the new governor, Philip's gallant bastard brother, Don
John of Austria, to return to the obedience of Philip, on his promising
not to garrison the land with Spanish troops, and to abandon his
<note place="foot" n="43">Union of Utrecht <date value="1579">1579</date>.</note>                                 attack on their franchises. In <date value="1579">1579</date>, the seven northern
 provinces, which were mainly Protestant, including
Holland, Zealand, Utrecht, Gelderland, Groningen,
Friesland, and Overyssel, concluded the Union of Utrecht, which flatly
renounced all obedience to <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, and became a federal republic under
the hereditary stadtholdership, or lieutenancy, of the Prince of Orange.
This was the beginning of the Dutch Republic, or the Commonwealth
of the Seven United Provinces.  After Don John's death, Philip's



             <pb id="p.105" n="105"/>
governor was Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, who continued in
office from <date value="1578">1578</date> to his death in
<date value="1592">1592</date>. Parma was an excellent general,
and a shrewd statesman, whose diplomacy won over the southern
provinces, while his arms won notable triumphs over the rebellious
north. Philip aided him with all his resources, knowing that, if the
heretical Netherlanders succeeded in maintaining their liberty, a deadly
blow had been dealt to the supremacy of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, and to the integrity of
his dominions as well as to the progress of the Counter-Reformation,
that was still in its full career of success.</p><p>
17. In the same year as the revolt of Holland, came a fresh crisis
in the history of French Protestantism.  Under <persName key="Charles IX">Charles IX</persName>., the
queen mother, Catharine de' Medici, had aspired to
<note place="foot" n="44"> The Massacre of St. Bartholomew<date value="1572">1572</date>.</note>
hold the balance between Protestants and Catholics,                                     ,
but in <date value="1572">1572</date>, fearing that the Huguenots were becoming
too powerful, she turned her son against them.
The result was the fearful Massacre of St. Bartholomew, which took
place on St. Bartholomew's Day, 24th August. The Huguenots lost
many of their leaders, though like their Dutch brethren, they were not
cowed by brutality, but took to arms with the courage of despair. In
<date value="1574">1574</date>, Henry III. succeeded <persName key="Charles IX">Charles IX</persName>., and went back to the old
policy of his mother of balancing between the two confessions. As
the Catholics were the stronger, the king, though a
Catholic, took care to prevent the Huguenots being
<note place="foot" n="45"> The three Henry's and rise of the Catholic League.</note>
too badly beaten. The Protestants were now headed
by Henry, Duke of Bourbon and King of Navarre,
who was the next heir to the throne, while the
Catholic leader was now Henry, Duke of Guise, the son of Duke
Francis, the conqueror of Calais. Disgusted that the Catholics were
prevented by the king from reaping the fruits of victory, Henry of
Guise formed the Catholic League, which strove to uphold the interests
of religion without regard to the interests of the crown. The
result was a perpetual struggle, and the weak king, unable to carry
out effectively the part of a mediator, rapidly lost influence.
</p><p>18. The religious contest in the Netherlands and<placeName key="France">France</placeName>
soon gave <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> ample opportunities for revenging
herself on the Spanish and French Courts,
<note place="foot" n="46">Effects of the Counter-Reformatinon</note>
which had in her days of adversity intrigued
with her domestic enemies and threatened
invasion on behalf of Mary Stewart. Religious politics.
passions were so excited that national feeling had become
much weaker, and it seemed in every country the most
natural thing in the world for men to call in foreigners of
their own religious belief, to put down fellow countrymen of
the opposite way of thinking. The revolted Netherlanders
and the sorely pressed Huguenots both turned for help to
Protestant England, just as the English Catholics and the
Catholic League in<placeName key="France">France</placeName> looked up to Philip of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> for
support.   England was extremely sympathetic with the
struggling Calvinists in the Netherlands and<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, and



<pb id="p.106" n="106"/>         <note place="foot" n="47"> [<date value="1572">1572</date>--<date value="1577">1577</date>.]</note>
from the beginning of the religious wars English volunteers
had gladly fought on their behalf, and English money had
flowed freely to their assistance. But the earnest Protestan ts
hoped that the queen would openly interfere, and uphold
with all her resources their persecuted brethren on the continent.
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> took a very different view of the matter,
having no sympathy with the Dutch or Huguenots, and
fearing lest Philip should retaliate by intrigues with the
English Catholics.  Circumstances, however, were too
strong for her.  Her best statesmen, like Cecil and
Walsingham, thought that <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> ought to frankly take
up the position of leader of Protestantism all over Western
Europe.  In some measure her ministers forced <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s
hand, but her hand was still more forced by the
action of her ardent Protestant subjects. Besides giving
help in men and money to the revolted Protestants, the
more adventurous English lost no opportunity of insulting
or robbing a Popish prince.  They joined with the
Dutch in plundering Spanish merchant ships
<note place="foot" n="48">The growing antagonism between England and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>.</note>
and Spanish colonies. We shall see in the
next chapter the rise of English naval power
and the action of the bold adventurers, who
waged open war against <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> beyond the ocean, when
the two countries remained nominally at peace. The
result was that to the intense religious hostility of
England and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> was now added an equally sharp
commercial antagonism. It required all the coolness and
policy of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> and Philip to avoid open war, and
though shrinking from this, both sovereigns sought to retaliate
by all means in their power. Though <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
continued to protest that she would have no dealings with
rebels, yet she was gradually induced to give material
though grudging support to the revolted Netherlanders.
She characteristically cloaked her change of front with
lying protestations that deceived no one. About <date value="1577">1577</date>
troubled times again began. Don John of Austria, now
governor of the Netherlands, proposed to invade England,
restore Catholicism, and marry Mary Stewart. In the
same year Francis Drake started on his famous voyage
round the world, during which he played such havoc with
Spanish colonies and trade. Philip retaliated by inciting a
Catholic reaction in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, and by sending troops to
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, which was at the moment in revolt against <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
[see chap. viii.]. In the Netherlands the successes of the
Duke of Parma, Don John's successor, excited <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s



  <pb id="p.107" n="107"/>
fears, especially as the Protestants were slowly but surely
losing ground in<placeName key="France">France</placeName>. But of all the causes of alarm,
none were so formidable as the systematic efforts which
were now being made by the Roman Catholics to win over
England.</p><p>
19. Despite all the efforts of Rome, England seemed to
be becoming more and more Protestant. There was
a thin but continued stream of exiles who
<note place="foot" n="49">The college at Douai and Reims.</note>
fled to the continent for conscience' sake ; but
in England Mass was rarely said, the Roman
clergy were few, scattered, and wanting in energy, and as
time went on, the great body of Englishmen was slowly
becoming reconciled to the Via Media of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. A
determined effort was now made to re-kindle the zeal of
the English Romanists, and win back those lovers of
ancient ways who were slowly drifting into the open fold
of the English Church.  In <date value="1568">1568</date>, a man of energy and
ability, William  Allen, a Lancashire gentleman's son,
who had abandoned England rather than take the Oath
of Supremacy, set up at Douai in <placeName key="Flanders">Flanders</placeName> a college
for English Catholics, which before long became specially
devoted to training up young Englishmen for the Roman
priesthood, that they might return to their native country
as missionaries of the faith.  The disturbances that
followed on the Pacification of Ghent made Douai an
unsafe place for Allen's college, and in <date value="1578">1578</date>, it was transferred
to French territory at Reims, where it flourished
under the protection of the Duke of Guise.
<note place="foot" n="50">The Seminary   Priests.</note>
Before long the pupils of Douai and Reims
came over to England as apostles of the Counter-Reformation.
Great results followed the work of these seminary
priests. The Catholics ceased to attend their parish
churches, and met together to hear Mass, said secretly
by one of the wandering    missionaries.  They sent
their children abroad to school and strove in every way
to keep aloof from  the Protestants.  The success of
the seminarists soon began to excite the alarm of the
government, especially as these priests, bound by the
bull of Pope Pius, taught that <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> had no right
to the throne, and that good Catholics ought not to
obey her. The severe penal laws passed in <date value="1571">1571</date>, when
the fear of the Bull of Excommunication was
<note place="foot" n="51"> Execution of Cuthbert Mayne,<date value="1577">1577</date>.</note>
new, had hitherto slumbered unused, but in
<date value="1577">1577</date> Cuthbert Mayne, a pupil of the college
at Douai, was arrested in a Cornish house and executed



<pb id="p.108" n="108"/>        <note place="foot" n="52"> [<date value="1580">1580</date>-<date value="1581">1581</date></note>
at Launceston as a traitor for denying the queen's supremacy,
and having in his possession the printed copy of
an insignificant papal bull, which brought him under the
law.</p><p>
20. Three years later a new and more formidable type
of missionary appeared than the "secular" seminary priests.
<note place="foot" n="53">The Jesuit Invasion, <date value="1580">1580</date>.</note>
In June <date value="1580">1580</date>, Robert Parsons, the first Jesuit
 who came to England, landed at Dover, disguised
 as a soldier, with a "buff suit, laid with gold lace,
and hat and feathers suited to the same." He was a
dexterous political intriguer, who at once made his presence
felt. He was soon joined by the high-souled, sweet-tempered
enthusiast, Edmund Camipion, another Jesuit priest.
Henceforwards the Jesuits, though always few in numbers,
exercised enormous influence on the course of the Roman
mission, animating the secular priests with something of
their spirit, though incurring before long their bitter
hostility.</p><p>
Parsons and Campion at once set actively to work,
travelling all over the country at great risk, saying Mass,
hearing confessions, strengthening the zeal of the active
and winning over the lax or indifferent to the faith. The
<note place="foot" n="54">The Recusancy Laws, <date value="1581">1581</date>.</note>                           extent of their success was magnified by
  the terror which the name of Jesuit inspired,
and Parliament, when it met in <date value="1581">1581</date>, passed a new
series of rigid laws against the Romanists. It was made
an offence, punishable by a fine of &#x00A3;20 a month, not to
go regularly to church, and the Pofpish Recusants, who persisted
in staying away, had to be men of good substance
if they were not to be ruined by their refusal. A keen
Martyrdom of  search was made for the Jesuits, and, though
Edmund Cam-  Parsons escaped to the Continent, Campion
pion, <date value="1581">1581</date>.  was betrayed  and apprehended.  Amidst
the execrations of the mob, he was taken to the Tower
in July I58, closely pinioned, with a paper stuck in
his hat, bearing the inscription, "Campion the seditious
Jesuit." It was found very hard to bring him under the
law of treason, for he was a religious enthusiast, who cared
little for politics, and, far from teaching sedition, he had
explained away the bull of excommunication and could not
be convicted of disloyalty to the queen. He was cruelly
tortured, and when "worn with the rack, his memory
destroyed, and his force of mind almost exhausted," he
was compelled to hold a public disputation against well-prepared
Protestant divines, wherein he showed such patience,



  <pb id="p.109" n="109"/>
readiness, and simplicity that he extorted the admiration
even of his persecutors. When his trial came, he was not
so much as able to hold up his hand to plead without
assistance.  He was convicted, on the scanty evidence
that satisfied the judges in the treason trials of the time.
"If our religion do make us traitors," he declared, "then
are we worthy to be condemned, but otherwise we are as
true subjects as ever the queen had. In condemning us
you condemn all your own ancestors, for what have we
taught that they did not uniformly teach?"   On ist
December <date value="1581">1581</date> the high-souled Jesuit suffered the last
penalty of the law at Tyburn. From his safe refuge on
the Continent, his associate Parsons devised new plots
against the queen.</p><p>
21. Thoroughly frightened by the Jesuit invasion, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
fell back on the ancient scheme of a French marriage,
hoping that if the representatives of moderate
<note place="foot" n="55"> The Anjou marriage scheme and <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s active intervention in the Netherlands,<date value="1581">1581</date>.</note>
Protestantism  and  moderate  Catholicism
were thus united, the extreme tension of religious
excitement might be relaxed, and a general
political opposition to <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> might be organised.
A treaty of alliance was signed in <date value="1581">1581</date>
between England and<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, and in the same year,
Francis, Duzke of Anjou [before <date value="1576">1576</date>, Duke of Alenton,]
younger brother of Henry III., and the only other surviving
son of Henry II., appeared in England, to woo the
queen in person. It was a strange courtship, and yet it
was the most serious of all the many marriage projects
in which <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> had ever engaged. The queen was
now forty-eight years old, and Anjou was only twenty-seven,
contemptible in intellect and character, and so
repulsive in appearance, with his ugly pock-marked face,
great head, and harsh croaking voice, that <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> jestingly
called him "her frog." He now manifested a fantastic
devotion to <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, and one day in the great
gallery of the palace at Greenwich, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> gave him a
kiss, put a ring upon his finger, and presented him to her
household as her future husband. Anjou was despatched
to the Netherlands, where it was hoped that a Catholic
prince might revive the Pacification of Ghent, by binding
together Protestants and Catholics alike against Philip of
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. With unwonted generosity, the queen lavished vast
sums to support his enterprise. It was the first time that
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> had actively interfered on behalf of the revolted
Netherlanders. But Anjou's incompetence soon spoilt all



<pb id="p.110" n="110"/>   <note place="foot" n="56"> [<date value="1583">1583</date>--<date value="1585">1585</date>.]</note>
his fair prospects. In <date value="1583">1583</date>, his disorderly soldiers wreaked
a French fu/:y at Antwerp, which equalled in hideousness
the Spanish fury that had followed Requesens' death.
Thereupon the Flemish towns, disgusted at his folly and
treachery, drove Anjou from the country, and he went back
to<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, where he soon died.  Despite the Greenwich
kiss, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> soon repented of her foolish promise, though
she supported him to the end in his scheme of establishing
himself in the Netherlands.</p><p>
22. The French alliance did little to save <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
from <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> and the Jesuits.  Protestant ascendency was
threatened in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> (see chap. viii.) and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> as
well as in England. Since <date value="1573">1573</date>, the Earl of Morton had
<note place="foot" n="57">Emme Stewart attempts a Catholic reaction <dateRange from="1579" to="1582">1579-1582.</dateRange></note>
acted as recent in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. He was a fierce,
 rough, vicious man, "ower mickle given to
 the world," but he kept sound order, and
 maintained the English alliance, seeking,
in his dislike of the Presbyterian clergy,
to make the constitution of the Church more nearly correspond
with the English fashion. In <date value="1579">1579</date>, EslW Sezrarl,
Cozi of of Al/itbi,, the nephew of the late Earl of Lennox,
went over from<placeName key="France">France</placeName> to <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, on the pretext of
claiming his uncle's inheritance. He was a secret agent of
the Pope and the Duke of Guise, and his real object was
to bring about a Catholic reaction in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. He dexterously
wormed his way into the favour of James VI., who
was now a precocious, suspicious, over-educated boy of
thirteen.  James made him  Duke of Lennox, and he
soon became so strong, that he accused Morton of the
murder of Darnley, and in I58 procured his conviction
and execution. Lennox now hoped to bring the young
king over to Catholicism, but he still had to contend
against the fierce opposition of the Presbyterian clergy,
who were not won to him, either by his attack on their
enemy Morton, or even by his profession of Protestantism.
<note place="foot" n="58">The Raid of Ruthven, <date value="1582">1582</date>.</note>
In <dateRange from="1582" to="1582">1582,</dateRange> the Raid of Rlcthven was carried out
  by the Earl of Cowrie, in the interests of the
nobles and clergy. James was practically taken prisoner,
and forced to dissociate himself from Lennox, whereupon
the baffled intriguer returned to<placeName key="France">France</placeName>. James, as he
grew up to manhood, cleverly endeavoured to shake himself
free from the fetters into which the clergy and nobles
had cast him.   So far as he could, he now continued
Morton's policy, both as regards the Church and England.
The Jesuit attack on <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> had utterly failed, and the



     <pb id="p.111" n="111"/>
young king remained more firmly attached than ever to
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>.</p><p>
23. The danger in England was not so easily surmounted,
Priest after priest underwent the hideous
penalties of treason, but other enthusiasts
<note place="foot" n="59">The Throgmortonconspiracyy,
<date value="1583">1583</date>,and the Bond of<dateRange from="1584" to="1585">1584-85</dateRange></note>
readily came to supply their place. As the
conflict thickened, both sides threw scruples
to the winds. In <date value="1582">1582</date>, Parsons and Allen Association,
arranged in conjunction with Philip II. and 14.
Guise a great plot for the murder of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, Guise
promising to send an army to make his cousin Mary queen
and to restore Catholicism, as soon as the assassination
had been effected.  In <date value="1583">1583</date>, Francis Throgmorton, a
subordinate agent of the conspiracy, was arrested, and
forced by torture to disclose the whole story. The queen
ran a very real risk, for the religious zealots of the age
used assassination as one of their favourite weapons.
Twenty years before, Guise's father, Duke Francis, had
been murdered by a Calvinist enthusiast. The founder of
the 1) utch Republic, William of Orange, after escaping from
several previous attempts, was pistolled, Ioth July <date value="1584">1584</date>, by
a Catholic fanatic named Balthazar Gerard.</p><p>
It was the crisis of the long struggle. Early in <date value="1584">1584</date>,
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> finally expelled the Spanish ambassador.  The
murder of Orange renewed the fears for the queen's safety,
and the loyalty of her subjects now expressed itself in a
novel form. In November <date value="1584">1584</date>, on the proposal of the
Council, a Bond of Association was drawn up by Burghley
and Walsingham, which all classes of Englishmen eagerly
entered into.  The Association pledged its members to
defend the queen, and in the event of her murder, bound
them to put to death any person on whose behalf th6
deed was committed, so as to prevent the assassins from
reaping the fruit of their crime. This was a clear intimation
that the murder of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> would be followed by
the death of the Queen of Scots. In <date value="1585">1585</date>, Parliament met
and confirmed the Association. It also passed an Act
banishing all Jesuits and seminary priests, and inflicting

Parma captured Antwerp, and the Netherlanders in their

<note place="foot" n="61">Leicester in the Netherlands,<dateRange from="1585" to="1586">1585-6</dateRange>.</note>
The queen was too prudent to accept this
offer, but she sent an army to help them,
under the command of her dearest friend
Leicester, whose pride and quarrelsomeness made him unfit
for so delicate a task, and who was now in broken health,
and as unable as Anjou himself to make headway against
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. Among the gallant youths who followed Leicester
to the Low Countries, eager to fight the Spaniards, was his
accomplished nephew, Sir Philip Sidney, poet, romance-writer,
and soldier, who got his death wound in an heroic
charge near Zut/ticn.  In <date value="1586">1586</date>, Leicester disobeyed the
queen's instructions, by accepting from the States-General
the absolute government of the Seven Provinces. He then
quarrelled with the Dutch, calling them  "churls and
tinkers," and rightly complained that <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> refused to
send him supplies. In September <date value="1586">1586</date>, he went home in
disgust, leaving the Dutch to secure their liberty for themselves.
</p><p>25. Despite the Bond of Association, a new plot was
formed in <date value="1586">1586</date> for murdering <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, and simultaneously
releasing the Queen of Scots. The instigator
<note place="foot" n="62">The BabingtonConspiracy, <date value="1586">1586</date>.</note>
of this was the seminary priest John Ballard,
and his instruments were Anthony Babington, and other
well-born Catholic youths.  The plot was hatched in
London, where Babington and his friends talked over the
details at supper-parties in taverns, and sought divine
assistance by hearing Mass regularly. Babington was a
vain fool, who, anxious above all things to acquaint Mary
with his design, rashly wrote her long letters describing
every detail of the plot. These Mary answered, giving her
approval to the murder of her rival. Walsingham's spies
soon got wind of the conspiracy, and obtained possession
of some of the correspondence between Mary and Babington.
In September <date value="1586">1586</date>, Babington, Ballard, and five of
their associates were executed. Babington boasted on the
scaffold that he had engaged in a deed lawful and
meritorious. He was taken down from the gallows before
he was dead, and the last grim operations of the law were
performed on his still living body.
</p><p>26. The Babington Conspiracy settled the doom  of
Mary Stewart. For many years she had been the focus of
every plot, but remained unharmed in her prison, though
stern Protestants had long clamoured for her death. The



  <pb id="p.113" n="113"/>
unscrupulous dexterity of Walsingham had now procured
evidence against her of direct complicity in the design to
murder the queen. In September <date value="1586">1586</date>, she
<note place="foot" n="63">Trial and execution of Mary,Queen of Scots.
<dateRange from="1586" to="1587">1586-87</dateRange>.</note>
was takle  under close custody to Fotheringay
Castle, near l'eterborough, where, in October,
she was tried on this charge, and condemned,
though she vainly protested that <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
could exercise no jurisdiction over a crowned queen.
This conviction cut her off from the succession, under the
Act of Association, but Parliament, which met in the end
of October, urged( the immediate execution of her death
sentence. '"We have seen," said the Lords and Commons,
"by how manifold, most dangerous and execiable practices
Mary, commonly called the Queen of Scots, hath compassed
the destruction of your Majesty's sacred person,
bringing us and this noble crown back again into the
thraldom of the Romish tyranny, and utterly ruinating and
overthrowing the happy state and commonwealth of this
realm.  W ,e therefore humbly beseech your Highness to
take speedy order to execute the sentence, because we
cannot find any means to provide for your safety, but by
the speedy execution of the said queen."  Even these
strong words could not induce the queen to order Mary's
execution. After long and pitiable hesitation, she signed
the death-warrant, but soon after she was cowardly enough
to urge Sir Amyas Paulet, the gaoler of the Queen of Scots,
to murder her privately, so that the odium of a public
execution might be avoided. Paulet refused to do this,
and the Council, losing patience, directed Davison, the
Secretary of State, to despatch the warrant to Fotheringay.
</p><p>On February 7th, <date value="1587">1587</date>, Mary was ordered to prepare herself
for execution on the following day. She made ready
to meet her fate with that admirable courage which had
not been impaired, even by the weary years of imprisonment
that had aged her before her time. Next morning she was
taken to the great hall of the castle, where the scaffold had
been erected. She played her part with consummate power,
and turned a deaf ear to the clumsy exhortations of the
Dean of Peterborough. " I die," she said, "a true woman
to my religion, to <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, and to<placeName key="France">France</placeName>. I have always
wished the union of England and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. Tell my son I
have done nothing prejudicial to the dignity of his crown."
Her remains were buried at leterborough, hard by the tomb
of Catharine of Aragon. There they rested until her son,
after his accession to the English throne, transferred them

to a nobler tomb at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> loudly protested
that the execution was carried out despite her

by the deed. There was no longer any object in forming
plots to murder <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, when the next successor to the
throne was the Protestant King of Scots. The worst
dangers to <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> and Protestantism passed away with
the tragedy at Fotheringay.</p>

The Elizabethan Seamen and the Triumph of
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. <dateRange from="1587" to="1603">1587-1603</dateRange>.</head>
<p>1. Up to the middle of the sixteenth century, England was
distinguished neither for its trade nor its seamanship.
Englishmen seemed to foreigners to be an unadventurous.
<note place="foot" n="1">Trade and adventure in Medieval England</note>
easy-going, moody, and contemplative people,
 careless of progress and neglectful of commerce,
 but loving good living, hard knocks,
booty won in war, and, in the intervals of
fighting, living lazy and inactive lives on their fields at
home. Until the fifteenth century the foreign trade of
England had been largely in the hands of foreigners, such as
the Venetians and the Germans from the Hanse towns, these
latter having a factory in London called the Steelyard. It
was a step in advance when Englishmen began to open up
foreign markets for themselves, and when the restlessness
of the early sixteenth century broke down the traditional
system of farming, and left many either to shift
for themselves or to starve. Yet few saw any remedy for
the woes of England except in bringing back the good old
times, and fewer still looked to any new occupations to take
away the hands that were no longer wanted on the land.
There was a slight development of manufacturing industry
when the persecution of Alva drove many of the weavers
of <placeName key="Flanders">Flanders</placeName> and Brabant to take refuge in England and
teach their new countrymen a little of their own rare skill.
But the first beginnings of the new impulse are to be seen
in adventure rather than in trade, and, even when successful
adventure opened out new avenues of commerce, in
trade rather than in manufactures.



              <pb id="p.115" n="115"/>
</p><p>2. The revelation of a new world by Columbus and
Vasco da Gama had hardly affected England at all, though
conspicuous among those who followed on
<note place="foot" n="2"> <persName key="Henry VII">Henry VII</persName>. and the Cabots,<dateRange from="1496" to="1498">1496-1498</dateRange>.</note>
the track of Columbus was John Cabot, a
Venetian settled in Bristol, who had been
sent on two voyages of discovery by the foresight of Henry
VII. (<dateRange from="1496" to="1498">1496-1498</dateRange>)
Cabot discovered the coasts of Labrador and
Nova Scotia, but nothing practical came of his
enterprise, and his son, Sebastian, finding
<note place="foot" n="3">The dawn of activity.</note>
little encouragement, save fair words and
promises from  <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. and Wolsey, quitted the
country of his birth, and took service with the Emperol
<persName key="Charles V">Charles V</persName>. With little help from the state, the undaunted
Bristol merchants sent out under <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. various
expeditions of discovery, that first gave England a share,
however small, in the Newfoundland fisheries and the trade
with West Africa. The stirrings of the new impulse became
stronger under <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>., soon after whose accession,
Sebastian Cabot was tempted back to England.    The
London merchants were suffering from severe depression
of trade and the competition of the foreign merchants of
the Steelyard. Cabot remedied some of the grievances of
the English merchants against the Steelyard, and was
made governor of the Company of Merchant Adventurers,
the chief English society of traders. In
<date value="1553">1553</date>, at Cabot's
suggestion, an expedition was sent out with
<note place="foot" n="4">Expedition of Willoughby and Chancellor, <date value="1553">1553</date></note>
SirHugh Willoughby as admiral and Richard
Chancellor as pilot, with the object of opening                       .
up trade with the strange countries of the north and east,
and, if possible, of discovering a North-East passage to
China through the Arctic seas. The little squadron was
assailed by a great tempest off the Norwegian coast, in
which Willoughby, with two of the ships, was separated
fiom the rest of his company.  The admiral sought to
winter in the north of Russia, but, after a long series of
misfortunes, the whole of both crews were starved or frozen
to death. Chancellor had better luck with the remaining
ships, successfully reaching the White Sea, and establishing
friendly relations with Russia. Chancellor visited Ivan the
Terrible at his capital in Moscow, and opened out a trading
connection with Russia, so successfully that a Muscovy or
Russia Compfany was started, and in <date value="1556">1556</date> he set forth on
a second voyage, during which he perished in shipwreck
off the coast of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. The Russian trade at once became
important. and the friendship of the Czar was highly prized



<pb id="p.116" n="116"/>     <note place="foot" n="5"> [<date value="1556">1556</date>--<date value="1572">1572</date>.]</note>
by <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. But Chancellor's greatest fame was that he
was the first Englishman who made a name as a discoverer,
and the true precursor of the Elizabethan mariners.
</p><p>3. The impulse to seamanship and navigation was the
direct result of the great stirring of men's minds that
<note place="foot" n="6">TheReformation and seafaring adventure.</note>
followed the Reformation. The restless
 adventurers who took to the sea were of a class
which was specially open to the new doctrines,
and, though careless of theology and reckless in their lives,
they were sound Protestants and great haters of the Pope.
Greed of gain was even more powerful with them than religious
enthusiasm, and in those days when even the narrow
seas of Europe were swarming with robber craft, the line
between the peaceful trader and pirate was by no means a
hard and fast one. Already in Mary's reign some of the
fiercer Protestant refugees took to the sea, and, working
from the French coasts, despoiled the ships of Philip and
Mary with special zest. Before long, the English adventurer
began to look further afield. While England had been
asleep, <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> and Portugal had conquered great empires
in the New World, though neither country had great love
of colonising, and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> had not even skill in commerce
or seafaring. The English mariners found that it was
easier to make money by robbing the richly-freighted
galleons of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> than to trade honestly on their own
account, or run the risks and dangers of experiments in
distant colonisation. The wealth and defencelessness of
the Spanish trading-ships made them an easy prey, and
religious zeal excused cupidity by reckoning it a merit
to despoil Papists. Moreover, the Spaniards kept their
American colonies under strict tutelage, and they retained
for the mother country an absolute monopoly of trade with
them. The dearness and scarcity that flowed from monopoly
made the Spanish colonists themselves welcome the heretic
free-traders, who cheapened commodities and brought
them  the stores of which they stood in need.  Partly
as pirates, partly as smugglers, English mariners were
beginning to make a name for themselves, and side by
side with these lawless traders went more legitimate commerce
and love of adventure.
</p><p>4. Among the most daring of English seamen in the days of Henry
VIII. was William Hawkins of Plymouth, who made three voyages to
the Guinea coast and Brazil, and opened up the first trade between
England and South America.  His second son, Johin Hawkins (<date value="1532">1532</date>-<date value="1595">1595</date>),


  <pb id="p.117" n="117"/>
 followed in his father's footsteps, making, when still a young
man, voyages to the Canaries, where he learnt "that negroes were
very good merchandise in Hispaniola, and that they
might easily be had upon the coast of Guinea." In
<note place="foot" n="7">The three slave trading voyagesof John Hawkins
<date value="1564">1564</date>, and,<date value="1567">1567</date>-</note>
<date value="1562">1562</date>, he equipped a squadron of three ships, and
freighted them with negro slaves obtained in VWest <date value="1562">1562</date>,
Africa by violence and purchase. These he sold to
excellent advantage to the Spanish planters of Hispaniola, who were
at their wits' end for want of suitable labour. So enormous were
Hawkins' profits, that in <date value="1564">1564</date> he started on a larger expedition for the
same purpose, the Queen lending hin his chief ship, the Jesus. He
again obtained his mIiserable cargo of slaves, though this time with
more difficulty, but the Spanish officials were forewarned, and strove
to prevent the bold smuggler from selling his wares in America.
Hawkins answered that they must either fight him or buy his
cargo, whereupon the Spaniards allowed him to dispose of the negroes
without further trouble. He reached home laden with wealth, and
was herceforward a famous nian.  In <date value="1567">1567</date> he started on a third
voyage, but this time he met with disaster. Attempting to force the
inhabitants of San Ju/an de U/,loa (the modern Vera Cruz, the port of
Mexico) to buy hlis slaves, he was entrapped in the harbour by a strong
Spanish fleet. A desperate encounter was fought in the narrow port,
in which Haukins was ultimately overborne by numbers. He lost his
profits and most of his ships, and got back to England with the
greatest difficulty.  Hawkins was a shrewd, keen-sighted trader,
aiming simply at filling his purse by fair nleans or foul, malicious,
rude, covetous, and false. But he was terribly efficient at his work.
By opening out the slave trade, he changed the whole future of
tropical America, making possible the planter-aristocracy, enriched
by negro labour, which now rapidly succeeded the gold-seekers and
adventurers of the early days of Spanish settlement, and pointing the
way to a traffic which heaped up unhallowed gains on English
merchants for more than two hundred years. No one then thought
of the wickedness and cruelty of the trade.</p><p>
5. The Spanish Government bitterly resented Hawkins'
interference with their monopoly of trade, no less than his
demonstration of the military weakness of their 					<note place="foot" n="8">Development of the adventurousspirit after <date value="1572">1572</date>.</note>
colonial power.   Many lesser men followed
his example; and the Spaniards retaliated by
laying violent hands on English seamen and handing them
over to be tried and burnt as heretics by the Inquisition. This
state of things grew up when Philip and <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> were
comparatively friendly. After <date value="1572">1572</date> the attacks on Spanish
trade became more constant, as the revolted Dutch joined
hands with the English marauders, and even surpassed
them by their skill and dexterity in opening up avenues of
commerce. As time went on, the greedy commercial spirit
was in somewise ennobled by romantic love of adventure,
and a sort of crusading enthusiasm.    The enthusiasm for



<pb id="p.118" n="118"/>                <note place="foot" n="9">
[<date value="1566">1566</date>--<date value="1580">1580</date>.] </note>
discovery first prompted the voyages of Martin Frobisher
(<dateRange from="1535" to="1594">1535-1594</dateRange>), while Francis Drake
(<dateRange from="1540" to="1596">1540-1596</dateRange>) stood foremost
among these Puritan crusaders, equally alert for gain, glory,
and war against the Papists.</p><p>
In <date value="1566">1566</date> Sir Humphrey Gilbert, a high-souled and adventurous
Devonshire gentleman, wrote a Discourse of a Discoveryfor a New Passage to
 Cathay, in which he urged that efforts should be made
 to discover a North- [Vest passage to China by way of
<note place="foot" n="10">Frobisher's Northern Voyages,<dateRange  from="1576" to="1578">1576-1578</dateRange>.</note>                                                   the north coast of America. Ten years later, Leicester's
   brother, Ambrose Dudley, Earl of Warwick, fitted out
two tiny ships, each of twenty-five tons burden, and sent Frobisher,
a strong, rude <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName>man, already famous as a sailor and
privateer, to find out the new way to the East. On his first short
voyage Frobisher barely touched the fringe of the undiscovered
country, but brought back with him a black ore, which an Italian
alchemist declared to contain gold. This at once excited the cupidity
of those who supplied the mariners with resources, and Frobisher's
two subsequent voyages, in <date value="1577">1577</date> and <date value="1578">1578</date>, were turned from the fruitful
work of discovery to an eager quest of the gold-bearing mineral.
It was found that the ore produced no gold at all; and the speculators
and adventurers, who had furnished Frobisher with funds, turned
against him, and neglected him utterly.</p><p>
6. Francis Drake, a Tavistock man, whose father was a
dependent of the rising house of Russell, was a kinsman of
<note place="foot" n="11">Drake's Voyage to the West Indies, <date value="1572">1572</date></note>
John Hawkins, and accompanied him on his
third slave-trading voyage, barely escaping
with his little fifty-ton ship, theJudith, from the
carnage in Vera Cruz harbour.    He afterwards strove to
make good his losses in that fatal trip by two voyages
on his own account to the West Indies. In <date value="1572">1572</date> he sailed
with two small ships on a third journey from Plymouth,
"with intent to land at Nombre de Dios" [a port on the
isthmus of Darien], "the granary of the West Indies,
wherein the golden harvest brought from Peru and Mexico
to Panama was hoarded up till it could be conveyed to
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>."   He duly reached his destination, and, after a
sharp fight with the Spaniards, took possession of Nombre
de Dios, where he seized great stacks of silver bars and
took a treasure-barge, heaped up with gold, pearls, and
jewels. Drake fainted from a wound he had received in
the skirmish, and his followers, fearful of the Spaniards,
bore him back to his ships. He afterwards landed again,
and ascended a mountain, at the summit of which he
climbed a tall tree, and from its top looked down on the
Pacific. He fervently prayed " Almighty God to give him
life and leave to sail once in an English ship in that sea,"



           <pb id="p.119" n="119"/>
which had hitherto been navigated by the ships of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>
alone. In <date value="1573">1573</date> he was back at Plymouth, with enough
spoil to make him a rich man for life. Four
 <note place="foot" n="12">Drake's VoyageRound the World,
 <date value="1577">1577</date>-<date value="1580">1580</date></note>
years later, Drake set forth on the most famous
of his voyages, with a little fleet of five vessels,
of which the largest, his own ship the Pelican,
was of no more than one hundred tons, though sumptuously
fitted with " rich furniture, silver vessels, and divers shows of
all sorts of curious workmanship." This time he made his
way to South America, and bravely sailed through the
dangerous Straits of Magellan into the unknown ocean, on
which he had prayed to navigate his fleet. He had already
encountered many risks, had wrestled with furious storms,
and put down a dangerous mutiny. Alone of his little
fleet, the Pelican (which on entering the straits he had renamed
the Golden Hind) was left. He now worked his
way northwards up the western coast of South America,
and soon wrought terrible havoc on the Spaniards, who
had few means of defence, not dreaming that an enemy
would ever appear to contest their power.  A Spanish
gentleman, who commanded one of the ships that Drake
captured, sent a vivid account of the daring Englishman
to the Governor of New <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. "The English general is
about thirty-five years of age, of small size, with a reddish
beard, and is one of the greatest sailors that exist. His ship
sails well. His crew are all in the prime of life, and as well
trained for war as old soldiers of Italy. He treats them
with affection, and they him with respect. He has with
him nine or ten young gentlemen who form his council,
but he is not bound by their advice. He has no privacy:
all these dine at his table. He has all possible luxuries,
even to perfumes. None of these gentlemen either sits
down or puts on his hat in his presence without repeated
permission." The Golden Hind being now laden with
spoil, Drake resolved to sail home across the Pacific and
round the Cape of Good Hope. He successfully overcame
the many difficulties of this long and unknown
voyage, and in September <date value="1580">1580</date> safely got back to England,
being the first captain that had sailed round the world,
Magellan, his predecessor in this adventure, having died
in the attempt, though his ship successfully completed the
circumnavigation. Drake's praises were now in every one s
mouth. The queen herself dubbed him a knight on the
deck of the Golden Hind at Deptford.
</p><p>7. The Spaniards clamoured for Drake's punishment,



<pb id="p.120" n="120"/>     <note place="foot" n="13"> <date value="1580">1580</date>-.<date value="1587">1587</date>.]</note>
and for restitution of the property that he had taken, but
he came back at a time when the crisis with <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> was
<note place="foot" n="14">The breach between England and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>,<dateRange from="1580" to="1587">1580-1587</dateRange></note>
approaching. It was the period of the Jesuit
mission to the three kingdoms, and even
 <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> could not but feel that the time had
gone for affecting to be on good terms with
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. She answered Philip with fair words, and continued
to encourag  rke eas much as she could. If she had small
sympathy to spare for the heroic Netherlanders, she had a
real regard for the hero who enriched her coffers and
opened out new avenues to English adventurers and
traders.</p><p>
During the next few years, the Angevin marriage scheme,
the active intervention of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> in the Netherlands, the
proved assistance which Philip gave to the would-be assassins
of the queen, and the continued sufferings of English sailors
in the dungeons of the Inquisition, all contributed to
embitter the relations of the two countries. In <date value="1580">1580</date> Philip
annexed Portugal, and found a new offence in the support
which <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> gave to Dom Antonio, the representative of
the ancient royal house, who sought in vain to assert his
claims to the throne. After the expulsion of the Spanish
ambassador in r584, war was imminent. Philip proceeded
to lay an embargo on all English ships and property
found in his dominions. Drake was, in <date value="1585">1585</date>, sent by the
queen with a fleet of twenty-five ships to make reprisals,
and Frobisher, now restored to credit, was his vice-admiral.
Drake plundered the Spanish port of Vigo, and thence
sailed to the West Indies, whence he came back in <date value="1586">1586</date>, after
having destroyed many Spanish settlements, but with booty
hardly commensurate with the greatness of the expedition.
Next year, the execution of the Oueen of Scots filled up the
measure of the heretic queen's enormities, and Philip prepared
for revenge. At last, after nearly twenty years of
lawless hostility, England and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> stood at open war
with each other.</p><p>
In his deliberate way, Philip made ready for a great
invasion of England. In April <date value="1587">1587</date> Drake went to Cadiz,
where he sailed straight into the port, sank or burnt mole
than thirty ships, and ruined the Spanish preparations. This
exploit he called "singeing the King of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>'s
<note place="foot" n="15">Singeing the King of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>'s beard,<date value="1587"> 1587.</date></note>									beard." He then turned southwards,and struck
upon a new source of plunder by capturing a
huge carrack, laden with a rich cargo from the Portuguese
East Indies. Philip at once renewed his preparations, and



       <pb id="p.121" n="121"/>
Drake urged a fresh expedition, rightly believing that by
constantly attacking the Spanish harbours, he could free
England from all danger of invasion. <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, fearing
lest in the fleet's absence Spanish troops might he suddenly
thrown into the country, overruled his proposal, and left
Philip undisturbed to fit out his Armada.</p><p>
8. Thanks to <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s hesitation, the Spanish fleet
was ready to sail by the summer of <date value="1588">1588</date>.  Philip's plan
was to send the fleet to <placeName key="Flanders">Flanders</placeName>, whence it
<note place="foot" n="16">Preparations the Armada.</note>
was to carry Parma, with his well-tried army, for
across the straits, and thus effect an invasion of England.
It was hoped that the English Catholics would revolt on
the landing of a Spanish army, and with that expectation,
William Allen, the founder of the Douai seminary, was
made a Cardinal, and was intended to play over again the
part of Reginald Pole in the hoped-for reconquest of
England to the Roman faith. Allen put his name to a
violent pamphlet exhorting the English to accept Philip as
the executor of the papal sentence. After the beheading
of Mary, Philip's hands were free, for he no longer had a
lurking fear lest <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s death should hand over
England to<placeName key="France">France</placeName>. He laid open claim to the English
throne himself, by virtue of his threefold descent from the
legitimate stock of John of Gaunt. As a matter of mere
genealogy, he was nearer the blood of Edward III. than
the Tudors, but the English throne has never gone, like a
piece of land, to the nearest heir, least of all to a foreign
prince, alien in religion and sentiment. Even the Catholics
paid little heed to Allen's exhortations. It was no longer
mainly a war of religion, though religious hatred still
embittered the struggle on both sides. It wsas a national
war between two great nations, which had become for more
than a generation rivals from every point of view.</p><p>
England had no trained    army to mnatch Parma s
veterans, and there was still a fear of a Catholic rising.
Her best hope, therefore, was to fight Philip at sea, where
Englishmen had shown that there was no reason to be
afraid of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. Yet terror magnified the size and numbers
of Philip's fleet, though practical sailors knew from experience
that the Izvincib/eArmaida, as some braggart Spaniards
called it, was nothing very formidable. It was true that
the English ships looked much smaller than the Spanish,
because while the Spanish ships were piled up high, fore and
aft, with deck above deck, the 1,nglish were comparatively
low in the water, and had a less unwieldy superstructure at



<pb id="p.122" n="122"/>          <note place="foot" n="17">  [<date value="1587">1587</date>--<date value="1588">1588</date>.]</note>
the ends. Yet as far as tonnage went, the English ships
were on the average only a trifle smaller than those of the
Spaniards, while the largest ships of both navies were about
the same in size. Hawkins (who after his failure at Vera Cruz
had married the Treasurer of the Navy's daughter, and had
succeeded to his office) had supplied the Royal Navy with
an excellent series of new ships, built and rigged with all
the practical improvements which his skill and experience
had suggested. The result was that the English ships were
more seaworthy, easier to navigate, and able to sail quicker
and nearer to the wind. The English vessels had more
sailors than the enemy, and their guns were more numerous,
larger and better served. The smaller English ships, of the
type that had composed the fleets of Drake and Hawkins,
were out and away more efficient than the smaller Spanish
ones. Even the armed merchantmen had done good service
as privateers or pirates. The crews were experienced
mariners, grown accustomed to the boisterous seas of the
north in the fishing grounds off Iceland or Newfoundland.
The Spaniards, on the other hand, regarded the fleet as
mainly important in making an invasion possible. Their
fleet was numerically imposing, but many of their ships
were mere transports or victuallers, which could take
no part in naval warfare.  Moreover, even their
men-of-war carried as small a number of sailors as could work
the ships, and these mariners had mostly won their sole
experience of the sea in the Mediterranean or the Tropics.
Every vessel was crowded with soldiers to swell Parma's
army of invasion, and the seamen were treated as inferiors
and roughly ruled by their soldier passengers. The ships,
too, were so hastily fitted out, that they were often unseaworthy,
or at least ill-found for a long voyage. The only
great Spanish seaman, whose rank was high enough to
ensure him the supreme command, was the Marquis of
Santa Cruz, who died on the eve of sailing. Philip foolishly
gave his office to the high-born and well-meaning young
Duke of Mldedina Sidonia, who knew little of the sea, had
no experience in war, and was not clever enough to profit
by the advice of wiser men. The best and bravest of the
Spanish nobility commanded the ships and squadrons, but
they were mere soldiers, anxious to get ashore and begin
what they thought would be the real struggle. If they had
to fight at sea, their great object was to board the enemy
and carry on a hand-to-hand struggle on deck.  They
despised artillery as a cowardly sort of weapon. It was



                  <pb id="p.123" n="123"/>
therefore the policy of the English to avoid close fighting,
where the greater numbers of the Spanish soldiers and
their discipline and experience in warfare would be sure to
tell.</p><p>
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> gave the chief command to the Lord High
Admiral, Charles Howard, Lord Howard of Effingham, the
grandson of the Norfolk who won the battle of Flodden,
and cousin of the Norfolk executed in <date value="1572">1572</date>. His father
and two of his uncles had already held the
<note place="foot" n="18">The English Commanders.</note>
office of Admiral, and he was not unworthy of
his post, being dignified, shrewd, cautious, brave, and working
admirably with his subordinates. Many of his kinsfolk
and other great noblemen fought under him, but his chief
helpers were the two best practical sailors in England, Sir
Francis Drake, who was Vice-admiral, and John Hawkins,
who was Rear-admiral. Martin Frobisher was captain of
the Triumph, the largest ship in the fleet. A vast army was
rapidly collected on land, over which <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> set her old
favourite Leicester, who died a month after the struggle
had ended. Though the English had to raise their army
and create most appliances for carrying on war on a large
scale, even by sea, they were ready before the Spaniards.
In the early summer the Admiral posted his ships in the
"chops of the Channel," between Scilly and Ushant, and
anxiously awaited the arrival of the grand fleet. At last in
despair he put back to Plymouth. Meanwhile Lord Henry
Seymour, son of the Protector Somerset, with the Squadron
of the Narrow Seas, kept a sharp eye on Parma, who had
collected a great store of flat-bottomed boats and barges
to cross over the straits, as soon as Sidonia's arrival gave
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> even a momentary command of the sea.</p><p>
9. In May <date value="1588">1588</date>, the Armada sailed out of Lisbon, but
rough weather and insufficient equipment forced the fleet
to put back to the north Spanish ports, and it was not until
12th July that it finally started. On I9th July it was
descried entering the Channel, and a strong south-west
gale blew it rapidly up the narrow seas. The English let
it pass Plymouth, where many of their own
<note place="foot" n="19">Armada in the Channel,<date value="1588-07">July1588</date>.</note>
fleet lay, and then sailed out in pursuit. For
the next week an almost continuous battle
raged between the two fleets.  The English had the
" weather gage," that is to say, were on the side of the wind,
and while their greater power of sailing enabled them to
tack easily and escape, the wind prevented the foremost
Spaniards coming to the help of their rearward brethren, on



<pb id="p.124" n="124"/>           <note place="foot" n="20">(<date value="1588">1588</date>--<date value="1588">1588</date>.]</note>
whom the brunt of the battle fell. The English cleverly
avoided coming to close quarters, and poured their heavy
fire into the towering hulks of the Spaniards, doing dreadful
execution on the close-packed masses of soldiers that
swarmed within them. In their vain desire to fall aboard
the English, the Spaniards aimed at their masts and rigging,
hoping to cripple them, but their gun practice was not
good enough and their guns too light to have effect. Day
after day, ship after ship of the Spaniards was cut off and
captured by the English, or avoided capture by running on
the French coast. But the long artillery duel, a novelty in
those days, used up the ammunition of both fleets.
The English were forced to depend on scanty supplies
brought from shore from day to day, but the Spaniards, who
had no such resource, were much worse off. In the midst
of the struggle the Admiral summoned some of his most
valiant captains to his flagship, and dubbed them knights,
Hawkins and   Frobisher being among the number.
From the very beginning of the fighting the Spaniards
never had a chance, and after being chased all up the
Channel, they cast anchor in Calais roads, fully conscious
of their desperate condition. "The enemy pursue me,"
wrote Sidonia to Parma. "They fire upon me most days
from morning to nightfall; but they will not close and
grapple. I have given them every opportunity. I have left
ships exposed to tempt them to board, but they will not,
and there is no remedy, for they are swift and we are slow.
We have consumed our ammunition, and our men are worn
out."</p><p>
10. No rest was allowed to the unlucky Spaniards.
They lay so near the French shore that they could not be
attacked where they were moored. Thereupon
 the English sent blazing fire-ships upon the
<note place="foot" n="21">The battle offGraveline,
29th	July, and the defeat of the Armada.</note>
Spaniards at anchor, so that, in terror of utter
destruction, they slipped their cables and once
more took to the open sea. The English
were now reinforced by Seymour, and actually had more
ships than the enemy. Abandoning former tactics, Howard
prepared to give the final blow to the weakened Spaniards.
On 29th July the decisive battle was fought off Gravelines.
The English had again the weather gage, and
bore down on the Spaniards, whose fleet formed a great
half-moon.  The battle raged fiercely from nine in the
morning till six in the afternoon, and was altogether in
favour of the assailants. "Great was the spoil and harm



                     <pb id="p.125" n="125"/>
that was done to them,' wrote one of the English captains.
"When I was furthest off, I was not out of the shot of their
arquebuses, and most times within speech one of another.
Every man did well, and when every one was weary and
our cartridges spent, we ceased and followed the enemy,
who bore away in very good order."</p><p>
The struggle was now virtually over. Sidonia still kept
his ships well together, despite their damaged condition
and the loss of spirit which always follows defeat. Southerly
winds now prevailing, he found it best to sail northwards
and thence got home round the north of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> and west
of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.  Hig-h gales still continued, and proved fatal
to the leaky and battered ships, whose wrecks strewed the
Irish coast. The English soon desisted from pursuit, their
provisions and ammunition again failing, and malignant
fever having broken out in the fleet.  Less than half the
Armada got back to <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. The attack on England had
utterly and hopelessly failed.</p><p>
11. The defeat of the Armada marks the end of the
thirty years of constant difficulties by which <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
had hitherto  been beset.   There was no
<note place="foot" n="22">The results of the English victory.</note>
longer any question of whether Englishmen
could be forced to accept a king or a creed
from abroad. The failure of Philip's fleet ensured the independence
of England. It ensured the victory of Protestantism.
It made easy in the next generation the union
with <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> and the conquest of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.   It secured
a large share of the New World to our sailors and adventurers,
made England a great naval power, and enabled her
to become before long a great trading and colonising
state as well. It was the triumph of the restless energy
and high-souled patriotism of the new generation, and was
immediately followed by the mighty growth of the drama
and the unique outburst of genius that made the end of
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s reign the most wonderful period in all our
history.</p><p>
In its European aspect the defeat of Philip was the most serious
check encountered by the victorious forces of the Counter Reformation,
which nevertheless had succeeded in winning Lack to Catholicism
most of the doubtful countries of middle Europe. It
secured the treedoni of the Seven United Provinces,
<note place="foot" n="23">The freedom ofthe United Provinces</note>
and enabled them to win greater gains than even
England fi-om the weakness of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> on the sea,.										 .
Under the rule of the son of Williaml the Silent, Maurice
(<dateRange from="1587" to="1625">1587-1625</dateRange>),
the Dutch resisted the attacks of larnma and his successors, and Philip
was forced to conciliate the southern Netherlands by making them an



<pb id="p.126" n="126"/>                 <note place="foot" n="24"> [<date value="1588">1588</date>--<date value="1596">1596</date>.]</note>
almost independent state under his daughter Isabella and her husband
the Archduke Albert of Austria. Nor was the defeat of the Armada
less epoch-making in<placeName key="France">France</placeName>. In <date value="1588">1588</date> the Guises and the Catholic
League broke openly from tie wretched Henry III., who revenged
himself by procuring the murder of Francis of Guise. Henry III. was
forced to take refuge in the Huguenot camp, and next year was himself
assassinated by a Catholic fanatic. His death made the Huguenot
leader, Henry of Navarre, Henry IV. king of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>.
<note place="foot" n="25">The triumph of Henry IV. in	France.</note>
The League joined with Philip in striving to prevent
Navarre's recognition, and the Civil War blazed more
fiercely than ever. French feeling was divided, since
the mass of Frenchmen disliked a Protestant king, though they
also resented the interference of the Spaniards. Henry IV. was no
religious enthusiast, but a clear-headed, shrewd, unscrupulous statesman
after <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s own heart. In <date value="1593">1593</date> he turned Catholic, and
was soon recognised as king by all patriotic Frenchmen. Gradually
the war of Protestant and Catholic in<placeName key="France">France</placeName> developed into a national
war between<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, just in the same way as the Armada
had turned the religious struggle in England into a national war with
Philip.  Elizal eth and Henry IV. formed a close alliance against
their conmon enemy.  Thus the general European conflict of Protestant
and Catholic settled down into an ordinary war, which the
allies fought so successfully that the political balance of Europe,
which Philip had so long threatened to overthrow,
<note place="foot" n="26">The Treaty of Vervins and the Edict of Nante,<date value="1598">1598</date>.</note>
was restored on a sound footing. In <date value="1598">1598</date>, wearied
out with adversity, Philip made the Treaty of Vervins
 with<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, and died in the same year. In the same
year Henry IV. showed that he had not forgotten
his old Protestant associates, by issuing the Edict of Nantes, which
gave the Huguenots wide toleration for their religion and political
privileges that were all too liberal for the interests of national unity.</p><p>
12. England and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> continued at war until the death
of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>.  The animosity of the two nations was so
fierce that peace seemed quite out of the question.
The English Catholics joined loyally
<note place="foot" n="27">The War between Englandand <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>,<dateRange from="1588" to="1603">1588-1603</dateRange></note>
with the Protestants in fighting the Spaniards,
and only a small minority followed       firebrands,
like Allen and Parsons, in continued hostility to
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s government. The papal bull of excommunication
was forgotten. The Pope, who himself feared Philip's
power, was not wholly dissatisfied at the defeat of the
Armada. Yet the stern laws against the Catholics were
still added to, and Catholic martyrs were still sacrificed to
the English treason laws. These were more and more
victims of religious persecution, for there was no longer
the least danger of the Catholics attaining supremacy.
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s policy had so completely triumphed that they
had become an insignificant and unpopular minority.
The later stages of the war with <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> were mainly



              <pb id="p.127" n="127"/>
fought at sea. In <date value="1589">1589</date> Parliament urged that the Spaniards
should be attacked in their own country by way of reprisals,
and Drake sailed with a strong expedition to
<note place="foot" n="28">	 Drake's Expedtion in <date value="1589">1589</date>.</note>
the coast of the Peninsula. The shipping
at Corunna was burnt and a large number of troops landed
in the hope of capturing Lisbon. A fatal error was made,
however, when the English left the sea to fight on land,
with scanty numbers and less experience. The attack on
Lisbon failed, and so severely did the expedition suffer
that not half those who sailed got back to England. The
more ambitious enterprises of the later years of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s
reign were seldom as successful as the humbler efforts of
the early pioneers. The Spaniards were now better prepared
and more accustomed to the English way of fighting.
In <date value="1591">1591</date> an expedition sent to the Azores under Lord
Thomas Howard to lie in wait for the treasure-laden
galleons of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, was assailed by so strong a Spanish
squadron that Howard prudently retired
<note place="foot" n="29">The Fight of the Revenge, <date value="1591">1591</date>.</note>
before them. His vice-admiral, Sir Richard
Grenville, who sailed in the Revenge, Drake's flagship in
<date value="1588">1588</date>, delayed his departure until the Spanish fleet had
cut him off from the rest of the squadron. Though retreat
was still open to him by sailing in the contrary direction,
he resolved to cut his way through the whole Spanish fleet,
which lay stretched to windward. As he sailed under the
lee of the great galleons, he was at once becalmed, assailed
on every side, and boarded by the enemy.  For fifteen
hours Grenville and his hundred and fifty fever-stricken
men held out against the whole Spanish fleet. At last,
when scarcely twenty were left alive, and Grenville had been
mortally wounded, the Revenge was captured.  Practical
men denounced the wilful rashness of the obstinate commander
and his disobedience to his superior's orders. But
the extraordinary heroism of the resistance, told in lofty
prose by Grenville's kinsman, Sir Walter Raleigh, has immortalised
the story of the fight of the Revenge as the
most brilliant of all the deeds of English seamen.</p><p>
In <date value="1595">1595</date> Drake, with Hawkins as vice-admiral, was sent
on an expedition to the West Indies, but the
<note place="foot" n="30">Latest expedition and death of Drake and Hawkins,
<dateRange from="1595" to="1596">1595-6</dateRange>.</note>
Spaniards were prepared for them. They won
few successes and captured no treasure, and
early in the campaign Hawkins was cut off
by fever. In January <date value="1596">1596</date> Drake himself died, and was
buried at sea, so that, as a Devonshire rimer sang,
<quote rend="blockquote">"The waves became his winding-sheet ; the waters were his tomb:
But for his fame the ocean-sea was not sufficient room."</quote>



<pb id="p.128" n="128"/>           <note place="foot" n="31"> [<date value="1583">1583</date>--<date value="1599">1599</date>.]</note>
Philip II. was now growing old, but he resolved to make
a last effort to avenge himself on the English. Following
<note place="foot" n="32">The threatened Armada and the Cadiz Expedition of <date value="1596">1596</date>.</note>
on Drake's earlier tactics, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> sent a
 great expedition to destroy the Spanish fleet
in harbour, before it was ready to sail. The
Admiral, Lord Howard of Effingham, was
placed in command, though jointly with Robert Deverezur,
second <persName key="Earl of Essex">Earl of <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName></persName>, the Admiral taking the lead at sea and
<placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> on shore.  After a fierce fight, in which Raleigh
took a main part in revenge for his kinsman Sir Richard
Grenville, the ships in Cadiz harbour were destroyed and
the town itself taken by storm. <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>, young and ardent,
was for following up the attack, but Howard insisted on
going home, and on his return to England the queen made
him Earl of Nottingham. After this rude lesson, <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>
gave up all hopes of revenge, and the war languished for
the rest of the reign.</p><p>
13. The spirit of adventure and discovery continued to
inspire English mariners.  Thomas Cavendish, between
<note place="foot" n="33">Later Elizabethan voyages of Discovery.</note>
<date value="1586">1586</date> and <date value="1588">1588</date>, followed in the path of Drake,
and successfully circumnavigated the globe,
 spoiling the Spaniards after the fashion of his
great predecessors, and sailing home up the Thames with
broadcloth and silk over all his canvas, and his tops gilt.
Between <date value="1585">1585</date> and <date value="1587">1587</date>
John Davis strove to renew the
<note place="foot" n="34">Cavendish and Davis.</note>
exploits of Frobisher by opening out the
North-West Passage, and, though failing in
his impossible enterprise, he added much to men's knowledge
of the northern seas.
</p><p>14. Constant attempts were now made to plant English
colonies in the lands revealed by the hardihood of our
<note place="foot" n="35">Attempts at	American colonization.</note>
seamen. The pioneer of English colonisation
 was Sir fzumpihrey Gilbert, who as early as
<date value="1583"> 1583</date> sought to establish an English settlement
on the dreary coasts of Newfoundland. But the climate
was adverse, the colonists were lazy, lawless, and mutinous,
and Gilbert was too haughty and wayward to command
<note place="foot" n="36">Gilbert and Newfoundland,<date value="1583">1583</date>.</note>
their affection or obedience. He was forced
  to return to England with the only two ships
      that remained to him.    The season was
autumn and the voyage was stormy. Rejecting the comparastive
safety of his bigg- er ship, the Golden Hind (which
was only of forty tons burdenn, Gilbert sailed home in the
Squirrel, a mere boat of ten tons, which was overwhelmed
by the tempest. The men on the Golden Hind last saw



                <pb id="p.129" n="129"/>
Gilbert " sitting abaft with a book in his hand, and crying
to us, 'We are as near heaven by sea as by land.' But the
same night suddenly the frigate's lights went out, and in
that moment she was swallowed up."    Gilbert's halfbrother, Sir Walter RazZleih, the most
versatile and accomplished of all the Elizabethan heroes, stepped
<note place="foot" n="37">Raleigh and Virginia,
<date value="1685">1685</date>-<date value="1590">1590</date></note>
into his place. In <date value="1585">1585</date> Sir Richard Grenville,
the hero of the Revenge, who was their cousin,
attempted to establish, under Raleigh's direction, a new
colony more to the south, in a land which Raleigh named
Virginia in honour of the virgin queen. The first expedition
was an utter failure, and Drake took the colonists
back to England. In <date value="1587">1587</date> and in
<date value="1590">1590</date> other expeditions
were sent out, but neither of them succeeded. Raleigh was
too busy at home to go out himself, and the only permanent
result of his efforts was the introduction into England of
tobacco and the potato.  Undeterred by his Virginian
failure, Raleigh now started an entirely different enterprise,
and in <date value="1595">1595</date> sailed to South America, hoping to explore the
valley of the Orinoco, and the region then called Guiana,
in which he believed there existed a wonderful city called
El Dorado, where gold abounded beyond the dreams of
avarice. His enemies mocked at his enthusiasm, and on
his return he wrote his Discovery of Guziana as a justification
of his action. For the rest of the queen's reign
Raleigh abandoned adventure and discovery for vain
endeavours to gain power at court whereby he might rise to
authority in the state and carry out his great ideas.</p><p>
15. The old servants of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> were now passing
away. Leicester died in <date value="1588">1588</date>,
and Walsingham in <date value="1590">1590</date>.
Burghley alone remained, and sought to
<note place="foot" n="38">The Cabinet and the Court of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s old age.</note>
hand on his power to his second son, Robert
Cecil, the Secretary of State.  As Burghley
grew older, he became more cautious, set his face against
a policy of adventure, and would willingly have made
peace with <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. After his death in
<date value="1598">1598</date> Robert Cecil continued
to uphold his views, while the more active party was
represented by <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> and Raleigh. Raleigh,
<note place="foot" n="39">The fall of the <persName key="Earl of Essex">Earl of <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName></persName>,<date value="1601">1601</date>-</note>
with all his gifts, was headstrong, self-seeking,
and unpopular. He quarrelled with <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>,
and lost his position at court. <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>, Leicester's step-son,
was the favourite of the queen's old age. The great-grand-son
of Anne Boleyn's sister, he was one of her nearest
living kinsmen. Loving him for his beauty, gallantry and
devotion to her, she in <date value="1599">1599</date> entrusted him with the difficult

task of suppressing the Irish rebellion [see page 150].
The wayward young man mismanaged things utterly, and
after losing most of his troops, hurried back to court without
leave, to justify himself to his mistress.  <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
was mortally offended at this breach of orders, and put
him in prison. In 600o he was released, but ordered not
to go to court. He was like a spoilt child, and now sought
to win back by force the favour which his sovereign still
withheld from him. In I60o he strove to excite a revolt
of the Londoners, hoping with their help to drive Cecil
from power and recover his position.  The attempt completely
failed, and <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> was convicted and executed as
a traitor. His tragic fall established Cecil more firmly
than ever in the old queen's favour.</p><p>
16. As the danger from abroad lessened, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> had
increasing trouble with her own subjects. Besides the
<note place="foot" n="41"><persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> andthe Parliaments, <dateRange from="1559" to="1601">1559-1601</dateRange>. </note>
fierce conflict waged between Whitgift and
the Puritans, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> now began to have
  difficulties with her Parliaments. In the early
years of her reign, the queen had striven to base her civil
government on the support of Parliament.  She soon
found that the days of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. were over, and that
neither Lords nor Commons would submissively ratify her
commands. Her early Parliaments irritated her by persistently
urging her to marry or at least to name a successor.
They also gave great offence by criticising her ecclesiastical
policy, recommending conciliation towards the Puritans, and
urging her to uphold a frankly Protestant policy at home and
abroad. Yet at all grave crises they gave her strong and even
enthusiastic support, and were ever willing to vote supplies
to carry out a forward policy. <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, therefore, aimed
at getting parliamentary assistance on great occasions, but
in ordinary times she summoned Parliaments as seldom as
she could. There were only thirteen sessions of Parliament
during the forty-five years of her reign, and on one
occasion nearly five years elapsed between two meetings of
Parliament. As <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> seldom ventured to raise money
save by parliamentary grant, this policy involved her practising
a rigid economy. If the Commons got out of hand, she
did not scruple to rebuke them, to silence them, or to send
leading members to the Tower. As the reign went on
the character of the parliamentary opposition somewhat
changed. It complained less of the queen's ecclesiastical
policy, and more of her domestic administration, which,
like that of all the Tudors, cared little for the forms of law,



      <pb id="p.131" n="131"/>
and, though generally efficient, was arbitrary and capricious.
Signs were gathering that the Tudor despotism was
ceasing to be necessary. The character of the House of
Commons changed very much for the better. Nearly all
the strongest and most daring of the Elizabethan heroes-
Drake, Hawkins, Raleigh, Grenville, among the numbers-
were Members of Parliament, and it was absurd to suppose
that a body containing such men would be content to
register the royal oiders, and not aspire to have a share
in the work of government. Parliament now became exceedingly
jealous of its rights; and every special privilege
belonging to members, save perhaps that of freedom
of speech, was successfully vindicated before <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
died. However, the rare tact of the queen long deferred
the crisis. She had the true Tudor insight into public
opinion, and all her haughty speeches did not prevent her
constantly employing the most watchful care in adapting
her measures to suit the wishes of her subjects. Nevertheless
she did not neglect more direct means of influencing
the Commons. She did her best to get members returned
who would accept her policy.  She created over thirty
new boroughs, which were called upon to return members,
not because of their importance, but because they were under
her influence, and could help her to pack the Commons'
house. Her chief minister, Sir Robert Cecil, sat in every
Parliament, and was perhaps the earliest English statesman
of the first rank who devoted himself to the task, afterwards
so important, of managing the House of Commons
and keeping it in a good temper. <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> was very
chary in granting new peerages, and the bishops, who
were a third of the House of Lords, combined with the
courtiers in giving her a majority, despite the more critical
attitude of the older families. Yet, despite all these precautions
the last Parliaments of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> saw the outbreak
of a severe contest between Queen and Commons that
clearly foreshadowed the troubles of the next century.
</p><p>17. Among the thrifty queen's favourite ways of rewarding
her courtiers was the grant of a Monoj5oly, that is the
exclusive permission to sell a certain article,
<note place="foot" n="42">The Monopolies and the Parliamentary contest<date value="1601">1601</date>.</note>
the result of which was that the holder of the
right could raise its price and enrich himself,
as he had no fear of competition. The grant in
cost <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> nothing, and was often very lucrative to the
recipient. A famous example of such a grant was the monopoly
of sweet wines, which she had given to <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> in the



<pb id="p.132" n="132"/>        <note place="foot" n="43">[<date value="1597">1597</date>--<date value="1603">1603</date>.]  </note>
days of his favour, but refused to renew after his failure in
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>. These monopolies became so numerous and
included so many common articles of necessity that the
burden to the nation became a very real one, and in <date value="1597">1597</date>
Parliament remonstrated with the queen against the abuse
of the practice. The queen answered civilly but evasively,
"hoping that her subjects would not take away her prerogative,
the choicest flower of her garden, and promising to
examine all patents and abide by the touchstone of the
law." In I60o another Parliament met and found that
patents of monopoly were more freely conferred than ever.
When the list of monopolies was read before the Commons
a member cried out, "Is not bread among the number?
Nay, but it will be, if no remedy is found for these before
the next Parliament." Sir Robert Cecil and his cousin,
Francis Bacon, vigorously defended monopolies, but the
outcry became so high that even a courtier like Raleigh
deemed it prudent to publicly renounce his patents. <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
wisely gave way before the storm. She told the
Commons that she would revoke all the monopolies that
she found weigh heavily upon her people. She graciously
thanked the Commons for their action. " Had I not," said
she, "received a knowledge from you, I might have fallen
into the lap of an error, only for want of true information."
In granting her a liberal subsidy, the grateful Commons
clearly expressed what they and <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> both felt was
the true relation between Crown and Parliament. "We
consider," they said, "that your Majesty and we your
subjects are but one body politic, and that your Highness is
the head and we the members, and that no good or felicity,
peril or adversity can come to the one but the other shall
partake thereof." With these striking words the last Tudor
Parliament came to an end.</p><p>
18. <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> was now growing an old woman, but she
still walked, rode, danced, and hunted with something of
<note place="foot" n="44">The last years and death of<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, <date value="1603">1603</date>.</note>
her former vigour. In <date value="1602">1602</date> even her robust
constitution began to fail. She refused all
 medicine, took little food, but declined to go
to bed, and sought to conceal her desperate plight. Her
ministers were troubled about the future of the monarchy,
for she still persisted in her early policy of refusing to
designate her successor. By <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>'s will, Edward
Seymour, Lord Beauchamp (the grandson of the Protector
Somerset), whose mother was Catharine, Lady Jane Grey's
sister, was the lawful heir to the throne.  But no one



               <pb id="p.133" n="133"/>
seriously pressed his claims, and the legitimacy of his birth
was somewhat doubtful. Cecil had long been anxious for
the succession of the King of Scots, whose hereditary right
and Protestantism made him the most acceptable candidate,
even apart from the advantage of the union of the
two kingdoms, which his succession involved. The dying
queen was urged to express her will. She gave no sign
when her ministers spoke of the King of Scots, but when
Seymour's name was mentioned, she cried, with something
of her old energy, " I will have no rascal's son in my seat,
but one worthy to be a king." On  <date value="1603-03-24">24th March1603</date> her
unconquerable spirit yielded itself to death.

<head>CHAPTER VIII.
<placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> and <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> under the Tudors.</head>
<p>The Tudor Kings were not satisfied to establish their
rule merely over England.  Like Edgar or <persName key="Edward I">Edward I</persName>.,
they aspired to reduce the whole of the British
<note place="foot" n="1">The Tudors and the British Islands.</note>
Islands under their sway. We have seen how
<persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s plan to unite England and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> had been
made futile by the brutality of his methods,
though under <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> the Reformation first really bound
the two countries together, and rendered possible the union
of the two realms under <persName key="Henry VII">Henry VII</persName>.'s great-great-grandson
after her death. We must now see how <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. joined
<placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> and other great franchises with his English kingdom,
and how, after nearly a century of struggle, the last days of
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> witnessed the completion of the effective English
conquest of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.</p><p>
2. Since the suppression of the revolt of Owen Glendower,
<placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> and the March of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> had been the scene of no
very striking events.  Harsh penal laws,
<note place="foot" n="2">The Principality,the March, and Cheshire before<date value="1536">1536</date></note>
passed when the fear of Owen and his
Welshmen was still a living force, had imposed
 on the Welsh all sorts of disabilities.
The English towns and castles were kept apart as a garrison,
and intermarriage between the two races was sternly forbidden.
Yet the arm of the English King was far too weak to
enforce such cruel statutes, and in reality the Welsh lived a
disorderly and independent life, caring very little for any sort
of law. The old distinction between the Principality and



<pb id="p.134" n="134"/>      <note place="foot" n="3"> [<date value="1485">1485</date>--<date value="1536">1536</date>.]</note>
the March was still kept up. In the Principality, the
eldest son of the English King ruled as <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName></persName>.
<persName key="Edward I">Edward I</persName>., the conqueror of the Principality, had divided
his land into the five shires of Anglesey, Carnarvon,
Merioneth, Cardigan, and Carmarthen, and had set up a
rude imitation of the English system of local institutions.
Very similar was the state of things in the County Palatine
of Chester, of which the county of Flint was a sort of dependency.
It was, like the Principality, ruled by the King's
eldest son, but under his title of <persName key="Earl of Chester">Earl of Chester</persName>, and was as
distinct as <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> itself from the general English system,
being a little feudal state, standing by itself ever since
Norman times. Exactly the same was the condition of the
many petty feudal lordships that jointly formed the March
of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>, and still remained as relics of the first Norman
conquest of southern and eastern <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> in the reigns of
William  II. and Henry I. Each lordship marcher was
governed on its own system, bound to the English crown
by the homage done by its lord, but having no relations
with the Principality.  The enormous number of petty
jurisdictions made the March even more lawless than
the Principality. It was easy for robbers and murderers by
crossing the next boundary to withdraw themselves into a
separate state, where a different justice was administered
by another set of officers. As time went on, the various lordships
marcher fell into the possession of the great baronial
families of England, and, still later, many of them escheated
to the crown, especially in <date value="1399">1399</date> when the marcher lordships
of the Dukes of <placeName key="Lancaster">Lancaster</placeName>, and in I46i when the
Mortimer marcher district, including all central <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>, was
united to the crown by <persName key="Edward IV">Edward IV</persName>. Thus, before the
accession of the Tudors, the king or his heir were direct
lords of nearly all <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>, either as <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName></persName>, Earl of
Chester, or lord of the various marcher lordships. Yet
no attempt was made to weld the different districts together
in a single system.</p><p>
3. Both Yorkists and Tudors were specially connected
with <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>; the Yorkists as heirs of the Mortimers, and the
<note place="foot" n="4">The Council of<placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> at Ludlow </note>
Tudors, because on the male side they were
.of pure Welsh descent, the laws against the

intermarriage of Welsh and English not preventing Owen
Tudor, the Anglesey squire, from marrying the widow of
Henry V., and their son Edmund from wedding the heiress
of the Beauforts, who, after the slaughter of the Wars of the
Roses, handed on to her son <persName key="Henry VII">Henry VII</persName>. the representation



          <pb id="p.135" n="135"/>
of the House of <placeName key="Lancaster">Lancaster</placeName>. <persName key="Edward IV">Edward IV</persName>. started the beginnings
of a better system when he sent down a council to
Ludlow, the old home of the Mortimers, to act as advisers
and assistants of his little son, the<persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName></persName> who
perished in the Tower. Henry V II. continued the Council,
and by naming his heir Arthur showed that he was not
unmindful of his father's ancestry. <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>., when he


<figure id="Fig.013" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.012.DO01.00013"><head>Wales and the March before Henry VIII's Reforms</head></figure>


had no son to be <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName></persName>, made the Lady Mary
Princess of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> and kept on the Council in her name.
Gradually the Council changed its character, and from
being the personal council of prince or princess, it grew
into a body specially entrusted with the administration both
of the Principality and the March, being called the Council
of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> and sitting permanently at Ludlow, which thus



<pb id="p.136" n="136"/>       <note place="foot" n="5">  [<date value="1536">1536</date>--<date value="1603">1603</date>.]</note>
became the capital of sixteenth century <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>; while the
President of the Council, generally a political bishop or a
great nobleman, became in practice its governor. The
Council at Ludlow quite changed the character of the
district under its charge, putting down with a strong
hand the constant family feuds, robbery, and bloodshed
that had put the whole land permanently at the mercy of
a swarm of petty local tyrants, and making <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> as
peaceful as any part of Henry's dominions.</p><p>
4. In <date value="1536">1536</date> <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. carried a series of laws
<note place="foot" n="6">The Union of England and <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>, <date value="1536">1536</date></note>
through Parliament which entirely changed
the legal position of both the Principality
and Marches. Hitherto they had belonged
to the English kings, but had been no part of England,
but rather a dependency of it. Henceforth, so far as
law could make two nations one, complete equality was
established between them. The petty lordships marcher
were practically abolished. Henceforth the marcher had
no more authority over his property than the lord of any
English manor. All <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> was made "shire ground," a
phrase that in Tudor times meant the bringing in of the
whole English system of local government. The old shires
of the Principality were reorganised, and in some cases
enlarged. New shires were built up out of the lordships
marcher, the greatest of which became the centres round
which the new counties were grouped. The ancient palatine
earldom of Pembroke and lordship of Glamorgan were
made the nucleus of the modern Pembrokeshire and
Glamorganshire. The new shires of Montgomery, Radnor,
Brecon, and Monmouth were established. Other marcher
lordships were annexed to the English counties of Shropshire,
Hereford, and Gloucester, which thus first attained
their modern dimensions. The thirteen counties, old and
new, into which <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> and its March were now divided,
each received precisely the same organisation as an English
shire, with sheriffs, justices, sessions, coroners, and the
rest. Moreover, they were called upon to return members
to the English Parliament, one knight for every shire (two
for Monmouth), and one burgess from their grouped
boroughs. Cheshire was also allowed to return members
for the first time. The only thing that was now peculiar to
<placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> was the continuance of a special judicial system with
special judges for <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> and<placeName key="Chester">Chester</placeName>, which went on till
the reign of <persName key="William IV">William IV</persName>. But under <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>., Monmouthshire
was included in an English circuit, and so cut



     <pb id="p.137" n="137"/>
off from the remaining counties. Henceforth <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> enjoyed
the same law and privilege as England. The union of the
two countries was complete.</p><p>
5. <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s reforming measures had little effect in
altering public feeling in <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>. The people accepted the
abolition of the Papacy and the monasteries,
<note place="foot" n="7">The Reformation in <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> and NationalRevival under <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>.</note>
but went on with their old beliefs, just as if
nothing had happened, thus almost realising
the king's ideal of religion. Under Mary,
the Welsh returned without difficulty to the old faith.
So few were the Protestants that the whole land only
supplied three martyrs to the Marian persecution, one
of whom was the English bishop of St. Davids, Ferrar,
while the other two were humble sufferers from the English
towns of Cardiff and Haverfordwest. Under <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> the
real reformation in <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> began, being set on foot by a
few zealous Welshmen, who had learnt Protestantism under
<persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>. or at Geneva. They saw that the new gospel
could only reach the people if taught in their native Welsh;
accordingly they set to work to translate religious books into
the vernacular. The two chief Welsh reformers were the
laymen William Salisbury of Llanrwst and Richard Davies,
also a Carnarvonshire man, who had been an exile at
Geneva under Mary, and was after <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s accession
made bishop, first of St. Asaph and then of St. Davids, and
became chief adviser of Cecil and Parker on Welsh affairs.
By their care the first Welsh New Testament and the
Welsh version of the Prayer Book were published in <date value="1567">1567</date>.
Unluckily, the two friends now quarrelled. The result was
that it was not until <date value="1588">1588</date>, a few months after the defeat of
the Armada, that the single-handed zeal of William Morgan,
afterwards Bishop of St. Asaph, enabled a Welsh Translation
of the whole Bible to be printed. It was now possible
to preach with effect in Welsh; and before the end of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s
reign the Welsh were quite won over from Rome,
though it was a harder matter to preach them out of those
ancient customs, that to Puritans, like Davies, seemed mere
relics of Popery. Puritanism, however, hardly existed in
<placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>, save in the English-speaking districts of the south
and east, which were in closer touch with Puritan England.
John Penry, the only famous Welsh Puritan of the time,
[see page 82] drew a most gloomy picture of the religious
condition of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>, and urged on Parliament to take
further action for spreading Protestant ideas, for, said
he, "unless the magistrate doth uphold Christ's honour



<pb id="p.138" n="138"/>     <note place="foot" n="8"> [<date value="1485">1485</date>--<date value="1494">1494</date>.] </note>
against Satan, it will fall to the ground." His account,
however, is that of a morose fanatic. In reality, though
much of Welsh life was still rude and coarse, the country
was in a condition of rapid progress. It had for the first
time enjoyed peace and sound law, and the beginnings
of the Reformation in <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> led to a strong national
revival that made its influence felt on every side for
good. Schools were set up; a Welsh college founded
at Oxford; Welsh grammars, dictionaries, histories were
written; Welsh literature again flourished; many Welshmen
rose to eminence in the service of their Church, both in
<placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> and England. Agriculture prospered now peace was
secure and markets accessible. As Churchyard, the Welsh
poet, sang in describing the worthiness of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>:-
<quote rend="blockquote">" Markets are good, and victuals nothing dear,
Each place is filled with plenty all the year;
The ground manured, the grain so doth increase
That thousands live in wealth and blessed peace."</quote>
The coal mines of Flintshire and Glamorganshire were
developed. The Society for the Mines Royal, set up in
<date value="1567">1567</date>, opened up the lead mines of Cardiganshire. The
extinction of piracy made the coasts safe for trade. Many
Welshmen emigrated into England and won good positions
in camp, court, and mart. Everywhere the policy of the
Welsh line of English kings had proved abundantly successful.
</p><p>
6. English rule in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> had fallen to its lowest ebb
during the Wars of the Roses. Only in one corner of
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> was any pretence of English government kept up.
This was the English Pale, a region that ran along the
east coast from Dundalk to Dublin and the Wicklow hills
beyond, while on the land side a steep dyke marked its
<note place="foot" n="9">State of<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> at the end ofthe fifteenthcentury.</note>
boundary in long straight lines. Within this
little district, the commands of the Lord
  Deputy and his Council were fairly well
  obeyed; and a system, based on English
law, was kept up. The Irish Parliaments now represented
little save the Pale and a few scattered boroughs. Outside
the Pale, lands that had once been shire-ground had
become split up into a considerable number of petty states,
practically independent, always quarrelling with each
other, and seldom troubling themselves even to make a
formal acknowledgment of the power of the English crown.
They were governed in two ways, the one as lawless as



     <pb id="p.139" n="139"/>
the other. Some were small feudal states, turbulent and
anarchic as feudal lordships ever were, which were ruled
by the heads of the great Anglo-Norman houses, settled
in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> ever since the reign of Henry II. The others
were the Irish tribal communities,governed after a disorderly
and patriarchal fashion by elective chieftains, chosen by their
tribesmen from the ruling family of the sept or clan. Down
to the sixteenth century, the account which Gerald of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>
gave of the Irish of Henry II.'s time still held good of their
descendants [see Part I. pages 103-104].</p><p>
During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the
hard-and-fast line that once separated the native Irish from
the Anglo-Norman colony had gradually broken down.
The Norman lords wore the Irish dress, used the Irish
language, put out their children to foster with Irish nurses,
and adopted all the lawless and picturesque traditions
of their native land, becoming, as was said, "lHibernicis
Hiberniores," more Irish than the Irish themselves. In
Ulster and Connaught, the Normans had so thoroughly
fallen in with Irish ways, that they dropped their ancient
family names for names of the Irish fashion. In Leinster
and Munster some difference was still kept up, and here
the chief Norman houses bore sway.     The greatest
Norman house, that of the Geraldines or Fitzeralds, was
divided into two branches. The elder stock was most
powerful in the Pale and in Leinster, and its head bore the
title of Earl of Kildare. The younger branch was planted
in South Munster or Desmond, and had at its head the Earls
of Desmond. These two divisions of the Fitzgerald family
were separated from each other by the lands of the rival
Norman house of the Butlers, Earls of Ormonde, or East
Munster. They still held the best of the plain country,
while the Irish septs lurked in the hills, whence they perpetually
ravaged the farms of the lowlands. Among these
septs the O'Tooles and the O'Byrnes, who lived in the
Wicklow hills, commanded the country to within a few
miles of Dublin. In Ulster, Norman influence was as good
as forgotten, and great clan chieftains ruled over the O'Nleills
of middle and eastern Ulster, and the O'Donnells of the
wild west or Donegal, the two fiercest, strongest, most
warlike, and most thoroughly Celtic of all the Irish septs.
In Connaught, degenerate Normans, like the Buzrkes (De
Burghs) of Clanricarde, shared with Irish tribes, like the
O'Connors, the sovereignty of the poorest part of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.
The various feudal houses and native tribes were constantly



<pb id="p.140" n="140"/>      <note place="foot" n="10"> [<date value="1494">1494</date>--<date value="1541">1541</date>.] </note>
at war with each other.  The Irish law made murder
atonable by a money payment, and neither law nor tradition
did anything to bring about a better state of things.
It was no wonder that, when the two most disorderly forms
of government known thus struggled for mastery, disorder
should be chronic. The English king's dep ties, not
strong enough to set up firm rule, did something to make
matters worse by preventing any house or tribe that seemed
likely to overtop the others pushing to its fulness a power
that might have helped to stay the tide of anarchy.</p><p>
7. <persName key="Henry VII">Henry VII</persName>. was so weak at home that he left <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>
to itself, appointing the Earl of Kildare his Deputy in
<note place="foot" n="11"><placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> and Henry VI.</note>
Dublin, because he was the strongest of the
Irish nobles, and would be sure to rebel if he
did not have all his own way. "All <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>," he was once
told, "could not rule the Earl of Kildare." He answered,
"Then let the Earl of Kildare rule over all <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>," hoping
thus best to conceal his weakness. The system did not work.
Lambert Simnel and Perkin Warbeck both found a ready
welcome from the Irish, with the Earl of Kildare at their
head. To avoid further danger, Henry broke with Fitzgerald,
and sent an English soldier, Sir John Poynings, as
<note place="foot" n="12">The Parliamentof Drogheda andPoynings'

Deputy to <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>. In <date value="1494">1494</date>, Poynings held a
famous Parliament at Droh/eda, which passed
 an Act of Attainder against his predecessor
Kildare, and also the Act called Poynings'Law,
which forbad the Irish Parliament to pass any statute that
the English Council did not approve of, and so definitely
made <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> dependent on the English Government. It
was the first step towards the real conquest of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> by the
Tudors; but for the moment it bore little fruit The former
Deputy, Gerald Fitzgerald, eighth Earl of Kildare, was
pardoned in <date value="1496">1496</date> and restored as Deputy, the old system
proving the cheaper and easier.</p><p>
8. In the first part of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s reign no fresh
steps were taken to secure the English supremacy. When
<note place="foot" n="13"><persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. and <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName></note>
Kildare died in <date value="1513">1513</date>, his son, Gerald
Fitzgerald, the ninth earl, succeeded to the Deputyship
 almost as a matter of course, and, with a few
short breaks, remained Deputy for the next twenty years,
though he unscrupulously used his authority to avenge
himself on his private enemies, and aimed at building
up the Fitzgerald influence without any care for the
general welfare of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>. Twice Henry superseded him,
but the king's first experiment of sending the Earl of



  <pb id="p.141" n="141"/>
Surrey (afterwards Duke of Norfolk) as Deputy broke
down, because it was too costly to rule <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> after
the English fashion, and his second attempt at setting
up Anne Boleyn's kinsman, the head of the Butlers,
against him failed, because the Butlers were no match
for the Fitzgeralds, who surrounded them on both sides,
cut them off from access to Dublin, and turned the whole
Pale against them.  At last, in <date value="1534">1534</date>, the cup of Kildare's
iniquities was filled, and he was angrily summoned
to England and thrown into the Tower, where an
early death saved him from Henry's vengeance. But
he had left his son Thomas as his substitute in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>,
and, as soon as the news of the father's
<note place="foot" n="14">The Geraldine Revolt of <dateRange from="1534" to="1535">1534-5</dateRange>.</note>
imprisonment was known, the son raised all
the Geraldines in revolt against the king.
This young Fitzgerald, called Silken Thomas, from the silk
fringes which his followers wore on their helmets, was a
"headlong Hotspur" of the utmost recklessness and daring,
but he failed hopelessly in winning over Dublin to his side,
and all his energy was required to ward off the attacks of
the Butlers, who upheld the royal cause. In
<date value="1535">1535</date> Henry
VIII. sent Sir William Skeffington with a force of English
troops, who, after a five days siege, took by storm the
great Geraldine castle of M-taynooth, and forced the rebel
leader to surrender under vague promises of mercy. His
five uncles were treacherously arrested, though some of them
were quite guiltless. In <date value="1537">1537</date>
all six were hanged at Tyburn.
The Kildare country was ruthlessly devastated, and the
Kildare family only saved from extinction by the escape of
the boy Earl Gerald to<placeName key="France">France</placeName>.</p><p>
The easy suppression of the Geraldine revolt showed
that Henry, if he chose to exercise his power, was stronger
than any noble house in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.   In <date value="1536">1536</date> the aged
Skeffington died, and was succeeded by Lord Leonard
Grey, brother of the Marquis of Dorset, who, having
married a Fitzgerald, was likely to deal gently with the
cowed clan. The rule of Grey and his
<note place="foot" n="15">The RoyalSupremacy,theconciliation ofthe native chieftains and therecognition ofHenry as Kingof <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.</note>
successor, Sir Anthony St. Leger, was marked
by another great advance of English influence
.  The Irish Parliament abolished the
papal power, recognised Henry as head of
the Irish Church, and suppressed the monasteries
. Neither Norman nor Irish lords raised
any resistance, gladly accepting the monastery lands as their
share of the spoils, and being further conciliated by a lavish



<pb id="p.142" n="142"/>        <note place="foot" n="16"> [<date value="1541">1541</date>--<date value="1562">1562</date>.]</note>
creation of new titles.  For Henry gave earldoms and
baronies to many of the great clan chieftains, the head
of the O'Neills becoming Earl of Tyrone, the chief of
the O'Briens of Thomond becoming Earl of Thomond
[north Munster], and the descendant of the Burghs Earl of
Clanricarde. In I54I a Parliament was held, which the
new peers attended, and in which they gladly recognised
their benefactor Henry as King of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>. Former English
kings had only styled themselves Lords of "<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.</p><p>
<persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. meant to try to rule <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> effectively
by conciliating the Irish lords, both Norman and native;
while he sought to induce them to accept English law and
English ways along with their new titles. The experiment
soon proved an almost utter failure. Henry could only
rule <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> by force, and he was not able or willing to pay
the cost of an Irish army. The new earls and barons used
the spoils of the monasteries to strengthen themselves
against the king and each other, and the old feuds broke
out again with all their old rancour. Lord Leonard Grey
leant to his wife's kindred and played the game of the
Fitzgeralds as openly as the Earls of Kildare had done, till
he was recalled to England and beheaded by his implacable
master in I54I. His successor, St. Leger, limited his
efforts to reducing the septs that bordered on the Pale.
His abandonment of the distant parts of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> was a
practical confession that Henry had grasped at more than
he could hold.</p><p>
9. Under <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>. efforts were made to extend Protestantism
to <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> as well as England, but they met
with little success. There were no Protestants in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>,
even among the chieftains who had renounced the Pope
in order to get monastic lands.   In remote districts
<note place="foot" n="17"><placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> and <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName></note>.
popular piety had even prevented the suppression
of the monasteries, and the Franciscan
friars continued the chief religious teachers of the
native Irish, finding a better response from their unruly
flocks now that Protestantism began to be identified with
English influence.  The Protestant teachers sent over
from  England were not of the best sort.  The most
conspicuous among them was the learned scholar and hot
controversialist, John Bale, who, being made Bishop of
Ossory, strove to instruct his diocese by having his own
<note place="foot" n="18">The Reformation.</note>
plays, written to teach Protestantism, acted
at the market-cross at Kilkenny on Sunday
afternoons. Yet even Bale was only sent to <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> because



 <pb id="p.143" n="143"/>
he was too foul-tongued and intemperate to win preferment
in England. Under Mary the Pope and the Mass
were restored, but the queen's deputy, Thomas
<note place="foot" n="19"><placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> and Mary.</note>
Radclizfe, afterwards Earl of Sussex, went to
war vigorously against the Irish septs, and his victories increased
the racial hatred of English and Irish at the moment
when religious causes of difference were, for the last time,
absent. Sussex conquered the districts and Leix of Offaly,
and made them shire-ground; the advance of English law
being marked in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> as in <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> by the growth of new
counties or by the revival of old ones. Sussex called his
two new shires Queen's County and King's
<note place="foot" n="20">King's and Queen's Counties.</note>
County, after Mary and her husband Philip,
with the new fortresses of Maryborough and Philipstown
as their capitals. Such Irish, as were still allowed to live
there, were compelled to dress and order their lives after the
English fashion.  Many, however, were driven out and
replaced by English settlers.  This was a further step
forward in the conquest of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, and one which, in
subsequent generations, was to prove most important.
The English colonists brought in a higher civilisation
and a greater energy, but they treated the Irish as savages
possessing no rights, and butchered and cheated them
without scruple. The Irish retaliated to the utmost of their
power, and the establishment of Mary's colonists in Leinster
was but the beginning of a savage war of races, which
made more difficult the future solution of the Irish problem.</p><p>
10. Sussex remained Deputy of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> after <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s
succession, and the religious changes which had been
carried out in England were duly extended to <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>
by the local Parliament. The queen had her hands so
full at home that she was anxious to keep <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> at peace,
and fell back on her father's policy of ruling
<note place="foot" n="21"><persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> and Shane O'Neil <dateRange from="1558" to="1567">1558-1567</dateRange>.</note>
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> through her friendship with the local
chieftains. The course of events in Ulster
'made it very difficult to pursue this line of conduct. Con
O'Neill, first Earl of Tyrone, had procured from Henry VI II.
the reversion of the title and the barony of Dungannon for his
illegitimate son Matthew, whose mother was a smith's wife
at Dundalk. The earl was now growing old and his eldest
legitimate son, Shane [John] O'Neill, indignant at the preference
shown to his half-brother, waged war against his
father and the baron of Dungannon, and finally murdered
the latter and drove the former to take refuge within the
English Pale, where he died. Shane now procured his





<pb id="p.144" n="144"/>      <note place="foot" n="22"> [<date value="1562">1562</date>--<date value="1567">1567</date>.] </note>
election as The O'Neill, or chief of the clan, and set to
work to establish his power on a firm basis in Ulster.
Sussex did his best to make head against him, and planted
a garrison on the Cathedral Hill of Armagh, which was
a perpetual thorn in his side. But he had neither men
nor money sufficient to conquer Shane, and even failed in a
plot which he had formed for his assassination. It was a
great triumph for Shane when he went, in <date value="1562">1562</date>, to London
to plead his cause before <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> in person. The handsome chief and his following of gallowglasses, with their long
curls, bare heads, wide-sleeved saffron shirts, shaggy coats
of frieze and broad axes, created a great sensation in
London.  Brought before <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, Shane fell on his
knees, and "confessed his rebellion with howling." "For
lack of education and civility," he declared in Irish, " I have
offended." He won the queen's graces by asking to be
allowed to attend on the Lord Robert Dudley, "that I may
learn to ride after the English fashion, and run at the tilt,
to hawk, to shoot, and use such other good exercises as
I perceive my said good lord to be meet unto." Yet at
the very moment when Shane was learning "civility"
under <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s suitor, his emissaries were clearing the
way for him in Ulster by murdering his nephew, the young
Baron of Dungannon, his brother Matthew's son. Despite
this, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> sent Shane home with many marks of
favour. During the next few years he made himself absolute
master of Ulster. He put down his rival among his own
clan, he defeated the hostile septs of the O'Donnells, the
Maguires, and the O'Rileys, and utterly defeated the Scots
of the Macdonnell clan, who had recently settled in Clandeboye or Antrim.
In <date value="1566">1566</date> Sussex was replaced by Sir
Henry Sidney, who tried in vain to reduce Shane's power.
"Lucifer," he wrote, "was never so puffed up with pride
and ambition as O'Neill." Shane gloried in his rebellion,
declaring that, " If it were to do again, I could do it, for my
ancestors were kings of Ulster and Ulster was theirs, and
Ulster is mine and shall be mine." " He continually," wrote
Sidney, "keepeth six hundred armed men, as it were his
janissaries, about him. He is able to bring five thousand
soldiers to the field: he is the only strong man in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.
His country was never so rich or so inhabited. He armeth
all the peasants, the first Irishman who ever did so." He
intrigued with the Scots, the French, the King of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>,
and the Pope. Never had Irish chieftain been so powerful
for many a generation.</p><p>



  <pb id="p.145" n="145"/>
Feeling that Shane's power must be extirpated at any
cost, Sidney in <date value="1567">1567</date> proclaimed him a rebel, and invaded
Ulster.  On the approach of the Deputy's army, the
O'Donnells and other conquered clans threw off Shane's
yoke, and joined heartily with the English. Shane dared
not risk a battle, and was soon so hard-pressed that

<figure id="Fig.014" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.012.DO01.00014"><head>Ireland</head></figure>


he fled for refuge to his old enemies, the Macdonnells of
Antrim, who hacked him to pieces, and threw his body
into a pit. Shane was the ablest of Irish clan chieftains,
and his failure showed how impossible it was for the lord
ot a sept to make himself supreme beyond the tribal




<pb id="p.146" n="146"/>     <note place="foot" n="23"> [<date value="1573">1573</date>--<date value="1579">1579</date>.] </note>
limits. He was no national Irish hero, and outside his
clan, all men rejoiced at his fall. He was a man of
the worst character, cruel, tyrannical, licentious, gluttonous,
and drunken. He spoke no tongue but Irish, and could
not write his own name. Yet he was one of the greatest
soldiers and diplomatists of his time, and for nearly ten
years set <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> at defiance.</p><p>
11. Ulster remained quiet for some years after Shane's
fall; nominally it was made shire-ground, and in <date value="1573">1573</date>, an
attempt was made to extend to it the policy of
<note place="foot" n="24">Walter Earl of<placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>, fails to colonise Clandeboye <date value="1573">1573</date>- <date value="1576">1576</date>.</note>
colonisation, already attempted in Mary's
time further south. JWalterDevereux, Earlof
<placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>, the father of the favourite of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s
old age, and a brave soldier and earnest Protestant,
volunteered to colonise Ulster, and bring it under
English control. The queen made over to him Clandeboye
or Antrim, and agreed to share with him the cost of
raising troops and building forts.  But his rashness and
want of foresight soon made his position intolerable. He
embroiled himself both with the O'Neills and the Scottish
MacDonnells, and did not scruple to employ hideous
treachery and ruthless slaughter, to encompass his ends.
The murder of MacPhelim O'Neill at a banquet, to which
he had been invited by <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>, and the massacre of
the Scots in Rathlin island, turned all parties against him.
He quarrelled with Fitzwilliam  the Deputy, who gave
him no help.   His English followers found that there
was no prospect of peaceful settlement or of comfortable
livelihood, and went home in disgust, or died of famine,
disease, or in battle. At last <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> gave up in despair,
and died in <date value="1576">1576</date>. His attempt at colonisation had proved
an utter failure.</p><p>
12. Sir Henry Sidney was reappointed governor in <date value="1575">1575</date>,
and held office till <date value="1578">1578</date>. He had long been President of the
<note place="foot" n="25">Sir Henry Sidney's government, <dateRange from="1575" to="1578">1575-1578</dateRange>.</note>
Council of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>, and turned his Welsh experience
to good account in his more difficult
Irish charge. He was the strongest of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s
Deputies, showed extraordinary activity, and was full
of plans for the extension of the royal authority  His
constant journeys to the remotest parts of Connaught and
Munster made the Dublin government something more of
a reality than it had been, and his institution of provincial
governments under presidents in those provinces made the
pressure of the central authority better felt. He was influential with the queen, having married Leicester's sister,



 	   <pb id="p.147" n="147"/>
the Lady Mary Dudley, and their young son, Philip Sidney,
was already looked up to as the most brilliant and attractive
of the young gentlemen that surrounded <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. But
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> disliked Sir Henry's activity, because it was too
expensive, and in <date value="1578">1578</date>,
he cheerfully went back to Ludlow
to resume the more grateful task of the government of
<placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>. With his departure new troubles soon began to
afflict <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.</p><p>
13. Up to this time, <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> had been a world by itself,
and the struggle of tribe against tribe, or of the native
Celts against the English government, had
<note place="foot" n="26"><placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> and the Counter-Reformation.</note>
had little relation to the general current of
European movements. The constant trouble
that <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> gave to <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, now tempted the queen's
enemies to back up the Irish resistance, and use the
Norman lords and Celtic septs, as instruments of the
Counter-Reformation, and of Spanish aggression.  Pope
Gregory XIII., seeing the failure of the attack on England,
prepared an expedition to invade <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, and, despite a
first failure, sent in
<date value="1579">1579</date> to Kerry James Fitzmaurice, a
member of the Desmond branch of the Geraldines, who
had been driven into exile for earlier rebellions.
<note place="foot" n="27">Fitzmaurice and Sanders, <date value="1579">1579</date>.</note>
 Fitzmaurice landed in Kerry with a
small force of Spanish and Italian troops, despatched without
Philip's nominal sanction, and accompanied by a refugee
English priest, Dr. Aicholas Sanders, famous as a controversalist,
who had been appointed papal nuncio to <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.
Fitzmaurice soon perished obscurely, but the smooth
tongue of Sanders persuaded his great kinsman, Gerald
Fiitzerald, iftioenlh Earl of Desmond, to rise in revolt
against <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. All Munster thus fell away, and the
new Deputy, Lord Grey de Wilton, who now came to
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, with the poet Edmund Spenser as his secretary,
had hard work to deal with the rebellion.
<note place="foot" n="28">The DesmondRebellion,<date value="1579">1579
</date>-<date value="1583">1583</date>-</note>
But as the O'Donnells had helped Sidney
against the O'Neills, so now the Butlers
helped Grey against the Fitzgeralds, and <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>,
thoroughly alarmed at the prospect of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> going over
to <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> or the Pope, made greater efforts than she had
been wont to do in putting down Irish disaffection. Among
the young Englishmen that now went over to <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>,
eager for booty and adventure, was Walter Raleigh, the
captain of a company of one hundred soldiers.</p><p>
The Geraldines were unable to hold the field against a
regular force, and the rebellion was gradually stamped out



<pb id="p.148" n="148"/>      <note place="foot" n="29">  [<date value="1580">1580</date>--<date value="1598">1598</date>.] </note>
in detail, with cold-blooded cruelty. The Spanish garrison,
which had gallantly defended itself at Smerzwick, was forced
to surrender in I58o, and was put to the sword without
scruple, having no better right to be there than the English
seamen on the Spanish Main. Desmond and Sanders took
to the hills, where Sanders perished miserably of disease or
starvation, while Desmond was betrayed to the Butlers and
stabbed in his bed. The ill-paid soldiers of the queen took
out their wages by plundering and maltreating the Irish.
All Munster was made a desert, and thousands of homeless
peasants perished of the famine and pestilence that came in
the train of war. The wretched survivors lived on dead
carrion, and the herbs of the fields.</p><p>
14. More than half a million acres in Munster were now
adjudged forfeited to the crown, and redivided into shires.
<note place="foot" n="30">The Plantation	of Munster, <date value="1584">1584</date>.</note>
A systematic attempt was made to replace the Irish
inhabitants by English settlers; and Sir
John Perrot, formerly President of Munster, was made
Deputy in I 584, to superintend the carrying out of the plantation.
The forfeited estates were granted out in great plots to
English gentlemen undertaker6, who were to reserve some of
the land as their own demesne, and parcel out the rest among
English farmers. But the Plantation of 4unster was never
fully carried out, and so far as it was attempted it soon
broke down. The undertakers were either adventurers,
eager to make money, or English officials who took little
trouble about their cheaply won Irish estates. English
farmers of the right sort were not forthcoming in sufficient
numbers, and those who came found that the undertakers
exacted such extortionate rents, that they could hardly
make a living, though exposed to ceaseless dangers and
hardships. Before long they were crowded out by the Irish
who, anxious to get back to their old haunts, offered much
higher rents, and were actually preferred as tenants by the
greedy adventurers. A few poor English gentlemen strove
to make their home in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, as, for example, Spenser the
poet, who settled down at Kilcolman, a ruined castle of the
Desmonds, where he collected the materials for his
famous View of the State of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, which gives such a
powerful picture of the unhappy condition of the <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>
of his days, and urges strongly an English conquest more
systematic and thoroughgoing than <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s economy
would ever allow. Much suffering would have been spared
to <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, had Spenser's stern but wise advice been
followed. Subsequent rebellion made short work of the



  	  <pb id="p.149" n="149"/>
scattered English settlers, and almost the only permanent
result of the Plantation of Munster was the establishment
of a large number of English landlords in the estates once
ruled by the Geraldines.</p><p>
15. Despite the Munster Plantation, <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> was as unsettled
as ever, though something was done to promote
the spread of Protestantism, and the establishment of
Dublin University in <date value="1591">1591</date>
was evidence that the queen's
government was not altogether unmindful of scholarship
and learning. Yet such a measure did not touch the native
Irish, while the steady and oppressive development of
the English power, and the growing enthusiasm of the
Irish for the Catholic cause, were beginning to weld
together the divided septs and races of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> into something
resembling a nation. In the last years of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s
reign, a third series of Irish revolts broke out with more
fury than ever. The beginning of them was in Ulster,where,
some years after Shane O'Neill's death, his nephew, Hugh
O'Neill, younger brother of the Baron of Dungannon
murdered in <date value="1562">1562</date>,
was, after being educated in England,
sent home to build up an English party among the O'Neill
clan. For many years Hugh struggled against
<note place="foot" n="31">HughO'Neill,Earl of Tyrone.</note>
Tirlogh Lenogh, chosen The O'Neill after
Shane's death, and, failing to get the better of his rival, was
so friendly to the government, that he fought against
Desmond in Ulster, and was rewarded by the revival of the
earldom of Tyrone in his favour. However after Tirlogh
Lenogh's death, Hugh was chosen The O'Neill by the tribe,
and soon forgot his English "civility" and put himself at
the head of the Irish Celtic party. He was less able, but
more far-seeing and cautious, than his uncle Shane. He
did not aspire to conquer the rival septs of Ulster, but
rather to induce them to follow him against the common
enemy. Besides thus building up an Ulster party, he
professed himself a staunch Catholic, and soon received
promises of help from Philip II.</p><p>
Tyrone's relations with the English now became very
threatening. More than once he was at open war with the
Deputy, but peace was somehow patched up,
<note place="foot" n="32"> The Revolt ofo'Neill, <date value="1598">1598</date>.</note>
and at last, in June <date value="1598">1598</date>, he received a pardon
in return for a submission on terms that would have almost
destroyed his power.  He took advantage of the lull to
attack a fort on the Blackwater, and in August cut to pieces
the army sent to its relief, under Sir Henry Bagenal, at the
battle of the Yellow Ford. This unexpected victory spread



<pb id="p.150" n="150"/>        <note place="foot" n="33">[<date value="1598">1598</date>--<date value="1607">1607</date>.] </note>
consternation in Dublin, and delight over all native <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.
Tyrone now appeared, not simply, like Shane, the would-be
conqueror of Ulster, but the representative of the Irish
race and of Catholicism, against the foreign and heretic
conqueror; but he himself was the last to realise his great
position. After a time, however, he sent a force to Munster,
and "the very day it set foot within the province, Munster
to a man was in arms before noon." James Fitzgerald,
<note place="foot" n="34">The Munster Revolt under the Suan Earl of Desmond, <date value="1598">1598</date>.</note>
nephew of the last Earl of Desmond, put himself
at the head of the rebels, and assumed
the title of Earl of Desmond, though the
 queen's friends called him in scorn the Sugan
or "'straw-rope" earl.  Amidst dire atrocities the few
remaining relics of the Munster Plantation were destroyed.
The planters had not force or courage even to resist, and,
as many as could fled in a panic to the towns. Among
them was Edmund Spenser, who, luckier than many of his
fellows, escaped with his life, though one of his children
perished in the flames of his burning house at Kilcolman.
"In the course of seventeen days," boasted the Irish
annalists, "the Irish left not within the length and breadth
of the country of the Geraldines a single son of a Saxon,
whom they did not kill or expel."  It was the first act in
the long war of races and religions, that makes up so much
of the modern history of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.</p><p>
In abject fear lest the Spaniards should combine with the
rebels, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> sent, in <date value="1599">1599</date>, her former favourite Robert
Deverezix, <persName key="Earl of Essex">Earl of <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName></persName>, with whom she had just been
reconciled, to put down the Irish revolt.  He was given
extraordinary powers as lord-lieutenant, and was promised
an army of nearly twenty thousand men. But he mismanaged
matters very badly, and his troops, who showed
 rank cowardice under his unsteady direction,
<note place="foot" n="35">Robert Earl of<placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>'s failure,<date value="1599">1599</date>.</note>
melted rapidly away. After utterly failing in
Munster, <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> rashly went against Tyrone
with less than three thousand men, and was compelled to
accept a humiliating truce. Without leave to quit his post,
he hurried back to England, where he soon met his
fate.</p><p>
In  <date value="1600">1600</date> Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, succeeded
Mountjoy ends <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>. He was a strong, shrewd,
the Rebellion,  unscrupulous man, whose private life was
<dateRange from="1600" to="1603">1600-1603</dateRange>.  notorious from an intrigue with <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>'s sister,
Penelope Rich, whom he afterwards married.  Mountjoy
was a good soldier, and, after three years of hard struggle,



    <pb id="p.151" n="151"/>
he completed successfully the work in which his predecessor
had so signally failed.  He began his task in
Munster and soon pressed the rebels hard. In I6oI four
thousand Spaniards came to their assistance, but were
soon besieged by him in Kinsale. O'Neill marched to the
relief of Kinsale with a strong force drawn from all parts
of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, but, on 24th December, Mountjoy won a decisive
victory over him. Soon after the Spaniards surrendered,
and open war in Munster was at an end. The
Sugan Earl was captured in <date value="1601">1601</date>,
hiding in a cave, and,
with unwonted mercy, sent to the Tower of London, where
he remained a prisoner until his death. Mountjoy planted
forts and garrisons in Munster, which effectively suppressed
the embers of the revolt and kept the people down for the
future. He then turned against Hugh O'Neill, who still
held most of Ulster against the queen, though his former
associates Hugh O'Donnell now fled to <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> and Hugh's
brother Rory submitted to Mountjoy, and was made Earl
of Tyrconnel. The combat was thus narrowed to a
struggle between Mountjoy and the O'Neills. Tyrone soon
found that he could not match the disciplined troops of
the deputy, and on 3rd April <date value="1603">1603</date>
he gave in and made
terms, abjuring the title of The O'Neill and all foreign
alliances. News had not yet reached <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>that <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
had died on March 24th. Thus the Irish revolt ended
with the queen's life.<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> was at last conquered, but
the cruelty of the long process, the result largely of the
queen's overthriftiness and hesitation, left ineffaceable
memories behind. Law and order were secured, but they
were dearly purchased at the price paid for them.</p><p>
16. Mountjoy had facilitated the conquest by the easy
terms he had granted to some at least of the vanquished
chieftains. His successor, Sir Arthir Chichester,
<note place="foot" n="36">Rule ofChichester, <date value="1604">1604</date>-<date value="1614">1614</date>.</note>
 who ruled <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> from<dateRange from="1604" to="1614">
1604 to 1614</dateRange>,
had no policy for keeping <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> permanently
at peace save by wholly destroying the Irish or
making them Englishmen by main force. He forced the
dependents of the great chieftains to hold their lands
directly of the crown, strove to create a class of small
freeholders, and attempted to enforce recusancy fines for
non-attendance at church, after the English fashion. The
pardoned Tyrone bitterly resented these attacks on his
tribal independence, and in <date value="1607">1607</date> fled from <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> for ever,
fearing a plot against him. With him went Rory O'Donnell
the new-made Earl of Tyrconnel. Chichester and the king



<pb id="p.152" n="152"/>     	  <note place="foot" n="37">[<date value="1614">1614</date>.</note>
refused to recognise the Irish law and custom, by which
the land belonged not to the chief but to the clan, and,
though they had been previously trying to get the tribesmen
on their side against the chief, they profited by the
flight of the chieftains to upset the whole tribal system. The
withdrawal of the two earls was deemed evidence of their
guilt. The land over which they had ruled in the patriarchal
fashion, including a great part of Ulster, was treated
as private property and confiscated for their treason. In
these districts Chichester (not deterred by <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>'s failure in
Antrim and Perrot's in Munster) successfully carried out
the policy of colonisation recommended by Bacon.</p><p>
The forfeited country was divided between English and
Scottish colonists, a few estates being granted as a favour
to such of the native Irish as had remained
<note place="foot" n="38">The Plantation of Ulster, <date value="1610">1610</date>.
</note> loyal. The dispossessednatives were driven
from their homes to the barren west; and theplantation was
so energetically carried through, that north-eastern <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>,
the rudest region and the one most hostile to <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>,
became a new Protestant and Puritan <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, peopled by
peaceable English farmers and tradesmen, who turned the
wilderness into good farming country, and made it prosperous,
but who kept down with stern severity and
treated as their inferiors the native Irish, who still lingered
as cotters among them.  The Ulster plantation brought
with it new difficulties, but it ended many of the old ones,
and made permanent the English conquest of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>,
by establishing in it a strong and vigorous colony, whose
interests and very lives depended upon the keeping up of
the English and Protestant connection.  Before their
influence the old tribal<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> slowly melted away. But
the Irish remained, and with the disappearance of their old
anarchic institutions, the old tribal hatreds that had kept
them asunder began to die away also. United by its new-found
zeal for Catholicism, no less than by the oppression
that bound its tribes down in a common servitude, Celtic
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> sullenly bided its time for revenge.</p>

England under the Tudors.</head><p>
1. Despite the practical despotism of the Tudor kings,
the framework of the medieval constitution continued



        <pb id="p.153" n="153"/>
unchanged, and <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. and <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s policy of
ruling through the House of Commons even increased the
dignity of Parliament. An Elizabethan writer
<note place="foot" n="1">The Constitutionunder the	Tudors</note>
wrote thus of the High Court of Parliament :
"This house hath the most high and absolute 				.
power of the realm, for thereby mighty princes have been
deposed, laws enacted and abrogated, offenders of all sorts
punished, and corrupted religion disannulled or reformed.
What the people of Rome did in their Comitia the same
may be done by the authority of the Parliament house,
wherein every particular person is intended to be present,
if not by himself, by attorney."</p><p>
The constitution of both Houses of Parliament underwent
important changes during the century. The whole
character of the House of Lords was altered.
<note place="foot" n="2">The House ofLords.</note>
The removal of the mitred abbots gave the
lay peers a majority for the first time.  The change in
the character of the episcopate made the successors of
the prelates, who had led the opposition in mediaeval Parliaments,
the obedient and submissive creatures of the Crown.
The secular nobles remained so small a body that the
episcopal vote was still important. The largest number of
lay peers that sat in any of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s parliaments was
fifty-one. Very few of the mediaeval families still remained.
Houses like those of Stafford and Howard, which, under
<persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>., were looked upon as typical representatives
of the ancient aristocracy, won their importance only at the
very end of the Middle Ages. They were soon outnumbered
by the new peerage, which sprang up in the service of
<persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>., and was endowed with the spoils of the
monasteries. The new nobles, such as the Russells, Earls of
Bedford after i5 5o,and the Cavendishes, Earls of Devonshire
after <date value="1618">1618</date>, were an official nobility dependent on the Crown
and supporting the Crown, both from loyalty and policy. Bit
by bit the remaining ancient houses were forced to accept
the same position or were destroyed. After the great house
of Stafford had been broken by Wolsey's triumph over Buckingham,
the Howards gave up the struggle and won a new
importance in the service of the Crown. Two Dukes of
Norfolk were Treasurers all through the reign of Henry
VIII., and the speedy catastrophe which overwhelmed the
poet Earl of Surrey, and his son, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s Duke of
Norfolk, showed them how hopeless it was to aspire to
the independent attitude of a mediaval baron. The old
tradition died hardest in the north, but the proscriptions







<pb id="p.154" n="154"/>
which followed the Pilgrimage of Grace and the Revolt of the
Northern Earls in <date value="1569">1569</date> destroyed the last remnants of the
power of that historical nobility beyond the Humber, which
from the days of Magna Carta to the Wars of the Roses,
had been so tenacious of its local position and so inveterate
in its opposition to the Crown. <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> created peers so
sparingly that the numbers of the House of Lords slightly
declined during her reign. Before her death, the stronger
houses of the new creation were beginning to take up a
more independent position. The smallness of the numbers
of the peers did something to augment their individual
dignity and importance.</p><p>
  The House of Commons largely increased in numbers.
Under <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>., members came for the first time from
 <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>, Cheshire, Berwick, and Calais. New
<note place="foot" n="3">The House ofCommons.</note>
boroughs were freely created all through the
century, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> adding some sixty new members from
this source. We have already seen how, despite these
additions, and despite increased skill in the art of managing
Parliaments and elections, the House of Commons
took up an increasingly independent tone. Nevertheless,
there were as yet few occasions of conflict between Crown
and Parliament. It was universally agreed that the provinces
of the two were different. Neither <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> nor
Henry wished to prevent Parliament having its due share
in legislation and taxation, nor did either monarch seriously
attempt to interfere with its right of criticism and remonstrance.
The Tudor Parliaments never aspired to
control the executive.  The ordinary government of the
country they left entirely in the hands of the Crown.
</p><p>  2. The strengthening of the executive power is a marked
feature of Tudor times. The chief mission of the Crown
<note place="foot" n="4">Growth of the executivepower. </note>
was to secure peace and order, and to put
 down the overpowerful subjects who in the
days of York and <placeName key="Lancaster">Lancaster</placeName> had done only what was right
in their own eyes. Before the end of the century, turbulent
The central  and lawless England had become peaceful
Government.  and law-abiding. Even in the remotest parts
of the country the authority of the Crown was now universally
respected.</p><p>
  As the work of government became more elaborate, even
princes like Henry and <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> were forced to entrust to
<note place="foot" n="5">The Secretaries and the Council. </note>
others a large part of their power. The Tudor
ministers were in all cases chosen freely by
the Crown, and ruthlessly removed if they ceased to carry






                        <pb id="p.155" n="155"/>

out the royal policy. Many of the more dignified of the
ancient offices of state, such as the positions of Treasurer,
or Chancellor, or Admiral, went by prescriptive right to
great noblemen, who could not devote all their energy to
the king's service, and who were not always clever enough
to wield any wide influence. The tendency now was for
these high officials to limit themselves closely to their own
departments, leaving the general superintendence of the
whole executive government, and the large discretionary
powers which this involved to fall more and more into the
hands of the two principal secretaries, first called during
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s time Secretaries of State, whose political importance
dates from the Tudor period. The haphazard and
spasmodic control of medieval times became inadequate.
The Crown now aspired to regulate all the ordinary affairs
of life. A permanent foreign policy had to be kept up.
Constant watchfulness was necessary to enforce the laws,
and the volume of legislation was enormously increased.
The Secretary, as a rule a man of humbler social rank
than the great officers, but of stronger ability and of
more complete devotion to his political work, became the
assistant, the eye and hand, of the king his master. Nothing
was too great and nothing was too small to escape
his notice. From the activity of the Tudor Secretaries
grew up all the elaborate departments of state of later
times.</p><p>
  The wide Concilium Ordinarium of earlier times was
now practically extinct, and the smaller and more confidential
Council, often now called the Privy Council, was
the chief consultative body and mouthpiece of the executive
power. So strong was its influence that the
<note place="foot" n="6">The Privy Council and its offshoots.</note>
Tudor period has not been inaptly described
as the period of government by Council. The
number of councillors was small, including as a rule about
seventeen or eighteen persons, who took a special oath, and
who in most cases held official positions under the crown.
It was characteristic of Tudor policy that this body included
as a rule statesmen of very different ways of thinking, as for
example the men of the old and the new learning during the
reign of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.; and the tendency of the sovereign to
listen sometimes to one party and sometimes to another
produced fluctuations of policy which suggest a sort of
rudimentary form of party government. It is, however, a
mistake to exaggerate the amount of influence of the
Council on the Crown. The Council was always the king's





<pb id="p.156" n="156"/>

council: the Crown acted and the councillors only advised,
and very often the Crown refused to follow their lead. Yet
as the councillors had to carry out the royal will, their
influence in fashioning details must have been considerable,
and neither Henry nor <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> was disposed to limit
their independence so long as they knewtheir place. Besides
its administrative work, the Council issued ordinances or
proclamations, which tended more and more to usurp the
place of Acts of Parliament, so as to encroach upon the
legislative power. It also exercised very important judicial
functions, being in this respect the chief instrument by which
the authority of the Crown was maintained and the reign
of law upheld. Its jurisdiction was partly appellate and
partly original. The latter is of the greatest importance,
and especially its criminal jurisdiction, which, gradually
growing up during the fifteenth century, assumed a new
importance under the Tudors. In <date value="1487">1487</date> a special Act of
Parliament had set up a new court called the Star Chamber
[see part i, pages 359-360], most of whose members were
privy councillors, to deal with great offenders.  By the
<note place="foot" n="7">The Star Chamber. </note>
accession of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> the constitution and
powers of the Star Chamber had considerably
changed. It now consisted of all the privy councillors and
the chief justices as well. To it was gradually transferred
all the criminal business that had occupied the Council in
earlier times, as well as the special jurisdiction over great
offenders given to it by the Act of <date value="1487">1487</date>. Henceforth the
Star Chamber is little more than the Council sitting in its
judicial capacity. As long as <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> lived it was not
unpopular, though its legal basis was questionable. It was
looked on as the protector of order, as well as giving
individuals redress of their grievances in more equitable
and quick ways than the hide-bound traditions of the
common law allowed. The Star Chamber did for the
whole nation what the Council of the North [see page 40],
or the Council of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> [see page 134], did for particular
parts of it. It was not until Whitgift first used the court
to suppress religious opposition that it began to be criticised.
It was not until the Stewart period that the court called
into existence to put down baronial anarchy was hated as
being mainly directed towards depriving Englishmen of
their civil and religious liberties. Even before that time
the Court of High Commission [see page 78] had made
itself odious by its inquisitorial methods and harshness
in dealing with Puritans, though even that body did good






                 <pb id="p.157" n="157"/>

work in reducing the abuses from which the Elizabethan
Church suffered so much.</p><p>
  3. What the Council and the Star Chamber did for the
central administration, the Justices of the Peace did for the
local government. It is a striking proof of
<note place="foot" n="8"> Local government.</note>
the popular character of the Tudor sovereignty
that its local agents were not paid state officials, but the
gentry of the shires and the merchants and
<note place="foot" n="9"> The Justices or the Peace and Quarter Session.</note>
tradesmen of the towns, discharging
voluntarily and gratuitously the ever-increasing
functions entrusted to them by the Crown. The Justices of
the Peace not only exercised judicial functions over petty
offenders, but in their Quarter Sessions carried out the
whole of the administration of the shire, whose ancient
court, the shiremoot, was now practically obsolete, save
when it met for the purpose of returning knights of the
shire to Parliament.  Besides their original function of
suppressing riot and disorder, the justices in Tudor times
were entrusted with the carrying out of regulations affecting
industry and trade, and especially the Statute of
Apprentices of <date value="1563">1563</date>,
which empowered them to fix the rate
of wages and settle disputes between employers and their
workmen. They were also administrators of the Elizabethan
Poor Law; they hunted out vagrants, Popish Recusants,
and Non-conformists ; they administered the oath
of allegiance, and <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> prohibited the country clergy
from marrying without the advice and approval of two justices
of the peace. The constant schooling in every branch
of administration which the work of a justice involved gave
the gentry an excellent political and judicial training which
prepared them for their work in Parliament. If the first
result was to send them to Parliament with the habits of an
official, naturally prone to uphold the Crown, the habit of
obedience gradually passed away, while the training in
affairs and the cautious and balanced judgment still remained.
It is because the Tudors ruled through the
country gentry, that the sons and grandsons of the agents
of the royal autocracy were able to control and defeat the
government of the Stewarts.</p><p>
  4. Another Tudor institution was that of the Lords
Lieutenant. By acts of <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>. and Mary
<note place="foot" n="10">Lords Lieutenant.</note>
a Lord Lieutenant was appointed by the
Crown in every county to act as commander of the local
Militia, the only organised armed force that Tudor England
possessed. Deputy Lieutenants were appointed to assist





<pb id="p.158" n="158"/>

him. Everybody was still compelled to serve in the militia
or to provide a substitute, and a law of Mary, embodying the
<note place="foot" n="11">The Militia and military forces of the Crown.</note>
principle of the ancient Assize of Arms, fixed
 the amount ofarms, armour, horses, and equipment
 to be provided by all property holders
for the use of the national force, even the clergy being
compelled to contribute their share.  The little body
called the Yeomen of the Guard, to defend the royal person,
a few companies of paid soldiers to defend Calais and
Berwick, and a small but well-armed and highly paid force
of Spanish and Italian mercenaries that <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. had
established, were the only approaches to a standing army
in Tudor times. Most despots have ruled ultimately by
armed force. It was the special glory of the Tudors that
their only way of suppressing popular revolt on a large scale
was through the popular militia. It was considered a great
innovation when the rebellion of <date value="1549">1549</date> was suppressed by
<persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s foreign mercenaries, and no subsequent ruler
ventured to repeat the ill-fated experiment of the Council
of <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>.</p><p>
  5. Even the navy was levied and equipped on popular
principles. The subject was bound to defend the realm by
<note place="foot" n="12">The Navy,</note>
sea as well as by land, but while every ablebodied
man was thought fit without further
preparation to fight on land, the special training and
experience required for naval warfare limited the obligation
to serve at sea to the coast districts and the seaports;
and especially to the Cinque Ports and their Lord Warden.
Moreover, there was a permanent royal navy, built and
fitted out by the king out of his general revenue, and
manned, when necessary, by pressed men. The king's ships
set the example of improvements in naval architecture.
<persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. did a great work in setting up and equipping
the royal navy on modern methods. He brought many fine
ships from abroad and had others constructed at home. The
Great Harry, built by him in <date value="1515">1515</date>, marks an epoch in the
development of our maritime power, and he also established
the Navy Office and set apart certain officers to manage the
civil branches of the navy under the Lord High Admiral.
We have already seen how the retired corsair and smuggler,
Sir John Hawkins, built a new English navy that was easily
able to outmanceuvre and outsail the boasted galleons of
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, after that the poverty of the Crown under Mary and
Edward had reduced the royal navy so that it was not
strong enough to clear the Narrow Seas of pirates. Even





             <pb id="p.159" n="159"/>

under <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, on great occasions, like the resistance to
the Armada, armed merchant ships supplemented the royal
fleet. In those days of lawlessness at sea, every trader
was armed and used to fighting, and the line between
merchant and pirate was by no means closely drawn. The
increase of our merchant navy had much more to do with
the growth of our maritime greatness than that of the royal
navy.</p><p>
  6. With the growth of trade, merchants greatly flourished.
How important the trader had now become is shown in
the whole career of Sir Thomas Gresham
<note place="foot" n="13">  Growth of commerce and the commercial spirit</note>.
(d. <date value="1579">1579</date>), the princely merchant who acted as
financial agent for <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s three
children, and who was famous as the founder
of the Royal Exchange at London, and for setting aside
a large portion of his vast fortune to found in Gresham
College a popular teaching university in London, though
the scheme carried out fell far short of this. Yet lovers of
old ways complained that merchants had become a "clog
to the Commonwealth," keeping up prices with their monopolies
and combinations, and recking of little but their
private gain. There was a class of "bodgers," who bought
up corn, and exported it even in times of scarcity, and
thus artificially raised prices in England, or sold it to the
poor after it had become rotten and unwholesome. But
the commercial spirit had now affected all classes.  The
most heroic of the Elizabethan adventurers had as keen
an eye to the main chance as the modern speculator or
stock-jobber.  The highest families in the land were
infected with this spirit. The queen herself had shares
in desperate piratical adventures against <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. Nobles
became graziers and farmers, and sold their game and
venison. One noble lady did not scruple to ride herself
to market to see that her butter was well sold.  The
farmers were not content with what they could get at the
nearest market town, but would send their corn twenty
miles to market in the hope of getting a better price. But
this increased bustle and activity did good as well as harm.
Men found that they could only live by striking out new
lines for themselves.</p><p>
   Competition, and the fierce struggle for existence which
 it involved, was no longer lamented as an unmixed evil,
 but accepted as a stern necessity.  If the weakest inevitably
 went to the wall, the stronger and fiercer could
 make better conditions, and the state did something to





<pb id="p.160" n="160"/>

mitigate the wretchedness of those who are least able
to fend for themselves. The result was that the economic
<note place="foot" n="14">Completion ofthe Economic and Agrarian Revolution. </note>
miseries that in the beginning of the century
 had attended the break-up of the social
system, found partly, at least, their gradual
remedy. It is instructive to compare the sad
picture of the condition of England drawn in More's Utopia
in the early part of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s reign with the more
elaborate Description of England, which a Puritan parson,
William Harrison, compiled in the middle of the reign of
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. We see from the latter how material wealth and
prosperity were enormously increased. The enclosure of
commons, and the turning of arable land into pasture, ceased
when the demand for English wool fell off, partly because
with an increased output the quality deteriorated, and partly
because the manufacturing cities of the Netherlands, the
prey of war and persecution, no longer enjoyed their former
prosperity. Agriculture again flourished.  "The soil,"
wrote Harrison, "had grown to be more fruitful, and the
countrymen more peaceful, more careful, and more skilful
for recompense of gain." More attention was devoted to
manuring the crops, and manuals of agricultural practice
both in prose and verse, were widely circulated. Corngrowing
again became profitable, and the cultivation of
hops, newly brought in from the Netherlands, took so firm
a root that many Kentish orchards were destroyed to make
way for the new crop. A greater variety of fruits, vegetables,
and salads were cultivated in gardens. Before the
end of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s reign, the American root, the potato,
began to be grown, though little used for a long time.
The decay of towns ceased with the new growth of trade
and the increase of manufactures, so that men, who under
<persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. or <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>. had no alternative but to
become sturdy beggars, were able to find employment at
home, or to take to the sea, or serve in the constant wars
abroad, or emigrate to distant parts of the earth. Even
gentlemen did not scruple to take to piracy. Harrison
lamented the absence of plantations, yet the failure of the
Plantation of Munster showed that there was no longer a
great unemployed class, eager to take up new occupations.
Yet till the end of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s reign there were still
plenty of beggars and thieves, despite sharp laws sharply
executed.</p><p>
  With the increase of wealth and prosperity, all classes
of the community profited. The yeoman class revived.






            <pb id="p.161" n="161"/>

" These were they," says Harrison, " who in times past made
all<placeName key="France">France</placeName> afraid." " They now," he adds, " commonly live
wealthily, keep good houses, and travail to get riches."
"Many by their labour and industry have got so much
wealth that they have bought up the lands of the unthrifty
gentry." The artificer and the husbandman were no less
prosperous, and Harrison cannot praise these classes too
highly: "so merry without malice, and plain without
inward craft, that it would do a man good to be in company
among them." With the hope of keeping up the
supply of skilled workmen, which the decayed guild system
of the Middle Ages had provided for, the famous Act of
Apprentices was passed in <date value="1563">1563</date>,
enacting that no one
should be allowed to exercise a trade until he had served
a seven years' apprenticeship at it: but the law raised as
many problems as it solved.  The unskilled labourer
profited but slightly from the general improvement, since
wages rose little, and prices grew rapidly.</p><p>
  7. The stern statesmen of early Tudor times refused to
contemplate a class of men who were willing to work but
could get no employment, though the history
of the period shows clearly that such a class of
<note place="foot" n="15"> the Beginnings.of the poor law</note>
did exist. They attempted to stamp out by
harsh laws the swarm of sturdy beggars who preferred a
lawless, vagabond life to honest labour, while they allowed
the sick and impotent to solicit public charity. Henry
VIII.'s law gave the deserving poor licences to beg, and
ordered the church-wardens of every parish to collect
alms in church, which they were to devote to the maintenance
of the poor. The able-bodied beggar was to be
"tied to the end of a cart, naked, and be beaten with
whips till his body be bloody by reason of such whipping."
Barbarous as this law was, the Act of <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>. repealed
it, because of " the foolish pity and mercy" shown by those
who should have carried it out, and sought as we saw [see
page 57] to put down vagabondage by branding, slavery,
and a felon's death. This brutal law was repealed within
two years, and <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s Act revived, with more careful
provision for the collection of alms by the appointment
of collectors who were to request all householders to give a
weekly sum, and had power to report to the bishop all those
who refused to set apart some proportion of their means
for the relief of the poor. Under <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> a systematic
Poor-Law gradually grew up. In <date value="1563">1563</date> <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s First
Poor-Law made compulsory the contributions to be collected







<pb id="p.162" n="162"/>
for poor relief. In <date value="1572">1572</date> <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s Second Poor-Law
further systematised the whole plan. It was no longer
left for each individual to assess himself, and the collectors
of the rate were "to build habitations for the impotent
and aged, and send strangers back to their own homes."
Side by side with this were new laws against vagabonds,
who were to be "grievously whipped." At last, in <date value="1597">1597</date>
and <date value="1601">1601</date>, two more statutes, the Third and Fourth Poor-Laws
of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, set up our poor-law system  as it
remained until the new Poor-Law passed in <date value="1834">1834</date>.  By
these laws justices were ordered to nominate overseers in
each parish, who had power to raise the sums necessary
for the relief of the poor of that parish by taxing every
inhabitant. The law of <date value="1600">1600</date> was looked
upon as so satisfactory, that Robert Cecil boasted, " Our ordinary begging-poor
are now provided for." The poorest now had a legal
right to live.</p><p>
  8. The standard of comfort for all classes was greatly
raised in the course of the century. Under <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. a
<note place="foot" n="16">Increase ofluxury and comfort </note>
small class of the community had rioted in
somewhat barbaric profusion, but the mass of
 the commons had no other idea of luxury
than a gross abundance of victuals and drink. Even
the houses of the gentry were uncleanly; and fastidious
foreigners, like Erasmus, complained that it was the
common practice to conceal the filth of the floors by a
covering of rushes, which were renewed but once or twice
a year. The constant epidemics bore witness to the want
of sanitation, and the poorer people lived in wretched
houses built of mud. Queen Mary's Spaniards had noted
how "the English have their houses built of sticks and
dirt, though they fare like kings." Under <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> everything
changed. Instead of a "good round log under his
head," the meanest man had his bolster or pillow.  Despite
a great rise in prices, people now found money for
more luxuries. Stoves, chimneys, glazed windows, glass
drinking-vessels, rich hangings and carpets, solid oak
furniture artistically carved, sound and clean bedding, and
pewter platters instead of wooden ones, became common
even among farmers and townsmen. Even at an earlier
date an Italian observer had noted that "there is no small
innkeeper who does not serve his table with silver dishes
and drinking-cups, and no one, who has not in his house
silver plate to the value of one hundred pounds,is considered
by the English to be a person of any consequence." At last






                       <pb id="p.163" n="163"/>

Englishmen began to aim, not only at show, but at comfort.
The conveniences of modern civilised life were now first
freely available even to the rich.  A good idea of the
luxury that prevailed is given in a song which describes the
preparations at a great house for a royal visit:-</p><p>
<quote rend="blockquote">          "Set me fine Spanish tables in the hall,
          See they be fitted all ;
          Let there be room to eat
          And order taken that there want no meat.
          See every sconce and candlestick made bright
          That without tapers they may give a light.
          Look to the presence; are the carpets spread
          The dais o'er the head,
          The cushions in the chairs,
            And all the candles lighted on the stairs?
            Perfume the chambers, and in every case,
            Let each man have attendance in his place."</quote>
Lovers of old ways regretted the march of luxury.
" When our houses were builded of willow," said Harrison,
" then had we oaken men; but now our houses are come to
be made of oak, our men are not only become willow,
but many, through Persian delicacy crept in among us,
altogether of straw. Now have we many chimneys, and
yet our tenderlings complain of rheums and catarrhs."
</p><p>  9. Diet became more varied and wholesome. The introduction
of hops improved the quality and keeping-powers
of beer, but wine was still largely consumed. After the
Reformation had made many forget the ancient ecclesiastical
fast-days, attempts were made to prohibit the use of flesh
meat on Fridays and other fasts, lest the fisheries should
be discouraged  and the sea-faring  class
decline in prosperity. The rise in the prices
<note place="foot" n="17"> Food and Drink</note>
of wheat and rye, the popular bread-stuffs, forced many poor
men to eat bread made of "horse-corn," such as beans, peas,
oats, and lentils; but as a rule there was plenty of meat
and beer for all ranks. While the nobles, "whose cooks
are for the most part musical-headed Frenchmen and
strangers," exceeded in the number and changes of meat,
the merchants were as lavish at their feasts as their social
superiors. Most men ate only two meals a day, dinner at
eleven, or twelve, and supper at five or six.</p><p>
  10. Dress was varied a good deal during the century.
Early in the century, men wore more gorgeous and extravagant
clothes than women. <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.
was dressed, when he met Francis at the Field    <note place="foot" n="18"> Dress</note>
of the Cloth of Gold, in "a garment of cloth of silver, of





<pb id="p.164" n="164"/>

damask, ribbed with cloth of gold, so thick as might be; the
garment was large and pleated very thick." On ordinary
occasions men wore a short coat, cut low in the neck, with
a loose gown with long sleeves by way of over garment,
long hose and broad-toed shoes, and handsome hats made
of velvet or cloth. The ladies wore close-fitting dresses,
with long tight sleeves, and an ugly close-fitting headgear
that concealed the hair, which was dragged back, and
stowed away in a round cap at the back of the head. As
the century went on, women's dress became richer and
more costly, but less graceful and dignified. <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
herself set a very bad example by her barbarous extravagances.
Puritan satirists had an easy mark in the
new fashion of dressing hair, " frizzled and crisped, laid out
on wreaths and borders, propped with forks and wire, and
surmounted by gold wreaths, bugles and gewgaws." A
characteristic feature was the ruff, in its origin a loose
collar, brought in by the Spaniards, but before long so
ridiculously exaggerated, that a great fan-like structure of
lace or lawn was upheld by wires, till it overtopped the
fantastically dressed hair, and starch, " the devil's liquor,"
as Puritans called it, was invented to stiffen the fabric.
Women wore long-peaked "stomachers," to make them
long-waisted like the queen, and ate gravel and tallow, to
get <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s fair complexion; while they dyed their hair
red to suit the queen's colour. Equally ridiculous was the
hoop or farthingale, also a Spanish invention, which grew
to an enormous size. Men's dress followed suit, though
with less extravagance.  They now  wore trunk-hose,
stuffed so tightly that they were hard to get into, and
beneath them curiously wrought stockings. Boots were so
elaborate that no gentleman could walk even for a small
distance, and many of both sexes kept themselves out of
the mud by the Venetian high-heeled shoe, called a
"chopine." Hats were exceedingly elaborate; and fashion
changed from year to year. " Except it were a dog in a
doublet," exclaimed Harrison, "you shall not see any so
disguised as are my countrymen of England."</p><p>
  11. Class distinctions were still strong, though it became
easier for men to rise from one class to another. The gentry
<note place="foot" n="19">Classes of Society.</note>
stood as a rank apart, though the wealthy
merchant, or the successful professional man,
found that it was by no means impossible for him to join
their numbers.  The professions grew  in importance,
though the one great profession of the Middle Ages, that of






       <pb id="p.165" n="165"/>

the clergy, was in a depressed condition. The Reformation
had left the clergy a poor and despised class, unpopular
with the laity, and of mean social estimation.
<note place="foot" n="20">The Clergy.</note>
There were few livings now that would support
a scholar, and by the middle of the century, the universities,
which earlier in the century had shown increasing affection
to the new learning, became desolate, and there was imminent
danger of their colleges following the fate of the
monasteries, though under <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> a revival took place.
Harrison complains that careless patrons sold their livings,
or presented their servants and dependents to them. The
owners of the monastery lands would not give enough to
pay competent vicars to serve the churches whose tithes
had gone to them on the fall of the religious houses. The
married clergy were hardly pinched, even where the celibate
priest might have lived in comfort. <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> robbed and
bullied her bishops, and the local magnates followed her
example by ill-treating the parish clergy. ' The Church,"
says Harrison, " is now the ass for every man to ride
on."</p><p>
  Other professions grew up at the expense of the clerical
class. The lawyers throve and multiplied. "All the wealth
of our land," says Harrison, "doth now flow
<note place="foot" n="21">Lawyers, Physicians, and surgeons.</note>
unto our common lawyers. The time hath
been when our lawyers sat in Paul's upon
stools, against the pillars, to get clients, but now some of
them will not come from their chambers to the Courts for
under ten pound." The Inns of Court now became great
law-schools, giving much prestige to the barrister, so that
many country gentlemen and men of family went up to
London for a few terms to study law in them. The
medical profession saw its status improved under Henry
VIII., who established regius professorships of physic at
Oxford and Cambridge, and in <date value="1518">1518</date> gave a charter to
Linacre, and other leading practitioners, incorporating
them as the College of Physicians. Henry also gave a
charter to the College of Barber-Surgeons, and an Act of
Parliament of his time separated these two classes that
had hitherto been confused, by ordering that no barber
should practice surgery, and no surgeon should shave
people or dress their hair. Physicians and surgeons
demanded such high fees, that Latimer complained that
" physic is a remedy prepared only for rich folks, for the
poor is not able to wage the physician." It was long before
the new spirit began seriously to affect medical practice,




<pb id="p.166" n="166"/>
but the age of the Renascence saw the casting off of the
ancient authorities, that had prevented the progress of
knowledge, and with the revived study of anatomy,
medicine became more scientific, and more efficacious.</p><p>
  12. Education became more comprehensive. Though
the Elizabethans were careless of tradition, and proud of
<note place="foot" n="22">The Education of a Gentleman.</note>
their superiority over their forefathers, there
  was no previous time in which general culture
was so much sought after as part of the equipment of a
gentleman. In the Middle Ages, study was confined to a
professional class of scholars.  That class was still in
existence, and held in high honour, but the rude unlettered
noble of the Middle Ages was replaced by the cultivated,
intelligent, scholarly gentleman of the Elizabethan age.
Well-read and learned women were not rare, and the
ladies at <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s court commonly spoke several languages
with fluency. But the Renascence idea of education went
further than this. A gentleman was not only
to be cultivated, but an expert in fencing and all manly exercises,
polished in manner, and careful and elegant in his
garb. It was a result of this wider view of education that
travel became more common. It was now a part of every
gentleman's, as well as of every scholar's education, to visit
<note place="foot" n="23">Travel.</note>    Italy, whence they brought back, along with
greater refinement and keener intellectual and
artistic tastes, a recklessness in morals, and a contempt for
religion that too often made the "Italianate Englishman a
devil incarnate." Italian influence was strong in every
department of Elizabethan life; and, when Italy itself had
outlived its best days, some touches of its former fine spirit
extended itself to England. Within England communication
became easier, and, though most men and women still
travelled from place to place on horseback, coaches were
introduced, which, though cumbrous, heavy and springless,
were looked upon as dangerous luxuries, which only the
effeminate would presume to use. All travellers went armed,
even the clergy generally had a hanger or a dagger, and
the lay traveller seldom went abroad without pistols.
Gentlemen always wore rapiers, and most men carried
daggers. The roads were still infested with robbers.</p><p>
  13. The changes in architecture marked the completely
altered temper of the times. Under <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>., large and
<note place="foot" n="24">Architecture.</note>
stately Gothic buildings were still constructed, as, for example, Bath Abbey or <persName key="Henry VII">Henry VII</persName>.'s
Chapel at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, though there is little of the best







                  <pb id="p.167" n="167"/>

Gothic spirit in them.  Even after the Reformation the
Gothic fashion lingered on, and since, instead of building
new churches, men were mostly engaged in pulling down old
ones, it is rather in manor houses, castles, and halls, than
in ecclesiastical structures, that the old spirit continued.
Gradually the taste for classical or Renascence architecture
was brought over from<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and Italy, though even then
builders continued to build on Gothic lines, while enriching
their structures with classical ornaments and details.
The ultimate result of this process was the effective,
though composite style, which we often call Elizabethan.
The best examples of this are to be seen in the sumptuous
and luxurious country houses, which the nobles of the
time reared for themselves. Pure Gothic for this purpose
went out with Wolsey's beautiful palace at Hampton Court,
though it long lingered on in the numerous colleges built
or rebuilt at Cambridge and Oxford up to the middle of the
next century. Good examples of the newer style can be seen
in Knole and Penshurst (the home of the Sidneys) in Kent.
The Protector Somerset brought into England an Italian
architect, John of Padua, to build his great palace in the
Strand; and a stronger Italian influence is seen in houses
like Longleat and Hardwick, in the ruins of Leicester's
palace at Kenilworth, and to a less extent in Wollaton,
near Nottingham. The conservative Harrison, while rejoicing
in the "many goodly houses erected in this island,"
preferred the simpler and solider style of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s
time, and speaks contemptuously of the newer sort, as
"rather curious to the eye, like paper-work, than substantial
for continuance," though experience has now proved
that the fantastic over-ornamentation of the Elizabethan
mansion has not prevented it standing the wear and tear
of time. The houses of the newer fashion were marked by
spacious galleries, great windows filled with glass, chimneys
to carry off the smoke, while within them were elaborate
furniture and fittings, that made life much more luxurious
than in the cramped castles of the Middle Ages. There was
no longer any need to fortify private houses, since life and
property were now fairly secure. Gentlemen could now
surround their homes with fair gardens, and pleasant
parks, wherein they took great delight.</p><p>
   The other arts were less flourishing than architecture, and
 the best that was done in them was mainly produced by
 foreigners.  There was indeed an English school of
 musicians, including a great band of madrigal writers, and






<pb id="p.168" n="168"/>

church-composers, like Merbecke and Tallis, who enriched
the Protestant service books with dignified and appropriate
<note place="foot" n="25">Music.</note>
 music.  In <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s reign, songwriters,
like Byrd and Dowland, gained a
 deserved reputation for sweetness and strength; and Dr.
 Thomas Campion was-not only a famous composer of
 music, but wrote words to his songs, that show him to
 have been a graceful and eloquent lyric poet.   The
 English painters and sculptors were, however, of little
 merit. Foreigners such as John of Mabuse had been
 employed by English patrons, but in the early part of
 the period, England could produce no better painter than
 John Crust, who recorded the splendours of the Field
 of the Cloth of Gold, with wooden fidelity to appearances.
 <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>., who royally loved art, gave pensions to
 various foreigners, mostly Flemings, but including some
 Italians, through whose work we possess representations
<note place="foot" n="26">Sculpture and  Painting.</note>
 of at least the outward appearance of the
nobles and courtiers of his time.  A very
 marked the appearance of the
 famous German, Hans Holbein, first of Augsburg and then
 of Basel, who came to England in <date value="1526">1526</date>, with letters of
 introduction from Erasmus to More, and who soon enjoyed
 such constant patronage, that, save for a few holiday visits
 to Basel, he remained in England till his death of the
 plague in <date value="1543">1543</date>.  His uncompromising truthfulness and
 great technical skill enabled him to paint Henry and his
 age as they really were. And even more important to us
 than his paintings is his collection of drawings, preserved
 at Windsor, which sets forth with rare ability the character
 and fashions of the time. Holbein left no school here,
 and, after his death, portraiture fell to meaner hands, such
 as the weak Gwillim Stretes, who painted the notabilities
 of <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>.'s. time; the more vigorous Sir Antonio
 More, a Fleming trained in the Italian school, who was paid
 high prices for his sombre and dignified representations
 of Mary and her court; the Italian Federigo Zucchero, the
 best of the painters of the vain but thrifty <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>; and
 the whole crowd of refugees from the Low Countries, like
 Mark Gheeraerdts of Bruges, who were also fashionable in
 their day. Better art was shown by the rising school of
 miniaturists, led by Nicholas Hilliard, a Devonshire goldsmith,
 and the Frenchman Isaac Oliver, and his son Peter,
 whose works make the first faint step towards an English
school of painting. Sculpture was at an even lower ebb, as







           <pb id="p.169" n="169"/>

most Elizabethan tombs show, with all their picturesque
quaintness. The most notable examples of that art were
the effigies of <persName key="Henry VII">Henry VII</persName>. and his mother, the Lady
Margaret, made for <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> Abbey by Torrigiano, the
most eminent of the Italian artists that <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. succeeded
in enlisting for a time in his service. While her
father welcomed great artists to his court, <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> had
neither the wish nor the money largely to employ them. But
the higher standard of artistic sensibility that had now grown
up is seen in the greater merit as works of art of her coins,
which, moreover, by reason of their containing good weight
of honest gold and silver, did much to revive English
trade, distracted by <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. and his first successors'
debasements of the currency.</p><p>
  14. For nearly three-quarters of the sixteenth century,
the amount of good literature produced in England was not
large. In the early part of the period, the
<note place="foot" n="27">Early Tudor Literature,</note>
printing-press made what was best in the old
literature more easily accessible, and the love of reading
spread more widely.  The taste for Chaucer's style still
lived on, and the poets of the time still modelled their
verse upon his.  Conspicuous among them
<note place="foot" n="28">The old schoolof poets.</note>
	was Stephen Hawes, a follower of Lydgate's,
	who died about <date value="1523">1523</date>.
	The ancient tradition still remained
stronger and more fruitful in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, where William
Dunbar and Gawin Douglas worthily upheld the school of
<persName key="James I">James I</persName>. and Henryson, which later put forth its last utterances
in Sir David Lindsay (d. <date value="1555">1555</date>),
a herald and a courtier
of James V., who attacked the abuses of Church and State,
in strong biting satires that did much to prepare the way
for the Reformation. Another old-fashioned poet was John
Skelton, whose short doggerel rimes, denouncing his archenemy,
Wolsey, have some freshness and vigour, and whose
pretty lyrics show the last declining rays of Chaucerian
influence. The real literary importance of the early part
of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s reign rests rather with the bringing in
of the Renascence impulse by a band of young scholars
than in the amount of actual literary production.  The
one notable English-born book of the time was More's
Utopia, which was written in Latin, but                     		    <note place="foot" n="29">The scholars ofthe New Learning.</note>
which, though addressed to the cosmopolitan
world of scholars, of whom Erasmus was the
chief, had a very definitely English bearing, if not in the
remedies that it suggested, at least in the evils which
it unveiled [see chap. i. pp. 21-22].  By the influence of







<pb id="p.170" n="170"/>

More and his friends, England was brought into close
touch with the deepest movements of the great European
world, just at the moment when the Reformation was to
break up for ever the cosmopolitan world of scholars, who
used Latin as their familiar idiom, and, like Erasmus, had
friends in all countries, though belonging to none themselves,
What was actually written in prose in English was of a
more commonplace sort; though the great output of dull
ordinary books, more valuable for their matter than for
their manner, should not be forgotten.  The patriotic
impulse made history a favourite study. Lord Berners
  (d. <date value="1533">1533</date>), beguiled the leisure of his Calais command by
  his idiomatic and racy translation of Froissart, which delighted
  the revived chivalry that followed <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. to
  the field against Francis of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>. A whole school of
  chroniclers, such as Fabyan, Grafton and Hall, the London
  alderman, told in abundant detail, and with some rude skill,
  the recent annals of England; and More himself wrote a
  History of Richard III., which expanded the orthodox
 Lancastrian theory of the usurper's character ;
<note place="foot" n="30">  prose writers</note>
while antiquarian and topographical research
  was represented by the patient and unwearied Leland,
  and Latimer's shrewd, homely, forcible Sermons have real
  literary value. Sir Thomas Elyot described in his book on
  The Governour (<date value="1531">1531</date>) the ideal of the education of a
  gentleman; and, at a rather later date, that robust <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName> scholar,
  Roger Ascham (<dateRange from="1515" to="1568">1515-1568</dateRange>), set forth in
  straightforward English, such as the people themselves
  spoke, the praises of archery and old-fashioned ways in
  his Toxophilus, and in his Schoolmaster strove to make it
  easier for children to learn the Latin tongue. Ascham was
  in some ways the most characteristic English writer of his
  time. A convinced but prudent reformer, he won over Henry
  VIII. by his love of English sports, and survived to uphold
  ancient ways during the reign of his pupil <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>.
  Though changes were more slowly wrought in prose than
  in verse, it is hardly too much to say that Ascham stands to
  prose almost as Wyatt and Surrey stand to English verse.</p><p>
    15. The Italian impulse which Ascham so profoundly
  hated first made its mark on English poetry through its
<note place="foot" n="31">  Wyatt and  Surrey, and the new school ofpoetry </note>
  influence on Sir Thomas Wyatt, a courtier
  and diplomatist of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>. (d. <date value="1542">1542</date>), and
  on Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (d. <date value="1547">1547</date>),
 the last victim of Henry's jealous wrath ; who,
  though he never visited Italy, followed and bettered Wyatt,






          <pb id="p.171" n="171"/>

in reading and imitating her poets. "Wyatt and Surrey,"
wrote an Elizabethan critic, "were novices newly crept out
of the schools of Dante, Ariosto, and Petrarch, and greatly
polished our rude and homely manner of vulgar poesy."
They both employed Italian metres, such as the sonnet
and the ottava rima, and Surrey (though Wyatt failed to
acclimatise the terza rima) was able to bring in the
" strange metre" of blank verse, also suggested by the
Italians, which was to prove so potent a weapon in the hands
of our dramatists for two generations. Both poets were
extensively read in manuscript, and became popular and
widely imitated.  When the verses of Wyatt and Surrey
and their followers were first printed in Tottel's Miscellany,
(<date value="1557">1557</date>), so called from the bookseller Tottel who published
it, the new impulse had been given from which Elizabethan
poetry was to spring.</p><p>
  The progress of the new spirit in poetry was extremely
slow. For the first twenty years of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s reign a
swarm of minor poets exercised themselves
<note place="foot" n="32">Early Elizabethan poetry.</note>
in the metres of Wyatt and Surrey, but very
few of them produced work of permanent or original merit.
His own time praised George Gascoyne
(d. <date value="1577">1577</date>) as "a
witty gentleman, and the very chief of our late rimers";
but his fame soon passed away.  In <date value="1559">1559</date>
and <date value="1563">1563</date> were
published the two volumes of an historical poem called, A
Mirrorfor Magistrates, written by various hands, in which,
amidst much inferior verse, the grave and stately Induction
by Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, reaches the highest
level of imagination that was attained by the early Elizabethan
poets. More verse was written than was printed,
as gentleman preferred to circulate their rimes in manuscript a
mong their friends, and there was hardly as yet a
professional literary class. It was an Italian fashion to
publish miscellaneous volumes of verse; and the Paradise
of Dainty Devices, issued in <date value="1576">1576</date>,
contains a typical collection of the poetic work
of the period.  An increasing
output of stirring ballads represented the more popular
side of poetry. Good dictionaries (such as Florio's), and
grammars, and a whole literature of translations in verse
and prose enabled those who were not professed scholars
to study and appreciate the masterpieces of classic and
Italian literature. The romantic fiction of Italy and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>
was thus made extremely popular, and gave our authors
subjects and models for the creation of similar literature in
English.  Books on arts, crafts, and accomplishments,







<pb id="p.172" n="172"/>
began to be written in England. FitzHerbert's Husbandry
and Surveying, Tusser's Five Hundred Points of Good
Husbandry (in verse), and George Silver's Paradoxes of
Defence, a treatise on sword-play, are excellent examples.
The fashionable Platonic mysticism even penetrated to
England, and its greatest professor, Giordano Bruno,
stayed in England, was a friend of Philip Sidney and
his set, and not without influence on<persName key="Shakespeare, William">Shakespeare</persName> himself.
The fierce theological controversies of the time
produced a copious stream of pamphlets and polemical
works, conspicuous among which was Bishop Jewel's Latin
Apology for the Church of England, and John Foxe's Acts
and Monuments, better known as Foxe's Book of Martyrs,
which described with simple vigour, though with little care
for truth, the pathetic history of the Protestants who died
for their faith, and belaboured the friends of the old Church
with coarse violence. The Scottish prose classic of the period
is without doubt John Knox's History of the Reformation.
 </p><p> 16. The critical years in the political history of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s
 reign were those in which true Elizabethan literature
<note place="foot" n="33">The relation between Literature and Action and the transition to the Great Age.</note>
bursts forth with strange suddenness and
 glory. Between <date value="1579">1579</date> and <date value="1582">1582</date>, Drake came
  home from his voyage round the world; the
Jesuits and the seminary priests set forth on
  their mission to win back England to the old
faith; Philip sent Spanish troops, and the Pope a legate, to
stir up  <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>; Esme Stewart plotted a Counter-Reformation in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>; <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> openly helped the revolted
Netherlanders; and Gilbert and Raleigh first indulged in
their dreams of English colonies in the New World. With
the publication of Spenser's Shepherd's Calendar (<date value="1579">1579</date>),
begins the flowering-time of Elizabethan poetry. The prose
romances date from the printing of Lyly's Euphues in
<date value="1579">1579</date>, and the composition of Philip Sidney's Arcadia in
<date value="1580">1580</date>.  Sidney's Apology for Poetry, written about the
same time, worthily begins our later critical literature. In
<date value="1582">1582</date>, Watson's Hecatompathia began the great outburst
of sonneteering. A few months before Drake started for
his voyage round the world, Burbage opened the first
English theatre in Shoreditch, and ten years later, in <date value="1587">1587</date>,
the date of the execution of Mary Stewart, Marlowe produced,
in his play of Tamburlaine, the first masterpiece of
the Elizabethan drama. From these memorable years
onwards, there is no cessation to the flow of great works.
The most creative and original period of English literature





               <pb id="p.173" n="173"/>

gilded the old age of the Island Queen with undying glory;
and the chief masters continued their work well into the
next century, for much of what is almost distinctively Eliza
bethan was written under <persName key="James I">James I</persName>.</p><p>
  17. With the publication of The Shepherds Calendar
Edmund Spenser became the first great poet of the new era.
His fame was still new when he settled down,
<note place="foot" n="34"> Edmund Spenser and the new poetry.</note>
as we have seen, in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, whence he was
driven, after nearly twenty years of prosperity,
by the last Desmond rising, to die next year in London,
poor and disappointed, though never neglected. His unfinished
epic the Faerie Queen, written in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, and
published in <date value="1589">1589</date> and
<date value="1598">1598</date>, enshrined in the richest and
most musical of verse all that was best in the spirit of the
English Renascence, love of fancy and chivalry, enthusiasm
for culture, delight in allegory, in mystic Platonism, in
quaint adventure and in old-fashioned fairy tales, burning
patriotic enthusiasm for England and her queen, earnestness
of moral purpose and complete sensuous enjoyment of
beauty, and fierce hatred of the Pope and the Spaniard,
who seemed embodiments of all that was unlovely and
evil.</p><p>
  Spenser is one of the foremost of English poets, but the
fine imagination and art that appear so prominently in
his work were reflected in the verses of a crowd of lesser
singers, who caught some sparks of his poetic spirit. His
famous master Ariosto was made to live in the English
tongue by Sir John Harington's flowing translation of
the Orlando Furioso, while Edward Fairfax's refined and
poetic rendering of Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered did the
same service for another of his Italian models. George
Chapman's translation of Homer told the tales of Achilles
and Ulysses in a way that went straight home to the Englishman
of the Elizabethan age. Spenser's Amoretti or lovesonnets
ushered in the great circle of sonneteers, though
themselves strongly influenced by the Sonnets in which his
friend and patron, Philip Sidney, immortalised an unhappy
love for Penelope Devereux, Lady Rich, the "Stella" of his
poems. The sonnets and love poetry of the time continued
to be issued in miscellanies, such as England's Helicon and
Davison's Poetical Rhapsody. They reach their supreme
height in<persName key="Shakespeare, William">Shakespeare</persName>'s Sonnets. But nothing shows so
powerfully how the pure spirit of poetry was in the air than
the exquisite grace and spontaneity of many a nameless
and forgotten lyric to be found lurking in the song-books





<pb id="p.174" n="174"/>

of the time, or flashing like jewels amid the mass of Elizabethan
dramatic literature.</p><p>
Many other types of poetry flourished. From the impulse
 given by the Mirror for Magistrates sprang the patriotic
 poetry which culminated in the History of the Civil Wars of
 the "well-languaged" Samuel Daniel, and in England's
 Heroical Epistles, and the other lengthy historical poems of
 Michael Drayton, who in his Polyolbion sought to glorify
 in sonorous verse all the wonders of Britain. Both Daniel
 and Drayton were also conspicuous among the sonnet
 writers, though neither of them kept up long to their
 highest level, either in lyric or narrative verse. A deeper note
 is struck in the philosophical Platonic poems of Sir John
 Davies, and in the melancholy force and gravity of Fulke
 Greville, Lord Brook, while William Drummond of Hawthornden's
 graceful love sonnets and solemn religious
 poems, and the Earl of Selkirk's fine plays, showed that
 some touch of the Elizabethan spirit had crossed the
 Scottish border.</p><p>
 18. Faithfully as Elizabethan poetry mirrors back the
 spirit of the great age, its fullest and largest life is best
<note place="foot" n="35"> The beginnings of the Elizabethan Drama.</note>
 represented by the wonderful outburst of
dramatic literature, which is its unique glory.
The old mysteries and moralities [see part i.
 p. 274], which had been acted for many generations, were
 now on the decline, though they still kept up a popular
 taste for dramatic performances of a rude sort, while since
 <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.'s time comic Interludes, such as John Heywood
 wrote for the bluff king's court, gradually added a
 more human interest to the drama than could be got from
 the allegories, in which the morality writers set forth
 abstract representation of Virtues and Vices. The scholars
 of the Universities and Inns of Court, inspired by the spirit
 of the Renascence, read and acted Latin plays, such as
 those of Seneca and his Italian imitators, and gradually
 began to copy them in English. Before long they wrote
 dramas that seemed more adapted to English taste, and
 thus bit by bit a rude dramatic literature grew up by the
 middle of the sixteenth century. Bishop Bale's King John,
 though still mixed up with the machinery of the morality,
 prepared the way for the dramatic presentations of English
history, which stirred up the patriotism of the age of the
Armada. The disreputable Eton schoolmaster, Nicholas
Udal, gave a boisterous picture of London life in Ralph
Roister Doister, our first comedy; and Lord Buckhurst




           <pb id="p.175" n="175"/>

finished before <date value="1562">1562</date> the dull and formal Gorboduc, the first
regular tragedy.  During the next twenty years playwriting
became common, and, though most of these plays
had not much literary merit, or sustained interest, the
representation of them became a widespread popular
amusement.</p><p>
  19. At first plays were acted in the halls of gentlemen's
houses, in the courtyards of inns or in any other possible
spot. A new departure was made in <date value="1576">1576</date>,when
<note place="foot" n="36"> The firsttheatres.</note>
a company of players that were patronised by
Leicester, at the head of which was James Burbage built
The Theatre at Shoreditch, the first building set apart for
dramatic performances in the country. After this theatres
soon multiplied. As the Puritan magistrates of London
showed great hostility to the players, partly because of
their free living and partly because  they acted plays on
Sundays, Burbage and his fellows found it prudent to build
their theatres in the suburbs. The Curtain soon arose hard
by The Theatre in Shoreditch, and in <date value="1598">1598</date> Burbage's son
built the famous Globe Theatre at Bankside on the Surrey
side of the Thames hard by the Paris Garden, whither the
citizens flocked on Sunday and holidays to enjoy the
brutal but favourite sport of bull and bear-baiting. The
Globe was a summer theatre, and the same actors played
in wintertime at the Blackfriars Theatre, within the City,
erected by the elder Burbage in <date value="1596">1596</date>.  These were the
chief Elizabethan playhouses.  Though there was little
profit to be made as yet by the penning of plays, the drama
became so fashionable an amusement that large sums could
be made by the proprietors of the playhouses, and a thrifty
actor and playwright, who invested  his  savings in shares
in the theatres, was able, like<persName key="Shakespeare, William">Shakespeare</persName>, to retire in
middle life on a comfortable fortune, or, like his friend
Alleyn, become the lord of a suburban manor and grantor of
considerable estate to such a pious and charitable foundation
as Dulwich College. The best of the Elizabethan theatres
were but rude structures, a circular or hexagonal building,
built of wood and partly covered with thatch, and largely
open to the weather, except on the side of the capacious
stage, which ran forward into the middle of the area, and
was big enough, not only to give ample room for the actors,
but to allow notable patrons to sit on stools at the back of
it to witness the performance, while the common people,
the " groundlings," stood closely packed in the pit. The few
ladies who attended hid themselves away masked in the






<pb id="p.176" n="176"/>

boxes, which were ranged in several tiers round the sides
of the house and protected those of the better quality from
the weather.  Performances were always  in the afternoon,
beginning between one and three o'clock. There
was no scenery, and the properties were poor, though
the dresses were often costly. Boys acted the women's
parts, and there was a constant variety in the performances.</p><p>
   20. With the opening of the first public theatres, the
 quality of English dramatic literare underwent a
<note place="foot" n="37"> Marlowe and the  first generation of the great dramatists.</note>
 marvellous change.  Soon after <date value="1580">1580</date>   a group
  of young men, who had got a taste for the
   drama at Oxford and Cambridge, settled down
 in London, where the lived roystering  and
 reckless lives, and began to write plays for the new theatres.
 These pieces were often bombastic, crude and  sensational,
 but they showed a fire, an action, and a vein of true poetry
 that promised better things from their writers. With the
 production of Tamburlaine the Great, by the most gifted of
 the number, Christopher Marlowe, in  <date value="1587">1587</date> the great age of
 the drama had definitely set in.  In a few years Lyly the
 Euphuist, Greene, Peele, Nash, Kyd, and a crowd of others
 began writing for the stage. After the success of Tamburlaine
 blank verse became the fashion, though the earlier
 plays  were largely written prose or rime. In the intemperate,
 passionate, and tragic career of Marlowe the first
 stage of the Elizabethan drama reached its culminating
 point. His greatest play is Dr. Faustus (about <date value="1589">1589</date>). He
 perished miserably in a tavern brawl before he was thirty
 (<date value="1593">1593</date>), yet in the  six or seven years, over which his
 dramatic career extended, his fiery passion and resistless
 force had raised him, despite many extravagances, to an
 immortal seat among the great poets of the world.</p><p>
 About the time of the production of Tamburlaine, William
<persName key="Shakespeare, William">Shakespeare</persName> (<dateRange from="1564" to="1616">1564-1616</dateRange>), a youth of two or three and twenty,
 <note place="foot" n="38">Shakespeare and his successors.</note>
 left his home and family at Stratford-on-Avon
  and came to London to push his fortunes. He
 soon made his way as an actor and a playwright, working up
 old plays into a more literary and attractive shape, and,
 strongly under the influence of Marlowe, made his first
 essays in original poetry and drama. His original plays
 begin with Love's Labour's Lost, with its satire on Euphuism,
 Arcadianism and the fashionable Latinist pedantry; and
 with the boisterous farce of the Comedy of Errors, founded
on one of Plautus' plays, already copied by Ariosto. By






       <pb id="p.177" n="177"/>

<date value="1592">1592</date> he had written his
fervid youthful tragedy of Romeo and
Juliet, and not long after was following hard on the steps
of Marlowe's <persName key="Edward II">Edward II</persName>. in his Richard III. About
<date value="1594">1594</date>
the Merchant of Venice shows that he had attained the full
height of his powers. His early poems were now published
and he had reached a high reputation, competent fortune,
and a distinguished social position. Before <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> died
he was a leading shareholder of the Globe, the owner of
New Place, the finest house in Stratford town, and is
described in legal documents as "<persName key="Shakespeare, William">William Shakespeare</persName>,
gentleman of Stratford." There was such a demand for his
plays that. though the theatre managers seldom gave them
to the world, unauthorised and piratical editions began to
be issued of the more popular of them. He had written
As You Like It, Julius Ccesar, and Hamlet, and was already
recognised by his fellows as the greatest of their company,
almost as clearly as he has been hailed in after ages as
the greatest of poets of all time. His profound knowledge
of the human heart in all its phases, his naturalness, his
glowing fancy, his deep passion, abundant humour, unique
command of the mother tongue, wisdom, self-restraint and
ripeness of judgment stand by themselves in all literature.
Round him clustered a great school of dramatic writers,
whose work, beginning in the last years of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, came
to a climax under <persName key="James I">James I</persName>. [see book vii. chap. viii.], and
then slowly decayed, until the last of the Elizabethan
dramatists laid down his pen on the eve of the Great Civil
War.</p><p>
21. The prose literature of the later years of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
did not reach the same high level as poetry or the drama.
There were as yet few received standards
of prose composition, though force, energy,
<note place="foot" n="39"> Prose.</note>
inspiration, and matter did something to supply the want
of art, and the best spirit of the time is often discernible
beneath the quaint conceits, the tangled convolutions
and heavy sentences of the prose style of the period
The habitual use of the Book of Common Prayer, and
the wide circulation of the various translations of the
Bible, especially of the popular Calvinistic Genevan version,
did something to establish a standard of dignified
simple, and self-sustained style, though none of these
qualities are very evident in the extravagant controversial
pamphlet-literature that was so eagerly read, until the
majestic dignity of Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity raised
party polemics into sound literature. This book remained








<pb id="p.180" n="180"/>

revolution. The first half of the century had witnessed a
twofold religious revival. It saw the growth of Puritanism
and the growth of Arminian Anglicanism. The Anglicans
made common cause with the monarchy, and were overwhelmed
with it in the Puritan Revolution. But the nation
lamented the fall of the Church still more than the fall of
king and Parliament. The Restoration of king and Parliament
involved the restoration of the old Church.
 </p><p> The Restoration did not undo the work of the Puritan
Revolution. It put the authority of Church and king on a
broad basis of popular support. The direct rule of the
monarchy was nearing its end, and the nation, divided into
the two great parties, that aimed respectively at order and
progress, gradually assumed, through the House of Commons,
the control of its own destinies. However, <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.
and <persName key="James II">James II</persName>. were not loyal to the new state of things. They
sought to overthrow the Constitution both in Church and
State. Neither had men yet learnt tolerance. The restored
Church persecuted the Puritans it no longer retained within
its pale. The Revolution of <date value="1688">1688</date> was therefore necessary to
complete the triumph of Parliament which the revolution of
<date value="1641">1641</date> had begun, and to secure Toleration and Individual
Liberty.</p><p>
 </p><p> Besides this great struggle, half-political, half-religious,
the seventeenth century witnessed many other far-reaching
changes in England.
 </p><p> It saw a temporary eclipse of English power abroad. A
nation divided against itself could not make its influence
felt in the counsels of Europe. One result of this was the
establishment of the overwhelming preponderance of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>
under Louis XIV. But the glories of Cromwell's foreign
policy show that this decline was due to no deep-seated
causes.
 </p><p>  The seventeenth century witnessed a great development
of our wealth and prosperity, the beginnings of our trading
supremacy and Colonial Empire, and the first union of the
whole British islands under a single rule.  It saw a new
era in literature, and it beheld Englishmen for the first
time leading the world of scientific discovery. It was an
age of strange contrasts, but taking it as a whole it was a
glorious age.

 <p> 1. On  <date value="1603-03-24">March 24,1603</date>,
 James, King of Scots, was proclaimed King
 of England amidst general rejoicing. He
was a man of good height, with a fair delicate
skin, blue rolling eyes, and a tongue too large
<note place="foot" n="2">  Accession, character and policy of <persName key="James I">James I</persName>.</note>
for his mouth. Some weakness in his legs James .
made him walk with a shambling circular
gait, and sit very awkwardly on horseback. He was careless
in his dress, wearing his favourite clothes till they
were almost in rags, and his ungainly figure looked the
more clumsy since he quilted his doublet as a protection
against assassination. He never washed his hands, but
rubbed his fingers lightly with the wetted end of a napkin.
He lived simply on roast meat and fruit, and never ate bread.
Fond as he was of sweet wine, his strong head was never
disturbed by it. He spent most of his time in the country,
busied with hunting, hard study and gossiping with his
favourites.  His wife, Anne of Denmark, the sister of
Christian IV., had long yellow hair, and a white skin "far
more amiable than the features it covered." She was a
well-meaning frivolous woman, fond of masques and balls.
As she grew older she leant towards the Roman Catholics.
 </p><p> James was good-natured and affectionate, an indulgent
husband and father, and a faithful friend. He was, however,
hot-tempered, nervous, cowardly and without any
sense of dignity or decorum. Possessed of plenty of ability,
he often took shrewd views of men and things, and had
been so well taught by the famous scholar, George Buchanan
that he had become the most learned prince in Europe.
He wrote clever but pedantic books about politics and
theology, and a furious "counterblast" against the new
habit of smoking tobacco, which he detested. He honestly
loved peace, and moderate courses; but he was weak and
unstable, and never turned his gifts to proper account. He
was extraordinarily vain and conceited, and easily moved
by flattery. He seemed quite a foreigner, with his rough
northern ways, and harsh Scottish tongue. He was now
thirty-seven years old, with fixed habits.</p><p>
   James was proud of his statecraft, and had a high notion






<pb id="p.182" n="182"/>  <note place="foot" n="3"><date value="1603">1603</date>--<date value="1615">1615</date></note>

of the divine right of kings, thinking it almost blasphemy
in subjects to go against the will of the Lord's Anointed.
He was always talking foolishly about the absolute power
of the crown, and saying that the liberties of the people
depended on his favour. But while he was magnifying the
monarchy in theory, the actual authority that <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> had
wielded slipped unnoticed from his hands. Yet James had
the wisdom to see that his right course was to follow as
closely as he could on <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s footsteps. But he never
really understood wherein the secret of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s strength
had rested. Above all he did not see that his interests
and those of his subjects were really the same, and, unlike
Queen <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, he took no pains to understand his people,
or carry out their wishes. He was quite out of touch with
public opinion. Under his rule the old Tudor harmony
between king and people came to an end. The personal
defects of the king soon embittered and precipitated the inevitable
conflict between them. A strong parliamentary
opposition, half political, half religious, grew up in antagonism
to the royal authority.  The result was the great
struggle between Crown and Parliament, which lasted nearly
all through the seventeenth century, and did not end until
the triumph of the Commons was secured by the driving
out of the Stewarts from the throne. The first act of this
long and fierce contest was fought out under James, but as
yet both parties to it were unconscious of where it would
take them.</p><p>
  2 The Council and ministers of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> were kept in
office, and with their help James strove to rule England
as the old queen had done. Sir Robert Cecil remained Secretary, and in
<note place="foot" n="4">Robert Cecil,
<dateRange from="1563" to="1612">1563-1612</dateRange>.</note>
<date value="1605">1605</date> was made Earl of
Salisbury.  He was so small a man that
James called him his "pigmy" and "little beagle," and
his enemies spoke of his "wry neck, crooked back and
splay foot." He was stiff and official in his ways, but
courteous, clear-headed and hard-working. So strong a
hold did he keep on power that foreign ambassadors described
James as a phantom king who left all the real work
of government to his ministers. So long as he lived, Cecil
kept up the traditions of Elizabethan statecraft. He was
jealous of opposition, and coldly discouraged the rising
ambition of his cousin, Francis Bacon (<dateRange from="1561" to="1626">1561-1626</dateRange>), the
brilliant Chancery barrister, whom he thought a mere
visionary. In the same way he looked upon the gallant Sir
Walter Raleigh (<dateRange from="1552" to="1618">1552-1618</dateRange>) as an unscrupulous adventurer.







  <pb id="p.183" n="183"/>

He preferred to trust men of narrower mould, such as the
Attorney-General, Sir Edward Coke (<dateRange from="1552" to="1634">1552- 1634</dateRange>), the
greatest of the common lawyers, but the hardest, most
pedantic and ungenial of men.</p><p>
  The discontented of every sort joined together in a series
of plots against Cecil. The selfish and cowardly Henry
Brooke, Lord Cobham, formed what was

<note place="foot" n="5">  The Main and the Bye Plots,<date value="1603">1603</date>.</note>
talked of deposing <persName key="James I">James I</persName>in favour of the
Lady Arabella Stewart, the daughter of Darnley's
younger brother, and an Englishwoman born. Quite
independent of Cobham's design was the Bye Plot, or the
Treason of the Priests. This was a foolish scheme of the
Roman Catholic secular priest, William Watson, to seize
James and keep him a prisoner until he gave freedom to
the Catholics, and made the conspirators his chief advisers.
But the Jesuits, who hated their rivals, the secular priests,
got hold of the story and revealed it to the ministers.
Before long the Main Plot was also discovered and
Cobham arrested. Thereupon he made a lying confession
which implicated his friend, the reckless and discontented Raleigh.
The conspirators were tried and condemned.
The guilty priests were executed, but nearly
all the laymen were pardoned at the foot of the scaffold.
Among those convicted was Raleigh, whose condemnation
had only been secured by very doubtful measures.
Attorney-General Coke conducted the prosecution with
coarse brutality. " Thou hast a Spanish heart," he cried,
"and thyself art a spider of hell.  There never lived a
viler viper than thou." Raleigh, though telling lies freely
to screen himself, behaved in the main with dignity.
Though the sentence passed against him was not carried
out, he was never formally pardoned. He remained many
years in the Tower with the death sentence still hanging
over his head, and amusing himself with experiments in
chemistry, and by inditing in sonorous prose his History of
the World. The Lady Arabella, who was quite innocent
of all treason, was treated kindly by James until, in <date value="1610">1610</date>,
she married William Seymour, who was dangerous to the
King as the grandson of Catharine Grey, and an inheritor
of her claims to the throne by the will of <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>.
She was then thrown into prison, where she died raving
mad in <date value="1615">1615</date>.</p><p>

 and Parliament, were the chief difficulties of the new

monarch. In <date value="1604">1604</date>, James, who hated war, made peace
with <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> by the Treaty of London, on terms which left

him free to help our allies, the Seven United
 Provinces, who continued the fight against
their old tyrants till the Twelve Years' Truce of <date value="1609">1609</date>. Robert
Cecil kept up friendly dealings with<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, and showed
watchful distrust of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. In <date value="1610">1610</date>, England joined Henry
IV.,the famous king who had restored the French monarchy,
to prevent the establishment of a Roman Catholic prince as
Duke of Cleves. It seemed as if a general war of Protestant
and Catholic were likely to break out in <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>; but the
murder of Henry IV. by a Catholic fanatic deprived the
German Protestants of the hope of French help, and peace
was restored. Louis XIII. (<dateRange from="1610" to="1643">1610-1643</dateRange>), the new king, was
a boy; and his mother, Mary de' Medici, was a great friend
of the Spaniards.  Salisbury continued our alliance with
the German Protestants.</p><p>
  4. The state of the English Church was still critical.
Despite the activity of Whitgift, many of the clergy still
<note place="foot" n="8">The Church and the Puritans.</note>
held Puritan opinions. The Scottish Church,
in which James had been brought up, almost
realised the ideals of Calvin, and the Puritans hoped that a
Presbyterian and Calvinistic king would sympathise with
their ways of thinking, and allow their views to prevail by
carrying out a further reformation of the church.  On
James's way to London, the Millenary Petition (so called
because it expressed the opinions of a thousand Puritans)
was presented to him, begging for a relaxation of the
<note place="foot" n="9">The Hampton Court Conference,<date value="1604">1604</date>.</note>
ceremonies, which they looked on as rags of
 Popery. James ordered a conference of the
two Church parties to meet at Hampton Court
on  <date value="1604-01-14">14 Jan.1604</date>. The Puritan clergy, led by Reynolds,
asked for a revision of the Prayer Book, a new translation
of the Bible, and the enforcement of Calvinist doctrines.
Bishop Bancroft, of London, almost the first Protestant
bishop to teach that a Church without bishops was no true
Church at all, was the spokesman of the friends of the
Elizabethan Settlement.  He reminded the Puritans of
the "Ancient Canon that schismatics were not to be
listened to when they spoke against their bishops"; but
the king, who delighted in theological argument, showed
a better temper, and agreed to order a revised translation
of the Bible. Yet James knew very well that his
interest lay in supporting the Elizabethan Settlement, and
he hated the Scottish system of church government which






  <pb id="p.185" n="185"/>

he regarded as hostile to his power. As soon as he saw
that the Puritans wanted to set up the Scottish system,
the king flew into a passion. "A Scottish Presbytery," he
cried, "agreeth as well with monarchy, as God with the
devil.  Stay for me seven years, and then if you find
me pursy and fat, I will perhaps harken unto you, but
until I am lazy let that alone." James thus declared his
adhesion to the church policy of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, and the
Puritans went away dissatisfied.  All that resulted from
the conference were some small changes in the Prayer
Book that pleased nobody, and the noble Authorised
Version of the Bible, which was finally published in
<date value="1611">1611</date>.</p><p>
  A few months afterwards Bancroft became archbishop
of Canterbury, on Whitgift's death, and turned out three
hundred Puritan ministers from their livings.
<note place="foot" n="10"> Beginnings of Arminianism.</note>
Bancroft's successor, George Abbot
(<dateRange from="1610" to="1633">1610- 1633</dateRange>)
, inclined towards Puritan views.  But the whole
current of Church opinion set in strongly against them.
Led by the holy ascetic Lancelot Andrewes, bishop of Ely
and then of Winchester, a new school of churchmanship
grew up which laid stress on the continuity of the Church
with the Church of the Middle Ages, insisted on the
necessity of the Apostolical Succession and of Episcopal
Ordination, held high views of Sacramental Grace, and
found in an elaborate ritual and in the symbolism of the
Middle Ages the best stimulants to devotion. They followed
the Dutch professor Arminius (from whom they were
called Arminians) in rejecting the cold Calvinism which all
parties had held under <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. Strong in his principle
of "No Bishop, No King," James himself, in later life,
leant towards their views, regarding the servile bishops as
the best check upon his unruly subjects, and the Church
as the safest prop of the throne.  In <date value="1621">1621</date>, Abbot, whose
influence had long been waning, had the misfortune to
shoot a keeper as he was hunting deer in Bramshill Park.
Friends of the new ways, such as the learned and indefatigable
William Laud, and the scheming Welshman John
Williams, refused to be consecrated as bishops by the
homicide, and for the rest of his life Abbot remained
under a cloud. Meanwhile, the Puritans were driven to
despair; many left the Church altogether and joined the
Brownist separatists, who were so harshly treated that
some of them  sought freedom to worship God in the
wildernesses of America. But the mass of the Puritans







<pb id="p.186" n="187"/> <note place="foot" n="11">[<date value="1605">1605</date>--<date value="1606">1606</date></note>

  remained discontented Conformists, hoping against hope
  for better days to come.</p><p>
    5. James had declared that he would not persecute the
  Roman Catholics so long as they remained good subjects,
 <note place="foot" n="12"> The popish  Recusants and the Gunpowder Plot, <date value="1605">1605</date>.</note>										             and made himself unpopular with the rigid
  Protestants by trying to suspend the cruel
  recusancy laws. But the Romanists, like the
  Puritans, wished not for toleration, but for
  supremacy: and James became alarmed at the numerous
  conversions to Popery.  Severe penalties were therefore
  imposed on the friends of the old faith, and several priests
  were executed. In despair, the more desperate recusants
  turned to treason. Robert Catesby, a Warwickshire gentleman
  of birth and property, whose handsome face, eager
  enthusiasm, and winning manners made him a born leader
  of men, formed a conspiracy to blow up the king and
  Parliament with gunpowder.  Thomas Percy, a kinsman
  and steward of the Earl of Northumberland, Thomas
  Winter, and John Wright fell eagerly into his scheme.
  They brought from <placeName key="Flanders">Flanders</placeName> Guy Fawkes, a Yorkshireman,
  who had fled from England through his zeal for the Pope,
  and had served as a soldier of fortune in the armies of the
  king of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. Fawkes' coolness and courage made him a fit
  instrument to carry out their desperate design. The conspirators
  now hired a coal-cellar underneath the House of
  Lords, where they piled up a great heap of powder barrels
  hidden under faggots with the object of blowing up King,
  Lords, and Commons on 5 November <date value="1605">1605</date>, the day of the
  meeting of Parliament. Money falling short, they added
  to their band three rich young gentlemen-Tresham, Rokewood,
  and Digby. A great gathering of Catholic gentry
  of the Midlands was to be collected on the pretence of a
  hunt at Dunchurch.   It was hoped that the assembly
  would rise in revolt when the news of the explosion spread,
  seize the Princess <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, James's little daughter, who
  was living at Combe Abbey near Coventry, and proclaim
  her as queen.</p><p>
     As Nov. 5 drew near the newer conspirators became
  uneasy at the Catholic lords being involved in the fate of
  their heretic colleagues. Catesby's fanatic zeal made light
  of the difficulty, but Tresham warned his brother-in-law,
  Lord Monteagle, not to attend Parliament.  Monteagle
  sent on his letter to Cecil, who gave the plotters full time
  to concert their schemes, and finally, on Nov. 4, carefully
  searched the cellars, discovered the powder, and took







 <pb id="p.187" n="187"/>

Fawkes prisoner.  The bold desperado boasted that he
was about to blow the Scots back again to <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, but
torture of the severest sort soon forced from him the
names of his accomplices  Meanwhile Catesby and the
rest rode in hot haste to Warwickshire, hoping still to carry
out the other part of this plot. But the huntsmen at Dunchurch
refused to rise in revolt, and the little band of thirty
conspirators fled to Holbeach, near Stourbridge, in Staffordshire.
An accidental explosion of the powder got to
defend the house hurt some, and frightened the rest as a
judgment of God. The Sheriff of Worcestershire came up
with the forces of the shire and surrounded the house.
Thoroughly cowed and disheartened, the plotters prepared
themselves by prayer for their last fight. Catesby and
Percy stood back to back, and, fighting desperately, were
shot down by the same bullet. Catesby crawled on his
knees to a picture of the Virgin and died kissing and
embracing it. Fawkes and his comrades in London were
executed as traitors, glorying in their deed.  Some Jesuit
priests, including Henry Garnett, the Provincial (or head)
of the order in England, were incriminated in the plot.
For nearly a week they hid in a hole in Hindlip Hall near
Worcester, " chiefly supported by broth conveyed by a reed
through a little hole in a chimney that backed another
chimney in a gentlewoman's chamber." But want of air drew
them "like ghosts" to surrender. At their trial Garnett
admitted that he had been told of the conspiracy under
the seal of confession, but protested that he abhorred the
murderous design. In May <date value="1606">1606</date> he suffered the penalties
of treason. Catholic Europe believed that a small picture
of the martyr, surrounded by rays of glory, had been
miraculously formed on a husk of straw on his scaffold.
The day of the deliverance from the Gunpowder Treason
was made a national holiday, and the stern laws against
the recusants were enforced with a new rigour.</p><p>
  6. James's want of success in dealing with the Puritans
and the Roman Catholics foreshadowed his failure to
understand the temper of his Parliaments. In the House
of Lords the new Tudor nobility had now acquired a
sufficient standing to be able to act with         				   <note place="foot" n="13">The King and the Parliament.</note>
independence and dignity, but they were
generally outvoted by the cringing bishops and the swarm
of courtier lords who owed their existence to James's
reckless prodigality in the distribution of peerages and
honours. However, the sturdy squires and merchants of







<pb id="p.188" n="188"/>  <note place="foot" n="14"><date value="1604">1604</date>--<date value="1608">1608</date></note>

the House of Commons had now learnt to take a wiser
and broader view of the national interests than the packed
parliaments of the Tudors, and not all the creations of
new boroughs, that represented nobody but the court and
ministers, could prevent the overwhelming preponderance
of the real representatives of the freeholders and men of
substance throughout the land. Strongly conservative in
their love of English ways and hatred of sweeping changes,
the Commons cherished the liveliest devotion to the
well-ordered liberty which was the traditional birthright of
all Englishmen, and were learning to look back, past the
despotism of the Tudors, to the palmy days of constitutional
freedom under the Edwards and Henrys. They now found
in the adroit and subtle lawyers of London spokesmen and
leaders, who were more than a match for the courtiers,
and before long the country gentry themselves began to
stand forth as orators and statesmen. Even before <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s
death, the monopoly quarrel had shown that the
House of Commons no longer re-echoed the policy of the
Crown as in Tudor times. James tried to take up the
same high line with his Commons as <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> had done,
but the man and the time combined to render his efforts
futile. The Commons had deferred to the wishes of the
old queen, but no ties of gratitude or interest prevented
their now taking up a more decided attitude. They were
determined to vindicate their rights against the king, and
watched even his most harmless actions with suspicion.
James, on the other hand, was full of well-meant plans of
great reforms, which they cared nothing about. He expected
as implicit an obedience as <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> had exacted. But
while <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> always realised that she and her subjects
were members of the same body politic, with common
interests and ambitions, James fell into a fatal habit of
bargaining with his people, like a sharp huckster cheapening his wares.</p><p>
  James's First Parliament met in March <date value="1604">1604</date>, and continued
  its sessions until <date value="1611">1611</date>. Francis Bacon was prominent
among the guiding spirits of its earlier debates. A
long wrangle at once broke out between king and Commons
about privilege of Parliament.  James had
<note place="foot" n="15">The First Parliament  of James, <dateRange from="1604" to="1611">
1604-11</dateRange>.The Session of<date value="1604">1604</date>  </note>
claimed that the Court of Chancery should
decide all disputed elections. The Commons
replied that their House alone was competent
to deal with questions affecting its own composition,
and succeeded in compelling James to give way.






 <pb id="p.189" n="189"/>

They then pressed for reforms in the Church, though protesting that they " had not come in any Puritan or Brownist
spirit to work the subversion of the state ecclesiastical as
it now stands." In the same spirit they demanded the
regulation of the abuses of the feudal customs of Purveyance and Wardship.'<note place="foot" n="16">Purveyance was the
ancient right of the crown to take from subjects such provisions
and goods as were necessary for the use of the
 king and his court, pa ing for them at the king's discretion.
 Wardship was the right of the crown to act as guardian for feudal tenants
 who came to their estates under age; the king receiving the profits of
 the estate as the reward of his trouble. Many attempts had been
 made to regulate both customs during the Middle Ages, but both
 were very liable to abuse.</note> James paid little attention to their
complaints, and annoyed them by declaring that their
privileges depended on his good pleasure, and could be
revoked at his will. They gave him no subsidy, but plenty
of wholesome advice. They drew up a straightforward and
manly Apology for their conduct. " If your Majesty," they
said, "will consider our petitions for ease of those burdens
under which your whole people have long time mourned,
then you may be assured to be possessed of our hearts
for ever." " I wish you would use your liberty with more
modesty" was James's petulant answer.     "If I should
show favour except there be obedience, I were no wise
man."   When Parliament separated    in July the great
struggle had begun all along the line.</p><p>
   The session of <date value="1606">1606</date> was mostly taken up in framing fresh
laws against the Popish recusants, who were made the
scapegoats of the Gunpowder Plot. The later
<note place="foot" n="17">The Proposed Union with <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, <date value="1608">1608</date>.</note>
sessions brought the relations of King and
Commons from bad to worse. In <date value="1608">1608</date>, James's
scheme for a further union with <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> was finally laid
before Parliament.  Though James was now king of both
kingdoms, the two realms were still as two foreign countries
in their relations to each other. The king wisely saw that
the personal Union of the Crowns needed to be supplemented by a political union of the kingdoms. He was
the more eager for this as his position in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> was so
much weaker than in England, and he wished to rule with
equal power in his old and in his new inheritance. He
looked forward to the time when there would be "one
Parliament, one law, one Church, and one nation."
Bacon seconded his plans with so much ardour, that
he was at last admitted to favour as Solicitor-General.








<pb id="p.190" n="190"/><note place="foot" n="18"><date value="1608">1608</date>--<date value="1614">1614</date>.]</note>

But the slow imagination of the country gentry saw
nothing of the brilliant visions of the king and the
philosopher, and believed that they were scheming to upset
the old Constitution for the benefit of the greedy and
poverty-stricken Northerners with whom England had been
so long at enmity. So strong was this feeling, that all
James ventured to ask for was, that Englishmen and Scotsmen should no longer be aliens in each other's country,
and that freedom of trade between the two nations should
be established. But all that he could get was the repeal of
the harsh laws that treated Scotsmen as enemies. Despairing
of Parliament, he turned to the judges, who, in Calvin's
Case (properly Colvill's Case), decided that the post native
that is, Scots born after James became King of England-were,
by virtue of their allegiance to the English King,
in the same position as natural born Englishmen
(<date value="1608">1608</date>),
thus declaring the ante nati-Scots born before
<date value="1603">1603</date>-foreigners.</p><p>
  James was heavily in debt, and sorely in want of money.
But he found difficulties even in raising the revenue which
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> had collected without the least
<note place="foot" n="19">Bate's Case, <date value="1606">1606</date>
and the New Impositions,<date value="1608">1608</date>.</note>
trouble. In <date value="1606">1606</date>, John Bate, a Turkey merchant,
refused to pay a duty on currants that
had been arbitrarily imposed by <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, urging
that no one was bound to consent to a tax exacted without
the consent of Parliament. The judges of the Court of
Exchequer, before whom the matter was brought, decided in
favour of the king's right to raise export and import duties,
because they were levied, so they argued, not mainly to
get revenue, but by virtue of the king's undoubted right to
regulate trade. In <date value="1608">1608</date>, Salisbury became Lord High
Treasurer, and resolved to make a desperate effort to set the
king's finances straight. He took advantage of this decision
to issue a Book of lates which, without Parliamentary
authority, brought in a large number of increased customs
duties, known as the New Impositions, from which a revenue
of 70,000 a year was expected. So hard did the Treasurer
work, that he cut down the king's debt from a million to
three hundred thousand pounds. But he could not persuade
James to live soberly or cease lavishing his gold and
lands on his favourites. The result was that recourse was
again necessary to Parliament.
</p><p>  In  <date value="1610-02">Feb.1610</date>, Salisbury laid his demands before the
Commons, who answered him by drawing up a whole
catalogue of grievances. They complained of the New





   <pb id="p.191" n="191"/>

Impositions, of the abuses of feudal tenures, of the king's
mildness to Popish recusants, and of a law-book called
the Interpreter, the writer of which, Dr.
Cowell, taught that the king was above the
<note place="foot" n="20">    The Great Contract, <date value="1610">1610</date>, and the Breach between Kingand Commons<date value="1611">1611</date>.</note>
Parliament, and that " subsidies were granted
by Parliament in consideration of the king's
goodness inwaiving his absolute power to make
laws without their consent."  James threw
over Cowell, and Salisbury proposed an elaborate scheme
called the Great Contract, by which the king was to give up
the obsolete and vexatious feudal revenue in return for the
payment of his debts and a fixed addition of  200,000  a
year to his income.  But both parties haggled so long
about details, that no definite result could be arrived at.
At last James dissolved Parliament in Feb.
<date value="1611">1611</date> , and
angrily declared that he had not "a sincere patience,"
and would accept no supply " if they were to sauce it with
taunts and disgraces." To relieve his distress, he now
offered the new hereditary title of Baronet to all gentlemen
of position who would advance him &#x00A3;1080. Less than
a hundred persons were found to buy so cheap a dignity.
It is to James's credit that the sums thus lent were generally
paid back. A few years later, however, James sold two
peerages for &#x00A3;10,000 a piece.</p><p>
   In <date value="1614">1614</date>, want of
   money forced James to summon his
Second Parliament. Afraid of a repetition of his earlier
troubles, the king entered into negotiations
with a number of prominent members of the
<note place="foot" n="21">The Addled  Parliament,<date value="1614">1614</date>.</note>
former House of Commons, who advised him to make
concessions, and promised that if he did so, they would
strive to influence the elections in favour of ministerial
candidates, while they undertook to manage the House, and
persuade it to meet readily the royal necessities. From this
curious bargain these gentlemen were nicknamed the Undertakers.
But they entirely failed in their attempts, and public
opinion rose indignant that so narrow a clique should
venture to speak on behalf of the Commons of England.
Parliament repudiated its ancient leaders, and drew up a
long list of complaints, conspicuous among which were
the New Impositions.  Hot disputes at once arose, and
James became so irritated that he dissolved the Parliament
before a single act had been passed or any supply
granted. For this reason the wits called it the Addled
Parliament.</p><p>
   7. Weary of King James's weakness, Englishmen looked

with hope towards his children. James's eldest son, Henry,
<persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName></persName> (b. <date value="1594">1594</date>), already showed signs of taking
<note place="foot" n="23">TheRoyalFamily and Court. </note>
up a line of his own. He was a slow-minded,
 headstrong, but capable youth, fond of all
manly sports, and eager for renown as a soldier.  He was
passionately attached to his sister, the Lady <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
(b. <date value="1596">1596</date>), a bright, winning girl,
who, in <date value="1612">1612</date>, had married
Frederick V., Elector Palatine of the Rhine, the leader of
the South German Calvinists. This very popular match was
a great triumph for the Protestant party, and the crowning
work of Salisbury's political life. Before it could be completed, the Lord Treasurer died, worn out before his time
by the cares of State. Before the year was out, a sudden
attack of typhoid fever carried off Prince Henry, to the
universal sorrow of the nation.  His younger brother
Charles (b. <date value="1600">1600</date>) was made
<persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName></persName> in <date value="1616">1616</date>.
   </p><p>Salisbury had always had to contend against a Spanish

<note place="foot" n="24">The Favourites</note>

 Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton, and
Thomas, Earl of <placeName key="Suffolk">Suffolk</placeName>, the Lord Thomas Howard of the
Azores fleet in <date value="1591">1591</date> [see page 127]. The Howards now
hoped to succeed to Salisbury's power, and reverse his
policy. James had no faith in them, and preferred to be
his own minister, and rule directly with the help of clerks
and subordinates. "I would rather have a comfortable
man of ordinary parts," he used to say, "than the rarest
man in the world that will not be obedient."  But he
hated trouble, and wanted some one who would look after
details and serve his interests, but who was too ignorant
or insignificant to have a settled policy of his own. He
resolved, therefore, to take into his confidence some docile
youth who would amuse his leisure, act as his private
secretary, and save him from saying no to importunate
<note place="foot" n="25">Robert Carr.</note>
suitors. He chose for his purpose Robert Ker
or Carr (<dateRange from="1587" to="1645">1587-1645</dateRange>). Sprung from the fierce
Border family of the Kers of Ferniehurst, the favourite was
a "straight-limbed, well-favoured, strong-shouldered, and
smooth-faced fellow"; but his merits, however, did not
extend beyond his good looks, and his "rich and rare
parts," even in James's partial eyes, were "powdered and
mixed with strange streams of unquietness, passion, fury,
insolent pride, and settled obstinacy." Carr first attracted
James's notice in <date value="1607">1607</date>, when he broke his arm  at a
tilting match in the king's presence.  He soon became






 <pb id="p.193" n="193"/>

James's constant companion. In <date value="1609">1609</date>, he was enriched
by Raleigh's forfeited manor of Sherborne, though the
king had the grace to give Raleigh's family some sort of
compensation for their loss. In <date value="1611">1611</date>, he was made Viscount
Rochester, being the first Scotsman to take his seat
in the House of Lords. After <date value="1612">1612</date>, he became the allpowerful
favourite.</p><p>
   If James leant on Carr, Carr himself was so ignorant of
 his new part, that he depended very much on the advice of
 Sir Thomas Overbury, an ambitious and overbearing
 <note place="foot" n="26">Murder of Overbury and Fall of Somerset<dateRange from="1613" to="1616"> 1613-1616</dateRange>.</note>
  but high-minded man of letters. So
 little indeed could Carr do for himself, that                 ,
 he is said even to have got Overbury to write
 his love-letters for him to the Lady<placeName key="France">France</placeName>s Howard, the
 daughter of <placeName key="Suffolk">Suffolk</placeName>, but married in early childhood to
 Robert Devereux, <persName key="Earl of Essex">Earl of <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName></persName>, the son of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s
 favourite.  Lady <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> was violently in love with the
 handsome Scot, and sought to procure a divorce from
 her husband. Her kinsfolk, the Howards, supported her
 strongly, hoping that if she were free to marry Rochester,
 she would win him and the king over to the Catholic
 policy. In <date value="1613">1613</date>, through
 James's influence, the marriage
 of Lady <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> was declared invalid, but a new obstacle now
 presented itself to her union with the favourite. Overbury
 pleaded strongly against the match. Such was his hold
 over Rochester, that it was thought safest to get him
 out of the way.  He refused to go beyond sea as an
 ambassador, and, as a last resource, was shut up in the
 Tower for this disobedience to the king's commands.</p><p>
 Lady <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>, a woman without shame or scruple, was
 furious against Overbury, and resolved to take his life. She
 formed a regular plot with professional poisoners, who sent
 the prisoner tarts and jellies mixed with deadly drugs.
 Overbury soon fell sick, but still lingered despite the efforts
 of the gang. At last an apothecary's boy managed to kill
 him outright. His death was set down to natural causes, and
 in Dec. <date value="1613">1613</date>, Rochester, now made Earl of Somerset, was
 wedded to the murderess of his old comrade. For nearly two
 years the Howard faction triumphed. But their enemies, led
 by Archbishop Abbot, were ever on the watch, and Somerset
grew so insolent with power, that even James began to be
weary of his fits of temper. Yet his influence at court remained
considerable till the confession of the apothecary's
boy revealed to a horrified world the tragedy of Overbury's
death.  The whole hideous story was soon brought to







<pb id="p.194" n="194"/>   <note place="foot" n="27"><date value="1614">1614</date>-
-<date value="1617">1617</date> </note>
light. The instruments of the crime were tried, convicted,
and executed. Lady Somerset pleaded guilty before the
House of Lords, and was sentenced to death (<date value="1616">1616</date>). Somerset,
however, protested his ignorance, though adjudged by
his peers to be an accessory before the fact, and therefore
equally liable to the penalties of murder. James spared
the fallen pair their lives, and after seven years' imprisonment,
they were released from the Tower, and spent the
rest of their days in obscurity. Puritan England stood
aghast at the horrors which had been worked almost
in the presence of the sovereign. It was even whispered
that the king himself was closely implicated in the tale
of crime. But James was innocent of all save credulity,
weakness, and folly.</p><p>
  James soon found a new favourite in George Villiers
(<dateRange from="1592" to="1628">1592-1628</dateRange>), the younger son of a well-born but poor
<note place="foot" n="28">Rise of Buckingham, <dateRange from="1613" to="1617">1613-1617</dateRange>. </note>
Leicestershire knight, and a youth of " straight
and goodly stature,lovely complexion, andhand-
some features." Proud, high-spirited, good-humoured, quickwitted,
and gracious in his manner, Villiers was in every
way more attractive than the shallow, morose Border laird,
though he was badly educated, vain, fickle and arrogant.
His weak head was soon turned by his success, and, though
not dishonest, he often stooped to questionable courses.
James loved him like a son, and called him "Steenie,"
while Villiers addressed his sovereign as "dear dad and
gossip." Wealth, honours, titles, offices, were heaped upon
the fortunate young man. Created a peer in <date value="1616">1616</date>, he became
Earl of Buckingham in <date value="1617">1617</date>, and Duke in <date value="1623">1623</date>. He was
appointed Lord High Admiral with a charge to watch over
and improve the declining navy. The gravest churchmen
and the wisest councillors became humble suitors for his
favour. Laud attached himself closely to the giddy worldling,
hoping that his influence would win over the king from
his Calvinism and make him heartily support the struggling
Arminian cause. Bacon, slowly mounting the ladder of preferment
after his cousin's death, was profuse in tendering his
good advice. Bacon had at last won a good name at Court.
He had fought the battle of the prerogative in his long
<note place="foot" n="29">Bacon, Lord Chancellor, <date value="1618">1618</date>.</note>
contest with his old rival Coke, who was now
Lord Chief Justice, and struggling manfully
to uphold the majesty of the Common Law against the
subtle aggressions of the Crown. In <date value="1616">1616</date>, Coke was dismissed
from his office. In <date value="1617">1617</date>, Bacon was made Lord
Keeper of the Great Seal. He was soon raised to the






<pb id="p.195" n="195"/>

higher title of Lord Chancellor, and created Viscount St.
Albans. Foremost among the other advisers of the king
was the quick-witted Lionel Cranfield, who had started life
as a London apprentice, but had won favour at Court by his
zeal, activity, and knowledge of business, and was now
entrusted with the impossible task of setting James's finances
in order, as Lord High Treasurer and Earl of <placeName key="Middlesex">Middlesex</placeName>.
He was self-seeking and knew nothing of politics, but he
did some good in getting rid of abuses and maladministration.</p><p>
8. James's foreign policy still fluctuated wildly. His steady
object was to maintain peace and the balance of power,
and, in particular, to prevent religious wars.
He thought the best security for the peace of
<note place="foot" n="30">Foreign Policy.</note>
Europe was a hearty alliance between himself as the leader
of the Protestants and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> as the chief Catholic power.
One party at his Council, headed by the Howards, was altogether
in the pay of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. Another, led by the Puritan
Archbishop Abbot, sighed for a renewal of an aggressive
war against the great enemy of the Gospel.    English
public opinion inclined to this simple policy, which the
king was broad-minded enough to reject.   But James,
with all his honesty of purpose and all his statecraft,
often made himself the tool of the Spanish faction. Yet he
was shrewd enough to see both sides, though his deplorable
weakness in action led to the extraordinary result that he
was always trying to carry out two foreign policies at once.
 </p><p> Buckingham at first opposed the Howards' party, but was
gradually led to become friendly with <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> by the astute
Spanish ambassador Gondomar. In <date value="1616">1616</date>,
an old plan for
marrying Prince Charles to the Infanta Maria, daughter of
Philip III., was again taken up. Yet, at the same time,
king and Council eagerly accepted a rash proposal of
Raleigh quite incompatible with a Spanish alliance. This
was a scheme for a voyage, in quest of gold, to Guiana,
which Sir Walter had discovered in <date value="1595">1595</date>,
though it was
within the sphere which the Spaniards claimed as their
own, and in which they had established settlements.
</p><p>  9. More than twenty years had now passed since Raleigh
came back
from his first voyage to Guiana. Yet in his long solitude
in the Tower
the mind of the adventurer still teemed with plans for
revisiting the shores of the great river Orinoco, and
<note place="foot" n="31">Raleigh's last Voyage andDeath, <dateRange from="1617" to="1618">1617-1618</dateRange>.</note>
seeking out afresh the strange El Dorado, the city of
marvels and the home of fabulous wealth, where the
descendants of the Incas were still imagined to rule in
savage state, and







<pb id="p.196" n="196"/>
<note place="foot" n="32"> [<date value="1617">1617</date>--<date value="1620">1620</date></note>

were eager to share the treasures of their gold mines with the daring
Englishmen who would save them from Spanish tyranny. Raleigh
offered to lead an expedition to a mine far removed from Spanish settlements,
and was, in <date value="1616">1616</date>, released from the
Tower and allowed to fit out
a little fleet, though he was so poor that he could hardly furnish his
ships with provisions, and the adventure was so doubtful that tried
mariners shrunk from the risk.  In March
<date value="1617">1617</date>, Raleigh set sail
in the Destiny for the Spanish Main, having solemnly promised
that he would molest no Spaniards, but peacefully seek out the promised mine.
The voyage was long and difficult. Some of the ships
turned back, others were destroyed by tempests. Sickness raged
among the sailors, and when at last the remnant of ten ships cast
anchor in the mouth of the Orinoco, Raleigh himself was prostrate
with fever, and the dispirited crews had lost all hope of success. But
the high soul of the admiral rose superior to his troubles. " We can
make the adventure," he declared, " and if we perish, it shall be no
honour to England or gain to his Majesty to lose one hundred as valiant
gentlemen as England hath in it." He recked little of his promises,
and sought to kindle the cupidity of his followers by appeals to the old
buccaneer spirit. "There is no peace beyond the line," was his cry.
'If the mine fail, there is still the Mexican treasure fleet."
 </p><p> Raleigh remained at the mouth of the Orinoco, while his faithful lieutenant,
 Thomas Keymis, led five ships and 400 men up the river in quest
of the mine. For three weeks the little fleet struggled bravely up the
swift current of the mighty stream. But as they neared the place where
they believed they would find the mine, the new Spanish settlement of
San Thome blocked the upper reaches of the river. Keymis attacked
and burnt the little town after a sharp conflict, in which Raleigh's son
was slain. But the Spaniards still lurked in the thick woods, and
Keymis found that his prospects of further advance were very doubtful.
At last the seamen themselves would fight no longer, and Keymis was
forced to return to the admiral with tidings of hopeless failure. " You
have undone me by your obstinacy," was his stern reproof to his luckless
subordinate. Keymis went to his cabin and ran a dagger through
his heart. Raleigh prepared for further assaults on the Spaniards;
but the "rabble of idle rascals" (so he scornfully called his crews),
insisted on an immediate return to England. In June
<date value="1618">1618</date>, the
Destiny was back at Plymouth, and the admiral was at once arrested.
Gondomar demanded that he should be sent to take his trial in <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>
for piracy, and James was in no humour to uphold him any longer.
At last the king resolved that the easiest way to get out of his difficulty
would be to order Raleigh's execution under the old charges of treason
for which he had been convicted in <date value="1603">1603</date>.
On  <date value="1618-10-29">29 Oct.1618</date> the last
of the race of Drake and Gilbert fell under the headsman's axe,
showing the greatest courage and constancy on the scaffold. Protestant
England looked upon him as a hero, recking little of his violent
deeds, and believing that he was sacrificed to gratify the Popish
tyrant of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>.
 </p><p> 10. A great religious war now began to devastate <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>,
 and soon spread      over all central Europe.     In
<date value="1618">1618</date>, the Thirty Years' War
broke out with the revolt of
the Protestant nobles of Bohemia from their Catholic king






 <pb id="p.197" n="197"/>

the Emperor Mathias. Next year Mathias died, but the
Bohemians refused to recognise as their new king his cousin,
Ferdinand of Styria, a rigid Catholic, who was
now head of the German branch of the Austrian
<note place="foot" n="33"> The Bohemian Revolution<date value="1618">1618
</date> and the  Thirty Years'War,<dateRange from="1618" to="1648"> 1618-1648</dateRange></note>
house, and the Emperor Ferdinand II. They
chose instead Frederick, the Elector Palatine,
as their Protestant king, hoping that his
father-in-law, King James, and his other powerful kinsfolk,
would be ready to help him. Frederick was the leader of the
discontented Calvinists of Southern <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>, who had long
watched with dismay the progress of the Catholic Reaction
that was fast winning back their neighbours' lands to
Popery, and had long been eager to appeal to the sword.
They now declared in favour of Frederick's claims to
Bohemia. The war became a general struggle of the more
active German Protestants, who had united in the Evangelical
Union, and the Romanist princes who had formed
the Catholic League. But most of the Lutherans of the
North held aloof, leaving the brunt of the fighting to fall
on the Calvinists.</p><p>
  James was much perplexed by these new troubles. He
loved his daughter and her husband, but he hated war;
and, above all, an aggressive religious war. He studied the
constitution of Bohemia, but he could not persuade himself
that Frederick had any right to the throne. " The Palatine,"
said Buckingham, "is mounted on a high horse, but he
must be pulled off to listen to his father-in-law." This was
soon brought about, for, in <date value="1620">1620</date>,
Ferdinand won the battle of the White Hill, near Prague, and soon afterwards
drove Frederick out of Bohemia. English Protestant zeal
was warmly in favour of the spirited Elector. Volunteers
took up arms on his behalf, and even James became
indignant when a Spanish army occupied parts of the
Palatinate; for the same reasoning which led him not to
countenance the aggressions of Frederick led him to
heartily dislike the aggression of the Catholics on his son's
lawful dominions. He permitted the English volunteers,
under Sir Horace Vere, to garrison the fortresses of the
Elector, and prepared for war. But he had no money, and
still shirked strong measures.  By the end of
<date value="1622">1622</date>, the
Catholics had conquered the Palatinate, and its ruler was
a homeless fugitive.</p><p>
  11. James's great object was henceforth the restoration of
his son-in-law to his hereditary dominions. He now hoped
to carry this out by means of his Spanish alliance. But






<pb id="p.198" n="198"/>  <note place="foot" n="34"><date value="1620">1620</date>--<date value="1621">1621</date></note>

the long negotiations for the marriage of Prince Charles
to the Infanta had broken down in <date value="1618">1618</date>, on James at
<note place="foot" n="35">The Spanish Marriage,<dateRange from="1620" to="1624">1620-1624</dateRange>.</note>
last finding out that there was no chance of making the match, unless he was prepared to
 allow full freedom of worship to the Roman
Catholics. In <date value="1620">1620</date>, however, <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> again had need of
James, and Gondomar, who had left England after the
rupture of the negotiations, came back to renew his proposals
for a marriage treaty. James was now quite eager
for the scheme, believing that he could persuade the new
Spanish king, Philip IV. (who had succeeded his father ir.
<date value="1621">1621</date>) to use his influence on the Emperor to give up the
Palatinate and restore peace on the old conditions. <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>
was really playing her own game, and using James as a
tool. The religious difficulty protracted the negotiations,
and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> wished for the match chiefly because she hoped
to make England Roman Catholic, though she was also
anxious to prevent James from siding with the United Provinces,
with whom she was again at open war since <date value="1621">1621</date>.
</p><p>  In <date value="1622">1622</date>, John Digby, Earl of Bristol, the most far-seeing
English diplomatist of the age, was sent to Madrid to urge
the suit, but the negotiations still hung fire. Buckingham,
who ruled Charles as absolutely as he had ruled his
father James, persuaded the prince that the best way to
break through the diplomatic cobweb was to go to <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>
and woo the Infanta in person. In Feb. <date value="1623">1623</date>, Charles set
out on his chivalrous mission accompanied by Buckingham.
But the Infanta had resolved that she would wed no heretic,
and the Spanish Court set about converting Charles to the
Catholic religion. Charles, however, had been taught by
Laud to be a sound Protestant, and never wavered in his
faith.  The Spaniards now postponed completing  the
negotiations on the ground that the Pope had not yet
granted the dispensations necessary for the marriage.
Thus Charles was kept many months at Madrid waiting
for dispensations, which the king and his minister Olivarez
had secretly urged the Pope to refuse. Impatient at the
delay, Charles attempted to carry on his suit in person,
regardless of the stiff etiquette of the Spanish Court.
"The Infanta was in the orchard, and there being a
high partition wall between, the prince got on the top
of the wall and sprung down a great height, and so made
towards her; but she, spying him first of all the rest,
gave a shriek and ran back." Finally, Charles was told
that he might marry the Infanta if he liked, but that






  <pb id="p.199" n="199"/>

she must remain in <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, until he had actually got the
hoped-for freedom for the English Catholics. Charles now
saw that he was being tricked, and hurried back to
England, furious at the slight put upon him, and eager to
go to war to restore his sister to the Palatinate. Bristol
tried to keep open the negotiations, but was soon recalled
in disgrace.</p><p>
  12. Buckingham got the credit of the breach with <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>,
and for a short time he and the prince were really popular.
They now set their hopes on an alliance with
<note place="foot" n="36">The Breach with <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName><dateRange from="1624" to="1625">1624-1625</dateRange>.</note>
France, which was again strongly opposed         			           ,
to <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. It was agreed that Charles should
marry Henrietta Maria, the daughter of Henry IV. and the
sister of his successor, the young King Louis XIII.
(<dateRange from="1610" to="1643">1610-1643</dateRange>);
but a promise of favour to the recusants was contained
in the treaty that chilled the rising enthusiasm of
the English people.  Great preparations were made to
fight the Spaniards. An alliance with the Dutch was set
on foot. Subsidies were promised to James's brother-in-law,
Christian IV. of Denmark, who had undertaken to
support the distressed Protestant cause. Twelve thousand
soldiers were levied in England to serve under the Protestant
adventurer, Count Mansfeld, in an attempt to win back the
Palatinate.  But there was no order nor method in this
sudden burst of energy. Adequate supplies were still wanting,
and Mansfeld's troops, hurried up the Rhine in the cold
season in open boats and without provisions or shelter, died
off like flies, before reaching the seat of war. The French
proved but self-seeking allies, and all things remained in
confusion.</p><p>
  13. After the dismissal of the Addled Parliament, James
had got on as best he could for seven years without
Parliamentary grants or fresh law-making. His
<note place="foot" n="37"> The Last TwoParliaments of  Jame I.</note>
foreign troubles at last compelled him to have
recourse to Parliament. In <date value="1621">1621</date>,
a new Parliament assembled, eager to support the
Protestant cause in
<placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>, but profoundly distrustful of the king. James
asked for a large supply, " it being best," as he
<note place="foot" n="38">The Parliament of <date value="1621">1621</date>.</note>
said, "to treat of peace sword in hand." The
Commons, led by the former Chief Justice, Sir Edward Coke,
postponed voting money until all abuses had been investigated.
Monopolies had now become as pressing an evil as
in the later days of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, being granted very freely by
 <persName key="James I">James I</persName> in the hopes of encouraging trade, and often getting
turned from their proper purpose by the greed and dishonesty






<pb id="p.200" n="200"/>   <note place="foot" n="39"><date value="1621">1621</date>-
-<date value="1625">1625</date></note>

of the manufacturers. But James was not guilty, as the
Commons believed him to be, of a systematic plan for
robbing the nation by means of these monopolies, though
many of them were undoubted grievances.  Especially
bitter were the complaints against the monopoly for licensing
inns and regulating ale-houses, which the greedy monopolists,
led by Sir Giles Mompesson, had used so selfishly
that drunkenness and disorder were encouraged. The monopoly
for making gold and silver thread was also bitterly
denounced, though it was in intention an attempt to set
up by protection a new manufacture in England. The
Commons were furious. They sent Sir Francis Mitchell,
who had a large share in the ale house patent, to the Tower,
and drove Mompesson from the country. Buckingham
prudently threw over the monopolists.  James revoked
most of the patents, and the storm for a time was stilled.
 </p><p>  Lord Chancellor Bacon, a conspicuous friend of the monopolies,
 was next singled out for attack. Some aggrieved
<note place="foot" n="40">The Fall of Bacon </note>
suitors charged the Chancellor with receiving
bribes, though deciding the cases against the
 would-be corrupters. The Commons sent up the complaints
 to the Lords for investigation, thus practically, though not
 formally, reviving the old system of Impeachment, in which,
 as in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the Commons,
 as a grand jury of the nation, solemnly charged an offender
 before the House of Lords acting asjudges. Bacon scorned to
 defend himself. He protested that he had never given corrupt
 judgments, but he admitted that in accordance with the bad
 custom of the day, he had received presents from suitors,
 both before and after he had decided their cases. He was
 expelled from his office, fined, and imprisoned, though
 James released him almost at once from the Tower, and
 ultimately forgave him the fine. He remained henceforth in
 retirement, a disappointed and broken-spirited man,
 consoling his enforced leisure by working out part of the great
 plans of literature and philosophy, for which he had hitherto
 wanted leisure. He died in <date value="1626">1626</date>, "leaving his name and
 memory to men's charitable speeches, and to foreign nations
 and the next ages." The monopolists, Mompesson and
 Mitchell, were formally impeached and condemned in much
 the same way.
 </p><p>  Fairly good feeling had existed up to this point between
 king and Parliament. James had abandoned the
 monopolists and Bacon. The Commons voted a subsidy,
 and separated in June for the vacation, after making a





  <pb id="p.201" n="201"/>

solemn declaration in favour of the Elector Palatine,
"sounded forth with the voices of them all, lifting their
hats in their hands as high as they could hold them." In
November the Houses again assembled, only to hear that
James's diplomatic efforts had been fruitless, and that money
was required to defend the Palatinate. But they could not
see how James could be in earnest as the Protestant champion,
while he was still seeking in <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> for a Popish bride
for his heir. They, therefore, petitioned James to wed the
prince to a Protestant. James angrily ordered them not to
presume to offer advice on subjects on which it was not
asked. The Commons drew up a protest insisting that they
had the right to offer advice on any subject. James went
down to the House, tore out the protest from the Commons'
Journals, and soon afterwards dissolved the Parliament,
sending Coke and other leading members to the Tower.
  14. James's fourth and last Parliament met in
  <date value="1624">1624</date>, after
the failure of the Spanish marriage treaty. The Commons
were as eager as Buckingham and the prince
<note place="foot" n="41"> The Parliamentof <date value="1624">1624</date>.</note>
to fight the Spaniards, but the king desired a
land war in <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>, while the Commons were for a naval
war against <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. All parties agreed to impeach and
disgrace the Treasurer <placeName key="Middlesex">Middlesex</placeName>, nominally for corruption,
really for opposing the war. A declaratory act against monopolies
(that is, an act which maintained that they were
already illegal) was also passed. But even under the most
favourable conditions, the want of harmony of king and
Commons still made itself felt. On
<date value="1625-03-27">27 March 1625</date>, the old
king died of a fever, leaving everything unsettled.

crossbow. He looked noble on horseback and loved hunting
as much as his father. He was well educated and took a great
interest in theology. He was very attentive and devout
at prayer and sermons, and strongly attached to the Church
of England. He was also fond of music, painting, and
sculpture, having the Italian taste for ancient statues, and
making a good collection of pictures. He was temperate,
chaste, and serious, driving away from his Court the fools
and parasites that had delighted his father, and ever maintaining
his personal dignity. But his ability was not great.
Reserved, shy, and cold, he wanted sympathy, insight, and
imagination. He was slow of speech and never cured himself
of a slight stammer. He neither thought nor expressed
himself clearly, and lived constantly in a dream world of
his own. He was wanting in directness, straightforwardness,
and force, and was both vacillating and incurably
obstinate. He understood the temper of his subjects even
less than his father, and was quite unfit to act as king in a
troubled time of transition. He boasted that he could not
"defend a bad nor yield in a good cause," and, conscious
that he meant well himself, he always regarded his enemies
as influenced by the worst motives.  He was seldom
straightforward, and his thoughts were so confused that he
could never be tied down by any promise or fixed to any
course of policy. He developed a hopeless habit of
prevarication, and no trust could be placed in his word. He
was completely ruled by Buckingham, in whom he had an
unbounded confidence. In May <date value="1625">1625</date> he married Henrietta
Maria, the youngest daughter of Henry IV. Queen
Mary was a quick-witted girl of fifteen, " nimble and quick,
black-eyed, brown-haired, and in a word a brave lady."
But she was frivolous, light, and pleasure-loving, and soon
developed a taste for underhand intrigue that did her
husband's cause much harm.</p><p>
  2. The foreign policy of the new reign was already
marked out for it. Charles still earnestly desired to restore
<note place="foot" n="3">Foreign Policy,<dateRange from="1625" to="1629">1625-1629</dateRange>.</note>
his brother-in-law, the Elector Palatine, and
 to be avenged of the affronts put upon him by
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. For the former object he required an alliance with
the German Protestants, who now continued the Thirty
  Years' War with the help of Christian of
<note place="foot" n="4">Danish Period ofthe Thirty Years War,<dateRange from="1625" to="1629"> 1625-1629</dateRange>. </note>
Denmark, Charles's uncle. With this purpose
 Buckingham went to the Hague and made a
treaty with Denmark and the United Provinces, by which
large subsidies were again promised to the Danes. Charles






 <pb id="p.203" n="203"/>

had no funds, and, despite the treaty, sent but scanty help
in men or money to King Christian, who in
<date value="1626">1626</date> was entirely defeated by the Catholics at the Battle of Lutter, and
was forced to give up the struggle in
<date value="1629">1629</date> by the Peace of
Liibeck, in which he abandoned northern <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName> to the
Emperor and the Catholic League. Thus the cause of
the Elector Palatine was for a time hopelessly lost, and the
outlook looked black for the German Protestants.</p><p>
  The second main object of Charles's policy, the attack on
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, involved a close alliance with<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, where the
ideas of the brilliant Cardinal Richelieu were
already obtaining an ascendency over the
<note place="foot" n="5">Alliance with<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, <date value="1625">1625</date>.</note>
sluggish mind of Louis XIII. Richelieu wished to carry
on Henry IV.'s policy, and make<placeName key="France">France</placeName> a strong despotic
but national state at home, and break down the power of
the Austro-Spanish house abroad. He therefore welcomed
the alliance with the English, the Dutch, and the German
Protestants. But the Huguenots, the French Calvinists, had
obtained by the Edict of Nantes not only religious toleration,
but political powers that made them dangerous to the
French monarchy. They were constantly in rebellion, and
were in close union with the discontented nobles. Before
the Crown could become really supreme, before<placeName key="France">France</placeName> could
safely join in a great European war, Richelieu thought that
it was necessary to put down their rebellion, and destroy
their political power. Anxious to get French help against
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> as soon as possible, Charles foolishly lent Louis XIII.
some English ships, though knowing that they might be
used to coerce the Huguenot stronghold of La Rochelle.
But the crews deserted in a body, and only a single English
seaman consented to serve a foreign and Popish master.
  </p><p>In <date value="1625">1625</date>
  Charles sent Sir Edward Cecil (afterwards
Lord Wimbledon), a grandson of the first Lord Burghley,
and a nephew of Robert Cecil, with a land and
<note place="foot" n="6"> The Spanish War and the CadizVoyage, <date value="1625">1625</date></note>
sea force against Cadiz, hoping that he would
cut off the yearly treasure fleet on its way
from America to <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. The men were raw levies, ill paid
and mutinous, and the ships largely merchantmen pressed
into the service. The soldiers landed near Cadiz, and drank
themselves dead drunk with a store of wine that they
discovered. They returned to the ships without venturing
to face the enemy, and at once set sail. The Spanish
treasure fleet now got safely into Cadiz, whereupon Cecil
returned to England. The boasted revival of the exploits
of the Elizabethan heroes ended in a lamentable failure.







<pb id="p.204" n="204"/>      <note place="foot" n="7"><date value="1626">1626</date>--<date value="1628">1628</date> </note>

Want of funds prevented any further serious attacks on
the Spaniards.</p><p>
  The good understanding with<placeName key="France">France</placeName> soon came to an end.
When Charles married his French wife, he had rashly
promised<note place="foot" n="8">Breach with<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, <date value="1626">1626</date>.   	</note>
 to deal gently with the Popish recusants,
though the strong Protestant zeal of his Parliaments
made it quite impossible for him to alter the law in
their favour. The French complained that Charles had
broken his word. They also resented Charles's action in
driving Queen Mary's French attendants out of the country,
because they incited her to quarrel with her husband and
dislike English ways. Moreover, Richelieu had given up
hopes of immediately taking part in the German war, and
had turned his main energies towards crushing the Huguenots.
Violently changing his policy, Charles took up the
cause of the French Protestants, and resolved to defend La
Rochelle, which was now threatened with a siege by
Richelieu. In July <date value="1627">1627</date> Buckingham sailed with a great fleet
to its relief. He landed on the island of Rhe, not far off

<note place="foot" n="9">Expedition to Rhe, <date value="1627">1627</date>.</note>
from the beleaguered town, but he failed to
 capture the fort of St. Martin, the chief town
of the little island. His badly fed and disorderly troops
could not endure the long and fatiguing campaign. After
the French had poured reinforcements into Rhe, the rash
and inexperienced commander was forced to abandon his
positions. He got back to England in November, having
lost nearly 4000 men.  Next year another fleet was despatched,
after Buckingham's death, under the Earl of
Lindsay, but it failed to break through the strong moles and
palisades which barred the approach to La Rochelle harbour,
and was forced to return. The Protestant capital was
<note place="foot" n="10">Fall of La Rochelle, <date value="1628">1628</date></note>    								        now forced to surrender, and Charles lost his
last hope when the civil war in<placeName key="France">France</placeName> was
thus brought to an end by the utter defeat of the Huguenots
and the destruction of their political power.  The
king's pretentious foreign policy had been a hopeless
failure. A vigorous policy abroad implied union at home,
and every movement of Charles was hindered by the hostility
of his Parliaments.</p><p>
  3. The struggle of king and Parliament became more
embittered than ever with the new reign. Things were
<note place="foot" n="11">The Parliament of <date value="1625">1625</date>.</note>
rapidly getting to a deadlock from which
there was no escape save by the triumph of
either the one or the other. In June <date value="1625">1625</date> Charles's First
Parliament assembled, but, despite the king's urgent appeals



 <pb id="p.205" n="205"/>

for money to enable him to carry out his Protestant foreign
policy, the Commons would only grant two subsidies (about
L140,000), and proposed to renew for one year only the
customs duties called Tonnage and Poundage, which since
Henry IV.'s time had always been given to the king for
life. The plague was now raging in the narrow streets and
foul alleys of London, and the session for safety's sake
was transferred to Oxford.  There the Commons renewed
their complaints. They were indignant that Papists were
let off lightly and bad Protestants received with favour.
They declared that they had no sympathy with Charles's
risky and enterprising foreign schemes, and finally pointed
to Buckingham as the real source of troubles. " It is not
fit," declared Phelips, the outspoken leader of the Commons,
"to repose the safety of the kingdom upon those
that have not parts answerable to their places." Charles
dissolved the Parliament in anger to save a formal attack
on his favourite. He thought, and with good reason, that
the Commons had played him false in refusing to support
the war which their predecessors had advocated.
Their best answer was that they could not make lavish
grants until the ministry had their confidence. But such a
plea took away from the king his hitherto undisputed right
of ruling the country as he thought fit. The claims of the
Commons went back to the days when Henry IV.'s Council
was nominated in Parliament, and anticipated the modern
cabinet system, which a century later resulted from the
triumph of the Parliament. It could hardly be expected
that Charles would give up his power without a struggle.
His stiffness and pride even made it impossible for him to
lessen the hostility of Parliament by partial concessions.
He thought both his interests and his honour were involved
in upholding Buckingham against his people.
 </p><p>  Though Charles had dismissed one Parliament, his finan-
 cial necessities at once compelled him to summon another
 one. The Second Parliament of Charles met
 <note place="foot" n="12">The Parliamentof <date value="1626">1626</date>.</note>
 in February <date value="1626">1626</date>, after
 the failure of the Cadiz
 expedition had brought home to wise men the folly of
 <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>n going to war when out of the confidence of the
 bearers of the nation's purse. The plain-speaking leaders of
 the previous Parliament were made sheriffs to keep them out
 of the House, but a new leader was found in Sir John Eliot,
 a fervid, high-minded, and eloquent young Cornish squire,
 who had hitherto been an enthusiastic friend of Buckingham
 on personal grounds, but had at last lost all confidence






<pb id="p.206" n="206"/>     <note place="foot" n="13"><date value="1626">1626</date>--<date value="1628">1628</date></note>

in his former idol. Eliot compared Buckingham to Sejanus,
the wicked favourite of the Roman Emperior Tiberius, and
easily induced the Commons to impeach him before the
Lords, though many of the charges now brought against
him were untrue or exaggerated. Charles made matters
worse by a foolish attempt to keep Bristol, Buckingham's
enemy, out of the House of Lords, and by throwing Eliot
into prison while Parliament was still sitting. Succeeding
in neither of these measures, he dissolved Parliament in
June, protesting that he would allow the Commons freedom
to offer counsel, but no liberty of controlling his government.
 </p><p> 4. The breach with<placeName key="France">France</placeName> now followed, and Charles
was obliged to provide money for the expedition to Rhe by
levying aforced loan. The legality of such an
impost was very doubtful, for it was agreed that
 <note place="foot" n="14">The General Loan and Darnell's Case,<dateRange from="1626" to="1627">1626-1627</dateRange>.</note>
regular taxes could only be levied after Parliamentary grant,
and an Act of Richard III. prohibited even a benevolence, that is, a compulsory gift to the
king. But the Crown lawyers argued that, despite the statute
against benevolences, there was no law that forbade the king
from borrowing his subjects' money. All sorts of oppressive
means were taken to enforce the loan, such as billeting
soldiers on the obstinate, enforcing martial law on peaceful
citizens, and shutting up the incurably intractable in prison.
Among this last class were Eliot and most of the leaders
of the Commons.   To test the lawfulness of Charles's
action five of the prisoners, Sir Thomas Darnell, Sir
John Corbet, Sir Walter Erle, Sir John Heveningham,
and Sir Edward Hampden obtained a writ of habeas corpus
from the King's Bench. By this writ every gaoler was
compelled to produce in court the body of any captive
entrusted to his charge, and to specify the offence for which
he had been committed, so that if the prisoner were detained
unlawfully the judges could order his release. In this case
the gaoler returned to the writ that the five knights were
kept in custody by the special command of the king. The
five knights' lawyers urged that they should be tried or
let out on bail, as Magna Carta denied such power to
the Crown, while the king's attorney showed that such
commitments had been very usual. The timid and perplexed
judges sent the five knights back to prison, thus
practically deciding in the king's favour, but they shirked
declaring the general principle that the king could imprison
his subjects at his discretion. A little later Charles set the
five captives free. He had at length realised that his only






    <pb id="p.207" n="207"/>

hope of relieving La Rochelle was by summoning another
Parliament.</p><p>
  5. Charles's Third Parliament met on
  <date value="1628-03-17">I7th March1628</date>.
Sir Thomas Wentworth, member for <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName>, became
spokesman of the prevailing discontent.
Wentworth was anxious to uphold the king's authority,
<note place="foot" n="15">The Parliament of <dateRange from="1628" to="1629">1628-1629</dateRange>.</note>
 but he had no confidence in Buckingham, and wished
to drive him from power. He now made an effort to
mediate between the king and Commons. It was maintained
in Parliament that Charles had no legal right to
send men to prison without trial or bail, or to raise loans
or to billet soldiers on householders.  Wentworth contented
himself with bringing forward a bill which abolished
for the future the powers claimed by the king in these
matters. But Charles would not give up the power of
imprisonment, though willing, as he said, "to maintain all
his subjects in the just freedom of their persons and safety
of their estates." Wentworth now stepped aside, and was
succeeded by more thoroughgoing opponents of the crown,
such as Eliot, Coke, John Pym, and the famous antiquary
and lawyer John Selden, " the chief of learned men reputed
in this land." Coke now proposed that Wentworth's bill
should be restated in a more drastic form, and that
in addition all martial law should be declared illegal. He brought
forward the Petition of Right.</p><p>

  <quote rend="blockquote">This was a declaratory act, reciting that
  the rights claimed by
Charles were already illegal by old statutes, and especially Magna
Carta and the so-called statute de tallagio non concedendo

 (really the Confirmatio Cartarum of
 <date value="1297">1297</date>). It therefore denounced as unlawful:
 i. The levying of
gifts, loans, benevolences, or taxes without consent of Parliament.
2. The imprisonment of persons without any cause shown. 3. The
billeting of soldiers and sailors on householders against their wills.
4. The issuing of commissions of martial law.</quote>
 </p><p>  The Petition easily passed the Commons, and, after some
 debate, was accepted by the Lords. Charles did not venture
 openly to reject it, but sent back a long and evasive
 answer that meant nothing. The House was indignant.
 Selden moved that Buckingham's impeachment should be
 renewed. The Lords pressed the king for a clear reply.
 At last, on 7th June, Charles gave the royal assent to the
 Petition. It was a great victory for the Commons, for the
 Petition of Right was worthy to be put beside Magna Carta
 itself as a landmark in the history of English liberty. In
 their gratitude they voted Charles five subsidies (about





<pb id="p.208" n="208"/>      <note place="foot" n="17"> <date value="1628">1628</date>--<date value="1629">1629</date></note>

&#x00A3;350,000), but within a few days new disputes arose. The
Commons impeached the Arminian clergyman Dr. Main-waring, and renewed their attack on Buckingham. The
king had levied Tonnage and Poundage since his accession
without any parliamentary grant. This the Commons now
declared to be a breach of the Petition of Right. Charles,
in disgust, prorogued Parliament.
</p><p>  In  <date value="1629-01">Jan.1629</date>, Parliament again assembled, and busied
itself with calling some of the Arminian clergy to account
<note place="foot" n="18">Tonnage and Poundage, <date value="1629">1629</date>. </note>
for having brought back Popish ceremonies to
 the churches. It then again took up the question
 of Tonnage and Poundage. Charles had seized the goods of a merchant named Rolle, who was a member of
the House of Commons, on account of his refusal to pay the
hated tax. John Pym wished to raise the whole question
of the legality of the imposition. But the Commons, on
Eliot's motion, took a narrower ground, and declared that
the attack on Rolle was a breach of the privilege of Parliament.
Charles would not allow the custom-house officers
to answer for their conduct before the House. The dispute
waxed hotter than ever. A short adjournment did not
turn the Commons from their purpose. On 2nd March,
the Speaker Finch announced that the king decreed that
the House should adjourn.  A great shout of "No !
arose. Eliot rose to speak, and, as Finch was leaving the
chair, two stout members, Denzil Holles and Benjamin
Valentine, held him down struggling in his chair, while
Eliot moved three resolutions, branding as enemies of the
kingdom those who brought in innovations in religion or
advised the levying of Tonnage and Poundage without a
Parliamentary grant, or voluntarily paid those duties. A
scene of wild confusion followed. Hot and reckless speeches
were uttered. The doors were locked, though an usher was
knocking at them with a message from the king. The
Speaker refused to put Eliot's resolutions. At last Holles
put them himself, and loud shouts of "Aye !" declared them
carried. The Commons then streamed out to hear their prorogation.
On 10th March Parliament was dissolved, and
for eleven years no new one was summoned.
</p><p>  Eliot, Holles, and Valentine were brought before the
King's Bench charged with riot and sedition. They refused
to plead before an inferior tribunal, claiming
<note place="foot" n="19">Imprisonmentand Death of Eliot, <dateRange from="1629" to="1632">1629-1632</dateRange>.</note>
their privilege as members of the High Court
 of Parliament. But the judges laid down that
as riot and sedition were offences, and as there was no



   <pb id="p.209" n="209"/>

Parliament any longer in existence which could punish them,
their own court had jurisdiction in the case. The accused
still refused to plead, and were sent to the Tower, where, in
<date value="1632">1632</date>, Eliot died of consumption.
Charles vindictively refused him a grave among his
ancestors at Port Eliot.</p><p>
   6. Between the first and second session of Charles's third
 Parliament, Buckingham had been murdered. The popular
 cry against him had risen higher and higher.
 <note place="foot" n="20"> Murder of   Buckingham,<date value="1628">1628</date>.</note>
 Ballads were sung in the street denouncing
 him as a monster of crime and folly. A quack-doctor, named Lambe, was brutally murdered by a mob of
 London apprentices, for no other crime than his intimacy
 with the favourite. Buckingham's friends exhorted him to
 wear a shirt of mail under his clothes, but he refused,
 saying, "there are no Roman spirits left." In August <date value="1628">1628</date>,
 he went down to Portsmouth to hasten the preparations for
 the new expedition to relieve La Rochelle. On 23rd August,
 he was struck down by the knife of a fanatic named Felton.
 The crime was the result of private spite, not of political
 animosity. Felton had served as a lieutenant in the
 expedition to Rhe, and had been refused promotion and denied
 his pay by the duke. But he became a hero in the eyes of
 the mob.  When he was hurried off to the Tower, the
 crowd shouted, "God bless thee, little David! The Lord
 comfort thee !" A minister wrote an eulogistic poem on the
 murderer-
       <quote rend="blockquote"> "Let the Duke's name solace and crown thy thrall,
        All we for him did suffer-thou for all;
        And I dare boldly write, as thou darest die,
        Stout Felton, England's ransom he doth lie."</quote>
Felton was hanged at Tyburn: Buckingham's body was
buried " in as poor and confused manner as hath been
seen at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, an armed guard protecting the slain
tyrant's corpse from the insults of the mob." Charles called
him a martyr, and bitterly regretted his loss. Henceforth,
the king was his own minister, and Buckingham's removal,
instead of improving the relations between king and people,
took away the last barrier between Charles and the indignation
of his subjects.</p><p>
  7. A new epoch in Charles's reign begins with <date value="1629">1629</date>.
On the one hand the king was deprived of the support of
Buckingham, while on the other, the last stormy session
of his third Parliament had shown conclusively that king
and Commons could no longer live side by side on the
old terms. Charles's claim to rule the country as he liked







<pb id="p.210" n="210"/>    <note place="foot" n="21"><date value="1629">1629</date>--<date value="1634">1634</date></note>

was now answered by the counter claim of Parliament to
withhold supplies, if his ministers or policy were not to
their liking. This meant that the Commons
practically claimed supremacy in the state,
<note place="foot" n="22">The Period of  Arbitrary Rule
<dateRange from="1629" to="1640">1629-1640</dateRange>.Beginnings of the Revolution  </note>
for, though they professed to respect the
 king's ancient and undoubted prerogatives,
yet they insisted that whenever there was a
difference of opinion between them and the monarch,
Charles should give way to the representatives of the nation.
Despite their constant protest that they claimed nothing
but the time-honoured liberties of the people, this was really
a new and revolutionary pretension. Charles had, therefore,
a good deal to say for himself. He too, like the Commons,
could point to a long series of precedents in his favour.
He too, like the Commons, could honestly protest that he
desired to uphold the ancient constitution, and abhorred
all innovation. His case was in a way stronger than that
of the Commons. While he only attacked details, the
  Commons were really striving to change the spirit of the
  whole system. However, the profession of both parties, that
  they were but looking back on an ideal past, shirked the real
  question, which was what was best for the future. What
  neither king nor Commons could see was, that the nation
  had outgrown the traditional institutions of the country,
  and that new necessities required a new adjustment of
  power.  There were only two issues possible.  Either
  Charles must make himself what Richelieu had made
  Louis XIII., an absolute king; or Parliament must make
  itself the strongest thing in the state and the ultimate
  source of power. Both parties still refused to realise what
  lay before them. In the eleven years of personal government
  which now followed, Charles still professed to be
  ruling as a constitutional and lawful king in the spirit of
  the Tudors. But this attempt led him to a series of mean
  tricks and quibbles, almost worse than an open defiance
  of the law. He never learned, with all his experience, that
  he could never hope to succeed as long as he continued to
  set his interests on one side and those of the nation on the
  other. Even Louis XIII. owed his power to being at
  bottom the head and representative of the French nation.
  Charles never tried to formulate a policy, or to form a
  national royalist party. He never even set on his side the
  growing love of old ways in the Church and the sturdy
  English love of individual liberty, which were beginning to
  resent the Puritan narrowness and the religious intolerance





  <pb id="p.211" n="211"/>

of the Commons. Charles fought for his own hand alone,
and with incurable blindness and obstinacy plunged headlong
into the courses which finally brought about his ruin.
 </p><p> 8. Charles was henceforward his own prime minister,
his dull, suspicious nature admitting no one to his full and
complete confidence. His rule of eleven years
<note place="foot" n="23">Treasurer Weston andthe Finances,<dateRange from="1629" to="1635">1629-1635</dateRange></note>
was a long catalogue of failure.  His first
difficulty was to make the revenue balance
his expenses, now that all hope of Parlia-              		     .
mentary aid was gone. For this he trusted largely to Lord
Treasurer Weston, who, in <date value="1634">1634</date>,
became Earl of Portland.
Weston was a man of "imperious nature, yet always in a
terrible fright and apprehension, a man of big looks and
mean and abject spirit." Despite the action of Parliament
in <date value="1629">1629</date>, he continued to levy
Tonnage and Poundage.
He revived an old law that inflicted heavy fines on all
gentlemen who held by military service an estate of
land worth &#x00A3;40 a year and had neglected to get themselves
dubbed knights. He evaded the Monopolies Act
of <date value="1624">1624</date> by setting up a
Soap Company, to which he
gave the exclusive right of selling soap, as corporations
were excluded from   the operation of the Act.   By
prudence and economy the Treasurer restored some sort
of order to the finances, and his general policy of letting
things alone prevented great discontent among the people.
After his death, in <date value="1635">1635</date>, his
pettifogging system of reviving
obsolete legal claims for the sake of a paltry benefit to
the exchequer was pushed forward more boldly.  Fresh
customs duties were imposed and fresh monopolist corporations
set up. Commissioners were ordered to examine the
limits of the royal forests, and inflict heavy fines on those
who had encroached upon them. Yet all these devices did
not give Charles an adequate revenue, while they made the
king and his policy more and more odious to the people.</p><p>
  9. Among the many expedients employed for increasing
the revenue the most famous was a plan, first suggested in
<date value="1634">1634</date>, by the Attorney-General Noy, that the

<note place="foot" n="24"> ShipMoney, <date value="1634">1634</date>.</note>
provide the king with ships, or in their place to pay a money
composition called Ship Money, with which the king might
build ships for himself.  There were plenty of ancient
precedents for such an imposition, and Charles had an
urgent need of increasing the royal navy to carry out his
schemes of foreign policy, and asserting his claim to the
sovereignty of the seas. The sums levied were generally







<pb id="p.212" n="212"/>      <note place="foot" n="25"> <date value="1635">1635</date>--<date value="1648">1648</date></note>

paid, and in <date value="1635">1635</date> inland as
well as maritime districts were
required to contribute Ship Money. Though Charles contended
that it was merely a money composition in lieu of
an ancient obligation to build ships to defend the realm, it
became practically a new tax, levied without any Parliamentary
authority in the very teeth of the Petition of Right.
</p><p>  Among the writs for Ship Money issued in
  <date value="1635">1635</date> was
one directed to the Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, ordering
him to raise &#x00A3;4500 from his county, being the
  cost of a ship of 450 tons.  Payment was
 <note place="foot" n="26">Hampden' resistance toShip Money,<dateRange from="1635" to="1638">1635-1638</dateRange>.</note>
 resisted by John Hampden (<dateRange from="1594" to="1643">1594-1643</dateRange>), the
wealthy and well-born squire of Great Hampden in
the same county, a man already conspicuous as a
steady opponent of the royal pretensions both in his own
neighbourhood and in the House of Commons, the close
friend of the martyred Eliot, and a gentleman of culture,
learning, high principle, ability, and refinement. His
opposition to Ship Money made him a popular hero. But it
availed little for the present.  In <date value="1638">1638</date>, a majority of the
judges issued their decision that the new exaction was a
lawful tax. Of the twelve judges who sat in the Exchequer
Chamber, seven delivered their judgment in favour of Ship
Money. But five judges declared (two for technical reasons)
in favour of Hampden.     "This decision proved of more
advantage to the gentleman condemned than to the king's
service," for the grounds and reasons left no man anything
that he could call his own.   For the future Ship Money
was paid with extreme unwillingness.      Sluggish public
opinion at length grew disgusted with Charles's mean and
pitiful financial policy.</p><p>
   10. Despite the ingenuity of Portland and the lawyers, Charles
 remained so poor that he despaired of carrying on the spirited foreign
 policy which he had upheld since <date value="1624">1624</date>. The dissolutiom
 <note place="foot" n="27"> Foreign Policy,<dateRange from="1629" to="1648"> 1629-1648</dateRange>.</note>     											          tion of <date value="1629">1629</date> left him still at war both with<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. It was a critical moment in the history of
 Protestantism. Flushed with his triumph over Christian of Denmark,
 the Emperor Ferdinand had issued in <date value="1629">1629</date> his Edict of Restitution,
 demanding the surrender to the Roman Church of the ecclesiastical
 possessions that since the Reformation had been in the hands of the
 German Protestants.  Despite their unwillingness to fight, the
 Lutherans of the North were now forced to take up arms to resist the
 threatened attack on their religion and possessions. Charles was
 compelled to hold aloof from the great struggle. In
 <note place="foot" n="28">Peace with<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and  <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, <dateRange from="1629" to="1630">1629-1630.</dateRange>  </note>         													<date value="1629">1629</date> he patched up peace with<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, which now
  again under Richelieu's guidance was preparing to
 help the German Protestants.  In <date value="1630">1630</date> Charles
 was forced to make peace with <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> as well, thus practically






       <pb id="p.213" n="213"/>

abandoning his brother-in-law's hereditary dominions to their fate.
Henceforward Charles watched with the utmost interest the progress
of the great struggle in <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>, striving by negotiations and
remonstrances to secure the restoration of the Elector Palatine, but
mortified to find that no one listened to the appeals of a king without
resources to enforce his wishes by the sword.</p><p>
  In <date value="1630">1630</date> Gustavus Adolphus,
 the hero king of Sweden, took up the
Protestant cause when Protestantism in <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName> was threatened with
extinction. Within two years he had secured a magnificent
triumph; but his death in <date value="1632">1632</date> again made
<note place="foot" n="29"> The Thirty the Years' War, Swedish Period,<dateRange from="1630" to="1634">1630-1634</dateRange>.</note>
balance more doubtful. Frederick of the Palatinate,
whom Gustavus had brought back to Heidelberg, died
about the same time, and his widow and family were soon again
homeless wanderers. Charles treated them with great kindness, sending
what money he could to help his sister, and bringing up her three
sons, Charles, Rupert, and Maurice at the English Court. After
<date value="1634">1634</date> Richelieu at last openly entered
upon the war, which went on its
weary course until <date value="1648">1648</date>, when the
Treaties of Westphalia restored the
old balance between the religious confessions of <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>, but only at the price of the hopeless break-up
<note place="foot" n="30"> French Period,<dateRange from="1634" to="1648">1634-1648</dateRange></note>
of German unity and the transference of some of the
fairest of German territories to the dominion of the foreigner. The
preponderance of<placeName key="France">France</placeName> was established on the ruin of <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>, and
her new monarch, Louis XIV. (<dateRange from="1643" to="1715">
1643-1715</dateRange>), and his shrewd minister the
Italian Cardinal Mazarin, were enabled to carry out the work begun
by Richelieu for the sluggish Louis XIII. One result of the treaty
was that Frederick's son Charles got back part of his Electorate.
  11. Religion occupied the foremost place in the minds of</p><p>
Englishmen of the seventeenth century.   The strife of the
two great religious parties into which England
<note place="foot" n="31">Puritans and Arminians.</note>
was now divided complicated and obscured
the plain and simple issue between Charles and his Parliaments.    Side by side with the political revival of the
claims of Parliament there had grown up a strong religious
reaction from the dominant Calvinism of the previous
generation. The House of Commons had identified itself
with the Calvinists.  Charles made a close alliance with
the Arminians, and sought to both strengthen his power
and carry out the religious ideas he thought best by favouring as much as he could the extension of their views.
Alarmed at the fierce intolerance of the Commons, the
Arminian clergy were forced to make common cause with
the crown.</p><p>
  William Laud (<dateRange from="1573" to="1645">1573-1645</dateRange>),
  a Reading clothier's son, had
from the first been the great adviser of Charles in Church
matters. He had in early life fought against
Calvinism at Oxford, where he became President<note place="foot" n="32">Laud's Enforcement of Conformity,<dateRange from="1633" to="1640">1633-1640</dateRange>.</note>
 of St. John's College, and was famous for
his theological and Oriental learning. He had attached himself







<pb id="p.214" n="214"/>   <note place="foot" n="33"> [<date value="1625">1625</date>--<date value="1633">1633</date></note>

 closely to the fortunes of Buckingham, and was made
in <date value="1621">1621</date> Bishop of
St. David's. King James had grave misgivings
in promoting him.  "He hath," said the shrewd
old king, "a restless spirit which cannot see when things
are well, but loves to toss and change and bring matters to
a pitch of reformation floating in his own brain."  But
Laud won great fame by his conference with the Jesuit
Fisher, by which he confirmed Buckingham and
Buckingham's mother in the Protestant faith. He was soon removed
from his remote Welsh see to the bishopric of Bath and
Wells. In <date value="1628">1628</date> he became
Bishop of London, and in
<date value="1633">1633</date> succeeded Abbot
(whose power had long been on
the wane) as Archbishop of Canterbury. He was a man
of clear head, extraordinary command over details, and
unbounded activity; pushing, zealous, and indefatigable.
Though thoroughly religious and high minded, he had a
trace of pettiness and bigotry withal, and, like Charles
himself, lived too much in an ideal world of his own for him
to understand the temper of other people. He worked with
unwearied activity towards reforming the lax discipline of the
Church, hunting out abuses, depriving the scandalous clergy
of their livings, and striving to elevate the religious life
of the whole nation. More broad and tolerant than the
Puritans in his dislike of controversy about doctrines, and
in his sympathy for men who differed in some ways
from his views, he desired to bring the Church of England
together by maintaining a rigid unity of ceremonies.
"I laboured, nothing more," he himself said, "than that
the external public worship of God-too much slighted
in most parts of this kingdom - might be preserved,
and that with as much decency and uniformity as might
be, being still of opinion that unity cannot long continue
in the Church when uniformity is shut out of the Church
door." Mainly for this object he revived the old custom
of holding a metropolitical visitation of the whole of
the Province of Canterbury (<dateRange from="1633" to="1636">
1633-1636</dateRange>). He forced the
afternoon lecturers (set up in many churches as advocates
of Calvinism) to wear surplices and read the Common
Prayer before preaching. He removed the altars, which
since <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s time had been movable tables in the
middle of the church, and fixed them to the east end, railed
off from the rest of the church, and taught the people to bow
to them on entering the building. He forced the congregations
of foreign Protestants to use the Prayer Book. He
revived King James's Declaration of Sports, permitting the






   <pb id="p.215" n="215"/>

people to enjoy "lawful games" (such as archery and
dancing) after service on Sunday. He reformed the Church
Courts and sought to bring every offence against morals
before them. Clergy and laity alike felt the weight of his hand.
He worked much good, but also much evil; for his Church
Courts were an intolerable tyranny, and by identifying the
cause of the Church with the cause of Charles, he heaped
up hatred for himself and nearly wrecked the Church altogether.
His system of " Thorough " allowed no place for
Puritanism within the Church and no toleration for it
outside it. The first few years of Charles's personal government
had passed away without any general outburst of
feeling against it, Before long Laud's tactless activity excited
the fiercest opposition.  But for the present the
Court of High Commission, the mouthpiece of the king's
supremacy over the Church, was ready at Laud's service
to crush out opposition to the imperious archbishop.</p><p>
   12. Charles had but few means to enforce obedience
to his rule.  Without a strong police or a standing
army, he had no force under his control that
<note place="foot" n="34">The Star Chamber and its Victims</note>.
could repress riot or rebellion, but the early
opponents to his authority were mere isolated
individuals who could be coerced by his lawyers and
tribunals. The Common-Law courts had often helped the
king, when Parliament had failed to support him; but their
rigid respect for the letter of the law, and their distrust of
all innovations, made them very unfit instruments for
pressing Charles's later policy. Accordingly the king trusted
more and more to those novel courts which had been set up
in Tudor times to maintain law and order against an
overpowerful nobility and a riotous population. These bodies had
long outlived their use, and were now turned to subverting the
liberty of the subject, and upholding the royal prerogative.
Chief among these was the Star Chamber, and the Council
of the North, a sort of local Star Chamber that sat at York.
The Star Chamber now made itself odious by its severity and
secrecy. In <date value="1630">1630</date> it ordered
Alexander Leighton, a Scots
minister who had turned physician, to be imprisoned "in a
nasty dog-hole, full of rats and mice," flogged and cropped of
his ears for writing a book against bishops called Sion's Plea
against Prelacy.  In <date value="1633">1633</date>
it condemned to a heavy fine
Henry Sherfeld, formerly member of parliament for Salisbury,
for dashing his stick through a painted window in a
church, that " obscured the light and caused much superstition.
" In the same year it sentenced William Prynne, a






<pb id="p.216" n="216"/> <note place="foot" n="35"> <date value="1637">1637</date>--<date value="1640">1640</date></note>

learned lawyer and antiquary, but a narrow minded and
intolerant theologian, to lose his ears in the pillory, pay a
heavy fine, and be shut up during the king's pleasure for
having libelled Queen Mary (who was fond of acting in
masques), by his violent attack on the drama in his pon-
derous volume called Histriomastix, or The Scourge of
Stage Players. In <date value="1637">1637</date>
Prynne was a second time sentenced
along with Dr. Thomas Bastwick, a physician who
had written against bishops, and Henry Burton, a Puritan
clergyman, who had lost his living for calling bishops
"caterpillars" and "antichristian mushrumps." All three
stood in the pillory together, after which the hangman cut
off the stumps of Prynne's ears and the whole ears of his
comrades. Their progress to the pillory was a triumphal
procession, the people strewing herbs and flowers in their
path, and roaring and weeping at their mutilation. They
were then confined in distant prisons.</p><p>
  By such acts Charles and Laud gained a temporary
triumph. Nor did they spare greater offenders. Laud's
old rival, Bishop Williams of Lincoln, was fined &#x00A3;10,000
and shut up in the Tower on a charge of betraying the
king's secrets. But to clergymen of Laud's own school every
honour was paid.   His successor as President of St.
John's, Dr. Juxon, was made Bishop of London and Lord
High Treasurer.  The highest offices of state were
conferred on clergymen who would uphold the Church and
the prerogative.</p><p>
  13. Sir Thomas Wentworth was now the great ally of
Laud in carrying out the system of Thorough. After his
<note place="foot" n="36">Wentworth,<dateRange from="1593" to="1641">1593-1641</dateRange>.</note>
abortive attempt at mediation in <date value="1628">1628</date> he gave
 up the Parliament for the court.  In <date value="1628">1628</date>
Wentworth was created a peer and made President of the
Council of the North. He was no mere apostate, for he
had always desired a strong government which would carry
out great reforms to suit the needs of the nation, and, like
Bacon, he hoped for a more liberal policy from an enlightened king,
with a Council of statesmen, than from the
mob of intolerant country gentlemen that thronged the
benches of the Commons. Wentworth was the strongest
and ablest of Charles's advisers, and, had the king given
him unlimited confidence, might well have played the
part of an English Richelieu. But he was often thwarted
by the factions of Charles's weak and irresolute cabinet.
He was a man of " tall stature, but stooped much in the
neck. His countenance was cloudy whilst he moved or






 <pb id="p.217" n="217"/>

sat thinking, but when he spoke he had a lightsome and
pleasant air."  "His apparel was plain and his fashion
humble enough." Yet his "natural roughness" and the
"terror of his bended brows" overawed opposition. He
was harsh, stern, overbearing, and unscrupulous, and the
one formidable enemy of the popular cause.
  14. In <date value="1632">1632</date>,
  Wentworth was made Lord Deputy of
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>. Here he set himself resolutely to work to establish
peace, order, and sound government. Despite
the completion of the Conquest of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> and
<note place="foot" n="37">  Wentworth's rule in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>,<dateRange from="1632" to="1640">1632-1640</dateRange></note>
the Plantation of Ulster, the island was still               					 .
full of disorder. Wentworth put down the civil wars which
still went on between the native chiefs, cleared the seas of
pirates, and dealt out even justice to every class of Irishmen.
He encouraged agriculture, especially the growth of flax,
and started the linen manufacture. He reformed the lax
state of the Protestant Church, while conniving at the
celebration of mass by the priests of the Catholic majority.
Protestantism in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> began a real existence under
prelates like James Ussher, the learned, moderate, and
upright Archbishop of Armagh (<date value="1624">1624</date>); the holy William
Bedell, Bishop of Kilmore (<date value="1629">1629</date>), who learned the Irish
tongue and procured the translation of the Old Testament
into that language, and James Bramhall, the Deputy's chaplain,
a strong and learned Laudian, and Bishop of Derry
after <date value="1634">1634</date>.  In <date value="1634">1634</date>,
Wentworth half-threatened, halfcoaxed
the Irish Parliament into granting a large supply,
with which he set on foot a numerous and well-disciplined
army. The promises of redress of grievances by which the
money had been obtained he shamelessly broke.    He
disgusted the ruling classes by such harsh and cruel
acts as the condemnation of Lord Mountmorris to death
for mutiny.  He disliked the wild and disorderly ways
of the native Irish, and spread terror among them by
projecting a Plantation of Connaught, which would have
driven them from their last retreats. He grasped clearly
that strong government (such as England now administers in
India) was the best remedy for <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>'s woes, and he
made <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> more rich and prosperous than she had ever
been before. But he trampled on the feelings and rights of
every class and creed. Celtic native and English colonist,
Catholic and Protestant, joined together in fierce, silent
hatred of their masterful governor. Yet for the moment
the reign of Thorough was fully set up.</p><p>
  15. The union of the Scottish and English Crowns in







<pb id="p.218" n="218"/>  <note place="foot" n="38"><date value="1603">1603</date>--<date value="1637">1637</date></note>

<date value="1603">1603</date>, had involved many fateful results to the smaller and
weaker country. The dignity, wealth, and power of the
English monarchy stood in such vivid contrast
<note place="foot" n="39"><placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> under <persName key="James I">James I</persName>.,<dateRange from="1603" to="1625">1603-1625</dateRange> </note>     											    to the insignificance and helplessness of a
King of Scots, that it was inevitable that
James should endeavour to make his authority as strong
in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> as it was in England. He failed in his attempt
to bring about a complete union of the kingdoms. For
this, English opinion was not as yet ripe. He therefore
set to work to remodel the institutions of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> after
the fashion of those of England. He hoped in this way
to make himself as powerful in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> as he believed
that he was in his new kingdom.</p><p>
  The Highlands of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, ruled by the clan chieftains,
were quite outside the royal power. Even in the Lowlands
the king was kept in check by a powerful, self-strenuous
<note place="foot" n="40">The Restoration of Episcopacy,<dateRange from="1600" to="1610">1600-1610</dateRange>.</note>        												   seeking, and tumultuous nobility, and a strong,
, and popular clergy, who represented
the new <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> that the Reformation had produced.
James's first object was to cut down the power of the Church,
which, with its democratic leanings and love of absolute
freedom  from state control, stood in the strongest contrast
to the law-abiding and king-respecting Church of
England. "No bishop, no king," was James's generalisation
from his Scottish experience. His great object was to
restore Episcopacy in Presbyterian <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> as the essential
preliminary to the strengthening of the royal power. He
had already, in <date value="1600">1600</date>, set up nominal bishops in the Kirk.
But these were mere state officials sitting in Parliament,
without consecration, duties, or estates. Bit by bit James
clothed these phantoms with power. In <date value="1606">1606</date>, he drove
Andrew Melville, the head of the Presbyterian opposition,
into banishment, restored the bishops to their temporal
lordships and estates, and set up Constant Moderators (in
lieu of elective chairmen) in every Presbytery, putting in
bishops when he could to hold these offices. In <date value="1610">1610</date> James
persuaded a packed General Assembly at Glasgow to accept
the bishops as moderators in each diocesan synod and as
the ordainers of the clergy. The Scots bishops now got
Episcopal consecration from England, and for the first time
became realities in the Church, though simply as something
added to the pre-existing Presbyterian system.  In <date value="1617">1617</date>
James visited <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. He told the Scots Parliament that
the Scots were barbarians, and ought to learn the good
customs of the English, since they had already adopted






  <pb id="p.219" n="219"/>

from their neighbours the vices of smoking and wearing fine
clothes. In <date value="1618">1618</date>, he forced the General Assembly at Perth
to accept the Five Articles of Perth, which directed that
the Communion should be received in a kneeling posture,
and that the chief Church festivals, such as Christmas and
Easter, should be religiously observed.  This was the
limit of James's success.</p><p>
  Despite bishops and the Perth Articles, the Scottish
Church was still Calvinistic and Puritan. <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>., with
the advice of Laud, resolved to carry on the
anti-Puritan policy a good deal further. In
<note place="foot" n="41">  <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>. and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>,<dateRange from="1625" to="1637">1625-1637</dateRange>.</note>
<date value="1633">1633</date>, he went to
Edinburgh to be crowned   King of Scots. He was
accompanied by Laud. At his
coronation the Scots bishops wore "white rochets and
copes of gold," and "bowed the knee" before a crucifix
"curiously wrought on the tapestry at the back of the
altar." Charles set up a new bishopric in Edinburgh, having
as its Cathedral the noble collegiate Church of St. Giles.
He ordered the clergy to wear "whites," that is surplices,
during divine service. He desired now to set up a liturgy
instead of the long prayers without book that the Scots
loved. Laud, ever eager for uniformity, wished to bring
in the English Prayer Book, while the Scots bishops
wanted an independent form of prayer of their own. At
last, in <date value="1637">1637</date>, a compromise was arranged. A special Scots
Prayer Book was drawn up, based almost altogether on the
English services, except that in those very points for which
Puritans disliked the English book, the doctrines of Laud's
school were brought out with greater emphasis. But the
attempt to impose on Scotsmen the " mass book" of " black
Prelacy" brought about a storm that was not to abate until
it had laid low the mighty fabric of despotism that Charles
had striven to build up in all the three kingdoms.</p></div2>

 <p>  1. For many years the people of the three kingdoms had
 submitted patiently to the growing tyranny. About <date value="1637">1637</date>
 public opinion began to stir itself from its
 <note place="foot" n="1"> The Beginningsof Resistance,<dateRange from="1637" to="1640">1637-1640</dateRange>.</note>
 lethargy.  The strong feeling against the

 itself felt in the outburst of enthusiasm that made popular

<note place="foot" n="2">-<date value="1640">1640</date></note>


 <pb id="p.221" n="221"/>

  Charles made an effort to prevent <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> from slipping
entirely away from his authority.  He saw that he had
gone too far, and sent down as his representative James
Hamilton, Marquis of Hamilton, a weak,
<note place="foot" n="3"> The Glasgow Assembly andthe Abolitionof Episcopacy<date value="1638">1638</date></note>
self-seeking courtier, anxious for compromises.
It was a great triumph for the Scots opposition
 when Hamilton revoked the Prayer Book
and summoned a General Assembly at Glasgow for
November <date value="1638">1638</date>.
But the Assembly claimed jurisdiction
 over the bishops, whereupon Hamilton declared it
dissolved. The Assembly, maintaining that the State had
no right to interfere with the spiritual power, went on with
its work all the same, and abolished Episcopacy.</p><p>
  The Marquis of Huntly, head of the great Gordon clan,
strove to raise the north-east in the king's favour, but was
put down by Montrose. Charles thereupon resolved to coerce
his unruly subjects by an English army. But the pressed
men, who gathered together at Berwick to fight the Scots,
were badly trained and out of sympathy with
<note place="foot" n="4">The FirstBishops' War,<date value="1639">1639</date></note>
the king's policy.  The Scots army which
encamped against them on Diunse Law (a
solitary hill over against Dunse, a town twelve miles from
Berwick) was enthusiastic and well drilled, many of the
troops, like the general, Alexander Leslie, having fought
hard and well for the Protestant cause in <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>. Charles
found that his men would not stand fire, and that it was
useless to continue the campaign. On 18th June he signed
with the rebels the Treaty of Berwick, by which it was
agreed that the civil and religious grievances of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>
should be settled by a free Parliament and Assembly.
Before long the General Assembly and Parliament met and
declared once more for the abolition of Episcopacy. Charles
loved bishops so well that he broke his word, adjourned their
sessions, and again resolved to have recourse to the sword.
 </p><p>  3. Wentworth came over from <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> to England and was
 made Earl of Strafford. His strong head and clear eye made
 him necessary to the weak king in such a crisis,
 <note place="foot" n="5"> The Short Parliament,April-May,<date value="1640">1640</date>.</note>
 and for the first time Charles really gave him
 his confidence. Strafford saw that Charles
 could not succeed if he blindly set himself
 against public opinion, and urged him to summon a Parlia ment.
 Very reluctantly Charles took his advice, and on
 13th April <date value="1640">1640</date> his Fourth Parliament gathered together
 at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. John Pym, a Somerset gentleman of great
 courage, resolution, oratorical skill, and statecraft, became

the leader of the Commons. Hampden, the hero of the
resistance to Ship Money, ably seconded his efforts.
Pym demanded that redress of grievances should go before
supply. Charles offered to give up Ship Money in return
for twelve subsidies-nearly a million of money. But the
Commons wanted to get more and give less. On 5th May
Charles dissolved Parliament just as the Commons were
preparing to express their sympathy with the Scots. It was
known as the Short Parliament.</p><p>
  4. The dauntless Strafford still persuaded the king to
wage offensive war against the Scots, and an army was
 again got ready for a Second Bishops' War.
<note place="foot" n="7">The Second Bishops' War,<date value="1640">1640</date>.</note>   							       But the pressed troops were mutinous and
 discontented. Several regiments showed their
Puritan sympathies by breaking open churches and making
bonfires of Laud's new communion rails. At home an
obstinate passive resistance made the continued levy of
Ship Money excessively difficult, while the rumour that
the wild Irish army was to be brought over by Strafford
to take away Englishmen's liberty, spread a general
indignation. The Scots did not wait for Charles's advance,
but crossed the Tweed at Coldstream. For the first time
in history, a Scots army marched through Northumberland
amidst the welcome of the inhabitants. Even the fierce
Highlanders, with their bows and arrows, plundered none
save "Popish recusants" and the bishop and chapter of
Durham. On 28th August, the English strove to defend the
passage of the Tyne at Newburn, a few miles higher up
than Newcastle. But the Scots, from the high ground on
the north of the river, poured a well-directed fire on their
enemies drawn up on the flat southern bank. The English
broke and fled, and the Scots dashed through the river and
occupied their position. Despairing of further resistance,
Charles again entered into negotiations. In October, the
Treaty of Ripon left Northumberland and Durham in the
hands of the Scots as a security for the payment of the
&#x00A3;850 a day which the king promised to pay the troops until
the permanent settlement was effected. This was at last
arranged in <date value="1641">1641</date>, on terms that left all <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> in the
hands of the Presbyterians.</p><p>
  5. Charles, at his wits' end for money, now summoned a
Great Council at York. This was a gathering of peers
<note place="foot" n="8">The Council at York.</note>
alone, and was a revival of the old Parliaments
  of nobles, which had fallen into disuse since
the setting up of the Parliament of the Three Estates.





                <pb id="p.223" n="223"/>

However, the time had passed when the nobles could even
pretend to act as a council of the nation without the representatives
of the people. The Great Council told Charles
that he must meet another Parliament.  To such straits
was he reduced, that he took their advice.</p><p>
  On  <date value="1640-11-03">3rd Nov.1640</date>,
  the Fifth Parliament of <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>.
met together at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. The whole of the Commons
and a large minority in the Lords were now
<note place="foot" n="9">The Meeting of the Long Parliament,<date value="1640-11-03">3 Nov. 1640</date>.</note>
bent on pushing matters to a conclusion.
Charles was at last at their mercy. He could
only pay the Scots if they granted him  a
subsidy. The Scots army put, for the first time, an armed
force at the disposal of the Parliament, while Charles himself
 had none. The king was forced to stand aside while a
series of well-directed blows was levelled against the great
fabric of despotism, so laboriously built up during the last
eleven years. William Lenthall, a lawyer, was chosen
speaker.  Pym  and Hampden were the leaders of the
popular party. Among the less prominent of their followers
was the member for the borough of Cambridge, Hampden's
cousin, Oliver Cromwell, a Huntingdonshire squire of small
means but good family, descended from a Welsh nephew
of the famous Thomas Cromwell.</p><p>
  6. The first desire of the Commons was vengeance on the
king's advisers. They believed that Strafford and Laud had
formed a deliberate plot with the Pope to
<note place="foot" n="10">Execution of Strafford<date value="1641-05-12"> 12 May1641</date>.</note>
bring back despotism and Catholicism, and                   				  ,
the queen's foolish intrigues and earnest requests
for help from the papal agents gave some colour to
the notion. On Pym's motion, Laud was impeached of
high treason, as "the root and ground of all our miseries."
The Lords sent him to the Tower. Secretary Windebank
and Lord Keeper Finch fled to Holland. But the worst
vengeance of the Commons was reserved for Strafford.</p><p>
  Sir Harry Vane, the ardent and visionary son of Secretary
Vane, had found among his father's papers notes of a
speech by Strafford in the Council in which he urged the
king to use the Irish army to reduce either England or
<placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. On this was based an impeachment for treason,
the Commons maintaining that Strafford's counsel amounted
to levying war against the king. It was a wholly political
and arbitrary interpretation of the rigid law of treason.
Treason was an offence against the king; and the Commons
really accused Strafford of treason against the nation, which
was a crime that the law of England knew nothing of






<pb id="p.224" n="224"/>       <note place="foot" n="11"> [<date value="1641">1641</date>--<date value="1641">1641</date></note>

The House of Lords, the judges of the impeachment, were
no friends of Strafford, but many wished well to the king,
and more were doubtful whether the law could thus be
wrested. Despairing of convicting their enemy by this
method, the Commons thought it wise to drop the impeachment,
and preferred to follow one of the worst precedents
of Tudor times by bringing in a Bill of Attainder. This
was simply an ordinary act of Parliament, enacting by
virtue of the absolute rights of the legislature that the person
condemned should be put to death. The Bill of Attainder
was carried in the Commons by two hundred and four to
fifty-nine, and the minority were denounced in a placard as
"Straffordians, betrayers of their country." The queen now
gave her support to some hot-headed courtiers and officers
who had formed what was called the Army Plot. This was
an attempt to use the troops that had been collected to
fight the Scots and were not yet disbanded, to coerce the
Commons into desisting from their attacks on the King's
ministers and policy.  Pym discovered and denounced the
intrigue.  The Lords were frightened into passing the
Bill of Attainder. Charles, after a pitiful hesitation, gave
the royal assent, though he had lately assured Strafford
that, "upon the word of a king, you shall not suffer in
life, honour, or fortune." "If my own person only were
in danger," he now said, " I would gladly venture it to save
Lord Strafford's life: but seeing my wife, children, and
kingdom are concerned in it, I am forced to give way."
On 12th May <date value="1641">1641</date>,
Strafford was beheaded on Tower Hill.
"His condition," lamented Charles, "is more happy than
mine."</p><p>
  7. A whole series of constitutional reforms was carried
out by the victorious Parliament. Its first care was to
<note place="foot" n="12">  Constitutional.Reforms and Safeguards, <dateRange from="1640" to="1641">1640-1641</dateRange>.</note>
  destroy the chief supports of the system of
  arbitrary government. The Star Chamber was
  abolished, and its victims-Prynne, Bastwick,
 and Burton-were released from their prisons
in triumph. The Court of High Commission, the Council
of the North, and the other new courts by which
Charles had sought to supersede the Common Law, shared
the fate of the Star Chamber.  The unconstitutional
decisions of the judges were reversed. Ship Money was
declared illegal. The levying of Tonnage and Poundage
and the New Impositions, the levying of fines for not
taking up knighthood, the pretensions of the king to
enlarge the forests, were all unequivocally condemned.






            <pb id="p.225" n="225"/>

The independence of the judges was secured by a law that
they should hold office during good behaviour, and not
simply at the king's pleasure. The extraordinary powers
which the Crown had claimed to inherit from Tudor times
were brought to an end; and a legal check put for the
future on all encroachments of the prerogative. Moreover,
ample care was taken to provide for the future security of
the Constitution.  A Triennial Act was passed which
enacted that not more than three years should pass by
without a Parliament, and provided that, if the king did
not summon one, other means should be taken to ensure
its assembling. Also in the crisis of the Army Plot
Charles was forced to accept an act that the existing Parliament
should not be dissolved without its own consent.
As with the impeachment of Strafford, there was practical
unanimity in all these proceedings. The king had set
himself against the nation, and now paid the penalty for
his defeat. There was as yet no royalist party.</p><p>
8. The gievances in the Church were even more felt
than the grievances in the State, and Parliament set to
work with great zeal to break up the system
of Laud.  In <date value="1640">1640</date>
<note place="foot" n="13">EcclesiasticalReform and theformation
of aChurch Party,<date value="1641">1641</date>.</note>
the Convocation of Canterbury
 had granted Charles liberal supplies,
and had passed new Canons declaring that
"the most high and sacred order of kings is
of divine right," and that " for subjects to bear arms against
their kings was to resist the power ordained by God.'
Enraged by such acts, the Commons joined together with
one accord in impeaching Laud, and in passing a Bill
turning the bishops out of the House of Lords, which the
Lords themselves rejected. Thereupon Sir Edward Dering
brought forward, with Pym and Hampden's support, what
was called the Root-and-Branch Bill, which proposed to do
away with the bishops altogether, and put the control of the
Church in the hands of nine lay commissioners. This
measure first broke up the Long Parliament into parties.
All were willing to get rid of the " innovations," and make
the Church dependent on Parliament, but a large party in
the House was warmly attached to the Church as set up by
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. Those who still loved Episcopacy and the Prayer
Book stoutly opposed Dering's revolutionary proposal.
This group found spokesmen in Edward Hyde, an able and
rising lawyer, and in Lucius Cary, Viscount Falkland in
the Scottish Peerage, and a man of the largest tolerance
and liberality, with a warm heart, a sweet but impulsive







<pb id="p.226" n="226"/> <note place="foot" n="14"><date value="1641">1641</date>-<date value="1641">1641</date></note>

temper, wide learning, deep religious feeling, and a rare
sense of uprightness. They fought so well that the second
reading of the Bill was only carried by a small majority.
It had not got through its final stages when in September
<date value="1641">1641</date> the first session of the Long Parliament came to an
end.</p><p>
  9. In the summer of <date value="1641">1641</date> Charles went to <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>,
hoping, in return for his complete submission, to persuade
 the Scots to take up arms against the English
<note place="foot" n="15">The Incidentand the Irish Rebellion, <date value="1641">1641</date>. </note>   								     Parliament. But the Scots and English were
 still on the best of terms. A plot called the
Incident, to arrest Argyll and the Presbyterian leaders, was
detected, and Charles, though vehemently denying all complicity,
got much of the discredit of it. He returned to
England more unpopular than ever.</p><p>
  A sudden rebellion now broke out in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>. After
Strafford's return to England the government remained
with two Lords Justices, the active Sir William Parsons
and the aged and indolent Sir John Borlase.  Parsons
pushed forward Strafford's policy of colonising Connaught,
and was eager to persecute the Catholics. The Irish Parliament
was indignant and got quite beyond his control,
especially as Charles, hoping to win Irish support, conceded
everything that the Irish Commons asked for, and intrigued
with the Catholic Lords of the Pale (descendants of the old
Norman settlers) to get the Irish army brought over to help
him in England. But behind the Catholic Lords were the
multitude of oppressed and starving peasants and the newly
conquered tribesmen of the north, eager for revenge
and retaliation.  In  <date value="1641-10">October1641</date> a plot was formed
by a few desperate Irish leaders to seize Dublin and at
the same time attack the Ulster colonists. The assault
on Dublin failed; but the Ulster rising succeeded. Sir
Phelim  O'Neill, a vain braggart desperado, raised the
greatest of the ancient clans of Ulster against the Saxons
who had supplanted them, and was before long joined
by Owen Roe O'Nell, the gallant and high-minded chief
of the clan, who in his exile had won great glory as a
soldier in the Spanish service. Many of the scattered
colonists of Ulster were barbarously murdered or tortured
to death. Others were driven from their homes, destitute
and hungry, to make their way to Dublin.     Fearful
atrocities were wrought on every side.  The Strafford
system of Thorough was violently overthrown. In England
the greatest horror was excited, and men blamed the






         <pb id="p.227" n="227"/>

king, if not for stirring up the revolt, for engaging in the
intrigues with the Papists, which had been the signal for
the outbreak.</p><p>
   10. When Parliament met for an autumn session it was
 distracted by divided counsels. Pym and his
 party distrusted the king more than ever, and
 <note place="foot" n="16">The Grand Remonstrance. Formation of aconstitutional Royalist Party<date value="1641">1641</date></note>
 drew up the Grand Remonstrance.
  </p><p> This was a long document of two hundred and four
 clauses, which enumerated all the unconstitutional
 acts of Charles from the beginning of his reign, and
 attributed "the root of all this mischief to a malignant and pernicious
 design of subverting the fundamental laws and principles of
 government upon which the religion and justice of this kingdom are
 firmly established." It demanded as remedies "that his Majesty
 shall employ in places of trust such as Parliament may have cause to
 confide in," and that "a general synod of the most grave, most
 learned, and judicious divines be assembled to settle the future state
 of religion."</p><p>
   The Remonstrance was a declaration that, despite all
Charles's concessions, the Commons would be satisfied with
nothing less than getting the government into their own
hands, and abolishing the existing Church system. Such a
policy drove the supporters of Hyde and Falkland to become
a constitutional royalist as well as a Church party. They
stoutly opposed that part of the Remonstrance which suggested
revolutionary remedies. About midnight on 22nd
November, after a hot debate, the followers of Pym and
Hampden carried the whole document by the narrow
majority of eleven.</p><p>
  Two days later Charles came back to London from <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>.
  He sent out a proclamation in which he made himself
  the champion of the existing constitution in Church and
State. He plucked up courage to reject the requests made
in the Remonstrance. After some delay he even gave office
to Falkland and his friend Colepepper. He had now for
the first time the chance of making himself the leader of
a great national party.  But neither Charles nor his supporters
had yet learned wisdom. The bishops were alarmed
at the noisy crowds, that beset the House of Lords, crying
"No bishops !" and withdrew from its debates, protesting
that all that was done during their enforced absence was
invalid. This annoyed the Lords, jealous of the prelates'
claim to be an essential part of their House. It led the
indignant Commons to impeach of treason Williams,
recently appointed Archbishop of York, and eleven other
bishops.
</p><p>





<pb id="p.228" n="228"/>              <note place="foot" n="17"><date value="1642">1642</date>--<date value="1642">1642</date></note>

  11. Charles himself now went back to his old personal
policy, and again put himself out of touch with public
<note place="foot" n="18">The Arrest of the Five Members, <date value="1642">1642</date>.</note>
opinion.  At the very moment when his
admission of Falkland and Colepepper to office
seemed the best proof of his wish to govern
on constitutional lines, the rumour that the popular leaders
had proposed to impeach the Queen led Charles to the
most fatal false step that he ever made. On 3rd January
<date value="1642">1642</date> he impeached Lord Kimbolton and five commoners,
Pym, Hampden, Denzil Holles, Arthur Hazlerigge, and
William Strode for having "traitorously invited a foreign
power (the Scots) to invade England," and therefore
for having conspired to levy war against the king. But
the king's right to impeach was very doubtful and the
Commons took no notice of the charge. Charles thereupon
went down to the House attended by a great crowd of
armed followers including "divers desperate ruffians." But
the Five Members had been forewarned and fled to the City.
Charles entered the House and stood before the Speaker's
chair, searching eagerly round the room for the Five Members.
"Where are they?" he said to the Speaker. Lenthall
dropped on his knee and answered, "I have neither
eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place, but as this
House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here."
Charles once more looked over the benches. " I see that
the birds are flown," he now said. "I do expect that you
shall send them unto me as soon as they return hither." He
then left the House amidst angry cries of "Privilege!
Privilege !" His followers were eager for massacre and
violence, but Charles went back to the palace, angry at his
failure yet afraid of decided action.</p><p>
  12. The Commons now moved to the City  which was
enthusiastically on their side. Thoroughly baffled, Charles
 left Whitehall on 10th Jan., abandoning the
<note place="foot" n="19"> The militiaOrdinance and the preparations for Civil War,<date value="1642">1642</date>.</note>         							    capital and all the resources of the state to
 his enemies. Next day the Commons went
 back in triumph to <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. They had
for the time broken with their love of old
precedents, and had determined to show that they were
masters. The Lords were forced by mob violence to accept
their measures. Both Houses again sent to the king a bill
"disenabling all persons in holy orders to exercise any
temporal jurisdiction or authority," and therefore excluding
bishops from the Lords. In his despair, Charles gave the
royal assent to it. They next sent up a Militia Ordinance,







         <pb id="p.229" n="229"/>

transferring the control of the trained bands of militia (which
were in these days the only armed force in the country), to
officers chosen by themselves. "Not for an hour," was
Charles's angry answer. But the two Houses appointed a
joint Committee of Safety, and decreed that the ordinance
should be executed despite the king. They got possession
of the chief fortresses, such as Portsmouth, the Tower of
London, and Hull. Charles appeared outside the walls of
Hull, but Sir John Hotham, the Parliamentary commander,
shut the gates in his face. In June the king rejected the
Nineteen Propositions which the Houses had presented
to him at York, and which required him to surrender
every scrap of power. Both sides raised troops and appointed
generals. In July the first  blood  was shed at
Manchester, when Lord  Strange (afterwards Earl of
Derby)-sought to prevent the townsmen from carrying
out the Militia Ordinance. On 22nd August, Charles set
up his standard at Nottingham. This was the sign of civil
war.</p><p>
  .13 The struggle that now began was called the Great
Rebellion and the Great Civil War. It was no simple fight
between despotism  and liberty.  Charles's
<note place="foot" n="20"> General Character of the Great Rebellion,<dateRange from="1642" to="1646">1642-1646</dateRange>.</note>
concessions had made many who loved Parliament
and the old constitution ardent in his
support. With Hyde and Falkland still at
their head, most of the party that had opposed the Remonstrance
fought for the king. Bit by bit a majority of the
Lords slipped away from <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>and ranged themselves
on Charles's side. Moreover the ecclesiastical struggle
complicated the  olitical struggle. Many who still distrusted
Charles, distrusted Parliament still more, since
Parliament had pledged itself to overthrow the Church and
set up a rigid and exclusive Calvinistic despotism over
consciences.  The real strength of the Royalist cause was
still the Church party, which, though disliking Laud,
loved the Prayer Book and Episcopacy. Side by side with
it were the whole of the Roman Catholics, who, though
expecting little from the Church, were sure to be bitterly
persecuted by the Parliament.  Dashing but unscrupulous
soldiers of fortune, such as the king's nephews, the young
Counts Palatine, Prince Rupert and Prince Maurice, fought
bravely but plundered recklessly in the King's name. Like
the mere courtiers, they cared nothing for religion and
liberty, and the fortune of war often gave them the upper
hand in the weak king's councils.  They were specially






<pb id="p.230" n="230"/>              <note place="foot" n="21"><date value="1642">1642</date>--<date value="1642">1642</date></note>

favoured by the queen, who worked strenuously but toolishly
on her husband's behalf.</p><p>
  The Rebellion was not complicated by any social
issues, dividing class from class.  Though the majority
of lords and gentry fought for the king, a considerable
minority ranged themselves with the Parliament, and supplied
it with all its leaders, both in council and camp.
Though fighting against the king, the supporters of the
Parliament professed that they were upholding the monarchy,
and always pretended to act in the king's name.
But religion was the chief motive that implelled them to
draw the sword.   All Puritans who desired to reform
the Church root and branch were eager for the Parliament,
as were the growing sects of Separatists, who
shrank from no revolution. The mass of th God-fearing
yeomanry and the middle class townsmen were against
the king.  As far as districts went, the rich and populous
south and east were Parliamentary.   London headed
the resistance, though many of the rich merchants secretly
wished well to the king. The whole of the royal navy
declared for Parliament.  The Eastern counties were
banded together in an Eastern Association to uphold the
Parliament, of which Oliver Cromwell soon became the
leading spirit. The Puritan clothing towns of the West
Riding were the centre of opposition to the Crown amidst
Royalist <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName>. Nearly all <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> was ardent for the
king. But the war was neither a war of classes nor one
of districts. There was fighting in nearly every county
besides the general great  campaigns. The Royalists were
nicknamed Cavaliers, and the Parliamentarians Roundheads,
from the close cropped hair affected by some of the stricter
sort. Both sides found it hard to collect funds, but the
Parliament which had possession of all the resources of the
governmemt, and contolled the wealthier part of the country,
stood in a much stronger financial position than the king.</p><p>
  14. Charles was soon at the head of a gallant army, of
which he made the Earl of Lindsay general, though the
<note place="foot" n="22">The Campaign of <date value="1642">1642</date></note>.
horse, under Prince Rupert, took their orders directly from
the king. Charles's plan was
to push southwards to London before the Parliament's
troops were ready. But the <persName key="Earl of Essex">Earl of <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName></persName>, the Puritan
general (the son of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s favourite), soon followed
<note place="foot" n="23">Edgehill</note>
in his track, and, on 23rd Oct., Charles
saw from the ridge of Edgehill the Parliamentary
army drawn up against him in the rolling plains







             <pb id="p.231" n="231"/>

of Warwickshire that stretch northward towards Stratford-on-Avon.</p><p>

  After the fashion of the time, Charles went down from the heights
and ranged his troops on the level ground between Edgehill and the
little town of Kineton. The foot were in the middle, and the horse,
under Rupert and Wilmot, at the wings. The battle was a strange
one. The king's cavalry easily routed the horsemen of the Parliament,
and drove them in confusion into Kineton town. Their wild
haste left the king's infantry to fight against <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> without any
support from cavalry, and after a hot fight, Charles's foot were
pushed back towards the hill, until nightfall and the return of Rupert
caused <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> to withdraw his troops.

</p><p>  Next day <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> retreated to Warwick, leaving Charles
the fruits if not the name of victory.     The king now
marched   through Oxford and Reading towards
<note place="foot" n="24"> Brentford.</note>
 London.    On IIth Nov., Rupert again
scattered the Puritan foot at Brentford, eight miles west of
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.   The trained bands of London were massed
two miles nearer town on Turnham Green, but Charles did

not venture to attack them. He retreated to Oxford, which
henceforth became his headquarters. He was never nearer
victory than when he thus turned back at the very gates of
London.</p><p>
  15. During the winter months there was but little fighting,
and much hollow negotiation for peace. The early stages
<note place="foot" n="26">Campaign of <date value="1643">1643</date>.</note>             							 of the campaign of <date value="1643">1643</date> were decidedly in
 favour of Charles. The main armies of king
and Parliament, drawn up between Oxford and London,
did not show much energy. <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> took Reading in the
spring, but had no heart to push on against Oxford, though
Hampden, as prominent in war as he had
<note place="foot" n="27">   Chalgrove    </note>
been in debate, strongly urged on him to
do so. But on 18th June, Rupert made a brilliant foray
into the midst of the Parliamentary quarters, and on his
retreat turned and routed the foe at Chalgrove Field, ten
miles east of Oxford. Hampden was here shot through the
shoulder, and rode off the field " before the action was over,
which he never used to do." He died a few days later at
Thame. "Every honest man," wrote a Puritan colonel,
"hath a share in the loss. He was a gallant man, an
honest man, an able man, and, take all, I know not to any
living man second."</p><p>
  More stirring scenes were being enacted in the north
and west, where separate campaigns were fought with independent
armies. William Cavendish, Earl of Newcastle,
a very fine gentleman and a magnificent horseman, but a
poor general and politician, gradually conquered all <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName>
for the king, defeating Lord Fairfax and his son, Sir
Thomas Fairfax, at Adwalton Moor, four miles
<note place="foot" n="28">Adwalton Moor. </note>
south of Bradford, on 30th June. Hull, the
only Parliamentary post remaining in <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName>, was now
closely besieged by the victorious royalists. At the same
time Sir Ralph Hopton with his army of loyal Cornishmen
defeated the Earl of Stamford at Stratton (16th May),
 a victory which secured Cornwall. Hopton
<note place="foot" n="29">Stratton.</note>
then advanced through Devon and Somerset.
On 5th July he checked the victorious career of Sir
William Waller on Lansdown near Bath, completing
 his triumph by a second battle at Roundway
<note place="foot" n="30">Waller's Defeat. </note>
Down, near Devizes (13th July). Rupert now
took Bristol by storm, and thus the second seaport of the
kingdom was won for the King.
</p><p>  Charles now wished that Hopton and Newcastle should
both march on London, but the rude Cornishmen and







                <pb id="p.233" n="233"/>

Yorkshiremen, who made up the victorious armies, had
no mind to leave their own country for long, especially
	as Hull still held out and the Parliamentary
	<note place="foot" n="31">Gloucester besieged.</note>
	garrison at Plymouth plundered far and wide.
Charles was therefore forced to give up his well-conceived
plan, until the capture of the enemy's fortresses completed
the royalist conquest of North and West. The
Northern and Western armies now strove to effect the
capture of Hull and Plymouth.       Moreover, Gloucester,
which commanded the lowest bridge over the Severn,
still cut off communications between Oxford, the southwest
and <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>, from which country Charles drew a very
large proportion of his infantry. The king, therefore, laid
siege to it in August with his main army.</p><p>
   This was the turning point of the war. Had Hull, Plymouth,
   and Gloucester fallen, London could hardly have
resisted the combined attack of three great
<note place="foot" n="32"> Relief ofGloucester.</note>
armies.   A  desperate effort was necessary.
The London trained bands joined <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>'s army in marching
to the relief of Gloucester. After a circuitous march to the
south to avoid Oxford, <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> looked down from Prestbury
Hill over the rich vale of the Severn. But Charles hastily
raised the siege, hoping to force <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> to a battle. On
8th September <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> marched through the gates of the
beleaguered town. Above was the proud inscription "A city
assailed by man but saved by God."       Charles failed to
tempt <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> to a battle and now sought to block up his way
back to London.     On 2oth September the
Puritan army was stopped in its retreat along
<note place="foot" n="33"> Newbury.</note>
the great western road at Newbury, twenty-seven miles
south of Oxford.

  </p><p>Charles held a strong position to the south-west of the town on a
ridge between the Kennet and the En Brook. <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> had to advance
to the attack through narrow lanes and deep copses, while to the
south his right had to march through the open country of Enborne
Heath, fully exposed to the terrible cavalry of Rupert. Charles had
simply to hold his own in a favourable position. For hours the fight
raged from hedge to hedge between the foot of the two armies. Meanwhile
Rupert, unapt to play a mere defensive game, easily scattered the
enemy's horse and charged the London trained bands with his wonted
fire. But the Londoners, said Hyde, "behaved themselves to wonder
and were the preservation of the army that day, standing as a bulwark
and rampire to defend the rest." Rupert's cavalry were caught in a narrow lane and shot down by scores from the deep banks that bounded it.
When night ended the fight the Puritan army still held its own. Next
day it was found that Charles had retreated to Oxford leaving <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>

the way open to London. It was a great triumph for the Roundhead
cause. Among those slain on the king's side was Falkland, who had
long been " weary of the times," and boasted that he would be " out
of it before night." He spurred his horse "more gallantly than
advisedly " through a gap in a hedge, where he offered himself as a
target to the bullets of the enemy and soon met his death.</p><p>

<p>  The misfortune that had beset the main Royalist army
was now    extended to their army in the north.     The
advance of Newcastle was now checked. On
<note place="foot" n="35">The Triumph of the Association   Army.</note>
11th October a successful sortie forced him to
 raise the siege of Hull. The same day the
army of the Eastern Association was led by their general,
the Earl of Manchester (formerly Lord Kimbolton), to
victory at Winceby Fight, where Colonel Cromwell led
the van with his cavalry regiment and narrowly escaped
death. This led to the Parliamentary conquest of Lincolnshire.
In the Association Army Cromwell now became
the leading spirit. He already set up an iron discipline
in his own "goodly company" of horse, and had filled






          <pb id="p.235" n="235"/>

every trooper with the loftiest religious enthusiasm. The
result was a force that was as daring and dashing, but
far more self-restrained and better drilled than  the
cavaliers of Rupert. Cromwell, in his own phrase, had
now set up "men of religion " against the king's"gentlemen of honour."</p><p>
  16. The campaign of <date value="1643">1643</date>
  had proved so evenly balanced
that both sides looked for outside help. Foreign assistance
was luckily impossible for either party, as the Thirty Years'
War still occupied the chief nations of Western Europe.
But within the British Islands help was to be expected in
two directions, and King and Parliament now sought new
allies in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. In September
<date value="1643">1643</date>, Charles
concluded a Cessation of arms with the Irish
<note place="foot" n="36">The Scots Alliance and the Adoption of  Presbyterianism.</note>
Catholics, and the Parliament joined with the
Scots in a treaty called the Solemn League
and Covenant, in which they swore to maintain
the Scottish Kirk, to reform religion in England and <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>
"according to the Word of God and the example of the
best reformed churches," and to extirpate "popery, prelacy,
superstition, heresy, schism, and profaneness."  On this
condition the Scots agreed to send their well-tried and
victorious army over the Border to help Parliament against
the King. Thus Charles made friends with Papists, while
Parliament at last adopted Presbyterianism, though few
Englishmen believed in the divine right of Presbytery like
the Scots. The Presbyterian Assembly of Divines that had
sat in <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> since the summer, now set to work to get
rid of bishops and the Prayer Book, to set up the rigid
Calvinistic doctrines, the synods and the long prayers that
the Scots preferred.  The league with the Scots was the
last work of Pym, who died in December.</p><p>
  17. Charles was now forced on the defensive.  His
agreement with the Irish Catholic Lords brought him much
ill-will and hardly any military advantage. In
<note place="foot" n="37">Campaign of<date value="1644">1644</date>.</note>
Jan. <date value="1644">1644</date>, the English
troops from <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>,who had been set free by the Cessation,
landed in England,
but they had been but a few weeks in the country,
when they were routed by Fairfax at Nantwich in Cheshire,
and more than half the prisoners took service with the
Parliamentary general. In February a Committee of Both
Kingdoms was set up, composed of members of the two
Houses of Parliament and some Scottish Commissioners,
to control the joint war of English and Scots against the
king. The Scots army, led by Leslie (since <date value="1641">1641</date> Earl of







<pb id="p.236" n="236"/>               <note place="foot" n="38"> <date value="1644">1644</date>--<date value="1644">1644</date></note>

Leven), now joined Fairfax, drove Newcastle's army into
York, and besieged that city. They were soon joined by the
<note place="foot" n="39">Royalist Disasters.</note>
army of the Eastern Association under
 Manchester and Cromwell.     Meanwhile Charles
was equally hard pressed in the South. <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> and Waller
united their forces and threatened    Oxford, from   which
Charles escaped, fearing to risk a siege.  <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> foolishly
divided his forces, leaving Waller to fight against the king,
while he himself invaded the royalist south-west.
 </p><p>  Rupert now left his uncle and rode northwards with his
gallant horsemen, intent on the relief of York. On his
way, he broke down the Puritan rule in Lancashire, and
relieved the heroic Countess of Derby, who had long been
straitly besieged in Lathom House. He then crossed the
moors into <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName>.    On his reaching Knaresborough,
eighteen miles to the west of York, the Puritan generals,
out-manceuvred by his skilful movements, raised the siege,
and  marshalled   their three armies on    Marston   Moor
(eight miles west of York), to block his advance.      But
Rupert cleverly avoided them, and swept round on his
left to York, joining forces with Newcastle, and taking
command of the combined army. His eager desire for
<note place="foot" n="40">Marston Moor. </note>
battle overcame the sluggishness of Newcastle,
and the retreating Puritans went back to their
position at Marston Moor, on the news that the Cavaliers
had drawn up their forces against them. Here, on 2nd July
<date value="1644">1644</date>, was fought the first really decisive battle of the war.
</p><p>  The three armies of the Parliament stood amidst the fields of rye
that covered the slopes of the long low ridge that, running east and
west behind Tockwith and Long Marston, overlooks the rough plain
of Marston Moor, lying to the north. On the left was Manchester,
and the army of the Association, whose extreme flank was protected
by Cromwell's horsemen. Leven with the Scots held the centre; while
the right was occupied by the Fairfaxes with their Yorkshiremen. A
long hedge and ditch and a road divided them from the Royalist
forces that were stationed in the plain. Here Rupert put himself over
against Cromwell, knowing that there the decisive struggle would be
fought; while Newcastle's northern army held the centre, and a strong
force of cavalry, under the drunken and ruffianly Goring held the left
wing. The armies faced each other until six in the evening, when
Rupert resolved to postpone the attack till next day. But as Rupert
was eating his supper, and Newcastle smoking a pipe in his carriage, the
Parliamentary army dashed over the ditch in sudden and unexpected
assault. Taken by surprise as they were, Rupert's cavalry fought
gallantly against the horsemen of Cromwell; "they stood at the
sword's point a pretty while, hacking one another." But a timely
charge of the Scots horse under David Leslie (Leven's nephew), turned






               <pb id="p.237" n="237"/>

the balance, and Rupert's Cavaliers were scattered "like a little
dust." In the centre the Scots kept their enemies in check; but to
the right the Fairfaxes were hopelessly defeated, and Goring chased
their demoralised troops along the road to Tadcaster. Sir Thomas
Fairfax, at great personal risk, sought out Cromwell, who, unlike
Rupert at Edgehill and Newbury, still kept his horsemen well under
centrol. Cromwell now turned from the pursuit, and caught Goring

<figure id="Fig.017" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.012.DO01.00017"><head>Battle of Marston Moor</head></figure>
















as he returned weary and without order from his pursuit of the
Yorkshiremen.  This settled the fate of the day.  "We never
charged but we routed the enemy," boasted Cromwell. "God made
them as stubble to our swords." Rupert's army had been hopelessly
scattered. Newcastle took ship to <placeName key="Flanders">Flanders</placeName> in despair. York opened
its gates to the victors. The whole of the north fell into the hands of
the "godly party."</p><p>

  Decisive for the north, Marston Moor had little immediate
effect on the struggle in the south. It shows how evenly
England was still divided that Charles's losses in <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName>
were almost balanced by his gains elsewhere. The
early successes of Montrose [see pages 241-2] in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>
made Leven unwilling to leave the Lowlands unprotected
by a further advance into England. In the south, Charles
still proved victorious.  On 29th June, he held Waller
in check by the hard      fought but indecisive battle of
Cropredy Bridge (over the Cherwell, north of Banbury),
after which Waller's trained bands went quietly home,
having no stomach for further fighting.       Charles then
pursued <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> into Cornwall, and forced his whole infantry
to surrender at Lostwithiel, the sluggish and desponding

general only escaping by boat on the open sea (1st Sep.).
The victorious army of the Association was then ordered
<note place="foot" n="42">The Last Royalist Successes. </note>
south to block the threatened advance of
Charles on London. On 27th Oct., Charles
and Manchester fought the Second Battle of Newbury,
where the laziness and weakness of the Presbyterian general
["a sweet, meek man"] allowed Charles to hold his own
and escape in the night.
 </p><p> 18. At the end of <date value="1644">1644</date>, Charles still held the field against
his revolted subjects; while the stern and ardent spirits,
<note place="foot" n="43">Rise ofIndependency.</note>
who already looked up to Cromwell as their
 leader, saw with disgust that the Scottish
alliance and the adoption of Presbyterianism had brought
the war no nearer the end. They loudly denounced the
self-seeking Scots, and held up to scorn the sluggishness
and incompetence of the great Presbyterian lords who had
waged war, as if afraid of the results of victory. The fortune
of war naturally brought to the top men of the extreme party,
who knew their own minds and were not afraid of revolution.
A great growth of the more enthusiastic types of Puritanism
had marked the outbreak of hostilities. The new party
of Independents, who wished to crush the king and set
up toleration for the sectaries, who had established religious
organisations of their own, began to make itself formidable.
So strong was their hold that, in deadly fear of the extremists,
the Presbyterians, who were remodelling the English Church on
the fashion of the Scottish with a view of
crushing out all dissent from it, now wished to make peace
and restore the king to at least a nominal power.</p><p>
  In  <date value="1645-01">Jan.1645</date>, negotiations for peace were begun at
Uxbridge; but failed, as Charles would not accept the
<note place="foot" n="44">Treaty of Uxbridge, <date value="1645">1645</date></note>
demand of the Parliament that he should take
the Covenant, surrender the militia, and repudiate
the Irish Cessation. Henrietta Maria sought for
French aid at Paris, while Charles gave a commission to
the Catholic Earl of Glamorgan to levy an army of Irish
and foreign Papists.
 </p><p> The extreme party grew stronger and stronger at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.
 On 10th Jan., the aged Laud, who had been shut
<note place="foot" n="45">Attainder of Laud.</note>
up in the Tower since <date value="1641">1641</date>, was executed for
   high treason by an Ordinance of Attainder.
It was a mere act of vengeance and served no end save to
embitter the struggle. Of more direct bearing on the
fortunes of the war was the resolution to reorganise the
military forces that fought against the King. In February,






            <pb id="p.239" n="239"/>

the New Model Ordinance was forced on the little knot of
timid peers that still sat at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. By it the various
armies of the Parliament were reorganised as a single whole,
as a thoroughly professional and permanent
<note place="foot" n="46"> The New Model and the Self-Denying Ordinance.</note>
body, under uniform command, stern discipline
and with regular pay, for which latter purpose
new taxes were imposed. The officers were
forced to take the Covenant, and side by side with the gentlemen
who had hitherto alone held command, commissions
were given to "plain russet-coated captains" of humbler
station, but of earnest Puritan views and strong love of
revolutionary change. In April, the Self-Denying Ordinance
completed the new system. By it all members of either
House of Parliament were compelled to resign their commands
within forty days. This finally got rid of <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>, Manchester,
and Waller; but Cromwell, who as member for Cambridge
should have resigned as well, was speedily appointed
Lieutenant-General, with supreme command of the horse.
He disliked taking the Covenant, both because he sighed
for universal toleration and thought Presbytery bondage,
and because he considered that military efficiency and not
religious orthodoxy ought to determine the position of an
officer in the army. But he saw that the New Model would
be no sure support of the dominant party, and swallowed
his scruples. Sir Thomas Fairfax had been nominated
General in the Ordinance. He was a tall dark man of few
words, and "meek and humble carriage"; a "lover of
learning," and a moderate and upright man. "In the field
he was so highly transported, that he would seem like a
man distracted and furious," and men spoke of his "irrational
and brutish valour." But he was a vigorous and
active soldier, upholding strong discipline, moving his forces
with great rapidity, and showing no contemptible skill in
planning his campaigns. Skippon, as Major-General, was
the third in command.</p><p>
  19. Charles began the campaign of
  <date value="1645">1645</date> with great energy,
while Fairfax was organising the New Model and wasting
his time in blockading Oxford, from which
<note place="foot" n="47"> The Campaign of<date value="1645">1645</date></note>
Charles had at last been forced to flee.            		     .
Charles took advantage of Fairfax's mistake to capture
Leicester, a central position, from which he could equally
threaten the Scots in <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName>, the eastern counties or
London itself. This forced Fairfax to abandon his attack on
Oxford and march in pursuit, while Charles, swayed as ever
by distracting counsels, loitered aimlessly in the midlands.







<pb id="p.240" n="240"/>            <note place="foot" n="48"><date value="1645">1645</date>--<date value="1645">1645</date></note>

  On 14th June the armies met between Naseby and Sibbertoft, in
Northamptonshire, about six miles south-west of Market Harborough.
               The king's troops (among whom a large proportion of
<note place="foot" n="49">Naseby.</note>
        		the foot were Welshmen) were outnumbered by nearly
three to two; and the impatience of Rupert had spoilt Charles's plan
of waiting, strongly posted on a hill two miles south of Harborough,
until Fairfax attacked him. Rupert forced on the battle by a premature
movement to the south. Thereupon Fairfax, by Cromwell's advice,
took up a strong position in a fallow field on a hill north of Naseby
village, where a long hedge protected his left. Skippon marshalled

<figure id="Fig.018" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.012.DO01.00018"><head>Battle of Naseby</head></figure>

the foot in the centre; Ireton (who afterwards married Cromwell's
daughter) commanded the left, while Cromwell posted himself with his
horse on the right. The king's army was drawn up on Dust Hill
opposite, with Rupert on the right facing Ireton, Astley in the centre
opposite Skippon, and Langdale over against Cromwell. Despite the
disparity of numbers the fight was furiously contested. Rupert defeated
Ireton, and pursued him towards Naseby village; just before reaching
which he came across the baggage train of the Parliamentary army.
The guard of the baggage attempted resistance, and did good service
to the enemy, for Rupert, checked in his wild career, rallied his troops,






             <pb id="p.241" n="241"/>

and, abandoning the baggage, returned to share in the main encounter.
But he was once more too late. In the centre the New Model infantry
barely held its own. Skippon was badly wounded, and his raw
recruits were rapidly becoming a confused mob. But Cromwell, with
numbers, ground, and generalship all in his favour, had made short
work of Langdale, and was able both to scatter the reserve, commanded
by Charles himself, and pour the mass of his forces on the
half victorious royalist foot in the centre. The king's centre was
now between the squadrons of Cromwell and the rallying battalions
of Skippon.  No infantry could resist such terrible odds; and the
Welshmen were soon seized with a panic and surrendered in droves.
Rupert retreated after the king. Of the royalist army none was
left save a part of the horse. The victors found in the pursuit the
king's secret despatches, and published to the world the damning
record of his intrigues with Papists and foreigners that he might
obtain the aid of a French or Irish army to put down his English
enemies.</p><p>

  20. While Charles's cause was becoming desperate in
England, the genius of Montrose had again created a
royalist party in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. Since
<date value="1639">1639</date> Argyll,
in his double character of Lowland Marquis
and Highland clan chieftain, had made himself
<note place="foot" n="50">Montrose in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, <date value="1644">1644</date>-<date value="1645">1645</date></note>
 the master of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, and was even thought to be
aspiring to the crown. The support of the bigoted Covenanting
clergy and middle-classes secured his preponderance among
the Saxons of the south, while the sharp broadswords
and cunning policy of the Campbell clan had given
him an absolute preponderance over the Gael in the
Western Highlands. But a strong reaction was now setting
in. In the Lowlands the lesser nobles and gentry
were sick of the Calvinistic tyranny, and disgusted at their
own powerlessness. In the Highlands the Macdonalds and
other once powerful clans were only prevented by mutual
jealousies from making common cause against the greedy
Campbells. Montrose now strove to bind together the
southern gentry and the discontented clansmen against
Argyll and his party.  Montrose was no friend of bishops
or of despotism. He had resisted Charles's earlier policy
and had drawn his sword to defend the Covenant. Now,
however, like Hyde in England, he believed that Charles
had become a constitutional king; and his ardent soul was
filled by lofty visions of loyalty to a just and lawful
monarch, ruling constitutionally through his faithful gentry,
and protecting his people from   the tyranny of an overmighty
subject and an inquisitorial and narrow-minded
kirk. Early in <date value="1644">1644</date> Montrose visited England and went
back a marquis and the king's lieutenant-general in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>.

 </p><p>He now resolved on a desperate venture, believing,
as he says in his own poem-
</p><p>
              <quote rend="blockquote"> "He either fears his fate too much,
                   Or his deserts are small,
                 Who dares not put it to the touch,
                   And win or lose it all."</quote>

 </p><p> Failing to raise the gentry of Angus, Montrose betook himself to
the Highlands. He was perhaps the first Lowlander to discover the
military value of the fierce rush of the brave clansmen, but he found
the clans slow to move, distracted by feuds and jealousies, and hard
<note place="foot" n="52">The Highland Revolt.</note>
to unite. He succeeded, however, in bringing under
 his command a force of perhaps <date value="1500">1500</date> Macdonalds
from Antrim, commanded by Alister Macdonald, who,
after the cessation of the Irish war, had come back to their native hills
on an unsuccessful mission of vengeance against the Campbells.
These tried soldiers remained henceforth the one really indestructible
part of his army. But even with their help Montiose marched on
Perth with only 3000 footmen and no cavalry at all. On  <date value="1644-09-01">1st September1644</date> that little force swept before them the host of raw Covenanting
<note place="foot" n="53">Tippermuir</note>			.
militia that went out to Tippernuir to defend
the Lowland city. Perth at once surrendered, and
Montrose marched forthwith on Aberdeen, where, on 13th September,
he gained a second victory, that was followed by a pitiless massacre

of the defenceless townsmen. But the country refused
 to rise, and at the approach of winter Montrose was
forced again to take to the hills. This time he was received with wild
enthusiasm by the Macdonalds, and was soon surrounded by a great
army of the clans. Amidst the snows and storms of December, he led
the Macdonalds across the trackless hills that separated their valleys
from the Campbell country, where they wreaked their wild vengeance
on their cruel enemies. Argyll left his subjects to be butchered,
and managed, with a small force, to follow the Macdonalds on their
northward retreat, along the great chain of lakes where the Caledonian
Canal now runs. Montrose now learnt that an army under Lord Seaforth
blocked his further progress. He turned back on the Campbells,
and, on 2nd February <date value="1645">1645</date>, signally defeated them at Inverlochy,
<note place="foot" n="55">   Inverlochy</note>
underneath Ben Nevis, the cowardly Argyll watching
 from a boat the slaughter of his gallant followers.
Montrose now hoped that all <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> would be at his feet. In proud
anticipation of victory he wrote to Charles, " I shall come, with a
brave army, which will make the rebels in England as well as <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>
feel the just rewards of rebellion, only give me leave to say to you as
David's general did to his master, 'Come thou thyself lest this country
be called by my name.' "
</p><p>  In the early spring of <date value="1645">1645</date> Montrose, now joined by the great Gordon
clan, again invaded the eastern Lowlands and captured Dundee. But
<note place="foot" n="56">   The Invaion ofthe Lowlands. </note>
   the Highland host melted away as usual, and Montrose
had the utmost difficulty in retreating to the hills
  before the trained soldiers of Generals Hurry and
Baillie. However, in May he had again got an army together and utterly







<pb id="p.243" n="243"/>

defeated Hurry at Auldearn, near Forres. In July he defeated Baillie
at Alford on the Don. This led to a fresh invasion of the south. On
15th August, Montrose won his crowning victory over
Baillie at Kilsyth. Glasgow opened its gates, and
<note place="foot" n="57"> Kilsyth.</note>
<placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> at last seemed conquered.</p><p>
   Montrose was a practical soldier but a visionary politician. He
 could win victories, but he had too few sympathisers with his policy
 among the Lowland Scots for his victories to serve any permanent end.
 Within a few days all his hopes were destroyed. The mass of the
 people paid no heed to Montrose's policy of moderate Presbyterian
 royalism, and were indignant at the violence and brutality of his savage
 followers. The Highlanders went home after their wont, preferring to
 take back their booty to their native glens or to still further glut their
 vengeance against the Campbells. Of the victors of Kilsyth soon only
 500 Irish foot remained. To these was added a new force of about
 1200 cavalry, the lesser noblemen and gentlemen of
 the Border country, who alone had responded to his
 <note place="foot" n="58">   Philiphaugh.</note>
 appeals. Montrose hurried to join them amidst the rugged Border
 moorlands. David Leslie now came up with 4000 horse from the
 Scottish army in England. On 13th September he burst upon Montrose
 under the hill of Philiphaugh, on the long green meadow that
 lies beside Ettrick water. The southern gentry scattered in panic
 flight, but the 500 Irish veterans fought bravely to the last, and
 perished all but fifty, after a brave struggle against overwhelming
 numbers. The women and children, who had followed their wanderings,
 were barbarously put to death. Montrose again fled to the
 Highlands; but neither Macdonalds nor Gordons would follow a
 defeated and discredited leader. In
 <date value="1646-08">August1646</date> he crossed over to
 Norway. <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> was again dominated by the Covenanters.
</p><p>
   21. After Naseby the royalists were brought to bay; but
they still went on fighting with infinite spirit.   In the
summer of <date value="1645">1645</date> Charles marched
northwards, hoping to
join hands with Montrose, but his troops were defeated at
Rowton Heath near<placeName key="Chester">Chester</placeName>, and soon afterwards he heard
the news of the fatal disaster of Philiphaugh.    With the
failure of Montrose, Charles's last hopes of successful resistance fell to the ground. He returned to Oxford only to
receive intelligence of new misfortunes. Fairfax pressed
forward to the west, where Goring now
<note place="foot" n="59"> End of the English War,<dateRange from="1646" to="1647">1646-7</dateRange>.</note>
commanded the last royalist army.     In July
<date value="1645">1645</date> Fairfax defeated Goring at Langport,
and in September forced Rupert to surrender at Bristol.
For this submission Charles angrily dismissed his nephew
from  his service.  In March <date value="1646">1646</date>
the army of the west
capitulated to Fairfax. Oxford was now threatened. Save
for a few castles and fortresses, where chivalrous gentlemen
held out for glory rather than for victory, the whole of
southern Britain was in the hands of the combined forces
of the Scots and the New Model.
</p><p>






<pb id="p.244" n="244"/>             <note place="foot" n="60">[<date value="1647">1647</date>--<date value="1647">1647</date>
</note>
  Charles had now to choose between flight from the
country and surrender to his enemies. He chose the latter
course, and believing that the Scots were more likely to give
him good terms than the English, he resolved to submit
himself to the Scottish army, which was then besieging
Newark, the last of his midland strongholds to hold out.
In May <date value="1646">1646</date> he joined the
Scots camp at Southwell, and</p><p>
was promptly sent under honourable restraint to Newcastle.
  With the captivity of the king there seemed every reason
to hope for the final settlement of the two kingdoms. The
conditions of the settlement were, however, very difficult to
determine. Charles had hoped that the Scots would support
him against the Parliament. But the English Parliament
and the Scots remained of one mind. They jointly resolved
that they would restore Charles to the throne, only
if he agreed to take the Covenant, abolish bishops, and
surrender the militia for twenty years. Charles strongly
believed in Episcopacy, and could only be brought to
offer to accept Presbyterianism  for three years, hoping
that by that time he could play off the factions against
each other, and so avoid the disagreeable necessity of
sticking to his promise. Neither the Scots nor the Parliament
would accept this.  The Scots were so angry at
Charles's refusal of their terms, that they gladly agreed to
the proposal of Parliament that they should go home to
their country, on condition of receiving the large sums due
to them from the English. In
<date value="1647-01"> January1647</date> they crossed
the Border, leaving Charles behind in England. The Parliament
now removed him to Holmby House in Northamptonshire.</p><p>
  22. Fortune still favoured the fallen king. The strained
relations between the Presbyterian Parliament and the
Independent army still gave him good chances of obtaining
favourable terms. The Presbyterians, led by Denzil Holles,
  played into his hands by their unwise eagerness
<note place="foot" n="61">Parliament andthe Army, <date value="1647">1647</date>.</note>
 to get the better of the Independents.
They declared that the army should at once be disbanded,
as there was no longer any need for soldiers now that
peace had been restored. But they were so greedy to get
a reputation for economy, that they ignored the righteous
demand of the soldiers to receive in full their arrears of
pay, before they were got rid of. This false step for the
first time joined together the indifferent professional soldier
with the ardent fanatics and sectaries. The troops prepared
to resist the Parliament, and elected representatives to look







         <pb id="p.245" n="245"/>

after their interests. These were called the Agitators or
agents. After some hesitation Cromwell lent his all-powerful
support to their cause. In great fear of the army, the
Presbyterians patched up an agreement with the king,
on the terms which they had rejected in the previous
year, and called in the Scots to join hands with them in
restoring the monarchy. Hearing that there was a plot to
convey Charles away from Holmby, Cromwell sent Cornet
Joyce with a force of cavalry to secure for the army the
person of the king. On  <date value="1647-06-04">4th
June 1647</date> Joyce led away
Charles to Newmarket.</p><p>
  The Parliament was aghast at the abduction of the king,
and prepared to make war upon the army, with the help of
the Scots and the trainbands of Presbyterian London.
The Independent minority fled in alarm to the soldiers.
Thereupon the troops marched from their quarters near
Cambridge on the refractory capital.    On 7th August
London was occupied. Eleven of the Presbyterian leaders
of the Commons fled beyond sea in alarm. The army had
now both king and Commons at its mercy. But its leaders,
Cromwell and Ireton, were still anxious to avoid the appearance
of a military revolution, and hoped to win over the
king to their policy of toleration. They, therefore, offered
to Charles, who was now living at Hampton Court, a plan
for the settlement of the nation called the Heads of Proposals,
drawn up by Ireton, who was as ready with his pen
as with his sword.</p><p>
  The Heads of the Proposals provided that the king should be restored
on the following conditions: i. A Parliament should meet every two
years and sit a hundred and twenty days certain. 2.
Members should be returned to the Commons " according
to some rule of proportion," and "poor decayed
<note place="foot" n="62"> The Heads of the Proposals, <date value="1647-08">August1647</date></note>
or inconsiderable towns" should lose their representatives.
3. The power of the militia should belong to Parliament for
ten years. 4. The king's ministers should be appointed by Parliament
for the same period. 5. Bishops should lose their jurisdiction and
none be compelled to take the Covenant. 6. Liberty to worship God
in their own way should be given to all men except Papists. 7. A
general Act of Oblivion should be passed.
</p><p>
   Charles had now his last chance. The fanatical and
democratic army had offered him better terms than those
which the Presbyterians were willing to allow him. He
was offered freedom to worship God in his own way, provided
that he would allow a similar freedom to others.
Despite their professed hostility to monarchy, the army





<pb id="p.246" n="246"/>          <note place="foot" n="63"><date value="1648">1648</date>--<date value="1649">1649</date></note>

leaders were willing to continue him as their king with as
much show of power as he was likely to have under the
schemes of the Presbyterians, to which he had given an
unwilling consent. Charles, however, was not clear-headed
enough to understand the complicated situation. Deceived
by the deference which Presbyterians and Independents
had in turns paid him, he still imagined that he was strong
enough to do without either. His whole policy was still to
balance the two sections of his enemies against one another.
Accordingly he now rejected the Heads of the Proposals,
and again entered into secret negotiations with the Scots.
This gave some show of reason to the contention of the
more violent of the soldiers, that no trust could be put in him.
They had objected to the Heads of the Proposals as too
favourable to the King. Now that he was again intriguing,
they clamoured for his trial as a traitor to the nation.
Cromwell again changed his mind and resolved to have no
more dealings with him. In great alarm Charles fled in
November to the Isle of Wight; but he was soon captured
and shut up, with more restraint than before, in Carisbrook
Castle. He still persisted in his old policy of intrigue and
secretly signed the Engagement with the Scots, promising
to set up Presbyterianism for three years in England, and
to put down the heresies that were rife among the troops.
At the same time he rejected the Four Bills sent up to him
by the cowed Parliament. Thereupon Parliament passed
in January <date value="1648">1648</date> a vote of No Addresses, in which they
solemnly renounced any further negotiations with him.
</p><p>  23. In the summer of <date value="1648">1648</date>, Presbyterians and Anglicans
joined in a common revolt against the army of sectaries
<note place="foot" n="64">The Second civil war,May-August,<date value="1648">1648</date>. </note>
and the self-seeking Parliament that registered
its will. But all was in disorder and confusion,
and no common plan or unity of
 purpose bound together the ill-assorted
coalition that now set on foot the Second Civil War. Popular
risings burst out in North and South <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>. The royalists
of the North seized Berwick and Carlisle. The Associated
Counties felt the stress of war for the first time, as revolts
broke out in Kent, Sussex, and <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>. A large part of
the fleet deserted the Parliament, and put itself under the
<persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName></persName>. But the undrilled loyalty of the insurgents
was no match for the veterans of the New Model. The
Parliament and army again united to meet the common
danger, and the country people were so sick of war, that
they held aloof from the gentry and townsmen that now






          <pb id="p.247" n="247"/>

called on them to arms. Even London gave no sign of
revolt. Fairfax drove the Kentish insurgents out of Maidstone.
A miserable remnant of them, under the Earl of
Norwich (father of the royalist leader, Goring), united with
the <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> rebels under Capel, Lisle, and Lucas. They were
soon driven to defend themselves with desperation behind
the strong walls of Colchester, which Fairfax closely
besieged. Cromwell put down the Welsh risings with stern
energy. The royalist fleet hesitated to strike a decisive
blow.</p><p>
   All now depended on the Scots. The party of the nobles,
 led by the Duke of Hamilton, now secured a majority in the
 Scots Parliament over the party of the ministers led by the
 Marquis of Argyll. Hamilton urged an invasion of England
 to save Charles from his enemies and carry out
 the Engagement. But the sterner Presbyterian Protesters
 still declared for peace, and though Hamilton and the
 Engagers crossed the Border at the head of a considerable
 army, the veterans of the Covenant refused to follow his
 standards, and the General Assembly denounced him as
 a friend of the uncovenanted king. The Scots troops
 united with the northern insurgents, and advanced to
 Preston. Here they were out-generalled by Cromwell, and
 signally defeated (17th Aug.). After a last vain stand at
 Winwick, the mass of the army laid down their arms at
 Warrington. A few days later, the defenders of Colchester
 were forced by famine to surrender to Fairfax. Lisle and
 Lucas were shot in cold blood on the spot. Other leaders
 of the revolt, including Capel and the Duke of Hamilton,
 were executed in March <date value="1649">1649</date>.
 The Second Civil War was
 at an end, and king and Parliament alike lay at the mercy
 of the soldiers, who believed that their triumph was by the
 special Providence of God.</p><p>
 24. The failure of the rebellion had revived the spirits of
 the Parliament, which renewed the negotiations with the
 king in what was called the Treaty of Newport.
 <note place="foot" n="65"> Pride's Purge andthe Execution ofthe King, <dateRange from="1648" to="1649">1648-1649.</dateRange></note>
 But the army had now lost all love of constitutional
 ways, and Cromwell had fallen in
 with their cry that Charles Stewart, "the man
 of blood," must be brought to justice.  On 6th Dec.,
 Colonel Pride went down to the House and drove out the
 Presbyterian members. The Independent minority, known
henceforth as the Rump, were but puppets in the hands of
the soldiers. On 1st Jan. <date value="1649">1649</date>,
they voted that a High
Court of Justice should be set up to bring Charles to trial






<pb id="p.248" n="248"/>    <note place="foot" n="66"> <date value="1649">1649</date>-</note>

The little handful of Independent peers that now formed
the House of Lords refused to agree to this; but the
Commons declared that, as representatives of the people,
they had power to act alone. Every legal and constitutional
obstacle was brushed aside by Cromwell, who, when he had
made up his mind how to act, had a supreme contempt for
forms. "I tell you," he now declared, "we will cut off the
king's head with the crown upon it." On 19th Jan., Charles
was brought before the High Court of Justice, on which,
however, barely half of the appointed members consented
to act. Fairfax himself was among the absentees. With
the quiet dignity that seldom failed him, Charles refused to
plead before the unlawful tribunal, urging that no subject
had a right to sit in judgment on his sovereign. After a
mockery of a trial, he was condemned to death as a murderer
and traitor to the Commonwealth. On 27th Jan., the
President, John Bradshaw, pronounced the sentence in
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> Hall. On 30th Jan., Charles was led out to
die on a scaffold that was erected in front of Inigo Jones's
noble Banqueting House at Whitehall. He had taken a
touching farewell of his two youngest children, and of his
nephew the Elector Palatine, who alone of his kinsfolk
were with him at the last. The holy Bishop Juxon gave
him the last consolations of religion. The great throng of
sympathetic spectators were kept far from the scaffold by a
strong force of soldiers. <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>in a brief speech declared
that Parliament, and not he, was guilty of the Civil War,
and set forth his views of government. " For the people,"
said he, " I desire their liberty and freedom as much as
anybody whatsoever; but I must tell you that their liberty
and freedom consists of their having those laws by which
their lives and their goods are most their own. It is not
their having a share in the government; that is nothing
appertaining unto them." He then lay down, resting his head
on a low block. A masked executioner then did his work,
and holding the head on high, cried, " Behold the head of
a traitor." The troops dispersed the angry and horrorstricken
crowd. The patience and meekness of the king
made a lasting impression. His errors were forgotten in
his tragic death.  He was regarded as a martyr to the
Church and Constitution, and his memory was reverenced
with almost religious worship.</p><p>

15th  January drawn up and presented to Parliament
a scheme for the future constitution of
England, called the Agreement of the People.
  The Agreement of the People provided: That the existing Parliament
  should be dissolved. 2. Future Parliaments should be biennial and
 consist of four hundred persons, chosen by the different
<note place="foot" n="2">The Agreementof the people <date value="1649-01">Jan,1649</date></note>
shires and boroughs according to population, the
  smaller boroughs being disfranchised. 3. The
executive power should be in the hands of a Council of State
appointed by Parliament. 4. There should be a State church reformed
in a way "according to the Word of God," but with religious liberty
to all but " Papists and Prelatists." 5. Monarchy and the House
of Lords should be abolished.</p><p>
  Few Englishmen as yet fully realised that the Revolution,
  which was to bring liberty and progress, had ended
in the rule of the sword. The nominal guidance of the
nation rested with the Rump of the Long Parliament,
which speedily made provision for the immediate carrying
on of the government by voting the establishment
of a Commonwealth, and by abolishing both the monarchy
and the House of Lords.     It also set up a Council
of State of forty-one persons to carry on the executive
government, as had been done of old by the king's
Privy Council. But the Rump, though seldom more
than fifty strong, continued to discharge the whole work
of Parliament. It quietly ignored the demand of the
officers, that it should dissolve and give way to a new
popularly elected Parliament, such as was provided for in
the Agreement of the People. It clung to power, not only
from love of rule, but because it knew that a free Parliament,
elected by a wide constituency, would soon make short work
of the new constitution, and bring back Church and king.
The political ideal of the Rump was, that England should be
ruled by a republican aristocracy, such as the States General
of the United Provinces or the Great Council of Venice. In
Church as in State, it aimed at making England a "mere
Amsterdam" by setting up that religious toleration which






  <pb id="p.251" n="251"/>

Anglican and Presbyterian alike regarded as the encouragement of error. The result of this was that the rigid
Presbyterian system, which had been formally set up in
<date value="1646">1646</date>, never became general
throughout England: though
in some parts, and particularly in London and Lancashire,
it had become completely established.</p><p>
  Troubles beset the new Commonwealth on every side.
The royalist cause had taken a new life with the death of
the king. Almost on the same day as Charles's execution,
a little book was published called Eikon
<note place="foot" n="3">The Royalist reaction and Eikon Basilike."</note>
Basilike, the Portraiture of his Sacred Majesty,
in his Solitude and Sufferings. Professing to "
contain the prayers and meditations of <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName> in his prison,
the book at once became extraordinarily popular. Though
really put together by a clergyman, John Gauden, it was
an article of faith with the royalists that it was written by
Charles himself. It passed through forty-seven editions,
and was widely and eagerly read. The Parliament, unable
to stop its circulation, employed the famous John Milton,
Latin Secretary to the Council of State, to write an answer
to it called Ikonoklastes. So anxious was the government
to justify its acts before European public opinion that it
also employed Milton to write defences of its action against
the attacks of the great scholar Salmasius. Another and
opposite danger came from the army, where the fanatical
Levellers, who wished for complete democracy
<note place="foot" n="4">The Levellers put down, <date value="1649">1649</date>.</note>
 and equality, arose in revolt against
the politic compromises of the reigning oligarchy, and
denounced, with bitter scorn, the half-hearted hesitation
of the army leaders, who now strove with all their might
to keep their wild followers back.  Cromwell was the
special object of their scorn. "You shall scarce speak
to Cromwell," said Lilburne, the Levellers' leader, "but
he will lay his hand on his breast, elevate his eyes, and
call God to record. He will weep, howl, and repent, even
while he doth smite you under the fifth rib." With true
instinct, they foresaw that Cromwell might make himself
king if he willed. "You have no other way to treat these
people," said Cromwell to the Council, "but to break them
in pieces. If you do not break them, they will break you."
Thus, the leader of the revolutionary party was already
posing as the saviour of society and the State from
anarchical fanaticism. He put down the mutinies which
the Levellers had stirred up among the soldiers. He saw
clearly that strong government must be upheld if the infant





<pb id="p.252" n="252"/>      <note place="foot" n="5"><date value="1649">1649</date>--<date value="1652">1652</date></note>
Commonwealth were to be preserved.       Not only was the
great mass of Englishmen sullen and discontented. <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>
and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> were bitterly hostile, and foreign powers were
rudely contemptuous of the new Government. With his
strong practical wisdom Cromwell saw that the Commonwealth
must be set up on a firm basis before the question
of its ultimate shape could be considered.     Thus it was
that for nearly five years the Rump was suffered to go on
ruling, while the army carried out its proper work of completing
the conquest of the three kingdoms and restoring
the credit of England abroad.</p><p>
2. The Irish Rebellion, which had begun in
<date value="1641">1641</date>, soon settled
down into a religious war between Catholics and Protestants, in which
 a common faith united both the old Norman aristocracy
<note place="foot" n="6"><placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>,  <dateRange from="1641" to="1649">1641-1649</dateRange>.</note>
 and the native Celts against Anglican Royalists
and Puritan Roundheads alike. But there were great
difficulties on both sides in keeping up such an alliance. The king's
lieutenant, James Butler, successively Earl, Marquis, and Duke of
Ormonde, the most able, powerful, and popular of Irish nobles, was
a strong royalist of the same stamp as his friend Hyde, who tells us how
Ormonde "sustained with wonderful courage and conduct and almost
miraculous success the rage and fury of the rebels." But in <date value="1642">1642</date>, the
outbreak of the Civil War prevented either king or Parliament sending
over a sufficient force to uphold the common cause. Thereupon the
insurgents held at Kilkenny a General Assembly of the Catholic Confederates.
This was in fact, if not in name, a national Parliament
of the Irish nation. It set up a Supreme Council to govern the
country, and appointed Owen Roe O'Neill its general-in-chief. It was
with the Confederate organisation that Charles, in <date value="1643">1643</date>, concluded the
Cessation, which left nearly all <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> in Catholic hands. Henceforth
a thin strip of coast line between the Wicklow Hills and the
Belfast Lough, with another district running inland from Cork, and
a few scattered garrisons throughout <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, alone acknowledged
Ormonde as King Charles's lieutenant. The position of the Confederates
was still further strengthened when, in
<date value="1645">1645</date>, Charles sent
the Catholic Earl of Glamorgan to <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> to win help for his declining
cause in England. The Confederates now made large demands, and
Glamorgan agreed to whatever they asked for.  By the famous
Glamorgan Treaty, Charles's agent recognised their right to use the
old churches for the Catholic worship, and restored the jurisdiction
and revenues of the Church to the Catholic clergy. The treaty was
discovered by the Parliament, and Charles disavowed any knowledge
of it. But though Charles at Oxford might repudiate such conditions,
they were, for the most part, faithfully carried out in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>. A Papal
Nuncio, named Rinuccini, now came from Rome to restore the Catholic
organisation as the best hope of setting up a united <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>. Ormonde,
as an Irish Protestant, was indignant at the prospect of the extirpation
of his creed, and in <date value="1647">1647</date> surrendered
Dublin to the able and enterprising
Puritan Colonel Michael Jones, and sailed over to England,
thus transferring from Royalist to Roundhead hands the almost



     <pb id="p.253" n="253"/>
hopeless task of upholding the Protestant supremacy. But the hollow
alliance between the Catholic lords and the native Irish now broke up
altogether. Rinuccini went back to Italy disgusted at the refusal of
the Catholic gentry to make themselves the instruments of the papal
policy. The breach between the two sections of the Irish Catholics
gave a fresh opportunity to the friends of the king. In
<date value="1648">1648</date> Ormonde
came back again and concluded an alliance between the scanty band of
Protestant royalists and the Catholic lords, by which the latter agreed
to support King <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>in return for toleration of their faith. After
the tragedy of the 30th of January, Ormonde proclaimed the young
<persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName></persName> as <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. The Puritan garrison of Dublin
maintained almost alone the cause of the Commonwealth.</p><p>
Cromwell was now sent to <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> by the Rump, with
a gallant force of his Ironsides, to wage a holy war against
the Popish and royalist alliance.   In
<note place="foot" n="7"> The Puritan Conquest of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>,<dateRange from="1649" to="1652">1649-1652</dateRange></note>
September he took Drogheda by storm, and massacred
the whole garrison, some 2500 strong,                    					 .
save a few captives spared for the more lingering agony of
slavery upon the sugar plantations of Barbadoes. "This
is the righteous judgment of God," he wrote, " upon those
barbarous wretches who have imbrued their hands in so
much innocent blood." In October the garrison of Wexford
incurred the same fate. Such brutal measures made the
rest of the work of conquest an easy task. The first campaign
conquered " a great longitude of land along the shore."
The next, in <date value="1650">1650</date>, opened up
the way to the subjection of all
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>. Cromwell now left the country. His successors,
Ireton and Ludlow, now restored Protestant and English
ascendency very much in the spirit of Strafford. The
Catholic worship was suppressed, and the scared natives
were even tempted to Puritan churches, such was their terror
of the dominant soldiery. The Celtic landholders lost their
estates, or were transferred into the inhospitable deserts
beyond the Shannon. Their lands were handed over to
Puritan veterans, who were willing to make their homes
in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, or sold to Undertakers, who promised to people
and till them.   In return, <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> again enjoyed sound
peace and strong government. Good justice was enforced
between man and man, and rapine and murder sternly
punished. Nevertheless, the hard and cruel rule of Cromwell
was ever looked upon with peculiarly bitter hatred in
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.</p><p>
3. The Scots, who had continued to uphold <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>.
to the day of his death, proclaimed <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. without
delay. But the young King of Scots was a needy and
frivolous exile, living mostly in Holland, where the Stadtholder,



<pb id="p.254" n="254"/>  <note place="foot" n="8"> <date value="1649">1649</date>--<date value="1650">1650</date></note>
 <persName key="William II">William II</persName>., the husband of his sister Mary, gave
him a kindly welcome, or in the Channel Islands, which still
  rejected the Rump. He was now about twenty
<note place="foot" n="9"><placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> under <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.,<dateRange from="1649" to="1651">1649-1651</dateRange>.  </note>
years old, with a good reputation for quickness
 of wit and an indifferent one for industry and
morals. It made little difference to him whether <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>
was governed by Argyll's partisans in his own name or in
that of his father.  To make Charles's nominal rule a
real one, Montrose, who was weary of exile,
<note place="foot" n="10">Montrose's Last Venture and Death, <date value="1650">1650</date></note>
hazarded another attempt at a royalist rising.
Early in <date value="1650">1650</date> he sailed to the Orkneys, and
thence to Caithness and Sutherland, hoping to raise the
northern clans ; but the little band which he had brought
with him from Holland and the Orkneys was too weak to
act alone, and there was no sign of a rising of the clans.
His followers were dispersed at Carbisdale on 27th April,
and he himself was soon afterwards handed over to the
government by a Highland chieftain and taken to Edinburgh.
The Scots could never forgive the soldier who had taught
the wild clansmen the secret of their strength. Parliament
passed an act attainting him as a traitor, and on 21st May
the high-souled warrior poet was hanged at the Market Cross,
dressed in a scarlet cassock. With him perished the last
hope of a Cavalier restoration in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. The young
king now saw that he must either take the Covenant or
remain in exile from Britain. He chose the less heroic
course. Charles now repudiated Montrose, and agreed to
the terms of the Scottish commissioners. He accepted
both the National Covenant and the Solemn League and
Covenant, promised to do nothing without the goodwill of
Parliament, and pledged himself to set up Presbyterianism
in England and <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> as well as <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. In
<date value="1650-06">June1650</date>
he landed at Speymouth, and in
<date value="1651-01">January1651</date> he was
crowned at Scone. But Argyll still ruled <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, and
Charles was little better than a prisoner. He was forced
to give up his friends Hamilton and Lauderdale through
Argyll's jealousy, compelled to listen to endless prayers and
sermons, and to bear with good grace the stern rebukes of
the clergy for his frivolity and godlessness. The Scots army
was got ready to restore monarchy and Presbytery south of
the Tweed.</p><p>
The Rump saw that the rule of <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName> in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> must
sooner or later lead to a restoration in England, and resolved
to expel him by force. Fairfax, though hating the
course things had taken, had still held on to his command,



  <pb id="p.255" n="255"/>
and (though a peer since <date value="1648">1648</date>
by his father's death) had
accepted a seat in the House of Commons. He now threw
up his commission, believing that "human
probabilities were no sufficient grounds for
<note place="foot" n="11">Cromwell Captain General, <date value="1650-06">June1650</date>.</note>
makingwar upon a neighbour nation,especially
our brethren of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> to whom we are engaged in a
Solemn League and Covenant." He retired to his house at
Nun Appleton in <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName>, amusing his leisure by literature
and collecting coins and engravings. Cromwell was now
in name as well as fact Captain General of all the Commonwealth's
armies.  "I have not sought these things,"
he declared. "Truly I have been called unto them by the
Lord." In July <date value="1650">1650</date> he
invaded <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> with 16,000 men.</p><p>
David Leslie, who now commanded the Scots army, held
a strong position outside Edinburgh.  Late in August
Cromwell, who had failed to dislodge him,
was forced to retreat to Dunbar to wait reinforcements.
<note place="foot" n="12">Battle of Dunbar,<date value="1650-09-03">3rd Sept.1650</date>.</note>
 Leslie followed and encamped upon the hills
above Dunbar.   Cromwell's position was very difficult.
"The enemy," he wrote, "hath blocked up our way at the
pass of Cockburnspath, through which we cannot get without
almost a miracle." But the Scots rashly went down from
their post of vantage, and exposed their right wing to their
watchful foe. On 3rd September, as the sun was rising on
the sea, Cromwell led a flank attack on the enemy's right,
exclaiming, " Let God arise and his enemies be scattered."
At the same time the main body of the English army
engaged with the Scots in front. Attacked upon two sides
at once, the Scots army fell into hopeless confusion and
sustained a crushing defeat. Before the close of the year
all southern <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> had submitted to the English conqueror.</p><p>
In <date value="1651">1651</date> Cromwell again took the field against Leslie,
who was entrenched near Stirling. His lieutenant, Lambert,
succeeded in turning the Scots' position by a flank
attack through Fife. This left open the way to the south,
and Leslie, seeing that <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> was as good as lost,
resolved to invade England, hoping to stir up a royalist
and Presbyterian revolt. <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. accompanied Leslie
in his daring adventure, and great things were hoped for
when the son of the Martyr appeared on English soil. But
the English were sick of war, and had no confidence in a
king who came at the head of a Scots' army.  Cromwell
followed steadily in the rear, with ever increasing numbers.
At last, on 3rd September <date value="1651">1651</date> (a year after Dunbar),



<pb id="p.256" n="256"/>    <note place="foot" n="13"><date value="1651">1651</date>--<date value="1653">1653</date>.]</note>
the King of Scots stood at bay at Worcester, with scarcely
13,000 men. Cromwell, with more than 30,000, surrounded
<note place="foot" n="14">Battle of Worcester, <date value="1651-09-03">3rd Sept.1651</date>.</note>
the royalist positions, and had little difficulty
in thoroughly defeating the foe. "The dimensions
of this mercy," he wrote, "are above my
thought. It is for aught I know a crowning mercy." The
remnant of the Scots army made off as best it might.
The King of Scots, after romantic adventures and hairbreadth
escapes, made his way to Brighton, whence, forty
days after the battle, he succeeded in escaping to<placeName key="France">France</placeName>.
The subjection of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> was soon completed. Argyll
himself was besieged for nearly a year in his castle at Inverary,
but at last surrendered, agreeing that <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> should
be made a commonwealth with England, without king or
House of Lords.   He now lost all influence, and was
"drowned in debt and public hatred." The Presbyterian
clergy lost their power, and saw their Assemblies suppressed.
An English garrison kept the Scots from revolt. The three
kingdoms now lay at Cromwell's mercy.  His thoughts
could not but be directed on his future, "What if a man,"
he now asked, "should take upon himself to be king?"</p><p>
4. The foreign difficulties of the Commonwealth were
grappled with the same strong hand by which their domestic
foes had been discomfited. At first no foreign court would
   acknowledge the new-fangled Commonwealth,
 and English agents were murdered at the
 Hague and at Madrid. In <date value="1650">1650</date> <persName key="William II">William II</persName>.
<note place="foot" n="15">The Navigation Act, <date value="1651">1651</date>,
andthe War with the united Provinces, <dateRange from="1652" to="1653">1652-1653.</dateRange> </note>
of Orange died, whereupon the Stadtholdership
was abolished in Holland, and the aristocratic
faction of rich merchants became supreme in the
States General of the Seven United Provinces. But the
new rulers were as hostile as was the House of Orange
to the English Commonwealth, hating the English as
rivals in trade. The Rump did not shrink from their
hostility, and in <date value="1651">1651</date>
threw down the gauntlet by passing
the Navigation Act, which prohibited Dutch vessels from
bringing any goods to England, except the scanty products
of their own small land. All goods were to be henceforth
imported in English ships, or in vessels of the country to
which the cargo belonged. This aimed a deadly blow at
the carrying trade, which was the chief source of the
mercantile prosperity of the Seven Provinces. The result
was a bloody maritime war between the two republics.
For the Dutch war a great leader was found in the new
"general at sea," Robert Blake (<dateRange from="1599"
to="1657">1599-1657</dateRange>), a Bridgwater



  <pb id="p.257" n="257"/>
merchant's son, of short and ungainly figure, but of lofty
courage, strong will, and matchless resourcefulness and
energy, who had distinguished himself during
the Civil War by his heroic defence of
<note place="foot" n="16">  Blake</note>
Taunton, and since <date value="1649">1649</date>
had chased Prince Rupert with
his squadron of revolted ships of war from the sea, and had
conquered the Scilly Islands and Jersey, the last refuges
of the royalist cause. At first the Dutch fleet, the most
famous in Europe, triumphed over the raw English navy by
reason of its superior seamanship and the greater tactical
skill of its admiral Tromp, who won a hard fought fight
on 29th November <date value="1652">1652</date>, off
Dungeness. But in February <date value="1653">1653</date>
Blake turned the tables on the Dutch by a
victory off Portland, won by sheer hard hitting, despite
gross blunders in tactics on the part of the English admiral.
However, one glorious day was not enough to put an end to
the naval supremacy of Holland, and both fleets continued
to hold the sea on nearly equal terms. Such a struggle was
infinitely creditable to the energy and careful administration
of the Rump, and especially to Sir Harry Vane, the
manager of the navy and a hot Commonwealth's man.
Yet it did little to postpone the day of reckoning for the
narrow oligarchy.</p><p>
5. High taxes at home made the Commonwealth generally hated.
The royalist malignants were gradually stripped
of their estates, the luckiest among them
preserving part of their lands by paying a
<note place="foot" n="17">Fall of the Rump, <date value="1653">1653</date>.</note>
heavy composition that drained dry their resources. An
excise after the fashion of Holland, that had been imposed
for the first time in <date value="1643">1643</date>,
became a permanent tax. The
Parliament was, however, so successful on every side
that it was convinced that its continued rule was indispensable
to the wellbeing of the Commonwealth, and
it was so well satisfied with what it had done that it
grew sluggish in the cause of reform.  Now that the
fighting was over, the politicians in the victorious army
again busied themselves with affairs of state. They saw
with disgust the rulers of the Commonwealth more intent
on getting places for their kinsfolk than in bringing about
the golden age of godliness and freedom. Against the
aristocratic ideals of the ruling oligarchy, the soldiers set
up their policy of democratic reform and complete religious
liberty, and clamoured for a constitution based on the
Agreement of the People. Parliament now had before it a
project of reform, which Sir Harry Vane had introduced,



<pb id="p.258" n="258"/>  <note place="foot" n="18"> <date value="1653">1653</date>.
-<date value="1653">1653</date></note>
by which the danger of a fresh general election was to be
remedied by choosing new members for the seats left vacant
by Pride's Purge and the other "purifications" of the
Commons. The existing members of the Rump were,
however, to continue to sit, and would naturally pass judgment
on the qualifications of the new members, so that it
was merely a scheme for filling up vacancies in the House,
subject to the approval of the present members. Disgusted
at this new device for perpetuating its power, Cromwell,
who had long watched with impatience the procrastination
of the majority, now again called upon his
soldiers to strike a blow against his fellow members. On
20th April <date value="1653">1653</date> he
rose in his place in Parliament and
spoke sharply of their injustice and self-seeking.  "We
have had enough of this," he fiercely cried. " It is not fit
that you should sit here any longer." A band of trusty
musketeers drove the trembling Commons out of their own
House. Thus fell the scanty remnant of the Long Parliament,
unhonoured and unlamented. The remorseless persistence of
Cromwell trampled out the last traces of constitutional government.</p><p>
6. The only power now left was that of the army and its
general.  Some men hoped that Cromwell would bring
<note place="foot" n="19">The Little Parliament, <date value="1653">1653</date></note>
back the King of Scots : others that he would
summon a Free Parliament: others that he
would make himself king. His portrait crowned was set
up in the London Exchange with the inscription
<quote rend="blockquote">"Ascend three thrones, great Captain and divine,
I' th' will of God, old Lion, they are thine ! "</quote>
But Cromwell, with all his fanatic zeal for God's kingdom
had a clear eye to the future, and a strong dislike to the
naked rule of the sword.  Though willing to grasp at
power, he desired to clothe his power with legal forms.
Hesitating to summon a free Parliament lest the royalists
should be in a majority, he gathered together an assembly of
"persons fearing God, and of approved fidelity and honesty"
all selected by himself. In July he opened his Parliament of
nominees, telling them that they had been chosen, because
they were godly, as the future rulers of England. This let
loose the worst spirits of fanaticism and revolution. The
packed assembly declared that the new Commonwealth
wanted neither priests nor lawyers, and demanded the abolition
of tithes (which were still levied by the Puritan clergy
that were in legal possession of every benefice in England),


     <pb id="p.259" n="259"/>
and the destruction of the Court of Chancery. Whether
designedly or not, Cromwell had shown to all men what possibilities
of further revolution still lurked in the minds of the
extremer sectaries. The strange turn of events now made
him the only champion of order and of what was left of the
historical institutions of England. This was seen even by a
party within the convention of fanatics. On 11th December
the moderate minority met together in a hurry and declared
the assembly at an end.      In derision men called it the
Little Parliament or the Barebones Parliament, from       an
Anabaptist leather-seller who sat in it as a representative
of the City of London, and bore the name of Praise-God
Barbone.</p><p>
7. The Little Parliament made over its power to Cromwell.
On I6th December the council of officers drew up
the conditions of his rule in a document called the Instrument of Government.
</p><p>This provided: I. That England, <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, and <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> should
be strictly united under the same government and the same Parliament.
2. That the supreme authority should belong
<note place="foot" n="20"> The Instrument  of Government,<date value="1653">1653</date>, and the Limited Protectorate, <dateRange from="1653" to="1657">1653-1657</dateRange>.</note>
to the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth with a
Parliament of one chamber to meet every three years.
3. That the Parliament be composed of 400 members
for England, <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>, and the Channel Islands, and
30 each from <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> and <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, chosen according to a scheme of
representation according to numbers, by which <placeName key="Middlesex">Middlesex</placeName> returned
12, <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName> 22, and Lancashire 8 members, the small boroughs
being disfranchised. 4. That all possessing estate of the value of
&#x00A3;200 should be electors in the counties, unless they be Papists or hav
fought against the Parliament. 5. That the Lord Protector have the
executive power, subject to the advice of a Council of State, nominated
at first in the Instrument, but finally to be chosen from a list sent by
Parliament. 6. That Parliament have the sole power of making laws,
no veto being reserved to the Protector, though the Protector and
Council were allowed to make ordinances that retained the force of law
unless Parliament definitely rejected them, but that no Parliament have
power to make laws contrary to the Instrument. 7. That an ordinary
revenue for life be secured to the Protector, but that all extraordinary
grants were to be made by Parliament. The general result was to set
up a sort of strictly limited monarchy and a strictly limited Parliament,
mutually dependent on each other, so as to prevent the danger of either
party becoming supreme; while the authority of the fundamental law
itself prevented further revolutions. The Instrument was the first of
the written or paper constitutions of modern times.</p><p>
8. For the rest of his life Cromwell ruled England. He
at once set to work to restore law and order by a vast
series of ordinances. The union of the three kingdoms



<pb id="p.260" n="260"/>     <note place="foot" n="21"><date value="1653">1653</date>--<date value="1656">1656</date></note>
was now completed. <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> received the advantages
of free trade with England and the abolition of the courts
of the feudal lords, while in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> the work of
<note place="foot" n="22">The Domestic Government of  Cromwell, <dateRange from="1653" to="1658">1653-1658.</dateRange></note>      														        colonisation was pressed on,and both countries
 became prosperous under his hard just
    rule.    In England Cromwell mainly busied
himself with the settlement of the Church. He resolved to
keep up tithes and the parochial clergy, and he set up a
board of Triers to inquire into the good life and sound
doctrine of all persons nominated by the patrons to benefices.
All Puritans were equally eligible to hold office in
<note place="foot" n="23">Cromwell's StateChurch.</note>
Cromwell's comprehensive State Church. "Of
 the three sorts of godly men," he boasted,
"Presbyterians, Baptists, and Independents, though a
man be of any of these three judgments, if he have
the root of the matter in him, he may be admitted."
Even the old clergy were not disturbed if they abstained
from reading the Prayer Book and engaged to be faithful
to the existing government. This policy of toleration
was a great step in advance, being the only way of
settling the religious difficulties which arose from the
multiplication of sects and schools of opinion.  Few,
however, were satisfied with it. The Independents and
Anabaptists were no longer the extreme representatives of
the sectaries. In the religious confusion that followed the
Civil Wars a swarm of new and strange sects had risen
up, such as the Fifth Monarchy Men, who believed in the
immediate Second Coming of Christ. Moreover, George
Fox had begun his protests against Puritan dogmatism by
preaching the importance of the inner light of the individual
conscience, and his followers, the Society of Friends
or Quakers, as they were called, were an earnest and
increasing body. To enthusiasts such as these Cromwell's
State Church seemed a mere politic compromise with worldliness.
The exclusion of " Papists" and " Prelatists" from
the enjoyment of the toleration, on the ground that their
opinions were superstitious and dangerous to the State, cut
off the bulk of the nation from the benefits of the religious
peace. The ejected clergy and their followers, happy if
the lax execution of the laws sometimes allowed them to
meet together and worship according to the Prayer Book
in some secret place, looked upon the Cromwellian settlement
as the perpetuation of religious anarchy. Ordinances
against cock-fighting, horse-racing, swearing, showed the
strictness of the new ruler. Cromwell also endeavoured to



  <pb id="p.261" n="261"/>
reform the law-courts, especially the Court of Chancery.
Considering the narrow basis of his rule, he carried out a
wonderful series of improvements.</p><p>
On  <date value="1654-09-03">3rd Sep.1654</date>,
the Protector met his First Parliament.
The members believed that they ought to possess all the
sovereign powers of the old Parliaments under
the monarchy, and at once set to work to
<note place="foot" n="24">Cromwell's First Parliament, <date value="1654">1654</date>.</note>
criticise and amend the Instrument of Government. This
Cromwell would not allow; for if the nation, as represented
in Parliament, were allowed the power of choosing freely
its form of government, the whole edifice of his power and
the domination of the Puritan bigots would have quickly
been brought to an end. All that he would allow was the
right to act in the way he suggested. He required every
member of Parliament to declare in writing his acceptance
of the Instrument, and refused to allow the recalcitrants to
sit any longer. But even the purged Parliament went on
with the work of constitutional reform, so Cromwell in great
disgust dissolved it.</p><p>
Cromwell now threw over all pretence at constitutional
rule, and showed the nation that a Protector governing by
military force could be an infinitely more
despotic ruler than Charles or Strafford. He
<note place="foot" n="25">The Major- Generals, <date value="1655">1655</date>.</note>
levied taxes without Parliamentary grant, and turned out
the judges who seemed likely to declare resistance to his
impositions legal. Availing himself of a widespread royalist
conspiracy, and of an actual Cavalier rising in Wiltshire,
where a gentleman named Penruddock, with a following
of two hundred horsemen, seized Salisbury and imprisoned
the judges on circuit, Cromwell divided England into ten
large districts, setting over each a Major-General to rule
by martial law and uphold the Protectorate with a strong
and unscrupulous hand.  The nation which refused to
accept him as a constitutional monarch now learnt to obey
him in his true character of a military despot.</p><p>
9. In  <date value="1656-09">Sept.1656</date>,
the expenses of his foreign policy
forced Cromwell to summon his Second Parliament, in
which he prevented the renewal of the action
of his First Parliament, by refusing to allow all
<note place="foot" n="26"> Cromwell's second Parliament,<dateRange from="1656" to="1657">1656-1657</dateRange>.</note>
those members, who were notoriously opposed
to his policy, to take their seats. The remainder granted
him large supplies, and declared plots against his life
high treason, but they refused to legalise the rule of the
major-generals, whom Cromwell consequently withdrew.
It was thought that his position would be made easier, if



<pb id="p.262" n="262"/>    <note place="foot" n="27"><date value="1657">1657</date>--<date value="1659">1659</date></note>
the government were reorganised more on the lines of the
ancient constitution. There had long been a wish among
Cromwell's personal friends that he should make himself
king, as the best chance of securing the permanence of his
power. As Waller sang-</p><p>
<quote rend="blockquote">" Let the rich ore forthwith be melted down,
And the state fixed by making him a crown,
With ermine clad and purple, let him hold
A royal sceptre made of Spanish gold."</quote>
Accordingly, in March <date value="1657">1657</date>,
Parliament presented to the
Protector the Humble Petition and Advice.
This was a new project for a paper constitution, which aimed at
restoring the old constitution so far as was possible. By it Cromwell
was asked: I. To take on himself the title of king
<note place="foot" n="28">The Petition and Advice, <date value="1657">1657</date>.</note>
with power of nominating his successor. 2. To summon
in future Parliaments, consisting of two houses, every
three years at least: the Lower House in future was to be called the
House of Commons, while the lords who sat in the Other House (this
was its title) were to be nominated by the Protector for life. 3. To
accept a yearly revenue of L1,300,000 for life; of which L1,000,000 was
to go to the support of the army and navy. 4. To allow the Council
of State to be directly nominated by Parliament. 5. To secure l</p><p>iberty
of conscience to all but Papists, Prelatists, and blasphemers.
A great clamour arose among the Republicans in the army,
whose faith had already been sorely tried by Cromwell's
limited Protectorate, and who were now horror-stricken at
the prospect of his becoming a king like Charles Stewart.
Cromwell gave way, declaring that though he liked well the
Petition, he could not offend his old followers by accepting
a title which they abhorred.    In May, the Parliament
removed the name of king from the Petition, and substituted
that of Lord Protector. In this form, Cromwell accepted the
whole Petition. In June he was installed for a second time,
clad in purple and ermine, and with something of royal
state. But he found that his troubles with Parliament were
in no wise abated by this new accession to his dignity.  In
Jan. <date value="1658">1658</date>, his Second Parliament met for a second session.
Cromwell did not this time venture to renew the exclusion
of his opponents, while his most faithful followers were
removed to the "Other House." This gave the Commonwealth's
men (so the Republican party was styled) a
majority in the Commons. They refused to recognise the
new House of Lords or to transact any business with them.
In February, Oliver dissolved Parliament in disgust, telling



   <pb id="p.263" n="263"/>
the members of the Commons that they were playing the
garne of the King of Scots, and calling on the Lord to judge
between them and him. He was now fully conscious of
the failure of his policy at home. " I would have been
glad," he lamented, " to have lived under my woodside, to
have kept a flock of sheep, rather than undertake such a
government as this." For the last years of his life he was
in daily danger of assassination from fanatical royalists or
enthusiastic sectaries.</p><p>
10. Force formed an uneasy basis for his civil dominion,
but abroad the strong arm of Oliver showed the princes
of Europe that England was a power to be
<note place="foot" n="29"> Cromwell's Foreign Policy, <dateRange from="1653" to="1658">1653-1658</dateRange>.</note>
dealt with. Even royalists were proud of the
vigorous and successful foreign policy of the
Usurper. His victories in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> first taught
foreign statesmen to realise the might of the new Republic.
Yet his view of the principles of English policy was little
more than a remembrance of the traditions of the age of
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>.  He wished to bind the Protestant powers
together in an Evangelical League. Thus he would secure
the dominion of the godly abroad as well as at home.</p><p>
In <date value="1654">1654</date>, Cromwell made
peace with the United Provinces,
the Dutch accepting the Navigation Act, and privately
promising to exclude the House of Orange
<note place="foot" n="30">Peace with the Dutch, <date value="1654">1654</date>.</note>
from authority. Other treaties with Denmark
and Sweden followed. These were the first steps towards
the union of the Protestant powers. But Cromwell soon
found that the age of the Counter-Reformation was past,
and that politics no longer depended on the struggle of
Protestant against Catholic.  Protestant states, like
Sweden and Denmark, or England and Holland, that were
rivals for dominion or trade, hated each other worse than
they hated the Papists, and the two great Catholic powers,
France and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, were deadly foes to each other. In
fact, European policy then centred round the continued
rivalry of<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, whose hostility to each
other was so deep-rooted, that the two kingdoms found it
impossible to join in the Peace of
 Westphalia, but continued at war until <date value="1659">1659</date>.

seriously to work to crush her decaying rival.<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> alike competed eagerly for the English alliance; and
after long hesitation, Cromwell decided to join the French.
The vision of an Evangelical League was soon to be
dimmed by the stern facts of experience: but the French
alliance was largely chosen on the ground that <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> was
more bigoted in its Catholicism than<placeName key="France">France</placeName>. This was clear
when Mazarin interfered to force the Duke of Savoy (<date value="1655">1655</date>)
<note place="foot" n="33">The Vaudois protected, <date value="1655">1655</date>.</note>
to cease from persecuting his Protestant subjects,
the Vaudois of the Alpine valleys, on
whose behalf the Protector had used his utmost exertions,
and for whom the poet John Milton, still Latin Secretary
of the Council of State, had written the most sublime of
his sonnets:</p><p>
<quote rend="blockquote">"Avenge, O Lord,
Thy slaughtered saints, whose bones
Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold,
Even them who kept Thy truth so pure of old,
When all our fathers worshipp'd stocks and stones."</quote></p><p>
Moreover Cromwell had a keen eye to trade, and saw in
the Spaniards the most dangerous rivals of English Puritanism
in its new home in America. Accordingly he sent out
two fleets in <date value="1654">1654</date>, one of
which under Blake restored the
<note place="foot" n="34">Naval Exploit of Blake and Penn <dateRange from="1654" to="1657">1654-1657</dateRange>.</note>        											 terror of the British name and the security of
 British commerce in the Mediterranean, while
the other, under Penn and Venables, was sent
to the West Indies. Even before the alliance with<placeName key="France">France</placeName> in
<date value="1655">1655</date>, English seamen
had revived the most daring traditions
of the Elizabethan age in the remote waters of the Caribbean
Sea. "Remember," wrote Cromwell to Penn, "that the
Lord Himself hath a controversy with your enemies, even
with that Romish Babylon of which <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> is the great
under-propper." Penn failed to take San Domingo, but
captured the important island of Jamaica; while Blake's
officers spoiled the Spanish treasure ships, and in <date value="1657">1657</date>
Blake himself won the last and most brilliant of his victories
by the total destruction of the Spanish West India fleet at
Santa Cruz in Teneriffe, though the Spaniards were moored
close ashore and protected by the strong castle and a
numerous land force. "We had not above fifty slain outright,"
wrote the admiral, "and the damage to our ships
was such that in two days' time we indifferently well repaired
for present security." But on the voyage home Blake died,
worn out by the fatigues and hardships of his command.
He was our greatest admiral before Rodney, Hawke, and



  <pb id="p.265" n="265"/>
Nelson, and the founder of our continuous naval greatness.
Though reared in the storms of civil war, he recked nothing
of politics, but fought with singleminded honesty for the
glory of his country. " It is not for us," he is reported to
have said, "to mind state affairs, but to keep foreigners
from fooling us."</p><p>
In <date value="1657">1657</date> Cromwell made a
defensive and offensive alliance
with<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, and sent over 6000 foot to join the French in
an attack on Spanish <placeName key="Flanders">Flanders</placeName>. The allies
captured Mardyke, and in <date value="1658">1658</date>, won the
<note place="foot" n="35">War with <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>,  <dateRange from="1657" to="1659">1657-1659</dateRange>.</note>
battle of the Dunes, after which Dunkirk surrendered. Both
Mardyke and Dunkirk were handed over to the English as
their share in the spoil of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. Cromwell's timely intervention
decided the fate of the war. In
<date value="1659">1659</date> <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> was
forced to make the Treaty of the Pyrenees, by which she
yielded Roussillon and Artois to<placeName key="France">France</placeName>. This step marks
the beginning of the French preponderance in Europe.
When, in <date value="1661">1661</date>, Louis XIV.,
on the death of Mazarin, took
upon himself the direct government of his dominions, he
had no foe to fear either at home or abroad.  In contributing
to build up the overweening power of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, the
Protector did a bad service to the interests of England
and the liberties of Europe. Yet his policy, though mistaken
in conception, was so vigorous and successful in
execution, that after ages have agreed that he nowhere
showed his greatness more fully than in his revival of the
power and glory of England amidst the nations of Europe.</p><p>
11. Worn out with constant cares and weakened by
perpetual sickness, Cromwell's health had long been precarious.
In August <date value="1658">1658</date>
he lost his favourite daughter,
Mrs. Claypole, and soon after was smitten with a tertian
ague. On 2nd September a great storm raged
over England. Oliver died the next day, 3rd
<note place="foot" n="36"> Death and Character  of Cromwell,<date value="1658">1658</date></note>
September, the anniversary of Dunbar and
Worcester. He was buried at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> among the
kings and with a more than regal solemnity.</p><p>
Cromwell was a man of "great and majestic deportment
and comely presence," "his head so shaped as you might
see it a storehouse and shop of a vast treasury of natural
parts." He had no affectation, and told Lely the painter
to paint his picture truly like him, "remarking all these
roughnesses, pimples, warts, and everything, otherwise I
will never pay you a farthing for it." He enjoyed hunting,
hawking, and horsemanship; was fond of a good voice and
of instrumental music, and not without a taste for the other



<pb id="p.266" n="266"/>   <note place="foot" n="37"><date value="1668">1668</date>--<date value="1659">1659</date></note>
arts, delighting to surround himself with learned men.
Though majestic and dignified on public occasions, he was
ever wont to unbend greatly with his intimates, amusing
himself by rough jokes, making doggrel verses, and
smoking tobacco. "He was not," as he himself boasted
"scrupulous about words or names or such things " and he
was stern and ruthless in carrying out the aims he had set
before him. " His temper," says one of his servants, " was
exceeding fiery; but the flame was soon allayed with those
moral endowments he had. He was naturally compassionate
towards objects in distress, even to an effeminate
measure." His private life was simple, loving, and pure.
He was sincerely and ardently religious, and, believing
that he was a " mean instrument to do God's people some
good," he brought himself to see in every prompting of his
ambition a means to further the kingdom of God. Hated
by royalists as a king-killer, and by republicans as an
apostate, his strong, stern, practical nature, ever enthusiastic
yet ever self-restrained, forced him step by step into
a position from which there was no escape but death. The
plain Huntingdonshire squire identified himself in his new
eminence with the interests of his country, in a way that
put to shame the whole line of the Stewarts. He taught
himself war and politics, when well advanced in middle life.
Yet in the field he shone as a great practical warrior, a
consummate leader of horse, and an unrivalled organiser of
victory; while in the cabinet he proved the most vigorous,
resourceful and inspiring of statesmen. There is something
pathetic in his constant endeavour to undo the work of his
own hands, and bring back England to her old ways under
his new house. He rose to supremacy through violence and
bloodshed, but he saved England from anarchy. He owed
his power to the sword, and the vast majority of Englishmen
hated his ideals both in Church and State, and would
gladly have been rid of him.  That under such circumstances
he could work out so much good, and stoop to so
little that was base or mean stamps him as one of the
greatest of Englishmen. Though his exploits were confined
to our little island, he is not unworthy to be put beside the
Caesars and Napoleons of history. It is his special glory
that among the great military despots of the world called
to power by a military revolution, he has the best claim
to be considered an honest man.  But it was well for
England that in the long centuries of her history she
numbers but one Oliver Cromwell among her rulers.</p><p>



  <pb id="p.267" n="267"/>
12. Oliver's eldest surviving son, Richard, was proclaimed
Lord Protector with as little difficulty as one king
succeeds another. He was thirty-two years
<note place="foot" n="38"> Richard Cromwell and the Fall of the Protectorate,<dateRange from="1658" to="1659">1658-1659</dateRange>.</note>
old, and had been brought up more as a private
gentleman than as the heir to a throne. His
friends describe him  as a "very worthy
person, of an engaging nature and religious disposition,
giving great respect to the best of persons, both ministers
and others." But he had neither religious nor political
enthusiasm, and was idle, easy-going, and indifferent. His
favourite pursuits were "hawking, hunting, horse-racing
with other sports and pastimes." But he was guided by
the wisdom and experience of Thurloe, Oliver's former
secretary, who hoped that his inoffensive character would
rally peaceful citizens in support of the new Protectorate.
Richard's younger brother Henry, a stronger and more
resolute character, continued to act as deputy of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>,
a post he had held since <date value="1655">1655</date>.</p><p>
At first all went well. "There is not a dog that wags
his tongue," boasted Thurloe, " so great a calm are we in."
In  <date value="1659-01">Jan.1659</date>, a new Parliament assembled. To make
the approach to the old constitution more complete, the
members were returned by the old constituencies, rotten
boroughs and all, though <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> and <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> still sent
their representatives. The Commons were, on the whole,
friendly to Richard, hoping to form an alliance with him
against the army. But the army was impatient at the
rule of a civilian who was not one of the godly.  The
soldiers sought to make themselves a state within the state
by procuring the nomination of Fleetwood, the Protector's
brother-in-law, as their general, with such exalted powers
that he was entirely free from the control of Richard and
Parliament. Richard, backed up by Parliament, refused
to do more than nominate Fleetwood Lieutenant-General
under himself as General. The soldiers knew that power
was in their hands, and were in no mood to give way to
peaceful magistrates. In April they frightened Richard
into deserting his friends in the Commons and dismissing
Parliament. "The chief officers would have left the Protector
a Duke of Venice [a nominal sovereign] for his
father's sake."  But the Republican spirit in the army,
kept down with difficulty by Oliver, now rose indignantly
against the rule of his sluggish son. Richard, who hated
the greatness that had been thurst upon him, refused to
struggle against it. On 25th May, he laid down his office.



<pb id="p.268" n="268"/>   <note place="foot" n="39">[<date value="1659">1659</date>--<date value="1660">1660</date></note>
He lived on in retirement till his death at a good old age
in <date value="1712">1712</date>.</p><p>
13. The soldiers had again shown their power, but they
knew not how to govern; and, in their zeal for republicanism,
<note place="foot" n="40">The Rump Restored, <date value="1659">1659</date>.</note>
they fell back upon the scanty remnant of the
Long Parliament, whose deposition in <date value="1653">1653</date>
had always been looked upon by the Commonwealth's men
as the overthrow of liberty. Even before Richard's retirement,
about forty members of the Rump again met together
at the invitation of the army. The pedantic little oligarchy
at once assumed all the dignity and importance of a regular
Parliament, declaring all the acts of the Protectorate null
and void, and loftily commanding the army to obey the
orders of lawful authority.  Disgusted alike at martial
law and sham republicanism, the people rose in revolt,
hoping to bring back the old king and constitution. But the
risings were nipped in the bud save in Cheshire, where Sir
George Booth of Dunham Massey, a Presbyterian of high
<note place="foot" n="41">The Royalist Revolt, <date value="1659">1659</date>.</note>
rank and an excluded member of the Long
Parliament, gathered the royalist gentry
around him, and seized upon<placeName key="Chester">Chester</placeName> itself. Lambert soon
marched against him, and on 19th Aug. scattered his
untried followers at Winnington Bridge, over the Weaver
near Northwich. The victorious army marched back to
London and turned out the Rump in October.</p><p>
14. Again the army sought to govern themselves, but
neither the ambitious Lambert, who had expelled the Rump,
nor the weak and irresolute Fleetwood, the
<note place="foot" n="42">The Failure ofthe Army Rule, <date value="1669">1669</date>. </note>
nominal General, had the strength to play
the part of another Oliver. The council of
officers was given up to fierce wrangles, while the people,
growing less afraid as they saw that the army without
Cromwell was but a rope of sand, began to refuse to pay
taxes. To prevent mere anarchy setting in, the officers
were forced, on 26th Dec., to allow the Rump again to
resume power.</p><p>
15. While the army leaders at London were paralysed
by indecision, the general of the force that kept <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>
in submission made up his mind to take
<note place="foot" n="43">Monck declaresfor a Free Parliament,<date value="1660">1660</date>.</note>
decided action. This was George Monck, a
silent, hard-headed, far-seeing soldier, who
was neither politician nor fanatic, and had of old served with
the king's forces in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, but, being taken prisoner at
Nantwich in <date value="1644">1644</date>, had entered into the service of the
Parliament, and had won Cromwell's esteem by his high



      <pb id="p.269" n="269"/>
military qualities. He now resolved to march upon London
with his troops, and set up a regular government.
On  <date value="1660-01-02">2nd Jan.1660</date>,
he crossed the Tweed into England.
Lambert, the strongest of the army leaders, sought to
oppose his progress, but his soldiers abandoned him
or made terms with the invaders.    Monck received a
cordial welcome on his southward march, and at York
was joined by Lord Fairfax. He reached London early
in February. On his arrival the Presbyterian City refused
to pay taxes to the Rump of sectaries, on the ground
that as their members had been excluded from the
House, there should be no taxation without representation.
Amidst the wildest scenes of popular delight, Monck made
common cause with the City. "I saw," wrote Pepys, the
government clerk, "many people give his soldiers drink
and money, and all along the streets cried, ' God bless them.'
At night the common joy was everywhere to be seen. At
Strand Bridge I could at one time tell thirty-one bonfires.
The butchers at the May Pole in the Strand rang a peal
with their knives when they were going to sacrifice their
rump. At Ludgate Hill there was one turning of the spit
that had a rump on it, and another basting of it. Indeed
it was past imagination both the greatness and the suddenness
of it." On 16th Feb., Monck formally declared for a
free and full Parliament to settle the future destiny of the
nation. He now forced the Rump to receive back the
members excluded in <date value="1648">1648</date>.
This gave a majority to the
moderate party, who at once voted a dissolution and ordered
new elections to be held. One of the last acts of the Long
Parliament was to appoint Monck general-in-chief of the
army.</p><p>
16. The King of Scots and his little court of exiles
watched with joy the restoration of popular sovereignty in
England, knowing well that it would bring
about the restoration of the king. To make
<note place="foot" n="44">The Declaration of Breda, <date value="1660">1660</date>.</note>
this easier, <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName> issued, on 4th April, the Declaration of
Breda.</p><p>
By this he promised: I. A general pardon to all, except such persons
as shall be hereafter excepted by Parliament. 2. That all questions
as to the lawfulness of the possession of the confiscated estates of
royalists by new owners be determined by Parliament. 3. That he
would consent to any Act of Parliament for the full satisfaction of the
arrears of pay to Monck's soldiers, and receive them into his service
on as good terms as they then enjoyed. 4. That "we do declare a
liberty to tender consciences, and that no man shall be disquieted for



<pb id="p.270" n="270"/>  <note place="foot" n="45"><date value="1660">1660</date>.</note>
differences of opinion in matters of religion which do not disturb the
peace of the realm," and that he was willing to accept any Act of
Parliament passed for that object.</p><p>
17. On 25th April the new Parliament met, the Commons
from England only, and chosen after the old fashion, and
<note place="foot" n="46">The Convention Parliament and the Restoration, <date value="1660">1660</date></note>
the Lords temporal, according to the old constitution,
but without the bishops, who had
been lawfully excluded by Act of Parliament.
As the Parliament was not summoned by royal
writs, after the lawful fashion, it was called the Convention.
Both Houses eagerly welcomed the Declaration of Breda,
which, by its full acknowledgment of the dependence of the
Crown on Parliament, had shown that the son was wiser
than his father had been. It voted that "according to
the ancient and fundamental laws of this kingdom, the
government is, and ought to be, by Kings, Lords, and
Commons," and invited Charles to come over and assume
his birthright. Thus was the Restoration effected amidst
universal goodwill.  It had been made necessary and
inevitable as the only alternative to military license. It
was, however, no mere reaction towards the bad old days
of personal government. Its earliest stage had been the
restoration of Parliament and popular rule. The first use
that Parliament made of its freedom was to bring back the
Monarchy and the other parts of the ancient Constitution.
The Restoration was not therefore the bringing back of
the Monarchy alone. The wholesome laws of the Long
Parliament, passed lawfully before the Civil War had begun
the baleful troubles that culminated in the rule of military
adventurers and fanatics, still remained the law of the land.
The king returned to restore the traditional freedom of
his country; and the one great break in the continuity of
modern English history had been ended by the bringing
back of the old Constitution.</p>

entered London. " He came," wrote John Evelyn in his
Diary, "with a triumph of 20,000 horse and
<note place="foot" n="1">TheRestoration, <date value="1660">1660</date>.</note>
foot, brandishing their swords and shouting
with inexpressible joy; the ways strewed with flowers,
the bells ringing, the streets hung with tapestry, fountains
running with wine; the mayor, aldermen, and companies
in their liveries, gold chains, and banners; lords clad
in cloth of silver, gold and velvet; the windows and
balconies well set with ladies; trumpets, music, and
myriads of people flocking, even so far as from Rochester."
" I stood in the Strand," continued Evelyn, "and blessed
God. And all this done without a drop of blood, and by
that very army which rebelled against him. It was the
Lord's doing. Such a restoration hath never been since
the return of the Jews from Babylon, nor so joyful a day
and so bright ever seen by this nation." But for the sullen
discontent of the Puritan officers, and the despair of the
sectaries, the new king was welcomed by all.</p><p>
It was no easy matter to restore the old constitution or
satisfy both the old Parliament's men, who had brought
back the king, and the old Cavaliers, who now came home
with him from banishment. Charles had been put on the
throne by a combination between the Presbyterians and
the old royalists, but the Presbyterians had taken the lead
in bringing about his return. As the men in power they
expected to be rewarded. But the ruined royalists called
for vengeance on all rebels, and loudly demanded their
lost estates. The Anglican bishops and clergy wanted the
Presbyterians and sectaries alike to be turned out of their
livings, and the property of the Church given back to its old
owners. The army cried out for its arrears of pay. The
king himself needed money badly.</p><p>
2. The Convention was now turned into a Parliament.
There were many Presbyterians in it who leant
<note place="foot" n="2">The work of the convention, <date value="1660">1660</date>.</note>
towards moderation, and the king was unwilling
to make enemies, and anxious to show
his good faith by carrying out strictly the
Declaration of Breda. The result was that the political
conditions of the Declaration were very soon made into law.

An Amnesty was granted, though the actual regicides and a
few others were excepted. Thirteen of those who had to
do with King Charles's trial were executed, including the
fanatical preacher, Hugh Peters, and Thomas Harrison,
the fiery Anabaptist general. As Harrison went cheerfully
to his doom, some enemy cried from amidst the crowd:
"Where is the good old cause now ?" " Here it is," he
replied, clapping his hand on his breast, " I am going to
seal it with my blood." Other regicides, like the intemperate
and bitter Henry Marten, were shut up in prison.
Many, like Ludlow, sought safety in exile. The bodies of
Cromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw were " dug out of their
graves in<placeName key=" Westminster Abbey,"> Westminster Abbey,</placeName> drawn to the gallows, and
there hanged and buried" ; " which, methinks," says Pepys,
" do trouble me that a man of so great courage as Oliver
should have that dishonour."  Even the remains of the
hero Blake were removed from the Abbey to the neighbouring
churchyard. The old Cavaliers were strong enough
to prevent an act being passed to confirm the sales of
royalist property made by the Long Parliament or Oliver.
Church, crown, and Cavaliers thus won back their confiscated
estates ; but most of the royalists who had compounded with
the former governments, or had sold their estates themselves,
got no relief. An Act of Indemnity and Oblivion
barred all their claims, and stopped those who regained
their lands from claiming arrears of rent. Parliament voted
Charles &#x00A3;1,200,000 a-year for life, and passed an Act (in this
following the Long Parliament) abolishing Military Tenures,
Purveyance and the oppressive Court of wards, giving
Charles an Excise tax on beer and liquors to be paid by
the whole nation, as a set-off to the feudal revenue,
hitherto levied from the landlords. The army was paid off
and disbanded, except about 5000 men, the beginning of
our modern standing army. These were retained because
of the alarm inspired by a rising of Fifty-monarchy men in
London, headed by a cooper named Venner. A few regiments
of regular soldiers might well prevent the fanatics
again snatching at power.  But the Cavaliers, hating
a standing army such as had upheld the despotism of
Oliver, would rather have had no troops at all. The steadfast
and God-fearing Puritan veterans soon settled down
in peaceful trades, and as a rule throve well in them.</p><p>
3. The Convention was dissolved in December, and in
May <date value="1661">1661</date> a strong Church-and-King Parliament was chosen
in its stead. It attacked the Amnesty. Though the king




<pb id="p.274" n="274"/>    <note place="foot" n="3">  <date value="1661">1661</date>--<date value="1665">1665</date></note>
and his ministers strongly upheld the indemnity, it insisted
on further examples of vengeance.  Vane and Lambert
<note place="foot" n="4">The Long Parliament of <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.
<dateRange from="1661" to="1679">1661-1679</dateRange>.</note>
were accordingly condemned as traitors. Lambert
got off with imprisonment in return for a
,sorry submission. Vane was beheaded. "On
the scaffold," says Pepys, " he changed not his
colour nor speech to the last, but died justifying himself
and the cause he stood for."</p><p>
With all its loyalty, the Cavalier Parliament (so it was
often called) was of one mind with the Presbyterian Convention
in upholding the great constitutional measures of
<date value="1640">1640</date> and <date value="1641">1641</date>.
All the ordinances passed by the Long
Parliament since <date value="1642">1642</date>, and all the proceedings of Cromwell's
Parliaments were regarded as null and void, since they
had never received the royal assent. Only two acts that
had received <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>.'s assent were now formally repealed.
One of these was the Triennial Act, though its principle
was again affirmed that Parliaments should not be intermitted
for more than three years. The other was the
Act excluding bishops from the House of Lords. Parliament
also passed resolutions denying some of the great
principles upheld by the Long Parliament after <date value="1642">1642</date>. It
declared that power over the militia rested exclusively with
the crown.  It also laid down that it was unlawful for
subjects to wage even defensive war against the king. The
great work of the new Parliament was to settle the affairs
of the Church. The surviving bishops went back to their

<note place="foot" n="5">The Restoration Settlement of the Church,
<dateRange from="1661" to="1665">1661-1665</dateRange></note>
sees. The empty bishoprics had already been
filled up. The pious and venerable Juxon, the
pupil of the martyred Laud, who had stood by
King Charles on the scaffold, became Archbishop
of Canterbury; but he was too old to take the first
place, and the real leader of the bishops was the able, cultivated,
and astute Gilbert Sheldon, a former friend of Falkland,
now Bishop of London, and soon Juxon's successor as
archbishop. " The clergy are so high," wrote Pepys, " that
all people I do meet with do protest against their practice."
But the Commons were hot on their side, and Charles
and his ministers, old Cavaliers as they mostly were, sought
in vain to teach moderation to angry men, smarting from a
deep sense of wrong, and eager for revenge. It was hopeless
to carry out Charles's Worcester House Declaration that
the Church should be so reformed as to make it better
liked by the Presbyterians.  Even the promise at Breda of
liberty for tender consciences could not be maintained,



     <pb id="p.275" n="275"/>
largely because Parliament knew that Charles desired that
any toleration granted should be extended to Roman
Catholics. The only attempt at reconciliation proved a
hopeless failure. In April <date value="1661">1661</date>
the Savoy Conference was
held at the Savoy Palace in the Strand between the
bishops and the Presbyterian leaders; but it only led to
greater ill-will on both sides. The bishops were not conciliatory,
and the high-minded but crochety Richard Baxter, the
Presbyterian leader, destroyed his case for moderate changes
by proposing to set up a new Prayer Book altogether. Before
the year was out the Corporation Act was passed, enacting
that all mayors, aldermen, councillors, and other borough
officers should receive the Holy Communion according to
the rites of the Church, take the oaths of Supremacy,
Allegiance, and Non-resistance, and abjure the Covenant.
In May <date value="1662">1662</date> the Act of
Uniformity was passed, requiring all
beneficed clergy to use the Prayer Book, which had now
been revised in ways that made it more distasteful to the
Puritans. By the Episcopal Ordination Act all holders of
livings were also required to be ordained by a bishop, or to
give up their cures. On St. Bartholomew's Day,
<date value="1662-08-24">24th August,1662</date>, nearly two thousand
honest ministers resigned their
benefices rather than accept the new settlement. They included
Presbyterians, Independents, and Baptists, and their
expulsion marks the last act of the Reformation, and the real
beginning of Protestant Dissent on a large scale. Hitherto
the mass of the Puritans had striven to bring about reforms
of the Church from within. Comprehension not toleration
had been their aim. That was no longer possible, so
that even the Presbyterians went out, hoping no longer
for domination, and expecting at the best some toleration
for their separate forms of worship. But the mass of the
nation rejoiced in the downfall of Puritanism,
<note place="foot" n="6">Persecution of Dissenters</note>.
and few of the expelled ministers took with
them the sympathy of their flocks. Their attempt to form
congregations for themselves was prevented by the First
Conventicle Act (May <date value="1664">1664</date>),
which enacted that any meeting
of more than five people for religious worship not in accordance
with the practices of the Church was an illegal
conventicle, and all attending such an assembly for the
third time should be punished by transportation.  Next
year a still crueller law-the Five Mile Act
(<date value="1665-10">October 1665</date>)
-forbade Nonconformist ministers to teach in schools, or
come within five miles of any town or any other place
where they had once held a cure, unless they took an oath



<pb id="p.276" n="276"/>  <note place="foot" n="7"><date value="1665">1665</date>--<date value="1667">1667</date></note>
which few could conscientiously accept.  Thus cut off
from their best chance of earning a living, the persecuted
ministers remained in a pitiable plight. The prisons were
soon filled with Dissenters who, despite harsh laws, still
gathered together to worship God in the way they thought
best. John Bunyan, the village Baptist minister, wrote his
Pilgrim's Progress in Bedford jail. Still harder was the
lot of the Quakers and the other more enthusiastic sectaries.
The Catholics were in practice much better off, for Charles
and many of his courtiers had learnt in their exile to
prefer the old faith to the new, and were quite uninfluenced
by the doctrines of the English Church.</p><p>
Thus the Church system, which Laud had in vain tried
to force on an unwilling people, was now restored, like
the monarchy, by the people themselves. Yet the Long
Parliament had not laboured in vain. Laud had failed
because he had sought to make the Church independent
of Parliament. The Church was now set up in a place as
high as even Laud could have wished by the Parliament
itself. The Commons had even followed Laud's persecuting
methods. Henceforth Dissenters were persecuted
according to law and not against the law. Of course the
legality of persecution did not make it any better. But
even the worst aspects of the Restoration showed how
the Restoration was no mere reaction. If the king had
come back, he had come back at the head of a great
national party. The political struggle was no longer between
king and people, but between two great parties, one of which
had, or thought that it had, the king for its head. The
greatest difficulty in the future was that the men who now
controlled England and the Church were driven by the
violence of the reaction to erect loyalty into a sort of
religion. Charles the Martyr was almost worshipped.
The rule of kings was glorified as the form of government
specially pleasing to God. Divine right, passive obedience,
non-resistance to the Lord's Anointed were generally taught.
Yet some people still kept their heads even in the fierce
loyalty of the Restoration period. The outwitted Presbyterians
of the Convention, though conforming for the
most part to the new Church settlement, still kept up the
ideas of Pym and Hampden in political matters. They
made the nucleus of the country party, that already formed
a sort of opposition to the cavalier government. Before
long the misdeeds of king, court, and ministers, made their
opposition stronger and stronger.</p><p>



   <pb id="p.277" n="277"/>
4. <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. was not fond enough of constant work to
take a large share himself in governing the country. The
Privy Council, now restored, was too big, and
<note place="foot" n="8">The King's Ministers,<dateRange from="1660" to="1667">1660-1667</dateRange>.</note>
contained too many old friends of Oliver or the
Rump. So, as in <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>.'s time, the real
management of affairs fell into the hands of a small Junto
or cabal of Cabinet councillors, half recognised now as the
Committee of Foreign Affairs.  Monck, now made Duke
of Albemarle, might have played a great part, but he cared
nothing for politics, and soon fell into the background.
The four leading ministers were the loyal Irish Cavalier,
Ormonde, who had ruined a princely fortune in the Martyr's
service, and whose honour and integrity were unquestioned;
Colepepper, "a man of great parts, a sharp and present
wit, and an universal understanding," Secretary Nicholas,
"a man of general good reputation with all men, of unquestionable
integrity, and long experience," and, above all,
Edward Hyde (<dateRange from="1609" to="1674">
1609-1674</dateRange>), now Earl of Clarendon, and
Chancellor. Clarendon was a "fair, ruddy, fat, middlestatured
handsome man," who suffered terribly
from gout.  He delighted in state and ostentation.
<note place="foot" n="9">   Clarendon.</note>
 He was a sound lawyer, and a great lover of books
and learned men. He was a good Englishman, a faithful
and able minister, honest in the main, but not over scrupulous,
a strong party man, and so great a friend of the
Church, that the harsh laws against Dissenters were sometimes
called the Clarendon Code. He still adhered to the
views held by him and Falkland in
<date value="1641">1641</date>, and sought to
uphold both king and Parliament. He tried to govern the
country as <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> would have done. He was hated by
the country-party, and laughed at by the wicked and corrupt
courtiers that gathered round the restored king. James,
Duke of York, the king's brother, now married his daughter,
Anne Hyde, " a plain woman like her mother." But James
was not liked, as he was known to be wavering in the Protestant faith.

5. <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> had ever been loyal after her fashion to the
Stewarts, so that when Oliver's Ironsides were gone, the
restoration of the monarchy there was easy work.
<note place="foot" n="10">The Restoration in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>.</note>
The union of the two countries, carried out,
though in too arbitrary a way by the wise foresight of the
Protector, was now ignored in deference to the strong feeling
of the Scots themselves, and despite the advice of
Clarendon. Thus <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> again became, in name at least,
a separate and independent nation, though really <persName key="James I">James I</persName>.'s



<pb id="p.278" n="278"/>    <note place="foot" n="11"><date value="1660">1660</date>--<date value="1661">1661</date></note>
policy of bringing it under English influence was kept up.
She got back her own Parliament and her own Ministry,
but this was at the price of losing that complete freedom
of trade with England which Cromwell's union had allowed.
A Rescissory Act abolished all laws passed since
<date value="1633">1633</date>, so
that bishops were restored in the Church, though none
dared to bring back the hated Liturgy, which had been
the beginning of all the troubles in
<date value="1637">1637</date>, and the synods
and sessions that the Presbyterians loved were kept up as
before, save that the bishops or their nominees acted as
moderators or chairmen in them. As in England, the
Restoration went further than those who started it had
meant. As in England, the Presbyterians (though here the
mass of the nation) were outwitted.  The Marquis of
Argyll was arrested in London, hurried back to <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>,
and beheaded with the "maiden," on frivolous charges of
complicity in <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>.'s death. Johnston of Warriston, and
the fiery minister Guthrie were also executed. The fall of
the clergy brought back power to the Scots nobility, who
now largely accepted Episcopacy. The brutal and drunken
Lord Commissioner Middleton hunted out conventicles, and
the selfish James Sharp, who came to London to urge
the claims of Presbytery, turned traitor, and went back
Archbishop of St. Andrews. John Maitland, Earl of
Lauderdale, who had also abandoned his old Presbyterian
connections, ruled as Secretary for <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. He was a
strong, learned, and able, but coarse and harsh, man, who
boasted "that he would rather hear a cat mew than the
best music in the world," and ill-looking, with long red hair
hanging in disorder over his face. His constant wish to
keep the Scottish Government in Scottish hands, and his
violent opposition to any union with England, gave him
some following among his countrymen, despite his roughness
and persecution of the Presbyterians.  In
<date value="1663">1663</date> he
overthrew Middleton, and ruled henceforward as he
pleased, for Charles trusted him completely. " Never was
king so absolute," he boasted to Charles, "as in poor old
<placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>."</p><p>
6. In <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> it was easy to bring back Charles; but
very hard to settle the terms on which Cromwellian settlers,
<note place="foot" n="12">
The Restoration in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.</note>
loyal Cavaliers, and native Irish Catholics should
live side by side.  Common hatred of the
down-trodden natives, as well as common Protestantism,
bound together both parties among the Englishry.  The
Act of Settlement (<date value="1661">1661</date>) allowed the Puritan adventurers



    <pb id="p.279" n="279"/>
and Cromwell's old soldiers to keep their estates, while all
royalists, Protestant and Catholic alike, were also promised
restoration to the lands they had lost. But it
was soon found that there was not land enough
<note place="foot" n="13">  Act of Settlement,  <date value="1661">1661</date>.</note>
to satisfy all claimants, though the rebel forfeitures were
very large. Ormonde, now a Duke and Lord Lieutenant,
strove to make things as easy as possible, and in
<date value="1665">1665</date> he
carried an Act of Explanation of the Act of Settlement,
under which a third of the Cromwellian grants confirmed in
<date value="1661">1661</date> were given back to the
royalists and the more influential
Catholic claimants. The result was that not one-third of
the soil of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> remained in Catholic, that is, in native
Irish hands. From this flowed the great Agrarian Quesion
of later Irish history.  The keen sense of wrong under
which the Irish were smarting was hardly increased by
the restoration of Episcopacy in the Protestant Church,
for they hated Anglicans and Puritans alike as heretics;
but this was not liked by the Cromwellians and the Scotch
Presbyterians of the north. Among the new Irish bishops
was the pious and eloquent Jeremy Taylor. The Catholic
worship was not absolutely put down, though the priests
and bishops were badly treated. The fiercer Celts forsook
their fields in despair, and formed bands of brigands called
Rapparees and Tories, who preyed on the Englishry. Yet
the country prospered during the next five-and-twenty years
of comparative peace, though the fruits of that prosperity
were mainly reaped by the Protestant minority. England's
policy in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> was always much the same, whether it
came from Strafford or Cromwell or <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.'s ministers.
7. The Restoration brought little change in foreign</p><p>
policy, for Charles liked Frenchmen and French ways, and
Clarendon, like Oliver, clung fast to the old Elizabethan
dislike of Spair as the home of the
<note place="foot" n="14">Foreign policy,<dateRange from="1660" to="1667">1660-1667</dateRange>.</note>
Inquisition, and the rival of England on the seas.
In <date value="1659">1659</date>
France and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> had ended their long war by the Peace of
the Pyrenees, but they were still jealous of each
other.  Louis XIV., a hard-working, clear-headed
<note place="foot" n="15">The French Alliance.</note>
 king of great personal dignity and strong character,
though only of average ability, became in
<date value="1661">1661</date>, by the death
of Cardinal Mazarin, ruler as well as king of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>. He
persuaded the English to keep up Cromwell's old friendship
with him, though far-seeing men understood that<placeName key="France">France</placeName>
had begun to threaten the balance of power in Europe,
and even Clarendon had no love of the French.   The
first sign of the two kings' friendship was the marriage



<pb id="p.280" n="280"/>
<note place="foot" n="16"><date value="1662">1662</date>--<date value="1667">1667</date></note>
(<date value="1662">1662</date>) of Charles
to Catharine of Braganza, sister of the
king of Portugal, a land which, since <date value="1640">
1640</date>, had maintained,
with French help, an heroic struggle for freedom against
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. A large marriage-portion, including the towns of
Bombay, in the East indies, and Tangier, on the African
side of the Straits of Gibraltar, was the price paid by the
Portuguese for the English Alliance.  But a Catholic marriage
was not popular, and folks were still more discontented when,
in <date value="1662">1662</date>,
Charles sold Dunkirk (the Flemish
port Oliver had taken from the Spaniards) to the French.
Clarendon, though not taking a leading share in foreign
policy, and anxious for general peace rather than particular
alliances, was looked upon as responsible for this act, and
was accused, very unjustly, of having been bribed by Louis.
The mob nicknamed the stately palace, which the Chancellor
was building near St. James, " Dunkirk House."
Even when continuing the old policy of Cromwell, Charles
carried it on in so different a spirit that he incurred blame
while Cromwell had been greatly praised.</p><p>
More popular was the fresh attack on the carrying trade
of Holland by the enactment, in <date value="1660">1660</date>, of the Navigation
Act, which gave legal shape to the measures directed
against the Dutch carrying trade that had been already
passed as an ordinance of the Rump. Yet Clarendon, who
had no wish for war, concluded, in <date value="1662">1662</date>, a treaty with the
<note place="foot" n="17">The Dutch War,<dateRange from="1665" to="1666">1665-1666</dateRange>. </note>
Dutch in settlement of all disputes. But trade-jealousy between England and the Seven
Provinces was now complicated by the king's dislike of the
Dutch republicans, who, under the brothers De Witt
now ruled the state, and were keeping his sister's son,
<persName key="William III">William III</persName>., Prince of Orange, out of the Stadtholdership.
Hostilities soon broke out between English and Dutch merchants
on the Gold Coast in Africa, and between the colonists
of New England and New Holland in <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>.
At last the wishes of the merchants carried the day
against the weak will of Clarendon.  From <dateRange from="1665" to="1667">1665 to 1667</dateRange> a
fierce struggle was fought out at sea, in which the Dutch
quite held their own: for corruption and mismanagement
paralysed the English navy, and the vast sums granted by
Parliament for a popular war were shamefully wasted.
" The Dutch do fight in very good order," said the admiralty
official Pepys, "and we in none at all."  In <date value="1665">1665</date> the Duke
of York, who, as Lord High Admiral, proved a careful and
skilful administrator though a mediocre commander, won a
decided victory off Lowestoft, but lost the fruits of it through



    <pb id="p.281" n="281"/>
the skill of his opponents. In <date value="1666-04">April 1666</date> Prince Rupert
and the Duke of Albemarle took the sea with a great fleet
under their joint command. On 1st June the Dutch admiral
Ruyter attacked Albemarle off the North Foreland, while
Rupert with his squadron was away. The Dutch were
superior in numbers, but Monck offered a gallant and long
continued resistance. After two days' fighting he was, however,
forced to retreat. On the third day Rupert rejoined
him, and the battle was renewed. On the fourth day of
the continued fighting, the English were finally forced to
withdraw, but the victorious Dutch were so severely handled
that they were obliged to go home to refit. In July the
two English admirals were again at sea, and this time with
better success. Their victory led to the burning of a
fleet of Dutch merchantmen in harbour, an act which cost
the enemy more than a million pounds. But in
<date value="1667">1667</date> the
English government, not knowing how to raise any more
money, foolishly resolved to lay up the great warships in
harbour. This fatal act gave the Dutch command of the
seas, and in June they made a sudden and successful
attack on the mouth of the Thames. They destroyed
Sheerness, sailed up the Medway to Chatham, where they
burnt eight great men-of-war that were uselessly laid up
there, and cut off London from the sea for several weeks.
Soon after (July <date value="1667">1667</date>)
a peace was made at Breda, by
which each country was to keep the possessions of the
other that it held at the moment. Thus New Amsterdam
(between New England and the Virginian group of
colonies) became English, and being granted to the king's
brother, took the name of New York.  Despite the concessions
made to secure his friendship, Louis, afraid of the
English becoming too strong at sea, supported the Dutch
during the war, and so terrified the hired ally of England,
the Bishop of Munster, in <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>, that he desisted from
the attack which he had threatened to make on the Dutch
by land, with the object of diverting them from devoting all
their strength to the naval struggle. Patriotic Englishmen
already began to sigh for the old days of Blake and Oliver.</p><p>
8. Disasters at home followed disasters abroad. Reaction
from Puritan strictness brought about a wild time of
riot and dissipation in which the king and his
courtiers took the lead. In <date value="1665">1665</date> a terrible
Plague burst out amidst the close and unhealthy
<note place="foot" n="18">  The Great Plague, <date value="1665">1665</date>,
and the Fire of London,<date value="1666">1666</date>.</note>
streets of London. " The people die so," wrote
Pepys in August, " that they are fain to carry the dead to be



<pb id="p.282" n="282"/>  <note place="foot" n="19"><date value="1666">1666</date>-<date value="1667">1667</date></note>
buried by daylight, the nights not sufficing to do it in."
" What a sad time," he lamented, " it is to see no boats on
the river; and grass grow all up and down Whitehall court,
and nobody but poor wretches in the streets." For many rich
ran away from the danger, leaving the poor to suffer.
After the plague died away a Great Fire broke out near
London Bridge, and burnt down nearly half of the City
(September <date value="1666">1666</date>).
"I saw the whole south of the City
burning," wrote Evelyn, "from Cheapside to the Thames.
The people hardly stirred to quench it, so that there was
nothing heard or seen but crying out and lamentation.
All the sky was of a fiery aspect, like the top of a burning
oven, and the light seen above 40 miles round. I now saw
10,000 houses all in one flame; the noise and cracking and
thunder of the flames, the shrieking of women, the hurry of
people, the fall of towers and churches were like a hideous
storm: the stones of St. Paul's flew like grenados, the
melting lead running down the streets in a stream. The
eastern wind drove the flames forward till it pleased God
to abate it." At last the people took courage, and by blowing
up houses stopped the flames. In some ways the Fire
was a blessing in disguise, for it swept away the foul haunts
of the plague, and enabled the City to be rebuilt in a
healthier way.</p><p>
9. Bitter complaints arose of bad management, and of
the moneys meant for the Dutch war being spent on the
king's unworthy favourites, while men were
<note place="foot" n="20">Impeachmentof Clarendon,<date value="1667">1667</date></note>
shocked at "the horrible crowd and lamentable
moan of the poor seamen that lie starving
in the streets for lack of money." Clarendon was made
the scapegoat, Charles and his courtiers giving him up
very willingly. In August <date value="1667">1667</date>
the Chancellor was dismissed from office, and in
October he was impeached of
high treason.  But of the seventeen articles which the
Commons drew up against him only one, which asserted
that he had betrayed the king's secrets to his enemies,
amounted to treason: and that article could not be proved.
The Lords therefore declined to commit him to prison,
whereupon Charles, who wanted Clarendon out of the
way, recommended him to leave the kingdom. The fallen
minister took the king's advice, and, instead of waiting his
trial, fled to<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, where he passed the rest of his life,
beguiling his leisure by writing in stately prose his famous
History of the Rebellion. The Lords, taking his flight as
a proof of guilt, passed an act for his banishment.  Few

lamented his fall. Soon after his friend Ormonde lost the
Lord-Lieutenancy of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.</p><p>
10. George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, son of Charles
I.'s favourite, and the son-in-law of Lord Fairfax, had most
to do with getting rid of Clarendon. The poet Dryden
described this young statesman, not untruly, as
<quote rend="blockquote">"A man so various that he seemed to be
Not one but all mankind's epitome:
Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong,
Was everything by starts and nothing long;
But in the course of one revolving moon
Was chymist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon."</quote>
Buckingham was a debauchee and a spendthrift, with neither
earnestness nor principle. Careless about religion, he now
sought to bring the king and the Dissenters together
against the old Cavalier party.   His best helper was
Anthony Ashley Cooper, now Lord Ashley, Chancellor of
the Exchequer since <date value="1661">1661</date>.
Ashley was a strong upholder
of Parliamentary government and toleration, a friend of
the philosopher, John Locke, and the best party manager
and cleverest debater of the age; but he was factious,
ambitious, greedy, and unscrupulous.   Dryden's famous
lines bring out what his enemies thought about him:-
<quote rend="blockquote">" Restless, unfixed in principles and place,
In power unpleased, impatient of disgrace;
A fiery soul, which, working out its way,
Fretted the pigmy body to decay,
And o'er-informed the tenement of clay.
A daring pilot in extremity,
Pleased with the danger when the waves went high,
He sought the storms, but for a calm unfit
Would steer too nigh the sands to boast his wit."</quote>
Henry Bennet, Lord Arlington, a selfish, pompous, able
though slow-minded man, "who could never shake off a
little air of formality that an embassy to <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> had infected
him with," but who had, however, a great knowledge of
foreign affairs, had been Secretary of State since
<date value="1662">1662</date>.
He brought into power Sir Thomas Clifford, after
<date value="1672">1672</date>
Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, a hot Catholic, disliked for
"folly, ambition, desire of popularity, rudeness of tongue,
and passions," but loved by his friends for his generosity
and sincerity.  These four men gradually joined with
Lauderdale, the dictator of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, in a new
Cabinet, which became infamous as the Cabal,
<note place="foot" n="21">The Cabal, <dateRange from="1667" to="1673"> 1667-1673</dateRange>.
</note>a word spelt, curiously enough, by the initials of their

names. They were all unscrupulous and self-seeking men,
with many differences of policy, but they were now bound
together on a common plan of toleration, in opposition to
Clarendon's strong Church policy. Though Charles often
took their advice, they formed no regular ministry, and
did not even constitute a secret council, meeting together
to agree on common action. But Parliament would have
nothing to say to their fine schemes, and even the
Dissenters were afraid of a toleration offered in the interest
of the Catholics. In <date value="1670">1670</date> Parliament passed the Second
Conventicle Act, imposing fresh penalties on Nonconformists.
The Cabal therefore dropped constitutional courses,
and sought to exalt the royal power. Their rule was marked
by wiser policy but stained by shameless misgovernment
and gross corruption.</p><p>
11. The Cabal strove to reverse Clarendon's policy abroad
as well as at home. Louis XIV. was now waging a new
<note place="foot" n="23">The Triple Alliance, <date value="1668">1668</date>.</note>
war with <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> in the Netherlands, parts of
which he claimed to belong to his wife, Maria
Theresa of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, after the death of her father,
Philip IV. of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, in <date value="1665">1665</date>. Louis maintained that, by a
local custom, the daughters of an earlier marriage had a
right to succeed to certain. lands in Brabant before the sons
of a second marriage, such as <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>., Maria Theresa's
half-brother, the sickly child who now ruled over <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>
(<dateRange from="1665" to="1700">1665-1700</dateRange>).
This right was called the Right of Devolution,
and the war that now broke out was called the War of
Devolution. Louis's successes soon filled Europe with alarm.
At last, in June <date value="1668">1668</date>, Sir William Temple, a famous diplomatist
and man of letters, arranged at the Hague a Triple
Alliance between England, the United Provinces and
Sweden to restore peace to Europe.  For a time this
alliance seemed brilliantly successful.  Louis was forced
to make the Peace of Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle, <date value="1668">1668</date>) and
give up the Free County of Burgundy, which he had
conquered, though he was permitted to keep a large
number of Netherlandish towns, including Douai, Tournai
and Lille.  He never forgave the Dutch for their
resistance to his plans, and he soon found means to win
England from their side.  Bennet and Clifford, and the
king, as friends of the Catholics, had been no advocates of an
alliance with the Protestant powers. Temple's scheme for
extending the alliance into a lasting league was put aside.
At last, in <date value="1670">1670</date>, Louis sent his sister-in-law, the beautiful
Henrietta, Duchess of Orleans, to conclude with her brother



     <pb id="p.285" n="285"/>
King Charles the secret Treaty of Dover, by which Charles
agreed to help Louis against Holland and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, and
Louis promised Charles men and money to
put down opposition, and to bring back
Catholicism in England.  Charles was afraid
<note place="foot" n="24">The Treaty of Dover, <date value="1670">1670</date>.
</note>to tell even Ashley, Buckingham, and Lauderdale of this
wicked plot, although he got them to join his plan of war
with Holland by showing them a sham treaty with<placeName key="France">France</placeName>
in which the worst clauses of the real treaty were left out.</p><p>
12. In <date value="1672">1672</date> England and
France began the attack on
the Seven Provinces.  To get money, Clifford advised
Charles to stop all payments for a year from
the Exchequer (<date value="1672">1672</date>). The result of this was
that the goldsmiths and bankers, who had
<note place="foot" n="25">War against Holland, <dateRange from="1672" to="1674">1672-74</dateRange>.</note>
advanced more than a million to the Government, could not
get their principal back. It was thought a great favour
to promise them half the usual interest. The bankers in
their turn could only offer diminished interest to their
customers, and the whole of English trade was disorganised.
This was called the Stop of the Exchequer. Through it
Charles, says Evelyn, " ruined many widows and orphans,
whose stocks were lent him, and the reputation of his
Exchequer for ever. Never did his affairs prosper after it,
for it did not supply the expense of the war, but melted
away, I know not how."</p><p>
Louis XIV. invaded Holland by land, and the Duke of
York fought, in June <date value="1672">1672</date>,
a long and doubtful sea-fight
with Ruyter off Southwold Bay, in <placeName key="Suffolk">Suffolk</placeName>. Four of the
Seven Provinces were soon overrun, and Amsterdam itself
was only saved by cutting the dykes and putting the
country under water. The Dutch believed that the merchant
princes, who, since <date value="1650">1650</date>,
had ruled the republic, and had
long upheld an alliance with<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, were to blame for the
great peril that was upon them. Riots broke out; the reigning
oligarchy was violently overthrown; the two De Witts,
the leaders of the republican party, were cruelly murdered,
and the stadtholdership restored and given to <persName key="William III">William III</persName>.,
Prince of Orange. The new stadtholder was the son of
Wiliam II. by Mary, daughter of <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>., and therefore
<persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.'s nephew, and, after York's two daughters, the
next in succession to the English crown. William was a
sickly, thoughtful, young man, unattractive in his private
life, and cold and self-seeking, but of daring and heroic
temper, who encouraged his countrymen to resist the
invaders to the last, and set to work at once to build up

a fresh European alliance against<placeName key="France">France</placeName>. Brandenburg,
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> and the Empire, alarmed at Louis's rapid progress,
joined him, and the worst danger was soon over. Instead
of having Holland at her mercy,<placeName key="France">France</placeName> had now to face
a comparatively equal war against a great coalition. Thus
was revived the policy of combined opposition to<placeName key="France">France</placeName>,
which had been momentarily set on foot by Temple's Triple
Alliance. For the rest of his life William devoted himself to
strenuously opposing French ascendency, and was the soul
of every movement directed against Louis XIV. He had,
however, to contend against enormous difficulties, and it
was long before he attained much success.</p><p>
13. Ashley was now Earl of Shaftesbury and Lord Chancellor,
being the last layman who ever held that office, and
 of exciting the laughter of the lawyers as he sat
<note place="foot" n="27">DeclarationIndulgence,<date value="1672">1672</date>.
</note>on the bench "in an ash-coloured gown, silver-laced,
and full-ribboned pantaloons displayed,
without any black at all, and looking more like a university
nobleman than a high chancellor." In March <date value="1672">1672</date>, he was
able to persuade Charles to issue a Declaration of Indulgence
for all Dissenters, though the proclamation was only legal if
the king had, as he claimed, the power both to sus5entd
altogether and to dispense in particular cases with Acts of
Parliament. But suspicions of the Dover plot were abroad,
and it was thought that this was the first step to bring back
Popery and arbitrary power.  When Parliament met in
 <date value="1673-01">January1673</date>,
 Cavaliers themselves objected to the prerogative
 being used to take away the ascendency of their
Church.  In vain Shaftesbury thundered against the
Dutch, crying " Delenda est Carthago," and declaring that
they would ruin our trade. In vain Charles gave up his
Declaration. The imminent danger to religion led even
merchants and traders to think little of the need of crushing
our commercial rivals, and much of the need of upholding
Protestantism. Parliament insisted on passing the Test
Act, which required all who held office in the state to
receive the Holy Communion in the Church of England's
the Test Act and fall ofthe Cabal, <date value="1673">1673</date>.
way, and to renounce the doctrine of Transubstantiation.
Seeing that his connection with
the Catholics had damaged himself and his
favourite cause, Shaftesbury hotly supported the bill. It
broke up the Cabal, for Clifford (Lord Treasurer since
<date value="1672">1672</date>)
would not take the test, and Arlington turned round to the
Dutch interest, though he did not escape being impeached
in <date value="1674">1674</date> as the great
" conduit-pipe" of the king's misdeeds.




<pb id="p.287" n="287"/>
This forced him to give up his secretaryship and politics
altogether. The Duke of York, now an avowed Catholic,
and the husband of a Catholic Italian princess, Mary
Beatrice of Modena, resigned the office of Lord High
Admiral. The Dutch still held their own at sea, Ruyter
defeating Rupert in <date value="1673">1673</date>
off the sandhills of Zeeland. In
<date value="1674">1674</date> the Commons,
who hated the war, forced Charles to
make with the Seven Provinces the Peace of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>.
Louis kept at war with the Dutch despite the loss of the
English alliance and the European coalition that had been
formed to support them.
14. The failure of the Cabal to secure religious toleration,
and keep up the French alliance, brought into power
Sir Thomas Osborne, a <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName> gentleman
<note place="foot" n="28">The Rule of Danby,<dateRange from="1673" to="1678">1673-78</dateRange>
</note>of comely person and great political craft, who,
since Clarendon's fall, had step by step become
the leader of the Church party in Parliament.  In June
<date value="1673">1673</date> he became Lord High Treasurer,
and in <date value="1674">1674</date> Earl of
Danby, and he remained for nearly six years at the head
of affairs.  His revival of Clarendon's church-and-king
policy made it easier for him to deal with the Commons,
and he did not scruple to bribe and corrupt them. But his
foreign policy was just the reverse of that pursued during
Clarendon's Chancellorship. He went back to the principles
of the Triple Alliance, which he sought to revive.<placeName key="France">France</placeName> was
still winning victories, despite the heroic efforts of William
III. and the conspicuous triumph of Frederick William
(the Great Elector of Brandenburg, and the founder of Prus
sian greatness) over the Swedes, now as of old in French
pay. But Charles took Louis's bribes, and in his shiftless
unsteady way still leant on his support. In
<date value="1676">1676</date> Charles
made a new secret treaty with Louis, which he copied out
and signed with his own hand. In return for &#x00A3;Ioo,ooo a
year, he agreed to enter into no engagements with any
foreign power without the French king's consent. Yet the
restoration of the house of Orange made it easier for him
to keep friendly with the Dutch, and in <date value="1677">
1677</date>, urged by
Danby, he assembled a large army intended to be used
against<placeName key="France">France</placeName>; but though the Commons cried for war,
they were afraid to entrust the king with money to carry it
on. In November <date value="1677">1677</date>, Danby
procured the marriage of
the Protestant princess, Mary of York, the elder daughter
of James by his first wife, Anne Hyde, to the Prince of
Orange. These acts of hostility showed Louis that, despite
his secret treaties with Charles himself, he could not depend



<pb id="p.288" n="288"/>         <note place="foot" n="29">[<date value="1678">1678</date>--<date value="1679">1679</date></note>
upon controlling the foreign policy of England. Fearing
that England might join the coalition against him,
Louis made up his mind to end the war. In <date value="1678">1678</date> he
succeeded in signing the Treaty of Nijmegen (Nimeguen)
with Holland and her allies, securing this time the
Free County, and twelve more Netherlandish cities,
among which were Valenciennes, Cambrai and Ypres.
He was tired of wasting his money on Charles, and now
set himself to bribe the chiefs of the opposition, who
were as ready as the king to take his gold. He perceived
that his best plan was to play off king and Parliament
against each other, so that England would remain too weak
and divided to take a strong line abroad. The results of
this subtle policy were soon seen in a rank growth of
faction.</p><p>
15. In <date value="1678">1678</date> terrible
consternation was excited by the
rumour of a great Popish Plot. " The Parliament and the
whole nation were now alarmed about a conspiracy of some
<note place="foot" n="30">The PopishPlot,	<dateRange from="1678" to="1680">1678-80</dateRange>.</note>
eminent Papists for the destruction of the king
and the introduction of Popery, discovered by
one Titus Oafes, lately an apostate to the Church of Rome,
and now back in the English Church with this discovery.
Everybody believed what he said, and it quite changed the
genius and motions of the Parliament, now corrupt and
interested with long sitting and Court practices; but with
all this Popery would not go down. This discovery turned
them all as one man against it, and nothing was done but
to find out the depth of this. The murder of Sir Endmundbury
Godfrey, found strangled about this time, as was
manifest, by the Papists, he being a justice of the peace,
who knew much of their practices, put the whole nation
into a new ferment against them."  Oates's first victims
were tried and executed.  On this Oates grew so presumptuous
as to accuse the queen of attempting to poison
the king.  But Charles refused to listen to this absurd
charge, and even Oates did not venture to press it for long.
Several Roman Catholic peers were, however, sent to the
Tower, accused by Oates. Bedloe, Dangerfield, and other
knavish informers followed Oates in his profitable trade of denouncing
Papists. The judges, led by Chief-Justice Scroggs,
did their best to frighten juries into giving verdicts. A
blind panic seized on the whole nation. Though Sir George
Wakeman, the queen's physician, was acquitted, the aged
and virtuous Lord Stafford (one of the Howards), and many
lesser but equally innocent sufferers, fell, in
<date value="1680">1680</date>, a victim to



      <pb id="p.289" n="289"/>
the popular fears. Constant Catholic intrigues half explain
the nation's uneasiness, but nothing can excuse the blind
way in which every one listened to the tales of the informers.
There may have been a " Popish plot," but Oates's stories
were all false. As Dryden said:</p><p>
<quote rend="blockquote">"Some truth there was, but
dashed and brewed with lies,
To please the fools and puzzle all the wise."</quote>
The opposition, led by Shaftesbury, made a clever but
wicked use of the passion of the people and the increasing
disgust felt for the Court, and Parliament now passed
an Act disabling all Roman Catholics, except the Duke of
York, from sitting in it. In December <date value="1678">
1678</date> Danby was
impeached and driven from office, Louis XIV. (who hated
him for his friendship for William of Orange) supplying
the chief evidence against him by revealing a treaty to
which he was an unwilling partner, and by which Charles
was to have got a huge bribe from the French king. To
save Danby, Charles, in January <date value="1679">
1679</date>, dissolved the Parliament, which had
been sitting since <date value="1661">1661</date>. Many years of
misgovernment, and the accession of many new opposition
members at by-elections, had cured this Long Parliament
of the Restoration of its blind love for royalty, though to
the last it was bigoted against all non-churchmen.</p><p>
16. In March <date value="1679">1679</date>
the new Parliament, in which the
"country party" was overwhelmingly strong, met and at
once took up Danby's impeachment. Shaftesbury now had
everything his own way with the indignant
<note place="foot" n="31">The Exclusion Bill and the Habeas Corpus <date value="1679">1679</date>.
</note>Commons. The panic about the "Plot" terrified
folks at the chance of a Papist, like the Duke
of York, becoming king. In the fierce temper Act,
that had lately grown up, the Commons cared little for the
notions of Divine Right and hereditary succession, which
had been so popular in the early days of the Restoration.
They now believed that at all costs England must be ruled
by a Protestant king. An Exclusion Bill was therefore
brought in to keep the Duke of York out of the succession,
and read a second time. At the same time the Habeas
Corpus Act was passed "for the better securing the liberty
of the subject, and for preventing imprisonment beyond
the seas."</p><p>
By it the various obstacles in the way of getting a Writ of Habeas
Corpus [see page 206] were removed. All judges were empowered
and obliged to issue the writ, and severe penalties were imposed on
gaolers who refused to obey it. The custom, very common since the




<pb id="p.290" n="290"/>                  <note place="foot" n="32"><date value="1679"> 1679</date>-<date value="1680">1680</date></note>
Restoration, of sending political prisoners to places like the Channel
Islands or <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, outside the jurisdiction of the English courts, to
avoid the writs, was now abolished.</p><p>
So strong were Shaftesbury and his friends that Charles
tried to make terms with them.  He called on Sir William
Temple to invent a New Council of ministers, less
unwieldy and less dependent than the Privy Council, and
wider and more popular than the hated cabals of cabin
counsellors. Temple's Council consisted of thirty very rich
men, including many opposition leaders, with Shaftesbury
himself as President.  But it proved a failure, having
neither the old traditions of the Privy Council nor the
usefulness of the Cabinet.  In July Charles dissolved
Parliament to save his brother's prospects of becoming
king.</p><p>
17. Fresh elections were held in the autumn, but Charles
was afraid, if he allowed the new Parliament to meet, that it
would prove as unruly as the last one. He
<note place="foot" n="33">Whigs andTories, <date value="1679">1679</date> </note>
hoped "to wait till this violence should wear
off, and meanwhile hold his realms, and do all he could to
satisfy his people." The party which desired to pass the
Exclusion Bill was much disgusted at this inactivity, and
sent many petitions to the king, begging him to let Parliament
meet to transact business. But Shaftesbury and his
followers had now gone too far, and a large number of friends
of order, disgusted at their reckless violence, joined the
courtiers in sending to Charles counter-petitions, declaring
that they abhorred those that sought to interfere with the
king's prerogative of summoning Parliament at his own
pleasure. The two parties thus got the names of Petitioners
and Abhorrers, before long changed into Whig and Tory.
These words, at first insulting nicknames, were soon used
by every one to describe the two great parties into which
the country had been divided ever since the Restoration.
The word Whig or Whigamore was taken from the name
of the bitter Covehanters of south-western <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. The
word Tory came from the Catholic Irish outlaws who lurked
in the bogs and mountains, and plundered and killed their
Protestant tyrants.</p><p>
18. A popular revolt now broke out in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, where
the restoration of bishops was still bitterly resented, despite
the concessions that had been made to meet Presbyterian
feeling. The curates, as the Episcopalian clergy were
called, were almost universally despised. " Men think it,"
wrote a friend of bishops, " a stain to their blood to place



 <pb id="p.291" n="291"/>
their sons in that function; and women are ashamed to
marry with any of them. They are accounted by many as
the dross and refuse of the nation." But they were upheld
by the corrupt and careless nobles who now ruled
<placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, relying on English support. Dissent, as in England,
had been made penal, and the hillside meetings were
ruthlessly broken up. The stern Covenanters or Cameronians
(so the extreme Presbyterians were called
<note place="foot" n="34">The cameronian revolt in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>,<date value="1679">1679</date>.</note>
from their preacher, Richard Cameron) had
been brutally persecuted during the long rule of
Lauderdale. In <date value="1667">1667</date>
a little band of about a
thousand took up arms, believing "that God was able to
save by few as well as by many" ; but they were overwhelmed
in a fight among the Pen/land Hills (south of
Edinburgh). In <date value="1677">1677</date>
a gang of wild Highlandmen, called
the Highland Host, was quartered on the most disaffected
regions to overawe them into loyalty.  However, Archbishop
Sharp, " the Judas who had sold the kirk of Christ
for 50,000 marks," was caught and murdered on Magus
Muir, near Cupar Fife, May <date value="1679">1679</date>,
by a gang of Covenanters headed by Hackston of Rathillet and Balfour of
Kinloch, who took refuge in the south-west, where the
cause was strongest.  Here the fierce enthusiasts stirred
up the whole countryside, and many drilled and armed
Covenanters flocked together to hold a great conventicle to
protest against the proscription of the Covenant. The
royalist commander,John Graham of Claverhouse, attempted
to disperse the conventicle at Drumclog, but his dragoons
fled in disorder before the scythes and pitchforks of the
peasantry. After this unexpected success, the revolt spread
like wild-fire. By Shaftesbury's advice, James Duke of
Monmouth, the eldest of <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.'s numerous natural
children, was sent down to suppress the rising. On 22nd
June <date value="1679">1679</date>, Monmouth
ended the revolt by his victory at
Bothzwell Bridge, on the Clyde, a few miles above Glasgow.
But he was hand and glove with the English Whigs and
was unwilling to be too harsh on their Scottish namesakes.
However, ere long he came home, and the Duke of York
went to <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, and set to work to stamp out the Covenanters
by imprisonment, torture, executions, and harsh
martial law. In <date value="1680">1680</date>
Cameron himself came back from
Holland, and slunk about the country preaching, attended
by a band of armed followers, till he was surprised and
slain at Airdsmoss in Ayrshire. Next year, Archibald, Earl
of Argyll, son of the beheaded Marquis, and as zealous as



<pb id="p.292" n="292"/>    <note place="foot" n="35"><date value="1680">1680</date>--<date value="1681">1681</date></note>
his father on the Presbyterian side, was condemned, on
technical grounds, of "leasing making," or treason; he,
however, escaped from prison through the devotion of his
step-daughter, and, after lurking long in London, took refuge
in Holland, which had become the rallying-place of all
Whig exiles.</p><p>
19. Monmouth was "the darling of his father and the
ladies; extremely handsome and adroit; an excellent
<note place="foot" n="36">Monmouth.</note>  soldier and dancer, a favourite of the people,"
and from his weak shallow  nature easily led
astray by stronger heads than his own. Shaftesbury now
brought him forward in opposition to the Duke of York.
The simple Absalom soon followed the crafty Achitophel
in intriguing against his father. "The bells and bonfires
of the city welcomed him back to London; the people
made their idol of the Protestant Duke."  It was even
said that Charles had married his mother, a Welshwoman
of low character, named Lucy Walters. The cry was raised
that he ought to be the next king. This was a fatal mistake
for Shaftesbury and his friends.  Not only was the
Court disgusted, but Shaftesbury lost all his influence with
Charles.  He was turned out of the presidency of the
new Council, and all his friends soon after resigned.
Temple's Council had already broken down.   A little
cabinet had formed within it, of which the chief was the
brilliant and fair-minded George Savile, Earl and afterwards
Marquis of Halifax, "a man of a great and ready
wit, full of life and very pleasant, and much given to
satire." Halifax boasted that he was neither Whig nor
Tory, but a Trimmer between the two factions.  In him
Charles now put his chief trust. The other leading ministers
were Laurence Hyde, the second son of Clarendon, Robert
Spencer, Earl of Sunderland, and Sidney Godol5hin, all
young men, who were spoken of as the " young statesmen "
or the " chits." As Dryden wrote:-</p><p>
<quote rend="blockquote">"But Sunderland, Godolphin, Lory,
These will appear such chits in story,
'Twill turn all politics to jests,
To be repeated like John Dory,
When fiddlers sing at feasts."</quote></p><p>
In <date value="1680-10">October 1680</date> Charles's Fourth Parliament, that had
been elected a year earlier, was at last suffered to meet.
Its session was short and stormy.  The Exclusion Bill
was again brought forward and easily passed through
the Commons, but in the Lords the convincing eloquence



    <pb id="p.293" n="293"/>
of Halifax "was much too hard for Shaftesbury, who had
never been so outdone before." Chiefly through Halifax's
efforts the Lords rejected the Bill by 63 to 30.
The furious Commons stopped supplies, refused to
pass laws, and declared the Great Fire
<note place="foot" n="37">The Pariaments of<dateRange from="1680" to="1681">1680-1681</dateRange>.</note>
of London to be the work of Papist incendiaries.  In
<date value="1681-01">January 1681</date> Charles ventured to dissolve Parliament. In
March a new Parliament, the fifth and last of the reign, met
at Oxford. The king thought that in Tory Oxford, far from
the support of the City mob, Parliament might be more
tractable. But the Whig members came there with bands
of armed followers, and all believed that a new civil war
must soon break out. In vain Charles offered his consent
to his brother's banishment and to the Prince of Orange
being regent with full powers, so long as James kept the
name of king. The Commons would hear of nothing but
absolute exclusion. Fortunately for James, a fierce quarrel
broke out between Lords and Commons, which gave the king
a pretext for dissolving the Parliament after it had only sat a
week. But the violence, factiousness, and unscrupulousness
of the Whigs had overshot their mark. " The Popish Plot,"
wrote Evelyn, " which had hitherto made such a noise, now
began sensibly to dwindle, through the folly, knavery,
impudence, and giddiness of Oates, so that the Papists
began to hold up their heads higher than ever, and those
who had fled, flocked to London from  abroad.  Such
sudden changes and eager doings there had been without
anything steady or prudent for these last seven years !"
20. The Tories had at last the upper hand. Laurence
Hyde, now made Earl of Rochester, was the chief agent of
the reaction, and, until the end of the reign, remained
foremost in the king's favour. Halifax
now began slightly to lose influence with his
<note place="foot" n="38">The Tory Reaction,<dateRange from="1681" to="1685">
1681-1685</dateRange>, andthe Rye House Plot <date value="1683">1683</date>
</note>counsels of moderation, though he remained in
office until the end of the reign. The Court party
now sought for vengeance, and the same corrupt judges
and frightened juries that in previous years had brought
about the scandalous condemnations of the Catholics, were
now set to work to bring about equally scandalous condemnations
of the fallen Whigs. Their first victim was
Stephen College, the "Protestant joiner " who had invented
the "Protestant flail," a sort of life-preserver to ward off
Papist assassins, and who had ridden armed to Oxford.
<quote rend="blockquote">"Brave College is hang'd, the chief of our hopes,
For pulling down bishops and making new popes."</quote></p><p>



<pb id="p.294" n="294"/> <note place="foot" n="39"><date value="1681">1681</date>--<date value="1685">1685</date></note>
In <date value="1681-07">July 1681</date> Shaftesbury
himself was sent to the Tower
on a charge of treason. But in November the grand jury
threw out the bill against him. The Londoners, among
whom Whig feeling lingered longest, rang their bells and
kindled bonfires.  Shaftesbury lived for the next year
entirely within the City, trusting to its privileges and its Whig
magistrates. But the Court procured the election of a Tory
lord mayor, whereupon Shaftesbury, after failing to arrange
with Monmouth for a rising in the west, fled to Holland,
where he died early in <date value="1683">1683</date>.  His friend John Locke
followed him into exile. Monmouth, unforgiven by his
father, was banished also. In despair the fiercer Whigs
turned to treason.  They were guided by the Scot, Robert
Ferguson, "the Plotter," a "tall lean man, with thin jaws,
heat in his face, sharp piercing eye and a shuffling gait,"
who was at the bottom of most conspiracies for nearly a
generation. "After the Popish Plot," says Evelyn, " there
was now a new Protestant plot discovered that certain lords
and others should design the assassination of the king and
the duke as they were to come from Newmarket, with a
general rising of the nation and especially of the City of
London disaffected to the present government." This plot
was called the Rye House Plot (<date value="1683">1683</date>), from a house of that
name near Hoddesdon, in Hertfordshire, where a sturdy
Whig, Richard Rumbold, once an officer in Oliver's own regiment,
now traded as a maltster. There the conspirators
planned to murder Charles and James, as they passed by on
their road to London, after attending horse races at Newmarket.
But the plot was discovered, and the Whig leaders
were arrested. The Rye House Plot was mixed up with
the more general conspiracy before Shaftesbury's escape.
Among the victims were William, Lord Russell, eldest son
of the Earl of Bedford, and a man of upright and blameless
character, and Algernon Sidney, son of the Earl
of Leicester, who maintained the old doctrines of the
"Commonwealth's men" of the Rump, and wished to
make England an aristocratic republic. Lord <placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName>, son
of the royalist Lord Capel, executed in <date value="1649">1649</date>, and a " sober,
wise, judicious and pondering person," cut his throat in the
Tower to avoid an attainder, and the forfeiture of the
family estates. "Every one," says Tory Evelyn, "deplored
<placeName key="Essex">Essex</placeName> and Russell, as being drawn in on pretence of
endeavouring to rescue the king from his present counsellors;
while the rest who were fled, especially Ferguson
and his gang, had doubtless some bloody design to set


    <pb id="p.295" n="295"/>
up a commonwealth." The evidence against both Russell
and Sidney was weak, though decided to be legally sufficient,
and their trials were mere mockeries of justice.</p><p>
The Duke of York now again took his seat in Council and at
the Admiralty, despite the Test Act. Writs of quo warranto
were issued inquiring by what authority the corporations of
boroughs, most of which were nests of Whiggism, exercised
their privileges. The object was to frighten them to give
up their old charters and issue new ones which secured for
the Tories the chief place in the Borough Councils. As the
borough members were mostly returned by the Town
Councils, it was hoped that this would secure a majority
for the Tories in future Parliaments. But the king would
not call a new Parliament yet, though the three years of the
Triennial Act were overpast, and the Trimmer Halifax urged
strongly that a popular king like Charles need not be afraid
to meet his faithful Commons.</p><p>
21. Never was the Court braver than in the early months
of <date value="1685">1685</date>, and never were
grave men more shocked by the
" inexpressible luxury and profaneness, gaming,
and all dissoluteness, and, as it were, total forgetfulness
of God, which was then to be seen
in the glorious gallery of Whitehall." But on
<note place="foot" n="40">Death and Character of <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>,<date value="1685">1685</date></note>
2nd February Charles, a hale and hearty man for his years,
was suddenly smitten with an apopletic fit. He rallied for
a while, but it was only a short reprieve. Fresh fits followed,
with fever and great weakness.  He refused to
receive the Holy Communion from Archbishop Sancroft,
and was privately reconciled to the Church of Rome as he
lay a-dying by Father Huddleston, "the priest that had a
great hand in saving him after Worcester fight, for which
he was excepted out of all the severe acts against priests."
He died on 6th February.</p><p>
Charles was "a tall man, about two yards high, his hair
a deep brown, near to black," and of a harsh, dark complexion,
" his countenance fierce, his voice great, proper of
person, every motion became him." He lived an active
life, delighting in walking and exercise, and always taking
great care of his health.  "He was debonair, easy of
access, not bloody or cruel; a lover of the sea, and skilful
in shipping, not affecting other studies. Yet he had a
laboratory, and knew many empirical medicines, and the
easier mathematics; he loved planting and building, and
brought in a politer way of living, which passed to luxury
and intolerable expense. He had a particular talent for



<pb id="p.296" n="296"/> <note place="foot" n="41"><date value="1685">1685</date>-<date value="1685">1685</date></note>
telling a story, and facetious passages of which he had
innumerable: this made some buffoons and vicious wretches
too presumptuous and familiar.  He took a delight in
having a number of little spaniels follow him, and lie in
his bed-chamber." He had a strong memory, great power
of observation, an even temper, and an extraordinary quickness
of apprehension. His kindly manners made him much
beloved, but he was idle, improvident, selfish, and extravagant.
His wife, Catharine of Portugal, had little or no
influence over him, and played but a small part in the gay
life of his Court. He was governed by a long succession
of worthless female favourites, such as the handsome and
greedy Barbara Villiers, whom he made Duchess of Cleveland,
Eleanor Gwyn, a witty comic actress, and Louise de
Keroualle, a Breton lady, " a famous beauty, but of a childish,
simple, and baby face," who came over to England in the
days of the treaty of Dover, became Duchess of Portsmouth,
and long kept him to his unworthy dependence on Louis XIV.
As a man he set an evil example, which too many of his
subjects faithfully followed. As a politician he played an
almost equally degrading part. He sold himself and his
country to the French king, and would willingly have
brought in Popery and arbitrary power, though he was too
lazy and careless to make the continued effort necessary to
carry out a consistent policy.  But he never wavered in
supporting what he thought his brother's lawful claims,
and, alone of the Stewart kings, he had shrewdness and
common sense enough to see things as they really were.
He made up his mind never to "go on his travels again,"
and discreetly stood aside whenever public opinion raged
too high against his policy. Thus he in some ways played
the part of a constitutional king.  It was this shrewd
recognition of public opinion that enabled Charles to
maintain his throne despite all the troubles-many of his
own making-that beset him, and thus to save England
from the danger of more revolutions when she most wanted
quiet and rest. Laughing at religion when well, and turning
to Catholicism when sick and serious, he was no Tory nor
Church of England man. But he used the devotion of those
at whose prejudices he scoffed, and whose good qualities
he was not earnest enough to understand. It speaks well
for his good humour, his politeness and his wits that he
died popular.</p>

<p>1. Despite the Test Act and the Exclusion Bill, James,
Duke of York, now became the Catholic king of Protestant
England. He was fifty-two years old," some
thing above the middle stature, well-shaped,
very nervous and strong. His face was rather
<note place="foot" n="1">Accession and Character of <persName key="James II">James II</persName>, <date value="1685">1685</date>
</note>long, his complexion fair, his countenance engaging; but his
outward carriage was a little stiff and constrained. Having
something of a hesitation in his speech, his discourse was
not so gracious as it was judicious and solid. He was a
great lover of exercise, especially walking and hunting, but
no diversion made him neglect his business." He had
neither the ability nor the insight of his brother. His
character rather resembled that of his father, though he
lacked his father's external graces. He was slow, patient,
and plodding, sticking to his opinions with great obstinacy,
and with little noble or generous about him. Yet Whig
enemies allowed him to be "naturally a man of truth,
fidelity, and justice."  But he was ruled by priests and
women, and had set his heart on bringing back the
Roman Church, and with that object he sought to make
the king's power more absolute. He was hard-working,
unforgiving, remorseless, treacherous even, in carrying out
these great ends.</p><p>
2. James's very accession was a Tory triumph. Hot
Churchmen as they mostly were, the Tories had kept out of
sight James's want of Churchmanship because
<note place="foot" n="2">The Tory rule continued.</note>
he was the lineal heir to the throne. The
Tory ministers still held office, and Tory writers and
preachers still taught that kings ruled by divine right, and
that subjects were bound to passive obedience to all their
commands. James's first acts did not much alarm the Tory
zeal for the Church. He submitted to be crowned by the
Archbishop of Canterbury, William Sancroft, and promised
to uphold the Church, for Churchmen, he said, were always
loyal subjects. But he at once went to Mass in state, and
though professing to regard his religion as a private matter,
he did not long remain in that mind. However, for the
first few months of his reign, his brother's policy was
carried on unchanged.</p><p>
James felt strong enough not to be afraid of Parliaments.



<pb id="p.298" n="298"/>      <note place="foot" n="3"><date value="1685">1685</date>-<date value="1685">1685</date></note>
Almost at once he summoned the Parliament of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>,
which passed an atrocious law that all who preached in
<note place="foot" n="4">Persecution in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, <date value="1685">1685</date>.</note>
an indoor " conventicle," and all who were present
at an open-air "conventicle" should be
punished with death. Claverhouse and his brutal dragoons
carried out to the letter this fierce policy, and many martyrs,
such as John Brown, the "Christian carrier," and Margaret
Wilson, a young girl drowned at a stake in the Solway, laid
down their lives for the Covenant.
The same stern policy found strangely different victims
in England. The victims of the Popish Plot were now
avenged by the condemnation of the scoundrels who had
sworn away their lives. The informers, Oates and Dangerfield,
were tried, condemned, and whipped so severely that
Oates barely got over it, and Dangerfield, who was ill-treated
by the mob, died of his punishment. Nor were more
respectable men spared. Richard Baxter, the venerable
leader of the moderate Presbyterians, was put into prison
for complaining of the persecution of the Dissenters.
He was condemned by Chief Justice Jeferies, a shrewd
Welshman, and an able but brutal and foul-tongued OldBailey
lawyer, who had got the Chief Justiceship and
a peerage as a reward for his clever advocacy and his
servile condemnation of the enemies of the Court.</p><p>
On 19th May the English Parliament met. "Great
industry had been used to obtain elections which might
<note place="foot" n="5">The Parliament of <date value="1685">1685</date>.
</note>promote the Court interest, most of the corporations
being now by their new charters
empowered to make what returns of members they pleased."
The high Tories were in an enormous majority, and voted
the king a revenue of I,9oo,ooo a year for life; a sum that
almost made him independent of Parliaments. But James
wished to play a leading part abroad. He was not content,
like his brother, to stand aside while Louis of<placeName key="France">France</placeName> went
on in the career of aggression that was now reaching its
climax. "I have a true English heart," he boasted to
the assembled Estates, "as jealous of the honour of the
nation as ever you can be." The French were in some
alarm, for if James and his Parliament continued of one
mind, England might, even under a Catholic king, join
<placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, the Emperor, and the Pope himself, to bring down
the power of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>.  But James was too absorbed in
his home plans to do without Louis for the present. He
became, like Charles, the French king's pensioner, though
he chafed bitterly under his slavery.



  <pb id="p.299" n="299"/>
</p><p>3. The peaceful accession of James filled the little knot
of Whig exiles in Holland with despair. The more reckless
of them, duped by Robert Ferguson the Plotter, and misled
by their friends at home, planned an invasion, and despite
the efforts of the Prince of Orange, two little expeditions
were fitted out. The first was destined for <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, and
was led by the Earl of Argyll, but he was foolishly put
under a committee, among whom were two obstinate and
ignorant Lowland gentlemen, Hume of Polwarth, and
Cochrane, and the brave old Cromwellian Rumbold. They
loitered so long upon their journey that when
<note place="foot" n="6">Argyll's Rebellion, <date value="1685">1685</date>.</note>
they reached the coasts of Cantyre, the chiefs
of the Campbell clan had been removed to distant prisons.
At Campbelltown Argyll issued a proclamation declaring
that King James had murdered King Charles, and that
Monmouth was the rightful James VII. The faithful clansmen
soon began to flock to the Maccallum More's great
standard, on which was written, " For God and Religion,
against Popery, Tyranny, Arbitrary Power and Erastianism.
" But Hume and Cochrane thought meanly of Highlanders,
and insisted on dividing the little force, and
raising Cameronian Ayrshire. On their shameful failure
they again joined Argyll in Bute. English frigates now cut
off their retreat, and kept Argyll from attacking Inverary,
his old home. In despair the earl agreed to march through
Dumbartonshire on Glasgow, but his followers melted away
without any real fighting, and he was taken prisoner, and
on 20th June led through Edinburgh "bareheaded, and his
hands behind his back, the guards with cocked matches,
and the hangman walking before him." Ten days later he
was executed on the old sentence of I68x, loudly declaring
on the scaffold his hatred of " Popery, Prelacy, and all
superstition." Rumbold had already suffered the same fate.
The brutal devastation of the Campbells' country put out
the last embers of the revolt.</p><p>
4. Monmouth, impatient of exile, and puffed up with vain
hopes, put himself at the head of the English expedition.
On Ith June he landed at Lyme in Dorsetshire,
along with Lord Grey, Ferguson, and the
<note place="foot" n="7">Monmouth'sRebellion, <date value="1685">1685</date>.</note>
fiery Scottish republican Andrew Fletcher of Salton. The
townsfolk at once gathered round his standard, shouting.
"A Monmouth and the Protestant religion." A silly and
wicked Declaration, written by Ferguson, was issued,
claiming that Monmouth was Charles's lawful son, and
rightful king of England, promising a free Parliament,



<pb id="p.300" n="300"/>    <note place="foot" n="8"><date value="1685">1685</date>-<date value="1685">1685</date></note>
and denouncing James as a usurper that had poisoned
the late king.   The first fight with the royalist militia,
near Bridport, was not successful, and Fletcher, having
killed a man in a passion, had to return to the Continent.
Monmouth then advanced northwards, through
Chard, to Taunton, where the sons of the stout townsmen
who had defended the town under Blake gave
him a hearty welcome. But though the common people
received him gladly, the Whig gentry held aloof. In the
vain hope of attracting them, Monmouth had himself proclaimed
king on that very 20th June on which Argyll was
led captive through the long High Street of Edinburgh.
Next day he advanced to Bridgwater, where the peasants
flocked to him in such numbers that he had to send many
away for the lack of arms. He went quickly on through
Glastonbury and Shepton Mallet to Keynsham, a little town
about five miles east of Bristol, but, fearing to attack that
great city, turned off up the Avon. Bath, like Bristol, closed
its gates on him. At Phitip5's Norton, a little to the south,
he had the best of a sharp skirmish against his half-brother,
the Duke of Grafton, a rough, shrewd sailor, and the best of
<persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.'s sons. He then reached Frome, but the king's
army now gathered against him, and he fell back on his old
quarters at Bridgwater, while the regular forces encamped
on Sedgnoor, a little to the east of the town. The latter
were commanded by Louis Duras, Earl of Feversham,
nephew of Turenne, the great French general, and under
<note place="foot" n="9">The Battle of Sedgmoor,6 July.</note>
him by John, Lord Churchill, the most rising
soldier of his time, and powerful at Court from
the favour enjoyed by his sister Arabella with
the king.   Waiting was as useless as more purposeless
wandering, so Monmouth resolved to attack at once.
</p><p>About midnight, on the night of the 5th-6th July, Monmouth's army of
cloth-workers, ploughmen, and miners marched out of Bridgwater. A
dense fog overspread the marshes, but the rebel army marched in long
file along the causeways which spanned the two broad rhines (ditches)
that separated them from Feversham's headquarters at the village of
Weston Zoyland. But they fell into some disorder, were observed, and
as they charged forwards to meet the king's troops, found, to their surprise,
a new stream, the broad Bussex Rhine between them and the
enemy. A fierce musketry fire was exchanged between the two banks.
Grey, with his cavalry, fled in alarm, but the raw infantry fought long
and gallantly, though soon out-flanked and out-generalled, and with no
better weapons than the butt-ends of their muskets and scythes fastened
upon long poles. But at last they were overpowered, and broke to
rally no more.



  <pb id="p.301" n="301"/>
</p><p>Monmouth had already left the field, and was captured a
few days later in the New Forest, skulking in a dry ditch
covered with bracken. He was brought to London, where
he had already been attainted by Parliament. With cold-blooded
cruelty James had an interview with his nephew,
but Monmouth's abject entreaties for pardon were all in
vain. On i5th July he was beheaded on Tower Hill.</p><p>
The most bloodthirsty vengeance was wreaked on the
wretched rebels. The coarse and brutal Colonel Kirke of
the Tangier Regiment slew many by martial
<note place="foot" n="10">The Bloody Assize.</note>
law immediately after the victory.  Chief-Justice
Jefferies went specially on the Western Circuit, or,
as men afterwards called it, the Bloody Assize. " He made
all the west an Aceldama; some places quite depopulated,
and nothing in them but forsaken walls, unlucky gibbets,
and ghostly carcasses. The trees were loaden almost as
thick with quarters as leaves, the houses and steeples
covered as close with heads as at other times with crows
or ravens." More than 300 were hanged; more than 800
transported as white slaves to the planters of Jamaica and
Barbados. Among the victims were two aged women,
Alice Lisle, widow of one of Cromwell's lords, beheaded at
Winchester for affording shelter to two fugitives, and <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
Gaunt, a pious and charitable Baptist, burnt alive at
Tyburn on a like charge. On his return, Jefferies was
rewarded with the Lord Chancellorship.</p><p>
5. James was now at the height of his power. The Tories
and Churchmen had made him king and had enabled him
to put down formidable rebellions. He was so delighted
with his successes that he soon formed vast plans for the
future. He had hitherto allowed his religion to remain
under the disabilities which it had so long suffered from.
But he felt that he was now so strong that he might look
forward to a time when it would be no longer a penal
offence to be of the same religion as the king. Visions of
the ultimate triumph of Catholicism now floated before his
mind, and, with true Stewart ignorance of human nature, he
believed that he could still count upon the support of the
Churchmen and Tories, when attacking all that they held
most sacred.  Side by side with schemes for the restoration
of Catholicism, James formed designs for winning back
the old power of the crown. He asked Parliament for an
increased standing army, and for the repeal of the Test
Act. If these measures were obtained, he hoped also to
get the Habeas Corpus Act done away with.   But his



<pb id="p.302" n="302"/>      <note place="foot" n="11"><date value="1688">1688</date>--<date value="1687">1687</date></note>
very ministers protested. Halifax, who had saved him his
throne, was turned out of office.  Parliament petitioned
<note place="foot" n="12">Breach between James and the Parliament.
</note>the king against breaking the Test Act, and
even among the Lords the opposition rose
high.  In disgust, James got rid of his
Parliament in November <date value="1685">1685</date>,
and, not deterred by his
father's fate, sought to get from servile judges decisions that
would avoid the necessity of going again before the indignant
Commons. The price of this was a breach with the
Tory party. The Lord Treasurer, Laurence Hyde, Earl of
Rochester, the king's brother-in-law, who "swore like a
sutler and indulged in drinking," but was the head of the
Church party, found bit by bit that his influence was
gone. Henceforth James was ruled by the subtle Jesuit
Petre, the rough and boisterous Irishman, Richard Talbot,
Earl of Tyrconnel; and above all by Robert Spencer, Earl
of Sunderland. Sunderland, already Secretary of State, was
now also made President of the Council. He was a statesman
of remarkable foresight and ability, insinuating and
attractive in his policy, but cold-hearted, corrupt and unprincipled,
and though really a thorough unbeliever, he did
not scruple to turn Catholic to please the king. In his zeal
for Catholicism and absolutism, James gave up his plans
of playing a great part in Europe, and finally accepted his
dependence on Louis XIV. This was the more significant
as Louis was now execrated throughout the Protestant
world as the remorseless persecutor of the French Calvinists.
In <date value="1685">1685</date> he had revoked the Edict of Nantcs,
that had given Protestantism a right to exist in<placeName key="France">France</placeName>,
and was now perpetrating terrible cruelties on the unhappy
Huguenots, so that hundreds of thousands sought
refuge in Protestant lands, bringing with them their skill,
their trade, and their deep hatred of Popery. They were
warmly welcomed in England, where the strongest Churchmen,
in their sympathy for brother Protestants, forgot that
they were Calvinists and Presbyterians.</p><p>
6. James was now treading in his father's footsteps. He
no longer had a great party at his back, but strove with
the help of courtiers and dependents to carry out a policy
as purely personal as that of <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>., and more hated by
the mass of Englishmen than the worst of the "innovations"
of Laud. He now sought to attain his ends by a lavish use
of his Dispensing and Suspending Powers. Chief-Justice
Herbert and all the other judges but one decided in the
case of Sir Edward Hales, a Catholic colonel, that James



  <pb id="p.303" n="303"/>
had the right to dispense with the Test Act or any other
statute (June <date value="1686">1686</date>).
The army and Council were now filled
with Catholics. James pushed his dispensing power so
far as to force Catholics, despite a whole crowd of statutes,
into offices in the English Church.  He
suffered Obadiah Walker, a pervert, to turn
University College, Oxford, into a Romanist
<note place="foot" n="13">James's attempt to bring in
Popery,<dateRange from="1686" to="1688">1686-1688</dateRange>.
</note>seminary, and gave the Deanery of Christ-Church
to Massey, an avowed Catholic. In
<date value="1686-07">July 1686</date>, he
established a new Court of High Commission, in the teeth
of a statute of the Long Parliament, because he wanted to
use the royal supremacy to ruin the Church of which he
was the supreme governor. This illegal body suspended
Bishop Compton of London, a brother of the Earl of Northampton,
because he would not prevent his clergy preaching
against Popery. James now put men who were secretly
Papists into the vacant bishoprics. He gathered together
13,000 troops in a camp on Hounslow Heath to overawe
the Londoners. In <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> he replaced his elder brother-in-law
Clarendon, a strong Churchman, by the Catholic
Tyrconnel, who was pleased to act vigorously against
the Protestant English settlers.  Rochester, who had
long been powerless, was now forced to yield up the White
Staff of Treasurer. The Tory Churchmen of England
had never supposed the monarchy, which they had tried
to make strong, would use its power against them; but
they found it hard to eat their own words, and cast off their
own doctrine of non-resistance. There were also many
time-servers and place-hunters among them, who acquiesced
in all James's acts provided their own private interests were
let alone. Yet all the Tories were moved to a resistance
which was all the steadier because it was slow and faltering
at first. James turned for allies to the Dissenters whom he
had hitherto so harshly persecuted. He sought now to
unite Dissenters and Catholics against the dominant church.
In April <date value="1687">1687</date> he issued a Declaration of Indulgence,
in which by his own authority he declared that he had
suspended all the laws against both Roman Catholics and
Protestant Dissenters, who were henceforth to be allowed to
worship publicly.  He granted a measure of toleration
even in <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, thus making the Scots Episcopalians
as angry as English Churchmen. A few Nonconformists,
like the courtly Quaker William Penn, took the bait, but
the mass of them proved as staunch as the Churchmen
to the Protestant cause, and were not won over by the



<pb id="p.304" n="304"/>    <note place="foot" n="14"><date value="1688">1688</date>--<date value="1688">1688</date></note>
prospect of illegal toleration, offered in the interests of
Popery.  Nor were James's other acts calculated to reassure
Protestant opinion.  His new High Commission
Court acted with ill-advised vigour. It deprived the Vice-Chancellor
of Cambridge of his headship of his college
for objecting to a monk named Francis proceeding to the
degree of M.A. without taking the usual oaths. At Oxford
it turned out nearly all the Fellows of Magdalen College
because they refused to elect a Popish President at James's
dictation.</p><p>
7. Public feeling now rose so high that James was afraid
to call a new Parliament. The crisis came when he issued
a second Declaration of Indulgence and gave orders that it
<note place="foot" n="15">The Declaration	of Indulgence and the Seven Bishops, <date value="1688">1688</date>.
</note>should be read in all churches on the first two
Sundays in June <date value="1688">1688</date>. Archbishop Sancroft, a
pious but narrow-minded man, and an extreme
churchman, with high Tory views about
non-resistance, was much concerned at the proclamation.
He took council with six of his brethren-Ken, Bishop
of Bath and Wells (the holiest and most upright of all the
bishops and the writer of the Morning and Evening Hymns),
White of Peterborough, Trelawney of Bristol (a straightforward
and vigorous Cornish baronet of large estate),
Lloyd of St. Asaph, Turner of Ely, and Lake of Chichester.
The Seven Bishops agreed to petition the king not to force
the clergy to break the law. While Sancroft remained at
Lambeth, the other six visited James at Whitehall and
presented their petition.  James rebuked them for raising
a standard of rebellion. "Did ever," he asked, "a good
Churchman question the Dispensing Power before?"
Angry on finding that their petition had been printed and
widely circulated, and that, in consequence, hardly any of
the clergy read the Declaration, James sent the Bishops to
the Tower on a charge of publishing a seditious libel. On
June 3oth they were acquitted, amidst the wild joy of
Whigs and Tories, Churchmen and Dissenters. But on the
Ioth of June a son had been born to James, whose second
marriage with Mary of Modena had for many years been
childless. The mob believed that this new Prince of
<placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> was a mere changeling brought in to prevent the
succession going to the Princess of Orange. Grave men
took counsel together, fearing that "the Popish tyranny"
would not now be limited to the life of an elderly man. On
the very day of the acquittal of the Seven Bishops, seven
leading Whigs and Tories united in a letter inviting William



   <pb id="p.305" n="305"/>
of Orange to bring a Dutch army into England to save the
nation from Popery and arbitrary power. The seven signers
of the invitation were the Earl of Devonshire, a great Whig
nobleman, the Earl of Shrewsbury, a rising young statesman
on the same side, Danby, staunchest of Churchmen and
Tories, the injured and indignant Bishop Compton, Admiral
Edward Russell, cousin of the Whig martyr Lord Russell,
Henry Sidney, brother of Algernon, and Lord Lumley</p><p>
8. A great European war was just breaking out, for
Louis XIV.'s aggressions had become more barefaced than
ever after his triumph at Nijmegen. Since <date value="1686">1686</date><persName key="William III">William III</persName>.,
still leader of the Anti-French party in Europe, had formed
the League of Augsburg against Louis, and lately fresh
causes of dispute had arisen which forced on the war. The
Dutch frontiers had to be defended, but the Great Elector
sent enough Brandenburg troops for this purpose, and
Louis made the great mistake of beginning the war by
attacking the Palatinate far away from Holland. After
this <persName key="William III">William III</persName>., who thought he could never beat the
French if England ceased to be Protestant,
<note place="foot" n="16">wiliamm.'s Invasion and Triumph, <date value="1688">1688.</date></note>
hesitated no longer.  On Ioth October he
issued a declaration that he would come to
England to secure a free Parliament. The first time he set
sail bad weather drove him back, but his second attempt
succeeded. A "Protestant wind" blew his ships down
the Channel, while it kept James's fleet in the Thames.
On 5th November he landed at Brixham in Torbay, and
marched to Exeter, where Mary's Whig chaplain Dr. Burnet
read the prince's declaration in the cathedral, and many
whose friends had suffered at the Bloody Assizes began
to flock to his flag. The gentry and nobility of the west
soon followed them. All over England men rose for
William, Danby joining Devonshire in organising revolt
in the north.</p><p>
When tidings arrived of his son-in-law's threatened invasion,
James strove to win back some of his angry subjects
by giving up the Ecclesiastical Commission, and by some
other concessions. But it was too late, and nothing was
left but fighting, if he wished to hold his own. Feversham
now marched westwards as far as Salisbury with James's
army, where, on 19th November, he was joined by the king.
Thereupon William left Exeter and pushed eastwards.
At Wincanton a skirmish was fought between William's
advanced guard of English troops under Mackay, and
James's hated Irish soldiers under Sarsfield, in which the







<pb id="p.306" n="306"/> <note place="foot" n="17"><date value="1688">1688</date>--<date value="1689">1689</date> </note>

latter were beaten.  The faithless and selfish Churchill,
though he owed everything to his master, deserted to the
Dutch, taking with him the Duke of Grafton. Churchill's
patroness, the Princess Anne, James's second daughter,
joined the northern insurgents, being escorted by her old
tutor Bishop Compton, in a buff coat and jack boots. The
royal army had no heart for the cause, and melted away
without fighting before William's steady advance through
Salisbury to Hungerford. James fled to London, thinking to
make terms with his nephew, but the negotiations at Hungerford
broke down, and the king, losing heart, tried to fly in
disguise. Riots broke out in London. The Catholic chapels
were plundered or burnt by the furious Protestants, and
mob rule was to be feared. The Lords now took the
government into their own hands, to prevent anarchy.
Meanwhile James had been stopped by some Kentish
fishermen near Sheerness, and slunk back to London. But
William with his army was now at hand, and on 18th
December James fled a second time to Rochester, whence
he reached<placeName key="France">France</placeName> safely.</p><p>
  9. William now entered London amid much rejoicing,
but with his triumph his real difficulties began. As there
was no king to issue the writs for a Parliament, a Convention,
like that which brought back <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>., was called.
This was in all but name a real Parliament. It met on 22nd
January <date value="1689">1689</date>, and proved strongly Whig. The debates
were long and keen. Now that the flight of James had
removed the fear of Popery, many of the Tories went back
to their old notions of Divine Right, and scrupled to deprive
James of his throne. Sancroft and the High Tories
shrank from laying violent hands on the " Lord's Anointed,"
<note place="foot" n="18">The Convention,<date value="1689">1689</date>.
</note>and wished to make William regent, and still
call James king. Danby and the moderate
Tories insisted that James had ended his own reign by his
own act, and that Mary became as next heir Queen of
England, but this course required some proof that the
infant<persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName></persName> was a changeling. William's friends
advised him to take upon himself the throne by right of
conquest, but wiser counsels prevailed. At last the Convention
voted that James had violated the original contract
between king and people by breaking the fundamental
laws, had abdicated by withdrawing himself from the realm,
and that the throne was therefore vacant. They also drew
 <note place="foot" n="19">The Declarationof Right.</note>
up a Declaration of Right, which gave a list
of the chief illegal acts of James. On William
and Mary ratifying this, they were offered and accepted the






  <pb id="p.307" n="307"/>

throne as joint sovereigns, the real power of course resting
in William.</p><p>
  10. Thus was the "Glorious Revolution" completed
almost without bloodshed. It was so easily accomplished,
because the foolish attack of James on Protestantism had
left him without a party. In the Civil War the attack of
the Parliament on the Church had complicated the political
struggle with a religious one, and had thus given the throne
a strength which, on its own merits, it would not have had.
But now the whole nation was united, save for a handful of
Catholics, as it had never been united before. The Church
was now on the side of the Constitution as much as the
Puritans had ever been. The short reign of <persName key="James II">James II</persName>. had
proved the impossibility of the Tory policy of furthering
their party ends by magnifying the royal power. Successful
to some extent under a shrewd king like <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>., the
plan failed completely under an obstinate bigot like James I I.
The Tories saw that the king, whose favours they had felt
sure of, might do as much harm to Church and State as an
Oliver or a Shaftesbury. They dropped their unworkable
views, and the acts of the Convention established the Whig
teaching that the king is an official who may be removed, if
he does ill the work be is appointed to perform. The resolution
of the Convention had sought to please both Whigs
and Tories, by dwelling first upon James's abdication as
resulting from his bad government, and then by pretending
that he had withdrawn from the throne, from which the
Tories were unwilling to drive him. But it was essentially a
triumph of the Whig ideal ofgoverment. In effect it destroyed
the Tory doctrine that kings had an "indefeasible hereditary
divine right," and cut at the
<note place="foot" n="20">The Revolution Settlement.</note>
root the ideas which had set the king apart from his people,
as "God's special deputy, to resist whom were wicked and
unchristian."  When Church and State were really in
danger, all Englishmen, Whig and Tory, Churchmen and
Dissenter, banded themselves together in a great national
party to save Church and Constitution from Popery and
despotism. James had failed even more completely than
his father. His successors mounted the throne with a
Parliamentary title. With the triumph of the Constitution
came the final triumph of Protestantism. Now that Protestants
of all sorts had joined together against the Papists,
the policy of the Restoration had to be reversed by granting
religious liberty to all Protestants. The troublous seventeenth
century had ended with the victory of the Parliament and the Protestant Religion.</p>

  Foreign Trade and Colonies in the Seventeenth
                          Century</head>
<p>  1. The religious and political struggle which occupied
the Stewart period still left England at leisure to continue
in all directions the triumphal progress that
had begun under <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. Between the accession
<note place="foot" n="1">   England becomes a gret commercial and colonising nation</note>
 of <persName key="James I">James I</persName>. and the deposition of his
grandson, England became a great trading
and colonising nation.  In both of these
movements the first impetus came from the age of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>,
and in both subsequent progress was entirely on
Elizabethan lines.  Party strife affected it very little.
Puritan and Anglican, Cavalier and Roundhead, Whig
and Tory, each had their share in the work, and were all
content to carry it on in the same way. Cromwell followed
the policy of the king he supplanted, and <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. was
content to tread in the footsteps of the Usurper. A marvellous
continuity and harmony bound all classes and
creeds of Englishmen together in the work of making
their country great and feared.</p><p>
  2. Despite the vast growth of English commerce under
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, England was still far behind the United Provinces
as regards trade and navigation. The
<note place="foot" n="2">the foreigntrade of theSeven UnitedProvinces</note>
Dutch were the common-carriers of Europe,
supplying England with foreign wares of all
sorts. They had the chief command of those                 .
admirable schools for seamanship, the deep-sea fisheries off
the British coasts. They snapped up the remnants of the
decaying commerce of Portugal, when that land was conquered
by <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. Their scanty population forbade extensive
colonisation, but they planted numerous trading stations in
the East, in Africa and in America, which became in some
cases new homes for Dutchmen beyond the seas. They
commanded the Indian and African markets, even supplying
English colonies with negro slaves and England with
Oriental produce. Small as was their territory, they excelled
in manufactures, almost as much as in commerce; and
England depended on them, or the French, for most of
the finer sorts of manufactured wares. Yet there was no
field in which the Dutch excelled which England had
not already entered into for herself. Before long religious







<pb id="p.310" n="310"/>

and political friendship died away in the face of bitter
commercial rivalry. The one thought of English traders
was to imitate the Dutch, and, if possible, to excel them.
 </p><p> 3. The fight was fiercest in the East. In <date value="1600">1600</date> <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
gave a charter to the English East India Company, where-upon,
<note place="foot" n="3">The rivalry of England and Holland in the East.</note>
in <date value="1602">1602</date>, the various Dutch societies
trading in the Indies were consolidated into
the Dutch East India Company. A few years
later Batavia in Java was founded as a sort of
Oriental Amsterdam. It soon became the commercial centre
of the Hollanders' possessions in the archipelago of Further
India, and the great centre of the lucrative spice trade,
which the Dutch strove to keep in their own hands. This
led to fierce struggles with the daring English adventurers
who actively carried on a rival trade in the same district,
and by <date value="1619">1619</date> the Dutch were forced to patch up an agreement
which divided the Molucca islands between the
Dutch and English companies, and gave the English interlopers
a third of the produce. In accordance with this
treaty some English planters settled down in the little
island of Amboyna; but the Dutch settlers looked upon
them with extraordinary hatred, and in <date value="1623">1623</date>, on the pretence
that the English had conspired to take possession of
the fortified posts, laid violent hands upon them, murdered
some, and drove the rest from the island. This Amboyna
<note place="foot" n="4">The Amboyna Massacre, <date value="1623">1623</date>.
</note>Massacre excited the strongest indignation in
England, and from that moment the rivalry
of the merchants began to be taken up by the nation at
large. No sooner did the Treaty of Westphalia and the
fall of <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>. give both nations leisure to fight, than
they eagerly went to war with each other. We have
already traced the history of the Navigation
<note place="foot" n="5">The NavigationAct and the struggle at sea </note>
Acts of <date value="1651">1651</date> and <date value="1660">1660</date>, and the three fierce
.maritime wars of <dateRange from="1652" to="1653">1652-3</dateRange>,<dateRange from="1664" to="1666">
1664-6</dateRange>, and<dateRange from="1672" to="1673"> 1672-3</dateRange>.
[see pages 256, 280 and 285]. Though the Dutch held their
own well in the actual fighting, they were, nevertheless,
gradually overborne by the greater resources and enterprise
of English traders.  The Navigation Acts, despite some
temporary inconveniences, did their work admirably by
rearing up a great school of English seamen, and before
the end of the century England had not only got the
whole of its trade with its colonies and foreign customers
in its own hands, but had won a good share in the deep-sea
fisheries, and was becoming a successful rival for the
general carrying-trade of the world.  The triumph of






       <pb id="p.311" n="311"/>

England was hastened by the Dutch needing English help
against Louis XIV. When the Dutch stadtholder became
King of England, the close union between the two countries
meant the dependence of the Seven Provinces upon her
successful rival. It was characteristic of the tendency of
the age, that the century which began with wars of religion
ended with wars between peoples of the same religion who
differed in matters of trade.</p><p>
  4. As a result of this triumph over the Dutch, English
factories were now set up all over Africa and Asia, and
English merchants grew rich with eastern
trade, especially in the prosperous times that
<note place="foot" n="6"> The English factories in India</note>
succeeded the Restoration. In <date value="1612">1612</date> the East  	   		         .
India Company set up its first factory at Surat, near the
mouth of the Tapti, one hundred and fifty miles north of
Bombay, and a little later established another at Hoogly, as
the depot for the rich trade of Bengal. Both these factories,
being in Northern India, were closely under the eye of the
Great Mogul, the Mohammedan potentate who ruled over
the greater part of India all through the seventeenth
century. Accordingly, in <date value="1639">1639</date>
the Company set up a
third station at Madras, on the Coromandel
coast, where the Mogul's power was weak,
<note place="foot" n="7"> Madras <date value="1639">1639</date></note>
and where they could set up for their protection a fortress,
mounted with cannon, which they called Fort St. George.
After <date value="1640">1640</date>, the revolt of
Portugal from <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> threatened
to renew a power which had of old claimed the monopoly
of Indian trade for itself, but even earlier than the Dutch
the Portuguese were forced to barter trade and lands in
distant continents for English support against overpowerful enemies
at home. In <date value="1661">1661</date>
they ceded their island of
Bombay to <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. as part of the marriage portion
of Catharine of Braganza, and in <date value="1668">1668</date> Charles
<note place="foot" n="8">Bombay <date value="1663">1663</date></note>
handed it over to the East India Company.
Its magnificent harbour, as well as the freedom from
the Mogul secured by its insular position, made its acquisition
a new starting-point in the history of the English
power in India, though the deadly malaria that arose
from its undrained swamps long made merchants prefer
to live at Surat. Bombay and Madras were thus fortified
territorial possessions as well as trading-factories.  In
<date value="1690">1690</date>, a friendly governor of Bengal permitted the
English, who had been unable to thrive
at Hoogly under the eye of the Mohammedan
<note place="foot" n="9"> Calcutta <date value="1690">1690</date>.</note>
lords of India, to buy three villages lower down the






<pb id="p.312" n="312"/>

river, where they built another armed factory, styled Fort
William, outside the walls of which grew up the native
town of Calcutta. These three towns became the centres
of the Company's work, each being ruled by a President
and a Council, so that they got to be called the Three
Presidency Towns. Other posts in the interior enabled
the British merchants to extend their commerce all over
India. They were able to leave the Dutch masters of
Ceylon and the great islands of the Archipelago, and
pursue their operations where Dutch rivalry was less dangerous.
However, a new and more formidable foe now
<note place="foot" n="10">The new rivlry of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>.</note>
arose in the French East India Company,
set up by Louis XIV. as part of his general
scheme for making<placeName key="France">France</placeName> a foremost commercial power.
Before the Revolution, fear of the French had begun to
take the place of fear of the Dutch, and the Dutch, who
shared fully in that fear, had in it another motive to keep
on friendly terms with the English.  But the struggle
between<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and England in India, as in America, was
not fought out until the next century.</p><p>
  5. Besides the East India Company other great chartered
associations carried on English trade in distant lands.
<note place="foot" n="11">Chartered Trading  Companies</note>.
Among these were the Eastland Company,
which competed with the Dutch for the trade
of the Baltic; the Muscovy or Russia Company, which,
following on the footsteps of Chancellor, pursued an active
commerce with the great Russian monarchy which towards
the end of the century was beginning to emerge from
barbarism through the genius of its Czar, Peter the Great;
and the Levant Company, which sought to continue such of
the old Venetian trade with the East by the way of Egypt
and Syria as the Turks still allowed. The Royal African
<note place="foot" n="12">West African Settlements.</note>
Company, set up in its final form in <date value="1672">1672</date> by
<persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>., followed up the warfare which its
three predecessors had waged against the Dutch. This
struggle had been very fierce after the passing of the Navigation Act,
when the English, after a desperate struggle,
took the slave trade with our West Indian colonies out
of the Dutch hands, after long disputes that were among
the principal causes of the war of <date value="1665">1665</date> [see p. 280].
By the Peace of Breda the English acquired Cape Coast
Castle, which long remained the chief of our settlements
on the pestilential coast of West Africa. The African
companies were not commercial successes, partly because
the need of cheap negroes in the West Indies prevented






          <pb id="p.313" n="313"/>

them from getting a monopoly of the trade, and partly
because the constant state of war between the negro
tribes, which was the condition of the slave trade, was an
unsurmountable obstacle in the way of legitimate commerce.
In Northern West Africa also, or Senegambia,
the English had to sustain the constant rivalry of the
French, and were not very fortunate.  In the extreme
south they were anticipated by the Dutch, who settled
round the Cape of Good Hope, as a good halfway house to
India. Feeling a similar need, the English India Company
set up an intermediate station of its own in the
remote island of St. Helena in <date value="1651">
1651</date>. It was by chartered
companies such as these that the first successful English
colonies were planted. Trading and colonisation now went
hand in hand. At nearly every point England had to fight
her way to win trade and colonies.</p><p>
  6. In the African tropics and amidst the teeming populations
  and ancient civilisations of Asia, colonisation in the
strict sense was almost impossible. A Colony,
or, as the English of the seventeenth century
<note place="foot" n="13">The need for  English Colonies.</note>
called it, a Plantation, does not mean simply a dependency
in a remote country. It suggests the actual settlement of a
branch of the colonising people within it. Such colonies
can only be established on a large scale when the population
in the mother country no longer finds easy subsistence
or easy outlet for its energies. This need of settling the
surplus population in plantations began to be felt with us
under <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, though, as we have seen, the projected
Elizabethan colonies were in all cases failures, whether
settled in distant lands, like Gilbert's Plantation of Newfoundland
or Raleigh's Plantation of Virginia, or in regions
so near home as Antrim or Munster. In the next generation,
however, colonisation was taken up with more success.
The desire for wealth and adventure inspired one class of
settlers. The wish to worship God after a fashion not permitted
at home led others to seek out new abodes beyond
sea. Before Raleigh left the Tower for the scaffold, the
first English colonies had become permanently established,

  7. While Spaniards and Portuguese had divided Southern
and Central America, the inhospitable north still lay vacant
for settlement. In <date value="1606">1606</date>
two companies of merchants were
incorporated by <persName key="James I">James I</persName>. for the purpose of colonising
America. One of these was an association of west of
England traders called the Plymouth Company, to which

was entrusted the settlement of the north. The other was
the London Company, whose sphere was to be in the

lands to the south of the projected Plymouth
plantation.  However, the western traders'
,attempt to settle in the lands afterwards called
New England proved completely unsuccessful,
and the London Company won the glory of establishing
the first permanent English colony.  The brave and
strenuous Puritan clergyman, Richard Hakluyt, who had
commemorated in his books the famous voyages of the last
reign, and Sir George Somers, an old hero of the Spanish
main, "a lamb on shore and a lion at sea," were the
organisers of the enterprise, but neither went with the
expedition.</p><p>

hundred and forty-three emigrants, bade adieu
to England.  The patriotic poet Drayton
wishing them good luck in his lines:</p><p>
                <quote rend="blockquote"> "Cheerfully at sea,
                 Success you still entice.
                 To get the pearl and gold,
                 And ours to hold
                 Virginia, earth's only Paradise."
</quote></p><p>
The voyage was long and tedious, and it was not until
May that the little band planted their first settlement,
which they called Jamestown, in honour of the English
king, on a peninsula between Chesapeake Bay and the
James river. Hakluyt had drawn up wise directions for the
colonists, but their nominal leaders were incompetent.
They wasted their energies in searching for gold instead
of tilling the soil, and they suffered terribly from disease,
famine, and the constant attacks of the Indian tribes.
Nothing but the skill and resource of Captain John Smith,
a boastful and reckless adventurer of great practical
wisdom, saved the colony from annihilation. At last the
incompetent leaders were deposed.  Smith was made
governor, and further shiploads of new colonists slowly
increased the numbers and prosperity of the infant
settlement. The most famous of these voyages was that
of Sir George Somers, with a fleet of nine vessels, in <date value="1609">1609</date>,
which was memorable by the wreck of Somers on the
Bermudas, often called the Somers Islands after him. The
company at home watched over the fortunes of the colony
with anxious care, but with too great an anxiety for







      <pb id="p.315" n="315"/>

immediate dividends. The severest discipline was found
necessary to force the thriftless and idle settlers to work for
their living, but gradually the first difficulties were overcome.
As the colonists grew more self-reliant, the company allowed
them more liberty. In <date value="1619">1619</date>
the period of military rule
was ended and a popular parliament was set up called the
House of Burgesses, which much more closely
represented the settlers than the House of
<note place="foot" n="15"> The constitution and early history of Virginia.</note>
Commons represented England. The executive
power went to the Governor, who had a veto on legislation;
and a Council, nominated by the Crown, in some wise
represented the House of Lords, though its members sat
with the Burgesses in a single house.  Thus Virginia
became governed by a constitution modelled on the English
fashion. In <date value="1624">1624</date>
<persName key="James I">James I</persName>. quashed the company's
charter, and took the government of Virginia into his own
hands. This step, which made the analogy with England
more complete, allowed the colony to work out its own
destinies unfettered by home direction. In religion as in
politics, Virginia followed England.  Its earlier settlers
were churchmen of the Calvinistic, half-Puritan sort, that
prevailed under <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, but they were intolerant of Independents
and Sectaries, and insisted on the Prayer Book
being used in all the churches of the colony. Gradually the
settlement assumed a distinct economic type. The land
became divided into large estates, owned by gentlemen
proprietors, many of them younger sons of good English
houses, who formed a governing aristocracy, living in rude
plenty on their isolated plantations. Their chief crop was
tobacco, of which they had a monopoly for supplying the
English market, and which became so abundant that it
was often used, instead of gold and silver, as currency.
Repeated attempts were made to enforce by law the growth
of corn and other food crops, as well as the breeding of
cattle and pigs, lest the colony should become dependent on
imported provisions, or suffer from periodical famines. The
tobacco plantations were tilled partly by imported servants,
bound by indenture to serve their masters for a term of
years, and partly by white slaves, either transported criminals,
vagrants, and political prisoners, or poor people,
kidnapped in England by vile speculators who sold them
to the planters. These were also bound to service for
varying terms of years. The native Indians were found
of little use as labourers, and from early times negro
slaves were brought over from Africa, but before the






<pb id="p.316" n="316"/>

Restoration their number was very small. The white
servants, when the term of service had expired, were not
of the right sort to make good yeomen farmers, and the
generous climate and the abundance of fertile land made it

<figure id="Fig.022" n="MS004.002.012.DO01.00022"><head>The English Colonies in North America under Charles II</head></figure>




easy for them to settle down in happy idleness and poverty,
the ancestors of the " mean whites " of later history. There
were few towns and little trade or manufactures, but every
plantation had a navigable river at its door, whence its





               <pb id="p.317" n="317"/>

tobacco was taken direct to Bristol or London. Despite
some grave drawbacks, the colony grew prosperous, and
the planter aristocracy, though infected with the laxity and
pride of its class, produced high-spirited and gallant gentlemen,
able to wage war in the House of Burgesses against
an unpopular governor, or secure the direction of affairs on
the lines of which they themselves approved. The Virginians
had little interest in the struggle between <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>. and
his Parliaments, but in <date value="1649">1649</date>
they indignantly refused to be
ruled by an Independent Commonwealth, and proclaimed
<persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>., declaring that the "late most pious king" was
"deserving of altars and monuments in the hearts of all
good men." But they yielded at once to the two warships
sent out by the Rump to enforce their surrender, though
they gladly welcomed the Restoration.</p><p>
  8. The success of the Virginia Plantation made it the first
of a long series. The most important of these was the result
of very different motives from those which
had inspired the adventurers that had peopled
Virginia. The small and unpopular minority
<note place="foot" n="16">The Separatist Church at Scrooby and its migration, <dateRange from="1608" to="1620">1608-1620</dateRange></note>
of Independent Separatists in England had
hard work to make headway against the persecutions
of Whitgift and <persName key="James I">James I</persName>. Despairing of England,
the members of the Independent congregation at Scrooby
in north Nottinghamshire, near the <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName> boundary,
migrated in <date value="1608">1608</date> to Holland.
After a few years their poor
prospects in an overpopulated foreign land turned their
attention to America, and they bargained with the Virginia
Company for permission to settle in its territories. The
Plymouth Company had now been revived. The indefatigable
John Smith had explored its old sphere north of Virginia,
had given the region the name of New England, and had
strongly urged its importance as a fishing station, and as a
possible centre for a new settlement. In <date value="1620">1620</date>
the Pilgrim Fathers, as they were afterwards
called, crossed over to Southampton, and,
<note place="foot" n="17">The Pilgrim Fathers and the voyage of the Mayflower, <date value="1620">1620</date>.</note>
adding to their number a few English brethren,
sailed from that port, a little more than a hundred in
number, in the Mayflowerand another smaller craft. Chance
drove them ashore far north of Virginia, but they determined
to take up their settlement there. Landing near
Cape Cod, they planted their first abodes on the mainland
on the western side of Cape Cod Bay, which Smith had
already called Plymouth. At first they had to contend
with terrible difficulties, and more than half the little band





<pb id="p.318" n="318"/>

perished of cold and famine during the first severe New Eng
land winter. But the Sectaries had perseverance and en
thusiasm, and being already accustomed to act
<note place="foot" n="18">The PlymouthSettlement,<date value="1620">1620</date>.</note>
together, were easier to discipline and control
than the scattered units who made up the first
colonists of Virginia. At first they constituted but a single
family, having the land and all their goods in common. In
a few years, however, they gave up their socialism, and
settled down each man in his own solid log-built homestead,
with his little farm, and his own cattle pasturing in the
common meadow. At first, too, the whole community met
together to pass laws, but gradually the principle of representation
prevailed and a local parliament grew up. The
Plymouth settlement never became important, but the halo
of poetry and legend, with which New England sentiment
has surrounded its doings, will ever keep its memory
green.</p><p>
  9. After the success of the Plymouth plantation, many
isolated and independent settlements gradually grew up
<note place="foot" n="19"><note place="foot" n="20">The Massachusetts Company and the Massachusetts, <date value="1629">1629</date>. </note>
</note>in New England. The small settlements of
fishermen north of Piscataqua Bay became
the nucleus of the later New Hampshire and
Maine, and some traders from Dorchester
set up in <date value="1623">1623</date> a small settlement at Cape Ann
in Massachusetts Bay, between these plantations and Plymouth.
The Dorchester Settlement proved a failure, but in
<date value="1629">1629</date> a royal charter established a new colonising corporation
called the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts
Bay in New England. Under the auspices of this company
a colony on a large scale was organised, under strict discipline
and with a definitely Puritan tinge. It was backed
by many men of wealth, influence, and position, and successfully
carried out on a large scale the ideas which the Plymouth
pilgrims had realised in their humbler way. From
its efforts dates the real settlement of New England. In
<date value="1630">1630</date> the government of the colony was transferred from
England to America, and John Winthrop, a <placeName key="Suffolk">Suffolk</placeName> landowner
of great wisdom and moderation, went out as its first
resident governor. The first capital was Charlestown, on
the north bank of the Charles River, named in honour of the
new English king, but it was soon deserted for Boston, a
healthier site on the south side of the same stream. Though
the first emigrants were not all Separatists, they quickly
drifted into Independency in their new home. In <date value="1631">1631</date> they
passed a law that no man should have political rights, unless




       <pb id="p.319" n="319"/>

he were a member of an Independent church. They ruthlessly
expelled those who used the Prayer Book, along
with "Antinomians and libertines."  They escaped from
the fetters of bishops and High Commission in England,
only to forge still heavier chains for all who settled with
them beyond the Atlantic.</p><p>
  10. In <date value="1631">1631</date> a young
  Welshman, Roger Williams, landed
in Massachusetts Bay, and was soon made minister of the
important town of Salem. He was a quickwitted,
<note place="foot" n="21">Roger Williama and the settlement atProvidence, <date value="1636">1636</date></note>
 good-natured, pugnacious, self-centred,
and restless enthusiast, without much perseverance,
balance, or practical wisdom, and dominated by
abstract theories, according to which he wished
to reform his own life and that of his fellows. He was
almost the first Englishman who joined to Separatist principles
the doctrine that the State had nothing to do with
the Church, and he soon revolted from the state-church of
Massachusetts as vehemently as he had revolted from the
state-church in England.  After scandalising all parties
he was expelled from the colony. In <date value="1636">1636</date> he made his
way southward to the shores of Narragansett Bay to the
west of the Plymouth plantation, where he bought land of the
Indians and established a new colony called Providence,
on the basis of absolute religious liberty and the complete
withdrawal of the State from all ecclesiastical concerns.
He now adopted Anabaptist views, and was baptized by
immersion with many of his followers. In <date value="1647">1647</date>
Providence united with three neighbouring
townships to form the colony of Rhode Island,
<note place="foot" n="22">Rhode Island established, <date value="1647">1647</date>.
</note>which remained, however, a federation in which each of
the four townships retained its local liberty. So strongly
did Williams's principles prevail, that Rhode Island, alone
of the colonies, refused to condemn men of any race to
permanent slavery, and even the appearance of the Quakers
did not cause it to depart from its horror of religious persecution.
In <date value="1638">1638</date>
the scattered settlements of emigrants
from Massachusetts at Hartford, in the valley of the Connecticut
river, were united in a new colony
with a thoroughly democratic constitution that
only imposed the test of church membership
on its governor. In <date value="1639">1639</date> a separate colony
<note place="foot" n="23">Plantation ofConnecticut, <date value="1638">1638</date>, and New Haven, <date value="1639">1639</date>.
</note>was established at Newhaven, more to the west, on the
coast opposite Long Island Sound. Here as in Massachusetts
the identity of Church and State was upheld by
church membership being made the condition of citizen.

ship. Further progress westward was barred by the Dutch
interlopers, who, reckless of English claims, had raised their
settlement of the New Netherlands at the mouth of the
Hudson, while to the north the French settlements of
Canada and Acadie forbade progress in a region uninviting
through its rigorous climate.  The colonisation of New
<note place="foot" n="24">The federation of the four colonies, <date value="1643">1643</date>
</note>England was now complete, and in <date value="1642">1642</date> Massachusetts,
Plymouth, Connecticut, and NewHaven
united in a rude confederation, called
the United Colonies of New England, from which, however,
tolerant and rebel Rhode Island was excluded.
</p><p>  11. The New England colonies became a group by themselves,
both by reason of their climate and soil, and through
<note place="foot" n="25">Characteristics of the New England settlements.
</note>the circumstances of their settlement. Nature
made impossible the cultivation of tobacco,
and the land was tilled not in great plantations,
but in small farms,	whose yeomen proprietors lived
together in villages, cultivating their fields with little help
outside their family. There was thus neither a wealthy
aristocracy nor a depressed proletariat. The rude climate
and soil required a fiercer struggle for existence than in
the south, and stimulated the energy which the Puritan
emigrants brought with them. The settlers traded with
the Indians and with the southern and tropical colonies,
whose wants they soon learned how to supply. They built
ships and supplemented agriculture by fisheries. They
lived a free and vigorous but quarrelsome and narrow life,
prizing their practical independence of the mother country,
and their democratic institutions, which in some cases
allowed them even to appoint their own governor. The
Church was the basis of the State, and the township or
organised community grew naturally out of the ecclesiastical
organisation. The settlers kept at arm's-length the
unsatisfactory elements that will always flow into a new
country, by the rule that confined citizenship to churchmembers,
and by refusing to admit the criminal or the
outcast within the sacred fold. If they made little use of
penal servants from the old country, and less of negro
slaves, it was not because they had (save the Rhode
Islanders) any scruples in the matter, but because the
economical circumstances of the country made such assistance
of little use. They ruthlessly swept away the native
Indians, regarding them as the children of Israel regarded
the Canaanites. They were not, however, mere religious
enthusiasts, but hard-headed men of business. Both the





       <pb id="p.321" n="321"/>

Plymouth and the Massachusetts settlers had enough of
the wisdom of the serpent to keep in the background their
separatist tendencies when seeking charters and favours of
the English king, though, when once established in the New
World, they exercised an iron discipline that might well
have excited Laud's envy; and, at a time when the English
Separatists were demanding freedom of worship and toleration
as a right, most of the New England colonies zealously
strove to root out all dissent from Puritanism and Independency.
Their stern, strenuous, thrifty, unlovely character
made them admirable colonists. In a quiet way they soon
began to thrive exceedingly and multiply rapidly. Nor were
brighter aspects of their character wanting. They showed
from the first great care for education, and ordered that
schools should be set up in every populous township. In
<date value="1636">1636</date> Massachusetts established a college at a
place near Boston, which they called Cambridge,
<note place="foot" n="26"> Preponderance ofMassachusetts.</note>
 while they soon gave the college the name of its
liberal benefactorJohn Harvard. The printing press was
early at work, and despite constant theological wrangles, and
hideous persecutions of witches, Antinomians, Anabaptists,
and Quakers, Massachusetts became the intellectual centre
of New England. It was also politically the dominant
partner in the federation, and its aggressions were anxiously
watched by its weaker neighbours.  It absorbed New
Hampshire and Maine as its dependencies, and constantly
threatened Rhode Island. Newhaven also united itself
with Connecticut, thus reducing the number of separate
colonies. The Great Rebellion called some of the fiercer
spirits back to the old country; and it is characteristic of
the temper of New England that Puritan extremists like
Sir Harry Vane and Hugh Peters received part of their
political training in that colony.  By the middle of the
century it was computed that there were eighty thousand
Englishmen dwelling in New England.</p><p>
  12. At the time of <persName key="James I">James I</persName>.'s breach with <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, George
Calvert, a disciple of Robert Cecil's, gave up his Secretaryship
of State, became a Roman Catholic and
Lord Baltimore, and devoted the remainder
<note place="foot" n="27">Lord Baltimore and the Plantation of Maryland, <date value="1632">1632</date>.</note>
of his life to "that ancient, primitive, and
heroic work of planting the world." His first
project was to settle Gilbert's abandoned plantation of Newfoundland,
and in <date value="1623">1623</date> he sent colonists thither, going there
himself in <date value="1627">1627</date>. But the inclemency of the climate, and
the hostility of the Puritan fishermen to a Papist lord,








<pb id="p.322" n="322"/>
induced Baltimore to remove with all his colonists to a
more genial and less suspicious region. Repulsed from
Jamestown by the Virginian settlers, because he would not
take the Oath of Supremacy, Baltimore went back to England,
where he died in <date value="1632">1632</date>. A few weeks after his death,
<persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>. granted a charter to his son Cecil Calvert, the
second Lord Baltimore, which gave him absolute proprietary
rights over a large territory north of the Potomac, on both
shores of the upper part of Chesapeake Bay. The district
was called Maryland, in honour of <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>.'s queen, and
two chief features marked out the enterprise. Maryland
was the first Proprietary Colony, the lordship over which
was exercised by a great landlord, who had complete
royal rights within his estate after the feudal fashion,
like the ancient Earls Palatine or the Lords Marcher in
<placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName>. It was, moreover, destined for the settlement of
Roman Catholics, whose lot in England was not less hard
than that of the Separatists.  However, it was impossible
for any English king to agree to set up a Catholic
state, and <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName> in the Maryland charter tied Baltimore's
hands by providing that all churches in the colony should
be devoted to the service of the Church of England, which
was thus made the official Church. Baltimore was able,
however, to secure toleration for the Catholics, who largely
composed the early population, though it was not till <date value="1649">1649</date>
that legal provision was made for religious liberty. The
northern neighbour of Virginia, Maryland resembled the
older colony in its economic conditions, though there was
deadly hostility between them, and the free planter aristocracy
formed a very different sort of government from that
of the lord of Maryland. To the north the new colony
approached the New Netherlands, which centred round the
Hudson valley and blocked the prospects of a continued
series of English colonies along the east coast.</p><p>
  13. Besides the two great groups of colonies on the mainland, the
first half of the seventeenth century saw the establishment of numerous
<note place="foot" n="28">The Bermudas <date value="1612">1612</date>.
</note>English settlements in the islands adjacent to America.
Early among them was the Plantation of the Bermudas,
first settled in <date value="1612">1612</date>, and ruled from <date value="1615">1615</date> to
<date value="1684">1684</date> by the Governors and Company of the City of London for the
Plantation of the Somer Islands. The colony flourished exceeedingly,
and was famous for its beautiful climate, where, as Waller sang:
        <quote rend="blockquote">So sweet the air, so moderate the clime,
          None sickly lives, or dies before his time;
          Heaven sure has kept this spot of earth uncurst
          To show how all things were created first."
</quote>




         <pb id="p.323" n="323"/>

The colony received a representative assembly only one year later
than Virginia, and, including negroes and white bondservants, had
about three thousand inhabitants before <date value="1660">1660</date>.
</p><p>
  14. The Lesser Antilles, as the more eastern West
Indian Islands are called, had been among the first of
Columbus' discoveries, but their small size and the absence
of gold caused the Spaniards to pass them by.
<note place="foot" n="29"> The West Indies</note>
In the early part of the seventeenth century
they gradually attracted settlers from all the chief maritime
nations. The Dutch, who aimed only at trade, occupied
some, though they preferred for their purpose the mainland
of South America and the islands adjacent to it.
The English and French, more intent on cultivating the
soil, found the small size, fertility, and easiness of access
of the West India islands exceedingly attractive to them.
In <date value="1605">1605</date> some English sailors landed at Barbados, and
claimed the island as English, though the first settlers
came there in <date value="1625">1625</date>. Even before that the
English had colonised St. Kitts, alongside
<note place="foot" n="30">Barbadoes and St. Kitts, <date value="1625">1625</date>.</note>
with a French settlement, the two peoples agreeing to
be at peace, even when<placeName key="France">France</placeName> and England were at
war. From this partial settlement of one little island a
constant stream of English colonists overflowed into the
other northern or Leeward Islands; Nevis and Barbuda
being settled in <date value="1628">1628</date>, and
Antigua and Montserrat in <date value="1632">1632</date>,
the latter two by Irish Catholics. In the larger Windward
Islands, more to the south, the Carib natives were formidable foes,
and there the French, who got on better with
them, made more progress than the English. <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>.
granted all the " Caribbean Islands" to James Hay, Earl
of Carlisle: and fierce disputes between the proprietor
and other claimants checked their progress. After Carlisle's
death his rights were sold to Lord Willoughby of
Parham, who after fighting for the Parliament against
<persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>., went out to Barbados after <date value="1649">1649</date>, and upheld
the cause of <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. so vigorously, that, alone of the
royalist colonies, Barbados gave the ships of the Rump considerable
trouble to reduce it. The tropical climate of the
West Indies unfitted them for the products or the labour
of temperate climes. At first the West India islands grew
tobacco, but the climate was unsuited to it, and they
gradually made the sugar cane, introduced from Brazil,
their main crop. These islands were the first English
colonies to make extensive use of negro slave-labour,







<pb id="p.324" n="324"/>
though white bond-slaves were also largely employed in
the Barbados plantations all through the seventeenth
century. Thousands of prisoners, especially Scots and
Irish, were shipped off to this miserable fate by Cromwell
and the Long Parliament after the later victories of the
Civil War; while the Bristol merchants made a regular
rade of kidnapping labourers, and thus were able to compete
with the Dutch, in whose hands the trade in negroes
then mainly resided. Before the Restoration Barbados had
attained a dense population, great wealth, and prosperity,
though even there the English settlers were the minority,
and the mass of the population were black slaves. Other
English settlements were made in the Bahamas and on the
coast of Guiana, but they were not of much account. The
capture of the great Spanish island of Jamaica in <date value="1655">1655</date>
started a new period of development for the British West
Indies. It was the first island won by conquest as opposed
to settlement.</p><p>

  15. Despite the European settlements, the West Indies were still
a lawless region, and the decline of the Spanish power made the first
three-quarters of the seventeenth century the time of
the prosperity of the Buccaneers. The name Buccancer
<note place="foot" n="31">The Buccaneers of the WestIndies.</note>
 comes from the boucan or wooden grid on
which the sailors and adventurers in wild lands grilled
or dried their meat, and is less specially appropriate to these desperadoes
than that of Filibusters, which is derived from the Dutch flyboats,
or swift-sailing vessels, in which they pursued their trade. The
Buccaneers were men of all nations, English, Dutch, and French,
and were bound together by a love of plunder and a common hatred
of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>. The governments of the three trading states largely
sympathised with them in their hatred of the monopolist and exclusive
policy of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, and some of the best of them retained a touch
of the old crusading spirit of Drake or the "Water-beggars" of
Holland. The extraordinary weakness and imbecility of the Spaniards
gave them their best chance, and for many years the little island
of Tortuga was a cosmopolitan corsair-state that played havoc with
the Spanish settlements. The tale of the buccaneers is a story of
hideous violence, cruelty, and greed, but their desperate bravery and
fierce heroism surrounded these degenerate descendants of the Elizabethan
marauders with a faint halo of romance. Henry Morgan
(<dateRange from="1635" to="1688">1635-1688</dateRange>), the most famous British representative of them, was a
poor Welsh boy from Glamorganshire, kidnapped by the Bristol
merchants and sold as a white slave at Barbados. At the end of his
term of service Morgan joined the buccaneers, and soon became so
famous that they made him their admiral. After many and daring
adventures, he crowned his career in <date value="1671">1671</date> by the capture of Panama,
under circumstances every whit as bold and heroic as those of any
exploit of Drake or Hawkins. Though England and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> were at
peace, the English in Jamaica hailed the slayer of the Spaniards as a





               <pb id="p.325" n="325"/>

hero; and a few years later he lecame a knight and governor of
Jamaica. But Morgan was almost the last of his race. Frightened
by his exploits, <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> recognized the foreign settlers in her midst as
she had never done before. Far from receiving support at home,
later buccaneers fought for their own hands, and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> was free to
hang as many as she could catch. The growing rivalry of England
and<placeName key="France">France</placeName> broke up the honour among thieves that had made the
union of pirates from different lands easy and possible. <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> in her
weakness struck up a friendship with England. The later buccaneers
became mere pirates, the offscourings of humanity, with nothing
heroic or noble to set against their greedy and businesslike pursuit of
plunder and murder. Yet they had done their work in breaking
down the last remnants of Spanish trade, and our greatest West
Indian possession, Jamaica, owes more to the buccaneers than to
Penn and Venables, or to Cromwell himself. The French buccaneers
procured for<placeName key="France">France</placeName> a large share of Hispaniola. All alike were
heralds of free trade, though they proclaimed its principles in characters
of blood and fire.
</p><p>
  16. The period between the Restoration and the Revolution
  marked a great advance of the older colonies and
the establishment of several new ones. The
Navigation Acts secured for English ships
<note place="foot" n="32">  Advance of the older Colonies,between <dateRange from="1660" to="1689">1660and 1689</dateRange></note>
the monopoly of colonial trade, but the first
effect of this was only to deprive the Dutch
of a large share of business, and most of the English
settlers cared so little about navigation that it was indifferent
to them that they were deprived by the Acts of
their best chance of developing a local navy. In <date value="1662">1662</date> a
special Council for Foreign Plantations was set up, after
the model of a similar colonial department established by
Cromwell. The result of such measures was an increased
interference on the part of the mother country that gave
rise to a great deal of friction, despite the fact that
<persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. and his ministers intervened with intelligence
and wisdom, besides protecting the colonies from the
increasing danger of attacks from foreign enemies. This
home supervision specially touched the West Indies and
Virginia. In the former, the abolition of proprietary
government in Barbados (<date value="1663">1663</date>) and the other islands, the
separation in <date value="1671">1671</date> of the Leeward Islands from Barbados
and the Windward Caribbean islands in a separate government,
and an attempt a little later at a systematic plan of
federation, were so many marks of progress. New islands
were now settled, as, for example, the Virgin Islands and
more of the Bahamas. By the Treaty of Breda the English
settlements in Guiana went to the Dutch; but the
gradual settlement of log-cutters in Yucatan, the origin of






<pb id="p.326" n="326"/>

the later British Honduras, showed that England had not
forgotten the mainland. In Virginia the even progress of
the colony was only slightly disturbed by the revolt of
Nathaniel Bacon, who burnt Jamestown to the ground, and
dreamt of a union with Maryland and Carolina, and the
assertion of the independence of the three colonies (<date value="1676">1676</date>).
The increasing suspicion of Papists now caused the withdrawal
of most of the rights of the house of Calvert over
Maryland.</p><p>
   New England was more resentful than the southern
colonies of home control. Yet home influence contributed
to the wise reduction of the number of colonies. Newhaven
was almost forcibly absorbed in Connecticut in <date value="1664">1664</date>;
and Plymouth, which had politically become a mere cypher,
was incorporated with Massachusetts in <date value="1691">1691</date>. On the other
hand jealousy of Massachusetts induced the establishment
of a separate Government in the proprietary colony of
New Hampshire in <date value="1680">1680</date>, though Maine, which the great
Puritan colony had purchased, remained on her hands as
a dependency. After a strong struggle with the colonists,
the Tory reaction at the end of <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.'s reign issued a
writ of quo warranto inquiring by what authority Massachusetts
exercised its franchises; and in <date value="1684">1684</date> her charter
was annulled, and the colony, thus reduced to comparative
dependence, gladly welcomed the Revolution, which restored
it to its former rights. Before the end of the century the exclusive
Puritanism of New England began to break up, and
the churches of Massachusetts gradually relaxed the conditions
of the church membership that still remained the
gate of citizenship. So little scrupulous were the New
Englanders of their ways of getting rich, that they made a
regular business of fitting out pirate craft to prey on the
traders of the distant Indian Ocean.</p><p>
   17. More important than the development of the old
 colonies was the establishment of new ones. The English
<note place="foot" n="33">Conquest of New	York and theNew Jerseys,<date value="1667">1667</date>.	</note>
hold of the eastern coast of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>
could never be regarded as secure, so long
as the Dutch possessions in the Hudson
Valley cut off New England from the Virginian
group by a deep wedge of hostile territory. It
was therefore of great future moment that, during the
Dutch War of <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.'s reign, the New Netherlands
were conquered and that their possession was confirmed
to England by the Peace of Breda (<date value="1667">1667</date>). <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.
granted the conquered district to his brother James; and in






       <pb id="p.327" n="327"/>

honour of the proprietor the land and its capital received
the name of New York; while New Orange, the up-country
trading station on the Hudson, was called New Albany,
after James's second title. James governed New York
as a strict proprietary colony, and it was not until <date value="1682">1682</date>
that he allowed the inhabitants the rights of choosing an
Assembly, after the fashion of the other colonies. James
disposed of the western parts of the New Netherlands to
Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret, from whom they
got the name of New Jersey, since Carteret was a Jersey man.
Before long Berkeley sold his moiety to some Quaker
proprietors, who in <date value="1676">1676</date>
agreed with Carteret to divide the
province, Carteret's share being called New East Jersey,
while the Quakers' property took the name of New West
Jersey. West Jersey was soon largely peopled by the persecuted
" Friends," who laid down absolute religious liberty as
the first principle of its constitution, and resolved that "all
elections be not determined by the common and confused
ways of cries and voices, but by putting balls into ballotingboxes."</p><p>
  18. In <date value="1663">1663</date> a
  charter was given to an influential body ot
proprietors, among whom were Albemarle, Clarendon and
Ashley, to set up a new colony, called after
<note place="foot" n="34">  The Plantation of the Carolinas, <date value="1663">1663</date>.</note>
<persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. Carolina, in the southern lands
between Virginia and the Spanish colony of
Florida.  The district was already partially settled by
emigrants from New England, Virginia and Barbados.
In the swampy forests of the north a scattered and
spiritless population of squatters grew up, whose only
wealth lay in their herds of swine. The northern settlers
gradually drifted apart from the flourishing planters in
the more fertile lands to the south, where Charlestown the
capital was situated. South Carolina was the first colony
to rely from the beginning on the labour of negro slaves,
who could be the more readily imported now that the
Navigation Act transferred the trade from Dutch to English
ships. Its population was riotous and disorderly, and the
absentee proprietors found great difficulty in enforcing
obedience. This became more important when, in <date value="1667">1667</date>,
the famous Whig philosopher John Locke drew up at his
patron Ashley's request an elaborate scheme of government
for Carolina called The Fundamental Constitutions.
</p><p>
This was the strange and fantastic scheme of an abstract theorist,
which, though never fully adopted in the colony, is of much interest







<pb id="p.328" n="328"/>

in the history of political ideas.  The government was to be put in
the hands of a feudal aristocracy, the head of which, chosen from
<note place="foot" n="35">John Locke's Fundamental Constitutions for Carolina, <date value="1667">1667</date>.</note>
among the proprietors, was called the Palatine, under
whom was a body of hereditary nobles, fantastically
styled Landgraves and Caciques. The proprietors were
to form the Palatine's Court, and the Parliament was
to consist of proprietors, nobles and representatives of the freeholders,
all sitting in one assembly. The proprietors held the executive and
judicial power, and each received a sounding title, such as Chancellor,
Admiral, Justice and Treasurer. No citizen of Carolina had full rights
unless he was a member of a church, but any seven persons could
found a church, which enjoyed full religious liberty, if it accepted the
doctrines of the existence of God, the duty of public worship, and the
necessity of oaths. The whole early history of Carolina is the record
of the quarrels between the inhabitants and the proprietors, in the
course of which Locke's Constitutions were gradually dropped.
Later on, the colony was formally divided into North and South
Carolina.</p><p>
   19. Towards the end of <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.'s reign the colony of
Pennsylvania was founded. Its originator, William Penn,
<note place="foot" n="36">William Penn and the settlement of Pennsylvania, <date value="1681">1681</date>.
</note>the famous Quaker, was the son of Admiral
Penn, the conqueror of Jamaica and a man of
good education and high social position, who,
to the amusement of the fashionable world,
became a Quaker in costume, creed and conduct. His
desire to help his persecuted co-religionists led him to
become one of the trustees of West New Jersey, which
through his influence was largely settled by " Friends." The
success of this enterprise led Penn to embark in a wider
scheme of colonisation, in which he followed and developed
the principles already applied in the Jerseys. In <date value="1681">1681</date> he
obtained from the Crown a grant of the country west of
the Delaware, which in honour of his father he called
Pennsylvania. He obtained as proprietor both the executive
and legislative power, subject to the assent of the free
settlers, and in <date value="1682">1682</date>, he drew up a democratic constitution
for his colony.</p><p>
  By this constitution a Provincial Council and a General Assembly,
both elected by ballot, were set up. In the courts of law all cases
were to be tried by jury, and no oaths were imposed.
<note place="foot" n="37">Penn's Constitution for Pennsylvania, <date value="1682">1682</date>.</note>
All who believed in God and accepted the Christian
moral code were allowed to hold religious worship
after their own fashion. Harsh laws were passed by the Assembly
against swearing, intemperance, play-going, card-playing, "and
other evil sports and games."
</p><p>
  In <date value="1682">1682</date> Penn went to America and founded the city of
Philadelphia. Besides the Quakers, many Germans and






                 <pb id="p.329" n="329"/>

Dutch settled in the new colony, which at once began to
flourish. Penn was a well-meaning enthusiast, with much
zeal but no great practical wisdom. His constitution broke
down almost from the beginning by reason of the conflicts
of the Council and the General Assembly, to which latter
body Penn was forced to make over the legislative power.
With all his humanity and piety, he did not scruple to
possess negro slaves, but it is remembered to his honour
that he was the first American legislator who sought to
give legal rights both to them and to the Indians, and it
was a great sorrow to him that the opposition of the slaveholding
General Assembly prevented him from giving
effect to all his desire to improve the condition of the
blacks.</p><p>
  20. In <date value="1670">1670</date>,
  at the instance of Prince Rupert, the Hudson's
Bay Company was set up with a monopoly of trade and
settlement in the regions surrounding Hudson's
<note place="foot" n="38">Rupertsland.</note>
Bay, which were called Rupertsland in
honour of the prince. The operations of this company first
brought England into competition with the trappers and
hunters of the French settlements of Canada.</p><p>
  21. Thus in the course of the seventeenth century England
  made itself a great commercial and colonising power.
Its trading stations in India and Africa, its
<note place="foot" n="39">  The first stage in the Expansionof England and its results.</note>
colonies in <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName> and the West
Indies spread the fame of the English race
all over the world.  Though the English
came late in this field, they had won their way by their
superior strength, energy and ability, and not seldom by
their utter recklessness and unscrupulous greed. They had
outdistanced Portugal and beaten Holland after a severe
contest. Their colonies were more important than those of
any European state save <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, and they were infinitely
superior to the Spaniards in all that makes successful
settlers. They had still to fight out their struggle with
France, but French colonisation and foreign trade were so
little spontaneous that all the energies of Louis XIV. could
do little to give them reality, and when the fight came,
England had acquired so strong a position that her ultimate
success was certain. The Englishmen of the Stewart
period were never more like their modern descendants than
when busily and successfully engaged in spreading our
commerce and our race over distant continents. Despite
the vices of a system that regarded colonies as existing
for the good of the mother country, and the neglect and







<pb id="p.330" n="330"/>

carelessness of a later age that thought little of the New
England beyond the sea, the impulse that began with the
foundation of Virginia and Massachusetts and with the
setting up of the East India Company has done more
than anything else to give the British race the great
position which it now holds.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VIII.
        England in the Seventeenth Century.</head>
<p>
  1. In contrast to the busy turmoil of the religious and
political strife and the strenuous endeavour that won
England a foremost place among the
<note place="foot" n="1">Progress in the Seventeenth Century.</note>            					     mercial nations of Europe and set up a widely
comspreading system  of colonies and dependencies,
the steady development of English society during
the seventeenth century seems tame and uneventful.
There were no longer economic and social revolutions
as in the days of the Tudors. The note of the time is
gradual progress on the lines laid down in the age of
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. Neither the religious nor the political revolutions
of the century had the least effect in checking the
onward march. Even the Great Rebellion did little to
hinder it, for the Puritan revolt was a purely religious and
political movement, having no social aspect, since the
Levellers, the only social reformers, never attained to power
and did not even succeed in touching any strong chords of
sympathy among the people.  The same characteristics
marked the social history of <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, which henceforward
followed much the same lines as its southern neighbour.
Even in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, despite racial and religious hatred and
the deep social changes resulting from the great confiscations,
there was at least more peace and order and a higher
measure of material prosperity in the days of the Restoration,
than when the memories of the Elizabethan and
Cromwellian conquests were still fresh.</p><p>
  2. A prominent characteristic of the time is that expansion
of foreign trade, which we have already traced. The effects
of this on England were numerous and important.
It gave increased weight to commercial
<note place="foot" n="2">Effects of the growth of commerce and colonies at home
</note> questions, enhanced the wealth and
Influence of the trading classes, raised the
general standard of comfort, and profoundly influenced the






       <pb id="p.331" n="331"/>

foreign policy of the English state. It swelled the receipts
of the imperial exchequer, and enabled a larger income
to be levied without inconvenience to the taxpayer. Thus
the English navy, which <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>. had with difficulty set
in a good position with the help of Ship Money, was
strengthened by the Long Parliament, and even the waste
and extravagance of the Restoration did not prevent
it from remaining efficient. An interest in shipping and
colonies became the fashion, when the highest personages
in the land, with the King and the Duke of York
at their head, were conspicuous among the promoters of
the new enterprises. Banking and finance
attained to a new importance. The London
<note place="foot" n="3">Banking and finance</note>.
goldsmiths, who kept persons' cash for them, and lent it out on
interest to the state or to private individuals, became wealthy
and influential. Men began to give serious thought to the
theory of trade, and to those questions concerning the production
and distribution of wealth which are called economic.
There was a curious tendency to confuse wealth and money,
which led to the export of specie being strictly forbidden.
India merchants, who were forced to buy their wares in the
East with silver, found that they had to contend with this
general prejudice against sending money out of the country,
by arguing that though they might export silver to begin
with, yet they more than got it back again by their sales of
eastern produce to foreigners.  From  this
starting-point grew up the doctrine of the Mercantile
<note place="foot" n="4"> The Mercantile system and the Balance of Trade.</note>
 System, that the advantage of foreign
trade depends upon the amount of gold and silver which it
brings into a country. If a trade thus brought in bullion,
the Balance of Trade was said to be in our favour, but if it
necessitated sending gold and silver away, then the balance
was said to be against us. It was, therefore, a matter of
supreme concern to make the exports exceed the imports,
and the growth of exports involved the increase of manufactures
and agriculture.</p><p>
  3. Manufactures steadily became more numerous and
important, though there were no great revolutions in methods,
and, despite all the efforts of the state to stimulate
new crafts, England remained, till far
<note place="foot" n="5">Manufactures</note>
beyond the end of the century, a commercial and agricultural
rather than a manufacturing country, and depended
on<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, Holland, and the East for the finer wares that
were beyond the limited appliances and skill of English
makers. Nevertheless after the Restoration the example






<pb id="p.332" n="332"/>

of Holland was largely followed, in this as in many other
sides of our life, and manufacturing industry received a
considerable stimulus. It was especially helped forward
by the great Huguenot emigration resulting from the
persecutions of Louis XIV., which brought to England a
large population of skilled mechanics and small craftsmen,
who introduced many new processes and gave the industries
of our country an impetus that has never since slackened.
Meanwhile the ancient staple manufacture of woollen
cloth prospered increasingly, being so carefully fostered
by the state, that an act of <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. even ordered
that no bodies should be buried, save in a woollen shroud.
<note place="foot" n="6">Mining </note>
From the early days of the Stewarts, British
mines were opened up.   The salt industry
began to enrich Cheshire. The Tyneside colliers grew prosperous
by providing London with "sea-coal" for fuel,
and the Cornish tin mines and Welsh lead mines were
developed on a larger scale. Agriculture greatly flourished,
though all through the century there were
<note place="foot" n="7"> Agriculture </note>
spells of good and bad seasons that made
the farmers' trade somewhat exceptionally speculative and
uncertain. There was still much untilled soil, and a large
proportion of the ploughed land was common field, cultivated
in an extravagant and careless way after old-fashioned
methods. Many enclosures of this open space were made,
though enclosing was no longer effected for the sake of
sheep-farming, but rather for the encouragement of better
methods of tillage, and preserving the young crops by
tall hedgerows from nipping winds or trespassing cattle.
Rents rose and made the landed gentry more prosperous.
Though some of the countrysquires were rustic and clownish,
the class that produced all the great political leaders of the
century was wanting neither in intelligence, education, nor
ability. The increased rent-rolls of the landlords did not
prevent farmers from thriving as well. One result of the
demand for more land was the success of great schemes
for draining the Fen country. For the first time since the
<note place="foot" n="8">Vermuyden and the drainage of the Fens.</note>
Reformation, the draining work of the great
abbeys was taken up by the landlords who had
supplanted them, and especially by the Earl
of Bedford. At this nobleman's instance a Dutch engineer
named Cornelius Vermuyden, who had come to England in
<date value="1621">1621</date>, undertook the great work which turned BedfordLevel,
in the north of Cambridgeshire, from its old condition of
an unhealthy and scantily peopled desert into the best corn




   <pb id="p.333" n="333"/>

land of the country.  <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>. encouraged the enterprise
and made Vermuyden a knight, but the work was
much interrupted by the Great Rebellion and the hostility
of the fenmen to Vermuyden and his foreigners. It was at
last completed in <date value="1652">1652</date>,
still under his direction.  Vermuyden also drained
Hatfield Chase, on the borders of
Lincolnshire and <placeName key="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</placeName> by diverting the waters of the
Don.   The new straight "cuts" dug by the engineers
served also for navigation, and all over the country efforts
were made, though as yet they were but feeble ones, to
make rivers more easily navigable and thus to improve
internal communications.</p><p>
  4. The peasantry shared in the increasing prosperity.
Wages rose as well as rents and prices, and the attempts,
started in Tudor times, to leave the Justices of
<note place="foot" n="9">The poor and pauperism.</note>
the Peace to settle the rate of wages were
practically a dead letter, for employers who wanted a man's
work were willing to pay him what he asked and what they
knew they could afford, even if the magistrates persisted
in fixing on a lower rate of remuneration. The increase in
the habit of tippling, and the efforts to check it by regulating
alehouses, show at least that labourers had money
to spend on what was not a matter of necessity,
Pauperism, so terrible a trouble under the Tudors, distinctly
became less burdensome under the Stewarts. Yet
it still remained a real evil, and the unequal distribution of
the poor made their relief very burdensome in certain unlucky districts,
especially as vagrants gladly settled in places
where there were large commons, abundance of wood, and
other attractions to them, so that some spots became
pauperised because of their wealth. In the hope of remedying
this state of things, the Restoration Parliament passed
the Act of Settlement of <date value="1662">1662</date>,
the chief law of the period
affecting the condition of the poor. By it each
parish was allowed to remove to the place,
where he had previously had a legal settlement,
<note place="foot" n="10">The Act of Settlement, <date value="1662">1662</date>.
</note>a newcomer within forty days of his arrival, if there
were any likelihood of his becoming chargeable to the
parish. By thus throwing the obligation of supporting the
poor on the parishes in which they were born or had long
resided, a great blow was given to vagrancy, but in future
times the check in the free movement of labour from place
to place tied the artisan, like a slave, to the spot of his
birth and prevented him from going to the district where
his services were most wanted.</p><p>






<pb id="p.334" n="334"/>

  5. Population grew, though not very rapidly. Towards
the end of the century it was estimated that England and
 <placeName key="Wales">Wales</placeName> contained about five million inhabitants.
 <note place="foot" n="11">Populatlon.</note>
 The north was still poor and scantily
peopled, and the increase of population and wealth was
mainly in the south and east. The growth of commerce
<note place="foot" n="12">
Growth of Towns </note>
enriched and enlarged the seaport towns, and
 especially London, which was then the only
really great town in the whole of England. While Bristol
and Norwich, the next towns in size, had not more than
30,000 inhabitants each, half a million were collected in
   <note place="foot" n="13">London</note>
and about the capital. This inequality made
London an even greater influence on politics,
fashion, and opinion than it is nowadays. The hostility of
London to <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>. had supplied his opponents with
revenue and resources, and had been a very large factor in
bringing about his fall. Though the purse and brains of the
City were powerless to resist the military rule of Cromwell
and his army, London gladly threw off their yoke, and did
even more to bring about the Restoration than it had done
to promote the Great Rebellion, while twenty years later its
support of Shaftesbury almost cost <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. his throne.
London was even more important as an intellectual than as
a political centre. Nearly all the ablest men lived in or near
it; all the printing of the nation that was not done at the
universities was done there. This strong influence of the
capital may have had something to do with the hostility
with which Tudors and Stewarts alike looked upon the
continued growth of its population, though the ineffectual
measures taken to prevent the extension of its suburbs had
the full support of the City authorities, and were mainly due
to the difficulty which the age saw in governing, feeding,
and keeping healthy so vast a mass of human beings. The
City wished to extend its boundaries so that all the inhabited
ground should be divided between it and the city of
<placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, but this wise proposal came to nothing, and
great ungoverned disorderly towns arose side by side with,
yet having no part in, the capital. Their only advantages
were that they were less overcrowded than the narrow area
of the City, and less subject to the antiquated and oppressive
rules of the City Companies, which restrained rather than
encouraged the trades that they were meant to protect.
The sanitary condition of City and suburbs alike was
deplorable. The water supply drawn from the Thames
was unhealthy and insufficient, though an improvement set





    <pb id="p.335" n="335"/>

in when under <persName key="James I">James I</persName>. the New River Company brought
a wholesome supply of running water from the streams
of Hertfordshire. The wooden, closely-packed houses
were in constant danger of fire, and plague was seldom
long absent. It was hard to supply so great a mass of
people with food; and the scarcity and dearness of wood
for fuel was another real evil, until the Londoners unwillingly
took to burning coal, which numerous small
trading ships brought from Newcastle to their doors. The
streets were dirty, ill-paved and badly lighted. The character
of the roads made the river the easiest way of getting
from one end of the town to the other, though nervous
people were afraid to shoot the rapids, caused by the many
arches of London Bridge. The police was extremely ineffective.
Robbery was very common, and after dark bands
of gentlemen amused themselves by assaulting and insulting
passers-by. This nuisance became greater in the riotous
days after the Restoration, and gave occasion to the
famous lines in which Milton tells how,</p><p>
      <quote rend="blockquote"> "In luxurious cities, when the noise
         Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers,
         And injury and outrage: and when night
         Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons
         Of Belial, flushed with insolence and wine."</quote></p><p>
   London extended itself on all sides. The court suburbs
steadily grew in the west. In <persName key="James I">James I</persName>.'s time Inigo Jones
laid out Lincoln's Inn Fields, then a very fashionable centre,
and built his famous new church of St. Paul's Covent
Garden. After the Restoration population flowed farther
westwards, where the new parish of St. James' was filled
with solid, sumptuous, and handsome houses. Poorer districts
arose to the north and east of the city. Moorfields
was built over after the Great Fire, and Spitalfields and
Whitechapel became manufacturing centres, while Shadwell
and Wapping throve by reason of the growth of the
shipping trade.  After the Great Fire in the City, brick
replaced wood as a building material, and the streets were
made broader and straighter; but the proposal of<persName key="Wren, Sir Christopher">Wren</persName> for
rebuilding the town, on a more magnificent scale and an
entirely new plan, was not carried out.</p><p>
   6. With all its drawbacks, life in London had plenty of
 attractions. Until <date value="1642">1642</date>
 the playhouses were in full swing,
 but they were closed by order of Parliament
 <note place="foot" n="14">    Amusements.</note>
 before the beginning of the Civil War, and
 were not opened until the Restoration.  The Puritans






<pb id="p.336" n="336"/>

had long waged war against the drama, and its extravagances
and corruptions gave them plenty of good arguments.
They also condemned other favourite sports, such as cockfighting
and bull- and bear-baiting, while sword and buckler
play and many other recreations dropped out of use, since
the Puritan rule prevented their being practised on Sunday,
the only day that working people now had free. It was
made a merit that the Puritan ordinance prohibiting work
or sports on Sunday "shall not extend to prohibit dressing
meat in private families." Yet all the austerity of Puritan
rule did not prevent "many hundreds of rich coaches and
gallants in attire, but most shameful powdered-hair men and
painted and spotted women" frequenting Hyde Park, where
the Lord Protector himself witnessed a hurling match, and
was once overthrown from his coach, when he was driving
six young horses. The exclusion of the majority of the
younger gentry from public life during the Commonwealth
had the bad effect of giving them nothing to do except to
amuse themselves. Even before the Restoration the habit
of making pleasure and frivolity the end of life had begun
among the wealthier classes. In the mad reaction against
Puritanism that followed the bringing back of the king,
the pursuit of pleasure reigned for a time supreme.</p><p>
  The playhouses were re-opened, though the fashion for
attending the theatre had so far dwindled that two small
theatres, the Duke's and the King's, supplied
<note place="foot" n="15">The Playhouses</note>
the wants of those who frequented the drama
in the days of the Restoration. Spectacular effects, that
had never been employed in earlier times, save in the
elaborate Masques that amused the court of <persName key="James I">James I</persName>. and
<persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>., were now introduced into the public theatres.
Pepys tells us how the stage was now "a thousand times
better and more glorious than heretofore," with fine scenery,
brilliant dresses, and a stage blazing with wax candles,
"where formerly there were not above three pounds of
tallow." Women now for the first time acted in the female
parts, and ballet dancing, brought in from<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, became
popular.</p><p>
  Gentlemen exercised themselves at the manage, or riding
school, and with fencing, tennis, and a game at ball called
<note place="foot" n="16">Games and sports. </note>
pall-mall, while they amused themselves with
the fashionable sports of cock-fighting and
horse-racing. When <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. went for racing to Newmarket,
he saw a cock-fight after dinner and a play in the
evening, acted in a barn by low-class travelling comedians.






        <pb id="p.337" n="337"/>

It was a sign of the progress of refinement that the old
national amusements of bull- and bear-baiting were no
longer approved of in polite circles, though still extremely
popular with the people. The bear-gardens were now also
used for boxing and prize-fights with swords, in which some
humane people complained of the horrible wounds the
combatants inflicted on each other, though more perhaps
grumbled that the fighters did not hit hard enough to show
that they were in real earnest. The old London pleasure-grounds
had been closed by the Puritans, but
Vauxhall or the New Spring Garden was
<note place="foot" n="17">The Parks and Gardens.</note>
opened in <date value="1660">1660</date>, and <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.
admitted the public to
St. James's Park whither multitudes flocked to watch the
king or the duke taking their exercise, feeding the ducks
in the pond, or playing pall-mall, as Waller's poem commemorates:
<quote rend="blockquote">        "Here a well-polished mall gives us the joy
        To see our prince his matchless force employ
        No sooner has he touched the flying ball,
        But 'tis already more than half the mall."</quote>
For indoor resorts men of fashion now went, after the
early dinner of the period, to the Coffee houses, which served
the purposes of modern clubs, and were
centres of gossip   and society.   Politics,
<note place="foot" n="18">The Coffeehouses.</note>
theology, literature, and fashion were so freely discussed
that lovers of old ways, like Clarendon, thought them
seminaries of sedition, and wished to see them carefully
watched. In <date value="1675">1675</date> <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.
shut them up, and only
allowed them to be re-opened on the landlords promising
to prevent abuse of the Government.
  Coffee was first drunk in <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.'s time, but before
that chocolate had come in, and was vaunted by its
sellers as a specific against all sorts of diseases.
Tea was introduced rather later by
<note place="foot" n="19">coffee, Tea, and Chocolate.</note>
the Portuguese, and made popular by Catharine of Braganza. As Waller sang:
     <quote rend="blockquote"> "Venus her myrtle, Phoebus has his bays;
        Tea both excels, which she vouchsafes to praise.
        The best of queens and best of herbs we owe
        To that bold nation which the way did show
        To the fair region where the sun does rise,
        Whose rich productions we so justly prize."</quote>
All these beverages had a great effect in changing social
habits and making life more refined; but drunkenness was
still too common in all classes of society.  Gambling







<pb id="p.338" n="338"/>

became a wide-spread vice after <date value="1660">1660</date>.  <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. was
celebrated for bringing in a "politer way of living," but
foreigners complained of the grossness of English repasts,
and the rareness of forks. Men continued to wear their hats
at feasts. There were still only two meals a day. Dinner
was at one o'clock, and few took anything earlier but a
"morning draught" of beer, with some bread and butter.</p><p>
   7. Despite the badness of communications, men flocked
to London, and the Londoners began the habit of spending
<note place="foot" n="20">Communications.</note>
the summer at inland watering-places such as
Bath or Tunbridge Wells, which latter became
so much frequented by invalids that, after the Restoration,
a church was built for their use, dedicated to Charles the
Martyr. The poorer Londoners "took the waters" at
Epsom, while Harrogate and Buxton stood in the same
place to the northern gentry. Coaches, which under <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>
were a rare luxury, became common. Lumbering
family carriages, drawn by six horses, slowly dragged the
nobles and gentry from place to place over the miry roads,
though active people, who wanted to travel fast, still rode
on horseback. Carriers' waggons began to replace strings
of packhorses for transporting goods, where water carriage
was not available and the roads were good enough for
wheeled traffic. They also afforded a slow but cheap way
of travelling for poorer wayfarers unable to walk or ride.
The first toll-bars were set up in <date value="1663">1663</date> on the Great North
Road, and the money taken was used to mend the highway.
Stage coaches began with the Commonwealth, though they
were denounced as fatal to simplicity and the breed of horses.
Under <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. flying coaches, as they were called,
managed to travel more than fifty miles a day, getting, for
example, from London to Oxford in twelve hours. Hackney
coaches, plying for hire, began in London under the Commonwealth,
and did something to divert traffic from the
Thames. Glass coaches, i.e. coaches with glass windows,
were luxuries used by fashionable people for taking the air.
The labourers, who mended the roads, expected a gratuity
from travellers, and it was quite customary to take a guide
even for journeys along the highways. Under the Commonwealth
a government postal system was set
<note place="foot" n="21">The Postal System.</note>
up, which the Restoration adopted and improved,
twopence being charged for sending a letter eighty
miles from London, and threepence for any part of England
beyond that distance. The Postmaster-General had
a monopoly of post horses, and the mails travelled one






      <pb id="p.339" n="339"/>

hundred and twenty miles a day. A penny post, started in
London by private enterprise, was taken over by the
Government. Mail packets plied with tolerable regularity
to the chief ports of the Continent.</p><p>
  8. Dress underwent a complete revolution during the
century. The dignified and appropriate costume for gentlemen,
which is remembered from Vandyck's
<note place="foot" n="22"> Dress.</note>
portraits, became more fantastic and extravagant
towards the middle of the century, and afforded
reasonable grounds for Puritan attack. A great simplification
of costume resulted for a time from Puritan influence,
though it is an exaggeration to suppose that the politics of
a gentleman during the Civil War could at once be discerned
by the cut and colour of his clothes. The ribands,
frills, tags and points of the "debauched Cavalier" were
avoided by all grave persons, whatever their views, and the
Puritan wide-brimmed steeple-crowned hat, long doublet,
and heavy boots, were an exaggeration of the dress of
a citizen rather than a special device of the precisians.
Even the Anabaptist Harrison, who thought that " worldly
bravery did not become saints," did not scruple to wear at
a public audience "a scarlet coat and cloak, both laden
with gold and silver lace, and the coat so covered with foil
that one scarcely could discern the ground." The household
of Cromwell, which gradually assumed the appearance
of a court, was that of a plain but perfectly well-bred
gentleman.  His entertainments and equipages were
sumptuous, and, though he ordinarily wore a simple black
coat and cloak, he put on a " musk-colour suit, richly embroidered
with gold," when he went to dine with the Lord
Mayor. His sons' dress gave great offence to the stricter
sort. Swords almost ceased to be carried for a time, but
they came back again before the Restoration.</p>
<p>Under <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. the doublet and long cloak ceased to
be worn, and in their place men dressed in the garments
which ultimately became the modern coat and waistcoat,
and in tight knee-breeches. Low shoes superseded boots,
and the lace band was replaced by a lace cravat. Early in
the reign wigs came in, and before long the example of
Louis XIV. made large dark-coloured wigs the fashion.
After the introduction of the periwig, faces began to be
clean shaven, though in an earlier generation even bishops
like Laud had worn moustaches and pointed beard. Men
often carried muffs, fastened round their necks by a ribbon.</p>
<p>Ladies' dress underwent corresponding changes. Despite







<pb id="p.340" n="340"/>

Catharine of Braganza's love of short gowns, trains came
into general wear, while hoods or cocked hats and feathers
were not unusual. The beauties of <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.'s court wore
their hair clustering in curls, and low dresses. Wigs became
fashionable even for ladies, who also wore "puffs" or false
curls, extended on wires that made their heads look very
wide. Patches also came into common use.
 </p><p> 9. In fashionable circles education became more and
more the learning of good and graceful manners. The
 <note place="foot" n="23">Education </note>
 accomplished gallants and the learned ladies
 of the Elizabethan age both became almost
extinct. Gentlemen of fashion were content with a superficial
smattering of elegant French culture, and the average lady
of quality could neither spell nor express herself correctly.
"Let not your girl learne Latin nor shorthand," wrote a
Buckinghamshire squire and member of the Long Parliament,
" the difficulty of the first may keep her from that vice,
for so I must esteem it in a woman, but the easiness of the
other may be a prejudice to her, for the pride of taking
sermon notes hath made multitudes of women most unfortunate
." During the Commonwealth it became usual to
bring up young gentlemen at home, to avoid the Puritanised
schools and universities ; but the results were not encouraging.
After the Restoration boys were sent to Eton, because
the provost "was not only a fine gentleman himself, but
very skilled in the art of making others so." A more solid
training was given at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> School during the long
headmastership of Dr. Busby. Travel was encouraged to
give young men knowledge of the world, while girls learned
French, "now almost as fashionable among women of
quality as men," at suburban boarding-schools. The
universities saw strange vicissitudes during the
 <note place="foot" n="24"> The Univerities</note>
 century. Whitgift had broken down the extreme
 Puritanism of Cambridge, and Laud, as chancellor,
did the same for Oxford, where he issued a new code of
university statutes that perhaps improved discipline, but did
harm in the long run, by handing over the government of
the university to a close oligarchy of heads of houses.
Under the Commonwealth the universities were reformed
on Puritan lines, but the ejection of many men of learning
brought about evil results, despite the high character of the
Puritan scholars who replaced them. Under <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.
Oxford was famous for holding extreme ideas about the
Divine right of kings, and both universities strongly supported
the king and the Church. Oxford and Cambridge







    <pb id="p.341" n="341"/>

were now very flourishing. Besides excelling in the traditional
studies, they became centres of the strict investigation
of nature, which was a marked feature of the time.
 </p><p> 10. The revolt of the sixteenth century against the
Middle Ages had led to an utter contempt for its theories
of natural science, though alchemy was still a
<note place="foot" n="25">Natural Science</note>
favourite art and astrology had many votaries.
The Novum Organum (<date value="1620">1620</date>)
of Francis Bacon, though
of little influence on scientific workers, expressed with
emphasis and brilliancy the high expectations which gifted
minds had formed of the fruitful results to be obtained from
the direct interrogation of nature by experimental methods.
Two famous scientific discoveries in the earlier part of the
century were due to subjects of the Stewart Kings. The
Scots laird Napier of Merchiston discovered and elaborated
his system of logarithms, and William Harvey, <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>.'s
physician, demonstrated the circulation of the blood. About
the middle of the century the diffused interest in experimental
science led to the periodic meeting together of a few eminent
Oxford men engaged in its pursuit. The society, nicknamed
at first the Invisible College, sometimes assembled
at Oxford and sometimes at London, until after the Restoration,
when it settled down finally in London, and included
<persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>., who was much interested in natural science,
among its members.   In <date value="1662">1662</date>
<persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName> incorporated the
body under the name of the Royal Society.
Among its founders was Robert Boyle, and an
<note place="foot" n="26">Foundation of the Royal society, <date value="1662">1662</date>.</note>
early member was Isaac Newton
(<dateRange from="1642" to="1727">1642-1727</dateRange>),
Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, whose
famous mathematical and physical discoveries raised him
to an unique position among English men of science. It
was, however, not only by laying the foundations of modern
natural science that the age of the Restoration is memorable.
Experimental investigation became popular and
fashionable, and produced a questioning habit of mind;
equally alien to the sublime self-confidence of the age of
<persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> and to the extreme Puritan tendency of regarding
nature with irdifference as an obstacle to spiritual
perfection.</p><p>
   11. The steady progress of science stands in strong
contrast to the necessary fluctuations in art.  Architecture,
as in the Tudor period, continued to be in
<note place="foot" n="27">  Architecture</note>
a flourishing condition. The great country
houses of <persName key="James I">James I</persName>.'s reign are not readily distinguishable
from those of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s: but two new impulses came in







<pb id="p.342" n="342"/>

early in the century, one of them due to religious reaction,
and the other to the influence of the classical Italian school.
Gothic architecture, which had still lingered in remote
corners, was revived, notably at Oxford, as a result of the
Laudian movement, though the results of this revival were
not very important, and were perhaps curtailed by the
Civil War and Puritan ascendency cutting short for a time
all schemes of church building. More immediately memorable
was the other new tendency that sprang from the
influence of the classical Italian Palladio (d. <date value="1580">1580</date>). Inspired
by this, the clever Welsh architect Inigo Jones (<dateRange from="1573" to="1652">1573-1652</dateRange>),
<note place="foot" n="28"> Inigo Jones </note>
surveyor-general to <persName key="James I">James I</persName>., strove to reproduce
in England the sumptuous but cold correctness
of the Palladian palaces and churches in Vicenza and Venice,
erected in accordance with the strict rules of the ancient
architect Vitruvius. About <date value="1621">1621</date> Jones drew up a scheme
for a magnificent new palace at Whitehall, but the financial
embarrassments of <persName key="James I">James I</persName>. and <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>. prevented
more than a fragment of it from being carried out, though
a specimen still remains in the stately Banqueting House,
before which <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>. was executed. Jones's chief church
was St. Paul's Covent Garden, a building erected for the
wants of the new fashionable quarter, and the first church
of any importance built in England after the Reformation.
He also constructed a classical portico to the Gothic
cathedral of St. Paul's, which perished with the church
itself in the Great Fire of London.</p><p>
  When Inigo Jones died, <persName key="Wren, Sir Christopher">Christopher Wren</persName> (<dateRange from="1632" to="1723">1632-1723</dateRange>),
"that miracle of a youth," had won a great reputation at
<note place="foot" n="29"><persName key="Wren, Sir Christopher">Sir Christopher Wren</persName>.</note>
Oxford for his varied gifts. After the Restoration
he was made <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.'s surveyor-general,
and devoted his fine talents to architecture. His
first important building was the Sheldonian Theatre at Oxford.
The Great Fire gave him a unique opportunity. Though his
brilliant scheme for recasting the whole City was rejected,
New St. Paul's and a crowd of noble parish churches has
immortalised his name. His eye for graceful proportion
made the interior of many of his small City churches
beautiful works of art, conspicuous among them being
St. Stephen's, Walbrook.  The pressure of surrounding
buildings made it necessary to leave many exterior walls
bare, but the spires of St. Mary le Bow and St. Bride's
Fleet Street show what<persName key="Wren, Sir Christopher">Wren</persName> could do in another direction.
His best work is all in the style of the Renascence. His
failure on the few occasions when he attempted the






       <pb id="p.343" n="343"/>

despised Gothic style shows how dead was the art of
the Middle Ages. Domestic architecture found its best
models in the brick-built houses of Holland. At the end
of the century the fashion in all domestic arts was largely
Dutch.</p><p>
  12. There was more taste for painting and sculpture
in England under the Stewarts than under the Tudors.
After <date value="1615">1615</date>, Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel,
formed the first large collection of works of
<note place="foot" n="30">Painting and Sculpture.</note>
art that ever existed in this country, a collection which included
the famous Arundel marbles. <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>. was also a
patron of art, and, despite his scanty means, made a fine
collection of pictures.  Unluckily, no Englishman made
any great name for himself as a painter or sculptor.
A long series of distinguished foreign artists took up
their residence in England, and painted there many of
their best works. The vigorous and magnificent Flemish
colourist, Peter Paul Rubens, was invited to England by
<persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>., who dubbed him knight. Rubens's stay here
was short, but Charles's patronage attracted to England
Rubens's ablest pupil, Antonio Van Dyck, who also was
knighted by the king, and appointed "king's painter."  He
lived in England till his death in <date value="1641">1641</date>, immortalising with
his brush his royal patron, and painting with consummate
delicacy and strength the fair ladies and stately gentlemen
of the time. Puritan intolerance wrought havoc with all
forms of art. <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>.'s pictures were sold and dispersed,
though the sound taste of Cromwell saved some of the
most precious of the king's collection for the country.
Through his care Mantegna's Triumphs of Ceasar still
decorated the long gallery at Hampton Court, and Raphael's
Cartoons were preserved to the nation, while to the scandal
of the precisians, the Protector's bed-chamber was hung
with tapestry representing the history of Mars and Venus.
Peter Lely, a shrewd, workman-like Dutchman, came to
England during the Civil War, and for forty years did an
excellent business in painting all manner of men and
women, from the Lord Protector to the Duchess of Portsmouth
and Nell Gwyn. A large number of foreign artists,
mainly Dutch and Flemish, flourished at <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>.'s
court. Very important was the work of the incomparable
Dutch wood-carver, Grinling Gibbons, whose tasteful and
delicate work appropriately adorned the interior of many
of<persName key="Wren, Sir Christopher">Wren</persName>'s churches.</p>
<p>No art received so heavy a blow from Puritan ascendency






<pb id="p.344" n="344"/>
as that of music, by reason of the hostility of the Puritans
to the dignified worship of the cathedrals, whose choirs
<note place="foot" n="31">Music.</note>
had always been the best schools of English
vocal art. Here, again, Cromwell, who loved
music, exercised an influence for good. Under the Restoration,
the cathedral schools revived, and produced the
greatest English composer in Henry Purcell. Besides his
church music, Purcell was the first Englishman to write a
noteworthy opera, a form of art which was introduced into
England under the Commonwealth and <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>., and
did something by its combination of music and poetry to
compensate for the decay of the masque.</p><p>
13. The revolution in taste and feeling which the Stewart
period witnessed is strikingly illustrated in its literature.
<note place="foot" n="32">The later Elizabethan Dramatists
</note>Under <persName key="James I">James I</persName>., who was a much more active
friend of the drama than ever <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> had
been, we are still in the Elizabethan age.
The first eight years of the king's reign witnessed the
production of the most sublime of<persName key="Shakespeare, William">Shakespeare</persName>'s dramas,
including the great tragedies Othello, Macbeth, Lear, Cymbeline,
the most pregnant of his comedies, the Tempest, A
Winter's Tale, and the most profound of his Roman plays,
Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus. About
<date value="1611">1611</date><persName key="Shakespeare, William">Shakespeare</persName>
sold his shares in his theatres and retired for good
to Stratford, where he died in <date value="1616">1616</date>.
Seven years after
his death, the First Folio, the earliest collected edition of
his works, was published by his friends and brother-actors,
who were anxious to "keep the memory of so worthy a
friend and fellow alive as was our<persName key="Shakespeare, William">Shakespeare</persName>" The great
poet's place was now in some measure taken by his friend
Ben Jonson (<dateRange from="1573" to="1637">1573-1637</dateRange>),
a rough, strong, and learned playwright, and an admirable critic, whose first comedy, Every
Man in his Humour, had been acted in
<date value="1598">1598</date>. As he grew
old, Jonson became the oracle of the chief literary society
of the time, maintaining cordial friendships with his fellowdramatists,
especially with the scholarly Chapman and the
witty Fletcher, and gathering round him men of learning like
the lawyer, antiquary and politician, John Selden, and young
men like Edward Hyde, who handed on the tradition of his
conversational gifts to the age of the Restoration. After
him the chief dramatists of James's reign were<persName key="Shakespeare, William">Shakespeare</persName>'s
admirer Francis Beaumont (d. <date value="1616">1616</date>),
and John Fletcher
(d. <date value="1625">1625</date>), who wrote many plays
in partnership, and John
Webster, a man of mighty tragic genius. Under <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>.
flourished Philip Massinger (d. <date value="1640">
1640</date>), whose consummate



   <pb id="p.345" n="345"/>
stagecraft and nervous diction do something to redeem his
conventionality and coarseness, and John Ford (d. after
<date value="1639">1639</date>), a great master of
deep tragedy, who shrank from
no horrors nor repulsiveness. The character of the drama
changed slowly but surely, becoming more fantastic and
extravagant, and, as the Puritan cry against the stage rose
louder, more reckless and profligate. Yet good plays were
still written up to the closing of the theatres in
<date value="1642">1642</date>, and
the last of the "Elizabethan" dramatists, James Shirley
(d. <date value="1666">1666</date>), lived on until
the Restoration saw the
play-houses again opened, while Sir William
<note place="foot" n="33">The transition to the later drama.</note>
Davenant, who produced operas during the
Protectorate, formed a bridge between the Elizabethans
and the dramatists of the Restoration. The Restoration
stage by no means filled the same part in the life of the
time as that of the Elizabethan age, though the plays
of the great period were still acted and admired, and the
foremost man who now wrote for the stage,
John Dryden (<dateRange from="1631" to="1700">
1631-1700</dateRange>), based the style of
<note place="foot" n="34"> Dryden and the Restoration Dramatists.</note>
his later plays on the Elizabethans. However,
in his earlier pieces Dryden had imitated the classical French
school and had adopted the heroic riming couplet as his
dramatic metre. The drama now became limited to bombastic
and empty "heroic" tragedy, and to bright and
sprightly but gross comedies of manners, though it is only
fair to the much abused "age of the Restoration" to say
that, save William Wycherley, who began to write
in <date value="1672">1672</date>,
most of the so-called " Restoration dramatists " did not pen
a line until nearly a generation had passed over since
<persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>. went back to his throne. The famous attack
of Jeremy Collier on the profligacy of the stage was written
under <persName key="William III">William III</persName>. in <date value="1698">1698</date>.
But the artificial comedians,
with all their wit and dexterity, were but poor substitutes
for the Elizabethans.
14. The poets of the early Stewarts worthily continued
Elizabethan tradition.  A whole school of followers of
Spenser flourished, while the far-fetched and
over-wrought "metaphysical" school, whose
<note place="foot" n="35">Poetry</note>.
best work was written by Donne, represented the opposite
pole of art. A remarkable aftergrowth of the Elizabethan
spirit was to be seen in the delicate school of lyric poets
that flourished in the middle of the century, of whom the
most charming representative was Robert Herrick. The
quaint piety of The Temple of " holy George Herbert" and
the more exalted poetry of Henry Vaughan " the Silurist"


<pb id="p.346" n="346"/>
represent a school of religious poets who owed their being
to the Laudian revival.</p><p>
A deeper and more individual note in poetry was struck
in the early verse of John Milton (<dateRange from="1608" to="1674">1608-1674</dateRange>), a London
<note place="foot" n="36">John Milton.</note>
scrivener's son, who studied deeply at Cambridge,
and becoming " church ousted by the
prelates," settled down at his father's house at Horton in
Buckinghamshire, and produced between <dateRange from="1629"
to="1637">1629 and 1637</dateRange>,
his sweet, musical, and strong early poetry, which in itself
would entitle him to a foremost place in our literature.
He was called away from poetry by his travels, and, on
his return, plunged with acrimony and enthusiasm into the
theological and political disputes of the Civil War period,
and was rewarded for his services to the Independent
cause by his appointment as Latin Secretary to the Council
of State, set up after <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>.'s death, an office which he
continued to hold until the Restoration sent him into a
retirement that was made more irksome by blindness and
domestic troubles. For more than twenty years he had
written no poetry save a few masterly sonnets. He now
attained his loftiest heights in the epics of Paradise
Lost and Paradise Regained, and the classic tragedy of
Samson Agonistes, which wedded the severest and sternest
spirit of Puritanism to the most exquisite and scholarly
music. Milton's high-souled but somewhat impracticable
character kept him aloof from the temper of the age, even
in the days of his pamphlet-writing and political work. He
was doubly lonely, when amidst the riot of the Restoration,
he indited the highest literary expressions of the Puritan
ideal, in an age that was seeking to crush out Puritanism
altogether. Yet sound critics like Dryden at once recognised,
in almost exaggerated terms, the unique greatness
of the Puritan epic, and even to careless foreigners, who
loathed his politics and religion, Milton's solitary figure
represented all that was most characteristic of English
literature</p><p>.
Milton's profound devotion to classical form, his refined
verse, scholarly, severe methods, and Italian culture were
<note place="foot" n="37">The poetry of the Restoration.
</note>peculiar to himself. The new generation of
poets, whose work was largely influenced by
the dominant classic school of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, began with Edmund
Waller, who made popular the heroic couplet as the best
English equivalent to the French Alexandrine. This school
attained its noblest and most sonorous utterances in the
didactic, critical, political, and lyric poems of Dryden, who



     <pb id="p.347" n="347"/>
stands as literary dictator and oracle to the end of the
century in much the same position as Ben Jonson had
attained in the previous age.  The fierce
bursts of irregular and uncontrolled passion of
<note place="foot" n="38">Dryden and his School.</note>
the Elizabethan were trammelled by few of the conventions
which regulated without marring the stately measures of
Dryden, though they exercised a less excellent effect
on smaller men. The spontaneous poetry of emotion is
now succeeded by the studied poetry of the intelligence,
and it is characteristic that Dryden's most famous verses,
Absalom and Achitophel and The Hind and the Panther,
should deal with such subjects as the Popish Plot, and the
religious controversies excited by <persName key="James II">James II</persName>.'s attempt to
win back England to Rome. It is equally characteristic
that one of the most vigorous, popular, and
<note place="foot" n="39"> Butler's Hudibras.</note>
individual of the verse writers of the Restoration,
Samuel Butler (<dateRange from="1612"
to="1680">1612-1680</dateRange>), turned his rare gifts for
biting satire to laughing away the memory of the Puritan
warriors by a mock-heroic account of a ridiculous country
knight called Hudibras. While all the wits and courtiers
read Hudibras and neglected its author, John Bunyan,
the self-educated village preacher of the Baptists, set forth
in his vivid and life-like allegory of the Pilgrim's Progress
(<date value="1678">1678</date>) the Puritan ideal
with a dramatic force and vividness
of characterisation that make it a real prose
<note place="foot" n="40">Bunyan.</note>
poem with no small touch of Elizabethan spontaneity
and freshness. Nor is his Holy War much inferior
to his more popular allegory. Bunyan's were the first great
books in modern English literature written by a man of the
people for the people.</p><p>
15. Prose advanced while poetry declined. Early in the
century a noble standard of good prose style was set almost
unconsciously by the committee of scholars
which drew up the Authorised Version of the
<note place="foot" n="41">The old and the New Prose.
</note>Bible. Yet for the first half of the period the majestic
but involved periods of the great Elizabethans furnished
the model of good composition, while the mass of published
books and pamphlets were dull, formless and unattractive.
The older prose, already admirably set forth
by Hooker, Bacon, and Raleigh, now found varied examples
in Milton's grand plea for a free, unlicensed press in
his Areopagitica, in Clarendon's stately delineation of his
great contemporaries in his History of the Rebellion, in
the poetic and luscious eloquence of Jeremy Taylor, in
the rich meditative soliloquies of Sir Thomas Browne, in



<pb id="p.348" n="348"/>
the quaint humour of Thomas Fuller and the simple idyllic
pictures of Isaac Walton. As men read more widely and
more hurriedly, the style of books began gradually to
assimilate itself to the spoken speech.  Most of the
pamphleteers whom the civil wars produced not unnaturally
fell into a homely and colloquial style, which was more persuasive
and convincing to the vulgar than the sublimities
that illumine Milton's prose works. A crowd of Newspapers
grew up as the result of the eager demand for intelligence
in the exciting period of civil strife, and helped forward the
creation of a natural prose.  Dryden's famous Prefaces
and critical works first gave the new prose the stamp of
a high style and the sanction of a great name.  His
influence is as decisive on the development of our prose
as on the new departure of our poetry.  Before the end
of the century, a nervous, natural, simple, and idiomatic
standard prose had become universally established, and
greatly raised the level of all the journey work of literature,
and of the books whose importance rests in facts or arguments
rather than in their style. For the first time in our
history it became possible for a few popular writers to earn
considerable sums by their pens, so that a professional
literary class was beginning to grow up.</p><p>
Prose literature now became increasingly plentiful and
touched a greater variety of subjects.  The theological
discussions of the age are reflected in the controversial
writings of the Caroline and later Puritan divines. The
political interests of the period found expression even in
the antiquarian researches of a Prynne or a Dugdale, and
still more strongly in the contemporary memoirs, among
which (besides Clarendon's Rebellion) we may mention
Mrs. Hutchinson's Memoirs, Ludlow's Memoirs, and May's
History of the Long Parliament; while the Diaries of the
stately and scholarly John Evelyn, and of the lively and
worldly admiralty clerk, Samuel Pepys, and Roger North's
Lives of the Norths, throw a flood of light on contemporary
manners. There were many translations from the lighter
literature of<placeName key="France">France</placeName>; and most foreign books of importance,
on such subjects as theology, politics and history, were
promptly put into English.  Every school of politicians
now had its literary exponents.  Thomas Hobbes upheld
the absolute power of the State in his famous Leviathan
(<date value="1651">1651</date>), which traced the origin
of society to a social contract,
in which individuals agree with each other to resign
their liberty to the sovereign, who is thus able to secure



   <pb id="p.349" n="349"/>
order and prosperity. Hobbes's rationalistic theory of the
State was displeasing both to his Puritan opponents, such
as Richard Baxter, the prominent Nonconformist divine,
and to the friends of Divine Right, whose views were
a generation later upheld in Filmer's Patriarcha, which
traced all lawful rule back to the patriarchal monarchy set
forth in the book of Genesis. James Harington, in his
Oceana, upheld an aristocratic republic as the ideal form
of government, while John Locke, the friend and dependent
of Shaftesbury, tried to establish on a philosophic basis
the Whig theory of government that triumphed in the
Revolution of <date value="1689">1689</date>.</p></div2>
