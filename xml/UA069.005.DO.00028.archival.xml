        <div1 type="preface" n="Preface" id="front001"><head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>IT was remarked some few years since, concerning London,
by a writer in the <title>Magazine of the Society for the Diffusion
of Useful Knowledge</title>, <quote>" We have, perhaps, no very satis-
factory works upon this vast metropolis in any department,
and the reason for this may be sought for in the almost
limitless variety of aspects which London presents. ... We
are not about to add one more to the many literary failures
that have had London for their theme, by attempting too
much."</quote></p>
  <p>The present volume will not, at all events, be subject
to the complaint referred to by this writer. The object of
its Author has been to sketch in its pages the mere outlines
of the condition, physical, moral, and religious, of a few
of the numerous classes into which the immense population
of London may be divided.  He has endeavoured to por-
tray the features of five only of these classes, finding that






<pb id="p.iv" n="iv"/>

a reference to these, in any way complete or satisfactory
to his own mind, could not be compressed in a shorter
space than a volume of the present size.</p>
 <p> If he meet with encouragement from an indulgent public,
with reference to this mere fragment, he would desire to follow it up by illustrations of other classes of London's masses.
Probably sketches of about twenty classes would comprise
the leading and prominent portions of the poorer orders.
At least, these would furnish to the general reader fair
specimens of the condition of that half of <placeName key="London">London</placeName>, with
which the other half is so generally unacquainted. The
pauper-the lodging-house class-the foreigner-the Jew-
the police-the river and maritime classes-the <placeName key="Spitalfields">Spitalfields</placeName>
weaver-the skilled artizan-the railway class-the coster-
monger-the laundress-the domestic servant-the needle-
woman-and some half-dozen other classes, would together,
in addition to the five classes sketched in the present
volume, constitute a very large proportion, at least, of
the lower masses of "the million-peopled city."  A few
other classes might be considered in connexion with the
larger subjects with which they are identified, as the
publicans of London, in connexion with the important
subject of metropolitan drunkenness; the printer, in con-
nexion with the present state of the London press; such
trades as the shoemaker, in connexion with the Infidelity




 <pb id="p.v" n="v"/>

of London, with which it is almost invariably associated;
and the baking and the milk trades, as representing to a
very large extent the Scotch and the Welsh of London, in
connexion with the very frequent loss of religious habits
on the part of country people on their location in England's
metropolis.</p>
  <p>To the author it appears a matter of that importance
that information should be presented to the Christian
public on the condition of these classes, that, if he only
meet with adequate encouragement in the sale of the present
volume, he will consider it as a part of that duty to which
he desires to consecrate his days, to pursue somewhat
further the subject, if the Lord grant him life and health,
in spite of the numerous and onerous claims which already
so largely occupy his time.</p>
  <p>His especial object in this volume is to illustrate the
condition of the working classes of the metropolis (to which
his attention has been anxiously directed for very many
years), <hi rend="italic">with the design of calling into exercise larger efforts
for their benefit.</hi> It is only necessary to look attentively
at the condition of any class of the working orders, to be
convinced how very much yet remains to be done for its
welfare, and with what great facility further efforts may
immediately be made.    There is in the present volume
what, he trusts, may interest, but he more especially desires




<pb id="p.vi" n="vi"/>


that there may be found in it what may also excite to
sympathy and aid. The popular mind has shown itself of
late to be ready to welcome further information on the
condition of the masses, especially of the metropolis. His
solicitude is that this should be turned to a good account.</p>
  <p>No pretensions are made to literary merit in the present
volume. It is a plain tale. The facts themselves are its
only eloquence. These have been penned in the midst of
incessant interruptions, and at hasty snatches of time.</p>
  <p>The author has considered it important to illustrate what
may, by the Divine blessing, be effected for the moral and
religious benefit of each class of the population referred to,
by relating what has been already effected, especially by the
lay agency, of late years so extensively and so happily called
into exercise-an agency by which, he believes, our working
classes in the metropolis are chiefly to be influenced in the
present day.  He had not intended, on sitting down to
write the book, to give any prominence to the operations
of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName> among these classes, but
to have referred with equal frequency to the operations
of the various kindred Societies. But he found as he
proceeded that this was impracticable, and that with
every desire to follow out his first intentions, his chief
information must be derived from   that Society.  This
arose partly from its records being more accessible to him,



<pb id="p.ix" n="ix"/>


to work; others to play. Some would use their means
temperately; others would enjoy them immoderately. Some
would improve what they got, mending and making and
devising how to turn all to the best account; others would
waste, and break, and spoil, and destroy. Some would deny
themselves and begin to lay by, abstaining for the present
out of regard to the future; others, not caring to look
beyond the pleasure of the passing hour, would gratify their
immediate inclinations at all risk of consequences to come.
. . . And if we could see the same parties after an interval,
not of a day, but of a week, or month, or year, the change
would be more marked, the difference much greater, and the
contrast and its causes far more obvious." <note place="foot" n="1">The Rev. C. Girdlestone.</note></p>
   <p>That which is endeavoured to be enforced in this volume
is simply that the one class is not to live separate from,
unmindful of, and without effort for the benefit of the other.
And if this is the case, as it undoubtedly is, with reference
to the possession of wealth, which is, after all, often pos-
sessed by mere descent, or by purely accidental circum-
stances, and, in all instances, is dependant on the blessing of
God, it is much more the case with reference to the posses-
sion of knowledge and true religion,-those sacred deposits
which cannot, without positive criminality, be retained only
for our own benefit, and thus "laid up in a napkin." " The






<pb id="p.X " n="X"/>


social condition of our working classes has, of late years,
been very closely analyzed. . . And now we seem to have
at last awakened, as from a dream, to the real condition of
these, the great majority of our fellow-creatures.... By
degrees the full truth has burst" (or, rather, as the author
would say, is gradually, but steadily, forcing itself) " upon
us. . . The energy of individuals has called into life many
most valuable Societies, has forced on the Legislature many
wholesome enactments, in aid of moral and sanitary improve-
ment. Much has been done of real and substantial good;
<hi rend="italic">but the revelation of existing evils calls for more and more
active exercise of the spirit which seeks its removal."</hi> <note place="foot" n="2">Viscount Ingestre's " Meliora."
</note></p>
  <p>In the humble hope that the middle and higher classes
may be incited to contemplate and to seek to elevate and
bless the other classes of London's population, this volume is
committed to the press. May the Divine blessing attend its
publication.

           <div2 type="subchapter" n="A distinct Class from Adult Thieves" id="c1s2"> <head>A distinct Class from Adult Thieves.</head>

<p>THIS chapter treats of juvenile, in opposition to adult
thieves. Both classes unhappily exist, and both are very
numerous, so as to require to be separately alluded to.
Both classes, also, are " our neighbours," living in the great
metropolis in close proximity to the respectable portions of
the community. Immediately at the back of stately houses
and noble streets are the courts and the alleys in which
they congregate.  Nor are they "our neighbours" only in
proximity of location, in fellow-citizenship, and as fellow-
parishioners, but also in their possession of the same
immortal nature. Few questions are more suitable for those
who are living in the enjoyment of the Christian and social
privileges of the metropolis, than that which one of old, who
desired "to justify himself," put to our Lord, "And who is
my neighbour ?" The reply taught the lesson that distress
and danger of a special character in themselves generally
pleaded for a neighbour's sympathy.     " He that sheweth
mercy" to the outcast is alone entitled to a neighbour's



<pb id="p.3" n="3"/>

name. Nor is there any class of society towards whom
mercy, kindness, sympathy, and love are more demanded on
the part of all whose aim is to love their neighbour as
themselves, and to do to others as they would that they
should do to them.</p></div2>

   <div2 type="subchapter" n="Their extreme Youth, and sometimes Childhood" id="c1s3"> <head> Their extreme Youth, and sometimes Childhood.</head>
  <p> The age of this " dangerous class" in itself is enough to
move even a hard heart to tender pity on its behalf. In
entering prisons, the benevolent mind is oppressed with
concern; but no circumstance, on such visits, has so filled
the mind of the writer with concern as the vast proportion
of almost children who are immured within their walls.
This, with him, has always predominated over every other
feeling, and he imagines it must have been the same with
others. On a first visit to a gaol, he apprehends every one
must have been startled at the youth of the great mass of the
inmates. The collecting of the prisoners for Divine service
almost resembles the collecting of children to their school.
This is undoubtedly the most affecting sight which a prison
reveals. The writer has visited the prisoner awaiting execu-
tion, under sentence of death for murder, and he has visited
the female wards of a prison. Both these are very pitiable
sights to behold, but the swarms of juvenile prisoners are a
still more pitiable sight; for the murderer is a rare charac-
ter; there is seldom more than a single prisoner of that
description,-not very often even that. And the female
wards of a prison are a mere fraction of the wards in general;
so that, sad as it is to behold females there, some relief is
given, and even thankfulness felt, ordinarily, in discovering
how exceedingly small is the number of female, as com-
pared with male prisoners. But it is surely equally pitiable
to behold a mere child as to behold a woman wearing a
prison-dress, while the discovery that such juvenile offenders





<pb id="p.4" n="4"/>


are the rule rather than the exception, literally overwhelms
the thoughtful mind with concern. <persName key="last,first">Captain William John
Williams</persName>, Inspector of prisons for the Home Department,
very truly remarked, in evidence given by him before a
select Committee of the House of Commons, "I do not
know any fact that can strike any person more sadly than
seeing a child under 9 or 10 years of age in a prison."  In
conversing with this class, the feeling of pity increases; for,
as the Captain adds, "these boys are singularly acute.
They have a degree of precociousness about them which is
quite surprising. Therefore they are older, when young,
than any other class."</p>
 <p> Yet the number of sentences to imprisonment in England
and Wales, under 17 years of age, in 1849, was 10,460;
and in 1850, 9,187.  The number of sentences to trans-
portation, of the same class, was in 1849, 214; and in
1850, 167.</p>
 <p> It appears, from a return of <persName key="Pakington, Sir John">Sir John Pakington</persName>, that of
10,600 offenders under 16 years of age, two-sevenths were
children under 13.</p>
  <p> 1,987 boys, under 17 years of age, were committed to
<orgName key="Westminster House of Correction">Westminster House of Correction</orgName> in the year ending
Michaelmas, 1851; 198 to Giltspur-street Prison; 130 to
the City Bridewell; and 538 to the Brixton House of
Correction.</p>
  <p>To illustrate the mere infancy at which children are
trained to thieve by their parents, a case may be mentioned
which occurred to a <orgName key="City Missionary">City Missionary</orgName> this year. He observed
a child under 7 years of age being led away by a policeman,
for picking the pocket of a lady. As he was, happily, just
too young to be sent to prison (although had he been but a
few months older he would not thus have escaped), the
missionary got possession of him.   He traced out his
mother, who lived in <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, and found that this child




<pb id="p.5" n="5"/>


and his brother, aged 14, were both sent out by her to
obtain money how they could, to support her in vice. The
elder boy had been often in prison. And the younger boy
stated that he could always take home eighteen-pence a-day.
He, therefore, earned half-a-guinea a week, although not
7 years old. Child as he was, he had become so habituated
to theft, that the missionary had the utmost difficulty to
restrain him from his old habits. After a few days he made
his escape with a new pair of boots; and on the day follow-
ing the missionary, after some search, found him at a two-
penny lodging-house for boys and girls, in Seven Dials,
where he had been taken in as a lodger, and the pair of new
boots purchased of him by the landlady for the small sum of
fourpence. Since this rescue, he is proceeding more favour-
ably, and will probably, by God's blessing, be reclaimed
from ruin.</p>
  <p>Is it not worthy of consideration, how far Infant Ragged
Schools may not be important?  They appear not yet to
have been tried. Children of this class are extremely pre-
cocious, and an immense amount of misery and crime might
be prevented by early instruction.</p></div2>

<div2 type="subchapter" n="Great Severity of British, as compared with French, Law on Juvenile Offenders" id="c1s4"><head> Great Severity of British, as compared with French, Law
                  on Juvenile Offenders.</head>
 <p> Mr. Sergeant Adams, in recent evidence before a <orgName key="Com-
mittee of the House of Commons">Com-
mittee of the House of Commons</orgName>, made the following
important statements: viz., that he had had occasion to try
A VAST NUMBER of juvenile offenders, until the recent Act
for giving summary jurisdiction in cases of larceny, upon
children under 14; that he was perfectly confident that,
from the publicity of these trials, the feeling of disgust was
becoming so strong, as to the state of our criminal juris-
prudence with respect to children, that if the cases had not
been removed from public view, the whole system must have



<pb id="p.6" n="6"/>


been changed before this time; that the juries were indignant
at the scenes daily taking place; that from 30 to 40 children,
of ages from 10 to 13, were often brought before him to be
tried and sentenced at the Sessions; and that he had tried a
child as young as 7 years of age, and a vast number of
8 and 9: sometimes for offences as small as stealing a penny
tart.</p>
  <p> The following are two cases which the Learned Sergeant
adduced in his charge to the Grand Jury, in 1849, as illus-
trative of the fearfully juvenile age at which lads become
prisoners:-</p>
  <quote><p> " <persName key="Miller, Thomas ">Thomas Miller</persName>, AGED 8 YEARS, was tried at Clerken-
well, at the August Sessions, 1845, for stealing boxes, and
sentenced to be imprisoned for one calendar month, and once
whipped. At the January Sessions, 1846, he was again
tried at the Clerkenwell Sessions, for robbing a till, and
inquiries being then made, it appeared that, in addition to
the above-mentioned trial, he had also been twice summarily
convicted, and once tried at the Central Criminal Court,
during the year 1846. He was in consequence sentenced
to 7 years' transportation, but his sentence was commuted to
3 months' imprisonment. On March 14, 1846, he was
again convicted of larceny, before the Common Sergeant;
and in the printed sessions cases it is stated that the prisoner
had been in custody 8 or 10 times. He was again sentenced
to transportation, but his sentence was on this occasion
commuted to imprisonment for 2 years. He was discharged
on May 13, 1848. In July, 1848, he was summarily con-
victed, and sentenced to 14 days' imprisonment. From that
period he has been lost sight of in the Middlesex prisons,
until the 4th day of this month (June, 1852), when he was
sentenced, under the Larceny Act, to be whipped and im-
prisoned 2 days. He is now only 12 years of age, and not
more than 4 feet 2 inches in height."

  " This return relates to the committals of this boy to one
prison only."
  The Learned Sergeant, in another part of his evidence,
stated:-</p>
  <p>" Some years ago, I went over the Maidstone Gaol..
I saw a little urchin about 10 years of age, and I said,
'Who is that boy?' 'Oh,' said the Gaoler, 'he has been
committed by the County Magistrates for stealing damsons.'
He had got over a garden-wall, and got a hatful of damsons:
and had been sent to prison for a month."</p>
  <p><persName key="Williams, Captain Wm. John ">Captain Wm. John Williams</persName> also stated, that in <date value="1852-04">April,
1852</date>, on visiting the House of Correction, at <placeName key="Wandsworth,">Wandsworth,</placeName>
lie saw 2 boys of 8 years of age under summary conviction,
placed with the other prisoners.</p>
   <p>Let any respectable parent think for a moment of such a
punishment as imprisonment being inflicted on a son of
theirs of so tender an age, for " stealing a penny tart or a
hatful of damsons," with all the pollution and hardening
consequences of association with the worst of human-kind,



<pb id="p.8" n="8"/>


and the subsequent brand of culprits on their brows. It
may almost be asked, where is the respectable family in
which such offences have not been committed, by those who
are mere children ? How different the parents' chastisement
for such a fault in those of tender years, and the hard
rigour of the law!</p>
   <p>In only the past generation, there were 223 offences
 visited by British law with the punishment of death.  Some
 of these were of the most trivial character. The late <persName key="last,first">Sir
 Fowell Buxton</persName> and <persName key="last,first">Sir James Mackintosh</persName> laboured hard to
 obtain a mitigation of a code so utterly opposed to the mild-
 ness and love of Christianity.  <q type="?">" Life," pleaded Sir Fowell,
 " is sacred, and may not be invaded, without the express
 permission of Him who gave it; and to send an imperish-
 able soul unprepared and unrepentant to a state, perhaps, of
 endless misery (for some little offence), is, I confess, mon-
 strous in my eyes.</q>"  Now, happily, murder alone is punish-
 able with death.</p>
   <p>But the severity of our laws against children is scarcely
less extreme, or more opposed to the genius of our holy and
merciful religion, than its previous imitations of <persName key="Draco">Draco</persName>
rather than <persName key="Christ">Christ</persName>, in the punishment of adults. Is it to
our honour to be less merciful than <placeName key="France">France</placeName> ? And yet by
the Code Napoleon, no child in <placeName key="France">France</placeName> is considered respon-
sible for his acts in the same way as an adult, till the age of
16. Before he has attained that age, he is described as
acting without discernment, sans discernement, or, as the
common law of England expresses it, doli incapax.</p>
  <p>In Great Britain, the age of 7 is substituted for the
French limit of 16-two periods of existence widely dif-
ferent, to our discredit. There is, however, every reason to
hope that the Committee of the House of Commons on
Criminal and Destitute Juveniles, now sitting, will recommend
an abolishment of imprisonment at so early a period of life.

  <p>But if this class demands sympathy, when it is considered
as existing throughout the United Kingdom at large, if
we consider it as existing in London, it should still more
call forth such feelings. The number of juvenile criminals
supplied from the metropolis bears a very large proportion
indeed to the whole number from the country at large, and
while it continues steadily to decrease throughout the
country, it as steadily continues to increase in London.
The reasons of this are probably truly stated by the Recorder
of Birmingham, <persName key="last,first">Matthew D. Hill, Esq</persName>., in the following
paragraph:-</p>
  <p>" I think it will not require any long train of reflection to
shew that in small towns there must be a sort of natural
police, of a very wholesome kind, operating upon the conduct
of each individual, who lives, as it were, under the public
eye; but in a large town he lives, if he choose, in absolute
obscurity, and we know that large towns are sought by way
of refuge, because of that obscurity, which, to a certain
extent, gives impunity.  Again, there is another cause,
which I have never seen much noticed, but which, 'having
observed its operation for many years, I am disposed to
consider very important, and that is, the gradual separation
of classes which takes place in towns by a custom which has
gradually grown up, that every person who can afford it
lives out of town, and at a spot distant from his place of
business. Now this was not so formerly; it is a habit,
which has, practically speaking, grown up within the last
half-century. The result of the old habit was, that rich
and poor lived in proximity, and the superior classes exer-
cised that species of silent but very efficient control over
their neighbours to which I have already referred. They
are now gone, and the consequence is, that large masses of



<pb id="p.10" n="10"/>


population are gathered together without those wholesome
influences which operated upon them when their congrega-
tion was more mixed; when they were divided, so to speak,
by having persons of a different class of life, better educated,
among them. These two causes, namely, the magnitude of
towns and the separation of classes, have acted concurrently,
and the effect has been, that we find in many large towns
which I am acquainted with, that in certain quarters there
is a public opinion and a public standard of morals very
different to what we are accustomed to, and very different to
what we should desire to see. Then the children who are
born amongst those masses, grow up under that opinion, and
make that standard of morals their own, and with them the
best lad or the best man is he who can obtain subsistence, or
satisfy the wants of life, with the least labour, by begging
or by stealing, and who shows the greatest dexterity in
accomplishing his object, and the greatest wariness in
escaping the penalties of the law, and, lastly, the greatest
power of endurance and defiance when he comes under the
lash of the law."</p></div2>

                <div2 type="subchapter" n="Their supposed Numbers" id="c1s6"> <head>Their supposed Numbers.</head>
  <p>This class of persons in London was estimated some time
since, by <persName key="Shaftesbury,Lord">Lord Shaftesbury,</persName> as 30,000. It certainly numbers
20,000, and probably exceeds that large multitude. Each
lad of this number will soon be the head of a family. How
fearful the contemplation! how wide-spread the evil! how
important the application of the remedy!
</p></div2>
          <div2 type="subchapter" n="The Classes from which they are drawn" id="c1s7"><head>The Classes from which they are drawn.</head>
 <p> Contemplate again the classes from which these juvenile
thieves are obtained, and the claim which they present on
our compassion is still further increased. The enumeration
given on this subject, with reference to the very excellent



<pb id="p.11" n="11"/>


<orgName key="Reformatory Juvenile Institution at Mettray">Reformatory Juvenile Institution at Mettray</orgName>, in <placeName key="France">France</placeName>, is
equally applicable to England and to London. Juvenile
thieves are said, in the Mettray Report, to be made up of:-
1. The children of criminals. These are hereditary criminals.
They are often trained to crime, and are practically taught
to think lightly of it, even when they are not expressly taught
to consider it a merit, as is too often the case. This forms a
class, the numbers of which are in proportion to the number
of the whole class. 2. Illegitimate children. The testimony
of inspectors of prisons, of gaolers, and of chaplains to
gaols, is uniform to the fact that these constitute a very large
class of juvenile criminals. 3. Orphans. 4. Foundlings and
step-children. 5. The children of the very poor.</p>
  <p><q type="?">Now let the reader consider what he would be, or what

  <p>But some may ask, Have these youth never been taught?
They have. But what? They have gone to school to learn
-to thieve. This has been their education.</p>
  <p>Regular schools for the training of boys in thieving have
long existed in London. The discovery of such a school, in
1585, by Fleetwood, the Recorder, is thus related:</p>
  <p><quote>"Among the rest they found out one Wotton, a gentleman
born, and some time a merchant of good credit, but fallen by
time into decay. This man kept an alehouse at Smart's Key,
near Billingsgate, and after for some misdemeanor put down,
he reared up a new trade of life; and in the same house he
procured all the cut-purses about the city to repair to his
house. There was a school-house set up to learn young boys
to cut purses. Two devices were hung up: one was a
pocket, and another was a purse. The pocket had in it



<pb id="p.12" n="12"/>


certain counters, and was hung up with hawk's-bells, and
over the top did hang a little scaring-bell; the purse had
silver in it; and he that could take out a counter without
any noise, was allowed to be a public foyster; and he that
could take a piece of silver out of the purse, without noise of
any of the bells, was adjudged a judicial nypper, according
to their terms of art. A foyster was a pick-pocket; a nypper
was a pick-purse or cut-purse."</quote> <note place="foot" n="1">Maitland's " London," i., 269, from Stow's "Survey."
</note></p>
  <p> Nearly 200 years afterwards, the "Annual Register" for
1756, under date of March 25, thus describes a similar
school:</p>
  <p> "<quote>At an examination of four boys detected at picking
pockets, before the <persName key="Mayor, Lord">Lord Mayor</persName>, one of them, admitted as
evidence, gave the following account:-A man who kept a
public-house near Fleet-market, had a club of boys, whom he
instructed in picking pockets and other iniquitous practices.
He began by teaching them to pick a handkerchief out of
his own pocket, and next his watch, by which means the
evidence at last became so great an adept that he got the
publican's watch four times in one evening, when the master
swore that his scholar was as perfect as one of 20 years'
practice. The pilfering out of shops was the next art. In
this his instructions to his pupils were, that at such
chandler's or other shop as had hatches, one boy should
knock for admittance for some trifle whilst another was
lying on his belly close to the hatch, who, when the first
boy came out, the hatch remaining on jar and the owner
being withdrawn, was to crawl in on all-fours, and take the
tills or anything else he could meet with, and to retire in
the same manner. Breaking into shops by night was the
third article; which was to be effected thus. As brick
walls under shop windows are generally very thin, two of
them were to lie under a shop-window as destitute beggars




<pb id="p.13" n="13"/>


asleep in appearance to passers by; but, when alone, were
with pickers to pick the mortar out of the bricks, and so on,
till they had opened a hole big enough to go in, when one
was to lie, as if asleep, before the breach, till the other
accomplished his purpose.</quote>"</p>
  <p>It is remarked in Knight's "London:"-
  <quote>"Dexterous and accomplished as are the followers of the
several varieties of illegal industry in London, perhaps above
those of any other community in the world, their genius has
not, at least in modern times, shone with any remarkable
lustre in the inventive line. Their favourite modes of
entrapping their prey seem to be nearly the same in the
present day as they were two or three hundred years ago...
pocket-picking in all its forms was practised as cleverly, and
taught'as elaborately, in the London of the times of Elizabeth
and James as by the ... hidden real life of our own day. But
probably the reason of this is really the excellence of these
old tricks and wiles-their perfect serviceableness for their
purpose, and nice accordance with the principles of human
nature, as proved by the wonderful success with which they
continue to be employed, after having been in use for so long
a series of years ; innovation is not to be heedlessly ventured
upon in pocket-picking any more than in politics."</quote> <note place="foot" n="2">Vol. iv., pp. 225-6.</note></p>
   <p>In illustration of the truth of these observations, one of
 the missionaries of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName> states:-</p>
   <p>"<q type="spoken">I found on my appointment to this district, a room
 opened on it, in which children of both sexes were instructed
 on the doll. The image of a lady or gentleman was dressed
 up, and suspended from the roof. A purse was placed in
 the pocket, containing sixpence. A bell hung inside. The
 youths who could extract the purse, without causing the bell
 to ring, got the sixpence.  This instruction I have seen
 given</q>.</p>




<pb id="p.14" n="14"/>


   <p><quote>"Another mode of training for theft is still practised by
 a man who keeps several boys, and lives by their plunder.
 He trains them on his own pockets, or on the pocket of the
 female with whom he lives.</quote></p>
   <p>"<quote>But the more common mode of training is in lodging-
 houses kept for this class. They practise on each other, the
 most expert always acting as teacher. This is the mode in
 which most of those who have been passed through my
 hands have been trained."</quote></p>
  <p> Nor is the disposal of stolen property very materially
different now to what it was. A second missionary of the
<orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName> states:-</p>
   <p>"<q type="?">I could at this day undertake, without difficulty, to
dispose of 1,0001. of stolen property of any description,
whether in money or in goods, in five minutes' time, at one
place on the district, for which I should get one-third of
the real value.  A  second third is taken off the price
of sale, so that stolen goods are to be bought at two-thirds
their price, and the remaining third is considered an equi-
valent for the risk which is run in dealing in stolen property.
There are, probably, thirty more parties known to me in the
district, to whom I could dispose of almost anything which
was moveable, in cart or by hand, at the same rate. Boys
dispose of stolen goods to these dealers, as easily as men
or women."</q></p>
  <p>The following truly remarkable case, related by one
of the missionaries of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName>, as having
recently occurred to him, illustrates the fearful amount
of iniquity which may arise from a single individual in the
corrupting of youth. While walking down one of the
new streets in the East of London, he was followed by
two youths. Proceeding onwards, he came up to six men,
standing at the end of a narrow street. He saw at once to
what class they belonged, and addressed them. The two



<pb id="p.15" n="15"/>


youths halted, and joined in with the party. They were
evidently acquainted with each other. The men gave just
such an answer as might be expected to the inquiry, whether
they had no employment, viz., that they were out of work.
The missionary gave them to understand that he was
perfectly aware of their calling, and told them at once who
he was, and that his object in addressing them was to benefit
them. He then appealed to them, whether they were really
happy? on which one of them replied, " Well, Sir, as you
have been so plain with me, I will tell you that I am not
happy; and that if I had the chance of getting an honest
livelihood, I should be very glad." As he said this, he
pulled from his pocket a religious tract much soiled. It was
a tract which had been given him by another missionary
of that Society. "That," said he, " is among the things
that make me unhappy!" The missionary gave him his
card, and told him that if he would call on him at <placeName key="Westmin-
ster,">Westmin-
ster,</placeName> he would see whether he could not do something
for him. He came. The missionary promised to get him
into a Reformatory Institution, which he had established for
repentant thieves. He accepted the offer with great thank-
fulness. During four months which he continued there, he
gave satisfactory proof of his sincerity, and of the change
produced in his mind. He has since emigrated for <placeName key="America">America</placeName>.
This man had for 20 years been leading a criminal life, and
had been in prison more than 20 times. He had resided in
a low lodging-house, where he had lived by taking in boys,
and training them to pick pockets. The best hands among
them were sent into the streets, and brought home the
plunder for their common support. <q type="?"> "But," said he, " I
never could keep the young 'uns long. As soon as they
became clever at their profession, if they were not taken by
the police, they would leave me, and start for themselves,



<pb id="p.16" n="16"/>


which obliged me to look out for new hands.</q>"  The mis-
sionary asked him why he did not go out himself, instead of
exposing these young lads to danger ?  He said, the reason
was, because he was himself too well known to the police, and
they would follow him whenever they saw him. The missionary
then asked him how many boys he had trained ? The per-
fectly fearful answer which he gave was, that he could not
exactly tell, but he should think he had not had fewer than
five hundred!</p>
  <p>What an amount of evil among the juvenile population
had this one man effected! And what an amount of good
has the small sum expended on his reclamation, by God's
blessing, effected ! Who can fail to see how much better
it is, financially as well as morally, to seek rather to reform
than to punish, especially where there is a willingness
to reform ?</p>
  <p>And yet to how small an extent has this more economical,
more merciful, and more Christian plan been pursued ! In
one street only, in the south of London, there now exist
1,500 destitute and criminal juveniles, for whom there is
not even a school provided; and in another single street, in
the east of London, 1,000 children of a similar class were
found last year without any other school than one conducted
by Papists in a private dwelling-house. Is it to be wondered
at that juvenile crime exists, and even increases, in the
metropolis, when the class from which it springs is so
often neglected? What else, under such circumstances, can
be expected, but that it should be perpetuated and multi-
plied ?</p>
  <p>It ought also distinctly to be understood, that there are
very many indeed of this class who are willing to be
reformed, and brought under Christian instruction and
training, and that the means only are requisite to enable



<pb id="p.17" n="17"/>


them to carry out their desires. One of the missionaries of
the <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, met with fifty such cases recently
in one night.
</p>
           </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Their Gradations in Proficiency" id="c1s9"><head>Their Gradations in Proficiency.</head>
<p>   In accordance with their training, the pupils differ much
from each other.  There are numerous grades and sub-
divisions in the juvenile thieving department of crime. A
certain class of boys do nothing but steal provisions from
shop-doors, and sell the provisions they get to lodging-house
keepers. There is another class of boys who pick men's
pockets, but never touch a woman's. Another class pursue
the more difficult employment of picking women's pockets,
and give themselves entirely up to what, in a sad insen-
sibility to crime, they call " that branch of business."
Others addict themselves entirely to stealing tills, or, as it
is ordinarily called, " drawing the damper."

<p>  In what way are they to be taught what is right ? How
are they most effectually to be rescued from ruin ?</p>
 <p> The following is the suggestion of an able leading article
which appeared in the "Times" newspaper some years
since. After adverting to the fearful present condition of
many parts of London, in which juvenile thieves are nur-
tured and matured, the writer proceeds:-</p>
 <p> " It is in these wretched districts that herds of men, but
little removed from the savage state, are grouped. It is
from these regions that the population of our gaols is
supplied; and in these eddies of civilized society is gathered
all the filth, the crime, the savage recklessness, which is
subsequently carried to the Antipodes, and causes the sad
and melancholy statement from New Zealand, that the white
                              c




<pb id="p.18" n="18"/>              CRIMINAL AND DESTITUTE

settlers have more to fear from the white man, their country-
man, a member once of a refined state of society, than they
have to dread from the savage and the cannibal!   But
whence came this white savage? From this vast metro-
polis, the seat of wealth, splendour, and refinement! It is
in the purlieus of crime that the zealous should labour
to disseminate the holy precepts of our religion, and man
there dwelling  should be taught the relative duties of
society. This is the fountain-head of that dark stream of
pollution, and it is at the source that the evil should be
grappled.  This is the plainest and most common-sense
preventive. Home missionaries and well-directed philan-
thropy would do more real service to the cause of humanity
than at first might strike the imagination. It would be a
check to crime, and it would be in these districts that the
zealous missionary would meet the offender fresh from
prison, before he has time to relapse into evil courses, and
the observations made by him on the subsequent habits of
offenders, would afford to the Legislature a greater insight
into the workings of any system than any commissioners'
reports.  The greater difficulty in working out this plan
,would be the selection of persons of talent, who, while they
ought to possess a thorough knowledge of mankind, should
be careful not to allow their religious exhortations to dwindle
into drawling cant; for the thief is no fool-if he was, he
would not be fit for a thief. The object would fail in its
effect if it became a laughing-stock in the eyes of these
strangely-organized, or rather disorganized, members of
society; who, though they might abhor the cannibal for
eating a human being, yet have no objection themselves to
prey upon their fellow-creatures.  The home missionary
would have great opportunity of observing the sincerity of
men who, having undergone imprisonment, might wish to
reform. His opportunities would be far greater, and likely




                       <pb id="p.19" n="19"/>

to be far more correct, than of any chaplain in a prison, who
sees his man caged and cooped in a cell.</p>
  <p> <quote>The reports of these persons would enable the philan-
thropist to recommend some honest course to a man disposed
to avoid his former evil associations: he might be enabled
to assist him in free emigration. In short, the benefits
would be so clear, and the want of these benefits is so
glaring, that it is much to be hoped the high Prelates of the
land may peruse, approve, and ultimately urge the Ministry
to adopt these simple, but efficient, plans to prevent juvenile
and adult crime, and save this country the disgrace of sending
out a population more brutal than a savage, and more savage
than a brute.</quote>"</p>

  <p>" How are the children [of Ragged Schools] admitted ?-
The children are admitted in many cases by personal appli-
cation; they are admitted in many other cases by the teachers
going round and seeking for them, <hi rend="?">and by the assistance of
the city missionaries (agents of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName>),
who have been exceedingly useful to us from the very first,
not only in finding scholars, but in helping to establish
schools, and in getting the goodwill of parents towards us
and our operations.</hi></p>
  <p>"Be good enough to describe shortly the duties and
character of the Institution to which you have just referred;
that term has occurred in the course of the evidence several
times ?-It is a Society, consisting of 275 missionaries, who
visit from house to house daily for six hours a-day. Their
business is to read the Scriptures to the poor, to engage in
prayer with them, and to have stated meetings on certain
days in the week for the purpose of expounding the Scrip-
tures to all whom they can get to assemble-to visit the
poor, especially in sickness; and it has occurred, that thou-
sands who have died in London in the low neighbourhoods
have had no one to visit them or attend them on their death-
beds except the City missionary.</p>
  <p>"Are they members of the <orgName key="Church of England">Church of England</orgName> exclu-
sively?-No, not exclusively; they consist of members of
both <orgName key="Church of England">Church of England</orgName> and Dissenting congregations; the
Committee, likewise, I may as well observe, is, like our own
Committee, on quite an unsectarian basis,-Dissenters and
Churchmen working together harmoniously in carrying the
Gospel into the lowest parts of London.</p>
   <p>"Can you inform the Committee how long that Society





<pb id="p.22" n="22"/>

has existed ?-About 17 years, during which time it has
done more for the poor of London than any other Society
I know."

  Duties of Parents.</head>
  <p>There are two main difficulties in the way of schools in
general, from which <orgName key="Ragged Schools">Ragged Schools</orgName> are particularly free.
One arises from the differences of religious sects, and which
has so continually presented itself, that it has stood in the
way, perhaps more than any other cause, of educational
progress among the lower classes. But this really has no
existence in the matter of <orgName key="Ragged Schools">Ragged Schools</orgName>. When, there-
fore, the <orgName key="Recorder of Birmingham">Recorder of Birmingham</orgName> was asked, in his recent
examination before a <orgName key="Committee of the House of Commons,">Committee of the House of Commons,</orgName>
with reference to the extension of <orgName key="Ragged Schools">Ragged Schools</orgName>, " Do you
think that the differences which have existed upon religious
matters in various classes of the community would create
additional difficulty ?" he gave the pertinent reply:-</p>
  <p>" The only difficulty I apprehend exists among those who,
like yourself and your class of society, are discussing it.
With regard to these poor creatures themselves, they have
scarcely any religious differences; and I rather think, that
if inquiry were made among the governors and chaplains of
gaols, the Committee would find the provision for calling in
the aid of other denominations than that of the Church of
England very rarely indeed put in action. The truth is,
that the class from which criminals are drawn have no
religion at all. They are not divisible into Roman Catholics
and Protestants. They are for the most part practically
heathens."</p>
 <p> Efforts have been made occasionally to establish <orgName key="Church
of England Ragged Schools">Church
of England Ragged Schools</orgName>, and, as is generally the case in





                                     <pb id="p.23" n="23"/>

such exclusive movements, with High Church patronage;
but as might be expected, the efforts have been almost
invariably miserable failures. It is only to be regretted
that they should ever have been made. Certainly the credit
of the <orgName key="Church of England">Church of England</orgName> has not been promoted thereby.</p>
  <p>A second objection, sometimes made against schools, is,
that the training of the children is taken out of the parents'
hands, on whom it devolves by the law of nature. Even to
the present day this is strongly felt, so far as the conducting
them to public worship is concerned, by the Scotch, than
whom no part of our population are more sensible of the
value of education. But in the case of Ragged Schools, at
all events, this objection has little force. For the children
almost invariably either cannot tell who are their parents,
or their parents are utterly unfitted to teach them what is
good, being themselves the victims of vice and iniquity.

 <p> Something approaching to the system of Ragged Schools

by <persName key="Macgregor,John">John Macgregor</persName>, Esq., M.A., one of the most active
members of the <orgName key="Ragged School Union Committee">Ragged School Union Committee</orgName>:-</p>
   <p>"Isolated efforts there were, no doubt, both numerous
and effective, from the time when men first cared for the

most of these will be found, on examination, to want one or
other of those essential features which constitute a <orgName key="Ragged
School">Ragged
School</orgName>-[i.e.] a school in which the most squalid, filthy,

  <p>" <quote>The first [<orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName>, in the strict sense of the
term] in London was in the old stable where Walker
taught,</quote>" according to Mr. <persName key="Macgregor">Macgregor's</persName> statement. This
"Walker" is one of the missionaries of the London City
Mission, and the "old stable" was at <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. The
following most touching account of its formation was written
in <date value="1840">1840</date>, four years before the London <orgName key="Ragged School Union">Ragged School Union</orgName>
was formed, by <persName key="Wilson, George">Mr. George Wilson</persName>, of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, and
was published in the same year. It was two years previous
to this date that the school was first formed in a smaller
room, which could only be had on Sundays.</p>
  <p>" A lamentable destitution of the Scriptures prevailed in
all the <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> districts previous to the late supply
afforded to the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName> by the <orgName key="British and
Foreign Bible Society">British and
Foreign Bible Society</orgName>. On visiting one house in Duck-lane,
the missionary now on this district was met by the man who
kept it, who told him he had better pass on, for no one there
or in the next house wanted his assistance. The missionary,
however, got into conversation with this man and drew him
out, and learned that all the inhabitants were thieves or
coiners; that several who had formerly belonged to the gang
had been executed, and many of them up stairs were returned





                                    <pb id="p.25" n="25"/>

convicts. He expressed his earnest wish to see them, and
the man, who gave his card, ' <hi rend="italic">The Chelsea Snob, Professor
of Pugilism,</hi>' said, 'Well, I will accompany you, and protect
you from insolence.' The missionary went up and saw them
all. He was received respectfully, and subsequently supplied
them with the Testament and Psalter. It appeared a most
unpromising soil, but extraordinary results followed some
months afterwards. At another little hut in a back court,
when he opened the door he found a travelling tinker,
preparing his barrow to go out to mend tin ware and grind
knives. In reply to the question, ' Have you a Bible?' he
swore vehemently, and replied, ' Yes.' The missionary said,
'What sort of a religion do you learn from it that lets
you swear so?' He said, 'Religion ! Oh, you shall see my
religion if you are not off!' and, opening a cupboard,
he whistled to two great dogs which were used for fighting at
Duck-lane Theatre.  ' There,' he said, 'that's my religion.'
The missionary talked with him, and subsequently gave him
a Testament, and invited him to his room. To the surprise
of the missionary he came, brought his Testament with him,
followed the missionary in his readings, was most attentive,
and brought other men of the same trade as himself. The
missionary called at his residence frequently, but could not
find him at home for two or three months. He learned from
the wife, however, that the dogs were sold, and he had told
her, that sport was all over with him now. When the
missionary got an opportunity to see him, he found him
a broken-hearted penitent.</p>
  <p>" After some time it was proposed to get the children
together out of the streets to the room on the Lord's-day, to
instruct them, and the missionary, in giving this notice
at his room, asked any person who could, to come and help
to teach them. The poor tinker kept back until the last,
and then said that he was not much of a scholar, but if he





<pb id="p.26" n="26"/>

could do anything, such as go round and persuade the
children to come, or be useful in any other way, he should
be glad to help. His services were accepted, and, although
that took place nearly two years back, the tinker has never
been absent but one Sunday, and that was through illness.
He is the first in the school and the last out.   While
he is endeavouring to teach others his own mind has opened,
and his walk and conversation have been becoming the
Gospel.<note place="foot" n="1">Since the above was written he has been appointed, by the club of
tinkers like himself, a sort of steward or visitor of their sick and
infirm members; he has, in consequence, been obliged to leave the
school, but carries with him to the bed-sides of those he visits the glad
news of salvation by the <persName key="Christ, Jesus">Lord Jesus Christ</persName>.</note>  We had a pleasing testimony as to his private
habits in the following way:-A poor wretched girl was
found living in sin, who appeared penitent; but a difficulty
arose, for we could not meet any poor virtuous person at the
moment who would take her in and shelter her until an
asylum could be obtained: and we find it necessary to
do this while the good impression is upon such characters,
or else, if they return to their former mode of subsistence,
we fear the opportunity for reclaiming them is lost. Well,
in this difficulty the poor tinker said, ' Let her go to my wife,
and I will sleep in the shed for a few nights.' She did so.
Since then she has been got into a situation, where she
is going on well. When the missionary called, after a time,
to see how she got on, the mistress said, ' Oh, she wants
a <persName key="Bible">Bible</persName>; for the tinker used to read the <persName key="Bible">Bible</persName> and pray with
them morning and night, and charged her to do so; but she
has not got one, and she wishes to do what the tinker
told her-he was such a good man, and so anxious for her
welfare.' 'Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir-tree.'
Truly the most humble, when blessed with the grace of God
themselves, become blessings to others.
</p>





<pb id="p.27" n="27"/>


  <p>"The school was formed; 44 children were gotten
together on the first Sunday. Very few of them had shoes,
not many had shirts; some little fellows made a ludicrous
appearance, having their fathers' coats on, which just came
above their heads, while the tail reached to the ground.
This buttoned up served to cover the want of shirt and
other under-clothing.  Thirty-eight of them could not tell
their letters, never having been to school before: for such
the missionary sought in his visits, and I believe all of them
were fetched on the day by him, and brought in his hand.
He worked very hard; they were remarkably attentive and
anxious to learn: and when, after two or three Sundays, we
had a reward-viz., a little piece of pasteboard with the
prayer printed on it, 'Create in me a clean heart,' with a
long piece of red tape to suspend it round the neck, and to
be given in each class to the child who could repeat most
perfectly a verse or two of Scripture which they had been
taught on the former Sunday-there was as much anxiety
to obtain it as though it had been a medal of gold; and the
successful competitor, in dirt and rags, appeared to think
himself highly honoured for once.</p>
  <p>It was soon found that these children lost in the week
all the good they had gained on the Lord's-day. They spent
their time playing in the streets, and were idle, vicious, and
dissolute: their extreme poverty (owing frequently to the
vice of the parents, many of whom were thieves or prosti-
tutes) prevented them either from paying even a penny per
week, or from attending those schools, open gratuitously
to the poor, but who were expected to come clean and decent.
We therefore resolved to open a large room for the reception
of such children only, and try the experiment for three
months. A stable in <placeName key="Pie-street">Pie-street</placeName> was obtained and fitted up,
and here we have an average attendance of about 120
children, all of this wretchedly poor class. Some of them





<pb id="p.28" n="28"/>

have scarcely sufficient clothes to cover them decently, very
few shoes or stockings, but all who come are, without
exception, received and attended to. Any children of this
kind met with by the missionaries in their visitations are
brought to this school.  Their names are arranged in
districts, and the list of absentees in each district is given to
the missionary thereof every Monday morning, who, in the
course of the week, visits their abodes and reports the cause
of absence; and this attention to the poor, outcast, and
hitherto-neglected children of these very poor and wretched
persons, has amazingly won upon the parents and delighted
them, while the missionaries, by this, amongst other means,
gain a growing esteem in the hearts of the people.</p>
  <p>The expense of fitting up this school and paying the
master has been great; but it has been borne entirely by
private subscription, and has in no way entrenched on the
funds of the Mission. The present superintendent of the
district is the treasurer, who receives subscriptions.  A
lady of title, whose name I cannot mention without feelings
of respect and gratitude, has taken a great interest in this
school, wretched as is the neighbourhood and the school-
room, and the class of children who meet there; yet she has
attended the school, assisted in its working, brought others
to see it, and obtained those subscriptions which have met
its expenses, but without which it could not have been
carried on. It has now been open about ten months. Other
kind ladies have also lent assistance, and <persName key="Mr. Dunn">Mr. Dunn</persName>, of the
<orgName key="British and Foreign School Society">British and Foreign School Society</orgName>, has kindly given his
advice and obtained books, &#x0026;c.; and, if such help be con-
tinued, there is every reason to hope the school will continue
to prosper and be a blessing to these poor outcasts.</p>
  <p>" In this school-room the meetings are held for prayer and
reading the Scriptures; and since the lodging-houses have
been well visited, and the school established, the inmates of





<pb id="p.29" n="29"/>

those places and the parents of the school children have
attended in such numbers as to fill the place. Latterly the
singing has been led by a beggar-man, who sings in the
streets, whom the missionary met with at one of the lodging-
houses, and who had never attended a place of worship before.</p>
<p>  " An incident, which much affected my mind, occurred at
this room when first the public-houses were closed on the
Lord's-day morning. Two women, with children in their
arms, came one evening and requested the missionary to
thank God for having put it into the heart of the Legislature
to close the gin-shops, &#x0026;c. on the Sunday. They said their
husbands were coal-porters, and, until then, had not for years
been sober on a Sunday; but now they dined comfortably at
home, with their families and wives; and children and
fathers were all so happy together. They entreated him to
pray that God would be pleased to incline our rulers to
perfect the work, and have them closed all the Sabbath-day.</p>
<p>  " One of the poor boys in the <orgName key="New Pie-street School">New Pie-street School</orgName> has
lately died, and the following is a verbatim statement, taken
down from the missionary's lips, of what he has known and
learned of the boy during his illness --.The day or two
before he died, he called his sister, a girl about nine years
of age, to his bed-side, and told her what a bad girl she was
to her parents, and where she would go if she did not seek a
new heart from God. He entreated her to obey her parents
and to keep the Sabbath. He said that he was about to go
to heaven, but there she could never come except she sought
mercy through <persName key="Christ, Jesus">Jesus Christ</persName>. He then called his mother-
told her what a bad woman she was, never to go to God's
house, or pray, or read the Bible, or care for the Saviour;
and if she died so, she would go to hell. Those were his
very words. ' Oh!' he said, 'pray for a new heart!' He
then called his father, and told him, 'I am going to my
heavenly Father, where,' he said, 'you can never come,




<pb id="p.30" n="30"/>

unless your sins be pardoned and your heart changed.' He
blessed his teachers, and the missionary, who, he said, had
told him of <persName key="Christ, Jesus">Jesus Christ</persName> dying for sinners such as lie was.
He requested his mother, with great solemnity, to tell his
grandmother to pray to God for pardon, or she would go to
hell. Those were his words. The boy died, and the grand-
mother fell sick the same week with inflammation of the
stomach; and the words of the boy deeply affected her mind.
The missionary never visited her (and he did so daily)
without her mentioning these words.  She was directed to
the Saviour-she sought for mercy: she has recovered from
her sickness, and attends constantly the Wesleyan chapel.
The missionary met, at this poor old woman's bed-side,
during her illness, one of her daughters from the East-end
of London, who had been a great sinner. He pressed on
her the necessity of seeking the salvation of her soul. She
was deeply impressed, but lamented that her husband was a
Socialist.  The missionary lent her <persName key="Ainslie">Mr. Ainslie's</persName> lecture,
'Is there a God?' and Mr. Garwood's, 'Is the Bible of
Divine Authority?' for her husband to read. He did so.
When she was going again to see her mother, she told her
husband she must take the books back. He said, 'Ask him
to lend them me another week or two-I must read them
again.' He has done so, and he has thanked the missionary
for them, saying, 'They are very convincing ;' and he has
given up the Socialist meeting, and allows his wife to attend
the house of God."

  <p>"<placeName key="New Pie-street, Westminster">New Pie-street, Westminster</placeName>.- This school for the

others get their bread by selling various articles about the
streets, and it may be stated, that three-fourths of them are
probably deeply engaged in crime.<note place="foot" n="1">Printed prospectus of the school.</note>  It was opened origin-
ally as a Sunday-school, but it was found 'that the good
effects of the Sunday's teaching were done away by the
mischievous influence of domestic habits and example during
the week. With a view to remedy this, a day-school was
formed in addition to the Sunday-school. A few persons
hired a stable, by way of experiment, for three months; this
was rudely fitted up as a school-room, when, to their
surprise, no less than to their gratification, they had in
a few weeks 120 children. For some time past there have
been 170 in constant attendance, and at the present time the
names of 200 and upwards are upon the books.'     The
accommodation afforded in this building is of the humblest
kind. The tiled roof remains without a ceiling; the floor is
only partially boarded; no ventilation could carry off the
exhalations inseparable from such a spot. Nevertheless, it
has satisfactorily served the purpose of the experiment that
has been tried in it, and the attendance being steady and
increasing, the influential persons who have interested them-
selves about the formation of this school, and contributed to
its support, now contemplate an attempt to provide funds for
a proper building.</p>
<p>  " The appearance of the children sufficiently denoted the
class to which they belonged. Many were without shoes or
stockings; almost all were of English parents; some were so
ill-clad, that their naked skin appeared through many parts
of their tattered clothing; all were equally dirty, the effect
of extreme poverty or domestic depravity, and therefore its
correction was very properly left to time. They were ranged
on forms for want of desks, of which the confined space does
not admit of a sufficient number. The master stated, that






<pb id="p.32" n="32"/>

'by talking kindly to the new-comers, they became after a
little time willing to learn.' Eighteen out of seventy boys
present could read fairly; thirty could write a word on their
slates; six wrote on paper. They were classed in three
divisions, by which the master was able to give his personal
attention to each for nearly an hour during every school
time, in addition to the scriptural lesson addressed to them
all. They expressed pleasure when they found themselves
learning something, and in some instances, when they were
able to read, they were glad to be allowed to take home a
book to read to their parents. Some good results are said
to have been traced to occasions of this kind. It caused
evident and very natural satisfaction to them to perceive
that the darkness and confusion of ignorance was giving
place in their minds to new ideas, and that instead of the
neglect, perhaps aversion, to which their poverty had made
them familiar elsewhere in the school, they met with nothing
but kind treatment, and consideration for their deficiencies.
No prizes or rewards, no gifts of clothing, or bribes in any
shape for attendance, were allowed, neither were punish-
ments, except of the slightest kind, and those seldom found
necessary.  The apparatus is scanty, consisting only of
twelve Bibles, six copy-books, a few lesson-boards, and
three slates.. They had learnt to sing by ear a few songs
and hymns. The school is dismissed daily with a short,
impressive, and appropriate prayer. On passing out of the
school many seemed pleased to exchange salutations with
the master, and some advanced to him for a friendly shake
of the hand. ' Christian instruction and Christian benevo-
lence' had awakened their sympathies, and led them to feel that
'the world and the world's law' was not altogether against
them.   Some were the children of known thieves; some
had themselves been habituated to thieving; others were
orphans; and all belong to the poorest and most destitute




<pb id="p.33" n="33"/>

grade of life. The instruction was of course gratuitous, and
care was said to be taken not to abstract any from schools
where payment was enforced, and also not to admit those
whose parents could afford to send them elsewhere. It was
found, indeed, that very few of the latter would, under any
circumstances, allow their children to mix with the class of
which this school is composed. It is stated, that before it
was opened, no fewer than eighteen children had been
transported from families now sending children to it, but
that since it has been in operation there has not been one.
'The same benevolent persons <note place="foot" n="2"><placeName key="Missionaries of the London City Mission">Missionaries of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName></placeName></note> who have induced the
children to attend the school, endeavour to secure that they
do so regularly; they use every argument to persuade the
parents to send them, and they call almost daily to satisfy
themselves that the children are present; they also go to the
residences of the absentees to ascertain the reason of their
non-attendance.' A part of the stable was fitted up as an
infant-school, and contains 100. They are taught in the
method of the Infant-school Society, by a mistress who has
received instruction at that establishment, and who had
succeeded in making some progress with the different
materials with which she had to deal. Twenty-four had
learnt to read the lesson-boards; 8 could read in the Testa-
ment, and could repeat texts with accuracy and intelligence;
16 could work with the needle; a few were taught to scour
and clean the school-room. They were furnished only with
a few slates, on which some had learnt to write, and also a
little ciphering. While the eldest class is at needlework,
one of the number reads a story to the rest from a book.
They were able to repeat hymns and other simple pieces of
poetry, and took an interest in the scriptural and other
subjects to which their attention was directed.</p>
  <p>"I made a subsequent visit to this school, with the view






<pb id="p.34" n="34"/>

of endeavouring to satisfy myself by personal inquiries to
what class of society the children attending it belonged; and
whether it was probable that they were withdrawn to any
extent from other schools, where payments were required
and regularity of attendance enforced, and attracted to this
by the circumstance of its being gratuitous, and by the
absence of any attempt to make neatness and cleanliness of
dress and person a rule and a characteristic. Sixty boys
were present; and of these, taken seriatim, I obtained from
the master the following particulars:-</p>
  <p>" Seven had been at other schools, 4 of them at National,
3 at British; 2 of the former had been dismissed for irre-
gularity of attendance: the parents of the remaining 5 were
said to be too poor to dress them decently, and to provide
the weekly payments.</p>
  <p>"Twenty-five were the children of parents in various
grades, of very humble employment, having from 2 to 5
young children each, and subject to be frequently without
work altogether. A few of these had 1 child at a school
where payments are made, but were unable to afford to pay
for more, or to procure proper and decent clothing for them.</p>
  <p>"Eleven had lost their fathers, and were supported by
their mothers, having also from 2 to 4 children each to
provide for: the mothers of three sold fruit in the streets;
2 more sold herrings and fire-wood; 3 were women. It was
stated that the mother of one was often obliged to earn a
trifling sum by her morning's occupation before she could
provide a breakfast for her child, which she brought to him
to the school; the child of another remained frequently at
the school all day without food, the mother bringing some
when she was able.</p>
  <p>"Five had been deserted by their parents, and were
dependent on the sympathy of neighbours.</p>
  <p>"Five were the children of men of notoriously bad




<pb id="p.35" n="35"/>

characters, one of them a known thief: one of the former
had come to the school to hear his child read, which he was
unable to do himself, and expressed much surprise.</p>
   <p>"One was an orphan, supported by relatives.</p>
   <p>" One the son of a blind beggar.</p>
  <p> "Four were engaged in employments that kept them up a
great part of the night, or occupied them from an early hour
in the morning; they consequently came to school only in
the afternoon: one of these was employed to sell bread and
cold meat to the waggoners, drovers, &#x0026;c., coming into
London to the markets, or in some similar occupation;
another sold ginger-beer in the streets to a late hour; a
third sold lucifer-matches; a fourth, water-cresses, &#x0026;c.,
early in the morning.</p>
  <p>" Six only were the children of parents whose general
condition might enable them to pay for the instruction of
their children, and 2 of these were at the time out of work.</p>
  <p>" There can, I apprehend, be little doubt that this school
is a source of usefulness: there can, I should think, be as
little, that in this and other parishes in which the poorer
parts of the population are congregated, there must be many
children still in want of places of refuge and instruction such
as this, to which they can have recourse without payment,
where the sorriest garb and exterior will not find itself in a
position of painful contrast; where the treatment will be
kind and considerate, and the instruction, though humble,
yet sensibly conducted, in a manner to draw forth the
faculties hitherto lying dormant through neglect, and to call
into action right feelings and affections which mismanage-
ment or harshness may have repressed. The success of the
experiment, in this instance, has shown itself in the
improved habits of some of these children; in the pleasure
signified by others at finding total ignorance superseded by
some gleams of knowledge; in gratitude to their benefactors;





<pb id="p.36" n="36"/>

in growing self-respect, which manifests itself in attention
to the precepts and suggestions of the master, on behalf of
cleanliness and propriety even of the poorest dress. The
school was formed, not without much personal exertion, by
a paid agent and others representing to parents, too ignorant,
perhaps, or too regardless to make a voluntary effort, the
duty and the benefit of giving their children the opportunity
of obtaining some religious and useful instruction. Having so
far secured their confidence, and formed, as it were, this
nucleus, the influential persons who commenced the work on
behalf of their poorer fellow-parishioners, are now desirous
of extending it by providing a proper building; and as at
the period of my visit they made known to me their intention
of applying to the Committee of Council for aid, I have
given these details as material for their Lordships' con-
sideration."

city of palaces, of magnificent squares, and regal terraces;
that it is the chosen seat of opulence, grandeur, and refine-

of other and less favoured sections of the metropolis. The
error is not in associating with <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> much of the
grandeur and splendour of the capital, but in entirely dis-
sociating it in idea from the darker phases of metropolitan
life. As the brightest lights cast the deepest shadows, so
are the splendours and luxuries of the <placeName key="West-end">West-end</placeName> found in
juxta-position with the most deplorable manifestations of




<pb id="p.37" n="37"/>

human wretchedness and depravity. There is no part of
the metropolis which presents a more chequered aspect, both
physical and moral, than <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>. The most lordly
streets are frequently but a mask for the squalid districts
which lie behind them, whilst spots consecrated to the most
hallowed of purposes are begirt by scenes of indescribable
infamy and pollution; the blackest tide of moral turpitude
that flows in the capital rolls its filthy wavelets up to the
very walls of <placeName key="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</placeName>; and the law-makers for
one-seventh of the human race sit, night after night, in deli-
beration, in the immediate vicinity of the most notorious haunt
of law-breakers in the Empire. There is no district in London
more filthy and disgusting, more steeped in villany and guilt,
than that on which every morning's sun casts the sombre
shadows of the Abbey, mingled, as they soon will be, with
those of the gorgeous towers of the new ' <placeName key="Palace at West-

From some of these, narrow covered passage-ways lead into
small quadrangular courts, containing but a few crazy,
tumble-down-looking houses, and inhabited by characters of
the most equivocal description. The district, which is small
in area, is one of the most populous in London, almost every
house being crowded with numerous families and multitudes
of lodgers. There are other parts of the town as filthy,
dingy, and forbidding in appearance as this, but these are
generally the haunts more of poverty than crime.   But
there are none in which guilt of all kinds and degrees con-
verges in such volume as on this, the moral plague-spot, not
only of the metropolis, but also of the kingdom. And yet

from almost every point of it you can observe the towers of
the Abbey peering down upon you, as if they were curious
to observe that to which they seem to be indifferent.</p>
  <p>" Such is the spot which true Christian benevolence has,
for some time, marked as a chosen field for its most unosten-
tatious operations. It was first taken possession of, with a
view to its improvement, by the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName>, a
body represented in the district by a single missionary, who
has now been for about 12 years labouring-and not with-
out success-in the arduous work of its purification; and
who, by his energy, tact, and perseverance, has acquired
such an influence over its turbulent and lawless population,
as makes him a safer escort to the stranger desirous of visit-
ing it, than a whole posse of police.<note place="foot" n="1">The number of missionaries of that Society now located in West-

opulent philanthropists whom he has interested in his labours,
he has reared up within the district 2 schools, which are
numerously attended by the squalid children of the neigh-

which has recently been attached to the <orgName key="Ragged School

  <p>To meet such applicants the missionary took them under
his own care, provided them with board and lodgings, and






<pb id="p.39" n="39"/>

at the sime time had them placed under daily instruction.
After such cases had given evidence of a moral change, to
remove them entirely from the influence of old companions,
at their own request, they were assisted to emigrate. Of
this class the missionary has for a number of years been the
means of benefiting, on an average, about 30 annually.</p>

  <p><persName key="Dickens, Charles">Mr. Dickens</persName> thus narrates two interesting cases of emi-
grants from this school:-</p>
  <p>"It is encouraging to know that the most favourable
accounts have been received from emigrants who left the
Pear-street School. It is now some time since a lad, who,
although only 14, was taken into the latter, was sent to





<pb id="p.41" n="41"/>

<placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>. He had been badly brought up; his mother,
during his boyhood, having frequently sent him out, either
to beg or to steal. About a year after her son's departure,
she called, in a state of deep distress, upon the missionary of
the district, and informed him that her scanty furniture was
about to be seized for rent, asking him at the same time for
advice. He told her that he had none to give her, but to go
and pay the rent, at the same time handing her a sovereign.
She received it hesitatingly, doubting, for a moment, the
evidence of her senses. She went and paid the rent, which
was l8s., and afterwards returned with the change, which
she tendered to the missionary with her heartfelt thanks.
He told her to keep the balance, as the sovereign was her
own-informing her, at the same time, that it had been sent
her by her son, and had that very morning so opportunely
come to hand, together with a letter, which he afterwards
read to her. The poor woman for a moment or two looked
stupefied and incredulous, after which she sank upon a chair,
and wept long and bitterly. The contrast between her son's
behaviour and her own conduct towards him, filled her with
shame and remorse. She is now preparing to follow him to
<placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>.</p>
  <p>"Another case was that of a young man, over 20 years of
age, who had likewise been admitted, under special circum-
stances, to the same Institution. He had been abandoned
by his parents in his early youth, and had taken to the
streets to avert the miseries of destitution. He soon became
expert in the art of picking pockets, on one occasion depriv-
ing a person in <placeName key="Cornhill">Cornhill</placeName> of no less than 1501. in bank notes.
With this, the largest booty he had ever made, he repaired
to a house in the neighbourhood, where stolen property was
received. Into the room into which he was shown, a gloved
hand was projected, through an aperture in the wall, from
an adjoining room, into which he placed the notes. The





<pb id="p.42" n="42"/>

hand was then withdrawn, and immediately afterwards pro-
jected again with 20 sovereigns, which was the amount he
received for the notes. He immediately repaired to West-
minster, and invested 101. of this sum in counterfeit money,
at a house not a stone's-throw from the Institution.</p>
  <p>"For the 101. he received, in bad money, what represented
501. With this he sallied forth into the country with the
design of passing it off-a process known amongst the craft
as ' shuffle-pitching.' The first place he went to was <placeName key="North-
ampton">North-
ampton</placeName>, and the means he generally adopted for passing off
the base coin was this:-Having first buried in the neigh-
bourhood of the town all the good end bad money in his
possession, with the exception of a sovereign of each, so that,
if detected in passing a bad one, no more bad money would
be found upon his person, he would enter a retail shop, say
a draper's, at a late hour of the evening, and say that his
master had sent him for some article of small value, such as
a handkerchief. On its being shown him, he would demand
the price of it, and make up his mind to take it; whereupon
he would lay down a good sovereign, which the shopman
would take up, but, as he was about to give him change, a
doubt would suddenly arise in his mind as to whether his
master would give the price asked for the article. He would
then demand the sovereign back, with a view to going and
consulting his master, promising, at the same time, to be
back again in a few minutes. Back again he would come,
and say that his master was willing to give the price, or that
he wished the article at a lower figure. He took care, how-
ever, that a bargain was concluded between him and the
shopkeeper; whereupon he would again lay down the sove-
reign, which, however, on this occasion, was the bad and
not the good one. The unsuspecting shopkeeper would give
him the change, and he would leave with the property and
the good money. Such is the process of 'shuffle-pitching.'




<pb id="p.43" n="43"/>

In the majority of instances he succeeded, but was sometimes
detected. In this way he took the circuit twice of Great
Britain and <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>; stealing as he went along, and passing
off the bad money, which he received, for good. There are
few gaols in the United Kingdom of which he has not been
a denizen. His 2 circuits took him 9 years to perform, his
progress being frequently arrested by the interposition of
justice. It was at the end of his second journey that he
applied for admission to the <orgName key="Pear-street School">Pear-street
School</orgName>. He had
been too often in gaol not to be able to read; but he could
neither write nor cipher when he was taken in. He soon
learnt, however, to do both; and, after about 7 months'
probation, emigrated to <placeName key="America">America</placeName> from his own choice. The
missionary of the district accompanied him on board as he
was about to sail. The poor lad wept like a child when
he took leave of his benefactor, assuring him that he never
knew the comforts of a home until he entered the <orgName key="Pear-street School">Pear-street
School</orgName>. Several letters have been received from him since
his landing, and he is now busily employed, and-doing
well!</p>
  <p>" Instances of this kind might be multiplied, if necessary,
of what is thus being done daily and unostentatiously for the
reclamation of the penitent offender, not only after conviction,
but also before he undergoes the terrible ordeal of correction
and a gaol."</p>
  <p>The youth last referred to has been for the last 5 years
foreman in a saw-mill. The missionary has sent out to him
several young men, all of whom   he has provided with
employment, and has looked after not only their temporal
but also their spiritual welfare. He is a communicant at
a Baptist chapel. In a letter received from him lately, he
states that he has married a young woman, who is also a
communicant at the same chapel; and they are, to use his
own expression, as happy "as poor sinners can be out of





<pb id="p.44" n="44"/>

heaven." And yet this youth was brought up in a training-
school for young thieves, kept by a most notorious fellow,
who was proprietor of a lodging-house in<placeName key=" Spitalfields"> Spitalfields</placeName>, and
who was tried some years since at the <placeName key="Old Bailey">Old Bailey</placeName> for murder.
In a quarrel with his wife, as she was called, he took their
child to an upstairs room, with a knife cut off the child's
head, laid the head on a table, came down and told his wife,
if she would go up, she would find something belonging to
her lying on the table. She went up, and found the child's
head.</p>
 <p> A second pupil of this wretched man's is now undergoing
the missionary's reformatory training.
  In the magazine of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName>, for
<date value="1843-09">September, 1843</date>. it was added:-</p>
  <p>"Perhaps the most striking testimony to the value of this
Institution was borne a few days since, by 3 thieves, to the
missionary who was honoured in the establishment of the
school. One thief said to him, ' Why, Sir, you take all our
boys away.'  The second said, 'A  very good thing too.
And the third added, that the school was the greatest
blessing in the neighbourhood for the children, and that,
if he had any children, he would send them there too."</p>
  <p>The present number of children in these schools is large.</p>

demolition to make way for the new street about to be made

was expressed that such places could so long have existed

a distance of one of its leading public thoroughfares, and
been notoriously used for the worst of purposes.</p>

property, and harbouring thieves. The dilapidated buildings
behind were used as stables, where the fleetest horses were
kept in constant readiness for pursuit or speedy flight. From
all accounts it appears that these houses have ever been the
resort of the most notorious and abandoned individuals of the
metropolis. The names of their inhabitants stand conspicuous

for robbery and murder. In the shop No. 3, there were 2
traps in the floor, one for the concealment of property, the
other for a means of escape in case the felon should be
pursued. His method of escape was by lifting a covering
of wood about 3 feet square, when he immediately was in

readiness, across <placeName key="the Fleet Ditch">the Fleet Ditch</placeName>, and drawing it over after

   <p>" The cellar was a most filthy dismal place. Its light
emanated from a small window or hole immediately above
the Fleet Ditch. In one corner was a cell or den, made by
parting off a portion of the cellar with brickwork, well
besmeared with soot and dirt to prevent detection.   It
measured about 4 feet by 8. Here a chimney-sweep, who
escaped from the prison of Newgate a few years since, was
concealed for a considerable period, and fed through an
aperture made by removing a brick near the rafters.
Although repeatedly searched for he remained safe till
informed of by one of his associates.</p>
  <p>" In a corner on the opposite side were the brickwork
remains of a small blast furnace, which was used some years
since by a gang of coiners. A private still was long worked
successfully in this dismal place, till at length it was dis-
covered.</p>
  <p>" The most extraordinary and ingenious part of the pre-
mises I consider to be the means of escape. If a prisoner
once got within their walls, it was almost an impossibility
for his pursuers to take him, in consequence of the various
outlets and communications. There was scarcely a chance
for the most active officer to take a thief, if he only got a
few yards in advance of him. He had 4 ways of escape.
The staircase was very peculiar, scarcely to be described,
for though the pursuer and the pursued might only be a few
feet distant, the one would escape to the roof of the house,




<pb id="p.47" n="47"/>

while the other would be descending steps, and in a moment
or two would find himself in the room he had just left, by
another door. This was managed by a pivoted panel being
turned between the two. A large room on the first-floor back
is said to be the place where the abandoned inmates held
their nightly orgies, and planned their future robberies.
From the upper room there were means of escape by an
aperture being made in the wall leading to the house No. 2,
containing no less than 24 rooms, with 4 distinct staircases.
Here, also, level with the floor, was a shoot, or spout which
remained covered, except when required, about 2 feet in
breadth, and 3 feet in length, by which goods could be
conveyed to the cellar in an instant.</p>
  <p>" In short, a more suitable place for theft and murder
could scarcely be made, as the premises from bottom to top
evidently showed.</p>
 <p> " Immediately behind the premises just described stood a
dilapidated building, lately used as ' penny lodgings,' where
men and women slept promiscuously. Scenes commonly
occurred here, and in the court adjoining, far too gross and
revolting to be described. What has been actually seen by
one of the general superintendents of the Mission in the
middle of the day in the public street, before this house, is
so bad as actually not to be credited, except it were thus
confirmed.</p>
<p>  "In these lodgings your missionary found the associate of
Good, who was executed for the murder of <persName key="Jones, Jane">Jane Jones</persName>, about
2 years since. Indeed they were a receptacle for the most
abandoned, so that every session some of their inhabitants
were before the justice.</p>

<p>  The missionary who founded this school thus reports the
formation :-</p>
<p>  " The district of Field-lane, in the year <date value="">1841</date>, presented
one of the most deplorable and wretched spots in the metro-
polis. It consisted of numerous courts and alleys, inhabited
entirely by the most abandoned and dangerous classes.
Being determined to get to the root of the evil, I procured
the use of a small back room, in a court in <placeName key="Saffron-hill">Saffron-hill</placeName>, on a
first floor, occupied by a Roman Catholic, for the sum of
2s. each time we met. The court led into another court,
densely populated. Having intimated to those who sat on
the ground playing cards, that there would be a school
opened on Sunday, and having invited their attendance,
they laughed, and said I should get killed, and that then the
first would be the last day of it. Nothing daunted, however,
I proceeded to the place alone, on the first Sunday in
November, 1841.   As soon as I entered the court, the
shouts and yells began, amidst cries of, ' Here he comes-
here he comes-curse the Protestant crew!' &amp;c.  When
I reached the door, it was completely besieged, so many




<pb id="p.49" n="49"/>

were seeking admittance; and on the room being opened, it
was filled. Having no seats, we had to sit on the floor, and
the windows opened on the uncovered Fleet Ditch and the
knacker's-yard. Silence being procured, we attempted to
sing part of the Hundredth Psalm, but so discordant a choir
could scarcely be found. When addressed on the love of
<persName key="Christ">Christ</persName> to fallen man, they listened as if it was to them
entirely a new tale. The group consisted of 45, varying in
age from 6 to 18 years; and on being questioned, I found
41 of them prayed to the Virgin Mary, and 1 was a Jewess.</p>
  <p>' The second day the room was again soon filled, while
numbers sought admittance in vain. On this occasion I was
much annoyed by a young man who had been liberated from
Newgate the day before, where he had been sent for theft.
When we attempted to sing, he jumped and danced 'Jim
Crow.' Though told to desist, or leave the room, he would
not, and challenged me to touch him.  Being unable to
proceed, I put him outside; but scarcely had I returned,
when I beheld him rushing towards me with a large table-
knife in his hand. I grasped him by the arms, and held him
till a female pulled the deadly weapon from his hands, as he
cried, ' I'll stick you, you Protestant,' &amp;c.; and others
answered, ' Oh, the teacher !' ' The teacher will be mur-
dered!' At the close of the school, he was standing at the
door armed with stones, when he was spoken to in an
affectionate manner, but before I had gone many steps,
a stone was thrown, which passed within a few inches of my
head.</p>
  <p>"The next Sunday he returned, and conducted himself
orderly; and to my great surprise, on the following Sunday
he was accompanied by his father, a Roman Catholic, who
could not tell a letter. This youth continued to conduct
himself well, which gained him friends; and after being in






<pb id="p.50" n="50"/>

a gentleman's service several years, he was taken out to
Africa.</p>
   <p>"Desiring to extend my labours, a meeting for adults was
 opened one night in the week, which was continued amidst
 great annoyance from without; for so very dreadful was the
 place, I could not prevail on any one to help me. One
 evening, coming down the court, accompanied by a female,
 who carried some articles of clothing for the most destitute,
 a stone was thrown, which struck her on the head, rendering
 her insensible for some moments, and leaving a protuberance
 which was frequently accompanied with pain, until her
 death, several years after.</p>
   <p>"The landlady, taking advantage of the annoyance,
 doubled the rent, so I was obliged to seek another place,
 which was procured in White's-yard, Saffron-hill, on the
 ground floor; but, after some weeks, we were compelled to
 adjourn to the second floor, so great was the annoyance.
 "Now for the first time friends presented themselves
 willing to help in the great work; and in order to procure
 funds, cards were issued, to be produced monthly, each card
 being valued at one shilling, and supposed to be collected
 from twelve persons.</p>
<p> " Having procured more eligible premises in West-street,
 the teachers resolved to advertise in the ' Times' newspaper
 for assistance; and, in order to attract attention, it was
 agreed to head the advertisement, <orgName key="Ragged School">'Ragged School</orgName>,' and
 copies were attached to letters, and sent to many of the
 nobility and gentry.  The first answer was from  <persName key="Ashley, Lord">Lord

brought the school before the public, and many persons of
importance called to see for themselves."</p>

  <p>"I find it perplexing to reckon how many years have
passed since I traversed these byways one night before they
were laid bare, to find out the first <orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName>.</p>
  <p>"I found my first <orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName>, in an obscure place
called <placeName key="West-street">West-street</placeName>, <placeName key="Saffron-hill">Saffron-hill</placeName>, pitifully struggling for life,
under every disadvantage. It had no means-it had no
suitable rooms-it derived no power or protection from
being recognised by any authority; it attracted within
its wretched walls a fluctuating swarm of faces-young
in years but youthful in nothing else-that scowled Hope
out of countenance. It was held in a low-roofed den, in a
sickening atmosphere, in the midst of taint, and dirt, and
pestilence; with all the deadly sins let loose, howling and
shrieking at the doors. Zeal did not supply the place of
method and training; the teachers knew little of their
office; the pupils, with an evil sharpness, found them out,
got the better of them, derided them, made blasphemous
answers to scriptural questions, sang, fought, danced, robbed
each other-seemed possessed by legions of devils.  The
place was stormed and carried, over and over again; the
lights were blown out, the books strewn in the gutters, and
the female scholars carried off triumphantly to their old
wickedness. With no strength in it but its purpose, the
school stood it all out, and made its way.</p>
 <p> " Some two years since, I found it, one of many such, in a
large convenient loft in this transition part of Farringdon-
                            E 2





<pb id="p.52" n="52"/>

street-quiet and orderly, full, lighted with gas, well white-
washed, numerously attended, and thorougly established..</p>
  <p>"I found the school in the same place, still advancing. It
was now an <orgName key="Industrial School">Industrial School</orgName>, too; and besides the men and
boys who were learning-some, aptly enough; some, with
painful difficulty; some, sluggishly and wearily; some, not
at all-to read and write and cipher; there were 2 groups,
one of shoemakers, and one (in a gallery) of tailors, working
with great industry and satisfaction.  Each was taught and
superintended by a regular workman engaged for the purpose,
who delivered out the necessary means and implements. All
were employed in mending, either their own dilapidated
clothes or shoes, or the dilapidated clothes or shoes of some
of the other pupils. They were of all ages, from young boys
to old men. They were quiet, and intent upon their work.
Some of them were almost as unused to it, as I should have
shown myself to be if I had tried my hand, but all were
deeply interested and profoundly anxious to do it somehow
or other. They presented a very remarkable instance of the
general desire there is, after all, even in the vagabond breast,
to know something useful. One man, when he had mended
his own scrap of a coat, drew it on with such an air of
satisfaction, and put himself to so much inconvenience to
look at the elbow he had darned, that I thought a new coat
(and the mind could not imagine a period when that coat of
his was new !) would not have pleased him better. In the
other part of the school, where each class was partitioned off
by screens adjusted like the boxes in a coffee-room, was some
very good writing, and some singing of the multiplication
table -the latter on a principle much too juvenile and inno-
cent for some of the singers. There was also a ciphering-
class, where a young pupil-teacher had written a legible sum
in compound addition, on a broken slate, and was walking





<pb id="p.53" n="53"/>

backward and forward before it, as he worked it for the
instruction of his class.  *  *</p>
   <p>"The best and most spirited teacher was a young man,
himself reclaimed through the agency of this school from the
lowest depths of misery and debasement, whom the Committee
were about to send out to <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>. He appeared quite to
deserve the interest they took in him, and his appearance
and manner were a strong testimony to the merits of the
establishment.</p>
  <p>" I had scarcely made the round, when a moving of feet
overhead announced that the school was breaking up for the
night. It was succeeded by profound silence, and then by a
hymn, sung in a subdued tone, and in very good time and
tune, by the learners we had lately seen. Separated from
their miserable bodies, the effect of their voices, united in
this strain, was infinitely solemn. It was as if their souls
were singing-as if the outward differences that parted us
had fallen away, and the time was come when all the per-
verted good that was in them, or that ever might have been
in them, arose imploringly to heaven. ...</p>
  <p>" I do not hesitate to say-why should I, for I know it to
be true ?-that an annual sum of money, contemptible in
amount as compared with any charges upon any list, freely
granted in behalf of these schools, and shackled with no
preposterous red-tape conditions, would relieve the prisons,
diminish county rates, clear loads of shame and guilt out of
the streets, recruit the army and navy, waft to new countries
fleets full of useful labour, for which their inhabitants would
be thankful and beholden to us. It is no depreciation of the
devoted people whom I found presiding here, to add, that
with such assistance as a trained knowledge of the business
of instruction, and a sound system adjusted to the peculiar
difficulties and conditions of this sphere of action, their
usefulness could be increased fifty-fold in a few months."

  <p>About the same time the following narrative of a visit to

drawn up by a gentleman connected with the journal, who
was led to explore the place:-</p>
  <p>"' A <orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName>,' quoth the reader, 'pray, what kind
of school is that ?' A few words will suffice to answer this
inquiry. A <orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName> is a Sunday-school established
by private benevolence in a City district of the meanest kind,
where every house is worn-out and crazy, and almost every
tenant a beggar, or, perhaps, something worse. A school,
moreover, in which no children are to be found who would
be admitted into any other school; for, ragged, diseased,
and crime-worn, their very appearance would scare away the
children of well-conducted parents; and hence, if they were
not educated there, they would receive no education at all.</p>
 <p> "In London there exist several <orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School:</orgName> one
situated in the very heart of <placeName key="St. Giles's">St. Giles's</placeName>, another-the one

of the parents, who considered the reformation of their off-

varying in age from 6 to 18, were induced to attend the
school.  At present the average attendance on Sundays
exceeds 100. The school is also opened 3 times a week,
when instruction of an ordinary kind is imparted gratuitously

by a lady. Most-we might say all-of the fathers of the
schulars belong to what may be called the predacious class,
and the mothers fallen characters, who bear deep traces of
guilt and disease in their countenances. Many of the chil-
dren have been incarcerated for felony-educated thereto by
their parents, as the trade whereby they are to live; and the
destiny of all, unless better principles shall be implanted at
school than can be acquired at home, is the hulks or Norfolk
Island. All honour, then, to the brave men and women who
have consecrated the day of rest to the godlike task of
rescuing their fellow-creatures from a life of shame and
misery-to change the ruffian into an honest man!</p>
  <p>"<orgName key="The Smithfield ' Ragged School">The Smithfield ' Ragged School</orgName>' is situate at 65, West-
street, a locality where vice and fever hold fearful sway. To
open it in any other neighbourhood, would be to defeat the
object of the projectors. The very habiliments of the boys,
so patched, that the character of the original texture could
scarcely be gleaned, would almost be sufficient to preclude
their ingress to a more respectable neighbourhood, and make
them slink back abashed into their loathsome dens. It
follows, that the object of the promoters of the '<orgName key="Ragged
School">Ragged
School</orgName>'-the in-gathering of the outcasts-requires that it
should be held amidst the homes of these outcasts. The house
has that battered, worn aspect, which speaks of dissolute
idleness, the windows are dark and dingy, and the street too
narrow to admit a current of fresh air; and it needed, on the
rainy day in March in which it was visited, but a slightly
active imagination to call up visions of the robberies and
murders which have been planned in it, and of which it has
been the scene.</p>
  <p>"The entrance to the school was dark; and there being
no windows to illuminate the rickety staircase, we stumbled
into the school-room on the first-floor before we were aware.
On entering, the eye was greeted by a spectacle to which,




<pb id="p.56" n="56"/>

from its mingled humour and pathos, the pencil of Hogarth
could have alone done justice. We found a group of from
40 to 50 girls in one room, and about 60 boys in another;
the girls, although the offspring of thieves, quiet, winning,
and maidenly; but the boys full of grimace and antics, and,
by jest and cunning glances, evincing that they thought the
idea of attending school fine fun. Foremost amongst them
was a boy apparently aged 17, but as self-collected as a man
of forty, of enormous head, and with a physiognomy in
which cunning and wit were equally blended, whose mastery
over the other boys was attested by their all addressing him
as 'captain.' The boys had their wan, vice-worn faces as
clean as could be expected, and their rags seemed furbished
up for the occasion; whilst their ready repartee, and striking
original remarks, and the electric light of the eye, when
some peculiar practical joke was perpetrated, evinced that
intellect was there, however uncultivated or misused. Unless
we are greatly self-deceived, we beheld in this unpromising
assemblage as good a show of heads as we have ever seen in
any other Sunday-school, and the remark is justified by
what we learned with respect to the shrewdness generally
evinced by these children. The predominant temperament
was the sanguine, a constitution which usually indicates
great love for animal exercise; and, during the time we
were present, they appeared as if they could not sit quiet
one moment-hands, feet, head, nay, the very trunk itself,
seemed perpetually struggling to do something, and that
something generally being found in sheer mischief.</p>
  <p>"Hymns were occasionally sung to lively measures, the
girls singing with a sweetness and pathos that sunk deep
into the heart; but the boys were continually grimacing and
joking, yet all the time attempting to look grave and sober,
as if they were paying the most respectful attention. When
the superintendent told the boys that he was about to pitch





<pb id="p.57" n="57"/>

the tune, and that they must follow him, the boy before
mentioned as the captain cried out in a stage-whisper, ' Mr.
   says we are to follow him; I wonder where he's going
to?' a jest hailed with a general laugh by his confederates.
During teaching, questions of an unanswerable character
were submitted by the boys to their master; for example,
'If you were starving and hungry, wouldn't you steal?'
'What is the use of hanging <persName key="Tapping">Tapping</persName>; will that convert
him?'<note place="foot" n="2"> On the day of the visit <persName key="Tapping">Tapping</persName> was to be executed on the
morrow.</note>   Various other attempts were made by the captain
to puzzle the teacher, and failing, he was heard to say,
'That's no go-he is too deep for us.'</p>
  <p>" Amongst these boys, however, were some to whom the
word of kindness was evidently a ' word in season,' and who
drank in the tender accents with which they were addressed
-perchance for the first time-as if it were music to their
souls. Then, again, was to be seen some poor puny lad, as
gentle in mind as in body, who was obviously dying from
unfitness to cope with the requirements of his circumstances
-poor tender saplings, growing in an atmosphere which was
too bleak for any but the forest oak to brave. Untrained,
except to crime, as most of the children are, much good has
already been effected. Most of the scholars can read, and
books have been supplied suited to their circumstances; and
that the books are read with the understanding, is proved by
the questions submitted to their teachers. Due honour to
their parents has been taught. Many have thus become a
comfort to homes to which they had hitherto been an addi-
tional curse; and many a mother, herself regenerated through
the prattle of her child, has declared, with streaming eyes,
'I thank God my girl ever went to school !' Some of the
scholars have been partially clad by the <orgName key="Dorcas Society">Dorcas Society</orgName> con-
nected with the school; and the stress which has been laid





<pb id="p.58" n="58"/>
upon personal cleanliness has served to educe proper feelings
of self-esteem; no slight ingredient in civilization. Not-
withstanding their many eccentricities, the children are
really attached to their teachers; the girls coming forward
from natural impulse, and with true politeness giving an
affectionate ' Good-bye, Teacher,' even to the visitor; and the
boys, ever striving to please, in spite of their prevailing love
of fun. One outre, but characteristic instance, of this affec-
tion for their teachers may be noticed. A teacher, in passing
through <placeName key="Field-lane">Field-lane</placeName>, was attracted by a pugilistic contest;
when, on remonstrating with them on their folly, one of the
most brutal came up to him in a fighting attitude. Suddenly
a boy rushed through the crowd, and cried, in stentorian
tones, ' You leave him alone, Bill, or I'll knock you down;
don't you know that's my teacher?' If, then, to win the
affections be the best prelude to the reformation of the
debased, again we say, honour to those brave men and
women who, despite the contempt and the slander of the
Pharisee and the worldling, have not shrunk from trying to
rescue from ruin the neglected youthful soul!</p>
  <p>"Our sketch ends here; but the '<orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName>' was

  <p> The great numbers of wretched children who applied for
admission into the School beyond what it could contain, led
to the erection of new and spacious rooms, capable of
accommodating 500 children, which were opened in 1848,
six years after the previous school had been established.
The present average attendance is on Sunday, in the morn-
ing 110, in the afternoon 200, and in the evening, 400 : with
a staff of 58 voluntary teachers. In the week, the daily

instruction. <persName key="Ashley, Lord">Lord Ashley</persName> hearing of it, with his accustomed

contributed bread, left-off clothes, mattresses, &#x0026;c. A small





<pb id="p.60" n="60"/>

house of four rooms in <placeName key="Fox and Knot-court">Fox and Knot-court</placeName> was shortly
afterwards taken, and fitted up as a dormitory. Concerning
50 of these poor creatures, it was ascertained that 33 had
lost both parents, 14 had only one parent, and 3 only had both
parents living; 23 had no shirt, 16 no shoes, and most
of them had their clothes in a most tattered and filthy
condition. Some of them had not slept in a bed for five
weeks, others for five months, and a few, seldom for years.
At length, by the munificence of a benevolent lady, through
the <persName key="Shaftesbury, East of">Earl of Shaftesbury</persName>, the present Refuge was fitted up

   Review of the subsequent Progress of London <orgName key="Ragged Schools">Ragged Schools</orgName> to the present Time.</head>

  <p>The progress of <orgName key="Ragged Schools">Ragged Schools</orgName> has since been very
great. It is thus described by <persName key="Macgregor">Mr. Macgregor</persName>, in his recent
Lecture on " The Rise, Progress, and Results of Ragged
Schools," which the "<title>Ragged School Union Magazine </title>" very
truly describes as "the most complete summary of the
<orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName> movement that has yet been printed."</p>
   <p>This is rightly termed a 'movement.' Ignorance, and
its attendant, crime, had marched far, with a fearful start,
before us. We move to overtake it with knowledge and
religion ; limping, it may be, in the pursuit, but continually
onward. To halt would be shame and danger; it is a
movement which we dare not arrest.</p>
  <p>" In estimating the progress of this movement, we must
consider its numerical increase as well as its growing
efficiency . </p>
  <p>" At first <note place="foot" n="1"> I. e. When the <orgName key="Ragged School Union ">Ragged School Union </orgName>was formed, in <date value="1844">1844</date>.</note>there were only 20 schools thus linked
together in London; and successively, for each year, their
number has become 26, 44, 62, 82, 95, 102; and at present
there are 110.</p>
  <p>" So of teachers, 200 laboured voluntarily in these schools
to begin with; and they have increased annually to 250,
450, 822, 929, 1,392, 1,400, and 1,657 at the present time.
There are also 203 paid masters.</p>
  <p>" The children attending these schools have increased
from 2,000 in the first year, to 12,423 in <date value="1852">1852</date>." . .
</p>
                   </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Industrial Schools" id="c1s29"><head> Industrial Schools.</head>
  <p>"In fifty of our <orgName key="Ragged Schools">Ragged Schools</orgName> of London there are
Industrial Classes. The number of children employed in
these is about 2,000; but then example and influence are






<pb id="p.62" n="62"/>

extended through five times that number of scholars, and
generally they impart a healthy tone to the institutions
themselves,-not seldom to the neighbourhood around..</p>
  <p>"Boys are instructed by masters in tailoring and shoe-
making, making and mending the clothes of their school, or
the articles made are sometimes sold at low prices. Wood-
chopping is another employment in which many are engaged,
and the faggots thus prepared for firewood are bought
by those interested in the school.  Horse-hair picking,
strange to say, is a remunerative employment, probably
from the simplicity of the work, and the facility with
which it is directed.  Others are engaged in carpentry,
which is expensive and not advisable.   Mat-making is
better, and the fabrication of fishermen's nets. . . . There
is, in London, a small amount of ornamental work in leather
pocket-books, paper cases, and other articles, and the pro-
motion of this employment deserves further encouragement.
For the girls, sewing and knitting of all kinds form, as may
be supposed, their chief occupation in these classes.</p>
  <p>" What a hive is here, busy, cheerful, and orderly ! Surely
we may hope much from our industrial classes."

instruction, and employment for him, but as yet no home,
and oh, how hard it seems to turn him out into the streets!</p>
  <p>" Refuges then constitute the next feature, and money is
the great necessity for these. Our rate-payers grudgingly
disburse in our poor-houses ten times the sum which would,
if cheerfully and wisely expended, provide asylums of
Christian kindness for all our homeless little ones. The

moreover to a land of plenty, calling for their labour. . . In
most of these refuges deserving children are rescued wholly
from their bad companions, and the dens of their usual
habitation, the arches, doorways, and carts in which they
sleep. Books might be written of the histories of these

interest. All the appliances I have mentioned are required
to prepare the wandering and ignorant outcast for a respect-

that none should be sent out as colonists from our Ragged
Schools, unless they have proved by their conduct that they
are anxious to be industrious, and to maintain that character
which, I rejoice to say, our Ragged School emigrants have
acquired.</p>
  <p>" Private means supply, in some instances, the funds

  <p>The credit due to the <orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName> voluntary teachers
is very great. And it is a most gratifying circumstance to
know that there are 1,657 persons engaged in so arduous a
work throughout London.    But the Lord has greatly
rewarded them in the fruits which have resulted by His
blessing from their toils. <persName key="Adams, Sergeant">Mr. Sergeant Adams</persName> recently
expressed himself in the following terms on this subject:-</p>
  <p>"The enthusiasm   of teachers of <orgName key="Ragged Schools">Ragged Schools</orgName> is
marvellous. I have them  occasionally before me, to give
characters to boys who have been at their schools, and I thus
have practical opportunity of learning what they do. This
little anecdote may not be uninteresting. A female, some
time ago, came before me as a teacher of an Infant School.
She came to give a character to a boy who had been in the
school for 3 or 4 months.  I said, 'What do you know




<pb id="p.65" n="65"/>

 about this boy of 12 years of age. What has he to do with
 an <orgName key="Infant School ">Infant School </orgName>?'  'Oh,' said a person by her, 'my
 Lord, you are mistaken; she means that that is what she
 gets her living by, but she is a teacher also of a <orgName key="Ragged
 School">Ragged
 School</orgName>.' ' What! How many hours are you teacher of
 the <orgName key="Infant School ">Infant School </orgName>?'  From 9 in the morning till 5 in the
 afternoon.' 'Then what time have you for teaching the
 <orgName key="Ragged
 School">Ragged
 School</orgName>?' 'Oh, that does not begin till 7.' And
 the evenings of this woman, after the day had been spent in
 the wearisome occupation of managing these infants, was
 spent in voluntarily teaching these poor children. And I
 should say that, although perhaps that is a remarkable case,
 yet it is by no means an uncommon one; I never have a
 teacher of a <orgName key="Ragged
 School">Ragged
 School</orgName> before me without asking what
 his occupation is, and I find that their occupations are all of
 the same character, and that the whole that they do is
 carried out by the self-sacrifice of time and rest. That a
 system so supported must produce good effects sooner or
 later I have no doubt."</p>

                       Magazine.</title>"</head>
  <p>As illustrations of the benefits arising from these schools,
and the elevation of the wretched outcasts who are admitted
into them, the following three cases may be cited, referred
to in a single page of a Report recently presented by an
officer of the <orgName key="Ragged School Union">Ragged School Union</orgName>:-</p>
  <p>"A few weeks ago, on a dark wintry Sabbath evening,
we perambulated the east of London in quest of a small
<orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName>, the whereabouts of which was extremely
difficult to find. While groping our way through a succes-
sion of dark, dank, narrow courts and alleys, ploughing deep
furrows in the mire that intercepted the pathways, we halted
occasionally, and listened, hoping that the busy hum of the





<pb id="p.66" n="66"/>

school itself would direct our course. At length we found a
female guide, who conducted us to a small house, which we
had passed and repassed. Lifting up the latch, we were at
once introduced into a room about 9 feet square, filled with
children and youths of the true Ragged School stamp. They
were divided into 2 classes, and were being instructed by
2 decently dressed, and evidently zealous young men. The
order was excellent and the teaching good. But great was
our surprise when the secretary informed us, that when the
school was first opened, those very 2 young men were
admitted, and were among the rude and degraded class for
whose benefit the school had been established. They are the
fruit of the efforts here.</p>
  <p>"Visiting another school, more in the centre of London,
we saw a goodly number of scholars arranged in their classes,
with teachers drawn from circles the most respectable, and
all intent upon their duties. The superintendent conducted
us to one class in particular, where we observed a young
man at the head of a class of boys, commanding their utmost
attention. The superintendent whispered in the ear of one
of the visitors, ' Do you know him ?'  No,' was the reply.</p>
<p>' Do you not remember, when the school was opened, several
boys outside threw stones in at the windows, and one struck
the head of a boy, inflicting a severe wound?' 'Oh yes!
very well.' 'Well,' continued the superintendent, 'that
young man threw the stone. He subsequently came to the
school; after a long time, became reformed; the instruction
has been blessed to him temporally and spiritually; and now
he is yonder, one of our teachers.'</p>
  <p>"At another time we made our way to a crazy, small
house, down a narrow court near King's-cross. Here we
saw 12 lads busily employed sawing, chopping, tying, and
packing firewood. They were merry and happy as larks.
The master signalled, and in a second they formed a circle




<pb id="p.67" n="67"/>

around us. ' Well, my boys,' we asked, ' what makes you
look so sad?' ' Sad!' cried one, a sandy-headed, active
little fellow, some 11 years old, 'we aint sad.' 'No,' said
another, ' we are happy,' at the same time wiping the per-
spiration from his face with his jacket-sleeve. 'Happy!'
we reiterated, 'what makes you happy?' 'We learn here
to work for our living,' said a third, 'and we are not obliged
to thieve now. If we does our work, we gets our grub, and
a good night's lodging; and we goes to school at nights and
Sundays, and learns to read and write.' 'And is that all?'
' No,' answered another, ' teachers tell us the way to heaven.'
After a little more of such agreeable chit-chat, the master
signalled again, and with a speed truly astonishing they flew
to their posts and resumed their work, evidently priding
themselves on the skill they manifested in cleaving the wood
at a stroke, and striking within an eighth of an inch of their
fingers without touching them."</p>

  <p>The following case is reported to the author, in a letter
which he recently received from a clergyman, who is Incum-
bent of a large parish in London. It refers to a lad, only a
very short time since one of the ragged class, now training
to be a schoolmaster of a National School, to whom will be
entrusted the important charge of the teaching of the poor
children of a parish. How great the change between the
two positions of life ! And of this change, a <orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName>
was the instrumental cause:</p>
  <p>"Two years and a-half ago, a young man, aged 17, came
to our evening <orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName> for the first time. His regular
attendance, his evident desire to improve, and his intelligent
countenance, soon attracted our attention. We found that
he had never been to a day or Sunday-school, but that when
he was 14 years of age he went to an evening school for a






<pb id="p.68" n="68"/>

short time, where he felt no interest and learned very little.
But now, feeling a desire to learn to real and write, he
resolved to go to some evening <orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName>. While in
this state of mind, he saw one of our bills, headed, 'Evening
Classes for Young Men."   He was only able to read the
heading, and got his mother to read the rest.  Soon after
this, he came to the school. He had not been to a place
of worship for years, and spent all his evenings in low
theatres, concerts, &#x0026;c. At the school he improved wonder-
fully. He soon learnt to read, write, and cipher, well. In
the latter he was much interested, and so excelled that he
became wiser than his teachers. He had been regularly
attending the <orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName> 3 months, when he was pre-
vailed upon by the teachers to come to church on Sunday
evenings. He afterwards said, that he had no better motive
for coming than gratitude to myself and the teachers. There
the Word was blessed to his soul. He regularly attended
church morning and evening on Sunday, and on Wednesday
evening, and became quite a changed character. After he
had been with us a year, he was most desirous to become a
Sunday-school teacher in the <orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName>. He became a
very efficient teacher, was confirmed, and became a regular
communicant. All this time he was wretchedly poor, and
living with ungodly friends, but 'adorning the doctrine of

to the <orgName key="Metropolitan Training Institution for Schoolmasters">Metropolitan Training Institution for Schoolmasters</orgName>,
at Highbury. He has been there 4 months, has made great

<pb id="p.69" n="69"/>

extract from the "<title> London City Mission Magazine,</title>" of <date value="1848-07">July,
1848</date>:-</p>
 <p>  "February.-It has been my privilege during the past
month, to have met a number of young persons, once the
children of our first <orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName>, all of whom are now in
respectable situations."</p>
  <p>"March.-Seldom a week passes but some youths are
met with by me, who were among the first of our Ragged
School children, who have risen up in life, and have become
honest and industrious members of society."</p>
<p>  The following two cases of usefulness are specimens of
those benefits:</p>
  <p>" Case 1.-H. C. T. was the son of dissipated parents.
He had one brother, who had been transported, and a younger
brother, who was, at the time of his admission into school,
confined in prison, because he would rather steal than starve.
He became very much attached to school. For regular
attendance and good conduct he was rewarded with a pair of
new shoes and stockings-the first, he told us, that he ever had.
On returning to school, the following day, after the present,
he brought his shoes under his arm, in frost and snow, for
at the time the snow lay on the ground some inches. 'You
see, Sir,' he replied, ' my feet are all chilblains. I could not
bear them on, and I would not leave them at home, because
I should not be likely to see them again. My mother would
take them to my uncle's, and drink the money. You know,
Sir, my mother would have drunk me if I would go up the
spout!' The writer replied, ' C., I am sorry to know that
what you say is too true.' Often did this poor boy promise
that he would never do as his brothers had done. Ah, poor
boy ! he often suffered the greatest privations from the want
of food. After many shifts, he applied to the writer for the
loan of 3d., saying, at the same time, that he thought he
could make his own living, and attend school too. He was





<pb id="p.70" n="70"/>
furnished with 3d., and off he hastened and purchased one
dozen boxes of lucifers. So successful was he, that he
realized 3d. profit. Encouraged by his new undertaking, he
made up his mind to go out every morning with his dozen
boxes of lucifers, which he did for nearly 2 years, attending
school all day, and doing sufficient business at night to pro-
vide him with food during the next day. When he was
asked how he managed to live, ' Why, you know,' he replied,
'that I can always manage to make 3d., and sometimes more.
I spend one penny for breakfast, another for dinner, and the
same sum for supper: that's better than my brothers did;
and by and by, when I can read and write well, I will
get a situation.'</p>
  <p>" The good resolution of this neglected youth contrasts
strongly with the conduct of the parents, and is worthy of
all praise, and even of the imitation of some placed in better
circumstances, and enjoying higher advantages. What were
the impelling motives which led this boy to the adoption of
such a course? Was it the example of those to whom he
ought to have been able to look for protection and support ?
No; they were sunk into the vortex of intemperance, the
veriest slaves of the gin palace and the gin glass. Their
home was the deserted, cheerless home of emptiness, with the
exception of 2 cups, which stood on the mantel-shelf; an old
tin tea-kettle, without a cover, which stood on the fireless
grate; and a few shavings in the opposite corner of the room;
but without even a rag to cover them or their children during
their midnight repose. Fancy poor C. rising from such a bed
in the morning, taking an old rag to the back yard, where
stood the water-butt, to wash (for a drunkard could not afford
either soap or a wash-basin), to make himself somewhat
decent among his schoolfellows. Thus prepared, see him set
out to the cheap bread-shop, a few doors from the school-
room, to have his morning's meal, in the shape of three





<pb id="p.71" n="71"/>

farthings' worth of bread and one farthing's worth of drip-
ping; which, however, was to him as rich as the new-made
butter is to those who have not lucifers to sell before they
can have a breakfast.</p>
  <p>" It might be supposed that C. was the dull spiritless
youth, broken down by bad living and cruel treatment of
worthless parents; quite the reverse, he was the happy,
contented, spirited lad-the very life of the playmates with
whom he associated. He was always the first at school, and
never behind with his lessons, pushing onwards as if longing
for the time when he would be fit for the duties of life.</p>
  <p>" He had an only sister, who attended the same school, and
who was also very regular and punctual, though she suffered
for so doing from the wicked treatment of her mother. Poor
C. often shared his morsel of bread with her when there was
none at home for the poor girl; of the two, she was the
elder. The time at last arrived when our youth set out in
search of a situation. After much search he obtained one as
a fishmonger's errand-boy, at 4s. a week. Five years have
since passed away, and he is now the confidential servant of
his employer. He has ever looked upon his master's interests
as bound up with his own.</p>
  <p>" Some months after our young fishmonger entered his
situation his mother fell a victim to her passion for strong
drink. This event left some impression on the mind of her
dissipated husband, and, for a time, was a means of leading
him to abandon his evil propensities. So altered did he
become, that he moved from his wretched hovel-the scene
of many a drunken debauch-to a more comfortable abode,
which, by sobriety, he was enabled to furnish according to
his circumstances, and for upwards of 3 years his daughter
kept him and his home comfortable, until he again became
the victim of intemperance, returning to it like the sow that
was washed to her wallowing in the mire. He soon sold




<pb id="p.72" n="72"/>

every article of furniture he possessed, and turned his
daughter into the streets. He has become the inmate of a
wretched lodging-house, where he is now dragging out a
miserable existence. Happy was it for the poor girl that her
brother was the honest journeyman fishmonger, for he shared
his loaf with her, and paid her lodgings, until she obtained
the means of her own support, which she has long done by
honest industry, and may be seen every Sunday bending her
way, in company with her brother, to the house of prayer,
both attributing what they are to the blessing of God on the
instruction received at the <orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName> in the old stable.</p>
  <p>" Case 2.-From a wretched home were taken a son and
daughter to the schools, shortly after they were opened.
These 2 children were in such a state of filth and rags that
the first thing done with them was to have them cleaned and
scrubbed. So fearfully neglected did they appear to have
been, that more than ordinary attention was given to them.
On their return to their miserable home and parents, they
were scarcely known to be the same son and daughter, by
their worthless mother. The new pinafores and clean hands
and faces had wrought such a change that they even attracted
the notice of their neighbours. The mother soon found that
one of the rules of the school was cleanliness: however poor
and ragged might be the dress of the scholars, this important
appendage to health was looked after by the teacher. In this
family it wrought well, for the children would not go to
school until they had a good wash in the morning. This
was done by the mother, and it began to have some effect
upon her own person, for nothing looked more unseemly than
the appearance of her tattered gown and matted hair, which
at once told that she troubled herself very little with either
soap or water about her person. The children's comparatively
clean appearance engendered some respect for her own per-
sonal comfort, so that she began to apply both water and




<pb id="p.73" n="73"/>

soap, until it became a habit daily. Her dress, too, had the
benefit of the wash-tub. Her husband's shirt, also, had some
share of her attention. Their room floor, that did not appear
to have been washed for years, began in a few weeks to show
that the scrubbing-brush had been applied to it: in short,
the whole appearance of both room and family, in 3 months
after the children's admission into school, wore an aspect we
never saw before, both of cleanliness and comfort. The
children made progress in their lessons; they were never
absent from their class; the hymns and texts of Scripture
they were taught by their teacher were repeated over to
their parents when they went home; and they listened to
their children with much pleasure. The consequence was,
the father was induced to think more of his own fire-side
than he was wont to do; and the progress of his children
pleased him so much that he put away d. a-week to pur-
chase a Bible for each of them. The improvement wrought
in this family was not only observed by their neighbours,
but the landlord of the court was attracted by their new
habits, which led him to make the offer to them to let the
whole of the cottages in the court to their care. Arrange-
ments were entered into, and the father of this once wretched
and indifferent family became the landlord of the place, which
soon began to look comfortable and clean. The dust-heap
that lay in the centre was removed, and the first story of
each house-front was washed twice a-year; and so continued
for years, until death removed the father, and the mother
went to the country, to live with the son. He works as a
labourer in Surrey, while the sister still remains the honest
servant-girl, in a family at Chelsea."</p>

M'Gregor's evidence before the <orgName key="Committee of the House of Commons">Committee of the House of Commons</orgName>.</note>
  <p>The shoe-blacks now to be seen throughout the London
streets are a very interesting class, illustrative of the vast
benefit which may be conferred on individuals and on
society by well-directed voluntary Christian efforts. They
are employed by a Society, the Committee of which are
twelve barristers of the Temple or Lincoln's Inn, who
honourably devote much time and attention to a cause so
apparently humble. One of these gentlemen gave evidence
before a<orgName key=" Committee of the House of Commons"> Committee of the House of Commons</orgName> in <date value="1852">1852</date>, that,
in addition, he had been a Sunday-school teacher for the last
15 years, a member of the <orgName key="Committee of the Ragged School
Union">Committee of the Ragged School
Union</orgName> for 4 years, and that he had been in the habit of
visiting <orgName key="Ragged Schools">Ragged Schools</orgName> two or three times every week,
as well as on the Sundays. The boys employed have been
taken as nuisances from the streets, and as criminals from
the gaols-made useful servants to the public, able to earn
an honest livelihood during their reformation, and give
promise of becoming religious and respectable lads at home,
or useful colonists abroad. Of those engaged in the first
1 1/2 year, 27 had been criminals, and some of them had been
many times in gaol. They are from 12 to 16 years of age,
though not often so old as 16 now, as younger boys are
found preferable. They are more generally now about 12
or 13. During the <title>Exhibition of <date value="1851">1851</date></title>, the number of these
lads was increased to 36, but since then it has even
increased, and during the summer of <date value="1852">1852</date>, was 45. It






<pb id="p.75" n="75"/>

is supposed that there is room for the employment of 200 in
the great city.  They are all dressed in a red uniform,
provided by the Society, which has been found extremely
useful-to the boy, in enabling him to keep himself
separate from his former associates; to the Society, in
enabling them to find the boy and inspect his conduct; and
to the public, in showing them where the boy is stationed.
The stations occupied were applied for by the Society, and
allowed by the Police Commissioners.  They vary very
much in their value, and the lads are promoted from an
inferior station to a better one as a reward for good conduct,
or removed from a better to a worse station as a punishment
for bad conduct. The boys are all taken from the <orgName key="Ragged
Schools">Ragged
Schools</orgName>, and their reception is held out as a prize for merit.
It devolves on the superintendents of the 26 best <orgName key="Ragged
Schools">Ragged
Schools</orgName> to select the candidates, and from these the <orgName key="Com-
mittee of the Shoe-black Society">Com-
mittee of the Shoe-black Society</orgName> select a given number,
whom they consider most worthy of the distinction. Before
they are employed they have a week's training at the
Society's premises, No. 1, <placeName key="Off-alley">Off-alley</placeName>, <placeName key="George-court">George-court</placeName>, <placeName key="Strand">Strand</placeName>.
There they all assemble every morning before they proceed
to their respective stations, and prayers are conducted at
half-past 7 by one of the Committee, or, in his absence, by a
paid officer, who receives a salary of 641. a-year. Ten of
the boys sleep on these premises, which pays the rent of the
entire house; for the Society is made now entirely self-
supporting. The boys in general take their meals at their
posts, and return at 6 in the evening to pay in all the money
they have earned. On Wednesday evenings a lecture is
delivered to them on religious subjects. There are provided
for them a library, a savings-bank, and means for providing
bath-tickets. They attend their respective schools in the
evening, and a Sunday morning school is conducted for
their benefit by one of the Committee.  "Good-conduct





<pb id="p.76" n="76"/>

badges" are given by the Society as marks of merit; and
warning, suspension for a week, or discharge, as punish-
ments. Each boy is paid 6d. a-day. The remainder of his
earnings is divided into three parts, the first of which
is paid to the boy himself, the second is put by for him
in the savings-bank, and the third is given to the Society
to defray its expenses. A penny is the charge for brushing
a gentleman's shoes and cleaning his trousers.  Sometimes
2d., 3d., 4d., or even 6d., is given, but the Society desires to
discourage this excess of payment. About 800 pairs of
shoes were cleaned each day during the summer of <date value="1852">1852</date>.
During the first year the boys laid by for their future
welfare, in the savings-bank, <date value="1561">1561</date>. The earnings of course
much vary, according to the state of the weather, the traffic
of the station, and the quickness of the boy. It once reached
21. 2s. a-week by an Irish lad during the Exhibition. In
the summer, 10s. is a fair sum to earn. This, continued all
the year, with 45 boys, would amount to 1,4041.; but in the
winter months the earnings are reduced one-half.  The
boys have generally been found honestly to bring to the
office what they receive. As they are changed, the value of
each station is tolerably known. They are also inspected by
officers of the Society. If suspicion is excited, they are
watched. But only 2 cases of dishonesty were thus dis-
covered during the Society's first year. During that year,
of the 27 previous criminals, 3 were sent out by the Society,
as a reward, as emigrants, 5 obtained situations, 1 was
restored to his friends, 3 left of their own accord, 2 were
discharged for incompetence, 4 for misconduct, and 9
remained in the employment. All these had been convicted
as thieves. Of 29 other boys employed that year, whose
parents were convicts, or drunken and depraved, or had
abandoned their children, 4 emigrated, 6 obtained situations,
1 was apprenticed, I left of his own accord, 2 were dis-




<pb id="p.77" n="77"/>

charged for incompetence, 7 for misconduct, and 9 remained
in the employment. Of the first class-the thieves, a lad
was raised from the rank of a criminal to the rank of
inspector, and was paid 10s. a-week by the Society.
Another, who had been a burglar, and who entered on
his work with a bullet in his neck, received a similar
promotion. And a third, who, although so young, had been
30 times in custody, and 3 times in gaol, was proceeding
favourably. In one case, a lad received the reward of
emigration, who was the son of a transport, and who took
with him 151., which he had saved from his earnings. In
another case, a boy, who was without a father, had only
a drunken mother, and who was a criminal himself, obtained
a situation as in-door servant, and, on doing so, commenced
family prayers in the kitchen. He gave every satisfaction
to his employer. One of the best lads remaining has no
father; his mother is a criminal; and he himself had been
a criminal also.</p>
<p>  A remarkable circumstance is, that the Society has
received numerous applications from respectable parents
to employ their sons, who have apparently felt no objection
to their children associating with lads of so debased a class,
so satisfactory has been the general conduct of the latter.
The Society has refused, however, such applications, desiring
to limit the number of the lads to those who have passed
through <orgName key="Ragged Schools">Ragged Schools</orgName>.</p>
 <p> Another interesting circumstance is, that 25 of these
lads, although so young, actually supported their parents
by their earnings.</p>
  <p>It is also very interesting, that the lads are so fond
of their situations, that it is difficult to get them to leave
for more permanent ordinary places.  They will not go
for less than 7s. a-week, and they often show a desire to
return, after having left.</p>




<pb id="p.78" n="78"/>

  <p>Nor is it an unimportant circumstance, that the Society
has no need to seek after situations for the lads.  They
receive numerous applications for them. One omnibus com-
pany alone, during the year, applied for 40 lads.</p>
  <p>Similar Societies have also been formed in <placeName key="Dublin">Dublin</placeName>,
<placeName key="Liverpool">Liverpool</placeName>, and <placeName key="Sheffield">Sheffield</placeName>.</p>
  <p>The lads who have no homes, and who do not lodge
at the Society's house, live in model lodging-houses, and
the refuges connected with their schools. Those who lodge
in <placeName key="Off-alley">Off-alley</placeName> pay 3d. a night for their lodging.</p>
  <p>Emigration expenses have been met partly by the schools
to which the lads pertain, and partly by the <orgName key="Ragged School
Union">Ragged School
Union</orgName>. The outfit is in every case paid for out of the lad's
savings. None are sent out but those who really desire to
leave the country. In many cases they prefer remaining at
home.</p>
  <p>Arrangements are in progress for establishing a school
especially for these lads, and making them pay for it, which
they appear to be most ready to do.</p>
 <p> All the lads on the Sunday must attend either church or
school.</p>
  <p>A fine of Id. is levied for want of punctuality at prayers
in the morning, which is applied to a sick fund.</p>
  <p>The following advantages in the plans of the Society are
believed to have been most important in its success. By
them industry is not merely enforced, but immediately
rewarded; permanent employment is held out in prospect;
good and bad conduct are made directly apparent to the
other lads, and to the managers; emulation is promoted by
classification; honesty by constant money transactions, in
which trust is involved; economy by daily saving; attention
to respectability of appearance by enforcing proper clothing;
punctuality by fixed hours; steadiness by the requirement of
prolonged attention to duties at a certain post; learning by





 <pb id="p.79" n="79"/>

promotion to stations requiring it, and love of home by a
provision for those who would otherwise be without a
slelter.</p>

  <p> As during the winter months so many street shoe-blacks
cannot be profitably employed as in the summer, a portion
of them then become broomers. The shops in Regent-street
and Bond-street were canvassed, and to those whose owners
were willing to pay Id. a day, boys were sent during the
winter of <dateRange from="1851" to="1852">1851-2</dateRange>, to each of whom was entrusted the duty
of sweeping the pavement from morning to evening before
20 shops, and keeping it clean from dirt. Their earnings
about sufficed only for their support. This employment,
however, besides being far less lucrative, is much inferior in
its discipline. The whole sanitary condition of London
might be attended to by boys of this description. It might
be extended, almost indefinitely, if suitable persons would
devote time to its superintendence.  Broomers are now
established in <placeName key="York">York</placeName>, <placeName key="Brighton">Brighton</placeName>, and <placeName key="Gravesend">Gravesend</placeName>.

<p>  Another occupation in which boys of this description have
been employed by the same Society, is that of messengers.
<orgName key="The Electric Telegraph Company">The Electric Telegraph Company</orgName> have allowed two boys to

every subsequent half-mile. They are furnished with books
for their parcels, and are made responsible for a 'booked
parcel up to the amount of 31. In order to provide for the
last-mentioned requirements, those lads only are employed
by the Society in this work, who have money, which they

  <p>How much better is it to seek to prevent crime than to
have to punish it! The foregoing facts most strikingly
illustrate that truth. It is also far more economical. The
following comparison of the expenditure of prisons and
schools is most conclusive. It is by <persName key="Thomas Andrew">Andrew Thomson</persName>, Esq.,
of <placeName key="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</placeName>:-</p>
  <p>"The expense of all prisoners, old and young, in<placeName key=" Scotland"> Scotland</placeName>,
is about 16 guineas a-year, the expenses in England are
about 241., and both these sums are altogether independent
of the costly buildings in which they are lodged. The
expenses in a Scotch workhouse or union-house are generally
from 101. to 121. a-year, but in the industrial schools the
expense of training up a boy is about 31. los., after deduct-
ing the amount of his earnings. In the girls' school the
expense is much smaller. .  Now contrast that with the







<pb id="p.81" n="81"/>

expense of a prisoner, especially if he goes through the
usual career. A practised regular thief generally spends
about 3 years in prison before he is transported. His
3 years in prison cost from 601. to 701., and his expense of
transportation is variously stated, say from 1501. to 2501
Altogether it costs, say about 3001., before you have done
with him; and he is not better when you have done with
him, or very little better, than he is at the commencement.
Now, if you send him to an <placeName key="York Castle">York Castle</placeName>"><placeName key="York Castle">York Castle</placeName>, and keep him
there for 5 years, which is much more than the usual period
we are able to keep them, he would not have cost 201., and
he would have been put fairly in the way of getting a living.
He would have been thoroughly educated in the first
principles of religion, and the elements of reading, writing,
and arithmetic, and he would have been thoroughly taught
industrial habits, all of which can now be done for 201. in
the case of a boy, and for 141. in the case of a girl. Com-
pare this with the enormous expenditure in some of the
prisons in England; for instance, in <placeName key="Pentonville">Pentonville</placeName> and <placeName key="York Castle">York Castle</placeName>. In the latter, every prisoner sits in a house which
costs the public 601. a-year, for each cell in <placeName key="York Castle">York Castle</placeName>
cost 1,2001., so that each felon confined there, boy or girl,
pays a house rent of 601. a-year. Nay, the very walls that
surround <placeName key="York Castle">York Castle</placeName> cost an enormous sum of money,
above 100,0001., all of which was raised by voluntary
assessment on the county of York."</p>

               </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="The especial Claims of Girls" id="c1s41"><head>The especial Claims of Girls.</head>
 <p> It must not be, however, understood from    previous
observations that <orgName key="Ragged Schools">Ragged Schools</orgName> are only for boys. The
number of girls is as large. Fewer by far of these have
been, or are likely to be, in prison. But this is not because
they are more free from the sin of theft, although they are
probably not so adventurous in stealing large amounts. But






<pb id="p.82" n="82"/>

the public is more unwilling to prosecute girls than boys for
theft, under any circumstances. And the breach of the
eighth commandment with girls is so almost universally
associated with a breach of the seventh commandment also, that
the fear of exposure in the latter particular generally causes
those who are robbed to prefer with quietness to submit to
the loss.  If, however, the public welfare, so far as the
expense of punishment is concerned, is less interfered with
by criminal girls than by criminal boys, it is in other and
more important respects imperilled to a far greater extent.
<persName key="Carpenter, Mary">Miss Mary Carpenter</persName>, the authoress of "<title> Reformatory
Schools for the Children of the poor and destitute Classes,
and for Juvenile Offenders,</title>" who for the last 17 years has
devoted herself to this class, with a zeal which may put to
shame most of those whose zeal to their Redeemer professes
to be founded on a recognition of his essential Deity, has
observed on this subject:-</p>
<p>  "I greatly lament that there has not been as yet that
attention paid to the condition of girls which I think to be
exceedingly necessary, for although girls may be considered
altogether, as rather more virtuous than boys, if they are
kept out of temptation, yet when they do once fall into vice,
they are even more dangerous to society. It is, therefore,
very important that greater attention should be directed
than has hitherto been done to girls, especially when we
remember that they are to be the mothers of the next
generation. I have known numerous instances in which a
family has been well brought up, with a bad father and a
good mother, but I have NEVER known an instance of a
family being otherwise than vicious with a bad mother."</p>
<p>  Nor has less success attended the efforts made for ragged
girls. The same authoress states,-</p>
 <p> "In 'the perishing and dangerous class' girls are very
far sunk below boys.   Nevertheless, when we can get




                  <pb id="p.83" n="83"/>

 them under influence, and we have at times collected in the
 school some very miserable ragged girls, there has been a
 more striking and perceptible effect produced upon them in
 a short time than upon the boys. Therefore I believe that
 proper influences brought to bear upon them before they are
 fixed in sin would prove very efficient."
</p>
    </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Voluntary Effort, and that by the Masses, rather than Government Aid, to be especially rested on" id="c1s42"><head>Voluntary Effort, and that by the Masses, rather than
         Government Aid, to be especially rested on.</head>
  <p> The foregoing calculation of the comparative expenses of
 schools and prisons, makes no reference to the amount of loss
 to the more respectable portion of the community by the
 plunder of these juvenile thieves. That is a most consider-
 able item to add. It would be good political economy for
 the national funds to be appropriated to Reformatory Schools
 rather than to prisons.  Less national money would be
 expended, and the end desired would be far more effectually
 promoted. The day may probably arrive when this will be
 seen and acted on, as it is already by those undergoing
 sentences of imprisonment in the <orgName key="Reformatory Institution at
 Red Hill">Reformatory Institution at
 <placeName key="Red Hill">Red Hill</placeName></orgName>, near <placeName key="Reigate">Reigate</placeName>.</p>
<p>   But it is important for Christian persons not to lean
too much on governing powers. Their hands are ordinarily
very full, and there is very general disappointment ex-
perienced in hopes resting on legislative bodies. The great
dependance of the <orgName key="Church of Christ">Church of Christ</orgName> should be on her own
exertions. These will suffice, at all events, for such an
object as this, if she is only alive to her responsibilities.
And what is needed to be done, is likely to be done with far
more effect when it is done by voluntary effort, and from
affection to the work. This kindly feeling, exercised by
teachers, towards those who have only been accustomed to
harshness and severity, has, indeed, under God, been a main
cause of the success of the effort. The hearts of the poor






<pb id="p.84" n="84"/>

outcasts have first been won to the teachers, and then
to God.</p>
  <p> Nor is it desirable to depend too much on the volun-
tary aid of the higher classes.  To interest the great
masses of the population, and especially of the Christian
population, is by far the more important. This was illus-
trated in a striking manner in Aberdeen, where the work-
ing men of the city were so desirous that schools for the
destitute class should be set up, that they subscribed 2501. in
one sum, and presented it to the <title>Directors of the <placeName key="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</placeName>
Schools</title> for that purpose.</p>

  <p>It is to be hoped that this appointment, apart from its
indirect benefits, will tend to the extension of the Ragged
School system, until the whole number of the dangerous
and perilous class are brought under its salutary training.</p>
 <p> The same result will also, doubtless, be accelerated by
the constant increase in the number of City Missionaries,
Scripture-readers, and voluntary visitors of the poor, as well
as by the united efforts of the ministers of the Gospel.</p>

<p>    At present there are probably, at the very least, from

under instruction, supposing that the children now attending
<orgName key="Ragged Schools">Ragged Schools</orgName> are, as they should be, exclusively of the
class for which the schools were designed. How important
is it, then, that greater efforts should be made ! Ragged

of City Missionaries, nor would they be filled, if erected,
without some such agency to bring in the outcasts. There
is a very near proportion of the number of children yet

Union">Ragged School
Union</orgName>, as compared with the total number of that class,
and the number of poor brought under the visitation of the
<orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName>, as compared with the entire poor

therefore, leads to the extension of the other. The Union

work, blessing those who engage in it as well as those who
receive the more immediate benefit.

 saved a soul from vice and infamy, yet I refused.' Ye who
 have been remiss in duty, who have not cared when a
 brother erred and perished, awaken to new life, and be not
 slack in the performance of duty. It is not too late-scores
 may yet be saved by your judicious efforts, by your counsels,
 your tears, your affectionate hearts and open hands. A kiss
 is better than a blow. Kindliness is a moral lever, judiciously
 used, which will move the world and raise it to life, light,
 and joy." <note place="foot" n="2">" <orgName key="American Christian Advocate.">American Christian Advocate.</orgName>"</note>
 Let the reader especially reach forth a helping hand to
 this class. The souls of all are in one sense alike important.
 They are all endued with immortality, and that immortality
 will be either of bliss or woe. But, in another sense, this
 class is the most important of all to be saved. They are
 more an object of pity; they are by far the most dangerous
 and costly to society; and the power of the Gospel is
 the more honourably shown in their change. God is more
 glorified and man is more benefited by the deliverance of
 these outcasts than in other classes. Nor are they by
 any means, when other criminal and vicious classes are
 added to them, that minority of the population of the
 one half of London, which the other half, unacquainted
 intimately with the condition of these, are too much dis-
posed to imagine.</p>

  <p> "Both these retreats are splendid places; the former,
especially, is one of the most magnificent palaces in the
country, and yet their inmates are, for the most part, merely
private soldiers and sailors. It may be said that they are,
after all, but the abodes of persons of poor and low degree,
and that there is an unsuitableness in giving those a palace
to dwell in, whose mode of life in other respects is about on
a level with that of the inhabitants of cottages.  Thus
might those argue who looked to the matter with a reference
only to physical considerations, and could not, or would not,
view it in its moral bearings.  But we should not, we
confess, be satisfied to see the institutions founded by the
bounty of the nation for the shelter of its veteran defenders,
consist merely of so many ranges of hovels. The economy,
we apprehend, would neither be appropriate nor profitable.

  <p>" 'The edifice was founded, not on the ruins of a Royal
palace, but has by gradual steps grown out of one, till it
has eclipsed, both in extent and actual magnificence, many
of those at present existing, and which are now occupied by
Royal or Imperial tenants.' <note place="foot" n="1">Hunter's "<title> History of London and its Environs,</title>" 4to., vol. ii., p. 156.
</note> No fewer than four of our
English sovereigns were born in the palace which stood on
its site-viz., <persName key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</persName>., <persName key="Edward VI">Edward VI</persName>., <persName key="Mary">Mary</persName>, and <persName key="Eliza-
beth">Elizabeth</persName>. It was the favourite abode of the first and last of
these monarchs.  From about the year <date value="1300">1300</date>, for nearly
400 years, it was the scene of Royal magnificence and
courtly splendour. The last of our kings who inhabited
<placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName> was <persName key="Charles I">Charles I</persName>. It was subsequently occasionally
visited by the Protector, and after him by <persName key="Charles II">Charles II</persName>., who
resolved to restore it from the decay into which it had then
fallen with superior grandeur, and who completed the resto-
ration of one wing of the palace. No further progress was
made in its restoration till the reign of <persName key="William III">William III</persName>., whose
Queen, <persName key="Mary">Mary</persName>, is said to have suggested to him the idea of
making it an asylum for the aged and disabled seamen of the
<orgName key="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</orgName>; and it was at length determined, upon the
recommendation of <persName key="Wren, Christopher">Sir Christopher Wren</persName>, that the unfinished
palace should be enlarged and adapted to this charitable
purpose. The property was forthwith vested in the hands
of trustees, and commissioners appointed. The King con-
tributed the sum of 2,0001., the commissioners nearly 8,0001.,
and <persName key="Christopher">Sir Christopher</persName> engaged to superintend the work without
pecuniary emolument. The foundation of the present Hos-

              <pb id="p.91" n="91"/>

passed in the same year, by which 6d. per month of the
wages of all seamen belonging to the <orgName key="Royal Navy ">Royal Navy </orgName>is appro-
priated to the benefit of the Institution. Since that time
large sums have been contributed to the Hospital by bene-
volent individuals, and forfeited estates transferred to it, of
which the estate of the unfortunate <persName key="Earl of Derwentwater">Earl of Derwentwater</persName> is
the most considerable. The buildings have been successively
enlarged and improved, and the present annual income of
the Hospital is about 90,0001. Hunter has well observed,
'The idea of lodging the veterans of the <orgName key="British Navy">British Navy</orgName> in
a palace seems worthy of the dignity of the first maritime
power in the world; and the whole establishment, by the
rank and number of its officers and directors, fills the mind
with an appropriate greatness of character.' To this, how-
ever, he was led to add, probably with some measure of
truth, 'Yet it may be questioned whether the real comfort
of the persons to whose use it is devoted might not have
been better consulted by a greater attention to convenience
and accommodation, and a less regard to splendour.'"</p></div3>

  <p>"The pensioners who are the objects of this charity must
be seamen or marines, disabled by age, or maimed in the
Queen's service. Foreigners, who have served two years in
the <orgName key="British Navy">British Navy</orgName>, are also admitted; as also merchant-
seamen, who have received wounds in defending or taking
any ship, or in fight against a pirate.  The widows of
seamen are also provided for in the establishment, and
enjoy exclusively the privilege of being appointed nurses.</p>
 <p> "Probably few of our readers will be prepared to hear of
the large number of pensioners who are now in <orgName key="Greenwich
Hospital">Greenwich
Hospital</orgName>. Every Saturday night all are expected to sleep
within the building, and the gates then close on very nearly
4,000 individuals, 'as many (as an officer remarked to one





<pb id="p.92" n="92"/>

of our missionaries) as would people a town, and yet
enclosed, as you see, as it were, in a nut-shell.' There are
about 2,700 pensioners, 800 boys, 103 nurses, 100 officers,
and wives, families, and servants of officers, nearly make
up the remaining 297."</p>
                     </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Their Ages" id="c2s5"><head>Their Ages.</head>

 <p> "A large number of the pensioners have been hard
drinkers, and lived irregular lives; but nevertheless, many
of them live to a great age. They are all of them old men.
None are admitted under 60, except they are maimed, and
obtain a special order from the Board. A lieutenant of the
Institution was writing down the age of one man when our
missionary entered. It was 70 years. On our missionary
remarking that it was a good old age, he remarked, ' We do
not consider that old here.' A man of 70 is almost a junior.
Most of the pensioners are older than this; many are between
80 and 90; and one has arrived at the astonishing age
of 103. Between Feb. 14 and Nov. 19 of this year, 202
pensioners have died, of whom 100 were above 70 and
under 80 years of age, 23 above 80 and under 85, 5 above
85 and under 90, 1 above 90 and under 95, and 2 above 95
and under 100."</p>
                 </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Their Present Number" id="c2s6"><head>Their Present Number.</head>
 <p> Since that period the number of in-pensioners has some-
what decreased.  In  <date value="1853-01">January,1853</date>, there were 2,350
pensioners within the Hospital. Of these, the oldest man
then was 98.</p>
                 </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="The Yearly Deaths" id="c2s7"><head>  The Yearly Deaths.</head>
  <p>The magazine just quoted from stated further :-
  "About 300 of the pensioners die annually. During the
last 19 years, 5,755 have died, being an average of 302 each
year.  At particularly trying seasons the mortality is





              <pb id="p.93" n="93"/>

especially great.  All who die are interred within 48
hours.</p>
   <p>Whether, therefore, we consider the age and physical
condition of these men, or the national debt we owe them, as
having exposed their lives for the safety of their country,
they have, we had almost said, a stronger claim on our
Christian sympathy than any other body of individuals.-
Very soon they will ALL be in eternity."</p>
 <p> Last year was a year of less mortality than usual in the
Hospital. Yet 291 pensioners died at <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName> in <date value="1852">1852</date>,
and the average of deaths there for the last 10 years is 308,
which exceeds the previous average by 6. The following

<p>  An additional extract from the <title>"London City Mission
Magazine"</title> will complete the information which it is desirable
to give of the arrangements of the Hospital, and of the
practices of the pensioners:-</p>
  <p>" The pensioners have 2 chaplains, and there is a chapel
in the Hospital, which accommodates 1,400 persons, and
which is always quite filled with them on Sundays, as they
are under obligation to attend there, or at their own place of
worship, except ill. Other persons are not admitted to the
service at this chapel.  There are about 200 Roman
Catholics among the pensioners, for whose benefit there is
a priest, to whom the Hospital pays a certain amount per
annum, and who attends to those of his own persuasion in
the different wards.  Besides the 1,400 pensioners who
attend their own chapel, there are about 350 who attend
elsewhere. The rest are prevented attending by old age,
infirmity, or sickness. Bibles are placed in the wards, but
there is too much reason to fear that they are not much
read. The pensioners have also an excellent library. It
contains, at the present time, 1,584 volumes of a standard
character, and consists of biography, naval history, &#x0026;c., &#x0026;c.,
some of the better class of novels and tales, and many
excellent works on divinity.  Our missionary especially
happened to observe Scott's Commentary. The books are
not allowed to be taken out, but the pensioners come
into the library to read them-18 were present when our




               <pb id="p.95" n="95"/>

missionary visited it. Periodical literature, and three daily
newspapers are taken in for their use. Prayers are said in
the Hospital chapel every morning during the week, except
Monday and Saturday. From 40 to 50 pensioners attend,
and on Sacrament Sundays, about 60 of the pensioners
receive the holy communion. Eighty-three pensioners (so
far as we could learn) are communicants at Dissenting
chapels in the town. In one of the churches, seats have
also been appropriated to the pensioners. Immoralities are
punished with some strictness of discipline, when discovered,
by the College authorities.</p>
  <p>"In spite, however, of all these efforts for their good, the
pensioners are generally discontented and unhappy, probably
for want of employment, and through the great change in
their circumstances; and a large proportion of them are
depraved in their characters, associations, and habits. To
the extent of their means, they lead lives of drunkenness and
profligacy. Only twelve of the pensioners belong to the
<orgName key="Greenwich Teetotal Society">Greenwich Teetotal Society</orgName>. While our missionaries were
in<placeName key="Greenwich"> Greenwich</placeName>, a pensioner, aged 95, was confined for
drunkenness. They beheld many sad scenes of drunkenness
in the streets. As an example, in passing a public-house,
they saw a grey-headed pensioner come out in a state of
intoxication, and without provocation begin to strike a
woman about her head with his stick. Such cases are sadly
frequent."</p>

</div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="The Pensioners not allowed to marry, and the bad Effects of this Rule" id="c2s10"><head>The Pensioners not allowed to marry, and the bad Effects of
                       this Rule.</head>
  <p>"About 250 of the pensioners have entered the Hospital as
married men. They are allowed to sleep out of the building
every night but Saturday, and are to be found living with
their wives in different parts of the town. But after enter-
ing the Hospital, the pensioners are not allowed to marry.





<pb id="p.96" n="96"/>

We are sorry to have to add, that many of them, however,
live without marriage with women, as they call it, 'on the
sly.' These women are too often, as may be supposed,
women of very bad character. To support these women,
they have frequently much difficulty. Some of them are
obliged to carry on trades, such as shoemaking, tailoring,
&#x0026;c., and others manage secretly to carry out of the Hospital
part of the provisions, and half starve themselves. The
pensioners are prohibited from marrying, because they
brought so very heavy a burden on the parish by their
wives and children. But the prohibition has by no means
remedied this evil, for the children of unmarried pensioners
cost the parish a considerable sum. All such cases are
marked in the parish books ' G. H.'  It is truly disgraceful
to see so many of these hoary-headed men in such constant
company with young fallen females, in every part of the
town. The tobacco-money, we fear, of a large number of
them, is spent on such worthless characters, or at low public-
houses. Many young unsuspecting girls are ruined by these
old sinners.</p>
 <p> " The pensioners mess in common; and, in addition to their
lodging, clothing, and maintenance, the boatswains are allowed
2s. 6d., mates Is. 6d., and privates Is. per week for pocket-
money. Each private has a further allowance of three pints of
beer a-day, and half-a-gallon on festival days. Much drinking
and wickedness are carried on upon these latter occasions."</p>

               </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="The Royal Hospital Schools" id="c2s11"><head>The Royal Hospital Schools.</head>
  <p>"<orgName key="The Royal Hospital Schools">The Royal Hospital Schools</orgName> at the present time contain
800 boys, 400 of whom are the children of seamen in the
navy, or of non-commissioned officers and privates of the
marines, and 400 the sons of officers, seamen, and marines
in the Queen's service, &#x0026;c. They are supported from the
general funds of the Hospital. The boys leave the schools





                   <pb id="p.97" n="97"/>

at the age of 14 or 15. Till a few years since, there was
also a girls' school, which contained 200 girls. But this was
done away about the year <date value="1840">1840</date>, partly through cases of
disgrace to the Hospital, which resulted from the admission
of females within the edifice."</p>

</div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Law Agency in a peculiar manner important with these Men" id="c2s12"><head>Lay Agency in a peculiar manner important with these Men.</head>
  <p>Some of the foregoing circumstances are exceedingly
painful to allude to. But they show the importance of every
effort for the religious benefit of these veterans.
  The allowance of beer referred to in the previous extract,
as existing in  <date value="1846-12">December,1846</date>, has been since reduced from
3 to 2 pints a-day.</p>
  <p>It is probably with men of the stamp of these pensioners
that the importance of lay agency in imparting religious
instruction has been remarkably shown. The importance of
2 chaplains is great, but it by no means suffices, without
subordinate helps. These old men require very plain and
familiar treatment.  They are extremely fond of social
meetings for prayer and exposition of the Scriptures, and
will attend them with great frequency and in large numbers,
when they will not attend daily prayers in the chapel of
the Hospital. Having nothing to do also, it is really
agreeable to them  to have some one constantly among
them, with whom they can converse without restraint.
They will bear a much larger amount of religious visiting
than other classes, and it is most important that they should
have it.</p>

which has one missionary, who devotes his entire
time to the visitation of the different wards. He has been
now thus employed for the last 7 years. His appointment
has been the means of great good, and he has a most im-
portant field of labour. He appears also to work harmoniously
with the chaplains and other authorities.  His support is
derived from the pensioners themselves, and from the contri-
butions of children.

  <p>There is, however, employment for a second missionary to
visit the pensioners who are found without the Hospital
every day, perambulating all parts of the town and park,
where they may be freely conversed with on their eternal
interests. At present one missionary is unable to attend to
all which is required. The interior of the building is full
employment for one lay agent, and the pensioners out of
doors would be full employment for a second. On wet days,
they would be to be met with too numerously by far in
public-houses, where, with judgment, they might be followed
and conversed with.</p>

  <p>The <title>"London City Mission Magazine"</title> states:</p>
  <p>"The missionaries we sent down to <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName> to explore
its condition met with frequent testimonies of the value in
which the <orgName key="Royal Hospital Missionary">Royal Hospital Missionary</orgName> is held, especially
among the pensioners. One person said, 'What we want
are such meetings as Mr. C-'s,' mentioning his name. And
another said, 'We want six such men as Mr. C- here,
instead of one.' These missionaries, when down at Green-
wich, attended one of the meetings of Mr. C-, at which 3
pious old pensioners in rotation engaged in prayer. It was





                <pb id="p.99" n="99"/>

truly delightful to them to witness how near their hearts lay
the welfare of the College and its inmates. Their devotion
was warm, and their petitions evangelical. They prayed
with especial earnestness for all their fellow-pensioners.
The first of them in his prayer said, ' We know, 0 Lord,
scores in the College who are Infidels, drunkards, and
everything that is contrary to God and his Word.' The
second prayed, 'Answer, oh answer, O Lord, our cries for
the College;' and the third, in his prayer, prayed for his
fellow-believers there, that their faith, holiness, &#x0026;c., might
be increased; and then he added, ' And may all believers be
united in praying for the College;' to which, throughout the
pensioners present, there was a loud and hearty 'Amen.'
The new room (accommodating 200 persons) had not then
been engaged, and the room in which they were assembled
was so crowded, that a considerable number of those who
desired to get in were obliged, for want of room, to stand
outside, and hear as well as they could. The scene was very
animating, and full of encouragement."

  <p>The Report for <date value="1851">1851</date> commences with the following general
statement :-" I have free access to every part of the Hospital.
No obstacle whatever is thrown in my way. My visits are
thankfully received, with a very few exceptions. If there is






<pb id="p.100" n="100"/>

one class of individuals more than another who demand our
sympathy, they are the <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName> pensioners, who are
tottering on the verge of eternity, and who are daily passing
away into an eternal world.  The vast majority, I have
reason to fear, are unprepared for the solemn change.
There are many, however, who are truly pious, of whom
some owe the change to God's blessing on the efforts of the
<orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName>. A portion of these were once sunk
deep in depravity, but they are now living exemplarily, and
giving very practical evidence of the reality of the change
which has been effected in them."</p>
 <p> Then follows a narration of particular cases of usefulness
which had occurred during the year.</p>
  <p>First, an old pensioner is referred to, who during the year
had become a communicant at the <placeName key="College Chapel">College Chapel</placeName>. He had
been long entirely ignorant of spiritual things. An attend-
ance at the missionary's meeting, 3 years before, had first
opened his understanding. The consistency of his conduct
in the interim testifies to the impression made on his mind.</p>
  <p>Then comes the case of a man who had been at sea 7
years, and in several skirmishes, although in no general
engagement. At <placeName key="New Orleans">New Orleans</placeName> he had been laid up with
yellow fever, which carried off thousands. To use his own
words, "If I had died then, I should have gone direct to
hell, for a greater drunkard could not have been." He had
been in the Hospital 10 years, and had then attended the
meetings of the missionary a year and a-half. Up to that
time his habits of drinking had been continued; and he had
generally a heavy score against him at the public-house.
He is now a sober man, and the old scores have been long
since cleared off. Nor is evidence wanting of the heart as
well as the life having experienced a great change.</p>
  <p>A narrative succeeds of a man of colour from <placeName key="America">America</placeName>,
who had been 35 years at sea, and was in the battle of





             <pb id="p.101" n="101"/>

Navarino, as well as in other engagements, but had never
hought of the mercy of God in preserving him in the midst
of so many and imminent dangers, both in the days of battle
and while crossing the mighty deep. At <placeName key="China">China</placeName>, shortly after
an engagement, although he escaped the enemy's hand, he was
smitten by an unseen power with a paralytic stroke, which
deprived him of the use of one side. He was then sent home
as unfit for further service, and after entering the Hospital,
although so afflicted, he remained a rebel against God for
nearly 6 months, and was frequently the worse for liquor. At
length one of his cabin mates invited him to attend the
meeting, when what he heard came home with Divine power
to his heart. He at once abandoned his former companions,
and for 2 years at that time he had been an altered man.
He was to be constantly seen in the ward with his Bible
before him, which before he never thought of reading. He
subscribed his penny a-week towards the support of the
missionary. He would put his hand on his breast, and say,
in his own peculiar and characteristic phraseology, " The
promises come in here with sweetness. It was the best day's
work I ever did, when I came into <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName>. I had
been overboard all my life before, but now, thank God, He
has taken me into the life-boat."</p>
  <p>Next comes the case of a very aged pensioner of 84, who,
until he attended the meetings two and a-half years before,
considered that he was a very good man, who had never
injured any one, and against whose character no one could
bring a charge. He always attended his church, when able,
and was wrapt up in his own self-righteousness. He has
now long been'convinced that he is a very wicked sinner.
For some period he was quite cast down with the conviction,
and could scarcely be brought to entertain the belief that
there was hope in the Gospel even for him. Having, how-
ever, first deeplyhumbled him, God in his mercyhas now filled






<pb id="p.102" n="102"/>

him with "joy and peace in believing." Confinement in the
Infirmary had at length prevented his attendance at the
meeting, but he had for a long time sent his shilling a-month
for the benefit of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName>, in gratitude for
its efforts on his behalf.</p>
  <p>Passing over the next two cases, that the reader may not
be wearied, although they possess interest, we come to
the case of a pensioner, who had been a marine for about 17
years, and had, on his discharge, worked on different railways
as a navvy, but had at length entered the Hospital. The
very day after his admission, the missionary met him by the
Thames and presented him with a tract, entitled, "<title> Religious
Conversation</title>." He received it with almost the expression
of a fiend, and began to pour forth a volley of abuse on the
bishops, the clergy, and all ministers of the Gospel, calling
them " a set of villains," "oppressors of the poor," &#x0026;c., &#x0026;c.
All that the missionary said was treated with contempt.
Eight months passed on before the missionary again spoke
to him. He was then seated by the fire in his ward, with
about 20 of his cabin mates. He was equally abusive as
before, and told the missionary that he would not thus go
about if he was not well paid for it. " The parsons," said
he, "are all alike in this. It is nothing more than a money-
getting system." The missionary immediately admitted that
he was paid; appealed to him, if he would work without
being paid for it; and asked him how it was possible for a
missionary or a minister to live without food any more than
himself. The missionary then proceeded to expose to him
the folly of his course, and to assure him that, if he continued
in it, it would certainly end in his eternal ruin. He only
sneered at these remarks. On the following morning the
missionary, while on his way to the meeting, happened, how-
ever, to meet him again, and invited the old man to accom-
pany him, telling him, that it was the best thing he could





             <pb id="p.103" n="103"/>

do with himself. He refused, but without abuse; and, to
the missionary's surprise, he saw him enter the room soon
after he had himself arrived. He listened with apparent
attention to the Word of God and its exposition. And, not-
withstanding the great ridicule to which an attendance at
these meetings exposes the pensioners from their comrades,
he has ever since daily attended them with regularity, both
morning and evening. He stands firm against the laugh
which is directed to him. He also daily studies the Bible
for himself. He has left off both drunkenness and swearing,
to both of which he was previously greatly addicted; and he
has himself become a subscriber to the missionary's support.
This case, as well as several others here referred to, has
been carefully inquired into by parties well competent to
form a judgment, and it appears most genuine and unmis-
takeable.</p>
  <p>Again, passing over a case which, from the grossness of
the sins described, would render it scarcely suitable to be
here recorded, although this very circumstance renders the
alteration effected the more remarkable, the Report concludes
with the case of a pensioner, much younger than usual.
He went to sea very young, and had been in the service only
a year and a-half when he lost his leg. He was then dis-
charged with a pension of 121. a-year, and worked at his
trade as a tailor. After having been foreman in a tailoring
establishment for some time, he was taken ill, and admitted
into the infirmary of the Hospital. Here he had been 3
years, and it is not likely that he will ever leave. He is to
be seen now with the Bible continually before him. How
different this is to what it was, will appear from his own
observation to the missionary: " Before I came here, I would
as soon have taken a serpent into my hand as the Word of
God, but now it is all my delight. I can now say, with
David, 'Lord, how love I thy law; therein do I meditate






<pb id="p.104" n="104"/>

day and night.' He is in the habit of receiving the Lord's
Supper monthly from one of the College clergy, and appears
to understand the nature of that sacrament, and to be a
suitable person to partake of it. The missionary's instruc-
tions have been especially useful to him.</p>

                      </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="In A.D. 1852" id="c2s18"><head>In A.D. <date value="1852">1852</date>.</head>
  <p>This Report commences with the general observations:-
"The field of my labour consists of old sailors and marines.
The vast majority of them have sunk deep in depravity.
This is not to be wondered at when the temptations to which
they were exposed during the war, both abroad and at
home, are considered. They would almost invariably spend
all their money among the worst of women, and in a few
weeks what had taken them years to earn was gone. These
practices have grown with their growth and strengthened
with their strength. Drunkenness and swearing have become
so habitual to them that they scarcely regard them as crimes.
When I have remonstrated with them on account of these
sins, the frequent reply has been,-' We hope God will make
allowance for sailors. We have always been used to it, and
cannot give it up very easy.' But, notwithstanding the
depth of depravity into which many of these old men have
fallen, there are among them many living monuments of the
power of Divine grace, showing that there is nothing impos-
sible with God, but that he can soften the hardest heart and
subdue the most perverse will."</p>
  <p>As illustrations of that year's usefulness of the missionary
among this class, a case is first of all related of an old pensioner
who had been 19 years in Her Majesty's service and seen
several engagements. Five years since the missionary found
him most ignorant and unconcerned as to all matters of reli-
gion. He was also a great swearer. His wife was induced
to attend the familiar meetings for prayer and exposition of






              <pb id="p.105" n="105"/>

the<title> Scriptures</title>, which were made useful to her. She then
endeavoured to prevail on her husband to attend, but to no
purpose. He only jeered at her, and cursed and swore most
awfully. '" Do you think," he would say, "I am such a fool
as to leave this comfortable fire to go to hear that fellow?"
At length he was, however, induced to accompany his wife
for once. The subject was, true Christians being the temples
of the Holy Ghost,-" As the Lord hath said, I will walk in
them and dwell in them; they shall be my people, and I will
be their God." On his return home he fell into a fit of
passion, and said, " He wondered the people did not turn the
fellow out of the desk, for he actually told them that God
Almighty would come down and dwell in a sinner's heart.
He must take us to be a set of fools to believe such nonsense
as that." After a while he came, however, a second time to
the meeting. On that occasion the subject was the new birth,
from <title>St. John iii</title>. The words, "Ye must be born again,"
came home to his heart; and he returned home, no more to
curse and swear, but to express true concern and sorrow for
his past course. He became, from that time, a regular
attendant on the means of grace, gave up his old companions,
and, after careful examination, was admitted a communicant,
with his wife, at one of the chapels of the town. He regu-
larly since subscribes his penny a-week to <orgName key="the Mission">the Mission</orgName>.</p>
  <p>A second case reported, as having occurred that year, is
that of an aged pensioner who had been 15 years in the
Hospital, and who had been also 15 years in active service;
but who on his discharge, in <date value="1815">1815</date>, had turned coachman,
when he sunk deeper into sin than ever. He at length got
into prison for theft. When first met with by the mission-
ary, in the Hospital, he was actually as ignorant of spiritual
things as an Hottentot. He could not even read. Now, to
employ his own nautical image, "the Saviour has hauled
down the devil's colours and hoisted up his own." His





<pb id="p.106" n="106"/>

mind has become enlightened, he has felt the evil of sin, and
he is resting his hopes only on <persName key="Christ">Christ</persName>. His life is altogether
changed. He has become a communicant at the <placeName key="College
Chapel">College
Chapel</placeName>. To testify his gratitude to the missionary, he sub-
scribes his penny a-week towards his support, and keeps the
room in which the meeting is held clean, free of charge.
He is never absent from his post there.</p>
  <p>Then comes the case of a sick pensioner, visited in the
Infirmary. He appeared impressed, by frequent visits to
his bed-side; but, knowing the deceitfulness of professions
at such times, little account was made of it by the missionary.
At length the man recovers. The impression remained.
Two years have passed away, and have not erased it. He
has, since his recovery, become a communicant, and in all
things he adorns the Gospel by his life. His language is that
of constant thankfulness that God, in his mercy, afflicted him.</p>
  <p>Then comes a case of a different order.  A very old
pensioner, who had lived beyond the three score years and
ten allotted to man, had in his youth been the subject
of religious impressions. But when his desires to go to sea
were gratified, these were all forgotten, and departed, like
the early cloud and the morning dew. He soon became,
like seafaring men in general, careless and indifferent about
religion, and this was not disturbed, even by the imminent
perils of warfare, when others around him were cut down in
quick succession. Five years since the missionary met with
him. He is now the subject of the same religious impres-
sions as at first, in his early life. For the past five years he
has evidenced the change which has occurred to him. This
year he has become a communicant at the chapel. He is
most indefatigable in his efforts to benefit his cabin-mates,
and never allows sin in them without reproof. He also
subscribes to the Mission, like the others.</p>
  <p>Passing over the two next cases, in both of which the



       <pb id="p.107" n="107"/>

pensioners visited became communicants, a case is next
recorded of an aged pensioner, whose life had previously
been of a more moral character than is usual with that class.
For four years he had attended the Meetings of the mis-
sionary, seldom missing any of them, although they are nine
each week.   The change in this man does not appear
so great, but his own testimony is that it is as entire as
marvellous. During the year he was received as a com-
municant at the Independent chapel of the town.  How
interesting is it to observe such changes effected at a period
of life so very advanced, when habits ordinarily become
fixed, and the mind of those who during a long life have
continued irreligious, become callous !</p>
  <p>Another poor old man, on the borders of the grave,
is next referred to, apparently plucked that year as a brand
from the burning. He had been altogether, in the Merchant
and in <orgName key="Her Majesty's Service">Her Majesty's Service</orgName>, 41 years at sea, and had been
shipwrecked several times, yet mercifully preserved from a
watery grave. It would be tedious to descend to particulars
in all these individual cases. Suffice it to say, that from
being ignorant and careless, he is now in earnest to secure
the salvation of his soul. His life is exemplary, and the
testimony of those around him is, " We wish we were like
him."  His pittance is very small, but out of it twopence a
week is cheerfully and voluntarily paid to the Mission,
by whose instrumentality he considers he has been so richly
benefited.</p>
  <p>Three other cases follow of an equally important and
satisfactory character; and two very happy deaths of pen-
sioners are also recorded, as having occurred during the
year, in both of which the dying men most fervently blessed
God that ever a missionary was sent to visit the Hospital.</p>
 <p> The average attendance of the pensioners at the nine
weekly Meetings is 22 in the morning, and 80 in the





<pb id="p.108" n="108"/>

evening. The old men themselves pay the rent of the room,
amounting to 71. a-year. The morning Meetings are held
from nine to ten o'clock, except on Sundays; and the
evening Meetings on three evenings in the week, from seven
to eight.</p>
<p>  About a thousand tracts are given away by the missionary
every month among the pensioners. These are very grate-
fully received by the vast majority of them. There is also
every reason to believe that they are read. In some cases
they may be made a blessing, where the word spoken would
fail. The following case, which occurred during that year
will serve as an illustration:</p>
<p>  One tobacco day, as it is called, that is, one day when the
men receive their allowance of tobacco, an old pensioner
put into the missionary's hands, while he was distributing
tracts, a paper, to be read by him when he got home. On
opening it, a shilling was found within it, and the following
sentences were written, " Sir, I am much obliged to you for
your most noble and generous acts, and for your kind tracts
to teach us the way of God. I am truly sensible that I am
a sinner before Him. I cannot go, however, to hear his
Word, as I am very deaf. But, thanks to God, I can read
the tracts; and if you please to accept of this trifle, you will
oblige your humble servant."
</p>
                      </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="In A.D. 1853" id="c2s19"><head>In A.D. <date value="1853">1853</date>.</head>
  <p>The Report for <date value="1853">1853</date> states, that there are at this time
about 200 Roman Catholics in <orgName key="Greenwich Hospital">Greenwich Hospital</orgName>, 3 Mor-
monites, and 3 Jews, one of whom occasionally attends the
Meeting; that the missionary has free access to every part of
the Hospital; that the authorities place no obstacle in his
way, and some of them countenance him, and appear glad
to hear of the improvement of any of the men; that
the pensioners generally receive him well, and even the




             <pb id="p.109" n="109"/>

most depraved acknowledge that he means well to them,
and that (to use their own words), "it would be a good job
if they were to take his advice."</p>
  <p>This Report relates to the happy death, during the year,
of six of the pensioners, the change effected in whom had
been referred to in the previous years. Is it not a matter
for joy that these brave men are now, through such instru-
mentality, as it may be not only hoped but believed, safe in
glory for eternal ages ? They all gave good evidence to the
last that the change effected in them during health was
genuine and Divine.</p>
 <p> Who shall say that the following case of benefit was not
the fruit of a mother's prayers?  A pensioner, who had
lived 70 years, and who had been to sea during the war
12 years, having been pressed on board a man of war from
<placeName key="the Isle of Man">the Isle of Man</placeName>, of which he was a native, was thus taken
away from an aged mother, who was entirely dependent
upon him for support. He gave her half his pay, as long as
she lived. He wears a silver medal given him for services
in the battle of <placeName key="Trafalgar">Trafalgar</placeName>. Both his parents were religious
persons, members of the <orgName key="Wesleyan Methodist Society">Wesleyan Methodist Society</orgName>; and
he was the subject of many prayers on the part of both
of them. At sea he appeared to have lost all his own early
impressions of religion, under careful and pious training,
and soon run into excesses of sin and folly. He was re-
ceived into the Hospital eight months since, a sad drunkard
at the verge of a long life. The missionary talked to him
faithfully. He attended the daily meetings with regularity,
and now, at this eleventh hour, his mother's prayers are
answered. He has begun to lead a new life, at 70 years
of age, and has been just admitted a communicant.</p>
  <p>The next case recorded is that of a pensioner, who had
been very many years at sea. For three years and a-half
he had been on board one ship, and during that time




<pb id="p.110" n="110"/>

he had never seen a <title>Bible</title>, or heard one read. He had sunk
very deep into depravity. For five years he had been in the
Hospital, and had been often warned, but to no purpose.
Drunkenness was his especial sin, and he used to say he
could not help it, because he had so bad a wife; but was
reminded that that made bad worse, and was adding fuel to the
flame. For the last year he has been prevailed on regularly
to attend the daily meetings, and he now gives every evi-
dence of being a changed man. He long wanted to sub-
scribe to the Society which sent the missionary, but he
determined to give whatever he could spare to his wife,
because, as he said, she was his wife, although a bad one.
Lately, however, he has begun to spare his penny a-week.
And it may be observed that both in his and in the other
cases referred to, these contributions are, in the strictest
sense of the term, free-will offerings, no one being ever
asked to contribute.</p>
  <p>The three next cases being passed over, a case is recorded
of a pensioner who had been altogether forty years at sea.
For eleven years he had been in the Hospital, and during
the six years that the missionary had been there, he had
scarcely on any occasion seen him sober. But now he
no longer drinks. His very countenance declares the change
which has taken place in his habits. Putting his hand
on his cheek, " You see," said he recently, " what a plump
face I have got now, to what I had before. My attendance
at your Meetings has made the difference."  He had before
drunk himself almost to a skeleton. He gives his twopence
a-week subscription, as a mark of gratitude to the Society.
May it not be hoped that the wonderful providence of God
has preserved this old man's life through many dangers, that
he may be made an heir of glory ? Once he was ship-
wrecked on a desert island, where, when he was about
perishing for want of water, a ship hove in sight. At





           <pb id="p.111" n="111"/>

another time he fell from the mast-head. And he had been
in dangers often.</p>
  <p>Again passing over two interesting cases, we come to an
old veteran, who had been in the battle of the <placeName key="Nile">Nile</placeName> with
<persName key="Nelson, Lord">Lord Nelson</persName>, and in <placeName key="Egypt">Egypt</placeName> with <persName key="Abercrombie, General">General Abercrombie</persName>,
fighting ashore to assist the troops. Like so many others,
he entered the Hospital, careless and unconcerned about
religion and his soul. The missionary has, however, been
blessed to arouse him to a concern for the matters most
important. He has even given up card-playing, of which
he was before passionately fond. His attention is most
marked to what he hears from the Word of God.</p>
  <p>The last case recorded is that of a pensioner who, when
first accosted, some ten months since, by the missionary,
answered him, "Now, I don't want any of your coaxing.
You won't get me over as you do some of them." At length,
however, the missionary got from him the promise that he
would come for once to the meeting. He kept his promise,
and, what is more, he has ever since continued to attend,
and appears to be deriving real profit from what he hears.
Both he and the previous pensioner give their weekly con-
tributions of gratitude for the efforts made on their behalf.</p>
  <p>At so advanced a period of life, it is not, perhaps, very
often the case that confirmed habits become changed; but
these old pensioners present many remarkable exceptions to
such a rule. How deeply interesting is it that men so old
should become "new creatures in <persName key="Crhist, Jesus">Christ Jesus</persName>" in so many
instances.

  <p>"The following extracts from a Reader's Journal, which
have passed under the eye, and met with the approval of the
clergy in whose district the reader is located, may excite
some interest. They present the case of an old weather-
beaten sailor, who was brought to the knowledge of the
truth, after 68 winters had passed over and whitened the
old man's head. He had fought at the battle of <placeName key="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName>,
in Her Majesty's ship Clio, in <date value="1801">1801</date>, and had altogether been
at sea upwards of 50 years, having earned a pension of 241.
per annum:</p>
  <p>"' <date value="1850-07-5">July 5,1850</date>.-After visiting the upper families of
this house, I went into a little room on the first floor, where
an old man was smoking his pipe. He wishing to know my
business, I explained the purport of my visit, and entered
into conversation with him. I soon introduced the subject
of religion, and spoke of the love of <persName key="Christ">Christ</persName> manifested
toward us in so many ways, especially in the grand scheme
of salvation, whereby He saved us from eternal damnation.
I then referred to man's ingratitude in return, and took out
my <title>Bible</title> and read <title>John xvii</title>. 1-3, when suddenly the old
man's countenance changed, and he became greatly agitated.
' Oh !' said he, 'believe me, sir, for that Saviour I'd be torn
to pieces, limb from limb, and yet I feel my heart as hard as
iron. What shall I do?   What shall I do?' I replied,
'The heart of man is, indeed, naturally hard; we can do
nothing ourselves; we must go to <persName key="Christ">Christ</persName>, and pray for his
Holy Spirit to purify and soften it. Do you ever pray?'</p>
<p>' No, never! I have given my blood for my country, and
fought its battles, but never prayed to my God.' 'Then,'
said I, 'believe me, you are in a very dangerous condition.'</p>
<p> 'I know what you mean,' said he, as he arose from his seat,




             <pb id="p.113" n="113"/>

and shook his fist in my face; 'you mean to say, that, if I
don't pray, I shall go to hell. I know I shall-I shall go
to hell.' 'Be not terrified,' I said; 'the blood of <persName key="Christ, Jesus">Jesus
Christ</persName> cleanseth us from all sins: ask, and ye shall have;
seek, and ye shall find. Ask his pardon, and you will not
ask in vain. Seek his love, and 'tis already found.' The
old man stood in the centre of the room and shook violently.
At last he burst into a flood of tears, and wept like a child.
I myself felt quite overcome by the scene. I could only lift
up my silent petitions for him. When he was a little more
composed, I offered to engage in prayer for him. 'Will
you,' said he, as he took my hand, ' will you pray for me ?
God Almighty bless you!' The old man sunk on the floor,
and I knelt down and engaged in prayer. As soon as I had
concluded, he grasped my hand with every token of grati-
tude, and earnestly begged of me to call again as soon as I
could, and whenever I could. 'Do you ever go to church?'
said I. 'Never,' he returned, 'never.' ' Will you come on
Sunday?' His eyes appeared to sparkle as he answered, ' I
will, I will.' 'I shall look for you, mind.' 'Believe me,
you will find me there. And now tell me when you will
come again. Pray come soon. Come whenever you can,
and you shall find me, though an old man, yet one who will
listen to your every word. I will be your scholar-any-
thing. And now, good-bye,' said he, grasping my hand till
the pressure was painful, ' God Almighty bless you.'</p>
  <p>" ' July 6.-I called on the old man to-day, and found him
at his breakfast, which consisted of bread and water. On
inquiring how he felt, he replied, 'Very miserable.' He felt
so guilty before God, he knew not what to do.  What is
worse,' said he, ' in my youthful days I had every instruction
in religious affairs, and have read the <title>Bible</title> and <title>Prayer-book</title>
through and through, so that I have sinned against light and
knowledge.' I told him, that in the eleventh hour <persName key="Christ">Christ</persName>
                            I




<pb id="p.114" n="114"/>

casts out none who come to Him, and that his blood can
wash away the vilest sins. ' Come unto me, all ye that are
weary and heavy laden.' 'Will you,' said I, 'refuse the
invitation ? To-morrow is his holy day; let me see you at
church.' 'You shall,' said he, 'if I go naked.' I then read
1 John iii., laying particular stress on the verse, 'Ye know
that He was manifested to take away our sins.' I then
engaged in prayer, which appeared much to comfort the old
man; and, as I left the room, I had the gratification of
seeing him prepare for the enjoyment of the same privilege.</p>
  <p>"' July 12.-As I approached the house, I heard the old
man joyfully exclaim, ' He's coming ! he's coming !' Directly
afterwards he came to meet me. When I went into his
room, he said, last evening he went to Islington to his
family, who lately left him, to beg a Bible, which they let
him have; and since then, he told me, he had been reading
it for hours,-he found the promises so sweet and precious
to him. ' Oh,' said he, 'I feel so happy; God has removed
from my heart that oppressive weight of sin! I find from
this, his blessed Word, that the very vilest are received by
Him, and I find it to be so with myself.' He pressed the
Bible to his lips with every demonstration of joy, and, as he
wept, said, ' These are not tears such as those you first
witnessed. I felt then I must go to hell; now I feel that
<persName key="Christ">Christ</persName> died for me. What reason have I to bless you for
calling on me ! Had you never seen me, I might still be as
I was. Oh, how gracious, how loving is God! Never have
I experienced such sensations as those which now fill my
heart. These are the happiest days of my life.' Read <title>Isaiah
liii.-lv.</title>, and <title>John iii</title>., which I endeavoured to simplify as
much as possible. Closed with prayer.</p>
<p>  "' July 19.-He appeared delighted to see me, and imme-
diately procured his <title>Bible</title>, that I might tell him something
about the things of <persName key="Christ">Christ</persName>. (I am happy to remark, that I





          <pb id="p.115" n="115"/>

had the gratification of seeing him both morning and even-
ing at our church last Sunday.) He told me that on Sunday
last, while in church, he felt as if each word had been
addressed personally to himself, and that the comfort and
instruction derived from that source had been very great.
'Did it want,' said he, 'a hundred miles to the house of God,
I would go.' I discovered this morning that his family had
lately left him in consequence of his daughter having stolen
two sovereigns from him, on which occasion he punished
her. He now thought, he said, of going to see her, in order
to forgive her; for, as he felt that Christ had forgiven him
so great a load of sin, he could no longer retain an ill-
feeling towards any one, however unworthy, but would
rather pray for her. Read <title>Romans viii</title>. 31-39. He appears
very humble.</p>
  <p>"' July 30.-He was very much pleased to see me, and
appears in every respect humble and meek, as a Christian
ought to be; and I feel gratified to say, that every visit
finds him more and more improved in spiritual things. I
see him regular at the house of God, and most attentive when
there; in his own room I find the <title>Bible</title> and <title>Prayer-book</title>
his constant companions. He told me that all his friends
had left him,-I was the only exception; but he was well
compensated, as he would rather see me than any other
individual in the world. No one, he added, could for a
moment conceive the change of mind that had passed over
him since he had known me: he would not exchange his
feelings and condition for a coronet or the greatest noble-
man's wealth in England. Read <title>2 Cor. v. 13-21</title>. He
appeared very attentive. I explained several passages of
<title>Scripture</title>, and closed with prayer. I have now no doubt of
his being a sincere Christian.</p>
  <p>"' August 12.-I am happy to say that this poor man is
going on in the most satisfactory way. He told me he felt
                           2




<pb id="p.116" n="116"/>

the great necessity of watchfulness and prayer. ' Directly,'
said he, 'an improper thought or feeling enters my mind, I
betake myself to prayer and God's holy Word, and the
temptation is soon vanquished; and now I wish to make a
full profession of my faith, by being a recipient of the Lord's
Supper.' I encouraged him in this wish; and having read
a portion of <title>Scripture </title>(Rev. xxi. 22-27), closed with
prayer.</p>
  <p>"' August 17.-I found him rather in a distressed state.
He thought himself scarcely prepared yet to be a partaker
of the Lord's Supper, at the same time he earnestly desired
to be there. After a long conversation with him, I over-
came his objections, and, his doubts being removed, I read
<title>Psalm xxiii</title>., and advised him to spend the afternoon in
prayer and meditation.</p>
  <p>"' August 24.-This poor man received the Lord's Supper
last Sunday. He thought it the happiest day he ever spent.
I had removed his doubts, he said, and he determined to go;
but it was with fear and trembling he approached the table,
yet he returned filled, enriched with God's presence and
love. 'Oh, the happiness of that moment,' he observed,
'words cannot express it! and now, by God's grace, there
shall I go till death prevents me.' This poor man appears,
as it were, to mount the third heaven. He cannot think of
God but tears of joy and gratitude bedew his cheeks; his
soul appears to drink in with increasing joy the showers of
God's Spirit. In his very countenance love and humility
appear concentrated, and his respectful deportment is that
which no Christian need fear to imitate. He sees the past
in all its deformity,-the future in all its blissfulness; and
daily, at the throne of grace, he zealously advocates the cause
of those instrumental to his good.'"</p>

missionary of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName>, in whose district the

  <p>"The plot of ground on which Albion has erected this

was, at the close of the 16th century, called ' <placeName key="Thame Shot">Thame Shot</placeName>,'

The then newly-established <orgName key="Church of England">Church of England</orgName> being greatly

who was himself fond of controversy, and having received

<date value="1610">1610</date>, the King, in person, laid the foundation-stone, and a
charter was bestowed, fixing the number of its fellows at a
provost, and 19 fellows. The continuance of this noble
institution was short, for in 20 years it had almost ceased to
exist. But it had enrolled many names amongst its fellows
that are yet illustrious. Amongst others were <persName key="Camden">Camden</persName>,

<persName key="Charles">Charles</persName> seriously contemplated such a project, and the

<p>  "<persName key="Gwynne, Nell"> Nell Gwynne</persName> was sitting one day with the King in her
summer-house, whose windows overlooked the adjacent
meadows of <orgName key="King James's College">King James's College</orgName>, when the Paymaster of
the Forces entered, and the conversation turned on the
difficulty of finding a suitable site for the projected Hospital.
'Your Majesty could not do better,' said <persName key="Fox, Sir Stephen">Sir Stephen Fox</persName>,
'than give up for the purpose your recent purchase from
the<orgName key=" Royal Society"> Royal Society</orgName>.'  'It is well thought of,' replied the

have it.'  But, recollecting himself, he instantly added,
'Odso! I forgot. I have already given this land to <persName key="Gwynne, Nell">Nell</persName>

'then I will return it to you again for so good a purpose.'
The generous offer was accepted, and Nell being transferred
to a mansion which the King built for her in Pall-mall,
<placeName key="Thame Shot">Thame Shot</placeName>, with the meadows and closes adjacent, were

The Hospital has continued to this day, unaffected by the
succession of kings and the changes of governments, and is
supported partly by bequests, and partly by assistance from
Government."
</p>
           </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Number of In-pensioners admitted" id="c2s24"><head> Number of In-pensioners admitted.</head>
  <p>"The number of pensioners inhabiting the Hospital is 538.
This is the full complement which the building will contain,
and any deficiencies in this number which occur are supplied
quarterly from the out-pensioners."</p>
</div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Their Character" id="c2s25"><head>
                     Their Character.</head>
<p>  " As a class, they are peculiarly open to religious instruction.
Sitting in groups around the grounds and in the wards, they
love to talk, and to be talked to. Having arrived at that stage
of life when, as Paley says, ease is positive enjoyment, their
minds are far more active than their bodies, and anything
that affords them food for thought is generally welcome.
The respectful habits which they have been accustomed to
observe towards their superior officers, they manifest towards
every respectable person. So far, the work of a religious
teacher would be peculiarly open and easy amongst them.
Still the teacher would not be without his difficulties. The
habit of intemperance which they have very generally
formed in the army, and which mostly clings to them still, is
a sad feature in their character. Their habit of swearing
(sometimes as a soldier or sailor only can swear) is very
deplorable; and their habit of grumbling and expressing
dissatisfaction with the arrangements made for their welfare
(perhaps the result of old age and infirmity), one could wish





<pb id="p.120" n="120"/>

to see corrected. These things show the necessity that still
exists amongst them for Christian instruction, notwithstanding
the zealous labours of their excellent Chaplain to impart it."</p>

</div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Out-pensioners" id="c2s26"><head> Out-pensioners.</head>
   <p>"But, beside the pensioners who reside in the Hospital,
there are upwards of 50,000, who reside throughout the
world, and receive so much per diem, according to their
length of service, their position in the army, and their former
enterprises. Large numbers of these reside in the imme-
diate vicinity of the Hospital.  Nearly one-half of the
people on my district are out-pensioners. Several lodging-
houses are filled with them. I am therefore able to speak of
them from a large acquaintance with them. As a class, they
are much worse in moral character than those who dwell in
the Hospital, who are subject to several restraints on open
wickedness.  Drunkenness is their besetting sin.  Their
pension is generally paid at the beginning of each month,
and for 4 or 5 days afterwards drunkenness is so prevalent
on my district, that my labours are considerably impeded.
Drink they will have, if they starve for it afterwards. It
is my privilege to labour in connexion with a clergyman,
whose indefatigable zeal and activity has brought him
acquainted with nearly every family on my district, and I
believe the above statement agrees with our common
experience.  Some of the pensioners live in a very
improper state with women; and it is said of some women
on my district, that they receive old men from the College.
When they are sober, I am able at all times to read or
explain to them the Holy Scripture. They are, in all cases,
most civil and friendly. Not unfrequently will they repay
my teaching with a recital of their wanderings and battles,
and, like the parson's guest in the village of sweet Auburn,
       " Shoulder a crutch, and show how fields were won."




                 <pb id="p.121" n="121"/>

They love to talk over their victories, and to discuss the
merits of the various commanders under whom they served.
They are also generally fond of reading newspapers. Like
their brethren in the Hospital, they manifest the same dis-
content with their portion. Some of them are able to follow
an occupation, but the far greater number live entirely on
their pensions."</p>

</div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="The Pensioners' Opinions of the late Duke of Wellington, and of Lying-in-State" id="c2s27"><head>The Pensioners' Opinions of the late <persName key="Wellington, Duke of"> Duke of Wellington</persName>,
                and of the Lying-in-State.</head>
  <p>"It has been evident, I suppose, to every one who has had
much intercourse with these men, that they entertained no
affection for the late<persName key="Wellington, Duke of"> Duke of Wellington</persName>. The unbending
sternness of his character, the severity with which he enforced
discipline in the <placeName key="Peninsula">Peninsula</placeName>, and the strict regard to justice
and the public purse with which he awarded pensions at
home, acting upon ill - informed and not over - scrupulous
minds, created a feeling amongst them that he was not a
soldier's friend. This unhappy impression obtained to such
a degree, that his name was seldom mentioned by them with
respect.  'Ah!' said one to me, 'he was not like <persName key="Hill, Lord">Lord Hill</persName> <persName key="Hill, Lord">Lord Hill</persName> was a Christian, and had a feeling for his
soldiers; but nobody liked <placeName key="Wellington">Wellington</placeName>.'  ' Well,' said
another, 'he's got great honours and great riches, but it's all
through the bravery of his troops, and now he does not care
if they starve. He tried to bring a Bill into <orgName key="Parliament">Parliament</orgName> to
lessen our pensions, but the <placeName key="Richard, Duke of">Duke of Richmond </placeName>said, " Let us
begin at the top of the tree, if we begin at all to diminish
pensions;" but <persName key="Wellington, lord">Wellington </persName>did not like to have his own pen-
sion lessened.' 'Why, bless your heart!' said another, 'he
would hang up his men like dogs, if they only took a penny
loaf out of a baker's shop, when they were on a hard march
and almost starving.' Such remarks were very common in
<persName key="Wellington, Lord">Wellington's</persName> lifetime, but when the news got abroad that






<pb id="p.122" n="122"/>

he was dead, they were more common still. As a faithful
chronicler I am bound to report them, though I by no means
sympathize with them. They are interesting, as showing
the perversity of human nature. The man who fought for
his country from motives of duty died unlamented by his
soldiery, whilst the man who fought for mere personal
aggrandizement, from motives of vain-glory, was almost
deified by his army after his death.</p>
  <p>"The lying-in-state at <orgName key="Chelsea Hospital">Chelsea Hospital</orgName> was regarded by
many of the pensioners, and by the poor in general, as
impious, and as a relio of Romish superstition. One woman
observed to a brother missionary, after having seen the sight,
' Well! if that isn't the best Irish wake I ever saw!'
Another, in the crowd, observed, 'If his soul is in heaven,
how he must look down with pity upon such a ceremony!
and if he is in hell, what a mockery it is to his suffering !'"</p>

</div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="The Crowds of the Public who assembled to see the Spectacle" id="c2s28"><head>The Crowds of the Public who assembled to see the Spectacle.</head>
  <p>" But, whatever might be the private opinion of the people
respecting the Duke and his lying-in-state, they manifested
a universal desire to witness what would probably be the
last specimen of the funereal pageantry of kings in a bygone
age. Many of the higher and more intelligent classes of
society came, no doubt, to pay a tribute of respect to
departed worth, but the overwhelming majority were mere
sightseers. The train of carriages which conveyed the elite
of the country to the hall of state was truly surprising. At
one hour of the day there could not have been less than one
mile and a-half's length of carriages waiting to set down
their passengers, and the day was exceedingly rainy. Ladies,
dressed in the most costly manner, might have been seen
bespattered with mud, and wading through dirt with their
slender shoes, because, when they had seen the sight, their
carriages were unable to get sufficiently near to take them






               <pb id="p.123" n="123"/>

up at the point of egress. To many of the coachmen and
footmen I gave tracts.</p>
 <p> "The first day of public admission commenced, and at an
early hour entrance into the hall was easy; but the full tide of
human beings had set in towards the Hospital, and the mass
soon became enormous. The lady of my respected local
superintendent, whose house overlooks the entrance of the
Hospital, thus describes the scene, as it appeared from their
windows :-' At about 11 o'clock, the <placeName key="Queen's-road">Queen's-road</placeName>, between
the College and the green opposite, was one dense, black
line of innumerable people and carriages. It soon became
apparent that the police were under some measure of alarm.
We could distinguish them, mounted on the iron rails and
cabs, and exhorting the people to keep back. There was
much screaming and evident suffering in the crowd, and the
steam from them rose, as a cloud of smoke, the whole length
of the road. A few minutes more, and 2 bodies were carried
past, the way for them being made through the crowd by
mounted police. About noon a new arrangement was adopted
by opening the green, which relieved the pressure, by allow-
ing the crowd to return another way. The returning crowds
pressed under our windows, and we saw many women
fainting with exhaustion, some with their clothes torn from
them, and some who had lost one or both shoes.'</p>
 <p> " At night men were set to work to erect barriers, to lay
down gas, and to make entirely new arrangements for
Monday. The whole of Sunday was occupied with these
preparations.</p>
  <p>" Monday morning opened with crowds greater than ever,
surrounding the Hospital, but owing to the barriers erected,
to prevent the crowds pressing too densely on one another,
no very serious accident occurred.  One woman who had
been pressed in the crowd I saw vomiting blood in Smith-
street. Another had the skirts of her gown torn completely





<pb id="p.124" n="124"/>

away, and the soles of her shoes trodden off the upper parts.
The mud had been worked up around the Hospital by the
rain and the large concourse of pedestrians, so that every
person was greatly bespattered by it. This almost emptied
my district of men and youths. Providing themselves with
a stool each, and brushes and blacking, they lined the pave-
ments around the Hospital for many score of yards, and
allured the returning visitors to expend a penny on the
polishing of their miry shoes, each one assuring the public
that theirs was the true Wellington polish, or that theirs
was the genuine Victoria blacking. Soon, however, the
<orgName key="Ragged School Brigade ">Ragged School Brigade </orgName>were in the field, and secured to
themselves a full share in the rich harvest my people had
been reaping. Nor were these the only persons who turned
a public loss into a private advantage. Correct portrait
sellers and medal vendors were very numerous; and men and
children earned a good large sum by holding horses, and
finding carriages for those who had been in the hall. Many
people opened their houses as tea and coffee-houses, and
touted at the doors for customers. The public-houses in the
neighbourhood were also filled to overflowing.</p>
  <p>" Tuesday brought greater crowds than ever to witness the
splendid ceremonial. It was with the greatest difficulty
that I could get from my home to my district. The broad
mass of persons waiting for admission at one part of the day
reached about 600 yards. So densely were they packed,
that the lady of the clergyman, to whom I have before
referred, saw a gentleman who had the seals of his letters
melted in his pocket by the heat of the crowd. Fainting
females were very numerous.  My kind superintendent's
house being very convenient, he generously opened it
as an asylum in such cases.   In the evening he was
not able to count up the number of cases which had been
brought in and nursed during the day.</p>





           <pb id="p.125" n="125"/>

 <p> "On Wednesday the people seemed to have gathered
together more numerously than ever. Many who had been
disappointed several times on previous days in trying to
reach the hall of death, were determined to make a last
effort to-day. So great was the crowd, that it reached from
the College, through the Green, through <placeName key="Avenue-terrace">Avenue-terrace</placeName>,
and a long distance up and down <placeName key="King's-road">King's-road</placeName>, besides those
who were admitted through <placeName key="St. Leonard's-terrace">St. Leonard's-terrace</placeName> and the
<placeName key="Queen's-road">Queen's-road</placeName>.  At the close of the day, many who had
come hundreds of miles to see the sight went away dis-
appointed.</p>
  <p>"' Having described in some measure the masses who came
to witness the lying-in-state, I will now relate some of the
Christian efforts made to turn this solemnity to the further-
ance of the <title>Gospel</title>. Finding it impossible to pursue my
work on my district, I gathered up a large number of tracts
which had remained to me out of former months' distri-
bution, and went amongst the crowd, giving them to such
persons as seemed likely to profit by them.  There were
few cases in which they were not kindly and eagerly
received. Seven hundred tracts were distributed by me in
a few hours, and I went home for more. I continued it
each day, and had the satisfaction of seeing many to whom I
had given tracts stand in the crowd reading them. The
police also were most willing to receive tracts, and to many
I gave them. Several of my brother missionaries were
similarly employed.  Nor were some of the clergy and
Christian people in the neighbourhood unmindful of this
excellent opportunity of making known their Lord's will.
My respected local superintendent gave away a large
number of tracts; and such was the rush of the people
and policemen to receive them, that his wife was compelled
on Wednesday to leave the door, and go into the balcony
to distribute them.  Indeed, nothing could exceed the






<pb id="p.126" n="126"/>

thankfulness with which the people in general received
tracts.</p>
  <p>" How the people behaved on the occasion, when they were
assembled in such vast masses, it must be interesting and
important to know. Of this there can be but one opinion,
and that is in their favour.  Nothing could exceed the
quietness and patience with which they waited for their
turn of admission to the Hospital, nor the orderly manner in
which they moved forward in subjection to the police, nor
the regard and ready assistance which they bestowed on
females fainting in the crowd from heat and pressure. The
tedium of delay was beguiled by lively sallies of wit, and a
continuous current of cheerful conversation.  In such a
crowd pressure was to be expected, but no serious accident
occurred after the first day. Very large numbers of females
had put on some articles of mourning, but it was to be
gathered from the conversation, that this was partly owing
to the impression that no one would be admitted to the hall
without it. If the gatherings of a nation be any index of
its sense of decency and propriety, England has reason to
congratulate herself, and take courage.  Even vice on this
occasion was content to wear the appearance of virtue, or to
hide itself in the recesses of the neighbouring beer-shops.</p>
  <p> "But I must not forget to notice the praiseworthy conduct
of the police in keeping order. Time was when the people
and the police could by no means agree, but during the
lying-in-state they appeared on the most friendly terms.
The police joked with the people, and the people with the
police, so that it was frequently very amusing to hear them.
To distressed females the police were particularly attentive.
Wherever there was danger they used the utmost exertions
to avert it. Their arrangements were most complete and
satisfactory, after the first day's admission, from which time
no serious accident occurred.

 <p> "In conclusion, I would suggest to all men to consider
whether so much orderly and peaceful behaviour, manifested
by all classes of society on so exciting an occasion, and con-
trasting so strikingly with popular gatherings in days gone
by, may not be traceable to the socializing influence of
religion, as applied to the masses through the <orgName key="agency of

<p>  The number of the out-pensioners of <orgName key="Chelsea Hospital ">Chelsea Hospital </orgName>has
much varied at different times. It has been least during

and the <title>Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle</title>, which, in <date value="1750">1750</date>, raised
the number to 9,087. It then somewhat decreased again,
until the<title> Treaty of Fontainebleau</title>, which, in <date value="1765">1765</date>, increased

<placeName key="America">America</placeName>, <placeName key="France">France</placeName>, and <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>, by <date value="1780">1780</date> had reduced the

again increased the number, in <date value="1785">1785</date>, to 20,273. The war
with <placeName key="France">France</placeName>, subsequent on the French Revolution, had
again, in <date value="1795">1795</date>, reduced the number to 16,955. The Treaty
of Amiens once more increased it, in <date value="1803">1803</date>, to 25,307; and
on the war being very shortly afterwards renewed, the
number was again lessened. But after the abdication of
<persName key="Buonaparte, Napoleon">Buonaparte</persName> and the general peace, the numbers rapidly rose.
In <date value="1814">1814</date> the number of the out-pensioners of <orgName key="Chelsea

of 44,650l.  Altogether, the total expenditure upon out-

<p>  It may be interesting to the reader that we should briefly
glance at the mode in which the heavy payment now
imposed upon us was dispensed with before <orgName key="Chelsea Hospital">Chelsea Hospital</orgName> had its foundation. We quote from a volume entitled,
" <orgName key="Chelsea Hospital">Chelsea Hospital</orgName> and its Traditions," <note place="foot" n="1">Pp. 8-18.</note>by the <persName key="
Gleig, Rev.G.R.">Rev. G. R.
Gleig</persName>, a former chaplain of the Hospital, but now Chaplain
General of the Forces:-</p>
  <p>" In ancient times the recompense of military merit was
everywhere the same,-namely, donations of money or land,
or both, proportionate in extent and value to the rank and
services of the meritorious warrior. Under free Govern-
ments, or such as had once been free, soldiers of every class
partook in the State's bounty.  The Athenians, besides
maintaining out of the public fund all disabled and wounded
soldiers, took care of the parents and children of such as fell
in battle; while the Romans settled their discharged legion-
aries in villages, called colonies, where each man occupied a
farm on a sort of military tenure, perfectly independent of
all the world besides. In like manner, the followers of those
barbarous chiefs before whose might the colossal power of
<placeName key="Rome">Rome</placeName> gave way, received, as the recompense of their valour,
glebes or fields, which they cultivated for their own use, and






<pb id="p.130" n="130"/>

bequeathed to their children, subject only to such conditions
as a regard to the welfare of the community might impose.
But the Northern barbarians came, as the Romans had done
before them, into lands where equal rights were unknown,
and practices, often loosely attributed to the feudal system,
prevailed  ...     There grew up everywhere arrange-
ments in social life, which in due time cut off the common
soldier from all participation in the rewards which had
heretofore been bestowed equally upon him and upon his
leader.</p>
  <p>" Under the feudal system, as it showed itself in the days
of <persName key="Conqueror, William the">William the Conqueror</persName>, the possession of land continued
to be the great object of ambition; and <persName key="Conqueror, William the">William</persName> was very
liberal in his grants of lordships and manors to the chiefs
who aided him in his contest with <persName key="Harold">Harold</persName>.   It was on
knights and barons, however, and on them alone, that these
rich prizes were bestowed; for of the private soldiers no
heed was taken, except, indeed, that each baron, attaching a
certain portion of these to his own fortunes, carried them
down to his estate, and used them there, as soon as the army
broke up, as instruments for oppressing and plundering his
neighbours.  In like manner, during the unsettled and
turbulent reigns of many of the succeeding monarchs,
though estates continually changed their owners, they
passed only from one great chief to another; for the spirit
of feudalism was entirely opposed to the subdivision of
land; and in that species of spoil, as it came day by day to
be disposed of, the leaders of armies or the heads of factions
alone took part. Yet were the followers of these rapacious
barons far from suffering neglect. The supreme govern-
ment, indeed, knew them not,-for the supreme government
dealt only with persons who were in a condition to bring
certain proportions of horse and foot into the field; but the
baron himself was induced, both by honour and self-interest,





                 <pb id="p.131" n="131"/>

to provide for the old age of such as had served him faith-
fully. Many common soldiers became, therefore, hangers-on
about the castle, - foresters, dog-feeders, hawk-trainers,
seneschals, &#x0026;c.; while others fell back into the station of
serfs, and, cultivating the soil for their lord's benefit,
received out of its produce the sort of sustenance to which
in early life they had been accustomed.     ...     In
exact proportion to the decay of the feeling of mutual pro-
tection and allegiance which originally bound the lord to his
tenant and the tenant to his lord, was the worn-out soldier
cut off from the sources of established support which had
been accessible to his ancestors. It is true that the convent
door still stood open, and there, especially if he had served
against the Infidels, an alms was freely given. But casual
charity, however frequent, could furnish no compensation
for the loss of a maintenance which every change in the
manners of society rendered more and more insecure; for
not only the effects of a growing commerce, which diffused
wealth more and more equally through the different classes,
but the spirit of chivalry itself, strange as the assertion may
sound, was all against the private soldier. .</p>
  <p>"Of any systematic plan for the relief of wounded or
discharged soldiers, from the downfall of the feudal system
up to<persName key=" Elizabeth"> Elizabeth's</persName> reign, I cannot discover a trace. Occa-
sional instances of Royal bounty are indeed recorded; as, for
example, in the reign of <persName key="Edward IV">Edward IV</persName>., when grants were
made to private soldiers,-one to <persName key="Sclatter, John">John Sclatter</persName>, being an
annuity of four marks as a compensation for the loss of his
hand at the battle of <placeName key="Wakefield">Wakefield</placeName>,-the other to <persName key="Vesgreat, Rauf">Rauf Ves-
tynden</persName>, a pension of ten pounds, by letters patent under the
great seal, till he should obtain some permanent office. The
latter, which, considering the value of money at the time,
was a very handsome provision, is stated in the patent as
having been bestowed ' for the good and agreeable service






<pb id="p.132" n="132"/>

which he did unto us in berying and holdyng our standard
of the black bull at the battle of <placeName key="Sherborne">Sherborne</placeName>.' But such
occurrences were probably rare; at all events, chroniclers
take no notice of them.</p>
   <p>"With the reign of <persName key="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName> we open out, as it were, a
new era in the history of this country. In the first place,
England then began to play a more conspicuous part in the
game of European politics than she had yet done since the
days of her Edwards; and her armaments, both by sea and
land, were consequently on a larger scale. In the next
place, the work of the Reformation being completed, amid
the unsparing plunder of the property of the <orgName key="Church">Church</orgName>, some
evils were felt to accompany the benefits thence arising.
The suppression of the monasteries, and the transference of
a large portion of the tithes to lay impropriators, placed the
clergy and the great body of the people in a new relation
one towards another. The former were no longer in a
condition to bestow those abundant alms, on which the
latter had, doubtless, too much depended; and the latter,
unable either to find employment or to subsist without it,
suffered severe privations. For great changes had for some
time been carried forward in the system of culture and
general management of the soil, which consolidating occupa-
tions and enclosing commons, had reduced multitudes of the
peasantry to a state of absolute pauperism. These being cut
off from their last resource, the priests' bounty, became
desperate; insomuch that Parliament found it necessary to
institute a system of compulsory relief, out of which,
however humanely it might have been intended, enormous
evils unquestionably arose. With the country in such a
state, it would have been both impolitic and cruel to exclude
the discharged soldier from the same kind of assistance
which was awarded to the destitute peasant. Accordingly,
by statute 43 of this reign, 'the majority of the justices of





          .        <pb id="p.133" n="133"/>

the peace in their Easter sessions had power to charge every
parish towards a weekly relief of maimed soldiers and
mariners, so that no parish should pay weekly above ten-
pence, or below twopence; nor any county which consisted
of above fifty parishes to pay more than sixpence, one parish
with another; which sums so taxed were to be assessed in
every parish by the parishioners,-or, in default, by the
churchwardens and constables,-or, in their default, by the
next justice or justices of peace.' . . .<note place="foot" n="2">Grose's Military Antiquities.</note> Such is the substance
of the Act of <orgName key=" Parliament">Parliament</orgName> which first gave to the wounded
and war-worn soldier a legal claim upon the bounty of his
countrymen. It will be seen, however, that the footing on
which it placed him was not of a nature to raise him in his
own estimation, or in that of the people generally. He was
treated as a pauper-not as one who had served his king, or
shed his blood in defence of the land which doled out its
unwilling alms to keep him from starving. Yet were the
provisions thus made very imperfectly applied.  With
Elizabeth, indeed, expired for a time the martial feeling both
of the court and the people; and old soldiers, like things out
of date, were cast aside and forgotten.</p>
  <p>" The reign of <persName key="James ">James </persName>was a peaceable one, and its dura-
tion-two-and-twenty years-sufficed to thin the numbers,
at all times inconsiderable, of decayed soldiers in England.
With the accession of <persName key="Charles the First">Charles the First</persName>, a different prospect
opened. First, his foreign wars,-if indeed such expeditions
as those to <placeName key="Cadiz">Cadiz</placeName> and <placeName key="Rochelle">Rochelle</placeName> deserve the name,-and
latterly, the terrible struggle in which he engaged with his
Parliament, put arms into the hands of a large portion of the
male population throughout the kingdom. Yet the Royal
exchequer was from the beginning to the end of the contest
so thoroughly impoverished, that not only was the king
unable to provide for his wounded and disabled adherents,






<pb id="p.134" n="134"/>

but the means of paying the troops actually in the field were
generally wanting.  It was not so with the Parliament.
Wielding a large share of the authority, and having com-
plete command over the resources of the nation, that body
was enabled to act in a more liberal spirit. Accordingly, on
the <date value="1643-03-06"> 6th of March,1643</date>, an Act was passed for the relief of
maimed soldiers, as well as of the widows and orphans of
men slain in battle, by imposing upon the parishes from
which such soldiers might have enlisted a tax or assessment
adequate to the necessity of each case. Such tax was to be
levied by the same process and under the same authority as
a poor-rate; and care was of course to be taken that none
should derive benefit from it except those who, in their own
persons, or by their husbands or fathers, had served the
cause of the people against the Sovereign.</p>
 <p> " Whatever might be the situation of the Parliamentary
invalids, <persName key="Charles the Second">Charles the Second</persName> found, on reascending the
throne of his ancestors, that the men who had followed his
father's fortunes and suffered wounds in his cause were
everywhere turned loose to beg their bread. Careless, but
not wholly destitute of heart, the King early adopted
measures with a view of bettering their condition as far
as his limited means would allow, and passed, in the twelfth
year of his reign, an Act which secured to discharged
soldiers certain immunities. Such of them as had been
apprentices were permitted to exercise the trades to which
they were bound, even if they had failed to serve out their
time; while others were authorized to follow, in any town
or place within their native counties, any occupations for
which they might be fitted. But to give a starving man
leave to follow a regular calling, without at the same time
furnishing him with means to begin business, is to con-
tribute in a very slender degree to the amelioration of his
Fortunes. In spite of this well-intended law, and of the old





        <pb id="p.135" n="135"/>

statute of<persName key=" Elizabeth"> Elizabeth</persName>, which still continued in force, both
town and country swarmed with mendicants, almost all of
whom, many doubtless unfairly, represented themselves as
decayed loyalists. It was at this juncture that the circum-
stance is said to have befallen, [which led to the formation
of <orgName key="Chelsea Hospital">Chelsea Hospital</orgName>]."

<p>  "Begun on a scale of great magnificence by its gifted

went on so slowly, that neither <persName key="Charles II">Charles</persName> nor <persName key="James">James</persName> enjoyed

which he represented the edifice as capable of accommodating
416 men, with a governor, chaplain, curate, physician,
secretary, treasurer, housekeeper, and 16 matrons. But
the views of the King's Government extended much beyond
this.</p>
  <p>" I have never been able to ascertain the exact date at
which the veterans took possession of their new abode.
That some of them were domiciled in <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> during the
latter part of the reign of <persName key="James II">James II</persName>. seems, however, to be
proved by the fact, that the covering for the altar, pulpit,
and desk in the chapel, as well as the magnificent com-
munion plate and black-letter Prayer-books which belong to
it, were the gift of that monarch. Nor are traditions wanting
relative to the efforts made by the King to bring back his
decayed soldiers within the pale of the <orgName key="Church of Rome">Church of Rome</orgName>.
He is said to have paid frequent visits to the Hospital,
appealing first to one and then to another of the inmates,
till a fine old warrior on a certain occasion cut him short in
a manner which he could neither forgive nor resent. 'Why
should not you adopt the religion of your Prince?' said
<persName key="James II">James</persName>. ' Please your Majesty,' was the reply, ' I was once
a Catholic; I then became a Protestant; and I should be
very happy to go back to your Majesty's religion again, only

the next time I changed my creed, I should become a Turk.'
-<persName key="James II">James</persName> was mortally offended at this reply, and ceased to
importune the pensioners farther.</p>
<p>  " While the Hospital was in progress,-that is, from <date value="1682">1682</date>
till the admission of the invalids,-provision seems to have
been made for their support by pensions granted out of the
fund set apart for the purposes of the building. Of these,

while some may be accounted magnificent."</p>

  <p><persName key="Gleig">Mr. Gleig</persName> thus describes the funeral of a Chelsea pen-
sioner:-</p>
  <p>" It rarely happens that, out of a body of 500 invalids,
one or two are not committed every week to the dust; and
Wednesday and Friday being here the canonical days for
interments, you may chance to be present at the ceremony.
Let me, then, assume that we have traversed the inter-
mediate space together, and are standing at this moment at
the extremity of Jew's-row, though prepared, by the simple
operation of throwing our right shoulders forward, to make
good our entrance into the Hospital. See, there is some
operation in progress more important than usual.  The
gates are closed, the guard is turned out, and the sentry
holds the postern in his hand, that he may admit well-
dressed and respectable-looking people, at the same time that
he shuts out the mob. Examine the bearing of these men
closely, and having done so, retain the indifference which on
ordinary occasions may pervade you, if you can. There
are just twelve of them, with a sergeant and a corporal,
of whom three, including the sergeant, have severally lost a
leg; two present each an empty sleeve; and the remainder
are furrowed over by age, and heavily laden with infirmities.
Yet, how erect and steady is their port!  There they
are, with the three-cornered hat of William the Third's day,
surmounting the red frock of a similar date-noble specimens
of what soldiers once were, gallant ruins of men who never
knew in youth what fear was, and are not now likely
to forget what is due to their well-earned reputation. And
observe the sentry at the gate;-how good-humouredly he
repulses the crowd, chiefly of boys, that press upon him,
though his sole weapon be now the staff, which is used
indifferently to command attention, and to support the steps





<pb id="p.144" n="144"/>       .

of him who wields it. But, as I have just said, he has no
orders to exclude well-dressed people, and will not, therefore,
resist our effort to establish ourselves within the barricade, if
such be your desire. Move forward, then, and place yourself
just beyond the guard-house, till the procession, of which
the approach is announced by the roll of the muffled drum
and the shrill notes of the fife, shall have passed. We can
then fall in with the rear, and be witnesses to the ceremonies,
whatever they may be, that attend the funeral of a pen-
sioner.</p>
 <p> "The drum will have been heard some time, and the
well-known air, the <title>149th Psalm</title>, recognised, ere the pro-
cession comes in sight, winding round the angle of the court.
It appears, however, at last, headed by the firing party,
12 veterans, accoutred for the occasion in old black waist-
belts, from which, in the rear, depend old bayonets, and to
which, in front, are fastened old cartouche-boxes. Their
muskets, somewhat the worse for wear, and stripped of the
slings which formerly attached to them, are reversed, not
perhaps with the nicety which a firing party from the
Grenadier Guards might display, but after a fashion which
sufficiently indicates that the old men have not forgotten the
lessons learned in early youth. The tread of the men them-
selves, likewise, is orderly; and they are commanded by a
sergeant, who marches behind the rearmost file, with his
partisan or halbert reversed. Next to the firing party move
the drummer and fifer, 2 feeble grey-headed men, in whom
it would be difficult to recognise the relics of the light-
hearted lads whose merry music has startled many a maiden
from her broken slumbers, and called her to the window
that she might look her last at some favourite partner in the
dance, or, it may be, at one who had established still
stronger claims upon her memory. And now come the
chaplain and his clerk, of whom it would be unbecoming in




                 <pb id="p.145" n="145"/>

me to say more than that both have seen some service, and
that both carry about in their own persons sensible proofs
that where there is service there is usually danger. These,
again, are succeeded by the coffin, which being covered with
a black pall, and surmounted by the hat of the deceased,-
the single military trophy of which his latter days could
boast,-is borne on the shoulders of six of his comrades.
His relatives, if he have any, now fall into their places; the
nurses who attended him in his last illness succeed, and the
whole procession is closed by the inmates of his ward, among
whom it rarely occurs that he had not one or more intimate
and familiar friends.</p>
  <p>"As the closing files pass the grave-yard doorway, we
attach ourselves to the little column, and are introduced into
an open area, oblong in shape, totally devoid of ornament,
and fenced about with lofty brick-built walls. Not yet,
however, have we leisure to look round; for the procession
having advanced about half way towards its further ex.
tremity, defiles somewhat to the right, and halts beside a
mound of fresh earth. Here, at the foot of the grave, the
clergyman takes his station; while the firing party form line
along its edge, leaving, however, space enough between for
those whose business it may be to lower the coffin into the
dust.  Meanwhile the mourners, including nurses and
pensioners, in attendance, arrange themselves in a sort of
half-circle about the grave. And now the chaplain, raising
his hat, begins the service, during the progress of which
you cannot better employ yourself than by looking round
upon the countenances of his audience. But the service is
not of long continuance. The chaplain has ceased to speak.
The coffin is lowered into the grave, earth is consigned to
earth, dust to dust, ashes to ashes. And now, the sergeant,
taking a pace to the front, gives the word of command, and
his party come to attention, shoulder their arms, and present.

<p>  A further evidence of the service of these veterans is
always to be obtained in the number of clasps which they
wear, each clasp denotirg a battle in which the wearer
served. Several of the Chelsea pensioners have from 3 to 7
clasps, a few  have 8 and 9, and one or two have 11.
Scarcely one man of the whole body considers, moreover,
that he has his right number of clasps, but reckons that he
is short one, two, or three. The majority are those with 3
clasps and under, and some have none at all, their service
having been in the early Indian war, for which no medals
were given to the survivors. At the Duke's funeral, as far
as it was practicable, none of the 83 chosen to follow his
remains had less than 3 clasps, although great regard was
obliged to be had to the likelihood of their being able
to bear the fatigue of the day.

and all shades of religious opinions. All who have served
in the British infantry or cavalry 21 or 24 years, if regularly
discharged with a pension at the end of that service, or half
that time if disabled in active service, are eligible for the
Hospital, no matter what their country or religion may be.
Not many years ago an Egyptian occupied a berth in the
College. Germans have been common. There was, only a

 <p> The very heavy manner in which time hangs on their
hands should also be a great inducement to Christian persons
to seek to interest them profitably. They really often scarcely
know what to do with themselves, and almost anything
in the way of conversation is a relief. How powerful for
good impression is such a circumstance! In visiting other
classes of the population the difficulty is to get at them, and
to find them at leisure, so that religious instruction may be
seasonably given. There is no difficulty in this respect with
pensioners.</p>

  <p>As a resource against ennui, and as a restraint from a too
frequent visit to the public-house, card-tables were intro-
duced some years since by those in authority at the Hospital,
in a separate room, well furnished with benches, stove, &amp;c.
Dominoes, and similar games, to while away the time, are
also encouraged, although the stakes played for are of course
small.  Christian efforts might surely be made also to
interest them, and with far better results, than games first

                </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Library, and its Defects" id="c2s48"><head> Library, and its Defects.</head>
 <p> For the same purpose a library is provided, the exclusive
property of the pensioners. A ticket of admission from the
chaplain is required, and no book may be taken out of the
room, except in cases of severe illness. Travels, voyages,
and military narratives are favourite books. The better
novels are also popular with them. Here, also, it is seen
how much of benefit, with good counsel from a Christian
friend, with whom they can make familiar, their love of
reading may be directed to their profit, and to the further-
ance of their best interests. But an old-fashioned arrange-
ment tends very greatly to interfere with the benefit which
the library might otherwise more fully confer. It contains
many excellent books, but the pensioners are old and infirm,
and their sight is weak. In the long winter evenings, so
favourable for reading, the library would be much more
resorted to, but it has no gas, nor is even a candle permitted.
The old oil lamps give so dim and misty a light, that the
library is quite useless to them practically when it would be
most serviceable.  It certainly would greatly add to their
comfort, and, it may be hoped, to their profit too, if they
received the advantage of modern invention, and had the
benefit of gas, considered by practical men as even less
dangerous to the safety of buildings than oil.

 <p> The same benevolent object which led to the new smoking-
room, with its games of chance, and the library, has also
recently given to the pensioners separate small plots of
ground to cultivate. If <persName key="Adam">Adam</persName> in a state of innocence had

similar employment should be found.  For this valuable

<p>  It is a circumstance also not to be passed over without a
thought, that these very gardens now so devoted were the
celebrated <placeName key="Ranelagh">Ranelagh</placeName>-the resort of fashion, gaiety, and wit-
in the last century. Not more remarkable is the change in
the gardens than in the Hospital itself; when it became
a college of peace to soldiers after the use of the material
sword, instead of a college for polemic warfare to divines.
To these gardens resorted the gay world of the eighteenth
century for dancing and music, and too frequently for display
of person and dress, and, it is to be feared, in many cases for
still worse purposes of folly and sin. Here, appropriately
enough, Fielding makes his " Amelia" to have been ruined,
and here "The Connoisseur," among our essayists, and
<persName key="Bloomfield">Bloomfield,</persName> among our poets, found subjects for their satire.
Nature and art combining their powers here caused <persName key="

coup d'oeil he had ever seen." But the purposes to which
<placeName key="Ranelagh">Ranelagh</placeName> is now devoted, to the benevolent mind presents
still more attractive features of beauty, although the

  <p>It may also be observed, that even the other inmates of
<orgName key="Chesea Hospital">Chelsea Hospital</orgName> are almost, without exception, connected
in some way or other with pensioners, so that all efforts

this particular class. Formerly great abuses existed in this
respect. Almost every post in the Hospital was filled with
superannuated servants or other less respectable hangers-on
about the families of paymasters-general. These posts were
also often rewards for election favours. <persName key="Russell, Lord John">Lord John\nRussell</persName>
was the first paymaster-general who put a stop to this
corrupt system. The nurses now are wives of in-pensioners,
or widows of soldiers, and in almost every other office,-

large-amount of immorality, even at <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>, in the old

<p>  At one period it used to be said, " the greater the rogue,

But great improvements have taken place. It is to be

events, there are now many privates who are men very
respectable in their own station.</p>
  <p>The testimony of <persName key="Gleig">Mr. Gleig</persName>, with reference to <orgName key="Chelsea Hospital">Chelsea Hospital</orgName>
, is,-" He who writes can testify, that nowhere are





                 <pb id="p.155" n="155"/>

the visits of one who comes with a message of peace more
thankfully received or more gratefully acknowledged."</p>
  <p>The same testimony is borne by those who have, as lay
agents, sought to supplement the efforts of the chaplain.
One gentleman is employed in the Hospital for two days in
the week, and meets everywhere with a ready acceptance.
A City missionary, who is in the habit of visiting the Hos-
pital periodically, also state-,--" Several times, when I have
been ill, some of these old men, in their best red coats, have
found their way to my house, to try, in rather a clumsy
way, to comfort me. Only last week, being unwell, a friend
took for me my meeting. An old pensioner, whom I met
afterwards, said to me, ' I began to think you were ill, and
I was just coming off to see you.' Nothing can exceed the
kind manner in which some of them inquire after my poor
sickly wife, when she is too ill to attend the meetings. And
a few weeks before this, one of the old men sent for me to
ask me whether I could give him my card, that he might
apply to me if he was taken ill, as he had a little money
which he had saved, and he would like me to convey it to
the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName>, not being able to trust it, as he
said, with others." The soldiers' missionary of this Society,
visiting occasionally the Hospital, when unwell some time
since, although living many miles off, was visited by some
of the pensioners on a bleak, cold day, with snow, several
inches deep, on the ground, for the purpose of inquiring
after him.</p>

         </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Their Interest in Religious Tracts" id="c2s56"><head>   Their Interest in Religious Tracts.</head>
  <p>So, with reference to religious tracts, the same missionary
states, that he now scarcely ever has a refusal, while he is
often "complimented by them on his anxiety to do such
reprobates as themselves good."  The word, "reprobates," is
a favourite one with them, to characterize their own disposi-
tions and habits. The other missionary states,-" In the





<pb id="p.156" n="156"/>

spring of the year, between 300 and 400 pensioners
assemble in the College grounds for parade, from 6 to 12
days, when opportunities occur to converse with them and
distribute tracts among them. I have often observed how
readily they have received the tracts, and, when mounted on
an omnibus, on my return home, I have often observed the
old men reading the tracts I have given them." He adds, " I
have often felt sorry that the claims of my own district would
not allow me to make greater efforts to benefit these men."
</p>
           </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Their Desire of Further Instruction" id="c2s57"><head> Their Desire of Further Instruction.</head>
 <p> The old men themselves would exceedingly like to have a
missionary of their own, as do the Greenwich pensioners.
"No heathens in the world," said one of them recently,
" need a missionary more than the men in <orgName key="Chelsea Hospital">Chelsea Hospital</orgName>."
Two of the missionaries of that Society spend about 3 hours
a week in the building, and the soldiers' missionary also
occasionally gives a call. But this is quite insufficient. One
of these faithful visitors states,-" Sometimes I meet enfeebled
old men, who appear very anxious to be instructed; and
these will sometimes say, ' Can a man who has shed the
blood of others ever be forgiven ?' and when I tell them that
Christ is able to save to the very utmost, the big tear will
run down their furrowed cheeks, and they will grasp my
hand with considerable earnestness. Sometimes more than a
month passes before I visit a second time in a ward, and
then I find some poor man has passed into eternity who,
when I visited him last, entreated of me to come more
frequently, as he had no one to whom he could freely
speak."

them follow trades in addition to their small pension. They
generally live in very low parts of London, for the sake of
cheapness, and they change about their residences even more
than the working classes in general. They receive religious
instruction, when it happens that they live where this is
given from house to house, but they live very often in
localities to which it has not extended. As they wait about
long in receiving their pay, they may then be met with very
advantageously with this design, and a faithful friend may
often drop a word which will prevent the money, when
received, being taken direct to the public-house, instead of
being more profitably employed. It is truly painful to behold
the number of loose women and idle men, waiting outside
the pay-office, to make a prey of one after another of the

  <p>The following brief extracts from the Reports of one of

both the benefit of very partial visitation of the Hospital,
and the great importance of more systematic and extensive

the least idea of publicity being given to the extracts:-</p>
  <p>Report, <date value="1850">1850</date>. " It is as painful to contemplate the hardened
indifference of many of these old men, as it is encouraging to
observe the workings of Divine grace in others. Several of
them, on their death-beds, in my hearing, have blessed the
Lord that they were visited by a missionary. The College
is, in fact, a most important sphere of Christian labour, but
the visiting it once a-week is not often enough. An old man
on one visit appears impressed; and on my next visit, when
I inquire for him, I am told, 'He is dead, Sir.' This has
happened to me on several occasions."</p>
  <p><date value="1851">1851</date>. "I still continue to visit the old pensioners in the
College. Several have been led by these visits to attend the
meetings in my district, as that is not very far distant, and
from that they have been induced by me to attend public
worship. Some few, I hope, have died with a hope of
heaven; while others, who still survive, welcome me as
'their old friend.' One of the pensioners leads the singing
at the meeting, and I sometimes call on another of them to
pray. It is pleasing to hear him thank the Lord for pre-
serving him in the dangers of war, and implore that he may
now be preserved from still worse dangers from spiritual foes

at home. It is utterly impossible to visit between 500 and 600
persons in 3 hours each week, so as to give attention to any
extent to individual cases. This prevents my following out
cases, so as to draw any such sketch of them as demands
continuous observation and watching. The College itself
would furnish sufficient work for two missionaries. At least,
one ought to be employed among so important a class of per-
sons, who are also so very accessible to religious instruction."</p>

I have seen more than 20 drunk together on Saturday

London is most legitimately entitled to ask the aid of country
towns on behalf of her residents.</p>
  <p>There are very few classes of persons, however, to the
religious comfort and instruction of whom, in their old age,
Christian persons can provide, with an equal measure of
delightful satisfaction that they are doing what is pre-
eminently an act of justice no less than mercy.  How
much does the nation owe to them, and every individual
person as a part of the nation ! Have they not fought our
battles ? They kept off our foes-they preserved our homes,
our property, and our lives-we owe to them the liberty

 <p> We hope that the love of war which was once so common
in this country has now generally ceased, that a better state
of feeling has become prevalent, and that the true genius of
our holy religion has in this respect more entirely pervaded
the national mind. We believe such is the case, and we
thank God for it. The horrors of war are fearful in the
extreme. But one especial means by which we may testify
our thankfulness for peace, and improve its existence and
long continuance, is by being mindful of the best interests of
those who are collected within our metropolis as objects of
national gratitude, now that they have laid down their
weapons of war through the feebleness of their arms by
age.  Shall we not seek to render the national refuge
provided for them in a season of peace and security, a
blessing to them in the best of senses, and to avail ourselves
of the leisure granted to them, to point their attention, now
that they are tottering on the grave, to a better world ?

whose means quite precluded them from such a cost, might
now for a very small sum hire the accommodation. Pride
rather than convenience, however, was supposed to be the
main motive, for some period, to the use of the hired
carriage. It was then accounted as something very grand
to ride in a coach; so that when " two leash of oyster-wives

  <p>For some 200 years hackney-coaches had their day, but

now they are wholly and probably for ever gone. During
that long period, they "passed through all their phases of
dirt and discomfort; the springs growing weaker, the 'iron

all noblemen's and gentlemen's disused family coaches, which
had been handed over to the coachmaker when a new
carriage was made. But it was not long that these coaches
retained the comfort and cleanliness that might distinguish
them, when first introduced to the stand. The horses were
.... sorry jades, sometimes cripples, and the harness looked
as frail as the carriages. The exceptions to this description
were few, for the hackney-coachmen possessed a monopoly,
and thought it unchangeable. They were of the same class
of men-nearly all gentlemen's servants, or their sons. The
obtaining of a license for a hackney-coachman was generally
done through interest. It was one way in which many peers
and Members of Parliament provided for any favourite
servant, or for the servant of a friend."</p>

<p>  "Messrs. Bradshaw and Rotch, however, did manage, in
<date value="1823">1823</date>, to obtain licenses for 12 cabriolets, starting them at
8d. a mile, the hackney-coach fare being Is. The number
was subsequently increased to 50, and then to 100, and in
less than 9 years after the first cab placed in the streets of
London, all restriction as to their number was abolished.
The form of a cab first in use was that of a hooded chaise,
the leather head or hood being raised or lowered at pleasure.
In wet windy weather, however, it was found, when raised,
to present so great a resistance to the progress of the horse,
that the hood was abolished. In these cabs, the driver sat
inside, the vehicle being made large enough to hold 2
persons and the cabman. The next kind had a detached
seat for the driver, alongside his fare. On the third sort
the driver occupied the roof, the door opening at the back.
. . The ' covered cab,' carrying 2 inside, with the driver on
a box in front, was next introduced, and it was a safer con-
veyance, having 4 wheels, the preceding cabs having had
but 2. The Clarences, carrying 4 inside, came next; and
almost at the same time with them, the Hansoms.

connected with the hackney carriage business of the metro-

up during that period. On  <date value="1852-12-31">December 31st,1852</date>, there
were 3,593 licensed metropolitan cabs. The number of
licensed cab-drivers was 6,388, and of licensed watermen

  <p>There can be no question that this rapid increase in the
number of London cabs has very greatly promoted the
comfort and added to the convenience of the London popu-
lation. But, as a class, cab-drivers are far behind most
others in their moral and religious habits, and they have
received, to the present time, a very small measure indeed
of the attention of those who have shown themselves in the
most praiseworthy manner ready in deeds of benevolence
towards classes, the claim of whom on their regard and aid
is perhaps far less strong.</p>
  <p>As compared, indeed, with the old hackney-coachmen of
30 years since, the cab-drivers of the present day are in
many respects a different class of men. In speed and
alacrity they are the very opposites of their predecessors,
with their 4 or 5 miles an hour pace. The old hackney-
coachmen were accustomed to spend regularly 7s. a-day in
eating and drinking ! An old hand thus described the daily
course of himself and comrades, apparently with entire truth,
to the compiler of "Labour and the Poor."   "Breakfast
ls., good tea and good bread and butter, as much as you
liked, always with a glass of rum in the last cup, for the
'lacing ' of it. Always rum, gin weren't so much run after
then. Dinner was ls. 6d., a cut off some good joint; beer
was included at some places, and not at others. Any extras
to follow was extra to pay. Two glasses of rum and water
after dinner, ls., pipes found, and most of us found our own
baccy-boxes. Tea same as breakfast, and 'laced' ditto.
Supper the same as dinner, or 6d. less, and the rest to make






<pb id="p.172" n="172"/>
up 7s. went for odd glasses of ale or 'short' (neat spirits).
Take day and night, and 1,200 of us was out, and perhaps
every man spent his 7s." So that the 1,200 old hackney-
coachmen spent no less in their own eating and drinking
than 4201. a-day, 2,940l. a-week, and 152,880l. a-year.
How sad an illustration did they present of low animal
life. They were also as ignorant as they were self-indulgent.
Very few of them could read or write. They seemed, in
fact, only to care for the body, and for the present moment.</p>
  <p>The cabmen of the present day are considered by the
public in general to be a degraded, profligate class of persons.
They are well aware that this is the opinion generally
entertained of them, and every man's hand being, as they
believe, against them, their hand is against every man's in
return. To this there are, however, of course many honour-
able exceptions. But the very extensive prevalence of the
feeling referred to renders them in a peculiar manner
susceptible of the manifestation of kindness. It is the more
appreciated by them from the fact that they so seldom meet
with it. They are consequently as a class very ready to
listen to the counsel and instruction of a Christian visitor,
whose soul commiserates with them in their particular
difficulties, and is filled with zeal and love for their best
interests. The world has been as loud in finding fault with
this class of the community as the Church has been silent in
presenting to them the grand remedy for every disorder,
entrusted to its own keeping to trade with till its Lord's
return. They have been almost wholly neglected.

</div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="The extensive Use of London Cabs on Sundays, and its injurious Effects on the Drivers" id="c3s16"><head>The extensive Use of London Cabs on Sundays, and its
              injurious Effects on the Drivers.</head>
   <p>There are 3 especial difficulties in the way of the moral
and religious improvement of this class of the population. The
first of these is that they have no Sabbath. Most of them





               <pb id="p.173" n="173"/>

are employed as drivers by proprietors, who will not allow
of their ceasing work on that day.  They must either
relinquish their situations, or violate the sanctity of that
holy day. And yet Sunday is by far the least profitable day
of the seven to the cab proprietor. This is so fully admitted
that a less amount of money is required by him to be
brought home then than on other days, notwithstanding
which more drivers are discharged on Sundays than during
the week, for not being able to bring home the required
amount which is expected from them. There is a general
feeling on the part of cab-drivers that it is a degradation to
them to be employed on Sundays. Although they very
seldom recognise the fact of the holy character of the day as
a day especially to be devoted to religious improvement and
the worship and service of God, they yet are most averse to
being employed on that day in their worldly callings. Their
customers, moreover, on that day are either pleasure-takers
or professedly religious persons, and it is generally con-
sidered that the custom of the latter is even greater than
that of the former, while it is also more steady and regular
throughout the year. Persons who have not mixed inti-
mately with the drivers of cabs can scarcely imagine the
stumbling-block which this presents to their favourable
regard of the claims of the Gospel. They entertain the
idea that, if it were not for religious people, they would have
their Sundays, as they believe that it would not otherwise
be worth their masters' while to send them out on that day,
except under special circumstances. So strongly does this
circumstance produce an antipathy to religious persons on
the part of cabmen, that some will even try to avoid taking
fares to churches and chapels, simply because of their dis-
gust at the practice of persons professing to be religious
employing them for such purposes. The manner in which
cabmen in general, in their intercourse with each other,
swear at religious people, and especially at Christian






<pb id="p.174" n="174"/>

ministers, as a sort of humbugs, is most awful to listen to,
according to the testimony of those who are in a position to
hear it. No words are too bad in their vocabulary, where-
with they curse them. Sometimes, when religious people
hire cabs to take them to church, they will say to the driver,
as they get out, probably to relieve their conscience for the
act, "We hope you attend some place of public worship."
It is related in a recent pamphlet, entitled, " The Omnibus
Men of London," that a cab-driver not long since answered
a lady who thus addressed him, "No, ma'am, we drives
about such as you."  When cabmen are expostulated with
by other religious persons, who avoid Sunday riding them-
selves, on the evil of their violation of the Sabbath, their
common reply is, that there can be no more harm in their
driving their cabs than in religious persons riding in them.
Thus they justify themselves in their sin.    And   so
decided is their impression against religious persons on
account of it, that they may often be heard to say that the
sound of the church bells makes them unhappy. It operates
also prejudicially on their minds, that harder bargains are
generally made with them by religious persons who ride in
cabs on Sundays than by pleasure-takers. Indeed, cabmen
in general lay it down as a truism that parsons are their
worst customers, whether on Sundays or on other days.
They place them even before lawyers in this respect. The
missionary of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName> employed among
cabmen, was accustomed, when he first began his work of
visiting the stands, to wear a white neckcloth. But he soon
found that they mistook him from this circumstance for a
minister, and that they would give no heed whatever to
what he said. But on going among them subsequently with
a black handkerchief the difference of his reception was
almost incredible.  He has always since found it most
important to retain the latter dress. There are occasions
on which it is possible much may be said for, as well as





                                <pb id="p.175" n="175"/>

against the use of cabs on Sundays, to convey Christian
people to the house of God, and especially those who have
to conduct these services, and whose residences are un-
avoidably at a distance. But in the great mass of cases, it
admits of no defence, and the writer believes that if the fact
were known, of the extreme injury which is actually done
(whether rightly or not it matters not to inquire) to the
mind of the cab-driver by the practice, Christian persons
would feel they could no longer conscientiously be parties to
it, but would submit to even a large amount of personal
inconvenience to avoid it. The strong feeling of London
cabmen with reference to Sunday work is shown in between
2,000 and 3,000 of them having this year signed a petition
against the opening of the Crystal Palace on the Lord's-day.</p>
</div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="The Extortion complained of in Cabmen" id="c3s17"><head>
         The Extortion complained of in Cabmen.</head>
 <p> A second snare to which cabmen are especially exposed is
that of extortion, and they are exposed to great opprobrium
from the public on this account. The practice cannot be
justified, but the public frequently do not sufficiently con-
sider the difficulty of the temptation, and they are too severe
in their condemnation of the drivers as a class. It may
therefore be desirable to explain their position. The public
entertain the impression that the present fares, and especially
with the small additions often made to them, leave a large
profit. But such does not appear to be the case, and
although efforts have been made to establish a company, the
fares of whose cabs should be only 6d. a mile, they do not
appear to have succeeded, and the general impression among
practical men in the trade is that, even if a greatly increased
trade was produced thereby, the price would not be remu-
nerative. The cost of a good clarence cab is from 40l. to
501., of a good horse to draw it from 18l. to 201., and of
harness from 4l. 10s. to 51. The license to the cab pro-





<pb id="p.176" n="176"/>

prietor costs 51., and the duty on the cab is 10s. every week,
to be paid in advance. The cab-driver has also to pay for
a license 5s. a-year. The liability of being taken a long
way from home, without being able to get a fare back, and
the long time which will frequently elapse between one fare
and another, with the maintenance of the horse, the cost of
stabling, and the wear and tear of the cab render it a some-
what expensive matter to embark and maintain a cab. The
great majority of cabs are driven by men employed by cab
proprietors, and it is reckoned in the trade that less than
14s. brought home daily by the driver in the season, and
about 9s. out of the season,<note place="foot" n="1">The cabman's season is from April or May till July or August.
There is a great difference in the amount of earnings during different
parts of the year, although latterly the winter months have somewhat
improved, and the season has gradually become later.</note> will not be remunerative; and
to earn this it is necessary for 2 horses to be employed, and
for the driver to return home from wherever he may be
taken by his fare twice during the day.   For this sum
the driver is required by the proprietor to " sign," as it is
termed, and he is held responsible for the amount, whether
he earns it or not, having, on the other hand, any excess of
this amount which he may happen to earn as his own
perquisite, and which constitutes the entire of his remunera-
tion, as he receives no wages. Some of the less respectable
proprietors, who are called "contractors," and who are
generally Jews, require the drivers to sign for 16s. and 12s.
a-week, according to the season. But the present fares
strictly adhered to, it is generally considered by practical
men, would scarcely allow even the former sums to be
obtained, one day with another. The force of competition, and
the hope of receiving some trifling addition to the legal amount
in some of the fares, induce the drivers, however, to incur
the risk. As a body, the difficulty which they experience in







                           <pb id="p.177" n="177"/>

obtaining a living after making up the amount for which
they are answerable, a default in the payment of which
loses them their places, and exposes them to the penalty of
fine and imprisonment, more frequently leads to the demand
of 6d. or ls. more than is legally due, than the desire
to make undue gain or take unfair advantage of the public,
although the public are disposed to accuse them somewhat
hastily of the latter.

</div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="The unlicensed Driver, and the extreme Depravity of this Class" id="c3s18"><head>The unlicensed Driver, and the extreme Depravity of this
                          Class.</head>
<p>  A third circumstance, which has given a very evil name
to cabmen in general, on the part of the public, is a class of
men, who, though dismissed from their body, are yet much
mixed up with it. These are cabmen who have been
deprived of their licenses for drunkenness or bad conduct.
The law, in kindness to the licensed cab-driver, allows him,
in case of need, to employ an unlicensed substitute for a
period not longer than 24 hours, and by this means these
discharged men get to drive licensed cabs. This is especially
the case with the cabs of what are called " long-day men,"
-for the cab-drivers are divided into several distinct classes,
according to the number and character of the hours during
which they ply for hire, and there are, consequently, the
long-day men; the morning men, who are out from 7 A.M. to
6 P.M.; the long-night men, who are out from 6 P.M. to
10 A.M.; and the short-night men, who are out from 6 P.M.
to 6 A.M. The long-day men (and it is they chiefly who
are employed by the contractors) leave the stables at 9 or 10
in the morning, and do not return home till 12 or 1, or, in
some cases, till 4 or 5, or even later, the next morning.
These hours are more than one man can well endure, and
he is therefore glad to avail himself of the help of the
unlicensed driver towards the end of the day, or while he is






<pb id="p.178" n="178"/>

at his meals.    There is also employment for these
discarded men on the stands, and the licensed driver is
ordinarily glad to give them the sixpence they expect from
each driver for cleaning up the cab and harness, which
otherwise he would have to do himself. Their mode of
life is correctly sketched in the following extract:--" They
usually loiter about the watering-houses (as the public-houses
are called) of the cab-stands, and pass most of their time in
the tap-rooms.  They are mostly of intemperate habits,
being usually 'confirmed sots.'  Very few of them  are
married men. They have been what is termed fancy men
in their prime, but, to use the words of one of the craft,
''got turned up.' They seldom sleep in a bed. Some few
have a bed-room in some obscure part of the town, but the
most of them loll about and doze in the tap-rooms by day,
and sleep in cabs by night. When the watering-house
closes they resort to the night coffee-shops, and pass the
time there till they are wanted as " bucks." <note place="foot" n="1">This is the name given in the trade to cab-drivers who have been
deprived of their licenses</note> When they take
a job for a man they have no regular agreement with the
drivers, but the rule is that they shall do the best they
can. If they take 2s., they give the driver 1s., and keep 1s.
If 1s. 6d., they usually keep only 6d. . . . The regular
driver has no check upon these men, but unless they do well
they never employ them   again..        In the season
some of them will make 2s. or 2s. 6d. a-day by rubbing up,
and it is difficult to say what they make by driving. They
are the most extortionate of all cab-drivers. For 1s. fare
they will usually demand 2s., and for a 3s. fare they will get
5s. or 6s. If the number of the cab is taken, and the legiti-
mate driver summoned, the party overcharged is unable
to swear that the legitimate driver was the individual who
defrauded him, and so the case is dismissed. It is supposed







                              <pb id="p.179" n="179"/>

that the " bucks " make quite as much money as the drivers,
for they're not at all particular how they make their money.
The great majority-99 out of 100-have been in prison,
and many more than once, and they consequently do not
mind about re-visiting gaol. It is calculated that there are
about 800 or 1,000 bucks hanging about the London cab-
stands, and these are mostly regular thieves. If they catch
any person asleep or drunk in a cab, they are sure to have a
dive into his pockets; nor are they particular if the party
belong to their own class, for I am assured that they steal
from one another while dozing in the cabs or tap-rooms."<note place="foot" n="2">"<title> Labour and the Poor.</title>" Letter lxxii. " Morning Chronicle,"
 <date value="1850-10-03">October 3,1850</date></note>
The number of these unlicensed men has since materially
increased, about 700 cab-drivers having been deprived of
their licenses last  (<date value="1852-06">June1852</date>), on the ground of character.
These are now added to the "bucks."   And it illustrates
how many even of the licensed cab-drivers were little or
nothing better than the others. A class has always existed
of a very profligate character, chiefly those employed in
night work, although some respectable contractors employ
a portion of their cabs at night, simply because they have not
room in their stables for all their stock during the same hours.
The bad class are willing to "sign" for a higher amount
than others, and they resort to every discreditable purpose
to make it answer, especially seeking for fares from swell-
mobsmen, drunken, and profligate persons.    They also
ordinarily live with bad women, who by their sin assist
in their support.  The article in the "Chronicle," just
quoted from, stated their number as " 1-1th, or to speak
beyond the possibility of cavil, 1-12th of the whole number
of [licensed] cab-drivers." They are now not more, pro-
bably, than 1-20th, but they are only transferred to the
unlicensed portion of the trade.</p>

<p>  It must be at once apparent how fearfully these dissipated
night-drivers, and these unlicensed outcasts from prisons,
must tend to bring an ill-repute on cab-drivers in general.
And yet it would be unjust to them not to distinguish the
one class from the other. It should be known also that
about a third of the London cabs belong to small masters,
who often drive their own vehicles, and who are the most
respectable portion of the drivers. Another large class of
drivers, who are of a more respectable order, are those
employed at the railway stations. The railway authorities
select the best vehicles and horses, and drivers on whom
they can best depend for the faithful and cheerful perform-
ance of their duties. They also impose a fine of 5s. for
drunkenness, 5s. for insolence, 5s. for overcharge of fare or
luggage, and 10s. for retaining any article left by a pas-
senger in the cab. A second offence is punishable with
dismissal.</p></div2>

<p>  On the whole, the alteration made some two years since, of
placing the licenses of cabs in the hands of the Commis-
sioners of Police, has worked well. Greater strictness is
exercised in not allowing licenses to men of known bad
character.  The 700 licenses taken away last June, to
which previous reference was made, illustrate this very
forcibly. More stringent rules have been issued, especially
with regard to stands, while this work has been passing
through the press, the effects of which have yet to be
determined.</p>

There are about 200 authorized stands. They have been
recently increased, but they will even now hold but a small
proportion of the existing cabs. The stands near theatres
are generally the worst. Those near the river below London
Bridge are also bad. Such is also the case with those in
low neighbourhoods. The South part of London, near the
Surrey and Victoria Theatres in particular, is the resort of
the worse class of cab-drivers.  But <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName> stands

  <p>The character of the respective stands, and the degree of

from 1 to 4 watermen to each stand, according to its import-

waterman's office is considered the top post in the trade.
They are entrusted with the preservation of order on the

sidered, and remedied to the utmost of our power. The
driving of a cab . . . is often a last resort when other
employment fails; and, on many grounds, not a few who are
thus engaged would abandon such an employment for ever,
could they obtain a situation in which they would not be
exposed to such scenes of profanity and wickedness as they
are frequently obliged to witness. Among the cabmen . . .
there are many who are upright, &#x0026;c., . . but speaking of
them generally, they are . . . exceedingly profane among
themselves, &#x0026;c... Ladies, when unprotected by a gentleman,
are often annoyed, . . and their timidity is practised upon
and taken advantage of. . . But our object is, not to describe
the cabmen of London, but to call attention to them as a
very large, but neglected body of persons. Day and night
they are to be found on the various stands in the metropolis,
and exposed to every variety of weather, with but short
intervals for sleep and domestic comfort. Their home is
chiefly in the streets. The Sabbath is to them not a day of
rest, and not many persons care for their souls. A few
Christians have spoken to them kindly, and have given them
tracts; and missionaries of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName> have
not failed to interest themselves in this class of our popula-
tion, and especially so where they have cab-stands either on
their districts or contiguous to them. But no systematic
effort has yet been made to give them good counsel, or to
awaken their attention to the claims of their own souls and to
the claims of God. They are acquainted with the outside of
churches and chapels generally, for they get many fares on
the Sunday either to or from places of worship. But they
very seldom, if ever, are found observing the Sabbath and
worshipping God. What can be done for them ? It is pro-
posed, that two missionaries should be appointed, whose
services should be entirely devoted to cab and omnibus men.
This would be a beginning, though totally inadequate to the
necessities of the case."

                   his Great Success.</head>
  <p>One missionary only was provided for in answer to this
appeal. His name was Adams. He had himself been for
many years the proprietor of a cab, which he himself drove.
Having, however, a very numerous family, whom he found
it difficult to sustain on a missionary's salary, he was led to
emigrate to Australia, after some years' faithful labours
among the class with whom he had been previously associated.
He was much respected on the stands, and was made useful
in many instances.</p>
  <p>In the Annual Report of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName> for
<date value="1844">1844</date>, it was stated,--" Cab-stands have been visited during
the year by several of the missionaries, and about 4 months
since a missionary was appointed exclusively to attend upon
and visit the drivers of cabs and the drivers and conductors
of omnibuses. Since his appointment, he has visited various
cab-stands 178 times; he has had 2,156 conversations with
cabmen, watermen, drivers and conductors, and has paid
169 visits to the houses of those who have been sick and
dying, and has given away 3,010 tracts. The missionary is
received with the greatest kindness and respect. He has
found a large number of the drivers and conductors entirely
ignorant of the first principles of religion, and living in. a
most degraded state. He has heard that about 23 drivers
are communicants, and about 50 regularly attend public
worship; but thousands of them never cross the door of
God's sanctuary, nor acknowledge their Creator any more
than the beasts that perish. One man told the missionary,
he had not been in a place of worship for 32 years, and
although he had a Bible, he had not read a chapter in it for
5 years.  Several encouraging circumstances have tran-
spired."
</p>



<pb id="p.184" n="184"/>

  <p>In the Report of the same Society for the succeeding year,
<date value="1845">1845</date>, it is stated,-" In the last Report, the appointment of
a missionary to the cabmen of the metropolis was referred
to . . . He has, during the past year, been greatly blessed
of God in his labours, although he has generally had to
prosecute them while standing in the crowded streets, among
men intently looking for a fare. The habits of these men
are very much against them. Exposed to all weathers, some
of them by night, they frequent the public-house for a
stimulant," &#x0026;c., &#x0026;c.</p>
 <p> The following striking cases of usefulness are then
recorded, which had occurred during the year:-</p>
  <p>"One cabman was found by the missionary living with a
female, the mother of two children, and then again near her
confinement. He had been once in Newgate, and twice in
the House of Correction, and for the last 4 years he had
been deprived of his license to drive in the public streets.
But what a prison could not accomplish, the missionary, by
God's blessing, has effected. He is now married to the
woman with whom he lived; they have both become regular
attendants at the missionary's meeting; and he is frequently
to be seen sitting with the children, in the <orgName key="Ragged School">Ragged School</orgName>
which the cab missionary has opened during the year. The
missionary has recommended his case to the registrar, who
has, on the faith of this recommendation, again granted him
his license, and he is now in a creditable manner following
his lawful calling.</p>
 <p> "Another cabman has discontinued driving his cab on the
Lord's-day, and for the last 10 months has been a consistent
communicant, bringing forth the peaceable fruits of the
Spirit. His wife told the missionary, that at one time she
was obliged, when she heard the footsteps of her husband, to
hide her Bible, but now her home has become a happy one.
God has blessed her husband, not only in his soul, but also



         <pb id="p.185" n="185"/>

in his temporal circumstances, for when the missionary first
visited him, he was the owner of 1 cab and 2 horses, but
now he has 2 cabs and 4 horses. This case illustrates the
declaration that ' godliness is profitable unto all things,
having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is
to come.'</p>
 <p> "A woman, who had made a profession of religion, 10
years since, married a cabman, who had no fear of God
before his eyes. From that time she forsook the public
means of grace, and neglected private prayer; nor had she
for 7 years read any portion of God's Word. She is now
brought to repentance.  She desired to establish family
prayer, and to the surprise of the missionary, her husband
came to his residence for a tract of prayers. He consented
to conduct the service; and, ' Sir,' said she to the missionary,
'I will leave you to judge of my feelings, when I beheld my
husband, who had lived with me for 10 years, without any
regard to religion, shed tears while on his knees offering to
God the prayer of Tuesday evening.' She has been admitted
a communicant, and there is great reason to believe that he
is in earnest for the salvation of his soul.</p>
  <p>" To a young man the cab missionary's labours were made
useful; and for the last 9 months he has been a receiver of
the Lord's Supper. His mother has also been in a pleasing
state of mind. But the father was a bitter opponent of
religion, and threatened to stab the first missionary who
should enter his abode, and cut the throat of his wife if she
allowed a missionary to come in. He became at length so
violent that the son, having, since he became religious, been
so prospered as to save 251., determined on leaving his roof,
and the mother was driven to accompany her son, and cast
herself upon him for support. When the son stated to the
cab missionary what he had done, the cab missionary offered
to visit the father and endeavour to benefit him. The son





<pb id="p.186" n="186"/>
begged that he would not, as he believed that blood would
be shed if he ventured into his room on such an errand.
But the missionary went, and showed him the consequences
of his conduct; and, without entering into details, suffice it
to say, that the family are now living happily together, and
all regularly attend the house of God, and give much pro-
mise of real devotedness to the Lord."</p>
  <p>It is added,-" During the year he has read the Scriptures
to cabmen on 689 occasions, paid 484 visits to the sick and
dying, induced 17 regularly to attend public worship, and 5
altogether to give up Sunday work; 4 cabmen have been
outwardly reformed, 7 have been admitted to the Lord's
table as communicants, 4 backsliders give evidence of being
reclaimed, 7 individuals now in health of being converted to
God, and of 2 others in affliction, and 5 who have died, the
same good hope is entertained. These results are truly
large among such an order of men."</p>

   </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="A Second Missionary appointed, but soon discontinued, through want of Funds for his Support" id="c3s25"><head>A Second Missionary appointed, but soon discontinued,
         through want of Funds for his Support.</head>
 <p> In the succeeding year, <date value="1846">1846</date>, the contributions for the
cab missionary were increased to 931. 16s. 7d. Encouraged
thereby, a second missionary was appointed by that Society
in <date value="1847">1847</date>; but the contributions in <date value="1847">1847</date>, for the two mission-
aries, fell to 32l. 6s. 6d.  This second missionary had
therefore to be removed to an ordinary district, where he is
to this day labouring most efficiently. He also was himself
previously a cab-driver and proprietor, and, consequently,
well acquainted with the neglected class of men whom he
was appointed to instruct. What a blessing might he not
have been among them, if from that time to this he had
been retained as at first appointed! And is it not a
reproach to a Christian public, that when a missionary
was raised up to the Society for a peculiar work in which




              <pb id="p.187" n="187"/>

missionary effort was so urgently needed, he could not be
employed in it ? Even now, how easily might his services
be secured for this neglected class! He had the South of
the river appropriated to him as his district, and from the
day he relinquished it to the present time, the cab-stands in
the South of London have received no systematic visitation
from either the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName> or any other Society or
individuals.</p>

           </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Cases recorded of his Usefulness" id="c3s26"><head>  Cases recorded of his Usefulness.</head>
 <p> The <title>"London City Mission Magazine"</title> for May, <date value="1847">1847</date>,
contains a variety of cases of usefulness among cabmen
which had arisen during the year, from the effects of each of
the cab missionaries, their respective reports being there
published separately. But although they are very numerous
and very encouraging, and although the article ended with
the sentence, "We earnestly hope that our readers will
come forward more liberally in support of this fund,' so
as to allow the second missionary to be replaced," the Chris-
tian public made no response to the appeal! !</p>
 <p> The very first case there recorded illustrates how the cab
business is frequently taken to by persons who have become
reduced, and were once in very different circumstances, and
how serviceable religious counsel and instruction may be to
them, through the Divine blessing. There are a consider-
able number of cab-drivers who have once possessed pro-
perty, and who have received the advantage of a good
education. They find it very difficult to brook the treat-
ment which they frequently receive from those whose
feelings towards them are of the same contempt as the term
by which they ordinarily call them, of " cabbies." But to
return to the case. It is as follows :-</p>
  <p>" Mr. -   , of -  street, has been long known to me as
depraved in his morals and sensual in his habits. He has




<pb id="p.188" n="188"/>

often been spoken to by me; but until some months since,
religion was looked upon by him as a cunningly-devised
fable. A few facts relating to his early history may not be
considered uninteresting. His grandfather was a clergyman
at --, and held two livings to the time of his death. His
father was a person of some property, which he accumulated
as a solicitor. On the death of his father, he came into
possession of 3,000l., which, it seems, he soon spent, and as
a means of support became a cab-driver. About two years
since, while out with his cab, and in a state of intoxication,
he committed an assault upon a gentleman, for which he was
committed to the House of Correction, and his driving license
was revoked. For some months past he has been one of the
most attentive and regular hearers at my weekly meeting, is
now a sober man, and devotes much of his time to reading
the Scriptures."</p>
  <p>The next case recorded is a very striking illustration
of the importance of religious visitation to a class of cab-
men (and they are numerous) who have been previously
the subjects of religious impression:-</p>
 <p> " Some years since, -   -- , late of -    mews, was a
member of the Church under the pastoral care of the <persName key="Evans, Rev. J. H.">Rev. J. H. Evans</persName>, but at last, through his own unfaithfulness,
and his wife's violent temper, he gave up his connexion
with the people of God. It is now about two years and
a-half since he was first conversed with by me at the stand
in Farringdon-street, when he said (to use his own words),
'I am a miserable backslider.' I faithfully warned him of
the danger of continuing in his then present course, and
brought before him a few of the many invitations held out
in the Scriptures to such as had forsaken the fold, but to no
good effect, at least for some time. Having been requested,
by the <persName key="Evans, Rev. J. H.">Rev. J. H. Evans</persName>, not to lose sight of him, I sought
and often obtained the opportunity of speaking to him on




                           <pb id="p.189" n="189"/>

Divine things. At last my mind was much pained to find
that he had sold one of his cabs in the street, and had left
London in company with a female.    But he was soon
brought to feel the truth of the following passage of God's
Word, 'There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.'
He returned home to his wife, by the blessing of God he
was enabled to put away the evil of his doings, he became
regular in his attendance where he once had a name and a
place, and from that time, when out with his cab, he is often
to be seen reading his pocket Testament. He at last had an
interview-with his late pastor, but it was thought prudent that
he should wait for some months before he was again admitted
a member. For the last 2 months that he was on the
district I looked upon him with some anxiety, but there are
now no doubts with respect to his having been made a partaker
of Divine grace. Through my recommendation, he has been
for the last six months coachman to a gentleman of title,
during which time he has given great satisfaction by his
conduct."</p>
 <p> Another case recorded in that magazine is that of a
cabman, earning only 12s. a-week, who received an offer
from a friend of a permanent situation in a public-house of
30s. a-week, but who declined the same, by the missionary's
advice, lest he should fall into a snare thereby, while, by
means of the missionary's visitation, both he and his wife
were received by their minister as communicants. Then
follows the case of a cabman's wife, who, from a drunkard,
became a sober woman by the same agency. Next fol-
lows the case of a cabman who was an Infidel, but who was
led by the missionary to attend, apparently with profit, the
ministry of the Hon. and <persName key="Noel, Rev. B. W.">Rev. B. W. Noel</persName>. We next read
of a cabman, so impressed with the visits of the missionary,
that he himself calls at the missionary's residence to tell him





<pb id="p.190" n="190"/>

the impression which his conversation had made on his soul;
and, while the missionary speaks to him, he calls out, " Stay,
sir, it is more than I can bear. You have unmanned me."
After this comes the case of a cabman, known among his
comrades by the name of " Drunken Dick." While drunk
he had once had his skull fractured, and twice his limbs had
been broken. But, through God's blessing on the mission-
ary's efforts, he died, as is believed, a true penitent, trusting
in his Saviour's forgiveness, and received from a very faith-
ful clergyman, on his death-bed, the Supper of his Lord. A
second case, of a somewhat similar character, succeeds this.
Then are given cases of usefulness from the efforts of the
second missionary. First, we are told of a cabman who has
given up working his cab on a Sunday. Secondly, we are
told of a drunken cabman who had become a sober man,
after having well-nigh broken a brother's heart by his pre-
vious conduct; for which the missionary receives the thanks
of the brother, given " with feelings of emotion which spoke
more than words could convey." Thirdly, we are told of
the wife of a cabman who, on her husband's death, had to go
out to service, but who, impressed by the missionary's
instructions, declined taking any place, except in a religious
family, although she had long to wait for such a place, to
her great inconvenience. Fourthly, we read of a cabman's
wife who had once been a communicant, but had long
declined from a religious course, brought back again from
her wanderings to His people. Fifthly, we read of a cabman
visited, and the tears streaming down his weather-beaten
cheeks while the missionary expounded to him the Word of
God, and 2 of the children sent, by his persuasion, to school.
Nor are these all the cases of usefulness which are even
recorded in that one Report. But they suffice to show what
blessings result from such efforts among such a class.

</div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="The Emigration of the First Missionary, and the Appointment of his Successor, with Review of his Efforts and Success" id="c3s27"><head>The Emigration of the First Missionary, and the Appointment of his Successor, with Review of his Efforts and
  Success.</head>
 <p> After <persName key="Adams">Mr. Adams</persName> had emigrated, for some short period
no one discharged the duties which he had relinquished.
But late in the year <date value="1849">1849</date>, the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName> appointed
a successor, who is to this day engaged in the work. He
was not, like his predecessor, originally in the trade him-
self, and for some time he had a difficulty in learning the
ways of the particular class for the promotion of whose
benefit he was appointed to labour. But he made it his
business to acquaint himself intimately with their habits,
and he is now everywhere received as their friend. The
access which he has obtained to them admits of scarcely any
exceptions. It is fully equal to what is ordinarily expe-
rienced in district visitation. Although suspicious at first,
kindness goes very far with cabmen, they meet with so little
of it in general. His influence also increases materially each
year, as he becomes better known. The instances with
which he meets of good effected by his predecessor is also
very encouraging. His qualifications for, and his interest
in, the particular work assigned him by the Society with
which he is connected, are probably fully equal to those of
Mr. Adams, although those were considerable. In the year
<date value="1852">1852</date>, he reported that he had made 14,638 visits to cabmen,
of which 329 were to the sick and dying. He distributed
among them  15,062 religious tracts.  He also read the
Scriptures in his visitation that year (notwithstanding all
the unfavourable circumstances which are connected with
the doing so) 555 times. 14 cabmen had that year been
through his instrumentality brought to attend public wor-
ship, and 3, the fruits of his efforts, had become communi-
cants. He does not visit south of the river, nor further east





<pb id="p.192" n="192"/>

than Blackfriars. But there are, nevertheless, about 100
stands which he systematically and regularly visits.  He
also finds numerous profitable opportunities for religious
conversation with cabmen, while they are kept waiting,
sometimes a long time, for ladies and gentlemen at their
own doors. He also to some extent visits their wives and
families, although not very much, as they receive the visits
of his brother missionaries and of other religious visitors,
from which many of them have derived much benefit.
Probably no class of men receive religious tracts more
readily, or more generally read what are given them. This
partly arises from the time on their hands, while waiting
about. Some persons who ride in cabs are accustomed to
leave a tract on the cushion inside. It is a very easy mode
of doing good. Very few persons hiring cabs appear, how-
ever, to speak much religiously to the drivers.</p>
 <p> Most cabmen, on becoming religious, relinquish the trade,
and enter some other, which prevents so much fruit appear-
ing from the efforts made as would otherwise be the case.
There are, however, probably as many as 150 cabmen who,
from religious principle, do not take out their cabs on Sun-
days. Many others only do so occasionally, and especially
to oblige regular customers. And others refrain from Sun-
day work at the times of year when only little is to be
gained by going out on that day. The cab missionary of
the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName> considers that 100 of the London
cabmen might be found who give every evidence of being
truly religious men. This is probably more than many of
our readers would have supposed.  It has been brought
about by various means, but the efforts of the <orgName key="London City
Mission ">London City
Mission </orgName>have most materially aided in it.</p>
<p>  A letter was received from <persName key="Adams">Mr. Adams</persName> on
<date value="1853-03-18">March 18,1853</date>, dated Biminyong,  <date value="1852-11-26">November 26,1852</date>. It is the
first intelligence which the Society has received from him




               <pb id="p.193" n="193"/>

since his emigration. And the letter manifests that, although
so many thousand miles distant, having been prospered by
the Lord, he has not forgotten his former work.   The
following is an extract: "I intend shortly to send a draft
for 100l., in favour of the City Mission, as a small thank-
offering to the Lord, for not only the mercies I now possess,
but in remembrance of those blessed seasons I once enjoyed
in communion with the City Mission. I trust the day
is not far distant when I shall again be privileged to make
known the Saviour's love, in London, to poor sin-sick
sinners."
</p>
     <p> Case of Usefulness through a Scripture Reader.
  Although no other Society employs an agency exclusively
for the benefit of cab-drivers, still they are met with in
ordinary visitation here and there, and important results
have often accompanied efforts made on their behalf. The
following case is an illustration. It is taken from the <title>Twelfth
Occasional Paper of the Church of England Scripture
Readers Association:-</title></p>
  <p>"-- (cabman), whose case I before reported on, is now
so far restored to health as to enable him to follow his em-
ployment. When he was first able to do so, he had great
difficulty in procuring any; but that being accomplished,
another presented itself. In the days of weakness and pain
he had openly declared himself on the Lord's side, by par-
taking of the sacrament, and vowed from thenceforth he
would lead the life of a Christian, and let his light shine
before men; but how was this to be accomplished? If he
took a cab, the master did not understand letting his beast
rest in compliance with God's command; but I am happy to
say that, without any prospect of assistance, he has hitherto
rested on the Lord's-day, and has paid 5s. to be allowed to
do so. To those who ' seek first the kingdom of God and





<pb id="p.194" n="194"/>
his righteousness,' all needful things are promised.  The
woman told me to-day how rejoiced her husband was that
God had strengthened him to put into practice that which
he had resolved, trusting to Him so to command his blessing,
that the remaining 6 days might prove sufficient to maintain
his family."</p>

  </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Cases of Usefulness recorded by the Cab Missionary of the London City Mission, last Year" id="c3s28"><head>Cases of Usefulness recorded by the Cab Missionary of the
             <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName>, last Year.</head>
   <p>The following 4 cases of usefulness, recorded by the cab
missionary of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName> last year, illustrate
the vast importance of such an agency, especially devoted
to this class of men.</p>
  <p> " Case 1.-Mr. --, No. -, --       yard, for 2 years
placed himself under my instruction, and frequently have I
seen him affected to tears. One morning he came to me in
great distress of mind on account of his sins. I explained
to him with much fulness the Gospel of Christ, and
especially the doctrine of the atonement. Some time after
this he found peace through believing.  He attends the
ministry of the<persName key="Cumming, Rev. Dr."> Rev. Dr. Cumming</persName>, and lately he has become
a member of a <orgName key="Christian Young Men's Association">Christian Young Men's Association</orgName> in the
City, and bids fair to become an eminent disciple of the
Lord. He drives his father's cab, and uses a stand, which
for years had been admitted by the cabmen to be the worst
in London, for the stands differ as much as the various
localities of the poor. According to the old proverb,-</p>
                  <quote rend="blockquote"> 'Birds of a feather
                   Will flock together.'</quote>
<p>Many of the men of this stand lived in the numerous courts
close by with wicked women.   I believe formerly they
dreaded my coming on the stand.    At one time they
threatened to knock me down, and at another time to drive
over me, but finding I was not to be thwarted from my duty




                <pb id="p.195" n="195"/>

they then tried to shun me, and would leave me in possession
of their cabs. 'The wicked fleeth when no man pursueth.'
For the last 12 months Mr. -  has boldly confessed Christ
on the stand, and I believe he has done more good than 20
policemen. It is now admitted without fear of contradic-
tion that this is the most improved stand in London.</p>
  <p>" Case 2.-Mr. -    , No. -,   -   street, has become
converted to God through the Divine blessing on my labours,
and his wife, who formerly opposed him, has also since become
converted to God. I frequently see them going to John-
street Baptist Chapel in company. It has pleased the Lord
to place this man as waterman on another of the City stands.
The class of men that use this stand are different altogether
from those who use the former, but they are equally injurious
to society, having among them two intelligent Infidels, who
use all the means in their power to turn the Word of God
into a lie. I once visited one of them who was sick, but he
ridiculed all I said, and made use of awful expressions with
reference to the day of judgment. For a time I appeared
to go on the stand only to be made a laughing-stock of, and
for a time Mr. --   shared no better lot. But his mild
temper and Christian consistency have put to silence ungodly
men, and they have been constrained to acknowledge to me
that my visits are doing good.  We are now quite masters of
the stand.</p>
  <p>" Case 3.-Mr. --  , No. -, was a so-called Latter-day
Saint, but at the same time a great drunkard. He rejected
my tract, and prejudiced the minds of the other men against
me, being waterman at the largest stand in London. In the
neighbourhood of the Opera-house he possessed great influence
over the men; and made six proselytes. One of them was
as great a fanatic as himself, and has since run away from
his wife, and robbed his best friends of about sixty pounds.
Ten months ago I went to see a sick cabman, and while






<pb id="p.196" n="196"/>
there Mr. --   came in. To prevent disturbance, I com-
menced reading the 15th chapter of <title>St. Luke's Gospel</title>,
explained the nature of true repentance, prayed, and left the
house. Three days afterwards I had a note, which informed
me that Mr. -     wished to see me. I called accordingly,
and was happy soon to discover that the chapter I read had
sunk deep into his heart. He at once saw his error, aban-
doned his Mormonism, and succeeded in inducing his prose-
lytes to do so also. He also became a sober man, and an
example to the stand. This stand is used by many bad
characters from <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>, owing to its being so close to
theatres. I trust soon to see it raised, and respectable.</p>
  <p>" Case 4.-    -     No.-,    -buildings, had been a
notorious drunkard, and when drunk he was very insolent, and
quite a nuisance to the shops in Farringdon-street, so that helost
his license. I had frequently spoken to him on the subject,
but he regarded my words as an idle tale. Hearing he was
ill, I went to see him.  My first instructions had not
fallen to the ground. As the tears ran down his cheeks,
he said, ' Oh, Sir, I fear I shall drop into hell !' I regularly
visited him, and another man, who died in the next room;
and gave him a Bible and suitable instruction. He was
soon able to get out. I induced him to attend the Meeting
held by the missionary of the district, who afterwards
visited him.   He has got his license again, is now
driving, and is quite a reformed character, abstaining
altogether from intoxicating drink. I consider him under
the power of the Spirit of God."

<p>Great Importance of an Addition of Missionaries to Cabmen-
  Facility of its Accomplishment, and Concluding Appeal.
  What dispassionate reader can fail, in reading these short
extracts, to perceive the benefit which even one cab mis-
sionary, by the Divine blessing, has accomplished ? If, instead





                <pb id="p.197" n="197"/>

of one, four or six had been employed, how much more
decisive might have been, and in all probability would have
been, the benefit! And how small would have been the cost
of this, as contrasted with the result ! How easily might it
have been done ! About <date value="4001">4001</date>. a-year would have been suf-
ficient. And what a trifle is such a sum for such an object!
The per-centage of such a sum on the amount expended in
fares, is such a fraction that it would be scarcely worthy of
consideration.</p>
  <p>Lady collectors would probably find few objects in the
promotion of which they would be likely to be more suc-
cessful. For the claim for aid could not but be admitted by
all their friends who are in the habit of availing themselves
of the accommodation of these vehicles, and who must have
observed for themselves the great need which their drivers
have of religious counsel. Those who deprive the cabman
of his Sunday and his religious privileges to drive them to
church or chapel, must also surely see that the cabman's
religious condition deserves their sympathy and aid. And to
how many gentlemen, who almost daily ride in cabs for
purposes of business or pleasure, might an eloquent appeal
be made by fair readers, whose influence and whose power
of persuasion and supplication are so great.  The earnest
desire and prayer to God is offered that this chapter may be
made the means of stirring up a much greater concern
for this somewhat ill-used and decidedly neglected, but most
important and constantly increasing class of men, on whose
moral and religious condition, moreover, the public at large,
for their own safety. and comfort, are so much concerned.
The Christian public, in particular, surely only need to know
the greatness of the evil and the easy application of a
remedy, to apply that remedy without further delay, in sure
dependance on the Divine blessing.

 <div2 type="subchapter" n="The Introduction of Omnibuses into London, and their previous Establishment in Paris" id="c4s2"><head>   The Introduction of Omnibuses into London, and their
             previous Establishment in <placeName key="Paris.">Paris.</placeName></head>
<p>TWENTY-FOUR years since, and an omnibus was a thing
unknown in the streets of London. The absolutely prodi-
gious and almost incredible traffic which now exists in the
use of these vehicles has all sprung up and attained to its
present height within this short period of time, in addition
to the very extensive and multiplied traffic in metropolitan
hackney carriages.   Like the cabs, they are of French
invention, for we imported their use from the gay city of
<placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>, while, as with the cabs, we were 10 long years before
our strong English prejudices gave way to the use of a
convenience, which may almost now be considered, with the
Londoner, not as a luxury, but as a necessary of life.</p>

  the English Metropolis, the Difficulties he encountered, and
  his subsequent Ruin.</head>

 <p> It is somewhat interesting to trace from its first small
commencement what has now become so very important a




<pb id="p.200" n="200"/>
social feature in our metropolitan habits. The early history
of these vehicles, and of the gentleman who first introduced
them in this country, is thus given in a letter of the Special
Correspondent, inserted in the " Morning Chronicle" of
, <date value="1850-09-26">September 26, 1850</date>:-</p>
   <p>" It was not until July 4, <date value="1829">1829</date>, that  <persName key="Shillibeer George">Mr.George Shillibeer</persName>,
now the proprietor of the patent mourning-coaches, started
the first omnibus. . . . The first omnibus, or rather the first
pair of these vehicles, for Mr. <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName> started 2, ran from
the Bank to the Yorkshire Stingo. Mr. <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName> was a
naval officer, and in his youth stepped from a midshipman's
duties into the business of a coach-builder, learning that
business from the late Mr. Hatchet, of Long Acre. Mr.
<persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName> then established himself in business in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>, as
a builder of English carriages, a demand for which had
sprung up after the Peace, when the current of English
travel was directed strongly to <placeName key="France">France</placeName>. In this speculation
Mr. <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName> was eminently successful. He built carriages
for Prince Polignac, and others of the most influential men
under the dynasty of the elder branch of the Bourbons, and
had a bazaar for the sale of his vehicles. He was thus
occupied in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>, in <date value="1819">1819</date>, when Mr. Lafitte first started
the omnibuses which are now in common use, and so well
managed, in the French capital. Lafitte was the banker
(afterwards the minister) of Louis Philippe, and the most
active man in establishing the Messageries Royales. Five
or six years after the omnibus had been successfully
introduced into <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>,  <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName> was employed by <persName key="
Lafitte">Mr.
Lafitte</persName> to build 2 in a superior style. In executing this
order, <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName> thought that so comfortable and con-
venient a mode of conveyance might be advantageously
introduced into London. He accordingly disposed of his
Parisian establishment, and came to London, and started
his omnibuses, as I have narrated.   In order that the





                            <pb id="p.201" n="201"/>

introduction might have every chance of success, and have
the full prestige of respectability, <persName key="Shillibeer">Mr. Shillibeer</persName> brought
over with him from <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> 2 youths, both the sons of British
naval officers, and the young gents were for a few weeks his
' conductors.'  They were smartly dressed in 'blue cloth
and togs,' to use the words of my informant, after the
fashion of Mr. Lafitte's conductors, each dress costing 51.
Their addressing any foreigner in French, and the French
style of the affair, gave rise to the opinion that Mr. <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName>
was a Frenchman, and that the English were indebted to a
foreigner for the improvement of their vehicular transit;
whereas <persName key="Shillibeer">Mr. Shillibeer</persName> had served in the British navy, and
was born in Tottenham Court-road. His speculation was
particularly and at once successful. His 2 vehicles carried
each 22, and were filled every journey. The form was that
of the present omnibus, but larger and roomier, as the 22
were all accommodated inside, no one being on the outside
but the driver. Three horses, yoked abreast, were used to
draw these carriages. There were, for many days, until the
novelty wore off, crowds assembled to see the omnibuses
start; and many ladies and gentlemen took their places in
them to the Yorkshire Stingo, in order that they might have
the pleasure of riding back again. The fare was 1s. for the
whole, and 6d. for half the distance, and each omnibus made
12 journeys to and fro every day. Thus <persName key="Shillibeer">Mr. Shillibeer</persName>
established a diversity of fares, regulated by distance; a regu-
lation which was afterwards in a great measure abandoned by
omnibus proprietors, and then re-established on our present
3d. and 6d. payments, the 'long-uns' and the 'short-uns.'
<persName key="Shillibeer">Mr. Shillibeer</persName> receipts were 1001. a-week. At first, he
provided a few books, chiefly magazines, for the perusal of
his customers; but this peripatetic library was discontinued,
for the customers (I give the words of my informant)
'boned the books.' When the young-gent conductors retired






<pb id="p.202" n="202"/>

from their posts they were succeeded by persons hired by
<persName key="Shillibeer, Sire">Sire. Shillibeer</persName>, and liberally paid, who were attired in a sort
of velvet livery..... The short-stage proprietors were
loud in their railings against what they were pleased to
describe as a French innovation. In the course of from six
to nine months, Mr. <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName> had twelve omnibuses at
work. He feels convinced that had he started fifty omni-
buses instead of two in the first instance, a fortune might
have been realized. In <date value="1831">1831</date>-2, his omnibuses became gene-
ral in the great street thoroughfares; and as the short stages
were run off the road, the proprietors started omnibuses in
opposition to Mr. S. The first omnibuses, however, started
after Mr. <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName>'s were not in opposition.  They were
the Caledonians, and were the property of Mr. <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName>'s
brother-in-law.  The third started, which were two-horse
vehicles, were foolishly enough called, ' Les Dames Blanches;'
but as the name gave rise to much low wit, it was abandoned.
The original omnibuses were called <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName>s, from the
name of their originator, on the panels; and the name is
still prevalent on those conveyances in New York, which
affords us another proof that not in his own country is
a benefactor honoured, until; perhaps, his death makes
honour as little worth as an epitaph.    The opposition
omnibuses, however, continued to increase, as more and
more short stages were abandoned, and one oppositionist
called his omnibuses <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName>s, so that the real and the
sham were not known in the streets. The opposition became
fiercer. The 'busses,' as they came to be called in a year or
two, crossed each other, or raced, or drove their poles reck-
lessly into the back of one another; and accidents, and
squabbles, and loitering, grew so frequent, and the time of
the police magistrates was so much occupied with 'omnibus
business,' that, in <date value="1832">1832</date>, the matter was mentioned in Parlia-
ment as a nuisance requiring a remedy; and in <date value="1833">1833</date> a Bill






                            <pb id="p.203" n="203"/>

was brought in by the Government, and passed, for the
' regulations of omnibuses,' (as well as other conveyances,) 'in
and near the metropolis.' Two sessions after, Mr. Alderman
Wood brought in a Bill for ' the better regulation of omni-
buses,' which was also passed; and one of the provisions
of the Bill was, that the drivers and conductors of omnibuses
should be licensed. The office of Registrar of Licenses was
promised by a Noble Lord in office to Mr. <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName> (as
I am informed on good authority), but the appointment was
given to the present Commissioner of City Police, and the
office next to the principal was offered to Mr. <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName>,
which that gentleman declined to accept. The reason as-
signed for not appointing him to the Registrarship was,
that he was connected with omnibuses. At the beginning
of <date value="1834">1834</date>, Mr. <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName> abandoned his metropolis trade, and
commenced running omnibuses from London to <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName>
and Woolwich, employing 20 carriages and 120 horses; but
the increase of steamers, and the opening of the <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName>
Railway in <date value="1835">1835</date>, affected this trade so materially that
Mr. <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName> fell into arrears with his payments to the Stamp
Office, and seizure of his property, and re-seizures after
money was paid, entailed such heavy expenses, and such
hinderance to Mr. <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName>'s business, that his failure ensued.
I have been somewhat full in my details of Mr. <persName key="Shillibeer, Mr. George">Mr. Shillibeer</persName>'s
career, as his procedures are, in truth, the history of the
transit of the metropolis, as regards omnibuses."

                        compared.</head>
  <p>Although we have copied the French in the extensive use
of omnibuses in the metropolis, it is not very creditable to
us that in many particulars of comfort and convenience
with reference to these vehicles, we have yet to imitate them.
It is true, indeed, that in our horses and their trappings,





<pb id="p.204" n="204"/>

as also in the celerity of their movement, we are superior to
our models; but we are yet without the advantage of the
cachet de correspondance, which shall carry us from almost
any one point to any other point of the metropolis for
the six sous, a lower sum than will carry us in London from
one end to the other of almost any direct route of street.
We are also yet without the very great convenience of our
neighbours in their bureaux, or waiting-rooms, at special places
in the routes, and the scarcely less important convenience of
admission to the omnibus on its arrival, by the number
of the ticket received in the waiting-room, to denote the
priority of the entrance of the respective passengers there;
so that the rude man who comes last on a wet day does not,
as with us, by his obtrusiveness obtain a seat, while ladies
and retiring persons wait in vain for their turn of accommoda-
tion. We seem also most remarkably and obstinately to
adhere to the inconvenience peculiar to ourselves of omni-
buses so narrow that the knees of the passengers, near the
door, almost effectually prevent their comrades from entering
or departing, while the hand-rail at the top, to steady us in
the difficult passage, is still omitted, with a prejudice as if it
was really hurtful, although the scanty width of our vehicles,
and the English rudeness of our conductors, who will start
before we can possibly reach our seat, render so small and
inexpensive a convenience, so far more important in our
vehicles. Nor have we yet copied the exhibition of the
important sign-board of complet, when the omnibus is full;
but we are still left to run after the vehicle, in rain and
mud, while the conductor, with all the independence of a man
who can serve no more customers, scarcely deigns to intimate
to us that he has no room remaining, after we have striven
to keep pace with his rapid movement, and to render more
audible our wants than we foolishly supposed, from his
silence, we had failed to do in the first effort we made.





                           <pb id="p.205" n="205"/>

  Nor, again, with all our eager desire for hurrying onwards
in our journeys without delays, and with something more
than <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName> speed, have we (which is, perhaps, the most
remarkable of all,) yet copied the practice of our French
friends, so far preferable to our own, of the fare being paid as
soon as the passenger is conveniently seated; but with each
passenger that alights there is still with us the sometimes
very tedious process, especially on a cold day, to be gone
through, of fumbling for some stray shilling carefully con-
cealed in some inside pocket, for which, when found, the
silver and the copper change have also to be counted out,
while all the passengers within are left patiently to wait the
completion of the reckoning before they can advance on
their journey. Some day, and it is to be hoped at no
distant one, we shall probably be wise enough not to stop
short in our imitation at the present point. But as we were
foolish enough to wait ten years before we would consent to
imitate at all the omnibuses of the French metropolis, we
seem disposed to wait another thirty years before we
are willing to make the arrangement of our omnibuses
resemble theirs, when theirs are so manifestly superior.</p>

</head>
 <p> The amount of capital invested in the London omnibus
traffic is very great indeed. Each omnibus costs somewhat
more than 100l., and it requires to work it 10 horses, which,
at 20l. each, is 200l., besides harness and other items, which
may be reckoned at 301. This is the prime cost. The
annual expenditure subsequently incurred is scarcely short
of 900l. for each omnibus; and it is reckoned that an omni-
bus, to pay, ought to receive in fares, in round numbers,
1,000l. a-year. There are nearly 3,000 London omnibuses,
which gives an original cost of 1,020,0001., and an annual
outlay of 2,700,0001.</p>

sum of 3,000,000l. in omnibus fares. The population of the
metropolis is only about 2,500,000 persons; so that there is
an average expenditure of 24s. by each inhabitant in London
every year in omnibus riding, which would pay for 96 three-
penny rides. But as infants in arms ride free, and are all,
therefore, an addition to the number of riders, and as the
inmates of workhouses, prisons, hospitals, &#x0026;c., on the one
hand, and those, on the other hand, too high in rank to
patronize such plebeian conveyances, and many other classes,
are shut out from these conveniences, the parties actually
using our metropolitan omnibuses must each, on an average,
expend nearly double the amount specified, and have pro-
bably each an average of 200 economical rides during the year.
This vast branch of locomotion is, in fact, the greatest in the
country, next to railway traffic; and, as will hereafter be
shown, even greater than that, so far as the metropolis is
concerned. Thirty thousand horses are employed in con-
nexion with the London omnibuses. It costs very nearly
1,000,000l. each year to provide them with necessary hay
and straw, and more than three-fourths of that sum to buy
them corn. The mere shoeing of the horses may be reckoned
at 7,800l. a-year, and the wear and tear of each omnibus is
at the rate of 501. a-year.

               produce to the Government.</head>
 <p> The taxes paid by these carriages are also considerable.
Some of our readers will probably be surprised to learn that
each London omnibus pays about 108l. each year (some






<pb id="p.208" n="208"/>
a still larger sum) for duty to Government, or, in all,
324,000l. annually. This is charged in the form of a mileage
duty of l 1/2d. for every mile traversed. It was previously
2 1/2 d. The duty is, of course, in addition to turnpikes, and
the Favourite omnibuses are reported to pay not less than
2,0001. a-year for the toll at<placeName key=" Islington-gate"> Islington-gate</placeName>.

    England, as compared with the Number in London.</head>
  <p>To what an extent omnibuses are in use in the metropolis,
as compared with the rest of England, is shown by the
return of these duties, from which it appears that London
pays four-fifths of the entire mileage duty of England on
stage-carriages.</p>

</div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="The almost incredible Length of Distance traversed periodically by the London Omnibuses" id="c4s10"><head>The almost incredible Length of Distance traversed periodically by the London Omnibuses.</head>
 <p> Nor is the amount of distance annually travelled by omni-
buses in London less remarkable. The following statement
is made by the special correspondent of the <title>"Morning
Chronicle: </title>"-" The average journey, as regards length, of
each omnibus, is 6 miles, and that distance is, in some cases,
travelled 12 times a day by each omnibus; or, as it is called,
' 6 there and 6 back.' Some perform the journey only 10
times a day, and some, but a minority, a less number of
times. Now, taking the average as between 40 and 50 miles
a day travelled by each omnibus (and that, I am assured, is
within the mark, while 60 miles a day might exceed it), and
computing the omnibuses running daily as 3,000, we find a
'travel,' as it was worded to me, of upwards of 140,000
miles daily, [or nearly a million miles weekly!] or a yearly
travel of more than 50,000,000 of miles, an extent that
almost defies a parallel in any distances popularly familiar;





               <pb id="p.209" n="209"/>

and that this estimate in no way exceeds the truth is proved
by the sum annually paid to the Excise for 'mileage.'.
The extent of individual travel by some of the omnibus
drivers is enormous. One man told me, that he had driven
his ' bus' 72 miles (12 stages of 6 miles) every day for 6
years, with the exception of 12 miles less every second
Sunday, so that this man had driven, in 6 years, 179,568
miles." <note place="foot" n="1">Letter lxxi.</note> The man here referred to had driven his omnibus,
according to this reckoning, through London streets, a distance
more than 7 times round the entire globe in 6 years!</p>
 <p> Each omnibus was reckoned to have, on an average, 15 of
the 22 seats which were ordinarily provided occupied by
passengers, but since the practice has become more general
of providing additional accommodation for a double row of
gentlemen on the roof, the number has probably some-
what increased. But reckoning only 15 passengers each
journey, and 10 journeys a day, we have 150 passengers by
each omnibus, or 450,000 by the London omnibuses in
general riding daily, which is nearly a fifth of the entire
population.  The number of passengers by the London
omnibuses every week consequently exceeds 3,000,000, and
during the year amounts to 156,000,000 persons. And all
this has sprung up within 24 years.   It is perfectly
amazing.

And in the <title>"Times," </title>of the same day, at an inquest on

to have given evidence to the effect, that "the North-
Western Company ran 300 trains per day." Now 200,000
people daily coming in and out by all the metropolitan
railways, when multiplied by 365, gives an annual number
of 73,000,000 travellers by the metropolitan railways, which
is less than one-half of the 156,000,000 annual passengers
by the metropolitan omnibuses; while with 300 trains
a-day by the greatest of the metropolitan railways, 12,000
omnibus journeys through the main streets alone, or 450,000
passengers in general, will sustain a comparison.  The
recent introduction of penny omnibuses, and the still more
general admission among omnibus proprietors of the prin-
ciple of railway traffic for the masses (acted on, however,




               <pb id="p.211" n="211"/>

on rails chiefly by Parliamentary trains, run but once a-day,
and at the most inconvenient hours which can be selected),
by carrying passengers at the rate of 1d. a mile, are likely
far more extensively to develop the capabilities of omnibus
traffic.  The recent reduction of omnibus fares and the
removal of the metropolitan toll-gates are said to have much
benefited the omnibus trade. But fine seasons are more
profitable to omnibuses than rainy ones, as so few ladies
leave home in bad weather.

  <p>The importance and the vastness of the London omnibus
traffic have been thus fully referred to, that with increased
force the solemn question may be asked, " And what is the
position of omnibus men ?"-by whom are meant the driver,
the conductor, and the ostler, for each omnibus gives full
employment to these three parties, in addition to stable-
keepers, time-keepers, and a variety of other dependents,
Seven persons may be reckoned as required for every two
omnibuses, which will give a total of 10,500 persons, if the
number of London omnibuses is reckoned at 3,000. As,
however, the driver and the conductor are the parties with
whom the public are chiefly familiar, in connexion with
omnibuses, to them more particularly reference will here be
made. The number of licensed omnibus-drivers on Dec. 31,
<date value="1852">1852</date>, was 1,949, and of licensed omnibus-conductors, 2,227.
To these may probably be added 2,000 supernumeraries,
or "odd hands," as they are called, by which is meant
men who drive or conduct occasionally, and 3,000 horse-
keepers.</p>

 <p> Like the cabman, the omnibus-man has no Sabbath.
Regarding the Sabbath only as a day of rest to the body, he
is in this respect ordinarily worse off than the horses he
drives. If he be even regarded as possessing no soul to
whose immortal interests he needs to give heed, and if he
be degraded to a level with his cattle, and regarded as
only possessed like them of a body, he is even then sunk
below them,-for they enjoy a day of rest, but he does not.
They are property, and cost money. He is to be had at any
time, and a slavish amount of work is to be had out of
him beyond what it would be for the interest of omnibus
proprietors that their horses should render, and, indeed,
beyond what they would be able to render. Much of what
is written in the previous chapter concerning the drivers of
cabs on the Sunday is equally applicable to the men engaged
in omnibuses. Indeed, in some respects, the case of the
latter is the worse. For, first of all, the running of omni-
buses on the Sunday is more general than the running of cabs,
because it is more profitable, and the labour of the omnibus
servant on other days is far the more severe, rendering a loss
of the rest of the Sunday the greater hardship and oppression.
The feelings of the men with reference to the numerous
riders in their vehicles with <title>Bible</title> and <title>Hymn-book</title> in their
hands, who are set down at church and chapel-doors, is also
much the same, as any reader may discover by seating
himself on a Monday morning by the side of an omnibus-
driver on his box, and inquiring of him respecting his
customers on the previous day. Considering that gentle-
men do not come to town on Sunday, and that business





                 <pb id="p.213" n="213"/>

is suspended on that day at the exchange, the bank, the
counting-house, and the warehouse, it seems surprising that
there should scarcely be an omnibus less plying the streets
on Sunday than on other days, while on some lines of road
omnibuses are even more numerous. What must the foreigners
who visited us in <date value="1851">1851</date> have thought of our boasted Sunday
observance (notwithstanding the closing of the <placeName key="Crystal

point is, that I receive more money than I used to do, and I
trace it to this. It is not that the receipts, I believe, are
actually larger, but it is that the men, having a better moral
example set them, and having a day of repose, which they
devote to honest, sober, and religious purposes, and being by
that greatly improved in moral condition, do that which they
have never done before-faithfully bring to me every farthing

  <p>"No. 4.-The proprietors do not allow a servant to rest
unless he is exceedingly ill and cannot work; then he must
pay a substitute to work for him. There is no proprietor in
London who discontinues any portion of his business on the
Sabbath in order to give his servants rest for religious or
physical improvement: when any portion of their business is
discontinued, it is owing to the weather or the scarcity of
passengers. I think, since the first introduction of omni-
buses, there never was known 50 omnibuses quiet on any
Sabbath-day. The horse-keepers, some of them, commence
work at 6 in the morning, and do not leave off until past
midnight; having to labour the whole of tie time, Sundays
and all days, cleaning, feeding, and attending to 10 dirty
horses every day, also their harness: they never have any
time set aside for their meals, generally taking them when
they can, and then in the stables: in fact, some I have known
to sleep in the stable upon the hay for months together,
never caring for home, body, or soul, through the labour

that has been imposed upon them. To be brief, the pro-
prietors care nothing for their servants; but their horses are
generally taken great care of, not working more than about
3 hours out of 24; but the men work 15 or 16. The
masters say the horses come from the pocket,-the men cost
nothing." <note place="foot" n="1">Pp. 78-81.</note></p>

  <p>The amount of labour which the drivers and conductors
of omnibuses have to perform is most truly such in itself,
that it needs no Sabbath addition. It is thus powerfully
described by a female writer, who assumes the name of
Silverpen (<persName key="Meteyard, Eliza">Eliza Meteyard</persName>) in the "<title> Working Man's Friend
and Weekly Instructor </title>" of  <date value="1850-08-03">August 3,1850</date>.</p>
  <p>" Of the 6,000 drivers and conductors, numbers work on
an average rather more than sixteen hours a-day; namely, from
before eight o'clock in the morning till after twelve o'clock
at night. The labour connected with railway omnibuses is
still severer than this, being twenty hours each third day,
and fourteen on alternate ones. Nor does the seventh day
bring rest, as in most laborious occupations; work goes on
in precisely the same manner: and, as on some lines of road,
the traffic is greater on Sundays than on other days,
the work is so far heavier. During the number of hours
the men are employed they have no rest. The driver never
leaves his box, except during a few occasional minutes whilst
his horses are changed; and he has, therefore, to take
his meals during those periods, and sometimes upon the
coach-box, as, where the men have wives and families, some
member of them may be often seen handing up the tea
or dinner in a can or basket. As the married portion of







                   <pb id="p.219" n="219"/>

these men universally say, they 'never see their children
except as they look at them in bed;' and as for home, in its
commonly-received sense, or any of the moral duties con-
nected with it, the one is unknown, and the other is impos-
sible. The case of the conductors is precisely the same,
neither having a day's rest for months together, for if they
take one they have to pay a substitute; and in many cases
the proprietors object to a day's relaxation, and will not
hire men who need, or may ask for it, such indulgence
being against the laws of their particular Association. For
a loss of time they are fined 2s. 6d., and for a second
or third offence, suspended from a week's employment,
or else dismissed. Against stringent rules of this kind we
should take no objection, were the hours of labour in any
degree of reasonable length; in that case, stringency would
be doubly effective, both as regarded the interest of the
proprietary and public convenience."</p>
  <p>What is this but English bondage ?</p>
  <p>The same graphic writer, in the succeeding number of the
same periodical, thus draws a picture, if not taken from actual
fact, yet embodying the experience of not a few of the wives
of omnibus men.</p>
  <p>' ' Men there are, Sir, who have never seen their children
run, or laugh, or talk, or eat; all they perhaps recollect, if
these children die, is their sleep, and their last rest in the coffin !
Oh! Sir, hard things must come when men never rest-
neither Sabbath-day nor working-day; nor have no time
for their little ones, or their wives, or to make home-as it
really may be made, though a poor one-a cheerful place,
when a good and sober husband is there.'</p>
  <p>"'And what is worser, Sir,' weeps a half-clad woman,
with a baby at her breast, ' is the drinking that comes out of
this weariness. It ain't to be wondered at, and the sin on it
God must half forgive, seeing such a reason. But 0 the






<pb id="p.220" n="220"/>

homes it makes, of misery, and dirt, and want o' bread, and
the sort o' wives it makes! And then the children. Eh!
that is worser still. Ignorant, dirty, and often no other way
to go, but one o' wickedness. Oh! the drink, the drink!'
and the miserable woman bends down her face upon her
baby, and weeps tears that tell a story in themselves."</p>
  <p>The same omnibus servant, whose striking evidence was
just quoted on the Sunday work of omnibuses, thus des-
cribes the every-day work of omnibus men:-</p>
  <p>" Some omnibus servants work 14, some 16, and some
nearly 20 hours. Those who work nearly 20 hours are
railway omnibus drivers and conductors. They commence
at four in the morning, and continue, with the exception
of' about an hour and a-half, until twelve o'clock at night.
But the average is about 15 hours, out of which, on some
roads, they have only about seven minutes to dinner, and no
more time scarce all day. On some roads they have about
twenty minutesbetween each journey, but are only allowed
ten minutes out of the twenty for meals.   The other
ten minutes are spent in the conductor standing at the door
of his omnibus, and the coachman standing at his horses'
heads, or sitting on the box, in the wet and cold. . In fact,
the treatment the poor creatures receive is shocking, and I
think a disgrace to a Christian land. I have known men's
wives to be dying, their children to be dying, or relatives
dying, and time refused them to visit the afflicted, or to pay
the last tribute of respect to a departed friend or relative.
The man who earns most money is the most cared for,
regardless of his general behaviour or character."</p>
  <p>Every expression in this last extract, cannot be vindicated
as what a servant should employ towards his master, but
great allowance may nevertheless be made for it.</p>
  <p> So unremitting is the toil of these poor fellows that the
Meetings of a Society recently formed by themselves to






                <pb id="p.221" n="221"/>

improve their moral and social condition, have to be held

of omnibus-drivers and conductors, the greater part of whom
are honest, civil, and obliging-a sympathy which every

and reflecting upon the unremitting nature of their toil, and
their exposure to weather of every kind.</p>
  <p>"But when, from my experience as a medical man, I
know that nearly all of them, though young, are shattered

to debility, acute rheumatism, and bronchial affections of
so severe a nature, that they are most difficult to remove,
from the men's remaining under the operation of the same
causes which originally produced their complaints, and
which in many cases terminate in consumption,-my sym-
pathy is increased. Much more is this the case when I
reflect that these diseases arise entirely from the nature of
their occupation, their long hours (from  7 or 8 in the
morning often till past midnight), not excluding the Sunday;
from the few brief moments they have, in which to take
their necessary food, affording no relaxation to body or
mind; and lastly, from their exposure to the variations of
heat, cold, and moisture in the atmosphere.  When I
consider the importance of the service rendered by these
over-worked servants to the public, and the conveyance of

  Labour, by a Driver, a Conductor, and a Time-keeper.</head>
 <p> <persName key=" Mayhew, Mr.">Mr. Mayhew</persName> reports interviews which he had with an
omnibus-driver, conductor, and time-keeper, in which the
driver said-" I'm an unmarried man. A 'bus driver never
has time to look out for a wife. Every horse in our stables
has one day's rest in four, but it's no rest for the driver."
The conductor's statement was-" I never get to a public
place, whether it is a chapel or a play-house, unless, indeed,
I get a holiday, and that is not once in two years.  I've
asked for a day's holiday, and been refused.  I was told I
might take a week's holiday, if I liked, or as long as I lived.
. . . In winter I never see my three children, only as
they're in bed."  The observation of the time-keeper was-
"Mine is not hard work, but it's very tiring. You hardly
ever have a moment to call your own. If we only had our
Sundays, like other working-men, it would be a grand relief.
It would be very easy to get an odd man to work every other
Sunday, but masters care nothing about Sundays . .
I can't be said to have any home-just a bed to sleep in-as
I'm never 10 minutes awake in the house where I lodge."</p>
  <p>The severe toil of the drivers in general (and that of the
conductors is probably even still greater) is thus stated by
the same writer :-" Their work is very hard, their lives
being almost literally spent on their box.  The most of





           <pb id="p.223" n="223"/>

them must enter 'the yard' at a quarter to 8 in the
morning, and must see that the horses and the carriages
are in a proper condition for work, and at half-past 8 they
start on their long day's labour. They perform (I speak of
the most frequented lines) 12 journeys during the day, and
are so engaged until a quarter past 11 at night. Some are
on the box till past midnight. During these hours of labour
they have 12 'stops,' half of 10, and half of 15 minutes'
duration. They generally breakfast at home, or at a coffee-
shop, if unmarried men, before they start, and dine at the
inn where the omnibus almost invariably 'stops,' at one or
other of its destinations. If the driver be distant from his.
home at his dinner hour, or be unmarried, he arranges to
dine at the public-house. If near, his wife or one of his
children brings him his dinner in a covered basin, some of
them being provided with hot-water plates to keep the
contents properly warm; and this is usually eaten at the
public-house, with a pint of beer for the accompanying
beverage. The relish with which a man who has been
employed several hours in the open air enjoys his dinner can
easily be understood, but if his dinner is brought to him on
one of his shorter stops, he often hears the cry before he has
concluded the meal, ' Time's up !' and he carries the remains
of his repast to be consumed at his next resting-place. His
tea, if brought to him by his family, he often drinks within
the omnibus, if there be an opportunity. Some carry their
dinners with them, and eat them cold. . . . From a driver
I had the following statement:-' I have been a driver 14
years...  .  It's hard work, is mine, for I never have any
rest but a few minutes, except every other Sunday, and then
only 2 hours,-that's the time of a journey there and back.
If I was to ask leave to go to church, and then go to work
again, I know what answer there would be-" You can go

doesn't want to go there." "<note place="foot" n="1">Letter lxxi.

  <p>The temptation to drink to which omnibus-men are
exposed, is another serious peril in their path, and which,
with proper care on the part of proprietors, might most
easily be avoided, to the advantage of themselves as well as
their men.  How much force is there in the following
extract from " Silverpen:"-</p>
  <p>" Why is it that almost all omnibuses start from public-
houses ? From any convenience which may arise from this
custom, the proprietors pay nothing to the landlords, though
it is not likely that landlords would allow their several pave-
ments to be blocked up without some source or other of
remuneration. This, therefore, consists in the custom of
omnibus servants, who are only too apt, from exhaustion of
body, consequent on long hours and the laborious nature of
their work, to spend all, or nearly all, their earnings in
stimulating drinks. A proprietary that would employ, and
would estimate the services of a respectable body of men,
would not place such a form of continuous temptation in
their way; whilst, as to the public themselves, particularly
females, this plan has long been strongly objected to. Why
should not a rich proprietary have for their omnibuses






                    <pb id="p.225" n="225"/>

termini-houses of their own?  Therein a large part might
be made to pay their own expenses by affording, at a cheap
rate, tea and coffee, and even dining accommodation, to the
proprietary servants, whilst rooms enough would remain for
passengers to shelter and wait in, for the purposes of offices,
and as a look-out for the time-keepers, whose weather-bear-
ing capabilities seem now to be on a par with a church vane
or barn weathercock. Harshness gives no facility to labour,
and that the world may depend upon. What an improve-
ment such houses would be over existing circumstances!
Instead of the gin-shop bar, and the public-house tap-room,
the men would have a place for decent rest, for purposes of
cleanliness and for chaning clothes in wet and bad weather,
instead of being, as now, compelled to sit or stand the day
through in the same soddened clothes. We scarcely need a
registrar-general, or a physiologist, to point out the physical
benefits which would arise out of such improvements. But
whilst the gin-shop and the tavern are made any part of the
connecting link between the public and their accommodation,
many of the evils complained of, both by servants and
masters, must still exist." <note place="foot" n="1"><title>"Working Man's Friend,</title>"  <date value="1850-08-03">August 3,1850</date>.</note></p>

          </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Their Temptations to Embezzlement" id="c4s24"><head> Their Temptations to Embezzlement.</head>
  <p>Embezzlement is also a great temptation to omnibus men.
No effectual check can, in this country, as in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>, be
devised on their receipts. Various plans have been tried,
but the result has been found to be, that the manifestation of
suspicion only increased the evil, and that the men became
honest somewhat in proportion as they were trusted and
confided in. At the present time, a conductor may be dis-
charged at a day's notice, and the true reason not assigned;
and proprietors are supposed occasionally to commission a
friend to ride an entire journey and to count the passengers,







<pb id="p.226" n="226"/>

in order that the report may be compared with the way-bill,
which the conductor fills in. Still there is much temptation
to fraud. This is supposed by no means to be practised to
the same extent as at first, but no doubt there are still many
petty delinquencies on the part of some of the men employed.
While the men are so over-taxed in work, it is not to be
expected that they will be of the first order of servants.
Mistrust, and liability any day to be discharged without a
reason being assigned, add also materially to the difficulty.
" Not many years ago, the horses in omnibuses and carts
were a disgrace to civilized humanity, and, as Mr. Youatt
justly says, 'there was an atrocious system of over-work;'
but proprietors, at length finding that the speed the public
more and more required in vehicular accommodation would
never be attained by over-worked, ill-fed, worn-out hacks,
changed their plan of horsing the metropolitan stages, with a
result that is visible in every street, to every eye.... Give
but omnibus servants that proportionate rest which civiliza-
tion demands for its laborious classes, and proprietors will
soon find a respectable class of men demanding service. A
relay system would give partial rest on alternate Sabbaths
to every man, and enable him three days a week out of
every seven, to cherish the domestic affections, and to
advance in some degree with the other classes in mental and
moral culture. As it is, these men say, 'they have never
an instant to read book or paper; most of the circumstances
of the day which influence so beneficially the other processes
of labour, pass by almost unknown to them; and what little
they hear, even when a passenger condescends occasionally
to converse with them, usually concerns a fancy spaniel or
a horse-race.' Information addressed to them rarely takes a
higher flight than this ....</p>
  <p> "Throughout every inquiry made into the state of the
labouring classes, from the testimony of every manufacturer,






             <pb id="p.227" n="227"/>

capitalist, and master, both French and English, who has,
through his own practical operations, proved the truth, as
well as worth, of enlightened views of labour, we have testi-
mony, that it is not by mistrusting a low, ill-paid, unedu-
cated class of servants, but by trusting, and well paying
(even in some cases to the extent of an interest in the con-
cern), a body of educated and responsible servants, that
capital is best gathered and increased.</p>
  <p>" To show that there exist moral qualities, which might
be made equivalent to those needs of honest service, were
but these reciprocal duties of masters and men better under-
stood, the spirit of fellowship amongst the men themselves
bears evidence. According to the Act 6 and 7 Vic., drivers
are held responsible for all accidents and damages done to
property; and whatever the amount of such damages may
be, the proprietor can recover it from his servant, or, as is
usually the case, by stopping the amount out of wages.
Mostly, in occurrences of this sort, the men assist each other
by their contributions, as they also do in cases of sickness or
distress amongst themselves. The proprietaries have, in
too many instances, sought, rather than rejected, a low class
of servants." <note place="foot" n="1"><title>"Working Man's Friend,"</title>  <date value="1850-08-03">August 3,1850</date>.</note></p>

 <p> "Let us only seriously imagine these 10,000 men, with a
corresponding proportion of women and children, all con-
centrated in one spot, instead of, as now, scattered through
various districts of the metropolis; let us try to think of
them as inhabiting a separate portion of London, and exhibit-
ing palpably to the eyes of the neighbouring people all the
peculiar characteristics of what they practically are, HEA-
THENS IN THE MIDST OF A CHRISTIAN CITY. If Christians
saw them thus locally isolated, and their condition more







<pb id="p.228" n="228"/>

strongly brought to the light by viewing them in the mass,
we are sure that the sympathies of Christians would be as
much drawn out towards these unfortunate classes as they
now are to the dark tribes of<placeName key="Africa"> Africa</placeName>, or the more polished
Heathens of<placeName key="China"> China</placeName>.</p>
  <p>" Yet wherein lies the difference ? Only in this: that in
Christian England the wants of civilized people, and too
often the requirements and example of real Christians, force
these 10,000 men to be habitual Sabbath-breakers, and,
consequently, as much estranged from God and the realities
of eternity, as if they were dwellers in a land that knew not
God."</p>
<p>  " Ten thousand men in London alone! Would that these
and their too-much neglected families, a total, probably, of
some [30,000 or] 40,000 souls, could be collected together
as one distinct perishing population, their spiritual condition
made apparent, and the absence of all remedy hitherto exist-
ing brought vividly home to the consciences of Christians !"</p>
  <p>"It is indeed no narrow question, but an evil of gigantic
dimensions and of peculiar moment. When recently, the
religious spirit of the country was roused in respect of the
transmission and delivery of letters on the Lord's-day, it was
stated that, setting aside 2,000 persons in London unemployed
on Sunday, there were 10,000 in the provinces, holding situa-
tions directly from the Postmaster-General, all engaged for
the Post-office, in the every-day business of life, some part
of Sunday.   The hardship so inflicted was thought, and
justly so, to be grievous. But the writer pleads, not for
10,000 scattered throughout England, but for 10,000 in the
metropolis alone; and those not partially employed only, but
interminably and slavishly,-on the Sunday exactly as on
other days. This phase of London life is truly surprising in
its character, and cannot but induce thoughtfulness in every
Christian mind."</p>

achieve a certain reformation and improvement in individuals.
The system would remain. Can nothing be attempted to
reach and loosen the fetters of this ? The evil is, that though
'the omnibus men of London' are really and truly servants
of the public, they are under the control of a few proprietors.
These proprietors, however, derive their remuneration from
the public; and is it quite impossible for the religious feeling
of a large proportion of the customers to be brought syste-

  <p>Some of the omnibus men are themselves now seeking to







<pb id="p.230" n="230"/>

have their condition elevated. The following is an extract
from a speech delivered at one of the Meetings which have
been recently held by them for that purpose. It is from the
<persName key="Mackenzie, Rev. W. B.">Rev. W. B. Mackenzie:</persName>-</p>
  <p>" He said they were met to consider the present condition
of a large and industrious class of men, and to devise some
means for the improvement of their condition, which was a
great deal harder than the public were aware of. It only
required that the attention of a benevolent public should be
drawn to their condition, in order that it might not only be
alleviated, but entirely reformed.  Whenever great evils
were found to exist in this land, such was the national
spirit, that from the moment of its discovery its hours were
numbered. Improvements were sometimes slow, but when
the public was once aware of the nature of the evil, the
improvement was always sure. So it had been with the
mining population, until recently; they had suffered under
all the evils arising from children and females working in
the mines, but the public became acquainted with it, remedies
were applied, and their condition had undergone, and was
now undergoing, the greatest amelioration. The omnibus
servants might rest assured that the public would not show
less gratitude to men from whose services they derived such
manifold convenience. Ie was not very old, but he could
well recollect the different state of things with regard to
conveyance under the hackney-coach regime, and the public
too well appreciated the conveniences and advantages of the
present system of transit, not to be quite willing to support
the drivers and conductors in any scheme which would tend
to their improvement either in a social or religious point of
view  .... He inquired the other day of a driver about
their meal times, and found that the time allowed them for
their dinners was only seven and a half minutes! and the
breakfast which they had before starting, was almost the
only meal they had during the day, which deserved the name.






                               <pb id="p.231" n="231"/>

It was true that a driver might occasionally have a day's
rest, but it was only by paying a substitute, and even that
was unwillingly accepted, because the horses got accustomed
to their regular driver, and did not go well with strangers.
The situations of the conductors were even more precarious;
many of them were only daily servants, and how was it
possible for them to take any interest in the prosperity of
their employers, when they were not sure of remaining with
them a single day ? The sure way to render a servant not
trustworthy, was not to trust him. Another of the crying
evils of the present mode was the drinking habits which it
almost forced upon the men. Could it be possible for men
to avoid drinking, when they stopped at public-houses, wet,
cold, and weary from the continued fatigues of a long day ?
... He entered into a long detail of the various circum-
stances which led to the untimely deaths of large numbers
of the omnibus servants, and for the accuracy of which his
having attended their dying moments enabled him to vouch,
and concluded with an earnest appeal to the public sympathy
on behalf of such a hardly-used and hardly-worked class of
men.   The proprietors took care to let the horses rest 1
day out of every 4; and why should not a man, having a
family to provide with comforts, an eternity to attend to, a
death to prepare for, and a Saviour to meet, have the same
indulgence allotted to him as to the brute creation ?"

passengers for cross routes may change their conveyance
without paying a second fare. There are also to be waiting-

be on a scale of unprecedented moderation. The scheme
promises an amount of locomotive accommodation far beyond
anything before attempted. But a still more interesting
feature in the arrangements of the Company is its bearing
upon the moral, social, and religious well-being of what may
truly be called the Omnibus Community. The hours of
daily labour are to be reduced to 12; proper time is to -be
allowed for meals; every man is to have alternate Sundays
entirely free from labour, and on other Sundays, liberty is to
be given for attending divine service. The movement is in
the right direction; and its benevolent objects must com-
mand sympathy. It is satisfactory to observe that the new
company propose, if possible, to carry out their plans rather
by an amalgamation of existing interests than in the spirit of

<placeName key="Denmark-street">Denmark-street</placeName>, <placeName key="Soho">Soho</placeName>, on Wednesday,  <date value="1852-10-13">October 13,1852</date>:
-The Secretary, <persName key="Scully, Mr.">Mr. Scully</persName>, in explaining the origin and
objects of this Company, stated that it was the intention of
the Company to abolish Sunday traffic as far as they were
concerned, and thus give the whole of their servants that
day for relaxation, instruction, and religious services. It
had been found that Sunday traffic was an exceptional
traffic, and taking it altogether, perhaps, not profitable; but
whether that was the case or not, the Company were so
fully convinced of the manifold advantages of abolishing
Sunday labour, that they, at least, would act upon the
determination he had stated.  The Company also made
provision in its deed for setting aside part of its profits towards
endowing and properly providing for their superannuated
servants, and also a burial fund in case of death. He believed






                              <pb id="p.233" n="233"/>

that these arrangements, in conjunction with superior
accommodation for the public, would be sure to secure the
co-operation of those who felt an interest in measures
calculated to improve the condition of the labouring classes.
So confident did the Directors feel upon the subject that
they had that day ordered a number of omnibuses to be
constructed on the principle of the model omnibus which had
been exhibited for the last 2 days. The first order would be
sufficient to cover 1 line of traffic in the metropolis to begin
with. The Directors would gradually occupy other lines in
connexion with it, and afterwards graft upon the system, the
parcel traffic also." <note place="foot" n="1"><orgName key="Prospectus of Grand Junction Omnibus Company.">Prospectus of Grand Junction Omnibus Company.</orgName>

 <p> Should this scheme succeed, it will, of course,'be most
important. But it should ever be borne in mind that, after
all, the <title>Gospel</title> of the Lord <persName key="Christ, Jesus">Jesus Christ</persName> is the sovereign and
only remedy for human disorders. Civilization is calculated
to prepare the way for religion, but it is far more frequently
that religion is the means by which civilization is advanced.
A force of special missionaries would doubtless lead to the
remedy of many social evils, as well as be made the means of
diffusing the knowledge of salvation. It has at present not
even received a trial, either by the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName> or
by any other Society. All which has been done has been
the visitation of the men in the omnibus yards, or in cases
of sickness at their abodes, when these have happened to be
in the districts of City missionaries and Scripture-readers, or
when a Christian minister has rarely endeavoured to give
passing instruction. As an illustration of this character of
Christian effort, the following are given as</p>

<p>Extracts from 3 Reports of Missionaries of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName> during the present Year, on their Visits to Omnibus
  Yards:-</p>
  <p>Report 1.-" I am accustomed to visit the 8 omnibus-






<pb id="p.234" n="234"/>

yards of the district, in which there are 33 omnibuses,
requiring 330 horses to work them, and employing 115 men,
that is, 33 drivers, 33 conductors, 11 washers, 5 chaff-
cutters, and 33 horse-keepers, making together 115. They
all have to work the 7 days. Many of them have told me
they don't know the day when they saw the inside of a place
of worship. I think some of them would attend the means
of grace if they had the opportunity, and all of them would
be glad to have the Sabbath to themselves. The masters
that I have spoken to on the subject all think the men ought
to have a day's rest in the seven, and would be glad to adopt
any plan if it could be shown them how it is to be carried
out; but they say that the public compel them to work on the
Sabbath, and that they are obliged to work in order to keep
down their expenses. These, however, are excuses which
will not bear scrutiny. I visit these men at their work
every alternate Sunday afternoon, when I always find
them willing to receive the tracts, and most of them will
listen to the remarks that I have to make, but as a body of
men they are the most immoral and ignorant that I have
met with. They are especially addicted to drink, with all its
attendant evils  ..</p>
   <p>"I trust that I have been made useful to a man named
--, living at No. -,      street, who for the first time
opened his mind to me while visiting at the stables more
than a year since, when he said, 'I am convinced that I have
done wrong all my life in not attending to those things that
you have been speaking about, but what am I to do ? If I
was to follow your advice and go to a place of worship I
should have a nice life of it.' Soon after this he was taken
ill, and confined to his home, where I continued to visit him.
He remained in an unhappy state of mind for some time,
believing that he was too great a sinner to be saved-so
much so that his wife said he was going mad, but now I
trust he has been led to see the all-sufficiency of the Saviour.






                         <pb id="p.235" n="235"/>

He attends a place of worship as often as he can, and his
wife says that he is no sooner in-doors than he gets his Bible
and begins to read, not only to himself, but to her also.
I am glad to be able to say that she is also inquiring
after good things. She said on one occasion that she had
always looked upon religion as a very gloomy thing, but
since her husband had taken to it, she had begun to think all
was not right with herself. She now attends with him a
place of worship. His attendance, however, is necessarily
only occasional. But he reads his Bible, and continues to
manifest concern for his soul."</p>

 <p> " At first, and for some time, I visited these men on the
Lord's-day exclusively. For some time past recently, how-
ever, I have called on them occasionally on the Sabbath, but
chiefly on a week-day, because on week-days I meet with
the coach-builders and blacksmiths as well as with the
omnibus-men and horse-keepers. I not only present each
man with a tract, but as far as practicable draw their
attention, separately, to the relation in which they stand to
God, their spiritual necessities, danger, and destiny, the
provisions of the Gospel, the fact that redeeming mercy is
all-sufficient to transform, elevate, and eternally save even
them, &#x0026;c., &#x0026;c., and when surrounded by some 4 or 6 men






<pb id="p.236" n="236"/>

(which is not unfrequently the case) portions of God's word
are read and explained by me, and their attention to what
has been said affectionately entreated. Sometimes they will
endeavour to blunt the edge of an appeal to the conscience
by alleging their inability to attend to religion, arising
from the fact that their employers compel them to 'work as
hard on the Sabbath as on any other day, and even harder,'
and by expressing it as their opinion that their masters
ought to answer for their sins. Their repose is disturbed,
however, by my custom of inquiring whether their masters
will answer for their swearing, drunkenness, and other
irregularities, and by showing that their general ungodliness
proves that they are themselves daring transgressors against
God, and therefore are obnoxious to the threatenings of his
Word. Although I thus endeavour to deal faithfully with
their souls, even the more hardened and obdurate among them
have long since discontinued every indication of hostility and
ill-will; and it were easy to show that many of them receive
me, and listen to me, with feelings of apparent affection and
gratitude. The smiths when about to strike the red iron
will beg me to ' mind the sparks,' and will subsequently lay
down their hammers for a few moments and listen to God's
word; the horse-keeper when 'singeing' his horse will,
unsolicited, bring his gas-burner to my side to light me
while I read a portion of <title>Scripture</title>; and when in the larger
yards I have approached a number of them standing together,
I have overheard the welcome, ' Here comes our old friend.'</p>
   <p>"If it is remembered how degraded and destitute the
generality of these men are, and that the amount of toil
exacted from them (beginning at half-past 6 in the morning,
and not ending till near 11 p.m., and frequently not till after
midnight) constitutes them little better than slaves, there
seems but little encouragement to look for bright results.
But when it is also remembered that under the operations of






                        <pb id="p.237" n="237"/>

the Omnipotent Spirit of God 'lions and beasts of savage
name, put on the nature of the lamb,' hope cheers the
desponding heart, and success sooner or later is still prayed
for, and looked for by me.</p>
  <p>" In the month of May last, a man named - , formerly
living at No. -,     mews, died of consumption, after a
lingering illness. I visited him regularly while he remained
in the district, and several times, at his own request, after
he was removed from it. He searched the Scriptures daily
himself, and listened earnestly to instruction and prayer.
When I last saw him (about 12 hours before his death), he
expressed a hope, and I really believe it was a well-founded
one, that he was going to be with Christ.</p>
  <p>"At the present time, the case of a man, named -  ,
appears increasingly hopeful. This man works in
mews, and is the father of a somewhat large family. He
manages to follow his wife on a Sunday evening (himself
perhaps half an hour too late) to a Wesleyan chapel, and
assures me that he attends to private prayer. His wife has
voluntarily assured me that her husband is very often talking
about the missionary.</p>
  <p>"A  young man, who formerly laboured in -      mews,
called after me some 3 weeks ago, and with apparent pleasure
and gratitude informed me that he had left the mews, had
obtained a respectable place, and was now attending church
on the Sunday.</p>
 <p> " The number employed in      mews is not so large as
it formerly was, a large number of horses and omnibuses
having been sold by the firm with which it is connected."</p>
  <p>Report 3.--" There is no class of men for whose spiritual
and temporal state I feel a stronger sympathy than those
connected with our metropolitan omnibuses.</p>
  <p>" There are 7 yards and stables in the district, worked by
about 36 men. I have also a number' of drivers, conductors,





<pb id="p.238" n="238"/>

and horsekeepers living in the district, who are connected
with other yards. Their state, spiritually, morally, and
physically, is very bad. Among the whole number, I am
only acquainted with one man who is to any extent influ-
enced by Divine truth. There is not one who frequents the
house of prayer, and, as a natural consequence, they remain
dead in trespasses and sins.  Drunkenness and swearing
prevail to a fearful extent among them, their children are
neglected, and their homes are often dirty and unhealthy.
Their physical state is worse than that of any other class of
men I am acquainted with. I am now more particularly
referring to horsekeepers.  They frequently complain of
their work 'breaking them up.' They suffer mostly from
rheumatism and chest diseases. There are several causes
which produce this state of things. The horsekeepers work
from 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning till after 12 at night, and
drivers and conductors from 8 or 9 till 11 or 12 o'clock.
They are constantly exposed to the weather, and many are
badly paid. They have but short intervals for food, and
consequently no time for spiritual or mental improvement,
to attend to family duties, or to enjoy the pleasures of home.
But these things, bad as they are, would not have such a
crushing influence upon the men, if they were not robbed of
'Heaven's antidote for the curse of labour,' the blessed
Sabbath. Theirs is incessant toil from year's end to year's
end, except when interrupted by illness.  Each omnibus
always runs an extra journey on the Sabbath, if the weather
is fine. A horsekeeper once said to me, 'We poor fellows
only know it's Sunday by having more work to do, and by
seeing other labourers at rest.' One man I visited when ill,
told me that he had not been into a place of worship for 12
years, and another for 8. The' only difference I notice in
the yards on the Sabbath is, that the stable-men get forward
with their work in the morning, so that in the afternoon,





                        <pb id="p.239" n="239"/>

they may snatch half an hour, between changing their
horses, for home, or spend it in drinking together in the
hay-loft.</p>
 <p> "When I commenced visiting the district, I found them a
difficult class to work upon. I was received in several yards
with cursing and bitterness, and I was turned out of others.
I soon found with these, as with other classes of men, that a
knowledge of their condition and habits of life was absolutely
necessary for efficient visitation among them.  I felt it
prudent to devote part of the Sabbath to them, as they
received me better on that day. I made a rule not to go
into the yards till the roughest of the work was over, and,
when there, I avoided conversation with any man I saw
hurrying to get the horses ready for his omnibus. By these
means I gradually overcame their opposition, and gained
their confidence. I am now blessed in being able to make
known to them the tidings of great joy, designed for all
people. I now go into the yards, give tracts, and, where
opportunities offer, get into conversation with the men. I
am often able to read from the page of life while I stand
among them, and sometimes I sit upon a truss of hay, with
several men round me, listening to its teachings.</p>
  <p>" The migratory habits of the men, and the difficulty in
the way of forming an acquaintance with them sufficiently
intimate to be able to report faithfully, will prevent much
being known till the day of the Lord shall declare it. But,
though this is the case, it has pleased the Lord to strengthen
and encourage me with several proofs that he is the faithful
God.</p>
 <p> "Mr. --, who lived at -,         street, is a horse-
keeper. He has four children. He rejected my tracts with
oaths when I first went into his yard, and his wife refused
to admit me into the house. Their opposition gradually
gave way, and I induced the wife to attend my meeting.





<pb id="p.240" n="240"/>

Soon after they expressed a wish for a <title>Bible</title>, and I gave
them one. I had the pleasure of knowing that it was often
read. I went to see them one Sunday afternoon. After
I had closed my <title>Bible</title>, he said to me, ' There is one thing
that has lately made us miserable,-it is that we are not
married, and God is angry with us. Soon after you gave
us the <title>Bible</title>, we began to save up our money to be married
with, but the children were taken bad with the fever, and
we spent it.' As I saw that to live longer in sin was bitter
to them, I mentioned their case to the Rector, who kindly
married them free of expense.  The Sunday after their
wedding I called upon them. As I entered the room,
I said, 'Well, Mr. -  , are you happy?' 'Yes, Sir,' he
replied; 'I was never so happy in my life. Thank God
that you came to see us.' His wife then joined in the conversation. She kissed the youngest child, which was in her
lap, and said, ' I love my children better. I feel as if I had
a right to them. I am so happy that I am a wife.' He has
left off both drinking and swearing, and their home has
much improved. A short time back I was visiting a bedridden old woman, who had been moved into the house.
She remarked to me, 'that God was very kind in sending
her there, as the horsekeeper's wife, who lived up stairs,
came down and read out of the <title>Bible</title> to her every evening.'
This I considered as a pleasing circumstance, and as manifesting a sign of spiritual life. The cases of both husband
and wife are decidedly hopeful.</p>
<p>  " A man, named --, worked in one of the yards. He
never opposed me, but from the first received the Word
gladly. He had not been into the house of prayer for six
years, and he was fearfully ignorant of Divine truth. I was
interested one day with something he said to me, and I
asked him if he read his <title>Bible</title>, as he appeared to know more
than he once did about Gospel truths. ' I can't get time to





                             <pb id="p.241" n="241"/>

 read the <title>Bible</title>, Sir,' he replied; ' but since you came among
 us, I'll tell you what I do. I get my horses forward on
 Sunday evenings, so that I have half an hour before changing
 horses for myself.  I then run round the corner to the
<placeName key=" Methodist Chapel"> Methodist Chapel</placeName>, and stand in at the door while the
 sermon is going on.' The man continued to do this for
 many months, and there was a visible change in his life and
 conversation. He has lately left my district.</p>
   <p>"Mr. --   , who lived at -,       street, is a coarse,
ignorant man. He worked in one of the yards. I frequently
spoke to him about his soul and the Saviour, but was unable
to get on friendly terms with him. One day the woman
he lived unlawfully with run after me in the street, and said
that her husband had poisoned his hand, and that the doctor
had told him he was in danger of losing his life. She
added, that he had asked several of the men 'to look out for
the parson that goes about, and get him to come and read
his Book to him.' I went immediately, and found him
anxious to be instructed in the things of God.  I was
pleased to discover that words I had dropped in the yards
were remembered by him. I visited him through a long
illness, and induced him to separate from the woman he was
living with. A moral change was the result of my efforts,
but more than this I am unable to say.</p>
  <p>" The condition of these men is worse than it formerly
was. The horse-keepers, some five or six years back, used
to have half of every other Sunday for themselves. Three
years back they had half of every fourth Sunday; but
during the time the Exhibition was opened this small boon
was taken from them, and has not since been restored. I
feel strongly on behalf of these oppressed men. I think
their condition a disgrace to us as a Christian people. When
I meet with men opposed to the proper observance of the
Christian Sabbath, I point them to the condition of these





<pb id="p.242" n="242"/>

horse-keepers, as a proof of the baneful influences of unin-
terrupted toil, and also as a proof of the mercy of God in
protecting the poor man's Sabbath with all the power of a
Divine sanction: (In it thou shalt do no manner of work,
thou nor thy servant. "
</p>
  </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="The Introduction of Omnibuses has brought more together the different Parts of London" id="c4s29"><head>The Introduction of Omnibuses has brought more together
              the different Parts of London.</head>
  <p>There is one result which has followed from the establish-
ment of London omnibuses, which calls for a concluding
remark.   It has removed to a great extent the barrier
which previously existed between one part of the metropolis
and the other. " <placeName key="The West-end">The West-end</placeName>," before omnibus days had
arrived, was far more distinct from the East than since.
It was only rarely visited, except by its own residents and
their friends. But now, the West has become familiar to
all, and is most extensively resorted to for purposes of both
trade and pleasure. That which omnibuses have effected in
this respect is precisely what it is so desirable should be
effected on behalf of omnibus-men. They ask that other
classes should acquaint themselves with their position, in
order that pity may be exercised towards them, and the
charitable hand of Christian benevolence stretched out for
their aid.</p>

                  </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Concluding Appeal" id="c4s30"><head>  Concluding Appeal.</head>
   <p>Far more needs to be done for their welfare. They have
been too long neglected and forgotten, as a class. They
have carried Christians in their omnibuses, but Christians
have little carried them in their hearts. Are they some-
times rude and unmannered ? What else could be expected
in men who are so deprived of time and opportunity for
improvement ? Instead of these circumstances hardening us
against their instruction, they only illustrate how urgently




 <pb id="p.243" n="243"/>

this instruction is needed. <title>The Gospel</title> will elevate them.
They are now estranged from, and unacquainted with, its
blessings. Let our readers consider for a moment how it
would be with them, if they were thus situated,-if they
had no Sabbaths,-if they could never enter the house of
God,-if they were robbed of almost every endearment
of social life, and through a long London winter, saw their
children only asleep,-if they had only the public-house
in which to take shelter from the wet, and cold, and fatigue,
of the sixteen hours' daily labour,-if they were treated with
almost constant scorn and suspicion, and had as their asso-
ciates only those whose position was alike disadvantageous.
It is easy to blame these men, but how would it have been with
ourselves ? God in his great goodness has dealt more mercifully
with us. His providence has cast our lot more favourably;
and his grace alone has made us to differ. But these men
are our brethren. They minister to our comforts. They have
introduced a new order of convenience and luxury, which
would have surprised a former generation. Let us, then,
consider them as above their cattle, and as possessed of souls
in value equal to our own. And let us not be unmindful to
provide for them means by which their peculiar snares may
not prove their eternal ruin, but by which their souls may
be sanctified and fitted for glory.

<p>FROM a careful inquiry made in <date value="1851">1851</date>, by the missionaries
of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName>, it was ascertained that about
one family in every seven of the families under their visita-
tion was Irish and Roman Catholic. And it appears fair to
assume that the proportion in the remaining visitable parts
of the metropolis is much the same. Among the operative
classes in London, therefore, nearly 200,000 belong to this
class. It is the largest class which exists among our teeming
population. No other class at all approaches to it. Two towns
only in all England number more people, with all classes
combined, than the Irish poor alone of London. The num-
ber is one-fifth of what the whole of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> itself contained
but two centuries since, and one-tenth of the entire popula-
tion at only the commencement of the last century. The
metropolis of England probably numbers more Irishmen






<pb id="p.246" n="246"/>

among its inhabitants than the metropolis of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> itself.
The Irish population of London equals the entire population
of the three next largest towns of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, viz., <placeName key="Cork">Cork</placeName>,
<placeName key="Belfast">Belfast</placeName>, and <placeName key="Limerick">Limerick</placeName>. <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> would require to give up
entire a dozen other of her largest towns to make up the
numbers of the poor Irish in London. So vast a class, all
immigrants who have traversed the ocean to reach us,
renders a brief allusion to their own country, and its history
and condition, important at the onset.

  <p>The mere fact that, according to an estimate made in
<date value="1831">1831</date>, 5,340,736 out of 14,603,473 statute acres are waste
and unprofitable, illustrates how little of industry and enter-
prise there has been in that unhappy country. And the
decrease of its population in only ten years, from <date value="1841">1841</date>
to <date value="1851">1851</date>, by 1,659,350,-a number in itself greater than the
entire population of the island in <date value="1731">1731</date>,-illustrates how
fearful must have been its recent sufferings.</p>
  <p>Yet <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> possesses as a country great natural advan-
tages. Its climate is, generally, conducive to health, being
free from those extremes to which large tracts of land are
subjected. Great facilities are afforded to commerce,
scarcely any part of the large island being more than 50
miles distant from the sea, and the moisture which this
circumstance occasions is favourable to tillage, while it cre-
ates, with mountain scenery and extensive lakes, natural
beauties which, in themselves, are calculated to attract the
tourist from our own shores, to spend a portion of his time
and his savings on Erin's shores.</p>
<p>  The Irish race also possess many decidedly interesting
and valuable characteristics. Their origin is Celtic, and
they are descendants of the brave and renowned Gauls.
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> was not peopled from Britain, although the two are

in such proximity to each other, neither has its history at all
resembled our own. Not a single Roman is supposed to
have set foot on Irish ground for nearly 400 years after the
Romans had military possession of Britain.

  <p>Christianity was introduced into <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> at a somewhat
earlier period than with ourselves. This was the work of
 <persName key="Patrick, Saint">St. Patrick</persName>, in the year 432. Before that time, although
some few of the Irish had embraced the new religion, the
great mass of them were heathens. There is so much of
legend which has been since mixed up with the life of this
saint, that it is now difficult, or, rather, impossible, to ascer-
tain the facts of his history and mission. It would appear,
however, that civilization and art had for so early an age
made previously some progress in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, and that there
was a general, warm, and almost enthusiastic reception of the
efforts of the apostle. The form of Church government
which he introduced was Episcopal. Art and civilization
still further advanced after Christianity was received, and
the two or three succeeding centuries were probably the
most prosperous epoch in the history of the country.

<p>   The government of the island was monarchical, but the

 <p> At length the King of Leinster, being expelled from his

<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> to <persName key="Henry">Henry</persName>, on the condition that he compelled every

held it as a fief of the Church. <persName key="Pope Adrian IV">The Pope</persName> therefore gave
his ready consent to the restoration of the exiled ruler. An
armament was fitted out, and the English, in <date value="1174">1174</date>, con-

received the submission of the King of that country, as well

have taken the title of " King of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>." <note place="foot" n="1">For some period, however, they were called only "Lords of
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>."
</note>  </p>
<p>The country
was at this period portioned out among the English con-

introduced. By the time of <persName key="Edward IV">Edward IV</persName>., a law of this
description had been passed:-" That it be lawful to all
manner of men who find any thieves robbing by day or night,
or going or coming to rob or steal, or any persons going or
coming, having no faithful men of good name and fame in
their company in English apparel, that it shall be lawful to
take and kill those, and to cut off their heads, without any
impeachment of our Sovereign Lord the King. And of any
head so cut off in the county of Meath, that the cutter and
his ayders there to him, cause the said head so cut off to be
brought to the portreffe to put it upon a stake, or spear,
upon the castle of Trim; and that the said portreffe shall
testify the bringing of the same to him. And that it shall
be lawful for the said bringer of the said head to distrain
and levy by his own hand (as his reward) of every man
having half a ploughland, one penny; and of every man
having one house and goods, value 40 shillings, one penny;
and of every other cottier having house and smoak, one half-
penny."  " Here was a fruitful source of murder! All the
evidence required of the cutter of the head was, that it was




                             <pb id="p.249" n="249"/>

the head of a Milesian, or Irishman; that the man was not
in company with any of the English settlers; and that, in
his opinion, he was 'going to, or coming from, some bad
errand.' " <note place="foot" n="2"><persName key="Taaffe">Taaffe's</persName> <title>" History of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>."</title></note>
</p>  <p>In the same year, in <date value="1478">1478</date>, an Act was passed, called
<title>"The Apparel and Surname Act,"</title> compelling the Irish to
dress like the English and to adopt their surnames.
  "For some centuries after the settlement of the English,
efforts to improve the people by religion and literary educa-
tion were conducted on a principle as unjust as impolitic.
All attempts at bettering their condition were limited to the
English settlers or the inhabitants of the pale, those of the
rest of the island being treated as enemies. To such a height
was the distinction carried, that whilst the murder of an
Englishman was death, that of a native was suffered to go
unpunished, provided that it could be proved he was mere
Irish, and not one of the 5 bloods of the O'Neills,
O'Melaghlins, O'Connors, O'Briens, and M'Marroughs,

place.  Until our conquest of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, in the reign of
<persName key="Henry II">Henry II</persName>., <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, like England, had retained much inde-

privilege was, however, afterwards ceded by succeeding
English Kings, who did not care to sacrifice for <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> what
they were jealous of for England, and which established the
connexion of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> more closely than that of England with
<placeName key="Rome">Rome</placeName>, even although <persName key="Saint Patrick">St. Patrick</persName> had not himself upheld the
superadded doctrines and practices of <placeName key="Rome">Rome</placeName> which the
Reformation again removed. The Pope soon began to tax
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> heavily, which created great distress; and the
bishops appointed by him were equally rapacious and intole-
rant, in imitation of their spiritual head. The consequence
was, that, at the time of the Reformation, " whatever pre-
tensions may have been justly advanced by <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, in pre-
vious ages, to the title of ' the island of saints,' an examina-
tion of its subsequent condition shows that its profession of

a burden of corruption and error."</p>
   <p>" It was by the abrogation of the Papal supremacy and
the assertion of the Sovereign's right to the undivided
dominion over all his subjects, as well ecclesiastical as civil,
that the first advance was made towards the reformation of

different national origin or parentage; the hereditary anti-
pathy in the descendants of the earlier inhabitants against
the Sovereign, as not of indigenous extraction, nor a native
of the soil; their prevalent disposition to indulge in resist-
ance to his authority, and to seek assistance from foreign
powers to support them in their resistance; the remoteness
of their situation, which rendered them less accessible to the
visitations of the King's power, and less fearful of his indig-
nation; their continual intestine agitations, which had indis-
posed the mind, and afforded little convenient occasion for
speculative inquiries and for intellectual or spiritual improve-
ment; the absence of any pervious extraordinary impulse
for directing the mind to seek for knowledge, and the want
of literary institutions for giving efficacy to the impulse, if it
had existed; the people's habitual subjection to their clergy,
and the ignorance of the clergy themselves, and their blind
and superstitious devotion to their ecclesiastical superiors;
the long and deep-rooted prepossession in favour of one who
had pretended to supreme authority in the Church for 3
or 4 centuries, and whose character they had been accus-
tomed to venerate as all but divine; and, with all this, a
persuasion of the fact, that the earliest English King who
had claimed dominion in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> derived his claim, in the

originally, as they were taught to believe, founded on a
power which it now sought to displace and supersede: these

the inhabitants co-operated with the zeal of the Primate in
obstructing the inroad which the dominion of the Sovereign
was attempting to make on that of the Pope." <note place="foot" n="4"> Vol. i., pp. 108, 109.</note></p>
  <p>An Act of Parliament was passed at this time, directing
that spiritual promotions were to be given " only to such as

next market-town, such could not be had."  All who were
appointed had also to take oath that they would teach the
English language and preach only in that tongue, which
rendered the proceedings still more unpopular.

  <p>The degree of prosperity to which <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> attained during
the last half of the 18th century is, however, worthy of

In <date value="1788">1788</date>, Mr. Bushe's estimate of the population was

at about 5,000,000.</p>
   <p>Since then, till recently, the numbers continued to increase
with great rapidity. The first regular census of the popula-
tion was taken in <date value="1821">1821</date>, when it amounted to 6,801,827. In
<date value="1831">1831</date> this was increased to 7,767,401. And in <date value="1841">1841</date> it had

      </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="The pleasing Peculiarities in the irish Character" id="c5s12"><head>The pleasing Peculiarities in the Irish Character.</head>
   <p>The Irish possess distinctive peculiarities of character, in
some respects of an agreeable and interesting nature. These
are described very correctly in an important lecture delivered
on December 6, <date value="1852">1852</date>, on "The Irish in London," at the
Music Hall, Store-street, by the Rev. Samuel Garratt, the
Minister of Trinity Church, Little Queen-street. "Having
(he writes) been engaged for 2 years in labouring in a part
of St. Giles's, crowded with Irish, those who have invited
me to speak on this subject suppose that I ought to know
something about it .... In fact, in what I have to say, I
am obliged from the circumstances of the case to depend
mainly on what I have seen myself, or heard from others
engaged in the work, and especially those zealous co-
operators in every Christian enterprise in this metropolis-
the City missionaries. I cannot refer you for my authority
to books, but if you wish for confirmation, the Irish in
London are our neighbours, and I can at least say this-Go
and see !"  Mr. Garratt then remarks-" A    very little
acquaintance with them is sufficient to discover, in spite of
all their social degradation, a peculiarity of character which
would blend most usefully with that of their Saxon neigh-
bours. The English labourer, with all his manliness and
honesty, is often wanting in intellectual acuteness and in
imaginative glow. In both these characteristics the Irish




             <pb id="p.257" n="257"/>

excel. There is an ingenuity of thought which contrasts
strangely with the clumsiness of hand, and a perception of
what is beautiful which is incongruously associated with the
most total want of all comfort.</p>
  <p>" I do think that a few rays of Irish imagination, a little
more play of fancy, more exuberance of joyousness, and
more brightness of hope, would greatly add to the happiness
of our own poor. They live too much in the present, while
the Irishman lives too exclusively in the future. I would
bring down the one to the present routine of daily duties,
and raise up the other to brighter anticipations. I would
put more good sense into the Irishman, and more poetry into
the Englishman. And in this way I cannot but hope, that
even intellectually, morally, and socially, they may do each
other good; and that the English character, retaining its
own solidity, may acquire the gracefulness of the Irish, and
while equally useful, become more pleasing, demand as much
of our approbation, and more engage our love."</p>
 <p> The remark of Dickens, " An Irishman must be gone to
the bad entirely when he cannot smile," affords an illustra-
tion of Irish character which cannot but be admitted to be
interesting and pleasing. Their constant buoyancy renders
Irishmen often very acceptable as missionaries and Scripture-
readers.  They are seldom heavy or prosy in imparting
instruction, and their address and natural humour will often
gain a hearing to their message, even where prejudice against
it exists.</p>

  <p>Their hospitality and kindly feeling towards their country-
men and kindred are further excellences in which the Irish
stand pre-eminent. The sketch, given by the same excellent
clergyman, of the arrival of an Irishman in London, is quite
characteristic:-

<p>  "Imagine an Irishman just arrived from the green moun-
tains of <placeName key="Kerry">Kerry</placeName>, in <placeName key="Drury-lane">Drury-lane</placeName>. Perhaps he has come alone,
leaving his wife and children to follow, when he has laid up
enough to bring them. And in this case they have to wait
long, for it is seldom that the Irishman earns more than
enough to keep himself alive.  <hi rend="italics">But he does not lose his
affection for them. He says, and says truly, that ' the days
are weeks, and the weeks are months,' till he sees them again.</hi>
Or perhaps he brings them over with him, and the man, and
his wife, and half a dozen shoeless and stockingless children,
are looking about a dark court to find a night's lodging.
They are sure to meet some one with whom they have some
sort of acquaintance or connexion.  Or if not, the Irishman,
HOWEVER POOR, never wants hospitality. They show it in
what seems to us a strange way. The family is all wel-
comed to the fourth corner of a third floor back, in all the
other three corners of which some family is domiciled. The
landlord of this room has let two of the other corners,
keeping the third and fourth for himself; <hi rend="italics">and then, when
these poor 'creatures' are shivering in the cold outside, it
is not in his heart not to let them occupy the fourth corner,
for one night, rent free.</hi> He knows that under the New

room, but he runs that risk, and <hi rend="italics">thinks himself doing right</hi>."</p>

   <p>The exercise of this feeling towards relatives is also accom-

would be a more correct term. But the following extract
from the <title>"Twelfth General Report of the Colonial Land

  <p> "The misery which the Irish have for many years
 endured has destroyed the attachment to their native soil,
 the numbers who have already emigrated and prospered
 remove the apprehension of going to a strange and untried
 country, <hi rend="italics">while the want of means is remedied by the liberal
 contributions of their relations and friends who have preceded
 them.  The contributions so made, either in the form of pre-

  <p>Nor, indeed, ought that unfavourable judgment to be
passed on the Irish, on account of the crowded state of their
rooms, which, at the first blush of the matter, we might be
disposed to do.  Mr. Garratt remarks very truly with
reference to it:-</p>
  <p>" You must not suppose that this wretched way of living
is felt by them to be uncomfortable. They have no taste
for anything different. The misery of an Irish hovel is
proverbial, and though I think that some of them do miss
the hills and the valleys outside, yet the accommodation
inside is not worse than they have been accustomed to.
Their habits are set immeasurably lower, as far as the
comforts and decencies of life are concerned, than those
of our English poor. And it is one great problem which
is ever occurring to the mind of the thoughtful observer,
how they can be raised."</p>
  <p>It is also especially to be noticed, to the honour of the
Irish, that, in spite of this crowded and promiscuous living
and sleeping, as a nation they are, as to all offences against
purity, more virtuous and moral than our own poor, and it
is only as they become corrupted by a long residence in
London, that offences against the seventh commandment
become common among them. In their own country they
are an example to us. Violations of the marriage tie are
there almost unknown, an illegitimate child can scarcely be
found, and young women who have committed themselves are
scouted society in a manner which has no parallel in England
among the same classes of the population.

</div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Even the Good Qualities of the Irish cause them especially to need Faithful and Judicious Counsel and Visitation" id="c5s16"><head>Even the Good Qualities of the Irish cause them especially to

  <p>But there is a dark as well as a light side to the picture.





                             <pb id="p.261" n="261"/>

Even the natural good qualities of the Irish require disci-
pline and the frequent word of the faithful and judicious
friend to prevent their leading them astray. They have,
for example, great fluency in speaking, and express them-
selves with far more ease and gracefulness than the English.
They are never at a loss for words, and they speak with a
glow and warmth which reaches the heart. Now even the
most phlegmatic Englishman is sensible of the truth of the
sayings of<persName key="Saint James"> St. James</persName>, that the tongue, although so little a
member, is always ready to "boast great things," is more
difficult to control than the mighty ships " driven of fierce
winds," or to tame than the most unruly " beast, or bird, or
serpent," and, like a small spark, kindles a great fire. Is it
to be wondered at, then, that, in reference to the natives of
the sister isle, the expression has become a proverbial one
among ourselves-" Irish brawls?"</p>
 <p> So, also, the Irish excel the English in their imaginative
faculties. But what valuable talent can more need to be
directed aright, and what class of persons more require a
Christian visitor of judgment and experience, than those
who have been possessed by God with such a gift ?</p>

  <p>Then again, a large number of the Irish in London are as
strangers in, to them, a strange land. Dire necessity has
driven most of them here, and others of them have come
possibly to escape from oppression and priestcraft. And
God represents that He himself is the patron of such, and
that we are to be imitators of Him towards them. " The
Lord loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.
Love ye therefore the stranger."  "If a stranger sojourn
with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him. But the
stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one
born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself.... I

am the Lord your God."<note place="foot" n="1"> Deut. x. 18, 19; Levit. xix. 33, 34.</note>     If under so exclusive and
restrictive a dispensation as the Jewish, these were to be the
laws for their governance, how much more binding are they
on ourselves, guided as we are by the far more liberal spirit
of the new economy! Is it not also a matter of honour to
us that we should be a refuge to the distressed and the
oppressed? And in our idea of "refuge," what Christian
heart must not include a refuge for the soul no less than for
the body? Nor ought we to forget to ask whether we have
not ourselves, as a nation, been guilty parties in occasioning
very much of the misery which the Irish have endured.
They are, moreover, although strangers, yet our own fellow-
subjects, having resorted to us from a kingdom which we
have agreed to consider as "united" to ourselves, and
entitled to all our immunities, privileges, and advantages.

               London in their rudest form.</head>
  <p>The extreme ignorance in which the poor Irish have been
left in their own country gives us illustrations of a fine
natural character, only in its rudest, wildest, most uncivi-
lized and undisciplined form. They are about as ignorant
of the Gospel as if they had come from some heathen land,
for the priests in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> teach less even than the priests in
England.</p>
  <p>" For the most part, the native Irish of London know
nothing. They cannot express one dogma of their faith
distinctly, and are not at all acquainted with those distinc-
tions in which the Roman Catholic poor in this country are
trained. You must speak to them as if they were children.
And they are more easily reached by the heart than the
head. .. <hi rend="italics">Very few of them have seen, and fewer still possess,

as the Word of God, and seem quite unconscious of the
difference. They take their religion from the priest, and
obedience to the priest is the chief part of their religion.
So long as they remain Romanists, they are incapable of
being affected with arguments, and when they become Pro.
testants it is difficult to keep them from transferring to the
minister the same blind faith which they have reposed in the
priest." <note place="foot" n="1"><persName key="Garrat">Garratt's</persName> <title>"Irish in London,"</title> pp. 190, 197.

</div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="How Popery has Marred and Debased the Irish Character" id="c5s19"><head>How Popery has Marred and Debased the Irish Character.</head>
 <p> But Popery does more than leave fallow the mind.
Wherever it exists, it debases the character of the people.
And it has done so with the Irish, as it would have done
with us, if God in his great mercy had not delivered us
from the oppression. Just as in <placeName key="Switzerland">Switzerland</placeName>, the very
appearance of the country, of the houses, and of the people,
will determine whether the cantons through which you are
passing are Protestant or Romish, so is it in the smaller
cantons of the courts, and alleys, and streets of London, in
which English and Irish respectively, and ordinarily dis-
tinctively and with little admixture with each other, fix
their habitations.</p>
  <p>The worst parts in the character of the Irish of London
are, that they are idle and dirty; that they are without that
honourable independence of mind which is so valuable a
feature in the English character; that they are essentially
disloyal, and that their feelings towards our Protestant
population are those of animosity, persecution, and cruelty.
These are the peculiarly dark spots in their picture,-and
these are simply and only the stamp which Popery has
placed on them, to manifest that they are hers.   They
are " the marks of the beast," in every place and in every
age. And it is these repulsive points which render the





<pb id="p.264" n="264"/>
Irish  so unpopular with our own working-classes, and
to a certain extent, with our Protestant population in
general. Indeed, where Popery is bereft of outward power,
as in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, and is yet largely developed, it reveals some of
its most odious qualities more glaringly than under other
circumstances. The antagonistic form which it is there led
to assume develops a coarseness, a rancour, and a disregard
of human laws, which sleep under more quiet developments.
When Popery in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> is contrasted with Popery in most
of the countries of Europe, these distinctions will, we
apprehend, be admitted by all.</p>
  <p>The design which led to the endowment by the nation
of <orgName key="Maynooth College">Maynooth College</orgName>, in which the Irish priests should be
educated rather than be allured to <placeName key="France">France</placeName> or other conti-
nental nations for that purpose, appeared fair. But without
entering into the question of the policy being strictly
right or wrong, or of the general arguments adduced for or
against its continuance, there is too much reason to believe
that the following statement of a writer favourable to the
continuance of the grant is correct: "If candidates for the
Irish priesthood had continued to go for education to the
Continent, the mere expenses they would have had to incur
would have secured to the Church the sons of respectable
people. With an opportunity of mixing with foreigners,
their manners would have been polished, and their ideas
enlarged. Indeed, in the French school of theology, at
<orgName key="St. Omer">St. Omer</orgName>, there is very little of what is called 'ultra-
montanism.'  On their return they would have been fit
to enter into the very best society of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, an intercourse
of which the advantages would evidently have been recipro-
cal. But in the cheap manufacture of priests at <orgName key="Maynooth College">Maynooth</orgName>,
instead-like our young Protestant clergy at <placeName key="Oxford">Oxford</placeName> and
<placeName key="Cambridge">Cambridge</placeName>-of enjoying the advantages of association with

               .                <pb id="p.265" n="265"/>

is exclusively confined to themselves; . . . and as their life
is evidently divested of all refined intellectual enjoyments,
none but the sons of small needy farmers and small shop-
keepers are willing to embark in it. And thus it may
be confidently asserted that among the whole of the Irish
priesthood there scarcely exists the son of a gentleman ....
In the class-books, ultramontane principles are irrevocably
implanted in their heads, their discipline breaks down
their minds, abject subjection to their superiors crushes
their spirits; in fact, not only is the system altogether one of
utter slavery, but it ends in the slave becoming a tyrant."<note place="foot" n="1"><persName key="Head, Sir Francis">Sir Francis Head's </persName>"<title> Fortnight in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>,"</title> pp. 394-5.</note></p>
  <p>The recent addition to the Maynooth grant has increased
the number of priests in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, which was not needed, as
the population has decreased, instead of increasing the
quality of the education imparted.</p>
 <p> But to refer more in detail to these failings of the Irish:-
"It is not his being a Celt that makes the Irishman in
London what he is.    There is nothing in Irish air or
Irish birth that is unproductive of energy, or industry, or
truth.  <persName key="Wellington">Wellington</persName> was an Irishman; and among those
whose names are held in honour and respectful love in our
own Church, for bold straightforwardness, as well as manly
eloquence and Christian love, are some whose very names
declare them Celts. It is not Irish air in infancy, or Celtic
parentage that has made the Irish in London what they are.
It is nothing else but the withering curse of that anti-Chris-
tian system, which blights where it falls, and through the
soul itself crushes and tramples on the man. .. . <placeName key="Rome">Rome</placeName>'s
religion unmans a nation. It produces a slothful, indolent,

untruthful spirit...   This influence of the Romish system

  <p>"The Irishman has not been long in London before he
finds reason to wish himself back again ..... Nothing is to
be done here without strenuous exertion. And though an
Irishman sometimes works hard when he is at work, he
never likes hard work. He is too fond of talking, and
smoking, and drinking, and shrinks from exertion.<note place="foot" n="1">While I give this extract from Mr. Garratt as true with reference

likely he knows no trade, and if he does, an English artizan
will hardly work with him. Our poor Irish neighbours feel
most keenly the dislike in which they are held. It does
exist to a great extent, and they exaggerate it.....</p>
 <p> "The Irish Roman Catholics neither love labour nor love

  <p>The same feeling renders them so ready to enter a work-

for years, in order to send money to enable their wives and
children, and even their brothers and sisters, when in the

They will save to be able to remit money for the relief of

expense of their marriage, an expense the English so fre-

either themselves or their children from the degradation of
a workhouse; indeed they often, with the means of inde-
pendence secreted on their persons, apply for parish relief,
and that principally to save the expenditure of their own
money. Even when detected in such an attempt at extor-
tion, an Irishman betrays no passion, and hardly manifests
any emotion-he has speculated and failed. Not one of

and owns an authority paramount to hers. The following is
a quotation I have met with from the ' Tablet,' the organ of
the Jesuits, respecting the feeling of the Irish Roman

  <p>"' It is strange to witness this new phase of the yearning
wherewith <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> for so many generations has turned her
heart to <placeName key="France">France</placeName>, as to a place from whence cometh help.
We believe of course that the danger of invasion is very
much overrated, but the eye of the peasant glistens when
the name of Louis Napoleon is mentioned, and his heart
bounds when he hears of the coming empire, which in his
mind is the inheritor, not merely of great victories and great
deeds, but of hopes that have been nursed in the sad and
sickly heart of his fathers, and have been handed down to
him as a stern accompaniment of the anguish which eats into
his heart, while with thin and wasted lips he murmurs,
'How long, O Lord, how long ?' Yes, these hopes (how
could it be otherwise under the established rule?) are
nourished in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, and the day when the Vicar of Christ-
if this too, as it seems probable is to happen-shall place the
Imperial Crown upon the brow of the third Napoleon, and
give him the benediction of the Church, will bring joy and
exultation and hope to the down-trodden peasant of this
land.'</p>
  <p>"The ' Tablet' writes of the Irish in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>. But it is
equally true, though not equally known, of the Irish in
London. The Roman Catholic masses in the heart of this
metropolis are bound by no tie of affectionate loyalty to our
Queen and country. England is to them but a foreign land.
They look on the Emperor of the French as the Protector of
Romanism, and it would not grieve them to see him triumph
over a nation of heretics. Such is the state of feeling of
Irish Roman Catholics in London. But on the other hand,





                           <pb id="p.269" n="269"/>

no sooner does an Irishman become a Protestant, than he
becomes also loyal to his Queen, and attached to his country.
From that moment he looks on his own interest and that
of this nation as one, and he counts himself as much con-
cerned in the safety and honour of England, as if he were an
Englishman. I simply state the fact. It is one which
would be confirmed by every one who knows the heart of
the Irish in London. They belong to us nationally or not,
as they belong to us religiously or not. The neglect of all
effort, for centuries past, to lead these degraded masses into
the light and liberty of the <title>Gospel</title>, has resulted in leaving,
in the very heart of London, a population, living in the
midst of us, but estranged from our religion, our laws, our
manners, and our Government."<note place="foot" n="1"><persName key="Garratt's">Garratt's</persName> <title>"Irish in London,"</title> pp. 203-4.</note></p>
  <p>That disloyalty of the Irish which gives them a sympathy
with a French Emperor rather than an English Queen is
further illustrated in the following most remarkable quotation
from the "Fifth Letter to the People of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>," by a
popular Romish Priest, who has recently been preaching
much in London, the <persName key="Cahill, Rev. Dr.">Rev. Dr. Cahill</persName>:-</p>
  <p>"'Depend upon it that England has sapped her own
foundations; depend upon me that <placeName key="France">France</placeName> is not settled, and
that Europe owes England a grudge, which never will or
can be forgiven. Be convinced that, if <persName key="Prince Albert">Prince Albert</persName>
originated 100 Exhibitions, and that the London corporation
dined, and slept, and lived with the French functionaries
every day and night for 7 years-be convinced that after all
this display of artful civilities there is not one Frenchman or
one Frenchwoman, or one French child, who would not dance
with frantic joy at the glorious idea of having an opportunity
before they die of burying their eager swords and plunging
the crimsoned French steel into the inmost heart of every
man bearing the hated name of Englishman. Therefore,





<pb id="p.270" n="270"/>
keep up your courage, and wait your opportunity in a strictly
legal attitude, and England will be very soon in your power."</p>
  <p>It is still mope remarkable and deplorable that similar
language to this has been addressed to the Irish very
generally by the priests throughout London during the past
year, in the pulpits of Romish Chapels. More, in fact, is
expected by the poor Irish in London in general from the
French than from the English, and the sympathy of the
nation is more decidedly with <placeName key="France">France</placeName> than with England.</p>
  <p> Such facts illustrate the truth of the remark of the
"Times" on  <date value="1853-03-03">March 3,1853</date>,--"We very much doubt
whether in England, or indeed in any free Protestant
country, a true Papist can be a good subject. But if all
this had been avowed some years ago, the opportunities of
Popery would never have been what they are."</p>

   <p>The old spirit which lit up the fires of Smithfield against
Protestants is also most prevalent among the Irish. As
illustrations, the following extracts from the last two Annual
Reports of one of the Surrey Chapel missionaries are
given:-</p>
  <p>"Report, <date value="1852">1852</date>.-The deluded creatures in Glass-house-
yard are nearly all Irish, and the appearance of a Protestant
among them immediately excites their anger. If they could
secretly murder him they would not hesitate to do so. Even
the children are taught to watch my movements, and their
parents will grind their teeth at me as I pass their doors. One
woman said recently, ' If you intend to come here you had
better order your coffin.' In <placeName key="Gravel-lane">Gravel-lane</placeName> there is an Infant
School belonging to the Established Church, and the Roman
Catholic children, no doubt prompted by their parents, are
constantly breaking the windows by throwing stones. A
few days since, the door was burst open, and a donkey put in





                               <pb id="p.271" n="271"/>

at the door.  Ewer-street runs out of Gravel-lane into
Union-street. Whenever I enter the streets I am narrowly
watched. If I give them a tract, some of them will light
their pipes with it. Others will shout out, ' Here comes the
-    missionary ! Here is the Government spy ! Here is
the tormentor !'</p>
  <p>" An Irishman recently said to me, 'Here you are again,
bad luck to ye. We have no pace hare for the like of ye.
Faith, and we war never so tarmented in our lives before.
Och! and I should like to roast ye, and all the like of ye!
Oh, wouldent I like to have the kindling of the fire, and a
drap of whisky over the fun. The curses of <persName key="Saint Michael">St. Michael</persName>
be upon ye for iver and iver !'</p>
  <p>" Another Irishman accosted me in the street, and said,
'Are you the priest?' 'You know I am not,' I replied.
'In whose name then do you come here ?' 'In the name of
the Great High Priest, King Jesus!' 'By the blessed
Virgin, and holy <persName key="Saint Patrick">St. Patrick</persName>, and by Jasus ye shall not go
down here, heretic as ye are, if ye do I will stab you to the
very heart;' and he presented a knife with a sharp point,
and dared me to stir a step farther. I told him he had
no right to stop me on the Queen's highway, and I was
determined, whatever might be the consequences, not to be
prevented from doing my duty, and rushed past him. He
followed me, gnashing his teeth, and uttering the most awful
imprecations. An old woman cried out, 'Why did you not
rid the world of an inimy, and do God a sarvice ?' ' Sure,'
said he, 'and if it had not been for my own neck I would,
but the - Protestant Government would have been after
me, bad luck to them.'</p>
  <p>" In <placeName key="Ewer-Street">Ewer-street</placeName>, where I occasionally visit a sick person,
I have had as many as six dogs set at me, but through the
mercy of the Lord they were not permitted to injure
me.</p>





<pb id="p.272" n="272"/>
  <p>" The foregoing are some of the difficulties which I have
had to contend with."</p>
  <p>" Report, <date value="1853">1853</date>.-In my Report of last year I mentioned
the case of a man who threatened to murder me. Near the
same spot an Irishwoman cried out this year, ' Oh, you --
--, should we not like to have our will of you ? and you
must look out that we do not. We should like to have the
roasting of your Protestant heart.'</p>
 <p> " I offered one of the bills on the Crystal Palace to
an Irishman, and he said, ' And is it the Crystal Palace you
would keep shut; sure, and cannot we go to mass, and then
go to Sydenham in the afternoon; and should we get a drop
of whisky too much, would not our priest forgive us?
Ah, you Protestants have no such privilege. I tell you
candidly, it is not going to the Crystal Palace, but being
heretics that will damn you all. I only wish we had the
power as they have where Francisco is imprisoned, and we
would not only confine you, but put you into the Crystal
Palace, set fire to it, and blow you all to hell together. And
it would be the greatest service done to God and his Church
since the times of good Queen Mary!'</p>
  <p>" Another said, ' Isay, you Protestant, then you still keep
on in your hellish work ! Ah  the day will come when you
and all the like of you will sorely rue the day that ever you
circulated that book of yours.' [I really cannot repeat what
he called the <title>Bible</title>, the terms he applied to it were so dread-
ful.] 'I don't know a bigger enemy than you, because you
are always telling the people to search it. And take you
missionaries all together, you are worse than an army of
soldiers against our Church. You have completely inun-
dated this neighbourhood with that book of yours. May
the Lord reward you for your pains and your obstinacy!
Many an Ave Maria have I forwarded to the upper world
for the destruction of you all.'</p>

meet with no direct opposition from others. Although they
are awfully indifferent to the truths of the Gospel, I meet
with civility and respect from the most abandoned."</p>
  <p>The following case, which recently occurred to a woman
who had been under the visitation of a London City mis-
sionary, and who had eventually renounced Popery, illus-

your soul to the devil?'  She replied, that she did not
think that she had; upon which he walked out of the room.
He returned, however, in about three or four minutes in a
passion; struck her three times with the umbrella, in the
landlady's presence, and said to her, 'Why don't you send
those devils out of your house ?' The landlady at first said

in her arms, on being sworn said: 'I am the wife of <persName key="Murphy, Michael">Michael Murphy</persName>, a labourer. On Friday fortnight I was living in
Palmer's-rents, <placeName key="Snow's-fields">Snow's-fields</placeName>, and <persName key="Harrington, Mrs.">Mrs. Harrington</persName> was my
landlady. A <persName key="Winter, Mrs.">Mrs. Winter</persName> and <persName key="Geeham, Mrs.">Mrs. Geeham</persName> lodged there
also; and I slept in the kitchen which they all used. I was
confined not quite three weeks, and had not been out of bed,
only to the fire. I know the defendant: he is a clergyman;
and I saw him before and after I was confined... On the
Friday in question defendant came into the room, and asked
me, "Did I get my child baptized ?" I replied, that I did.
He asked whether it was himself who did it? I replied
that it was not; but it was Dr. Armstrong. He is a Pro-
testant, and myself and my husband belong to his congrega-
tion. Defendant said, "Did you sell your soul to the
devil ?" I told him I considered I had not; when he struck
me on the left ear with his umbrella. I think in my mind
that he was very angry. He went out to the next house,





                         <pb id="p.275" n="275"/>

and returned in a few moments, when he struck me then
three times, and I called out for mercy, as the last stroke
hurt me. I told him my head was so bad I could not bear it.
I was quite weak and ill at the time. As he was going out
of the house he cursed me in Irish, and said to Mrs. Har.
rington, " Get the devils out of your house." She said she
would, and took the bed away from me, and I was compelled
to sleep on the floor.'</p>
  <p>" Cross-examined by Mr. Woollett, who appeared for the
defendant.-I came from <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> about 3 years ago, and
went with my parents into Wales.    They are Roman
Catholics, and I was such until I married.  I came to
Bermondsey a month before last harvest, and had been at
Mrs. Harrington's about 6 weeks, and was to pay her Is. 6d.
per week. I first knew Mr. Donovan 3 nights after I was
confined, when he came to check a man who had troubled
me. The police could not take him or quiet him. That
was the reason he was sent for. The defendant then left
1s. for me, but I did not speak to him. I owed Mrs.
Harrington a little rent, but she did not look for it until
defendant beat me and told her to turn me out ..</p>
  <p>"Mary Harrington, the landlady of the house, cross-
examined by Mr. Robinson for the plaintiff.-Did not
defendant tell you to pitch those devils out of the house?</p>
 <p> "Witness.-Yes, he did, in a very civil manner.</p>
 <p> " Mr. Robinson.-And you took the bed from under her
immediately after that.</p>
  <p>"Witness.-I did; but she did not sleep on the floor, she
slept on the sacking with her clothes on.</p>
  <p>" Mr. Sweatman, a surgeon, residing at <placeName key="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</placeName>, a
member of the Established Church, said, he had known
defendant from a boy, and he was a very amiable and kind-
hearted gentleman, liberal in the extreme, and very inoffen-
sive in his manner.</p>






<pb id="p.276" n="276"/>

  <p>"Mr. Kirwan, of <placeName key="George-street">George-street</placeName>, <placeName key="Manchester-square">Manchester-square</placeName>, also
spoke in high terms of him, as did Mr. Joseph Luke, of
<placeName key="Claremont-street, Pentonville,">Claremont-street, Pentonville,</placeName> and Miss Isabella Stephens,
of <placeName key="Maze-park, Bermondsey">Maze-park, Bermondsey </placeName>, with whom defendant lodged for
some time.</p>
 <p> "Mr. Robinson then addressed the Jury in reply, con-
tending that after what the woman had said, the charge had
assumed a more serious aspect. No doubt his character was
respectable, but they were there to suppress the domination
of priests, which now they had a clear proof of, leading them
to believe that he exercised a power over his flock which
was far superior to the civil authority of the land.</p>
  <p>" The CHAIRMAN then summed up the case at great length,
reading over the evidence carefully. There were two points
for the consideration of the Jury. They must first be satisfied
that an assault had been committed, and if so, whether there
was any justification. They had heard the whole of the
evidence, and it would be for them to consider whether the
defendant was guilty or not.</p>
  <p>" The Jury consulted for about 20 minutes, and returned
a verdict of guilty.</p>
<p>  " Mr. Robinson said he was instructed not to press for
any severe punishment, as his party had no vindictive
feeling towards the defendant. There could be no doubt
that the assault was committed in a moment of excitement,
therefore he had no wish to aggravate the case.</p>
  <p> " The foreman of the Jury said they wished to recommend
the defendant to mercy.</p>
   <p>"The CHAIRMAN said, it gave him great pain to pass
sentence on a person of the defendant's position in life, but
the Court as well as the Jury were of opinion that not only
an assault had been committed, but 8 aggravated assaults
were proved upon a poor weak woman. It was an act of
religious persecution which no minister of any denomination





                           <pb id="p.277" n="277"/>

could be allowed to exercise in this free country.  The
defendant had no right to chastise any one on such grounds,
and had not the prosecutrix and the Jury recommended him
to mercy, the Court would have committed him to prison
without a fine. Had it been a Protestant minister or
Dissenter, the Court would have done the same, as such
conduct would not be tolerated in this country. The Court
would take into consideration the recommendation, and
inflict a penalty of 51. on him.</p>
   <p>" The fine was immediately paid amid the execrations of
the mob and dreadful howling of the women, who were in a
most excited state, so much so that both the defendant and
his accuser were obliged to be sent out privately through the
gaol."</p>
 <p> A weekly newspaper thus commented on the occurrence,-
  "' A woman has become a Protestant, and her child has
been baptized in a Protestant Church. O'Donovan, hearing
this, declares that this<persName key="Murphy, Mary"> Mary Murphy</persName> has 'sold herself to
the devil,' at the same time, as if to clench the bargain,
" striking her three times near the left ear with his umbrella.'
This, however, was a mere ebullition. For on cooler con-
sideration O'Donovan calmly ordered the woman's landlady
'to turn the devils out.' And all potent, a Pope in little,
was O'Donovan at the hearth of Mrs. Harrington, the
landlady. Donovan had spoken; and <persName key="Murphy, Mary">Mary Murphy's</persName>
bed was taken away from her, and she and her child (the
baby 3 days old, be it remembered,) slept on the bare floor
that night. O'Donovan, after such pious work, went to his
bed . . meanwhile <persName key="Murphy, Mary">Mary Murphy's</persName>, 3 days delivered, lay on
the bare boards. ... Daniel O'Donovan, we doubt not,
never thought himself more truly a priest than when beating
a woman, weak with travail, striking her 3 times with an
umbrella till she cried for mercy, cursing her in Irish, and
bidding her go to 'the 17 devils.' We believe that the





<pb id="p.278" n="278"/>

exposure of O'Donovan will do much good. He has been
turned inside out, and so exposed looks blacker than even
his gown.   The religion of Christianity is a religion of
protection and shelter. But the O'Donovans, framing it to
their own hands, make it a weapon of wrong and persecu-
tion. In scorching heat and pouring rain O'Donovan has
an umbrella that, in his piety, he may lift above the travail-
worn and sinking, but he bethinks him of no part of the
umbrella but the stick."</p>

 <p> A more important field than is presented by the Irish in

far as numbers are concerned, they present a larger claim
than many of the entire stations of our <orgName key="Foreign Missionary

fifth of the population of the poor Irish of London; while
Greenland, that field of successful missionary enterprise by
the Moravians is less than a twentieth part of the number.
Is it then consistent to send missionaries to those afar off, at
a necessarily great cost, and to pass by those who are
dwelling in the midst of our own metropolis? The one
ought to be done, but the other ought still more not to be
left undone. As 500 families, consisting of about 2,000
individuals, are as many as one lay visitor can take charge
of with any advantage, there are actually one hundred such
faithful men wanted for the Irish alone of London.

The Remarkable Success of Recent Effortsfor the Conversion
of the Irish to the Protestant Faith in their own Country.</p>
  <p>Great encouragement exists for such efforts among the
Irish from the circumstance of the truly marvellous effects
which have within the last few years been accomplished
in the West of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>. They probably exceed what have
been witnessed in any part of England within the memory of
man, if not since the days of the Reformation. The last
Paper of the <orgName key="Irish Church Missions">Irish Church Missions</orgName>, issued in the Autumn
of <date value="1852">1852</date>, states:-</p>
  <p> "This Society was instituted, under its present form and
constitution, in the year <date value="1849">1849</date>. . . . The success which has
attended it is almost without a parallel. With a few agents,
and limited funds, it commenced its labours in the West of
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, soon afterwards in the East, and has since embraced
a large portion of that country  ...</p>
  <p>" The Society's Missions in <placeName key="West Galway">West Galway</placeName> have, under
God's blessing, been the means of rendering a district, extend-
ing 50 miles in length and 30 in breadth, characteristically
Protestant, which but a few years ago was characteristically
Romish. In that district, until lately, there were not more
than 500 Protestants; there are now nearly 6,000 converts
attending Church services. 5,000 children are taught in the
Scriptural schools ....</p>
  <p>" Although there has been much opposition and persecu-
tion exercised by the <orgName key="Church of Rome">Church of Rome</orgName>, yet enemies and
friends testify to the peaceable fruits of righteousness that
are to be found amongst the converts, and to the social
improvement and industry that abounds wherever the
principles of the Reformation have spread."</p>
 <p> A  statement inserted in the "Times" newspaper for
March 17, <date value="1853">1853</date>, gives the following particulars:-
  " The work of the Society is carried on in 23 Missions,





<pb id="p.280" n="280"/>

which extend into 22 counties. There are besides, 39 Local
Committees for Missions, composed of parochial clergy,
assisted by the Society, and established in 25 counties in
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.</p>
  <p>" The Society is now allied with the Irish Society (<placeName key="Dublin">Dublin</placeName>),
which latter is to confine its instructions to the province of
<placeName key="Munster">Munster</placeName>, into which the operations of the Irish Church
Missions are not to extend.</p>
   <p>" <persName key="The Bishop of Tuam">The Bishop of Tuam</persName> has confirmed 1,948 converts from
Romanism since  <date value="1849-10">October,1849</date>. Eight new churches and
several school-rooms have been erected, and are in progress
of erection by the individual efforts of Christian friends, for
the accommodation of the converts. Over 5,000 children
are taught in Scriptural schools.</p>
 <p> "In <placeName key="Dublin">Dublin</placeName> alone, the agents of the Society made 33,980
visits to Roman Catholic families within the year <date value="1852">1852</date>,
whilst large numbers of Romanists attend the controversial
sermons in different churches, and the inquiring classes are
crowded to inconvenience.</p>
  <p>" The Society at present employs 37 missionary clergy-
men, 21 lay agents, 229 Scripture-readers, and 98 school-
masters and mistresses. In all 388 agents, besides some
hundreds of Irish teachers. This number does not include
those employed by 39 Local Committees, whose salaries are
paid by the Society."</p>
  <p>It is stated by the <persName key="Roden,Earl of ">Earl of Roden</persName>, in the small volume
published by him, entitled "The Reformation in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>,"
and written immediately after a personal investigation of the
results on the spot,-</p>
  <p>" The results which have followed these missionary efforts
have fully justified the opinion which I always held,
that nothing could really benefit our wretched country
[<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>] by improving the character of our people, but the
diffusion of Scriptural knowledge amongst them. Surely the




                <pb id="p.281" n="281"/>

success of this work is a cause for gratitude and praise to
God, to whom alone the glory is due. A total change takes
place, not only in the appearance of the people, but in their
habits and conduct; even those most opposed to the Missions
are obliged to confess that no Jumpers (as the converts are
called) have been convicted by the magistrates at sessions
for theft or other crimes; some may have been maliciously
accused, but I am told no instance of conviction has taken
place. There are various Societies engaged in this great
work, each occupying different localities, none interfering
one with the other. The object is so great, and the work so
extensive, that all these Societies are most useful. The
schools that we have visited in <placeName key="Connemara">Connemara</placeName> and <placeName key="West Gal-
way">West Gal-

and <placeName key="Ventry">Ventry</placeName>, in <placeName key="Kerry">Kerry</placeName>, are under a separate Mission of their own.
. . . I must not omit to mention our Presbyterian brethren,
who have also a Mission in the West, where they are not less
zealous and active, under the <persName key="Edgar, Rev. Dr.">Rev. Dr. Edgar</persName>, of <placeName key="Belfast">Belfast</placeName>.
We had not time to visit them  .... I would say to any one
who may doubt these details, Decide not till you have seen
the work yourselves. It is very easy of access, . . . and the
scenery itself would well repay the trouble and fatigue of the
journey.... Sure I am that the <title>Bible</title> is the great remedy
for the ills of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, the knowledge of which the people
themselves value above all other knowledge, and . . . they
are thirsting for it, and anxious to be acquainted with its
contents." <note place="foot" n="1">Pp. 84-87</note>.</p>
  <p>In another part of the book, <persName key="Lord Roden">Lord Roden</persName> states:-" The
<persName key="Bishop of Tuam">Bishop of Tuam</persName> told me to-day ( <date value="1851-09-04">September 4,1851</date>), that

the children, had left the <orgName key="Church of Rome">Church of Rome"</orgName> within his diocese.
Hitherto I have had little to tell you of violent persecution,
the extent of conversion in the district through which we
have passed having nearly overcome it." <note place="foot" n="2">P. 33</note></p>
 <p> His Lordship, in another part, thus describes a confirma-
tion he happened to witness-one only of a series held
throughout the country:--" A missionary arrived with a
number of converts, who had left their locality, 20 miles
distant, at 12 o'clock the night before, and had traversed the
mountains all night, in order to be present at the confirma-
tion. We met them in the morning, greatly fatigued ....
The morning service was read, and 99 persons, the great
majority of them being adults, were waiting in the aisle of
the church, and in the pews, for confirmation. The Bishop
preached an excellent sermon, warning the converts of all
they might have to endure, and pointing them to the true
source of strength and power, which was to be found only by
looking unto Jesus. He received the converts by 12 at a
time, and laid his hands upon them, pronouncing the usual

  <quote rend="blockquote"> The innumerable conversions which, from  their com-
mencement in the little island of <placeName key="Achil">Achil</placeName>, in <date value="1835">1835</date>, to the
present day, have been effected in the West of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, from

counties of <placeName key="Donegal">Donegal</placeName>, <placeName key="Cork">Cork</placeName>, <placeName key="Kerry,">Kerry,</placeName> and even in <placeName key="Dublin">Dublin</placeName>, have
been most extensive and extraordinary. For instance, in
the town of <placeName key="Westport">Westport</placeName>, there are now 3 Protestant churches,
and 5 more in the parish. ... At <placeName key="Clifden">Clifden</placeName> the conversion
burst out so rapidly, that already by far the greater propor-
tion of the inhabitants are Protestants. . . . The sisters of
mercy zealously combine with the priests to stop the move-
ment, and their efforts are extraordinary. In short, every
engine is brought to bear against this alarming conversion;
a regularly organized denunciation is levelled against all
aiders and abettors of the Protestant missionaries, as well
as against any one who affords them any countenance what-
ever. Any Roman Catholic who listens to a Protestant
clergyman, or to a Scripture-reader, is denounced as a
marked man, and people are forbidden to have any dealings
with him in trade or business, to sell him food, or buy it
of him.   For instance, a shoemaker at Westport lately
seceded from the Catholic Church; the sisters immediately
offered him 21. a-week, which he refused. Not a journey-
man dared work for him. A priest went round to every
man that dealt with him, until only one person would sell
him leather.</quote> <note place="foot" n="5"><title>" Fortnight in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>,"</title> pp. 154-5.</note>t</p>

remarkable of late years. Nor ought we to look too much
to second causes. But it has been ordinarily supposed that
they have, in the wonderful order of God's providence,
resulted from the famine. The immense sums of money so
freely and generously raised in England at that time did
much apparently to open the Irish heart. Mr. O'Connell and
his party had previously persuaded the Irish that the Saxons
hated them, would do nothing for their help under any cir-
cumstances, and almost desired their blood.  The priests
also had generally confirmed the truth of these assertions.
The common people were simple enough to believe them.
But when it was found that in almost every parish in
England a larger collection on their behalf was made than
had been known to be obtained for any other object, and
that there was manifestly a general zeal shown here to save
them from starvation, they saw that the demagogues and the
priests in whom they had trusted had deceived them, and
that the English, in spite of difference of creed, were truly
their friends.</p>

Report of the parent Society, he proceeds-" Not a single
clergyman is on the Committee, or holds any office in the

convert the heathen-men uneducated, unspiritual, unquali-

now such men are deemed fully qualified if they have only a
sufficient supply of Bibles to distribute, in some ludicrous
translation, and have themselves learned sufficient of <title>Bible</title>
phraseology to perfect them in cant. And at home likewise
we now see the episcopal office usurped by committees of

  The very appearance of such a warning from a quarter so
high, would intimate that in the judgment of those to whom
it is given, such efforts are producing effect. Nor is it
lay agency to which Rome objects. The very High Church
party of the <orgName key="Church of England">Church of England</orgName> have alone that scruple.
Rome is far too wise in the wisdom of this world to discard
lay agency in imparting religious instruction. When it has
answered her own purposes she has always extensively
employed it, as all history will testify. But that which
Rome trembles at is the Word of God, whether written
in the book or spoken by the lips, and be these lips laical or
be they ecclesiastical, it matters not to her.

 <p> Very numerous as are the Irish in London, they have
not succeeded in bringing over to their religion any portion
of our own working population. This alone is encouraging,
considering their zeal and our own negligence and indiffer-
ence.  The following quotation on this subject is taken
from the " <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName> Magazine," of November,
<date value="1851">1851</date>:-</p>
   <p>" The general testimony of our missionaries is, that
although from the influx of Irish there has been a great
accession to the number of Roman Catholics, there has been
no accession at all among the poor from a change of senti-
ments having been effected. The triumph of Popery in
London of late, great as it has been, has been almost exclu-
sively among the educated and higher orders of society,
And it has been particularly ineffectual in its effects, God
be praised, among the poor. We do not think 50 perverts
could be found on our 250 districts, comprising, as these do,
probably 500,000 individuals. The following extracts from
the Reports of missionaries will confirm this, and will be




                 <pb id="p.287" n="287"/>

read probably with some surprise, but, we feel assured, with
a great thankfulness to God:-</p>
  <p>"(1.)' Since I have been on this district (1 3/4 year), I
have not known one case where a nominal Protestant has
become a pervert to Popery. But during that time 2 Roman
Catholics have left the Romish Church.' (2.) I have been
on this Romish district nearly 13 years, and not one instance
of perversion from Protestantism to Popery has taken place
on it during that period.' (3.) ' One of the most wealthy
Romish congregations is on my district, and great exertions
have been made by those connected with it to proselyte.
But I can only number 51 Roman Catholic families, and
I do not know of more than 4 or 5 during the 5 years
I have been here, who have joined their ranks, and these
were rather through the treachery of the clergymen of two
Protestant churches.  One of these clergymen has since
himself joined the <orgName key="Church of Rome">Church of Rome"</orgName>, and the other has been
silenced by the Bishop of London.' (4.) ' Of the 202 Roman
Catholic families on my district, I am not aware of a case
where a proselyte has been made to Popery of late, although
there are 3 females who became perverts years ago.'
(5.) 'During the 5 years I have been on this district, I know
of no one proselyte to the <orgName key="Church of Rome">Church of Rome"</orgName> among the poor,
which is the more remarkable, as 2 clergymen of the Church
of England who officiated on the district were seduced.'
(6.) ' During 9 years' labours, I have only met with 1 woman,
with 2 or 3 of her children, who have gone over to Popery,
but I have met with many who have become converts to
Protestantism.' (7.) 'In 4 years, I have only known 1
family converted to Popery, and in that instance the poor
man has been known to be of unsound mind for years, and
has a silver plate in his head. His wife followed him, simply
because she thought she was obliged. The late movements
have made Popery more unpopular than ever with the





<pb id="p.288" n="288"/>

people.' (8.) 'Although the priests are so active on this my
Popish district, the only increase in Roman Catholics is
from importations from <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.' (9.) 'There is neither
a single perversion to Popery on this Popish district, nor
a single Englishman who is a Papist.' (10.) 'With all the
efforts of the nunnery on my district, the sisters of mercy,
and the priests, every Roman Catholic here states that he
was bred and born such.'</p>

<p>Indications of a Reformation among the Irish in London,
  which shall resemble in its Extent and Reality that which
  has recently been effected in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>.
  It may be hoped, however, not only that the Irish will not
bring over the English to the Romish faith, but that the
English will bring over the Irish to the Protestant faith.
There is very much to encourage such a belief.   Mr.
Garratt's sentiments on this subject are our own:-</p>
 <p> " There is no denying that, in spite of every check, the
current of opinion among those who influence society (in
England) is setting Romeward .  .</p>
 <p> "But while on the upper surface of society the tide is
going towards Rome, at the very bottom, among the lowest
class, among the Irish, not only in London, but everywhere,
there is a tide from Rome. These men have no influence.
It would not affect the general religious aspect of the nation,
if, instead of being Roman Catholics or Protestants, they
were heathen or Mahometans. But though they can do
nothing, they may suffer much. They may glorify Christ
by patient endurance of persecution for his name's sake. We
may be training martyrs. It is in this light I look upon the
work among the Irish in London. I trust that, however
dark the days that are coming, God is lighting lamps to





                                  <pb id="p.289" n="289"/>

shine brighter as the night grows blacker. There is much
in the Celtic character to justify this hope. Slow in acting,
they are patient in enduring. When they once have their
minds opened to the truth, they embrace it with a cordiality
and love which seems to say that they will not let it go.
And I think, if we look at the records of the past, we shall
find that, for the most part, God has honoured with the
crown of martyrdom men poor in this world but rich in
faith, like the Celtic Waldenses of Piedmont or the Celtic
Protestants of London. It may be that God will suffer
England once more to fall under the power of the apostasy,
and yet enable some of our despised Irishmen to keep alive
the light of truth in the recesses of our city, and when the
pomp and splendour of this world is given to the beast, to
overcome him through the blood of the Lamb, and not to
love their lives unto the death."</p>
 <p> A further quotation from  the <title>"London City Mission
Magazine"</title> last referred to, will illustrate the general open-
ing of the minds of the Irish, to a greater or less extent, to
scriptural instruction :-</p>
  <p>"It is ordinarily the case, that after a time opposition
becomes very strong, through the interference of the priests,
so that missionaries find visitation more and more difficult.
This, however, in its turn ordinarily gradually subsides, by
perseverance, prudence, and kindness.  We add a few
extracts from the Reports of missionaries, who have been a
long period on their districts, in illustration.</p>
  <p>" One missionary writes:-' Of the 79 Romish families on
my district, 10 have received the Scriptures from me, and
many Roman Catholic families who have left have also had
a copy. There are also very few of the remaining families
who will not listen while I read the Scriptures to them.
The priest has been about among the people in general in
the low parts of the district, and asked Protestant families to






<pb id="p.290" n="290"/>

send their children to the Romish school, and to attend
Mass, but I do not know of one instance in which they have
succeeded. The priests, I believe, dare not go among the
Protestants in the other parts of the district.' A second
missionary writes:--' In some cases, the Roman Catholics
refuse the tracts, being told to do so by the priests, and yet,
strange as it may appear, they will allow me to sit down and
read with them the <title>Bible</title>. While I have been thus engaged,
such remarks as the following have fallen from their lips:-
" And sure that's very good." " And that's no lie." I have
met with one case of a member of the <orgName key="Church of England">Church of England</orgName>
inclined to go over to Popery, but, by God's blessing, he
was prevented from so doing by the visits of the Mission.'
A third missionary, who has been very long on his district,
writes:-' I find but little difficulty in gaining access to all
the Roman Catholics, except one, who is an aged widow.'
A fourth missionary, after some length of service, writes:-
'There are ordinarily from 70 to 100 Roman Catholic fami-
lies on my district, but they all open their doors to me, and
willingly and cheerfully receive my visits. The great draw-
back is that they seldom continue more than a few months.'
Another missionary, whose length of service has been less,
and who has also been less successful in gaining access to
Roman Catholics, yet writes:-' Although about one-third
of the Popish families refuse the tracts, on the ground either
of their not being able to read them, or because they are
opposed to their religion and they fear to offend their priests;
and although, sunk in ignorance, depravity, and bitter pre-
judice against all instruction from a Protestant teacher, they
constitute a most difficult and discouraging class for the
missionary to deal with, I yet feel that there is ground of
hope and encouragement. In many cases the tracts are
received; in some cases I have the opportunity of reading
the Word of God; and even in those cases where I fail of



                <pb id="p.291" n="291"/>

success in both these particulars, I am generally able to
leave with them a verbal testimony to the truth as it is in
Jesus.' The statement of another missionary is:-' Of 118
Roman Catholic families on the district, I have free access
to 98, and am accustomed to read the Scriptures and con-
verse with them.'</p>
  <p>" Even on a district where, with 17 exceptions, the whole
of the families are professedly Roman Catholic, the mis-
sionary is allowed to visit all but two. The workhouses are
another striking illustration of the willingness of the Roman
Catholics in general to receive the instruction of the mis-
sionaries. In almost all the Unions there is a large number
of Papists; but the missionaries find much opportunity of
usefulness among them.  Where the number of Roman
Catholics on a district is small, there is probably even more
readiness to receive instruction. The following extract will
give an illustration:-</p>
 <p> "' I have only 9 Roman Catholic families on my district.
To 4 of these I have supplied the Scriptures. 1. To Mr.
  - , a journeyman tailor, who has 5 young Irishmen work-
ing with him. When I first called, they all refused to listen
to me, saying they were not of the same religion. After
several visits and much opposition, they, however, accepted
a <title>Bible</title>, and now the master reads it aloud, and the men
offer their remarks on it; so that in this house a Bible class
may be said to be held daily. When I call, they ask me to
explain the difficulties which have occurred. 2. To Mr.
- - , whose mother died in a nunnery. His grandmother
was also in a nunnery, and used to make the wafers. He
was brought up in a Romish school. I lent him a loan copy
of the Scriptures, which he has been induced to read for
himself. He has now nearly read it through. He has been
once to <placeName key="St. Martin's Church">St. Martin's Church</placeName>, and expresses himself as edified
by what he heard. 3. To Mr.    -, a journeyman shoe-






<pb id="p.292" n="292"/>
maker, who, when I first visited him, called me a soul-
destroyer, and spoke many bitter things against me and all
Protestants. He has accepted a loan <title>Bible</title>, and appears
anxious to understand it. 4. To Mr. -, also a journey-
man shoemaker. He worked with others who professed to
be Deists. He has received a loan <title>Bible</title>, which is read to
them all.'</p>
  <p>"In such cases as the following, the useful working of the
Mission is also apparent:-The parties connected with the
parish church have lately sold the National School-room of
the parish to the Romanists. These latter, by a great effort,
had nearly 300 children for some time, but they now do not
average 100. I attribute this decrease mainly to missionary
exertions." <note place="foot" n="1"> Since this extract was written by the missionary, the average
 attendance at the school has further declined to about 30.
</note></p>
  <p>What is being effected among the Irish of London may
be illustrated by a reference to a single church, that of <placeName key="St.
Paul's Bermondsey,">St.
Paul's Bermondsey,</placeName>, in which a great work has been for some
time going on. In little more than a year about 340 adults
have renounced Popery there! At first, this was done pub-
licly in the church, but it exposed the converts to so much
opposition that the renunciation has been of late made in
the house of the Incumbent. Most of these have since
become communicants in the Protestant Church, and it is
believed that they have been generally impressed with the
spiritual power of the truths which they have received. It
has not been with them a mere change of creed, but also a
change of habit and life. So much has this been the case,
that converts may be distinguished from others by their very
dress, which has become so much more respectable; and by
even their countenances, which appear changed and lit up
with animation, through the freedom   which they have
received. Fully 20 of them have been engaged in seeking





                               <pb id="p.293" n=" 293"/>

to convert their fellow-countrymen, as Scripture-readers, in
different parts of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> and in English towns. The chil-
dren also of these converts are brought under Protestant
instruction. Five only of the converts have gone back,
although most strenuous efforts have been made for that
purpose. The woman to whom the priest used such violence,
as referred to in a former page, was one of these converts,
as her husband had been before. And so great was the
disposition manifested to interfere with her at that time, that
the missionary felt it necessary to secrete her between the
trials in his own house; while a neighbouring missionary,
also much implicated in the occurrence, by the advice of the
clergy around, felt it a needful precaution, for the purpose of
intimidation, to furnish his house with loaded pistols.
</p>
</div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="The Persecution which the recent London Converts have had to endure" id="c5s29"><head>The Persecution which the recent London Converts have had
                        to endure.</head>
  <p>So great has been the opposition, that even natural affec-
tion, and that among a class in whom it is so peculiarly
strong, has given way to the bigotry of creed. The dearest
relatives have cast from them, as objects of hatred, those
whom before they most loved. One woman recently said to
a missionary, around this church, " I have one young child,
and if that child were but to turn Protestant, I solemnly vow,
that I would sacrifice him to God," at the same time taking
up a large pair of scissars to show, by action as well as
word, how ready she would be, for the sake of her religion,
to plunge the scissars into the flesh of her own offspring.
  The priest referred to was specially sent to the locality
from <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, by the authorities of the Romish Church, to
counteract the success of the work of conversion which was
going on. His knowledge of the Irish language, it was con-
sidered, would give him an advantage, where God's Word
had begun to be preached in Irish, and where Irish-speaking





<pb id="p.294" n="294"/>
missionaries were diligently at work. On his arrival, he
sent agents about Bermondsey to find out the residences of
those who had professed themselves converts, or who admitted
Bible-readers into their houses. He then denounced their
names from the altar, and desired the congregation to employ
all means to bring them back to the true fold, from which
they had strayed, adding, that if they did not succeed, he
should employ the authority given him by the Church to
curse them. It was, however, quite enough for the priest to
denounce the names of these persons, to induce the congre-
gation to use them ill, and, while doing so, they doubtless
considered that they were doing God service. The work of
persecution forthwith began. Many were knocked down in
the public streets, others were beaten and their lives threat-
ened, others were struck with brickbats on their heads. It
was with the design of putting a stop to such proceedings
that a warrant was applied for against the priest, that it
might be shown how English law would not permit such
atrocities, but that all in this free country may worship God
according to the dictates of their own conscience. And the
result of the trial led to his departure from the neighbour-
hood, while one woman in the Court, at the trial, was so
favourably impressed towards Protestantism, especially by
hearing the Protestant clergyman request mercy for the
priest from the magistrate, that it ended in her renouncing
Popery and embracing the pure faith of the <title>Bible</title>. She has
ever since herself been most zealous in making converts to
Protestantism.</p>
 <p> The efforts of the missionaries of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName>
have had their share in the success, as will appear from the
following extracts from the monthly schedules forwarded to
that Society, by the <persName key="Armstrong, Rev. Dr.">Rev. Dr. Armstrong</persName>, Incumbent of
<placeName key="St. Paul's">St. Paul's</placeName>:-</p>
  <p><date value="1852-07">"July, 1852</date>.-The work of one of the missionaries has

led this month to 12 persons renouncing Popery. I am
sorry to say, the persecution has become so hot that he is
prevented from visiting some places where he was formerly
welcome, but this, I trust, will only be a temporary hin-
derance. The priests are very violent in their proceedings.
The second missionary has been very active and zealous
among the Romanists. Two adults will, I expect, soon
renounce Popery, and 6 children have this month been
induced to attend school.</p>
<p>  "August.-Since the last return, several have given in
their names as converts from Popery.</p>
  <p>" September.-The missionaries' work is progressing well.
Three persons have lately declared themselves Protestants,
as the result of their work; but I expect many more very
soon, as there is now a great spirit of inquiry.</p>
  <p>" October.-A capital month. One missionary has brought
in 14 converts. He is obliged to be very much with me,
helping in the reception of inquirers, which will account for
his not having visited more families. One very good convert
has been brought in this month by the second missionary.
He has many very hopeful cases on his hand, but it must be
remembered that his ground is not so advantageous, though
most important, as it has not been so much broken up.</p>
   <p>"November.--Since the prosecution of the priest there
has been a great opposition to the entrance of the mission-
aries, but I trust this will be only temporary. The con-
vincing of the poor people that the priests are not invulner-
able will, it is hoped, make a good impression. Indeed,

of quitting Popery.</p>
  <p> " December.-During the month 8 persons have, by the

   <p>To show the difficulties with which some of these converts





<pb id="p.296" n="296"/>
have had to strive in the step they have, by God's grace,
taken, a few details are given from the last Report of
one of the Bermondsey missionaries of the <orgName key="London City
Mission ">London City
Mission </orgName>:-</p>
 <p> " On - -, while he was at work on a wharf, a cask was
let fall. It just missed him, and he escaped unhurt. The
Romanist who let it fall laughed, and coolly said, 'A good
job, if it had killed him.' The poor man has been since
frequently pelted with stones, and hurt; but he bears all with
Christian fortitude, and says they could do nothing which
would more tend to convince him of the errors of Popery.
  "- - was knocked down, while standing in front of his
own yard; his head came on the curb-stone, and his life
was in great danger. The people immediately ran for the
priest, who was soon in attendance, but he told him that he
was a convert, and wished to see <persName key="Arsmtrong, Rev. Dr.">Dr. Armstrong</persName>, the Pro-
testant clergyman. The latter at once went, but was quickly
surrounded by a crowd of persons, who prevented him from
speaking to the injured man. One took hold of a stool and
was about to strike the clergyman, but was prevented by
another to whom the clergyman was known. I then made
an effort to speak to the man, but to no purpose. About 15
women gathered round, and when he tried to answer any
question I put to him, they put their hands on his mouth to
stop him. He soon became quite unconscious from the
effects of the blow he had received.</p>
  <p>" The priest, some time since, offered the converts, that if
any of them would return to the true fold, he would pay their
passage to <placeName key="America">America</placeName>. There were only 6 who accepted his
offer. These he employed for some time in trying to bring
others with them, but they were unsuccessful. On their
asking him at length, when they were to be sent off, he told
them that they must look out for work in London, and
excused himself from sending them to <placeName key="America">America</placeName>. They




                <pb id="p.297" n="297"/>

therefore left him again in disgust, doubly convinced that
Popery is a monstrous delusion. They have ever since
attended regularly Protestant worship, and they often warn
the other converts not to be led away by false promises, but
to hold fast the religion of the Gospel. They have thus
become strengthened in the faith."</p>

soon become a Protestant, and England a Popish Country.</head>
  <p>As in the early ages of the Christian Church, opposition
has only tended to the increase of converts. At the same
time, the success in London, or in England generally, has
been by no means what it has been in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> itself of late,
and especially in the western parts of that island. The
events of the last year at <placeName key="Bermondsey">Bermondsey</placeName> would lead, however,
to the hope, that with increased effort they would more
nearly resemble each other. It has been so extensive of late
in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, that visitation among the Romish Irish, even
in London, will show, they entertain themselves now the
expectation, that ere long <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> will become a Pro-
testant country. This is their own general belief. Nineteen
years ago (in <date value="1834">1834</date>) a return was made by the Commis-
sioners of Public Instruction, from which it appeared that
there were then in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> 6,431,008 Roman Catholics,
852,676 members of the Established Church, 642,356
Presbyterians, 21,808 other Protestant Dissenters, and
6,254 whose religion could not be ascertained.  By this
return there were 4 1/4 Roman Catholics to every Protestant.
It is believed by those best informed, that at the present
time the respective numbers are very nearly equal, while
Protestantism has on its side the vast ascendancy in the
wealth and influence of the country. It is, however, a most
affecting fact to append to this, that the expectations of the
Irish of London are not less general, that <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> will





<pb id="p.298" n="298"/>
ere long become a Protestant country, than that England
will become a Popish country. They anticipate the latter
as firmly as the former.</p>
  <p>With a population in the midst of our metropolis undis-
guisedly and avowedly Romish in its creed, and numbering
200,000 souls, what efforts ought not to be made by Protes-
tants on their behalf! They require to a great extent a
distinct agency, peculiarly adapted to themselves. Persons
who understand the Irish character, the Irish controversy,
and even the Irish language, are the parties needed, as well
as men who can endure a large amount of very rough work.
And less than one hundred such men are insufficient for this
one class, even to give each separate family a single visit
each month. It ought also to be known by Christians, that
Irish Romanists are themselves very zealous to make converts
of English Protestants. They are urged to do this from the
pulpits of Romish chapels. "If," said <persName key="Cardinal Wiseman ">Cardinal Wiseman </persName>to
a Romish congregation recently, " all of you can but bring
over each one person during the next year, how blessed
would be the result;" and then he urged it strongly on them
to make the trial. They do succeed, moreover, to a consider-
able extent, in alluring English Protestants to attend occa-
sional services at Romish chapels. And who shall say to
what this may lead, with a population themselves very
ignorant and uninstructed ? Indulgences granted for each
convert, we believe extending to a hundred days, present also
a strong motive to effort.

  <p>It might have been supposed that the immigration of
Irish would have ceased to a great extent after the year of
the famine. Such has, however, not been the case in so
marked a manner as might have been anticipated, for in
<date value="1851">1851</date> Irish emigration amounted to 257,372.    And the
reason has been that the potato crop, on which <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>
depends as its staple supply of food, has never since reco-
vered from the injury of that year. It has not yielded since
as it did before. The opposition between the steam-com-
panies' vessels has also been so great since, that steerage
passengers from <placeName key="Cork">Cork</placeName> to London, who now are charged
10s. 6d. for their passage, were a year or two since brought
over for 1s. a-head; and, indeed, at length one company, in
order to obtain more passengers than the other, brought
them over gratis; nor satisfied even with this, they at
length offered the premium of a loaf of bread as a reward
to all who would patronize their boats rather than the boats
of the rival company. At that time the <orgName key="Poor-Law Guardians">Poor-law Guardians</orgName>
in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> were known to have sent over the paupers for the

has consequently ceased.</p>

              and the worst Class to London.</head>
  <p>In the days of <placeName key="Queen Elizabeth">Queen Elizabeth</placeName>, it was customary to
divide the Irish into three classes, " the Irish, the wild
Irish, and the extreme wild Irish."  The first of these




                                 <pb id="p.301" n="301"/>

divisions comprised the respectable and higher classes; the
second, the poor inhabiting the towns and valleys; and the
third, the inhabitants of remote country parts, and more
especially of the bogs and mountains. The same divisions
may be made in the days of Queen Victoria as in the days
of<placeName key="Queen Elizabeth"> Queen Elizabeth</placeName>. And the class of Irish with which we
are most familiar in the courts and alleys of London, are by
no means the most favourable specimens of the nation. We
are the nearest country to which to emigrate from <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>,
and the Irish who have imbibed the common spirit for
emigration, which is now so general there, but who can
afford to emigrate nowhere else, come over to us as the
nearest and the cheapest port. We therefore get the poorest
of the people, almost all of whom come from country parts,
and not from the large towns. It is also to be remembered,
that the favourite country for emigrating to with the Irish
is <placeName key="America">America</placeName>. Very few Irish leave their native land but
with the intention of settling there.  They intend their
resort here to be only a step towards the accomplishment of
that end. They know England, and especially London, to
be a place where wages are high, as compared with what
they can earn at home; and when they hear that Cardinal
Wiseman opened an office for the transaction of business
with the Irish, and with the Roman Catholics in general, on
his arrival in London, in <placeName key="Silver-street">Silver-street</placeName>, <placeName key="Golden-square">Golden-square</placeName>, and
that a large colony of their own poor fellow-countrymen
reside in <placeName key="Golden-lane, Barbican,">Golden-lane, Barbican,</placeName> they believe the very
names denote the wealth which there abounds.   As an
Irishman recently said to a party who visited him, " Well,
I thought I should never here have a day's want. I thought
money was almost to be picked up in the streets." They do
not regard England with any fondness, excepting that they
generally consider the English as honest, although heretics,
who will keep their word, and pay them what they agree for.





<pb id="p.302" n="302"/>

They generally simply desire to come, in order to obtain
money to get over to <placeName key="America">America</placeName>. The greater number succeed
in their object, and gain enough here to carry them over,
living in the interim in a manner, in order to save, which the
English would consider an especial hardship. Some few of
those who came over have already, by the recent efforts in
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, been converted to the Protestant faith. And it is
most encouraging to know what large numbers of them
become Protestants on their arrival in <placeName key="America">America</placeName>, where they
can change their faith without being exposed to those
annoyances and persecutions which invariably accompany
such a step in their own land. Such a circumstance shows,
however, how hopefully we might engage in efforts to
convert them in this country. The following extract is from
the pen of an Irish priest, named Mullen, and was lately
inserted in the newspaper called the " Freeman: "-</p>
  <p>"Is there to be no voice raised, no hope held out, that
will keep the people at home, and thus save millions from
spiritual destruction ? I say millions ! Here are my facts:-</p>
  <p>"The present population of the United States is about
15,000,000, and of these the Catholic Church claims only
1,980,000. From the year <date value="1825">1825</date> to <date value="1844">1844</date>, 1,250,000 left
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, 1,000,000 of whom came to <placeName key="America">America</placeName>; the propor-
tion of Catholics amongst these may be fairly estimated at
800,000. Since that period to the present the numbers who
emigrated here from <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> at the lowest calculation were
1,500,000; and taking the Catholics as above, we will have
in 9 years 1,200,000. A large number (say half a million)
came from Germany, some from <placeName key="Italy">Italy</placeName>, <placeName key="France">France</placeName>, <placeName key="Belgium">Belgium</placeName>, and
other countries, during the last 10 years, half of whom were
Catholics-say 250,000. Twelve years ago <placeName key="America">America</placeName> had a
Catholic population (according to Dr. England,<persName key=" Bishop of
Charleston"> Bishop of

number by births at the very small number of 500,000, and





                                 <pb id="p.303" n="303"/>

adding, for converts in the larger cities and towns, 20,000,
we will have the following total:</p>
<p>Catholic emigrants from the year <date value="1825">1825</date> to <date value="1844">1844</date>.  800,000

  <p>But is it not a reproach to London, that so few of the
Irish who have immigrated here in recent years should have
become Protestants, while millions have done so there?
And is it not a still greater reproach to us, that while Popery
bewails the loss of her sons and daughters to Protestantism
in <placeName key="America">America</placeName>, it adds its lamentation on their loss, when they
immigrate here, to "the moral turpitude of England [which]

 <p> Of the Irish immigrants who remain in London, few have
any such intention at first.  But they gradually become
accustomed to the place and its habits, and at length settle
down in it. Their descendants are called "Irish Cockneys,"
and the new-comers are called " Grecians." By these names
they are generally distinguished among themselves. And





<pb id="p.304" n="304"/>

the two divisions of this class are most distinct.  The
animosity which subsists between them is very bitter, far
beyond that which often unhappily subsists between the
Irish and the English. The Cockneys regard the Grecians
as coming to take the bread out of their own mouths, and
consider their extensive immigration as tending to lower their
own wages. Having also succeeded in raising themselves,
at least some steps, from that abject poverty and nakedness
which distinguished them on their first arrival, they now
look on the Grecians as bringing a discredit on their country
by their appearance and necessities.  There are constant
quarrels between the two, and they are so estranged that
they will not live even in the same parts of the town, after
the first flow of generous hospitality has passed over.</p>

  <p>The same bitter feeling exists among the Grecians them-

The great mass of Irish in London are from <placeName key="Munster">Munster</placeName>, and
especially from the large counties of <placeName key="Cork">Cork</placeName> and <placeName key="Kerry">Kerry</placeName>, the
most populous parts of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>. But there are probably a

mixture. <placeName key="Golden-lane">Golden-lane</placeName> is the chief Connaught colony. The
old contentions between the different petty kingdoms of
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> are not yet wholly calmed, and the bringing together
of Irish from different provinces into one city does not
exhibit them to advantage.

own country is, that in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> there is that regard to virtue
in females that no man will marry them after they have
once transgressed. Their prospect of marriage afterwards is
entirely hopeless there. Nor would an illegitimate child in

ration before that, give a female much chance. It is, there-
fore, a common practice for young women who have fallen
from virtue to emigrate here, as their only hope, the state
of morals here among the poor being far lower than there.

             and Irish respectively estimated.</head>
 <p> It is a common mistake to suppose that the Irish in
London cannot read. This is by no means the case. Since
the Government schools have been established, and the
efforts of religious Societies have been enlarged, education in
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> has become much more general, especially among
the Roman Catholics; and the priests, who before opposed
schools, have been brought to give their patronage to schools
of a certain order, in which the scholars are, at all events,
taught to read.  The extent to which this is operating,
even in the more Popish parts, is evident from the mere
statement that these Government schools of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> were
alone, in <date value="1850">1850</date>, 4,548, which (as the number of parishes
in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> is only 2,422), is nearly two schools to every
parish, besides 124 workhouse schools. The Government
schools, moreover, increase annually, although the population
decreases. During that year they had increased 133, and
the number of children had increased 30,616, making more
than a million of children who were under instruction, by
far the larger proportion of whom are Roman Catholic.
Indeed, at the Training Establishment in <placeName key="Dublin">Dublin</placeName>, of 272
teachers who were that year being trained as school-masters
and mistresses, 214 were Papists. And all this, it is to be






<pb id="p.306" n="306"/>

remembered, is additional to a great variety of other educa-
tional efforts, some of which are on a large scale.  The
consequence is, that there are very few of the Irish emigrants
under 20 years of age who cannot read English, and of those
above 20, the male population can now also very generally
read. The reading of Irish is a higher advance in know-
ledge. Probably not more than a fourth of those who can
read English can read Irish, although Irish is the language
which this class ordinarily speak among themselves, and
which they know much better than English. The Irish
language is one of a somewhat learned character, and is
decidedly more difficult than the English. This in itself
clearly shows that the nation speaking it could not have
been originally of an illiterate order. The peculiarity in
Irish of spelling the words so differently to their pronuncia-
tion, and of altering the accents and inflexions in the
different dialects of the different provinces, without altering
the written word, adds to the difficulty of reading Irish
in the Irish character. Fully as large a proportion, however,
of the Irish of London, especially under 20 years of age,
can read English, as of the English poor,-probably a larger
proportion. For the purpose of avoiding the taking of
Protestant tracts, the Irish will, however, feign that they
cannot read them.

The circumstances of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> obliging examination into the

occasioned this, together with the much greater prevalence

it has often been a matter of surprise to the author to observe
how very much better ordinarily is the Irishman's knowledge

  <p>But the Irish professing the Romish faith are almost
entirely without scriptural knowledge. It is estimated by
the Irish missionaries of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName> that
scarcely more than 1 in 50 of the Irish immigrants when they
arrive here, have ever even seen a <title>Bible</title>, or heard a page

to come from the parts of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> in which the recent
Reformation has taken place, or except they can read the
Irish character. Nor is even this the worst. They come
here not only without a knowledge of, but with a most fear-
ful prejudice against the <title>Bible</title>. Their religious ignorance
is most pitiable indeed. One woman stated lately that
she always thought the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary
were the same. Another woman was heard to be actually
cursing God for taking away her son. They will often
speak of the Virgin's dreams as important to their
future spiritual welfare.  A  woman recently affirmed,
that she dreaded the curse of the priest far more than that
of God Almighty. A man also stated, with all gravity, as
what he knew, that the consecrated wafer was once im-
piously cut, and the whole house was at once deluged with
blood. Another man stated, and evidently believed what he
stated, that a letter was received by the Pope every Saturday






<pb id="p.308" n="308"/>

from our Lord <persName key="Christ, Jesus">Jesus Christ</persName>. And another man stated that
the present Pope was a cousin of <persName key="Christ, Jesus">Jesus Christ</persName>'s. These
illustrations, which might easily be multiplied, will show
how gross is their ignorance of the Scriptures, and what a
reproach it is to us to allow them to remain at our doors
uninformed, till perhaps they leave Europe altogether, with
no more religious knowledge than when they first approached
our shores.</p>

                    Religious Habits.</head>
  <p>The Irish immigrants have been generally accustomed,
while in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, to attend mass regularly, and to go to con-
fession twice a-year. When they reach London, many of
them continue this habit for a time, but they gradually
become more and more remiss, and ordinarily, not being
much looked after, they soon almost wholly discontinue
attention to religious duties.  Even for marriages and
burials, although the former is held a sacrament, they
resort, in the vast majority of cases, to Protestant churches,
finding this to be legally of equal validity, disregarding
the religious part of the ceremonies, and concerning them-
selves simply with the secular part of the matter.  An
important attraction also is that it is generally cheaper to
them to resort for such necessary purposes to the Protestant
church than to the Romish chapel. For, miserably poor as
are the Irish here, and even still more poor as they are in
<placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, they yet, even there, are ordinarily charged by their
priests the perfectly exorbitant sum, to persons in their
station, of from 20s. to 25s. for marriage, in addition to the
voluntary offerings which are expected from all the friends
who attend the wedding, among whom a plate is passed
round during the ceremony, into which all are accustomed
to drop something. Nor can any circumstance more clearly






                                  <pb id="p.309" n="309"/>

illustrate the unconcern of the Romish Church in the Irish
poor, than the almost entire absence of effort on its part to
prevent their resort to "stray folds" for such purposes,
although, in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, the priests are accustomed constantly
to impress on their flocks that parties thus married are not
married at all.   There is, to the best of our know-
ledge, scarcely a Romish burial-ground, accessible to the
poor, in all London, for the 200,000 Irish pertaining to her
communion. The visitation for religious purposes among
these classes by the Romish Church is, as with the Pro-
testant Church, chiefly lay. Sisters of mercy and persons
of that description are much more frequently met with than
priests, and the visits of the latter are very seldom from
house to house, except for some special purpose, such as
collecting money. And yet Romish priests in London are
numerous. They are probably about 150. In the "Catholic
Directory" for <date value="1853">1853</date>, in the so-called dioceses of <placeName key="Westminster">Westminster</placeName>
and <placeName key="Southwark">Southwark</placeName>, there are stated to be-priests, 187; churches

  without Loss of Character, they may live in the Neglect
  of all Religious Observances.</head>
 <p> Others of the Irish immigrants regard London as an
Infidel city, in which they may do what they please without
reproach or damage to their character, and immediately on
their arrival they throw off all restraint, and at once disregard
their chapel and all the requirements of their religion. They
even without scruple eat meat on Fridays, the same as on
other days. Both these, and those before mentioned, in a
short period have ordinarily arrived at the same point of
all but Infidelity, and by the time they have become Irish
Cockneys, no term is too bad to describe their character and
habits. They run into every evil, become inmates of our
gaols, and constitute a considerable part of our criminal
population. These Cockneys are probably about a third of
the Irish of London, and the Grecians constitute the remain-
ing two-thirds. It is painful to reflect on what these two-
thirds will almost inevitably become, at least those of them
who remain in London, unless they are arrested in their
downward course by religious instruction. Mr. Mayhew's
remark on the comparative badness of Irish and English,
when Irish have been here long enough, is correct. " I may
here observe-in reference to the statement that Irish parents
will not expose their daughters to the risk of what they
consider corrupt influences-that when a young Irishwoman




          <pb id="p.313" n="313"/>

does break through the pale of chastity, she often becomes,
as I was assured, one of the most violent and depraved of,
perhaps, the most depraved class." <note place="foot" n="1"><title>" London Labour and the London Poor,"</title> vol. i., p. 109.</note></p>

</div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="The Prevalence of Drunkness among the Irish and English compared" id="c5s41"><head>The Prevalence of Drunkenness among the Irish and
                    English compared.</head>
  <p>Drunkenness is a sin to which the Irish, and especially
this portion of the Irish, are much addicted. Not that as a
whole the Irish in their own country are materially worse in
this respect than the English, to our shame be it written.
Although the very cheap price at which spirits may be
obtained in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> presents a special temptation beyond
what exists here, it yet does not appear from the statistical
returns of spirits consumed as compared with the respective
populations, that there is a very material difference. The
Irish consume rather the more per head. But with them
here, as in their own land, the practice differs from that of
the English in this respect. The English who are addicted
to drink ordinarily do so more or less habitually, if not day
by day, at least as often as the weekly wages come in. But
the Irish reserve themselves for special festivals, and special
occurrences, when they indulge in intoxication to a most
fearful extent, outraging all bounds of order and propriety,
and sinking themselves into brutes instead of men.   In
London, the Irish on the whole are greater drunkards than
even the English.  Father Mathew's efforts have effected
much good, but they are an entire exception to the apparent
general unconcern of the priests here to check so very
serious an evil.</p>

<placeName key="Camberwell">Camberwell</placeName>, and <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName>. In fact, wherever in London
what has expressively been called a " Rookery " exists, we
may be assured that it is inhabited by Irish. Where such a
statement as the following can be made, "I have 12 families
who live in a single room, and 10 families in another room; in
general, a single room contains from 3 to 7 families,"<note place="foot" n="1"><title>"London City Mission Magazine,"</title> <date value="1851-11">November, 1851</date>.</note> it may
be with certainty concluded, that district is an Irish rookery.
Our English poor will not live in that manner. The poverty,
the quarrelling, the drunken disturbances, the dirt, and the
excessive crowding together of the Irish, wherever they form
a London colony, cause that they lower the character of every
neighbourhood in which they settle, and landlords are often
glad at length to refuse them as tenants, and to sweep them
away. To a very great extent they remain distinct from the
English, and but few intermarriages between the nations
among the poor occur. While this may be a cause for thank-
fulness, so far as the English poor are concerned, it is at the
same time a very great preventive of the benefit to the Irish,
which they could scarcely fail of receiving from intimate
association with the people of a Protestant nation. And it
tends to make it the more important that they should receive
the visits of Protestant missionaries and Scripture-readers.
The separate congregating together of the Irish in London
renders them also more easy to be reached in that manner.</p>

        </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="The Occupations of the Irish of London" id="c5s43"><head> The Occupations of the Irish of London.</head>
  <p>The occupations of the Irish in London are various. For
many years, the practice was for the Irish to come over to
England to help in the harvest during the autumn, and then
to return. But of late they have remained here. Mr.
Mayhew reckons that 10,000 of the Irish in London are
employed as costermongers. Almost all bricklayers' labourers
are Irish. It is a matter of difficulty to get any Englishman
to carry a hod. A large number of the Irish are employed
in the docks. Very many also are employed by the water-
side. In many of the classes connected with the lading and
unlading of shipping, they constitute the largest portion.
And great numbers leave London during the hay season, the
hop season, or the harvest, and return when these are ended,
to earn a miserable livelihood by any odd jobs which they
can manage to obtain.

  with which they may be obtained" id="c5s44"><head>Especial Suitableness of Irish Scripture-readers and Missionaries for Irish Districts and the more Especial Facilities
  with which they may be obtained.</head>
  <p>The greatest difficulty in imparting religious instruction
efficiently to the working classes of London is in the obtain-
ing of a sufficient number of properly-qualified readers and missionaries.  These are more easy to obtain than they were a few years since.  But the demand for them has
increased in the same proportion. For imparting religious instruction to the Irish  of London, Irish readers and missionaries are best adapted and most suitable, especially if they can speak the Irish language. Now it so happens that <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> furnishes a large supply of valuable labourers, and the wants of London as to the Irish can therefore be more easily met than those of other classes. It might have been supposed that <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> would have furnished more
<pb id="p.316" n="316"/>
religious labourers for such a work than <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>. But such is far from being the case. <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName> has hitherto furnished very few, and <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> very many, while those which Scotland does furnish, with very bright exceptions here and there, are not so generally acceptable to our poor. Nor can the circumstance be altogether lost sight of, that, with whatever freedom from party or sectarian teaching, a lay agent may labour, in this country there is a very large portion of its wealth in the hands of those who are scarcely at present prepared to support any other agency than that of the Established Church, and who when they resolve on aiding a mixed Society, such as that of the <orgName key="London City Mission">London City Mission</orgName>, yet stipulate that the missionary supported by them shall be a Churchman. Now Irishmen from those parts of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> where emigration takes place, are almost all Churchmen. The exceptions are very few. And thus any feeling of
preference or prejudice may without difficulty be met in the
case of the Irish of London, while it is frequently difficult to
comply with it, without sacrifice of objects far more important, as to other classes. The Irish of London are also
undoubtedly less prejudiced against receiving Protestant
visits than they were only 2 or 3 years since.</p>

                    </div2><div2 type="subchapter" n="Future Hopes" id="c5s45"><head>  Future Hopes.</head>
  <p> Let us look forward to the last great day. "All the
outward tinsel which distinguishes man from man will then
have vanished, and the only distinction be that which is real
and inward and unchangeable.   That will still remain.
What if then, among the company of the saved, we should
see a band gathered from the Irish in London? No longer
clothed in rags-for they shall be arrayed in the spotless
garment of the Redeemer's righteousness, having washed
their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
No more to live in the dark back-room on which the day

despised and trampled on,-but the peers of angels, and
kings and priests unto God. 'They shall hunger no more,
neither thirst any more,' and instead of the dark alleys in
which they now live, where nothing meets the eye but
blackened walls and smoky chimneys-they shall gaze with
rapture on the golden streets of the New Jerusalem, and
drink of its living fountains. And when from the whole of
that vast multitude which encircles the throne, there ascends
one united song of praise and thanksgiving, and men of
every nation and people and tongue are sweeping their
golden harps-those who in this London have never had the

      The following are selected from the Notices of the Press:      <quote rend="blockquote">"'Allerton and Dreux' is a story of domestic life, which
    has not a little surprised us by the ability manifested, alike in
    the conception and in the delineation of character.  The
    author possesses also a considerable fund of humour, which
    flows from him without an effort, as if it was the natural train
    into which his thoughts fall."</quote>--Critic.

      "This very beautiful and interesting memoir describes the
    life and opinions of a pious German layman, whose long and
    virtuous career of usefulness came to a close at the beginning
    of the present century. The religious character of his mind
    appears to have been derived from the Pietistic movement.
    We have been charmed with the perusal of this most interesting description of a phase of spiritual life, and commend this
    volume to our readers' attention."-English Review.
