  <p>THE beauty and salubrity of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>,
its combination (so to speak) of the elegancies
of town and country, and the multitude of
its associations with courts, wits, and literature,
have long rendered it such a favourite
with the lovers of books, that the want




<pb id="p.2" n="2"/>

of some account of it, not altogether alien
to its character, has constantly surprised
them.
 </p><p>  The place is not only free from everything
repulsive to the consideration (unless it be
one hidden spot, which the new improvements
will do away), but attention is fairly
invited throughout.  The way to it is the
pleasantest out of town; you may walk in
high-road, or on grass, as you please; the
fresh air salutes you from a healthy soil; and
there is not a step of the way, from its commencement
at <placeName key="Kensington Gore">Kensington Gore</placeName>, to its termination
beyond <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, in which you
are not greeted with the face of some pleasant
memory.
 </p><p> Here, to " minds' eyes" conversant with
local biography, stands a beauty, looking out
of a window; there a wit, talking with other
wits at a garden-gate; there, a poet on the

          <pb id="p.3" n="3"/>

green sward, glad to get out of the London
smoke, and find himself among trees.
 </p><p>  Here come De Veres of the times of
old; Hollands   and  Davenants,  of the
Stuart and Cromwell times; Evelyn peering
about him soberly, and Samuel Pepys
in a bustle.  Here advance Prior, Swift,
Arbuthnot, Gay, <persName key="Newton, Sir Isaac">Sir Isaac Newton</persName>; Steele
from visiting Addison, Walpole from visiting
the Foxes, Johnson from a dinner with
Elphinstone, Junius from a communication
with Wilkes.
 </p><p> Here, in his carriage, is King William the
Third, going from the Palace to open parliament;
Queen Anne, for the same purpose;
George the First, George the Second (we
shall have the pleasure of looking at all these
personages a little more closely); and there,
from out of <placeName key="Kensington Gardens">Kensington Gardens</placeName>, comes
bursting, as if the whole recorded polite


<pb id="p.4" n="4"/>
world were in flower at one and the same
period, all the  fashion  of  the  gayest
times of those sovereigns, blooming with
chintzes, full-blown  with  hoop-petticoats,
towering with top-knots and toupees.
  </p><p> Here comes "Lady Mary," quizzing
everybody, and Lady Suffolk, looking discreet;
there the lovely Bellendens and Lepels;
there Miss Howe, laughing with
Nanty Lowther (who made her very grave
afterwards); there Chesterfield, Hanbury
Williams, Lord Hervey; Miss Chudleigh,
not over-clothed: the Miss Gunnings, drawing
crowds of admirers; and here is
George Selwyn interchanging wit with my
Lady Townshend, the "Lady Bellaston"
(so, at least, it has been said) of " Tom
Jones."
  </p><p>Who is to know of all this company,
and not be willing to meet it ?  To meet



          <pb id="p.5" n="5"/>

it, therefore, we propose, both out of doors
and in-doors, not omitting other persons
who are worth half the rest-Mrs. Inchbald
for one. Mrs. Inchbald shall close the
last generation for us, and Coleridge shall
bring us down to our own time.
 </p><p> Not that we propose to treat the subject
chronologically, except in exhausting one point
at a time. The general chronological point of
view, though good to begin with, in order to
show the rise and growth of a place, would
not suit inspection into particulars. It would
only end in confusing both place and time,
by jumping backwards and forwards from
the same houses for the purpose of meeting
contemporary demands.
 </p><p> The best way of proceeding, after taking
the general survey, is to set out from some
particular spot, on the ordinary principle of
perambulation, and so attend to each house,



<pb id="p.6" n="6"/>
or set of premises by itself, as far as we are
acquainted with it.
  </p><p>Our perambulation, however, must not
be parochial.  <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>h geography is a singular
confounder of all received ideas of
limitation.  Ely Place, Holborn, is in the
county of Cambridge; there are portions of
other shires, which are in other shires; and,
parochially  considered, <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>  is not
only more than <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> in some places,
but it is not <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> itself in others.
In <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> parish, for instance, are
included Earl's Court, Little <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>, Old and
New  Brompton, Kensal Green, and even
some of the houses in Sloane Street; while,
on the other hand, <placeName key="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</placeName> and
<placeName key="Kensington Gardens">Kensington Gardens</placeName> are not in <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, but
in the parish of St. Margaret's Westminster.
 </p><p> Taking leave, therefore, of the wandering
imaginations of parish officers, and confining

       <pb id="p.7" n="7"/>

ourselves to the received idea of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>,
which is the same as that of the Post-office
or Red Book, we shall consider the locality
as circumscribed by Knightsbridge, Earl's
Court, Hammersmith, Notting Hill, and
Bayswater; and since <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> is more
visited from the London side than any other,
with the London side we shall begin.
 </p><p> As to the nature and amount of the
attention we purpose to pay to the respective
objects of our notice, it will be
precisely that which  other observers pay,
who are interested in such things, when
going along aroad.  We shall suppose that
the reader is our companion; that we are
giving him what information we possess in
return for the pleasure of his society; and that
we say neither more nor less on any one of the
objects, than might naturally be said between
friends actually walking together, and equally





<pb id="p.8" n="8"/>

alive to the only real interest of the subject,
that is to say, the human interest; for
gardens themselves, whether at <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> or
at Eden, would be nothing without eyes to
enjoy them; and houses are dry bones, unless
invested with interests of flesh and blood.
 </p><p> But first for the brief survey before
 mentioned, and a word or two respecting the
name of the place.
  </p><p>The meaning of the word <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> is
disputed.  It is commonly derived from  the
Saxon Kyning's-tun, King's-town; though,
as it is written  Chenesitun in Doomsday
Book, and in other old records, it has been
thought traceable to some landed proprietor,
of the name of Chenesi, a family so called
having been found in Somersetshire, in the
reign of Edward the Confessor. Another
ancient authority writes the word,
Chensnetun. Temptations to etymology are great;

           <pb id="p.9" n="9"/>

and as the Chenesi family was probably the
same as the modern Cheynes or Cheyneys,
and Cheyne comes from the old French
word chesne (oak) and "chensnet" might
have been chesne-nut, or chestnut, (oak and
chesnut-chastain - having   possibly  the
same root in French, and their timber, of
which London was built, possessing a good
deal in common), Saxon and Norman
antiquaries might be led into much pleasant
dispute, as to the regal and woodland origin of
the word Kensington; whether the oak and
chestnut trees, which still have representatives
in the district, were the occasion of the name;
or whether some Saxon prince-Alfred, for
instance, who was the rebuilder of London-going
some fine morning to look at his woodcutters,
and considering how healthy the soil
was, and how fresh the western wind blew
upon his brow, chose to set up a summerlodge




<pb id="p.10" n="10"/>

 there, in which to recreate his profound thoughts, and
 benefit the health which
he was injuring for his country. But we
must not be diverted into these speculations.
 </p><p>Whatever was the origin of its name,
there is no doubt that the first inhabited spot
of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> was an enclosure from the
great Middlesex forest, that once occupied
this side of London, and which extended
northwards as far as Barnet. The woody
nature of a portion of the district is implied
in a passage in Doomsday Book; and records
exist, which shew that forest trees were
abundant in it as late as the time of Henry
the Eighth.
</p><p>  The overflowing of the Thames, to which
<placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName> and Hammersmith were subject,
stopped short of the higher ground of
<placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>; there was no great road through it
till comparatively modern times, the only


        <pb id="p.11" n="11"/>

highway for travellers westward, being the
old Roman, or present Uxbridge Road, then
bending southerly (as it still branches) to
Turnham Green; and thus we are to picture
to ourselves the future royal suburb, as
consisting of half-a-dozen rustical tenements of
swineherds and other foresters, clustering
about the homestead of the chieftain or
speculator, whoever he was, that first cleared
away a spot in that corner.   By degrees
dairymen came, and ploughmen; then
vinegrowers; and the first Norman proprietor
we hear of, is a bishop.
  </p><p>"Albericus de Ver tenet de episcopo
  Constantiensi Chenesit(um)."
 </p><p> Aubrey de Vere holds <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> of the
Bishop of Constance.
 </p><p> So writes Doomsday book. Constance is
Coutances in Normandy; and the bishop,
who was, probably, anything but a reverend






<pb id="p.12" n="12"/>

personage, in the modern sense of the
epithet, but a stalwart, jolly fellow, clad in
arms cap-a-pie, was also Grand Justiciary of
England; that is to say, one whose business
it was to do injustice to Englishmen, and
see their goods and chattels delivered over to
his countrymen, the Normans. Accordingly,
to set a good legal example, the Justiciary
seizes upon this manor of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, which
belonged it seems, to one " Edward :" a name
which signifies Happy Keeper. So Happy
Keeper, (unless detained to keep the pigs,)
makes the best of his way off, blessing this
delightful bishop and judge, whose office it
is to oust proprietors; and he is, perhaps,
stripped and murdered, somewhere about
Notting Hill, by his lordship's chaplain.<note place="foot" n="1"> For the crimes and iniquities of the military churchmen
who came over with William of Normandy, see
Thierry's " History of the Conquest," passim.</note>



       <pb id="p.13" n="13"/>

  </p><p>The De Veres, however, who afterwards
gave twenty earls of Oxford to the English
peerage, were not long in becoming absolute
possessors of the Manor of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>; and
they held it, directly or indirectly, from the
time of the Conqueror, nearly up to that of
James the First.  It is doubted, nevertheless,
whether they ever resided there, though there
was a mansion belonging to them, which
occupied a site near the present Holland
House, and which is still represented by
a kind of remnant of a successor.    We
shall have more to say of the family by
and bye.
 </p><p> But whatever was the importance of the
district, as the possession of a race of nobles,
it obtains no distinct or certain image in the
mind of the topographer till <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>
itself makes its appearance, which was not
till the reign of James the First, when it was











<pb id="p.14" n="14"/>

built by Sir Walter Cope, who had
purchased the estate towards the close of the
reign preceding. A succession of noble and
other residents, of whom we shall have to
speak, and who have rendered it one of
the most interesting objects in the
neighbourhood of London, soon brought shops
and houses about it; Campden House, the
seat of Lord Campden, arose not long after
<placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>; the healthiness and fashion
of the place attracted other families of
distinction; and its importance was completed,
when King William bought the house and
grounds of the Finch family (Earls of
Nottingham), and converted the house into
a palace, and the grounds into royal gardens.
Holland  House, Campden     House,
<placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName>, the Square, the Church,
the Palace, and the Gardens, are the seven
oldest objects of interest in Kensington;










         <pb id="p.15" n="15"/>

and lively and abundant are the memorials
which most of them have left us.
 </p><p>But newer creations possess their interest
also, up to the latest period; and it may be
said, without the usual hazards attending
prefatory commendation, that in comparison
with "kingly <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>," as Swift called
it, every other suburb of London, however
interesting in its degree, is but as the strip
of garden before one of its houses,
compared with<placeName key=" Kensington Gardens"> Kensington Gardens</placeName> themselves
during the height of their season.</p>

<p>  WE begin our perambulation, as proposed,
on the side next the metropolis. We should
rather say, next Piccadilly, for the metropolis,
alas! and <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, are now joined;
though from Knightsbridge to the palace,
the houses still occupy only one side of the
way.











           <pb id="p.17" n="17"/>

 </p><p> It is a very pleasant way, especially if you
come through the Park. When we quit
Piccadilly for Hyde Park Corner, we, for our
parts, always fancy, that the air, somehow,
feels not only fresher, but whiter, and this
feeling increases as we find the turf under
our feet, and the fresh air in one's face.
The road-way through Knightsbridge, with
its rows of houses on one side, and its
barracks on the other, is not so agreeable;
though by way of compensation, you have
the chance of having your eyes refreshed
with a dignified serjeant of dragoons, too
fat for his sash, and a tall private, walking
with a little woman.
 </p><p> The long, and again unoccupied side of
the road, in the Park, reaching from  the
Knightsbridge Barracks to within a short
distance of the Gardens, lately presented to
the eyes of the world a spectacle singularly












<pb id="p.18" n="18"/>

illustrative of the advanced character of the
age, and such, we believe, as no attempts
to bring back a worse spirit in Europe will
deprive of its good effects, however
threatening  those attempts may appear.     We
need not say that we allude to the Great
Exhibition. We do not say " Crystal Palace,"
for it was a pity, though it was natural
enough on its first rising with that fairy
suddenness, that the building was so called;
since it was neither crystal nor a palace.
It was a bazaar, admirably constructed for
its purpose, and justly surprising those who
beheld its interior.  When we thought it
was to be destroyed, without renovation
elsewhere, we felt amazed at the selfishness
of such of its rich neighbours as could insist
on the performance of a promise to that
effect notwithstanding the wishes of millions,
restricted in their enjoyments.  But as soon



            <pb id="p.19" n="19"/>

as it was determined that the structure
should re-appear in another quarter, and this
too with those improvements in point of
size and treatment which the designer
himself had longed for power to effect, we felt
as glad to have the old trees and turf back
again, undisturbed, as the most sequestered
of the suburban aristocracies.  We rejoiced
in a result, upon which, in fact, all parties
were to be congratulated; and we began to
own that there certainly had been a dust
and kick-up about the once quiet approach
to <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, a turmoil of crowds, and
omnibuses, and cabs, of hot faces and loud
voices, of stalls, dogs, penny trumpets,
policemen, and extempore public-houses,
which, for the sake of the many themselves,
one could hardly have wished to see
continued, lest they also should ultimately have
missed their portion in the tranquil pleasures












<pb id="p.20" n="20"/>

of the few. A winter-garden, to be sure,
would have been a good thing, and
conservatories and other elegancies, all the year
round, would have been still better; but all
these we are promised in the new premises
at Sydenham; and though the near
neighbourhood of London was an advantage in
some respects, it was not such in others.
Multitudes became somewhat too
multitudinous. European brotherhood itself, now
and then, felt its toes trodden upon a little
too sharply. The most generous emulations,
if they want elbow-room, are in danger of
relapsing into antagonisms. A juvenile wit,
in the shape of a pot-boy, who appears to
have possessed a profound natural insight
into this tendency of the meeting of extremes,
cried out one day to a couple of foreigners
who were showing symptoms of a set-to,
" Go it, all nations."

 </p><p> The road from Knightsbridge to
 <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, which the Great Exhibition looked on,
is called the Gore; a word, which with the
surveyor as well as the semstress, appears
to mean a slip or graft of something in
addition, and of the shape of a blunted cone;
though the elegance to which the spot has
attained, must not let us forget, that the
same word has been employed in the sense
of " mud and dirt," and that the road in
this quarter used to be in very bad condition.
Lord Hervey, writing towards the middle
of the last century, describes it as shocking.
And the royal roads through the Park were
little better.
 </p><p> "The removing from   <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> to St.
James's, for the purpose of facilitating the
Queen's intercourse with ministers, seems in
our days (observes the editor of his lordship's
'Memoirs,') very singular; but the following


<pb id="p.22" n="22"/>

 extract from a letter to his mother,
dated 27th November, <date value="1736">1736</date>, will explain it.
 </p><p> "' The road between this place
 (<placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> and London) is grown so infamously
bad, that we live here in the same solitude
as we should do if cast on a rock in the
middle of the ocean; and all the Londoners
tell us there is between them and us a great
impassable gulf of mud.   There are two
ways through the Park, but the new one
is so convex, and the old one so concave,

 Chudleigh, of whom we have had a glimpse by
anticipation in <placeName key="?">Kensington Gardens</placeName>-was an
adventuress, who, after playing tricks with
a parish register for the purpose of alternately
falsifying and substantiating a real marriage,
according as the prospects of her husband
varied, imposed herself on a duke for a
spinster, and survived him as his duchess till
unmasked by a Court of Law.
 </p><p> She was a well-born and handsome, but
coarse-minded woman, qualified to impose on
none but very young or very shallow
admirers. Her first husband, who became Earl
of Bristol, was at the time of his marriage
a young seaman, just out of his teens; and





<pb id="p.24" n="24"/>
the Duke, her second husband, though he
was nephew of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,
appears never to have outgrown the teens of
his understanding.
 </p><p> Hating prolixity and mock-modesty, her
ladyship's maxim, we are told, was to be
"short, clear, and surprising ;" so she
concentrated her rhetoric into swearing, and
dressed in a style next to nakedness. The
wealth, however, which was bequeathed her
by the Duke, enabled her, in spite of the
loss of his title in England, to go and flare
as a Duchess abroad, where her jewels
procured her the friendship of sovereigns, and the
Pope figured in her will.
 </p><p> MarquisWellesley redeems Kingston House
from the disgrace of its origin; for he was
a highly refined personage. Some thought
him too refined; and stories were told of the
care which he took of his complexion. Fastidious




        <pb id="p.25" n="25"/>

 he certainly was; fond of pomp and
show when he governed India; and a little
too superfine, perhaps, in his tastes always.
There was a curious difference in these, as
well as in some other respects, between him
and his brother, the great soldier. But we
must not lightly believe stories to the
disparagement of those who mingle infirmities
with great qualities.
 </p><p> What is certain of the Marquis Wellesley
is that, with all his aristocratic drawbacks,
he was a man of gentle and kindly manners;
very generous; an energetic, judicious, and,
upon the whole, singularly liberal statesman
for an extender of empire; and that the
passion in him which survived all others, was
a love of the classical studies of his boyhood.
This was so strong, that he directed himself
to be buried at Eton College, where he
had  been brought up-a triumphant testimony,












<pb id="p.26" n="26"/>

 surely, to the natural goodness of his
heart.
  </p><p> It is affecting to our common humanity
to see one of the most public of statesmen,
and one of the most sequestered of poets
(Gray, in his Ode) thus meeting on the same
good old ground of boyish reminiscence.</p><p>

   <quote rend="blockquote">  "Ah, happy hills ! ah, pleasing shade!
         Ah, fields belov'd in vain!
     Where once my careless childhood stray'd,
         A stranger yet to pain !"</quote>


Not "in vain," however, if their influence
thus accompanies us through life, and greets
our approaches to the grave.
 </p><p>  It is said that the Duke of Wellington,
who visited the Marquis to the last, was
sometimes kept waiting; upon which he
remarked, one day, "I believe my brother
thinks he is still Governor-General of India,



           <pb id="p.27" n="27"/>

and that I am only Colonel Wellesley." It
is not impossible that, from old habit and a
little bit of civil grudge against military
ascendancy (but all in a spirit of kindliness,
which the sensible Duke would understand
and indulge) the elder brother did not dislike
to keep up his privileges of primogeniture.
</p><p>  A curious local pre-eminence attends
Kingston House, little suspected by those who
pass it. It stands on the highest ground
between London and <placeName key="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</placeName>.
 </p><p> Next to this mansion is a row of new
houses, each too high for its width, called
<placeName key="Princes Gate">Prince's Gate</placeName>. They resemble a set of tall
thin gentlemen, squeezing together to look
at something over the way.
 </p><p> The old wall containing their neighbour,
Park House, indicates the northern boundary
of the once famous <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> or Brompton
Park Nursery, which figures in the pages of





<pb id="p.28" n="28"/>
the " Spectator " as the establishment of
Messieurs London and Wise, the most celebrated
gardeners of their time.  It commenced in
the reign of Charles the Second; furnished
all England with plants; and is only now
giving up its last green ghost before the rise
of new buildings.

 <p> WE have said that <placeName key="Kensington Gore ">Kensington Gore</placeName>, in
Red Books and Directories, is understood to
begin at Kingston (or Ennismore) House.
And such is the case. But as the only rows
of houses, till of late years, that is to say, of
houses in actual conjunction, were that which
you pass just before reaching the Cabinet
Exhibition, and another lower down the road,












<pb id="p.30" n="30"/>
the former of these rows is still inscribed,
"<placeName key="Kensington Gore ">Kensington Gore</placeName>," and is the spot
emphatically so called.  It is also, to distinguish
it from the other, sometimes called the Upper
Gore.  We notice it the more particularly,
because it is remarkable, among other respects,
for its style of building.  It consists but of
five houses, four of which are faced with
white stucco, all of them very small, and
Nos. 2 and 3 apparently consisting but of one
room, a drawing-room, with six windows.
Yet they have an air of elegance, and even
of distinction. They look as if they had
been intended for the out-houses, or lodge,
of some great mansion which was never
built; and, as if, upon the failure of that
project, they had been divided into apartments
for retainers of the Court. You might imagine
that a supernumerary set of maids of honour
had lived there (if maids of honour could



          <pb id="p.31" n="31"/>

live alone); or that five younger brother of
lords of the bed-chamber had been the
occupants-all being bachelors and expecting
places in reversion. The two houses which
seem to be nothing but one drawing-room,
possess, however, parlours and second stories
at the back, and have good gardens; so that
what with their flowers behind them, the
park in front, and their own neatness and
elegance, the miniature aristocracy of their
appearance is not ill borne out.
 </p><p> In the year <date value="1816">1816</date>, Mrs. Inchbald (of whom
more hereafter) knocked at the door of one of
these houses, in hopes of getting the
apartments that were to let; but the
lodginghouse lady was so fine a personage, and so
very unaccommodating, besides reserving all
the prospect for herself, and charging a
round sum for the rooms which had no
prospect, that the authoress of the " Simple












<pb id="p.32" n="32"/>

Story" indignantly walked off.  She says
that the furniture was crazy; that she would
not have accepted the first floor, had it been
offered her for nothing; and that one of her
big trunks would have taken up half the
bedroom.</p><p>
  Since that day, there is reason to believe,
that the furniture has much improved; for
besides the air of taste which is diffused over
all the little stuccoed houses, they have boasted
divers inhabitants of worship: and at No 5,
for a short time, lived Count d'Orsay. We
shall have more to say of this distinguished
person a little further on, when we come to
Gore House. But it is impossible to mention
such a "glass of fashion, and mould of
form," without stopping a moment to look
at him with our "mind's eye;" and as care
had not yet overtaken him while residing at
this house, we cannot but observe at once




      <pb id="p.33" n="33"/>

how truly he merited the application of those
words of Shakspeare.
  </p><p>To see d'Orsay coming up a lobby, or a
drawing-room, was a sight; his face was so
delicate, his figure so manly, and his white
waistcoat so ample and august. We happened
once to see him and O'Connell sitting
opposite one another, the latter with a waistcoat
to match; and we were at a loss to think
which had the finer " thorax" of the two-the
great Irishman, who thundered across
the channel, or the magnificent French
Adonis, who seemed to ennoble dandyism.
 </p><p> Over the doorway of No. 2 is a vase; and
as old inhabitants do not remember when this
vase was set up, it was not improbably a
manifestation of his classical taste by a once
much talked of person; for in this house, a
little sequestered establishment was kept by









<pb id="p.34" n="34"/>

as much over-estimated perhaps by his
admirers, for a patriotism which was never
thoroughly disinterested, as he was depreciated
for a libertinism, by no means unaccompanied
with good qualities.  "Jack Wilkes," as he
was familiarly called-member of parliament,
alderman, fine gentleman, scholar, coarse wit,
and middling writer, was certainly an "
impudent dog," in more senses than that of " Jack
Absolute" in the play.   Excess of animal
spirits, and the want of any depth of
perception into some of the gravest questions, led
him into outrages against decorum, that were
justly denounced by all but the hypocritical.
Nevertheless, the country is indebted to him
for more than one benefit, particularly the
freedom from arbitrary arrest; and the two
daughters that Jack left behind him,
illegitimate as well as legitimate, were models of
well-educated, sensible women, as fond of

              <pb id="p.35" n="35"/>

their father, as he had shown himself fond of
them.   The popularity to which he had
attained at one time, was immense. "Wilkes
and Liberty," was the motto of the universal
English nation. It was on every wall;
sometimes on every door, and on every coach (to
enable it to get along); it stamped the
butter-pats, the biscuits, the handkerchiefs;
in short, had so identified one word with the
other, that a wit, writing to somebody, began
his letter with, " Sir, I take the Wilkes and
liberty to assure you."
 </p><p> Wilkes prospered so well by his patriotism,
that he maintained three establishments at a
time; one in the Isle of Wight, for the
summer; another in    Grosvenor Square,
where his daughter Mary kept house for
him; and the third at this place in
<placeName key="Kensington Gore ">Kensington Gore</placeName>, where his second daughter,
Harriet, lived with her mother, a Mrs.




<pb id="p.36" n="36"/>
Arnold, who assisted in training her with a
propriety that must have been thought
remarkable. The first daughter, who was as
plain and as lively as her father, died unmarried,
universally lamented. The other, a very
agreeable lady, in face as well as in manners, we
had the pleasure of seeing once, in company
with her husband, the late estimable
Sergeant Rough, who became a judge in India,
and who deplored her loss.
 </p><p> A <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> memorandum by Wilkes
will show what high visitors he had, and how
well he could entertain them.
  </p><p>"Mr. Swinburne dined with me last
  Sunday, with Monsieur Barthelemi, and the
Counts Woronzow and Nesselrode. I gave
them the chicken-turtle, dressed at the
London Tavern, a haunch of venison, and was
served by James and Samuel from Prince's
Court, who behave very well.   The day




               <pb id="p.37" n="37"/>

passed very cheerfully, and they all expressed
themselves highly delighted."
 </p><p> Wilkes, who lived to a good age, owing
probably to his love of exercise, was in the
habit, to the last, of walking from
<placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> to the city, deaf to the solicitations of
the hackney-coachmen, and not at all
minding, or rather, perhaps, courting, the attention
of everybody else to an appearance, which
must always have been remarkable.
Personal defects deprecate or defy notice,
according to the disposition of the individual.
Wilkes was not disposed to deprecate
anything.  He was tall, meagre, and sallow,
with an underhung, grinning, good-hu-moured jaw, and an obliquity of vision,
which, however objectionable in the eyes of
opponents, occasioned the famous vindication
from a partizan, that its possessor did not
"squint more than   a gentleman should."







<pb id="p.38" n="38"/>
Upon the strength of his having been a
Colonel of Militia, the venerable patriot
daily attired his person in a suit of scarlet
and buff, with a rosette in his cocked-hat,
and a pair of military boots; and the reader
may  fancy  him  thus  coming   towards
Knightsbridge, ready to take off the hat in
the highest style of good-breeding to
anybody that courted it, or to give the
gentleman " satisfaction," if he was disrespectful to
the squint.  For Wilkes was as brave as he
was light-hearted.  He was an odd kind of
English-Frenchman, that had strayed into
Farringdon Ward Without; and he
ultimately mystified both King and people; for
he was really of no party, but that of
pleasure and a fine coat. The best thing about
him was his love of his daughters; just as
the pleasantest thing in the French is their
walking about with their families on the



          <pb id="p.39" n="39"/>

Boulevards, after all the turbulence and
volatility of their insurrections.
  </p><p>But an interest attaches to this house of
Wilkes's, far beyond these pleasant
anomalies; for here Junius visited. At this
door, knocking towards dinner-time, might
be seen a tall, good-looking gentleman, of
an imposing presence, who, if anybody
passing by had known who he was, and had
chosen to go and tell it, might have been
the making of the man's fortune. This was
Philip Francis, afterwards one of the denouncers
of Hastings, ultimately Sir Philip Francis,
K.B., and now, since the publication of
Mr. Taylor's book on the subject, understood
to be that " mighty boar of the forest," as
Burke called him, trampling down all before
him, the author of "Junius's Letters." Mrs.
Rough said, that he dined at <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>
frequently, and that he once cut off a lock











<pb id="p.40" n="40"/>
of her hair.  She was then a child. She
only knew him as Mr. Francis; but she had
"an obscure imagination that her father once
said she had met Junius."  He might so, in
after days; but we feel convinced that Wilkes
did not know him for Junius at the time.
He treats the latter, in his correspondence,
with a reverence which was not compatible
with " Wilkes and liberty." He took Junius,
we suspect, to be Burke or Chatham,
probably the latter. He once, it is true, when
Lord Mayor, invited the great unknown to a
ball, adding, in a truly French style of
classical allusion (then the tone of the day)
how happy he should be to see " his Portia
(Miss Wilkes) dance a graceful minuet with
Junius Brutus." But Junius Brutus saw the
absurdity of the conjunction; answering,
"that he acknowledged the relation between
'Cato and Portia,' but in truth could see no





           <pb id="p.41" n="41"/>

connection between Junius and a minuet.
His age and figure, too," he said, "would
have done little credit to his partner." In a
previous letter, Wilkes had said, that he did
not mean to indulge " the impertinent
curiosity of finding out the most important secret
of our times, the author of 'Junius.'  He
would not attempt with profane hands to
tear the veil of the sanctuary. He was
disposed, with the inhabitants of Attica, to
erect 'an altar to the unknown god' of our
political idolatry, and would be content to
worship him in clouds and darkness." Upon
which not inelegant comparison, Junius, still
keeping his state, though smiling with
condescending pleasantry, observes, that he is
"much flattered, as Mr. Wilkes politely
intended he should be, with the worship he
is pleased to pay to the unknown god. I
find," he continues, "I am treated as other











<pb id="p.42" n="42"/>

gods usually are by their votaries, with
sacrifice and ceremony in abundance, and
very little obedience. The profession of your
faith is nexceptionable; but I am a modest
deity, and should be full as well satisfied
with good works and morality."    This is
admirable, and full of matter; but it is not
the style that could have occurred between
John Wilkes, Esquire, Sheriff of London,
possessor of three establishments, and Mr.
Francis, at that time Clerk in the War
Office, and in the habit of dining at his
table.  We must add, that we take Lord
Chatham, Burke, and Earl Temple, to have
been in the secret of "Junius's Letters ;"
that the two former objects of his admiration
stimulated his manner, and that not
improbably they occasionally furnished him with
remarks. Nor would it have surprised us,
had Temple turned out to be Junius himself.





        <pb id="p.43" n="43"/>
But this is not the place for discussing the
question.</p><p>
  We take the opportunity of giving a
variation of the story which Mr. Taylor
relates respecting the behaviour of Sir Philip
at the table of George the Fourth.  " Sir
Philip," says Mr. Taylor, "was impetuous,
and somewhat abrupt in manner. He once
interrupted George the Fourth at the royal
table (and we are credibly informed that he
frequently dined there) in the midst of a
tedious story, with a ' Well, Sir, well!' "
  </p><p>Our version of this anecdote, without
meaning to impugn Mr. Taylor's authority,
which, not improbably, is the same as our
own, differently reported, is, that Sir Philip
being excessively tired, not only with the
story in question, but with others of the
same sort which he was in the habit of
hearing at the same table, interrupted the











<pb id="p.44" n="44"/>

royal narration with the politer, but not less
significant words: "Well, and the result,
Sir, if you please." The result was, that
he was never invited more; and our
informant added, that as such a penalty was certain,
it is not improbable that it was deliberately
incurred.
  </p><p>If any of our readers, who agree with
Mr. Taylor in thinking Sir Philip Francis to
have been Junius, should regret their never
having seen that once invisible personage, we
have the pleasure of informing them, that
the portrait prefixed to the volume of
"Junius Identified," is a fac-simile of the
man. We met Sir Philip once coming down
Bond Street, and knew him by the likeness.</p>

 <p>THE vicissitudes in the occupation of
houses are curious.   The first tenant we
meet with in Gore House, (we forget his
name,) is a government contractor, who was
so stingy, that he would not lay out a penny
to keep his garden in order. To him
succeeded Mr. Wilberforce, famous in the annals





<pb id="p.46" n="46"/>

of evangelism  and the slave-trade.  The
next distinguished name is Lady
Blessington, who is joined by Count d'Orsay. Then
comes Monsieur Soyer, who turns the place
into an eating-house for "All Nations"
during the Great Exhibition. And now it
has been bought by government, in
connexion with the new views for the
cultivation of art.
  </p><p>Wilberforce, whose head was not strong
enough to keep him out of the pale of
religious bigotry, but whose heart was
kindly, and his temperament happy,
contrived (though it is difficult to conceive
how even the merriest of such theologians
manage it,) to combine the most terrific
ideas of the next world (for others) with the
most comfortable enjoyment of this world
in his own person. He was a little
plainfaced man, radiant by nature with glee and




           <pb id="p.47" n="47"/>

good humour, very "serious " at a moment's
notice, an earnest devotee, a genial host, a
good speaker and member of parliament;
now siding, and now differing with his friend
Pitt; now joining in devotion with Lord
Teignmouth; now    laughing heartily with
Canning; now sighing over the table-talk
of the Prince Regent; but above all, deep
in tractarianism, and at the same time
advocating the freedom of the poor negroes;
which was by no means the case with all
persons of his way of thinking, political or
religious.
  </p><p>"About a year and three-quarters ago,"
says this worthy, ultra-serio-comic person, "I
changed my residence, and found myself in
the habitation which my family now occupies,
and which we find more salubrious than
Clapham Common. We are just one mile
from the turnpike-gate at Hyde Park Corner,





<pb id="p.48" n="48"/>
which I think you will not have forgotten
yet, having about three acres of pleasure-ground
around my house, or rather behind
it, and several old trees, walnut and
mulberry, of thick foliage.  I can sit and read
under their shade, which I delight in doing,
with as much admiration of the beauties
of nature (remembering at the same time
the words of my favourite poet: 'Nature is
but a name for an effect, whose cause is
God,') as if I were two hundred miles from
the great city."
 </p><p> This is excellent, and would have been
more so, if Mr. Wilberforce could have
allowed others, not quite of the same creed,
to have the same right to a comfortable
enjoyment of nature, and the same
reputation for piety.  He was of opinion that
you must be continually thinking of God,
otherwise God would be very angry.   As





          <pb id="p.49" n="49"/>

if the Divine Father could not dispense with
these eternal references to him from his
children, or would burthen them with the
weight of even too much gratitude ! Our
prosperous and lively-blooded saint, however,
bore the burthen with singular vivacity,
owing to a notion hehad (hardly burthened
with modesty, though he always professed
to wonder at the circumstance,) that he was a
special favourite of God.
 </p><p>  His meditations down <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>-road
were certainly very different from those
of Mr. Wilkes.
  </p><p> " Walked," he says, in his Diary, "from
Hyde Park Corner, repeating   the  119th
psalm, in great comfort."
  </p><p> This is the longest of the psalms,
  extending to a hundred and seventy-six verses, full
of pious self-congratulation, and of rebukes of
its deriders.

 </p><p>An anecdote of Wilberforce in connexion
with the present royal family, we reserve
for our notices of the palace.
 </p><p>Of the successors of this devout person in
the occupancy of Gore House so much
has been said of late, in consequence of the
appearance of a book in three large octavo
volumes, entitled   "The Literary    Life and
Correspondence    of  the Countess of Blessington,"  that readers    of  a   work   like
the present will probably expect us to
give our opinion on the subject at greater
length, than would otherwise have been
the case. <note place="foot" n="1">The feelings of the book, as far as the chief persons
in it are concerned, are in the main correct; and the
author might have attained the repute of moderate powers
of reflection and an altogether laudable object. But the
three volumes ought, at the utmost, to have been two;
and the manufactured nature of the rest (to say nothing
worse of it) should have rendered him cautious how he
went out of his way to censure judgments which he does
not understand.</note>

  </p><p> Marguerite Gardiner (not Blessington, as
the author has it, misled by the way in
which peeresses sign their names) was the
daughter of Edmund Power, Esq., a country
gentleman of small property in <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>, and
was born at Knockbril, near Clonmel, in
the county of Tipperary, on the 1st of
September, <date value="1790">1790</date>. Her father appears to
have been a man half mad with brutality.
At the age of fourteen and a half, she was
married to a captain in the army, of the
name of Farmer, whose temper is said to
have resembled her father's, and from
whom she separated; and, in her eight-and-twentieth year, she took for her second
husband, Charles John (Gardiner) Earl of
Blessington, who was a man equally half


<pb id="p.52" n="52"/>
mad with self-will, though in a quieter
shape, with the addition of prodigality and
love of show. All these persons helped to
perplex and unsettle her character.
 </p><p>During a space of eight years, Lord and
Lady Blessington travelled and resided on
the continent-chiefly in <placeName key="Italy">Italy</placeName>-accompanied
by a niece of her ladyship's, and by Count
Alfred d'Orsay, son of General Count d'Orsay,
one of the old French noblesse. The young
Count was invited to be of the party by
Lord Blessington, who became so extremely
attached to him, that nothing would content
him but Alfred must marry one of his
daughters by a former wife, (he did not
care which) and so become possessed of a
portion of his estates.  His lordship, also,
after the death of his only legitimate son,
made him guardian of the son's brother.
Alfred, in the year <date value="1827">1827</date>, at Naples, married

          <pb id="p.53" n="53"/>

the daughter, without love on either side.
Lord Blessington died of apoplexy in the
year <date value="1829">1829</date>, at <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>. His widow, with Count
and Countess Alfred, returned to England,
and took up her abode in Seamore Place,
May Fair, where she resided till the year <date value="1836">1836</date>,
in the course of which time the married couple
parted, having lived together ten years; and,
on Lady Blessington's removal from Seamore
Place to <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, the Count accompanied
her thither, and, from that time up to their
departure from England, appears to have
resided in the same house, with the exception
of a short stay at the little domicile before
mentioned. Lady Blessington was then in
her forty-fifth year, and the Count in his
thirty-fourth.
  </p><p>The house soon became a point of attraction, particularly in the world of letters,
her Ladyship, besides giving such dinners as







<pb id="p.54" n="54"/>
Dr. Johnson would have thought " being
worth asked to," delighting to bring men of
different opinions together, for the purpose
of softening asperities, and making them take
a liking to one another, on better acquaintance.
In this benevolent project she was
assisted by the Count; and here, accordingly,
with somewhat of an excess on the side of
universality, were to be seen poets and prose
writers, both Tory and Whig, distinguished
journalists, Edinburgh and Quarterly
reviewers, with actors, artists, travellers, exiles,
&amp;c., Thomas Moore being the senior among
the poets, and Prince Louis Napoleon at the
head of the exiles. Every celebrated novelist,
in particular, naturally made one of a circle,
over which presided the charming woman,
who was herself a novelist.
 </p><p>We do not hear of ladies among the
visitors, though the Countess appears to


       <pb id="p.55" n="55"/>

have had cordial female friends.  This was
a defect, however, that was to be looked for
in a country like England, in consequence
of appearances-the residence in the same
house of a beautiful widow of five-and-forty,
with a model of a man aged thirty-four,
suggesting, it seems, no possibilities of self-restraint to the sober fancies of our beloved
countrymen.  Yet, in his last days, when
the hand of death was upon him, the Count
said to their friend and biographer, the tears,
all the while, pouring down his face, "She
was to me a mother! a dear, dear mother!
a true loving mother to me !" And referring
to her again, he said, "You understand
me."  "I understood him   to be speaking
what he felt," continues his friend; "and
there was nothing in his accents, in his
position, or his expressions, (for his words
sounded in my ears like those of a dying





<pb id="p.56" n="56"/>
man which led me to believe he was seeking
to deceive himself or me."
</p><p> These parties at Gore House have been
compared with those of <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, and
with the companies that assembled at the
mansion of Lady Charleville. Of the latter,
no memorialist has enabled us to speak; but,
with the former, they appear to have had
little in common, except the power on the
part of some of the visitors to have furnished
it, had the hostess so desired.  It is stated
that she latterly assumed too dictatorial a
manner, and that the parties were not so
natural and so lively as they had been in
Seamore Place. This may have been owing,
partly to her pursuit of literature, and partly
to a sense of the coming difficulties; and
there was one drawback on the agreeableness
of the society, and even on the benevolence
of purpose above mentioned, in bringing



          <pb id="p.57" n="57"/>

it together, which we should not have
expected to find in any society of the like
description-to wit, a love of banter, and
a habit of what is called, "fetching out"
people's absurdities and self-committals; a
practice, generally speaking, which none are
so prompt to be offended with, as the " fetchers
out." But the habit, instead of being discouraged, was flattered; and flattery, of one
kind or another, was the ruin of the poor
handsome Count and Countess.     Nobody,
of course, contemplated such a result; and
the flattery was very natural; for they were
accomplished  as well as handsome    and
kind-hearted persons, notwithstanding that
mistake.
 </p><p>The establishment broke down in <date value="1849">1849</date>
under a load of debt for party-giving, for
dress, for jewellery, for play (on the part of
the Count), and even for charity's self and






<pb id="p.58" n="58"/>
the giving of pensions; both the friends
being bountiful to the poor, one of them
supporting poor relations, and the other helping
to do as much for poor exiles.   For
though it is rightly said that people ought
to be just before they are generous, yet when
tradesmen give long credits, reckoning upon
enormous receipts, their unreflecting victims
naturally suppose they can "wait," and that
the poor had better be helped first. The
Count's boots and hats were advertisements,
for the sake of which the shoemakers and
hatters were content to wait, till things
looked awkward; and then the long credit,
having served the purpose of an usurious
patience, was to be made the ground of a
realising exasperation.
 </p><p>The downfall was unlooked for by the
public, but not by acquaintances. Four years
previous to it the Count was so embarrassed,




           <pb id="p.59" n="59"/>

that in a schedule of his liabilities drawn
up by himself, the claims of his creditors
amounted to a hundred and seven thousand
pounds; and his biographer adds, that there
were debts to friends, amounting probably
to thirteen thousand more.   In vain the
Countess kept an eye on the household
expenses; in vain she thought to turn a jointure
of two thousand a-year into four thousand,
by "literature;" in vain the Count resorted
even to alchemy; in vain, as a last resource,
he thought to benefit by those fine arts, in
which he excelled as an amateur.   Time
was not given him for the trial. He had
fled to <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>; there was a sale of the goods
at Gore House; the Countess followed him;
and the last hope of the refugees was in the
Prince President of the French Republic,
lately the favourite guest at their table,
always their protege' and type of progress






<pb id="p.60" n="60"/>
But the man of the reserved tongue and
drooping eyelids, was plotting his way to a
throne.  He liked neither the sincerity, nor
the humanity, of his once cherished adviser,
the Count; and having discarded his
mistress, and looked for a wife, he probably
affected a new  kind of reserve with the
Countess, as a setter of imperial example.
The poor lady died of apoplexy; which,
under certain kinds of trial, means a shock
of despair; and the gentleman only
received an appointment, when it was too
late for him to discharge it.  Strong and
fine a man as he had been, he speedily
followed her to the grave, aged no more
than fifty-one.
 </p><p>The secret of the unlooked for deaths of
these two remarkable persons will still be a
subject for discussion; nor do we profess to
be in the least degree acquainted with it,




         <pb id="p.61" n="61"/>

unless it is explained by    appearances.  In
our opinion, these   are quite sufficient for
the explanation. They had taken Louis Napoleon for a man of feeling, and they thought
they should die dishonoured, or doubted, by
creditors-and by creditor friends; for the
proceeds of the sale of Gore House did not
amount to more than the Count's debts to
his friends, and what would clamorous tradesmen say to those ? The Countess, also, was
to subsist; and what was she to do for the
Count, or he for her? Injured in hope, in
health, and in   expectation, their pangs of
mind, under all the circumstances, may naturally have been enough to kill them;       and
we believe they did.<note place="foot" n="2">It is proper to observe, that the opinions here expressed
regarding Louis Napoleon's behaviour to the Count and
Countess originate in statements made by their friends,
and that a counter-statement on his part might, of course,demand for them a new consideration. We are loth also
to say anything against the ally of England and the guest
of the Queen; and willing to believe, notwithstanding
his antecedents, that he not only desires to promote the
new cordiality between <placeName key="France">France</placeName> and England out of motives
better than merely selfish ones, but has objects, for a
despot, in furtherance of the good of the poor and the
general progress of the community.  But those antecedents, and the melancholy doubts taught us by history,
forbid the best-disposed of his observers to take promises for performance, or one set of extremes for another.
The utmost which they find it possible to do, is to await
the evidence of events, and to feel no wonder meantime at the incredulity of the consistent and the
outraged.

<pb id="p.62" n="62"/>
  </p><p>As to the other and more delicate secret,
nothing perhaps is, or can be known of it,
beyond the fact of their having lived in
the same house; which, if considered a
scandal in   England, and     of evil example,
(and it undoubtedly was so considered, and
very naturally) is to   be judged   at the same


          <pb id="p.63" n="63"/>

time, with reference to those foreign usages,
to which one of them had been born and
bred, and the other (in residences abroad)
accustomed.
 </p><p>The Count's high-born and respected
kindred-his    mother   included -  never
ceased to express their esteem and affection for the Countess; female relations
of hers, themselves esteemed by the estimable, lived with her, and were witnesses
of her habits; and if it be asked us, whether
we are still " green " enough to believe that
there was nothing in the connexion beyond
the ill-appearance of it, we answer, that
we leave those to believe the worst, who
choose it; that a brave man's tears, in his
dying moments, go a great way with us;
that Irish and French vivacity combined,
in a grave country, might be tempted or
provoked into hazarding an amount of misconstruction,










<pb id="p.64" n="64"/>

 inconceivable to our national
habits; and, finally, that till the nation
itself is  bold  and  virtuous  enough  to
look into the cause of certain other habits
of its own, which it suffers to scandalize
its towns and cities in open day, beyond
those of any other country in Europe, it
had better draw as little attention as possible
to comparisons between itself and its neighbours.
 </p><p>The worst thing known of Count d'Orsay,
is his marriage with a girl of fifteen, without
love on either side, in compliance with the
wish of a half insane father, and for the
purpose of obtaining a fortune.    In  an
Englishman, this would have been very bad
conduct indeed, and often is.  At least, similar
things are often done among us, if not
precisely under the same circumstances.  In
a Frenchman, the conduct would be equally



          <pb id="p.65" n="65"/>

bad, if he reflected upon it apart from national
custom; but custom in <placeName key="France">France</placeName>, or in <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>,
(which is <placeName key="France">France</placeName> itself, as affects the world)
has rendered marriage in general not only
a matter of understood expediency, but of
an expediency very different from our own,
both as regards the restraints of its antecedents,
and the independence of it results.
In England, the expediency is practised, but
with conditions as inexorable on one side, as
they are lax on the other; and hence, among
other causes, the national scandal above
alluded to.
 </p><p>But enough of these questions in a book
not intended to moot them.  It is creditable
to Count d'Orsay and to his friends in general,
that whatever fears he may have had of
exceptions in particular instances, they
retained a belief in his good qualities to the
last, and this too not only in spite of his











<pb id="p.66" n="66"/>
pecuniary difficulties, but even of the
obligations which they led him to incur.   It
was a piece of good fortune, which many a
poor honest man must at once have rejoiced
in and have envied-rejoiced in, to think
that good intentions are not always to be
doubted from inability to carry them out;
and envied, because it was out of his
power to cut the same redeeming figure
of personal and aristocratical enchantingness.
 </p><p>In the interest occasioned by the rest of
her story, we have forgotten to speak of the
Countess as a writer; and much need not be
said.  She had an easy, elegant, and sometimes interesting pen; had the art of
recommending liberal and amiable opinions
without offending conventionality; and wrote
better than any one else on the character of
her acquaintance, Lord Byron.    But her

       <pb id="p.67" n="67"/>

works are not original or strong enough to
last.
  </p><p>The ground on which Gore House stands
forms part of the district which is to be
occupied by the new National Gallery, its
schools of art and science, and its bowers for
the exhibition of sculpture.    A  display of
cabinet work and of studies from the schools
of art has already commenced operations,
and the public are re-admitted to the grounds.
All this, it must be allowed, is a good absorption of the antecedent individualities, pleasant
as some of them were; though it is to be
doubted, whether Mr. Wilberforce's ghost
will be quite easy at the sight of the Venuses
and Apollos.<note place="foot" n="3">The observations which here follow on the cultivation
 of the Beautiful, are retained in the present book,
though they were suggested by a transient exhibition, the
observations on which are retained for the same reason;
namely, because it is hoped they refer sufficiently to general
principles to warrant the retention of the particulars. It is
hoped, also, that they may be considered a foretast e of
what the locality is intended to do for us in succeeding
exhibitions.</note>

  </p><p>England, a teacher of nations in so many
respects, is but now discovering, what has
so long been known to <placeName key="Italy">Italy</placeName> and partially
known to <placeName key="France">France</placeName>-that utility and beauty,
instead of being antagonists, are friends; that
the one without the other, besides being in
danger of falling into the gross and the sordid,
cannot thoroughly work out its purposes;
form, and    proportion,   and   adaptation   of
means to ends, being constituent qualities
of the beautiful; and finally, that as Nature,
far from disliking the beautiful, thought fit to
be the cause of it, and loves it, and deals in
it to profusion, often in the very humblest of
her productions, so it becomes Art to imitate


             <pb id="p.69" n="69"/>

her great mistress in the like impartiality of
adornment, and shew us what opulence and
what elevation, in the scale of discerning
beings, await the perceptions of those, whose
ideas are not limited to the commonest forms
of the desirable. The use of art itself is but
to administer to our satisfactions; and the
use of beauty is to refine and perfect those
satisfactions, and raise them by degrees, in
proportion as we cultivate a true sense of
it, to thoughts of the beauty and goodness of
its great First Cause.  To ask with a sneer
what is the use of beauty, is to ask with
impiety why God has filled the universe with
beauty; why he has made the skies blue,
and the fields green, and vegetation full of
flowers, and the human frame a model for the
sculptor, and gifted everything in existence
with shape and colour.    The commonest
piece of grass, with the straightness of its







<pb id="p.70" n="70"/>
stem, the flowing contrast of its leaves, and
the trembling fullness of its ears, is a miracle
of beauty:-so rich in grace and suggestiveness has it pleased Him to make the houses of
the very insects, and the food of cattle!
Is it not better to discern this, in addition to
the other uses of grass, than to see in it
nothing but those uses ? nothing but hay for
the market, and so much return of money
to the grower?    Very good things both,
no doubt, and not to be dispensed with; but so
much the more requiring the accompaniment
of nobler perceptions, to hinder us from
concluding that man was made to live by
" bread alone;" that is to say, by the satisfaction of his material, as opposed to his spiritual
wants. So little was this the conclusion of
the good Emperor and philosopher, Marcus
Antoninus, that with the uncontemptuous
eye of a sage, and with a curious familiar


           <pb id="p.71" n="71"/>

anticipation of that sense of the picturesque
which has been thought, by some, peculiar
to modern times, he directs our attention to
the outside of a very loaf, as possessing something graceful and attractive in its ruggedness, or what an artist would call the " freedom
of its forms." The whole passage in his
" Meditations," is itself so beautiful, and in spite
of his want of thorough artistic perception as
to form and line, expands into such a comprehensive and noble sense of what has been
termed the Art of Nature, that although we
have already kept the reader standing much
longer than we intended at the steps of Gore
House with this prefatory digression on such
matters, we are sure he will be pleased at
having it laid before him.
  </p><p>"Such things as ensue upon what is well
constituted by nature, have something graceful and attractive.  Thus, some parts of a







<pb id="p.72" n="72"/>
well-baked loaf will crack and become rugged. What is thus cleft beyond the design
of the baker, looks well, and invites the
appetite.  So when figs are at the ripest,
they begin to crack. Thus in full ripe olives,
their approach to putrefaction gives the proper
beauty to the fruit.  Thus, the ladened ear
of corn hanging down, the stern brow of the
lion, and the foam flowing from the mouth of
the boar, and many other things, considered
apart, have nothing comely; yet because of
their connexion with things natural, they
adorn them, and delight the spectator. Thus,
to one who has a deep affection of soul, and
penetrates into the constitution of the whole,
scarce anything connected with nature will
fail to recommend itself agreeably to him.
Thus, the real vast jaws of savage beasts
will please him, no less than the imitations
of them by painters or statuaries.

</p><p> Yes, most excellent Emperor! and the
same might have been said by thee, and
probably was said, of the commonest objects
of art round about thee, in thy home and
thy goods and chattels, thy cabinets and
caskets and chains; for art is nature's doing
also, being the work of her workmanship,
man, and all forms and graces being referable
to her suggestion.  The chair, as well as
the plant, has its straight and its flowing
lines; the casket and the cabinet its ornaments




<pb id="p.74" n="74"/>

 of fruit and foliage, its efflorescence
in metal or precious stone; some, their
figures of men, beasts, and birds; and all,
more or less, their colours, proportions, and
uses.
  </p><p>Shall we not then observe, and, as much
as possible, spiritualize them accordingly,
giving them the grace and beauty which
Nature suggests, and so rendering them
assistants of our best perceptions against our
worst? For effeminacy, the danger of delight, is not a consequence of enjoyments
founded in truth and in the spirit of things,
but of grovellings in the false and the gross;
not a consequence, therefore, of good art,
but of bad; of art lulling to sleep on the
chair for the mere body's sake, and not of
art awakening us to intellectual perceptions,
and thus dividing the empire of body with
that of mind.

 </p><p>Luther was not the less prepared to hazard
martyrdom, because he was a player on the
organ.  Socrates was not the less an actual
martyr, and one of the greatest of men,
because he had been a sculptor, and wrought
figures of the Graces.
 </p><p>All good things, as well as all bad things,
hold together; truth, strength, right perceptions in art; falsehood, weakness, bad
taste.  Truth, in any one respect, is good
for truth in other respects; and it would
be ridiculous to avoid cultivating anything
which is right, for fear of its degenerating
into what is wrong. Upon this principle, we
might discommend the teaching of virtue
itself, lest it turn sour, and become austerity
or hypocrisy. Our duty is to do our best,
and leave the rest to Providence.
 </p><p>The collection at Gore House, besides
tapestry, mirrors, and a few other things,












<pb id="p.76" n="76"/>

consists of cabinet work in oak, walnut, ebony,
&amp;c., carved, sculptured, inlaid, sometimes
with pictures, oftener in the Buhl style of
ornamentation; in short, presenting all the
reigning styles of treatment from the latter
part of the fifteenth century to the close of
the' eighteenth. There are cabinets, coffers,
commodes, buffets, chairs, tables, clocks,
drawers, presses, couches, flower-stands, firescreens, and even pairs of bellows.   The
rooms, in fact, are not big enough to hold
them; so that the visitors are crowded; and
as the materials are chiefly dark and ponderous, the general effect, notwithstanding
occasional gorgeousness, is heavy, and even
somewhat gloomy.
  </p><p>You might imagine that the fortunes of
half-a-dozen ancient houses had been suddenly ruined, and their goods and chattels
despatched in haste to an auctioneer's, to be


        <pb id="p.77" n="77"/>

sold. Better justice would have been done
to the individual objects, had there been space
enough to show them; for all productions
of art have so much to do with proportion,
that the proportions even of the spaces round
about them become of importance to their
display. Perhaps, however, it was not easy
to refuse offers from contributors; variety,
too, was a temptation; and a liberal abundance is welcome, after all, even at the expense of inconvenience.
 </p><p>The Government Commissioners, with
great judgment, have drawn attention to
these curiosities, not as models for indiscriminate imitation, but as illustrations of
the taste of successive periods; as samples
of merit on particular points, especially ornamentation; and in several instances, as warnings against inconsistencies and bad taste.
Foreigners, they say, can teach the English






<pb id="p.78" n="78"/>

workman nothing in point of mechanical
fitness and completion, but he may learn
much from them in the art of decoration.
This, no doubt, is true; and we hope
and believe that foreigners and nations will
benefit one another by these exhibitions; the
Englishman learning to make his cabinets
elegant, and the Frenchman and Italian to
make their keys turn smartly, and their
drawers come forth without sticking.
 </p><p>We cannot greatly admire such things as
Buhlwork; elaborations of brass ornaments
upon dark grounds. We prefer the inlayment of paintings, the additions of bas-reliefs,
and the quaintest old carvings of human
figures, fruits, &amp;c., provided they have any
truth of expression. Buhl is no company-
has nothing to entertain us with, but its
unnecessary flourishes.
  </p><p>Gilding is something, for it is a kind of




        <pb id="p.79" n="79"/>

sunshine. The jumble called rococo is, in
general, detestable. A parrot seems to have
invented the word; and the thing is worthy
of his tawdriness and his incoherence. We
confess, however, to a sneaking kindness
for the shepherds and shepherdesses of the
times of the Pompadours and the Madame
du Barrys. They were the endeavour of no-feeling to get at some feeling; to " assume a
virtue if they had it not ;" to play at lovers,
though they could only be gallants; nay, let
us do our best for them, and say, it was the
endeavour to conciliate the remnant of truth
and simplicity lurking in their hearts, and to
persuade themselves what a golden-age kind
of people they were intended by nature to
have been, provided only they could have had
their own way, and luxurious suppers instead
of bread and cheese.
  </p><p>Many of these extraordinary pieces of furniture










<pb id="p.80" n="80"/>

 are, nevertheless, excellent of their
kind, those in the rococo style not excepted.
There are cabinets and coffers truly worthy of
holding treasure; tables, at which it would
be an elevation of mind, as well as body,
to sit; clocks, that symbolize the value of
time (and not seldom its heaviness) by the
multiplicity and weight of their ornamentation; and chairs, which sometimes render
the request "not to touch," provoking; for
how otherwise are we to test the smoothness
of the " Genoa velvet ;" to taste the pleasure
of sitting, as sovereigns and beauties sate; or
comfortably to contemplate the very objects
before us, considering that there are no seats
in the rooms for visitors, and that pleasure
itself is fatiguing ?
 </p><p>Some interesting memories, also, are
attached to these costly moveables.  There is
a magnificent writing table, ostentatiously




      <pb id="p.81" n="81"/>

recording some of the projects of the famous
busy-body, Beaumarchais, author of the
comedy of "Figaro ;" a Buhl writing-table,
that belonged to the De Retz family; a
grand cabinet in pietra dura (precious stones),
made expressly for Louis the Fourteenth; a
carved Venetian coffer, that was the property
of the first Earl of Dorset, the poet, the
worthy precursor of Spenser; and another
Venetian coffer, adorned in wonderful alto
relievo with the story of Caesar crossing
the Rubicon, most life-like and masterly.
The work is dated in the catalogue " about
<date value="1560">1560</date>;" and the arms on the escutcheon (a
lion rampant and a head in a cap) are stated
to be "unknown."      We know     not the
arms of Caesar Borgia, otherwise the story
is just like one of the allusions of that
energetic miscreant.  Or, might it have
illustrated some lawless exploits of the











<pb id="p.82" n="82"/>

Malatesta family, one of the most ferocious
of whom was a great patron of art ?
  </p><p>We have    indulged  ourselves at such
length in these passing notices of art and
manufacture, that we must dismiss, with a
somewhat unpatriotic brevity, the other part
of the Exhibition-the copies from originals
and from Nature sent in by students of the
various Government Schools of Art, established throughout the kingdom. Indeed, we
could take no very long view of them, and
therefore must not be understood as throwing any slur upon those on which we are
silent, when we say that we were most struck
with the "Flamingo" of Miss Olden (No.
10); the "Madre Dolorosa," (from    Carlo
Dolce ?) by Miss Gunthorp (No. 24); the
"Magdalen," from Correggio, by Mr. Bowen
(No. 27); the  "Money-getter," (we know
not from whom) by Mr. Collinson (No. 32);




          <pb id="p.83" n="83"/>

"Fruit,"  by Mr. Gibson   (No. 47); the
"Study of Ornament in Colour," by Mr.
Ellison (No. 101); and those after "Cuyp
and Crivelli" (each wrongly referred), by
Mr. Armytage.   The "Flamingo" is admirably coloured, only we wish he looked less
like an ogre, with that long beak of his,
holding the eel.  It is all true to nature,
no doubt; but why need ornithological
painters select only those moments ?  The
" Madre Dolorosa"   is very dolorous, and
well done; but we have little faith in the
permanent dolour of those cheeks.   This,
however, is the original's fault, and not the
copyist's.  For the real, natural grief, the
amiable, surprised, and patient regret, in
the face of Corregio's "Magdalen," we are
most thankful, because we feel certain that
it brings the original before us; which cannot
be said of a late beautiful engraving of the






<pb id="p.84" n="84"/>
subject, very lovely, but not at all sorrowful.
The " Fruit" is partly bruised with its own
ripeness, very true and  beautiful.  The
" Ornament in Colour " is truly graceful and
consistent; hangs charmingly together; and
the "Cuyp and Crivelli" carry with them
their testimony to the fidelity of the copies.
These works are all up-stairs; chiefly, we
believe, in the garrets.  They look as if
a parcel of artists had fallen in love with the
maid-servants, and hung their dormitories
with evidences of their homage.
   </p><p>Little need be said of the grounds belonging to Gore House. Turf and trees are
good things, with or without flowers; and
the grounds are of unexpected dimensions,
considered as appurtenances to a suburban
residence; but, as Johnson said of a dinner,
that it was a good enough dinner, but " not
a dinner to invite a man to," so it may be



           <pb id="p.85" n="85"/>

said of the Gore House grounds, that they
hardly sustain the dignified announcement
of being  "thrown  open to the public;"
especially as this "throwing open" is confined to the visitors who have paid their way
to the cabinet-work.  You must think of
the late fair possessor, Lady Blessington,
to give an interest to their pathways.</p>

 <p>THE estates purchased by the Commissioners for the site and grounds of the new
National Gallery include those just described,
which consist of about twenty acres; and
it will, probably, when all the purchases are
completed, approach   to  a hundred.    It
widens as it goes south, and reaches to
Old Brompton.


        <pb id="p.87" n="87"/>

</p><p>From this point to the town of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> we pass houses both old and new,
some in rows, and some by themselves,
enclosed in gardens. They are all more
or less good; and the turnings out of
them lead into a considerable district, which
has lately been converted from nursery and
garden-ground into more streets, and is
called <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> New  Town.    It is all
very clean and neat, and astonishes visitors
who a few years ago beheld scarcely a house
on the spot. A pleasant hedge-lane, paved
in the middle, and looking towards the
wooded grounds of Gloucester Lodge, where
Canning lived, leads out of it into Old
Brompton.    One street, which   has no
thoroughfare, is quite of a stately character,
though deformed at the corner with one
of those unmeaning rounded towers, whose
tops look like pepper-boxes, or "Trifles from











<pb id="p.88" n="88"/>

Margate." The smaller streets also partake
of those improvements, both external and
internal, which have succeeded to the unambitious, barrack-like streets of a former
generation; nor in acquiring solidity, have
they, for the most part, been rendered heavy
and dumpy; the too common fault of new
buildings in the suburbs. It is ridiculous
to see lumpish stone balconies constructed
for the exhibition of a few flower-pots; and
doors, and flights of steps, big enough for
houses of three stories, put to "cottages"
of one. Sometimes, in these dwarf suburban
grandiosities, the steps look as weighty as
half the building; sometimes the door alone
reaches from the ground to the story above
it; so that " cottages " look as if they were
inhabited by giants, and the doorways as if
they had been maximized, on purpose to
enable them to go in.

 </p><p>This <placeName key="Kensington New Town">Kensington New Town</placeName> lies chiefly
between the Gloucester and Victoria Roads.
Returning out of the latter into the high
road, we pass the remainder of the buildings
above noticed, and, just before entering
<placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> itself, halt at an old mansion,
remarkable for its shallowness compared
with its width, and attracting the attention
by the fresh look of its red and pointed
brick-work.  It is called <placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName>,
and surpasses Gore House in the varieties
of its history; for it has been, first, the
habitation of a king's mistress; then a school
kept by an honest pedant, whom Johnson
visited; then a French emigrant school,
which had noblemen among its teachers,
and in which the late Mr. Sheil was brought
up; then a Roman Catholic boarding-house,
with Mrs. Inchbald for an inmate; and now
it is an "asylum," a term into which that











<pb id="p.90" n="90"/>

consideration for the feelings which so
honourably marks the progress of the present
day, has converted the plain-spoken " madhouse " of our ancestors.
 </p><p>The king's mistress was the once famous
Duchess of Portsmouth, a Frenchwoman,-
Louise de Querouaille-who first came to
England in the train of Henrietta, Duchess
of Orleans, the sister of Charles the Second.
She returned; and remained, for the express
purpose (it is said) of completing the impression she had made on Charles, and assisting
the designs of Louis the Fourteenth and the
Jesuits in making him a papist, and reducing
him to the treasonable condition of a pensioner on the French Court. Traitor and
pensioner, at all events, his Majesty became,
and the French woman became an English
Duchess; but whether she was a party to the
plot, or simply its unconscious instrument,




      <pb id="p.91" n="91"/>

she has hardly had justice done to her, we
think, by the historians.  She appears to
have been a somewhat silly person (Evelyn
says she had a "baby face"); she was bred
in <placeName key="France">France</placeName> at a time when it was a kind of
sacred fashion to admire the mistresses of
Louis the Fourteenth, and think them privileged concubines; she had probably learnt,
in the convent where she was brought up,
that lawless things might become lawful,
to serve religious ends; and she was visited
during her elevation by her own parents-straightforward, unaffected people, according
to Evelyn-the father a "good fellow,"
who seems at once to have rejoiced in
her position, and yet to have sought no
advantages from  it.  The Duchess, it is
true, ultimately got as much for herself as
she could, out of the King.  She was as
lavish as he was; became poor, a gambler,






<pb id="p.92" n="92"/>
and a gourmande; that is to say, gave
way to every innocent propensity, as she
might have thought it, which came across
her; and as her occupation of the house
at <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> appears to have been
subsequent to the reign of Charles, it probably
took place on one of her visits to England
during the reigns of William the Third
and George the First; on which latter
occasion she is supposed to have endeavoured to
get a pension from the English government
-on what grounds it would be curious
to know.   But the "baby-face" probably
thought it all right. We take her to have
been a thoroughly conventional, commonplace person, with no notions of propriety
but such as were received at Court, and
quite satisfied with everything, here and
hereafter, as long as she had plenty to eat,
drink, and play at cards with, and a confessor




             <pb id="p.93" n="93"/>
 to make all smooth, in case of
collateral peccadilloes. <note place="foot" n="1">Our countrymen, who hated the Duchess because she
was a Frenchwoman (and with reason, considering what
was thought to be her mission) converted her name,
Querouaille, into Carwell; which was nearer perhaps the
French word than they fancied; for Brittany, her native
province, received a portion of its inhabitants from Cornwall, where Car and Huel are component words; and it
still presents names of places and persons, corresponding
with Cornish appellations. Among them is (or was, in
the time of Madame de Sevigne) a family of the name of
Cornouailles; which was sometimes written Cornuel, and
is the way in which they spell the name of the English
county.</note>The jumble of things
religious and profane was carried to such
a height in those days, that a picture
representing the Duchess and her son (the
infant Duke of Richmond) in the characters
of  "Virgin    and  Child,"   was painted    for
a convent in <placeName key="France">France</placeName>, and actually used
as an altar-piece. They thought her an instrument


<pb id="p.94" n="94"/>

 in the hands of God for the restoration of Popery.
 </p><p>Adieu to the " baby-face," looking out of
the windows at <placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName>, in hope
of some money from King George; and hail
to that of the good old pedagogue, James
Elphinstone, reformer of spelling, translator
of "Martial," and friend of Dr. Johnson.
He is peering up the road, to see if his
great friend is looming in the distance;
for dinner is ready, and he is afraid
that the   veal  stuffed with  plums  (a
favourite dish of the Doctor's) will be
spoilt.
 </p><p>Mr. Elphinstone prospered in his school,
but failed in his reformation of spelling,
which was on the phonetic principle (one
of his books on the subject was entitled
" Propriety's  Pocket  Dictionary"),  and
he made such a translation of "Martial,"



      <pb id="p.95" n="95"/>

that his friend Strahan, the printer-but
the circumstance must be told out of
Boswell.
 </p><p>GARRICK. "Of all the translations that
ever were attempted, I think Elphinstone's
'Martial' the most extraordinary. He consulted me upon it, who am a little bit of
an epigrammatist, myself, you know. I told
him freely, 'you don't seem to have that
turn.' I asked him if he was serious; and
finding he was, I advised him against publishing. Why, his translation is more difficult
to understand than the original.  I thought
him a man of some talents; but he seems
crazy in this."
  </p><p>JOHNSON. "Sir, you have done what I
had not courage to do.    But he did not
ask my advice, and I did not force it upon
him, to make him angry with me."
  </p><p>GARRICK. " But as a friend, Sir."











<pb id="p.96" n="96"/>

 </p><p>JOHNSON.   "Why, such a friend as I
am with him-no."
 </p><p> GARRICK.   " But if you see a friend
going to tumble over a precipice ?"
 </p><p>JOHNSON. "That is an extravagant case,
Sir. You are sure a friend will thank you
for hindering him from tumbling over a
precipice; but, in the other case, I should
hurt his vanity, and do him no good. He
would not take my advice. His brother-in-law, Strahan, sent him a subscription of
fifty pounds, and said he would send him
fifty more, if he would not publish."
 </p><p>GARRICK.   " What, eh! is Strahan a
good judge of an epigram?    Is he not
rather an obtuse man, eh ?"
 </p><p>JOHNSON.   "Why, Sir, he may not be a
judge of an epigram; but you see he is a
judge of what is not an epigram."

token of the coming "Martial."      Johnson,
Jortin (of whom more hereafter), and, we

on me," says Boswell, "with Mrs. Williams,

 </p><p>The book   that was "much admired,"
was probably one that differed with Boswell

biographer, who is full of shabby suppressions
of this kind, might have added the title, or
not have mentioned the work at all.
  </p><p>It is said in Faulkner's "History of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>,"
  that Elphinstone was "ludicrously
characterized in Smollett's 'Roderick Randon,'

Jesuits, an account so entertaining has been
left by Mr. Shell in the Memoirs prefixed to
the volume of his Speeches, that, although it
is somewhat long, the reader, we are sure,
will be glad to have the whole of it, especially as it does not seem to be generally
known, and the regrets of the world are

     <pb id="p.103" n="103"/>

yet fresh at the loss of that distinguished
orator and member of parliament.
</p><p> How the smile of the French Abb&#x00E9;,
" made up of guile and meekness," could
deserve to be called "amiable, in the best
sense of the word," we cannot say.    But
nothing can surpass the descriptions of the
rest of the little man, glossy all over with
his black silk habiliments; of the emigrant
school-boys rejoicing in the victories obtained by the country which had rejected
them, at the expense of that which had
given them shelter; and of poor unteachable Charles the Tenth, thrilling at the
names of the little boys introduced to
him, and not foreseeing that he would
have to thrill at them over again, after repossessing the throne of <placeName key="France">France</placeName> to no
purpose.
 </p><p>"I landed at Bristol," says Mr. Sheil,



<pb id="p.104" n="104"/>

recording his first coming from <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName>,
"and with a French clergyman, the Abb&#x00E9;
de Grimeau, who had been my tutor, I proceeded to London. The Abb&#x00E9; informed me,
that I was to be sent to <placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName>,
a college established by the Peres de la Foi,
for so the French Jesuits settled in England
at that time call themselves; and that he
had directions to leave me there upon his
way to Languedoc, from whence he had
been exiled in the Revolution, and to which
he had been driven by the maladie de pays
to return. Accordingly, he set off for <placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName>, which is situated exactly
opposite the avenue leading to the Palace,
and has the beautiful garden attached to it
in front. A large iron gate, wrought into
rusty flowers, and other fantastic forms,
showed that the Jesuit school had once
been the residence of some person of distinction;

        <pb id="p.105" n="105"/>

 and I afterwards understood, that a
mistress of Charles the Second lived in the
spot which was now converted into one
of the sanctuaries of Ignatius. It was a
large, old fashioned house, with many remains of decayed splendour.  In a beautiful
walk of trees, which ran down from the rear
of the building, through the play-ground, I
saw several French boys playing at swing-swang; and the moment I entered, my ears
were filled with the shrill vociferations of
some hundreds of little emigrants, who were
engaged in their various amusements, and
babbled, screamed, laughed, and shouted,
in all the velocity of their rapid and
joyous language. I did not hear a word of
English, and at once perceived that I was
as much amongst Frenchmen as if I had
been suddenly transferred to a Parisian
college.  Having got this peep at the gaiety






<pb id="p.106" n="106"/>
of the school, into which I was to be introduced, I was led with my companion to a
chamber covered with faded gilding, and
which had once been richly tapestried; where
I found the head of the establishment, in the
person of a French nobleman, Monsieur le
Prince de Broglie. Young as I was, I could
not help being struck at once with the contrast which was presented between the occupations of this gentleman and his name. I
saw in him a little, slender, and gracefully-constructed Abbe with a sloping forehead, on
which the few hairs that were left him,
were nicely  arranged, and well-powdered
and pomatumed. He had a gentle smile,
full of a suavity which was made up of
guile and of weakness, but which deserved
the designation of amiable, in the best
sense of the word. His clothes were adapted
with a peculiar nicety to his symmetrical



         <pb id="p.107" n="107"/>

person; and his silk waistcoat and black
stockings, with his small shoes buckled with
silver, gave him altogether a glossy aspect.
This was the son of the celebrated Marshal
Broglie, who was now the head of a school,
and notwithstanding his humble pursuits,
was designated by everybody as ' Monsieur
le Prince.'
 </p><p>" Monsieur le Prince had all the manners
and attitudes of the Court, and by his
demeanour put me at once in mind of the
old regime. He welcomed my French companion with tenderness, and having heard
that he was about to return to <placeName key="France">France</placeName>, the
poor gentleman exclaimed, "Helas !" while
the tears came into his eyes at the recollection
of "cette belle <placeName key="France">France</placeName>," which he was
never, as he thought, to see again.  He
bade me welcome. These preliminaries of
introduction having been gone through, my





<pb id="p.108" n="108"/>

French tutor took his farewell; and as he
embraced me for the last time, I well remember that he was deeply affected by the
sorrow which I felt in my separation from
him, and turning to Monsieur le Prince,
recommended me to his care with an
emphatic tenderness.   The latter led me
into the school-room, where I had a desk
assigned to me beside the son of the Count
Decar, who has since, I understand, risen to
offices of very high rank in the French Court.
His father belonged to the nobility of the
first class. In the son, it would have been,
at that time, difficult to detect his patrician
derivation. He was a huge, lubberly fellow,
with thick matted hair, which he never
combed.   His complexion was greasy and
sudorific, and to soap and water he seemed
to have such a repugnance, that he did not,
above once a week, go through any process


       <pb id="p.109" n="109"/>

of ablution. He was surly, dogged, and silent,
and spent his time in the study of mathematics, for which he had a good deal of
talent.  I have heard that he is now one
of the most fashionable and accomplished
men about the Court, and that this Gorgonius smells now of the pastiles of Rufillus.
</p><p> " On the other side of me was a young
French West Indian, from   the colony of
Martinique, whose name was Devarieux.
The school was full of the children of the
French planters, who had been sent over to
learn English among the refugees from the
revolution.  He was an exceedingly fine
young fellow, the exact reverse in all his
habits to Monsieur le Comte Decar on my

hours of study in surveying a small pocket-mirror, and in arranging the curls of his
rich black hair, the ambrosial plenty of

which was festooned about his temples, and
fell profusely behind his head.
</p><p> "Almost all the French West Indians
were vain, foppish, generous, brave, and
passionate.  They exhibited many of the
qualities which we ascribe to the natives
of our own islands in the American Archipelago; they were a sort of Gallican Belcours
in little; for with the national attributes of
their forefathers, they united much of that
vehemence and habit of domination, which
a hot sun and West India overseership are
calculated to  produce.  In  general, the
children  of  the  French   exiles  amalgamated readily with these Creoles: there
were, to be sure, some points of substantial
difference; the French West Indians being
all rich roturiers, and the little emigrants
having their veins full of the best blood of
<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, without a groat in their pockets.

      <pb id="P.111" n="111"/>

But there was one point of reconciliation
between them-they all concurred in hating
England and its government.    This detestation was not very surprising in the
West Indian French; but it was not a little
singular, that the boys, whose fathers had
been expelled from <placeName key="France">France</placeName> by the revolution,
and to whom England had afforded shelter,
and given bread, should manifest the ancient
national antipathy, as strongly as if they had
never been nursed at her bosom, and obtained
their aliment from her bosom.
 </p><p>" Whenever news arrived of a victory won
by Bonaparte, the whole school was thrown
into a ferment; and I cannot, even at this
distance of time, forget the exultation with
which the sons of the decapitated, or the
exile, hailed the triumph of the French
arms, the humiliation of England, and
the glory of the nation whose greatness











<pb id="p.112" n="112"/>
they had learned to lisp.  There was one
boy I recollect more especially. I do not
now remember his name, but his face and
figure I cannot dismiss from my remembrance. He was a little effeminate creature,
with a countenance that seemed to have
been compounded of the materials with
which waxen babies are made; his fine
flaxen hair fell in girlish ringlets about
his face, and the exquisite symmetry of his
features would have rendered him a fit
model for a sculptor, who wished to throw
the beau ideal of pretty boyhood into
stone.  He had upon him     a sickly expression, which was not sufficiently pronounced to excite any disagreeable emotions but cast over him a mournful look, which
was seconded by the calamities of his
family, and added to the lustre of misfortune which attended him. He was the


        <pb id="p.113" n="113"/>

child of a nobleman who had perished in
the  revolution.  His mother, a widow,
who resided in a miserable lodging in
London, had sent him to <placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName>,
but it was well known that he was received
there by the Prince de Broglie from charity;
and I should add, that his eleemosynary
dependance, so far from exciting towards
him any of that pity which is akin to contempt, contributed to augment the feeling
of sympathy which the disasters of his
family had created in his regard. This unfortunate little boy was a Frenchman to his
heart's core, and whenever the country which
was wet with his father's blood had added
a new conquest to her possessions, or put
Austria or Prussia to flight, his pale cheek
used to flush into a hectic of exultation, and
he would break into joyfulness at the achievements by which <placeName key="France">France</placeName> was exalted, and the





<pb id="p.114" n="114"/>

pride and power of England were brought
down.   This feeling, which was conspicuous
in this little fellow, ran through the whole
body of Frenchmen, who afforded very unequivocal proof of the sentiments by which
their parents were influenced. The latter I
used occasionally to see. Old gentlemen, the
neatness of whose attire was accompanied
by indications of indigence, used occasionally
to visit at <placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName>.  Their elasticity of back, the frequency and gracefulness of their wellregulated bows, and the
perpetual smile upon their wrinkled  and
emaciated faces, showed that they had something to do with the "vieille cour," and this
conjecture used to be confirmed by the embrace
with which they folded the little marquises
and counts whom they came to visit.
  </p><p>"<placeName key="Kensington House">Kensington House</placeName> was frequented by
emigrants of very high rank.  The father


        <pb id="p.115" n="115"/>

of the present Duke de Grammont, who
was at this school, and was then Duke de
Guiche, often came to see his son. I
recollect upon one occasion having been witness
to a very remarkable scene.  Monsieur, as
he was then called, the present King of
<placeName key="France">France</placeName>, waited one day, with a large retinue
of French nobility, upon the Prince de
Broglie.  The whole body of the school-boys was assembled to receive him.   We
were gathered in a circle at the bottom of a
flight of stone stairs, that led from the principal room into the play-ground. The future
King of <placeName key="France">France</placeName> appeared with his cortege
of illustrious exiles, at the glass folding-doors which were at the top of the stairs,
and the moment he was seen, we all exclaimed, with a shrill shout of beardless
loyalty, 'Vive le Roi!' Monsieur seemed
greatly gratified by this spectacle, and in





<pb id="p.116" n="116"/>
a very gracious and condescending manner,
went down amongst the little boys, who
were at first awed a good deal by his
presence, but were afterwards speedily
familiarized to him by the natural benignity of
Charles the Tenth.  He asked the names
of those who were about him, and when
he heard them, and saw in the boys by
whom he was encompassed, the descendants
of some of the noblest families of <placeName key="France">France</placeName>,
he seemed to be sensibly affected.  One or
two names, which were associated with peculiarly melancholy recollections, made him
thrill. 'Helas ! mon enfant!' he used to
say, as some orphan was brought up to
him; and he would then lean down to
caress the child of a friend, who had perished
on the scaffolds of the Revolution."<note place="foot" n="1">The Speeches of the Right Honourable Richard Lalor Sheil, M.P., with a Memoir, &amp;c."  Edited by

 </p><p>While these extracts of ours respecting
the schoolmaster and schoolfellows of Mr.
Sheil have been going through the press, we
have had the pleasure of seeing a piece of
biography make its appearance, at once
loving and candid, which enables us to add
to them a highly characteristic portrait, in
his school-days, of the distinguished
Irishman himself.     It was furnished    to the
author by a learned judge, (Mr. Justice Ball,)
who had been one of his schoolfellows. " His
first appearance (he says) I recollect well;
it was strikingly grotesque.  His face was
pale and meagre; his limbs lank; his hair






<pb id="p.118" n="118"/>

starting upwards from his head like a brush;
a sort of muscular action pervading his whole
frame; his dress foreign; his talk broken
English, and his voice a squeak. Add to
this a pair of singularly brilliant eyes,
lighting up all the peculiarities of his figure, and
you have before you the boy Sheil.    His
performances were at first as singular as his
person. His efforts to kick a football were
sui generis. He never engaged in the game
along with the other boys, but kept aloof,
occupied in reading, or walking about the
playground; but whenever the ball was
thrown across his path, he used to dart at
it with a frantic energy, his legs and arms
all pretty equally on the stretch, so that it
was out of the question to determine with
what limb he would assail the ball, until
a kick at it probably from the left leg,
solved the problem; and then back he would

go to his reading, amid the yells of the urchins, enraged at his disturbing their game."<note place="foot" n="2"> "Memoirs of the Right Honourable Richard Lalor
Sheil. By W. Torrens M'Cullagh, author of the "
Industrial History of Free Nations," &amp;c. Vol.I., p. 23.</note>
 </p><p>For characters of the full-grown Sheil,
bodily and mental, who for the most part
was a rare and most interesting compound
of far-sighted judgment and immediate
impulse, we must refer to the work itself.
Sheil was not an unprosperous man; but he
ought to have been still more prosperous,
and lived to combine old age with a sort of
perennial youth; for such was the tendency
of his nature.
 </p><p>We know not how long the school of
the Abbe de Broglie lasted; but in the
year  <date value="1819">1819</date>, Kensington    House    was   a
Catholic boarding establishment, kept by
a Mr. and Mrs. Salterelli.




<pb id="p.120" n="120"/>

 </p><p>" In the chapel," says Boaden, in his
'Memoirs of Mrs. Inchbald,' "the Archbishop of Jerusalem performed mass regularly during the early part of his residence;
and the Abbe Mathias officiated, when the
Primate quitted the house. The society was
extremely genteel and cheerful, changing,
however, too frequently for perfect cordiality
and the formation of intimacy.  The Schiavonetti's, however, seem to be acquaintances;
and Mrs. Beloe, and Mr. Skeene from
Aberdeen, were old friends, who, on their
arrival, met with an unlooked-for pleasurethe celebrated artists, Mr. and Mrs. Cosway,
upon leaving Stratford Place, were at Kensington House from August to October,

handsome,   was   still  handsome,  was
growing fat, and  had   never  liked  to
part with her beauty. Who that is beautiful, does ?
 </p><p>"The health   of Mrs. Inchbald," says
her biographer, "was very indifferent this
year (<date value="1819">1819</date>); and her spirits sympathized
with her frame. In the month of March,
she was a good deal disturbed by the symptoms of a complaint, which intermitted,
but never entirely left her. After undressing
for bed, she felt a sensation of tightness
in her waist, which she naturally enough
attributed to the habit of drawing rather




<pb id="p.122" n="122"/>

too closely the strings of her under apparel."<note place="foot" n="4">P. 262.</note>
 </p><p>And   after her death, he   says: "As
we cannot speak professionally, we shall
only say, that it seems probable the tightness of which she formerly complained was
the indication of that malady (internal inflammation) which did not quit the frame,
though it remitted its attacks, and, latent,
awaited only the excitement of a cold
to render her recovery impracticable."<note place="foot" n="5">P. 275.</note>
 </p><p>We have dwelt a little on this point, as
a warning; if tight lacers can take warning.  We almost fear they would sooner
quote Mrs. Inchbald as an excuse than an
admonition.  But, at all events, beauties of
sixty-eight may, perhaps, consent to be a
little startled.
 </p><p>If this was a weakness in Mrs. Inchbald,


          <pb id="p.123" n="123"/>

let tight-lacers resemble her in other respects,
and if their rickety children can forgive
them, the rest of the world may very heartily
do so. Mrs. Inchbald never had any children,
to need their forgiveness.  She was a
woman of rare endowments: a beauty, a
dramatist, a novelist, a successful actress;
yet possessed of virtue so rare, that she
would practice painful self-denial, in order to
afford deeds of charity.  Her acting was,
perhaps, of the sensible, rather than artistical
sort; and though some of her plays and
farces have still their seasons of re-appearance
on the stage, she was too much given as a
dramatist to theatrical and sentimental effects
-too   melo-dramatic; but her novels are
admirable, particularly the 'Simple Story,'
which has all the elements of duration-invention, passion, and thorough truth to
nature in word and deed.   To balance the






<pb id="p.124" n="124"/>

advantages which she possessed over other
people, she must needs have had some
faults; and we take them (besides the
tight-lacing) to have been those of temper
and stubbornness.   Charles Lamb speaks
of her, somewhere, as the "beautiful vixen."
The word must surely have been too strong
for such a woman; who is said to have
possessed both the respect and affection of
all who knew  her.  If our memory does
not deceive us, he applies it to her upon an
occasion when she might well have been
angry, and when she thought herself bound
to resort to measures of self-defence, physical
as well as moral.   A  distinguished actor
who was enamoured of her, and who seems
to have been a warmer lover off the stage
than he was upon it, persisted one day in
forcing upon her salutations which appeared
so alarming, that the lady seized him by the

       <pb id="p.125" n="125"/>

pigtail, and tugged it with a vigour so
efficacious, as forced him to desist in trepidation.  She related the circumstance to a
friend, adding, with a touch of her comic
humour, which must have been heightened
by the difficulty of getting out the words
(for  she  stammered  sometimes),  " How
lucky  that  he   did  not w-w-wear   a
w-w-w-wig !"
 </p><p>Mrs. Inchbald lived in several other
houses in Kensington, which shall be noticed as we pass them; for the abodes

 <p>WE have now come to Kensington High
Street, and shall take our way on the lefthand side of it, continuing to do so through
the whole town, and noticing the streets
and squares that branch out of it as we
proceed.  We shall then turn at the end





           <pb id="p.127" n="127"/>

of the town, and come back by Holland
House, Campden House, and<placeName key=" Kensington
Palace"> Kensington
Palace</placeName> and Gardens.
 </p><p>On our right hand, over the way, is
the Palace Gate with its sentinels; and
opposite this gate, where we are halting, is
a sturdy, good-sized house, a sort of undergrown mansion, singularly so for its style of
building, and looking as if it must have
been the work of Vanbrugh, one of whose
edifices will be noticed further on.  It is
just in his "no nonsense" style; what his
opponents called "heavy;" but very sensible
and to the purpose; built for duration.
It is only one story high, and looks as if it
had been made for some rich old bachelor,
who chose to live alone, but liked to have
everything about him strong and safe.
 </p><p>Such was probably the case, for it is
called Colby House, after a baronet of that




           <pb id="p.129" n="129"/>

testate, and  left more than  &#x00A3;200,000 in

six day-labourers, who were his nearest relations."</p><p>

 </p><p> The <placeName key="High Street">High Street</placeName> of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, though
the place is so near London, and contains
so many new buildings, has a considerable
resemblance to that of a country town. This
is owing to the moderate size of the houses,
to their general style of building (which is
that of a century or two ago), and to the
curious, though not obvious, fact, that not
one of the fronts of them is exactly like
another.   It is also neat and clean;    its
abutment on a palace associates it with
something of an air of refinement; and
the first object that presents itself to the







<pb id="p.128" n="128"/>

name, who lived in the time of George the
First, and who appears to have been a man
of humble origin, and a miser. A spectator
of the house might imagine, that the architect was stopped, when about to commence
a third story, in order to save the expense.
Dr. King, the Jacobite divine, who knew
Colby, and who thinks he was a commissioner in the Victualling Office, says (in
his " Literary and Political Anecdotes of His
Own Times") that the baronet killed himself by rising in the middle of the night,
when he was in a profuse perspiration (the
consequence of a medicine taken to that
effect), and going down stairs for the key of
the cellar, which he had inadvertently left
on the table.  " He was apprehensive that
his servants might seize the key, and rob
him of a bottle of his port wine."
 </p><p> "This man," adds the Doctor " died inattention,











<pb id="p.130" n="130"/>

 next after the sentinels at the
Palace Gate, is a white and pretty lodge, at
the entrance of the new road leading to
Bayswater. The lodge, however, is somewhat too   narrow.   The road    is called
<placeName key=" Kensington Palace Gardens">Kensington Palace Gardens</placeName>, and is gradually filling with mansions, some of which
are in good taste and others in bad, and
none of them have gardens, to speak of;
so that the spectator does not well see why
anybody should live there, who can afford to
live in houses so large.
 </p><p>Pleasant, however, as the aspect of High
Street is on first entering it, the eye has
scarcely caught sight of the lodge just mentioned, when it encounters a sore in the
shape of some poor Irish people hanging
about, at the corner of the first turning on
the left hand. They look like people from
the old broken up establishment of Saint



            <pb id="p.131" n="131"/>

Giles's, and probably are so; a considerable
influx from the Rookery in that quarter
having augmented the Rookery in this, for
so it has alike been called. This Rookery
has long been a nuisance in <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>.  In
the morning you seldom see more of it
than this indication of its entrance; but in
the evening, the inmates mingle with the
rest of the inhabitants out of doors, and the
naked feet of children, and the ragged and
dissolute looks of men and women, present
a painful contrast to the general decency.
We understand, however, that some of these
poor people are very respectable of their
kind, and that the improvements which are
taking place in other portions of the
kingdom, in consequence of the attention so
nobly paid of late years to the destitute
and uneducated, have not been without effect
in this quarter.  The men for the most







<pb id="p.132" n="132"/>
part are, or profess to be, labouring bricklayers, and the women, market-garden
women. They are calculated, at a rough guess,
to amount to a thousand; all crammed,
perhaps, into a place which ought not to
contain above a hundred. The reader, from
late and painful statements on these subjects
knows how they must dwell. The place
is not much in sight. You give a glance,
and a guess at it, as you look down the
turning, and so pass on.  There was a talk,
not long since, of bringing the new road
just mentioned, from over the way, and
continuing it through the spot, so as to
sweep it clean of the infection, as in the
case of New Holborn and St. Giles's; and
in all probability the improvement will take
place; for one advance brings another, and
<placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> has become of late so much
handsomer as well as larger, that it will




      <pb id="p.133" n="133"/>

hardly leave this ugly blemish on its beauty.
But leases must expire, and lettings and
sub-lettings for poor people die hard.
 </p><p>Most of this unhappy multitude are
Roman   Catholics.  Their priests tell us
of a fine house at Loreto in <placeName key="Italy">Italy</placeName>, which
the Virgin Mary lived in at Nazareth, and
which angels brought from that place into
the dominions of the Pope. They also
tell us, that miracles never cease; at least,
not in Roman Catholic hands; and that
nobody feels for the poor as they do.
What a pity that they could not join these
feelings, these hands, and these miracles,
and pray a set of new houses into England
for the poor bricklayers !
 </p><p>Continuing our way from this
 inauspicious corner, we come to the turning at
Young Street, which leads into <placeName key="Kensington
Square">Kensington

  </p><p><placeName key="Kensington Square">Kensington Square</placeName> occupies an area of
some hundred and fifty feet, and was commenced in the reign of James the Second,
and finished towards the close of that of
William. It is now a place of obsolete-looking, though respectable houses, such as
seem made to become boarding-schools,
which some of them are; and you cannot
help thinking it has a desolate air, though
all its houses are inhabited.  In the reigns
of William, of Anne, and the first two
Georges, <placeName key="Kensington Square">Kensington Square</placeName> was the most
fashionable spot in the suburbs; it was
filled with frequenters of the Court, and
these are the identical homes which  they
inhabited.  Faulkner says, that "at one
time, upwards of forty carriages were kept
in and about the neighbourhood;" and




        <pb id="p.135" n="135"/>

that, "in the time of George the Second,
the demand for lodgings was so great,
that an   ambassador, a   bishop, and a
physician, were known to occupy
apartments in the same house.
  </p><p>The earliest distinguished name of an

her, after the good French fashion, taking
her evening walk in the Square, the envy
of surrounding petticoats, accompanied by
a set of English and French gallants,
Villierses, Godolphins, Ruvignys, &amp;c., among
whom is her daily visitor, and constant,
adoring old friend, Saint Evremond, with
his white locks, little skull cap, and the
great wen on his forehead. He idolizes her
to the very tips of her fingers, though





<pb id="p.136" n="136"/>

she borrowed his money, which he could ill
afford-and gambled it away besides, which
he could not but pray her not to do.  He
also begged her to resist the approaches of
usquebaugh.
 </p><p>The Duchess was then six and forty,

she had got a jealous, mean bigot for her

participation of the money which he obtained

with her. And as this was touching her on the tenderest point, she ran
away from him in pure desperation, to see
how she could enjoy herself elsewhere, and
what funds to pay for it she could get out
of him, by disclosing their quarrels to the
world.  The Duke (his name    was Meilleraye, but he took the name of Mazarin
when he married her) was inexorable, and
not to be scandalized out of his meanness;
so his wife, after divers wanderings, which
got her scandalized in her turn, came into

 </p><p><persName key=" Madame de Mazarin"> Madame de Mazarin</persName> has been so praised
by Saint Evremond for every kind of good
quality except prudence in money matters,
and occasional fits of ill-humour, that, with
all due allowance for the dotages to which
old men are subject, and for his particular
delight, as a French exile, in finding at
her house a female friend, and a society with
whom he could spend his evenings, it is not
easy to coincide with the general opinion,
which sets her down as a woman destitute of everything attractive, except her
beauty.  She probably understood his wit,
and enjoyed it to his heart's content; for
she appears to have had taste and reflection
enough to hold no mean part in conversation;











<pb id="p.140" n="140"/>
 and this would hinder her from falling
into the common mistake of beauties, and
thinking she could dispense with the wish
to please.  She used to intimate that her
friends would regret her when she was
gone; and St. Evremond appears heartily to
have done so, though she borrowed
hundreds out of his savings, and kept him in
constant  fright with  her  losses.  The
Duchess had been a spoilt child, and her
hand was bestowed on a foolish man.
When she was a girl, she tells us that she
and her sisters one day threw upwards of
three hundred louis out of window, for the
pleasure of seeing a parcel of footmen
scramble and fight for them. They must
have been louis d'ors, or so many pounds
sterling, a sum worth two or three times
the amount at present; she says, that the
amusement was thought to have hastened






         <pb id="p.141" n="141"/>

her uncle's death.  She was afterwards accused, while in a convent, where her husband had succeeded in " stowing" her for a
time, of putting ink into the holy-water box
(to smut the nun's faces,) and of frightening
them out of their sleep at night, by running through the dormitory with a parcel of
little dogs, yelping and howling. She says
that these stories were either inventions or
exaggerations; but we are strongly disposed
to believe them.   We mention the convent, because as such places are again subjects of conversation in this country, and
matters of concern to our families, it may
be useful to know what kind of scenes
they have witnessed, comic as well as
tragic.
 </p><p>But we must quit this glimpse of the
days of <persName key="Charles the Second">Charles the Second</persName>, for a personage who suggests a wholly different set




<pb id="p.142" n="142"/>
of ideas, his figure having been unwieldy,
and his dullness unfortunately no less conspicuous than his good   morals.   Here,
somewhere  about   the  south-west corner
of the Square, lived, for several years, physician to <persName key="King William the Third">King William the Third</persName>, and
butt of all the wits of the time, <persName key="Sir Richard
Blackmore.">Sir Richard
Blackmore.</persName> Johnson said they hated him
more for his morals than his dullness;
but though most of them were far from
being immaculate, it was not in the nature
of any of them  to hate a man for what
was good in him, much less of such persons
as Garth and Steele.   The truth is, that
Blackmore began the warfare by attacking
the wits; and as he wrote heaps of dull
poetry, it was not to be expected that they
should spare their assailant merely because
his clumsy blows were dealt as heavily as
he could bestow them, out of a good motive.


     <pb id="p.143" n="143"/>

They might even doubt the entire goodness
of motive in a man who understood his
qualifications in other respects so ill; and,
indeed, there seems to have been nothing
to show for the motive, except the blows;
for though Blackmore was, in all probability, what is called a respectable man, there
is no evidence of his having possessed
more than the average amount of virtue, or
any such particular experience or self-knowledge, as might supply the place of excellence. Some of the wits, too, who advocated
a milder form of Christianity than he did,
might have doubted the very piety of some
of his dogmas, and thus have been induced
to treat his arrogation of a right to lecture
them with double contempt; and none of
them, as critics, were bound to overlook
the presumption of a poetaster, who made
no scruple to denounce folly and ignorance











<pb id="p.144" n="144"/>

in others, and to trumpet forth his own
claims as a censor and a man of genius. The
"Creation"   is a favourable specimen of
Blackmore.    There is a   horrible facility
of mediocrity about it. But of his works
in general that condemned him, who now
shall judge ? for who possesses them ? Let
the reader take a couplet from the lines
quoted by Garth in his " Dispensary."

</p><p>Let us turn to a good old prelate,
Hough, Bishop of Winchester, who lived in
this square several years, and whom we mention for three reasons: first because, when
elected President of Magdalen College, Oxford, he had resisted, with equal temper
and firmness, the arbitrary conduct of <persName key="James
the Second">James

into his place; second, because he lived to
reach his ninety-third year, which we take to
be a merit in a bishop, considering the table
he is expected to keep, and the plethora
which  is pardoned  to episcopal virtues;
and third, because the habitual sweetness
of his disposition (and we consider the
least proof of such a habit to be no anti-climax in this enumeration) enabled him to
give dignity to a pun.

Wilmot, taking leave of him one day, and
making many awkward bows, ran against,
and threw down on the floor, a favourite
barometer of the   Bishop's.  The man
was frightened, and extremely concerned;
but the good old prelate, with all the
complacency possible, said to him, "Don't
be uneasy, Sir. I have observed this glass
almost daily for upwards of seventy years,
but I never saw it so low before."
  </p><p>It may seem, on reading this anecdote,
that, to render the Bishop's behaviour perfect,
the mention of the seventy years might
have been spared; but in so excellent a
man we must look upon it as a piece of
refined delicacy, enhancing the kindly nonchalance of the conclusion.
 </p><p>Two other prelates are mentioned as
having lived in <placeName key="Kensington Square">Kensington Square</placeName>, and all
three are worth recording.  The first was












<pb id="p.148" n="148"/>
Mawson, Bishop   of Ely, "awkward and
absent," and with " no desire to please," says
an equivocal panegyrist; meaning, in modern
parlance, no desire to curry favour; but a
man of princely munificence. He was the
son of a brewer at Chiswick;  founder, we
hope, of that orthodox drink, the "fine
Chiswick ale." Mawson did not live so long
as Hough, but he attained a very respectable longevity.  He died   in the   year
<date value="1770">1770</date>, at theage of eighty-eight. Perhaps
the Kensington air was of use to the good
bishops.
  </p><p>The other prelate was Herring, Bishop
of Bangor, afterwards Primate, and author of
some of the best letters in the "Elegant
Epistles."  He occupied the house at the
north-east corner of the square; but he
died at Croydon, in <date value="1757">1757</date>. Herring made a
mistake, when he attacked the Beggar's





       <pb id="p.149" n="149"/>

Opera; for which Swift gave him a tremendous rebuke. He had better have attacked
the morals of the great world, of which the
opera was a parody. But he probably outlived the misconception; for he was a man
of a genial nature, and had a true taste in
literature. It is curious, however, to see on
which side of the question lay worldly
prosperity.  Gay, who attacked the morals
of the great, and Swift, who defended the
attack, missed the preferments they looked
for; while Herring, who may have been
thought to defend the morals, became Archbishop of Canterbury.
 </p><p>Herring seemed born to be an archbishop.
He was grave yet insinuating, had a sweet
voice and a majestic appearance; "a countenance (as Sydney Smith says) expressive
of all the cardinal virtues and the Ten
Commandments." Strange are the vicissitudes











<pb id="p.150" n="150"/>
 of houses.  In this same abode of the
magnificent-looking prelate, lived, some fifty
years afterwards, a man with a club-foot, who
had also been a prelate, but had unfrocked
himself to become a statesman, and who,
instead of embodying   " all the  cardinal
virtues  and  the  Ten   Commandments,"
was  thought by most people to     have
violated every injunction in the Decalogue,
This was Talleyrand, a diplomatist under
every  government  in  <placeName key="France">France</placeName>, from   the
beginning of the Revolution to that of
Louis Philippe inclusive, with the exception
of the Reign of Terror.  We believe him,
nevertheless, to have been a very calumniated
person.  That he   had led the ordinary
life of a young French noble, under the
old regime, is very likely; and that he
had no taste for being a martyr, is equally
so.  It is easy also to palm upon a wit


             <pb id="p.151" n="151"/>

and man of the world every clever saying
that seems to tell against political honesty.
But, for the  most part, Talleyrand    did
good to the world under his different masters; hindered them from being worse; and
was for promoting constitutional government.
He lost Napoleon's favour by his tendencies
that way, and  by his protest against the
iniquitous seizure of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>.  The Emperor's
decline dates from the period of his differences with  Talleyrand.  While yet a
bishop, Talleyrand advocated the rights of
the working clergy; and he appears to

intercourse.  Let justice be  done  to the
club-foot that made the best, instead   of
the worst of things; not always the way
with injured members of society.  Perhaps
it will not be thought an anticlimax in this

 <p>RETURNING out of <placeName key="Kensington Square">Kensington Square</placeName>
by the way we entered it, we come, in the
most open part of the <placeName key="High Street">High Street</placeName>, to
the parish church and church-yard; the
former, a small and homely building for
so  distinguished  a  suburb;  the  latter






<pb id="p.154" n="154"/>

suggesting  a  doubt, whether   a burialground  ought to abut so    closely  on  a
public way.
  </p><p>In some moods of the mind, the juxtaposition is very painful.  It looks as if death
itself were no escape from the turmoils of
life. We feel as if the noise of carts and
cries were never to be out of one's hearing;
as if the tears, however hidden, of those
who stood mournfully looking at our graves,
were to be mocked by the passing crowd
of indifferent spectators; as if the  dead
might  be  sensible  of the very market
going on, with all its night-lights and
bustle (as it does here on Saturdays), and
of the noise of drunken husbands and wives,
persisting in bringing a sense of misery into
one's last home.
 </p><p>On the other hand, the sociable man
may  sometimes  be   disposed  to  regard




          <pb id="p.155" n="155"/>

with complacency this kind of posthumous
ntercourse with the living. He may feel
as if the dead were hardly the departed-as if they were still abiding  among their
friends and fellow-creatures, not displeased
even to hear the noise and the bustle; or,
at least, as if in ceasing to hear our voices
they were still, so to speak, reposing in our
arms.  Morning, somehow, in this view of
the case, would seem   to be still theirs
though they choose to lie in bed; cheerful
noon is with them, without their having any
of the trouble  of it.   The names may
be read on their tombstones as familiarly
as they used to be on their doors; children
play about their graves, unthinkingly indeed,
but joyously, and with as little thought of
irreverence as butterflies; and  the  good
fellow going home at night from his party
breathes a jovial, instead  of a  mournful






<pb id="p.156" n="156"/>

blessing on their memories.   Perhaps he
knew them.    Perhaps he has been joining
in one of their old favourite glees by
Callcott or Spofforth, the former of whom
was a Kensington man, and the latter of
whom lies buried here, and is recorded at
the church door.  And assuredly the dead
Spofforth would find no fault with his living
remembrancer.
 </p><p>In quiet country places there is, in fact,
a sort of compromise in this instance between
the two feelings of privacy and publicity,
which we have often thought very pleasing.
The dead in a small, sequestered village,
seem hardly removed from their own houses.
The last home seems almost a portion of the
first. The clergyman's house often has the
church-yard as close to it as the garden; and
when he goes into his grave, he seems but
removed into another room; gone to bed,



        <pb id="p.157" n="157"/>

and  to his sleep.   He has not "left."
He lies there with his family, still ready to
waken with them all, on the heavenly
morning.
 </p><p>This, however, is a feeling upon the
matter, which we find it difficult to realize in
a bustling town.  We are there convinced
upon the whole, that, whether near to houses
or away from them, the sense of quiet is
requisite to the proper idea of the church-yard.
The dead being actually severed from us,
no longer visible, no longer having voices,
all sights and sounds, but of the gentlest and
quietest kind, seem to be impertinences
towards them; not to belong to them.
Quiet, being the thing farthest removed
from cities, and what we imagine to pervade
all space, and the gulfs between the stars, is
requisite to make us feel that we are
standing on the threshold of heaven.







<pb id="p.158" n="158"/>

  </p><p>Upon the whole, therefore, we cannot
approve of church-yards in living thoroughfares, and thus must needs object to the one
in the place before us; though there are
portions of it to the north and west of the
church more sequestered (for a small remove
in these cases makes a great difference);
and in those portions the most noticeable
of the graves are situate.   They are not
many; nor have we much to say of persons
lying in the church itself, or in the church
vaults.  What notice   we have to    give,
whether in church or church-yard, we shall
put in chronological order, as not only being
most convenient, but having a certain mortal
propriety.
 </p><p>But first we must return to the church
itself. From what we have said of it, the
reader will conclude that it is remarkable, as
an edifice, for nothing but the smallness and





        <pb id="p.159" n="159"/>

homeliness of its appearance; but it has
this curious additional claim to consideration;
namely, that what with partial rebuildings,
and wholesale repairs, it has been altered,
since the year <date value="1683">1683</date>, nearly a dozen times.
How often before then, we cannot say; nor
do we know when it was first built. But
the alterations, for the most part, appear to
have been as bad as what they altered.
They beat the silk stocking, the repeated
mendings of which turned it into worsted.
They were always worsted, badly darned.
They resembled the scape-grace relation of
the famous Penn, whom his punning recorder
described as a pen that had been "often
cut, but  never  mended."   What were
improvements or requirements in some
respects, became defacements in others, or
things to be wished away.    The painted
window was meagre; the galleries clogged











<pb id="p.160" n="160"/>

up, a space already too little, and looked
as if they would slide into the pews;
the pews themselves were too tall, and aggravated that sense of closeness and crowding, to which the increasing population naturally tended, and which is still the first
thing that strikes a visitor of the church.
 </p><p>While writing this passage, however, (for
the church is now undergoing another
repair), we have the pleasure of observing
that the pews are in the act of being made
lower; and we hail this undoubted improvement, as an evidence of the better
taste which new authorities have brought
even into <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> parish church, and
which, indeed, was to be expected, from
what they have done in other respects.
We must add, that its psalmody appears
to have been for some time past superior
to that of most churches, owing, it would




       <pb id="p.161" n="161"/>

seem, to the accomplished family of the
Callcotts, who have long been residents of
the parish, and one of whom, no great
while ago, was organist. Nor should the
writer omit, that the parish authorities,
both clerical and laical, and their servants
also, do justice to the example at their
head, and are as courteous as becomes
their position.

and whatsoever other felonies and enormities

was a pardon from Richard, the poor little

a friend;  an  expectation which did not
hinder <persName key="Meautis, John ">John Meautis</persName>, or his son Philip
(we know not which) from becoming secretary to Kings Henry the Seventh and Eighth.
We notice the name for two other reasons
first, because it was that of Bacon's faithful
secretary, Sir Thomas Meautis, who raised





          <pb id="p.163" n="163"/>

 the characteristic statue to the philosopher,
 which sits thinking on his monument at
 St. Albans; second, to observe, that the
 alias, Meautis, or Meutice (the name being
 obviously  of French  origin) renders  it
 probable that there is more propriety in
 the vulgar pronunciation  of Bewfort for
 Beaufort, than  might otherwise be supposed, especially as we retain it in the word
 beauty, the English of beaute. There is
 reason to believe that it was the real old
 French pronunciation.  We have read in
 some  book, but forget where, that the
 existing mode of speaking French, which
 has so frittered and clipped it, and rendered
 its prosody such a puzzle to English readers,
 is not older than the time of Louis the
 Fourteenth.
</p><p>The next distinguished burial we meet
with, is that of one <persName key="Sir Manhood Penruddock">Sir Manhood Penruddock</persName>,





<pb id="p.164" n="164"/>

 a gentleman whose peremptory
baptismal name, joined to his chivalrous
rank, and to the nature of his death,
appears to insist on attention to his memory,
upon pain of a challenge from his ghost.
He was " slain at Notting Wood (saith the
parish register) in fight;" that is to say,
we take it, in a duel; for the " fight" was
in the year <date value="1608">1608</date>, during the pacific times
of King James the First.   Sir Manhood
was most likely some hot-headed Welshman,
the son of a corresponding father, who had
thus christened him, by way of injunction
to uphold the fame of his ancestors.
 </p><p>From Sir Manhood, we are borne over
a considerable interval of time, and brought
to Addison's Earl of Warwick, who died
in the year <date value="1721">1721</date>, at the age of four and
twenty.  He   was son of the Countess
whom Addison married, and was the youth




          <pb id="p.165" n="165"/>

to whom the moralist is said to have addressed the famous words, "See how a
Christian can die."  A statue of him, in
marble, and in good condition, is still remaining in the church, on the right hand
side of the principal entrance from the
street.  It sits under an epitaph, leaning
on an urn; and has an aspect, which, at
first sight, you hardly know whether to be
male or female. This is owing, partly to
the delicate smooth face and flowing hair,
and partly to the robe, which has something of the look of a lady's gown.  On
turning to the legs, and finding them in
ancient sandals, you discover that the gown
is a Roman toga. Either the face is unlike,
or the compliment to its manliness (strangely
paid in the first person-virile nescio quid)
is clearly undeserved. The whole epitaph,
indeed, is contradictory to the tradition






<pb id="p.166" n="166"/>
handed down respecting the rakery of this
young nobleman; probably on no better
foundation  than  Addison's dying  words,
which have been supposed to imply some
special moral necessity for them, on the
part of his hearer.  Writers complimented
the Earl on his virtues, while he was living;
and  Addison, in  some pleasant letters to
him, on the subject of birds, speaks of his
" more severe studies," and of their common
friend, Virgil. The probability is, that he
was of a delicate  constitution, and of a
lively enough mind, and that his attention
had been drawn to the writings of Shaftesbury and others, with   a vivacity which
Addison thought fit to repress.

of Tuscany.   The dramatic propensity  of
the family  appears to have    commenced
with this gentleman, who interested himself
in operatic affairs, and wrote the words of
Handel's "Ariadne in Naxos."   He was an
intimate friend of Gay
 </p><p>Dr. John   Jortin, in  the  year <date value="1770">1770</date>,
aged  71.    Author  of   the  " Life  of
Erasmus;"   an elegant scholar, critic, and
theologian.  He lies in the church-yard,
under a flat stone, which   is surrounded
with iron rails, and briefly inscribed with his
name, age, and the day on which he " ceased
to  be  mortal"  (mortalis esse    desiit).
Among the improvements which the authorities here are making, we trust we shall
see these good words rescued from the dirt
which has obscured them.
 </p><p>There were some curious inconsistencies
in Jortin.  He was a good-natured man,




<pb id="p.168" n="168"/>

with unattractive manners; was a writer
of elegant sermons, which he read very
badly; and was always intimating that he
ought to have had greater preferment in
the church; though he was suspected, not
unreasonably, of differing with it on some
points held essential to orthodoxy. His life
was written by Dr. Disney the Unitarian.
The doctor's book ought to have been more
amusing, considering that Jortin had the
reputation of being a wit. To the best of
our recollection, it contains but one solitary
jest, and that more pleasant than exquisite.
Jortin, when summoned to make his appearance in some public room, before the
bishop who gave him his vicarage, could not
find his hat.  On returning to his friends,
he said, "I have lost my hat, but got a
living."

off the habit of fault-finding, even in their

the  readers  of their   tomb-stones.    This
posthumous busy-body, who informs us that
his own head is quiet, seems determined
that the case shall be different with ours.
The following is his epitaph in the churchyard:</p><p>

<p>THE   <persName key="Madan, Reverend  Martin ">Reverend  Martin Madan</persName>,    <date value="1790">1790</date>,
aged   sixty-four.  His   mother  was  a
Cowper, and aunt of the poet. He made
himself conspicuous in his day, and very
unpopular with the religious world, by
writing a book called " Thelypthora" (Female
Ruin) in which, upon the strength of the




          <pb id="p.171" n="171"/>

Mosaic law, he recommended polygamy as
a remedy for seduction.  His arguments
were learned and acute, but accompanied
by so much bigotry, that in conjunction
with the usual repugnance of the community to touch upon one of the sorest
of social questions, they left him at the
mercy of opponents who might otherwise
have found  them  very  puzzling.  The
reader may judge the matter for himself
from the following anecdote, which Madan
relates in his book.
</p><p>  "On   conversing,"  he says, "with  a
gentleman who is a Jew on this subject,
he told me, that some time ago a rich young
Jew at Amsterdam seduced a poor Jewess
who was a servant-girl.  She insisted on
his publicly marrying her, which he refused.
She complained to the synagogue, who
summoned him to appear before them, that







<pb id="p.172" n="172"/>

they might enquire properly into the fact.
Finding it true, they sentenced him to marry
her publicly. He would not, urging the
difference of his rank from hers; but this
plea was not allowed; they urged the law
of God against him; but he continuing
obstinate in his refusal, they excommunicated
him.   He applied to some of the states of
Holland, that they would interfere; but
they refused it, saying the synagogue had a
right to enforce their own laws. I asked
the gentleman with whom I was conversing, what would have been the case, if
this young man had been before married
to another woman then living. He answered
'just the same; for, by the law of Moses no
man can take a virgin, and afterwards
abandon her at his pleasure.'"<note place="foot" n="1">Vol. II., p. 336.</note>






      <pb id="p.173" n="173"/>

 </p><p> The reader will see the difficulties of
the question, and this is not the place for
discussing it; though it is impossible for a
mind of any reflection not to be crossed
with a deep shade of regret at seeing how
constantly the far greater questions which
involve it, and which Mr. Madan was
incompetent even to discuss, are evaded
and put off by moral and statistical writers
who are otherwise conscientious men.

The elder of two celebrated physicians of
that name, father and son.   Dr. Warren
seems to have been a model of his class.
He was no formalist, but impressed and
interested his patients with the most sterling
qualities, both professional and personal,
and had the art (a very great and important
art in a physician) of entertaining them,
and  keeping up their spirits.  We   have
heard it said, on the best of all authorities
on such a point-that of an amiable and
intelligent woman-that the   "finest eyes
in the world " were hereditary in the
Warrens; so that, under all the circumstances, the reader will not wonder to be
told, that Mrs. Inchbald, who was one of




      <pb id="p.175" n="175"/>

his patients, was secretly in love with him,
and would pace <placeName key="Sackville Street">Sackville Street</placeName> after dark,
purely to have the pleasure of seeing the
light in his window. A pleasant answer is
recorded of him  to Lady Spencer.    Her
Ladyship questioned whether the minds of
physicians must not be frequently embittered
by the reflection, that a different mode of
treatment might have saved the lives of
their patients. Dr. Warren thought otherwise.
"The   balance  between  satisfaction  and
remorse, must," he considered, "be greatly
in favour of satisfaction," and, as an instance
of it, he hoped he should have the pleasure
of curing her Ladyship "forty times before
he killed her."
</p><p>  James Elphinstone, in <date value="1804">1804</date>, aged eighty-eight; the good Dominie before-mentioned;
translator of " Martial." The marble tablet
inscribed to his memory, on the outside of






<pb id="p.176" n="176"/>

the eastern wall, was set up by his wife;
which reminds us of an omission in our
notice of him; to wit, that, after his return
from a visit to <placeName key="France">France</placeName>, when a young man,
he never altered his dress.  It was a suit
of drab colour, with bag-wig and toupee, all
made according to the fashion which prevailed at the time. Latterly, however, he
more than once offered to make any change
in it "which Mrs. Elphinstone might deem
proper;" but the good lady's eyes had been
so accustomed to see her husband as he
was, that she could not bear the thought of
beholding him otherwise; or, to use the
more emphatic language of one of his pupils
(the late Mr. Dallas, the novelist), his virtues
and worth had so " sanctified his appearance
in her eyes, that she would have thought
the alteration a sacrilege."  It appears, also,
from accounts given us by the same gentleman,



       <pb id="p.177" n="177"/>

 that the worthy schoolmaster, to his
zeal for the purity of the English language,
added no less for that of the appearance
of the ladies.  For Mr. Dallas tells us,
that, when any " were in company whose
sleeves were at a distance from their elbows,
or whose bosoms were at all exposed, he
would fidget from place to place, look
askance with a slight convulsion of his left
eye, and never rest till he approached some
of them, and pointing to their arms, would
say, 'Oh! yes, indeed, it is very pretty;
but it betrays more fashion than modesty,'
or some such familiar phrase; after which
he became very    good-humoured."    One
fancies good Mrs. Elphinstone bridling up,
at these times, in the consciousness of her
own  well-covered charms; and approving
her husband, for thus combining his admiration of ladies' beauties in the abstract,











<pb id="p.178" n="178"/>
with objections to the fair challengers of it
in particular.
 </p><p>  But we shall forget the place of which
we are talking; though, indeed, to speak
of such deceased people as the Elphinstones,
is the next thing to looking at children
playing  over their graves.   Their smiles
excuse one's own.
</p><p>  The ensuing record on a stone in the
church-yard recalls all our gravity:

We mention both these names, for the
affecting reason, that they record a father
who died broken-hearted for the loss of
his child. He was a distinguished musical




      <pb id="p.179" n="179"/>

composer, and   wrote  operas that  were
favourites with the Bantis and Billingtons
of his day. It hardly need be added that
he was a most amiable and benevolent man.
What a death he must have died!    Three
years of wasting sorrow! Yet death thus
loses its sting; and in the last moments
there is the blissful hope of rejoining the
object  of  affection.  Those  are  great
payments of their kind; great privileges;
unable as the sufferer must be, till sure
of dying, to rejoice in their possession.
 </p><p> Elizabeth  Inchbald,  before mentioned,
<date value="1821">1821</date>. She lies at the western extremity
of the church-yard, close to a son of
Canning, the verses on whose tomb-stone

of conventional elegance.  They are not
unaffecting; for if nature speaks at all, she
must speak to some purpose, whatever be






<pb id="p.180" n="180"/>
her language; but, compared with it in
other respects, the plain prose tribute to
Mrs. Inchbald is characteristic of the
prevailing difference in the minds of the two
parties-that to   the  woman   being truth
itself, while the statesman's is truth after
a fashion; and the fashion addresses itself
to one's attention as much as the truth.

observing, in addition to our previous notice
of this lady, that although we have spoken
but of the latest and profoundest of her
two novels, the " Simple Story," the other,
"Nature and Art," is also full of genius,
and would alone have rendered the steps
of her pilgrimage in this life worthy the
tracing.  It is one of the earliest works
of fiction in this country, that sounded in
the ears of the prosperous the great modern
note of Justice to All. No reader, of the

made on him   by the trial of the poor girl,
whose crime was owing to the very judge

 </p><p> Reginald Spofforth, the glee-composer,
in  <date value="1827">1827</date>, aged  37.
There is a tablet
to his memory on the left-hand side on






<pb id="p.182" n="182"/>
the outer wall of the church, close by the
principal entrance. Bacon has compared the
fragrance of flowers out of doors to the
coming and going of the warbling of music.
The   crescendos  and   diminuendos   in
Spofforth's beautiful composition, " Health
to my dear," always remind us of that
charming simile. Musicians, for the most
part, are not as long-lived as painters, or
even as poets, though the latter are so
excitable a race. The reason is not, perhaps,
so much that the musical art is of the
more sensuous nature, as that musicians,
owing to the demands of their profession,
continue all their lives to go more into
company, and to keep   late hours.  The
painter (barring corporate jealousies) can
live as quiet as a hermit; and the poet,
from the habit of seeing so much in
everything that he looks upon, makes a

Mr. Mill persuaded himself, that a man who
had never been in <placeName key="India">India</placeName>, and who knew
none of its languages, was better qualified
to write a history of that country, than
one who had.     The consequence of this
paradox was, that after his death, the bookseller found it necessary to employ one of
the persons thus described as less competent,
for the purpose of correcting the mistakes
of  his  predecessor.   Nevertheless, Mr.
Mill's history was a work so remarkable
for its ability, that although he had found
great fault with the East India Company,
they, much to the credit of their feelings,




<pb id="p.184" n="184"/>
or their policy, appointed him to a
considerable office in their establishment. Would
to Heaven they had empowered him to
give the unfortunate millions under their

to their rice.

In the decline of life, he attained to a very

Dramatic Censor; that is to say, reviser,

years. We know not who the Charnleys
were; but we notice them, because their
grave, the only one in the churchyard so
distinguished, is adorned with flowers.  A
printed tablet requests people not to pluck
the flowers, and the request appears to be
attended to. Human kind are disposed to
be reasonable and feeling, if reasonable appeal
is made to them, and a chord in the heart
is touched.  The public cemeteries, which
we have imitated from the French, appear
to have brought back among us this inclination  to put flowers on graves.   The
custom has prevailed more or less in almost










<pb id="p.186" n="186"/>
all parts of the world, according as nations
and religions have been kindly.  It is the
Puritans who would seem to have done it
away in England and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>. Wales, we
believe, is the only part of the island in
which it has never been discontinued. The
custom is surely good and desirable.  It does
not follow that those who are slow to
resume it must be unfeeling, any more than
that those who are quick to do so, must of
necessity be otherwise. A variety of thoughts
on the subject of death itself may produce
different impressions in this respect on
different minds; but, generally speaking,
evidence is in favour of the flowers.  You
are sure that those who put them, think
of the dead somehow. Whatever motives
may be mixed up with it, the respectful
attention solicited towards the departed is
unequivocal;  and  this  circumstance  is



      <pb id="p.187" n="187"/>

pleasing to the living, and may benefit
their dispositions.  They think that their
own memories may probably be cherished
in like manner; and thoughtfulness is
awakened in them, towards living as well as
dead.  It is the peculiar privilege, too, of
flowers, to befit every place in which they
appear, and to contribute to it its best
associations.  We had  almost said, they
are incapable of being put to unworthy
use.  The contradiction would look simply
monstrous, and the flowers be pitied for
the insult.  No  butcher would think of
putting them in a slaughter-house; unless,
indeed, they  could  overpower its odour.
No inquisitor (we beg the butcher's pardon
for naming two such persons together) was
ever cruel or impudent enough to wreathe
flowers about a rack.  Flowers, besides being
beautiful themselves, are suggestive of every










<pb id="p.188" n="188"/>
other kind of beauty; of gentleness, of
youthfulness, of hope. They are evidences
of Nature's good-nature; proofs manifest
that she means us well, and more than
well; that she loves to give us the beautiful
in addition to the useful. They neutralize
bad with good; beautify good itself; make
life livelier; human bloom more blooming;
and anticipate the spring of Heaven over
the winter of the grave. Their very frailty,
and the shortness of their lives, please us,
because of this their indestructible association with beauty; for while they make
us regret our own like transitory existence,
they soothe us with a consciousness, however dim, of our power to perceive beauty;
therefore of our link with something divine
and deathless, and of our right to hope
that immortal thoughts will have immortal
realization.  And it is for all these reasons



      <pb id="p.189" n="189"/>

that flowers on graves are beautiful, and that
we hope to see them prosper accordingly.
 </p><p> But we have two more reasons for
noticing the particular grave before us.  One
is, that when we saw it for the first time, a
dog came nestling against it, as if with
affection; taking up his bed (in which we
left him,) as though he had again settled
himself beside a master.  The other, that
while again looking at the grave, and thinking
how becomingly the flowers were attended
to, being as fresh as when we saw them
before, a voice behind us said gently:
"Those are my dear children."     It was
the mother.   She had seen us, perhaps,
looking longer than was customary, and
thus been induced to speak.   We violate
no delicacy in mentioning the circumstance.  Records on tombstones are introducers of the living to the dead; makers





<pb id="p.190" n="190"/>
of mortal acquaintances; and "one touch
of nature," in making the " whole world kin,"
gives them   the right of speaking    like
kindred, to, and of, one   another.   We
expressed to the good parent our pleasure
at seeing the flowers so well kept, and for
so long a time.   She said they would be
so as long as she lived.
 </p><p> It is impossible not to respect and
 sympathize with feelings like these.  We should
say, nevertheless (and as questions of this
kind are of general interest, we address the
remark to all loving survivors,) that although
a life-long observance of such attentions
could do anything but dishonour to living
or dead, the discontinuance of it, after a
certain lapse of time, could not, of necessity,
be a reproach to either; for the practice
concerns the feelings of the one still more
than the memory of the other;     and in





     <pb id="p.191" n="191"/>

cases where it might keep open the wounds
of remembrance too long and too sorely,
no loving persons, while alive, could wish
that their survivors should take such pains to
hinder themselves from being relieved.  It
is natural for some time, often for too long
a time, to associate with the idea of the
departed, the bodies in which they lived,
and in which we loved them. Few of us
can so spiritualize their new condition all at
once, as to visit them in thought no where
but in another world.  We have been too
much accustomed to them bodily, in this.
In fact, they are still bodily with us; still in
our world, if not on it; and for a time, we
must reconcile that thought to ourselves as
well as we can; warm it with our tears;
put it on an equality with us, by means of
our very sorrow, from which, whatsoever its
other disadvantages, it is now exempt; give











<pb id="p.192" n="192"/>
it earthly privileges of some kind, whether
of flowers, or other fondness.
 </p><p> Nothing but urn-burial could help us
better; could shorten the sense of the
interval between one world and the other;
between the corporeal and the spiritual
condition; and to the practice of urn-burial,
the nations must surely return.  Population
will render it unavoidable. But in the
meantime, we must gradually let our thoughts of
the body decay, even as the body itself
decays; must consent to part with it, and
become wholly spiritual, wholly sensible that
its best affections were things of the mind
and heart; and that as those, while in this
world, could triumph over thoughts of death,
so they are now ascertaining why they were
enabled to do so, in another.
 </p><p>  Let flowers, therefore, be put awhile on
graves, and contend with the idea of death.




   <pb id="p.193" n="193"/>

Let them contend with it, if we please, as
long as we live, provided our own lives
cannot in the nature of things be long; in
which case, we are, in a manner, making
our own mortal bed with those of the
departed, and preparing to sleep sweetly together
till the great morning.  But under other
circumstances, let us learn to be content
that the flowers die, and that our companions
have gone away; for go we shall ourselves;
and it is fit that we believe them gone into
the only state, in which they cannot perish.</p>

<p>  RETURNING from the church into the <placeName key="High
Street">High
Street</placeName>, there presents itself, not many yards
further, on the right side of the way, a
curious looking brick edifice, at once slender
and robust (if the reader can imagine such a
combination); or, tall and sturdy; or, narrow,
compact, and thick in the walls.  Over the




       <pb id="p.195" n="195"/>

second story is a square tower, probably
intended to hold a bell; and originally there
was another tower above that, which must
have made the whole edifice appear
unaccountably tall.  Finally, to adopt the
convenient word of " that late eminent antiquary,
Mr. John Carter," there stands on each side
of the first story, the "costumic statue of
a charity-child."
 </p><p> It is the old Kensington Charity School,
built by Sir John Vanbrugh; now a savingsbank, with a new school-room by the side
of it.
 </p><p> Sir John, as is well known, was a wit full
of mirth in his comedies, and an architect
full of gravity in his buildings. He was the
son of a Dutchman by a French mother. A
certain Dr. Evans, who was addicted to the
like extremes in literature, though neither his
mirth nor his gravity was so good, wrote a













<pb id="p.196" n="196"/>
jesting epitaph on Sir John, the final couplet
of which has become famous:
</p><p>
     <quote rend="blockquote">    " Lie heavy on him, earth, for he
         Laid many a heavy load on thee."
</quote>
<persName key="Reynolds, Sir Joshua">Sir Joshua Reynolds</persName> however was of opinion,
that Vanbrugh's style was misconstrued,' and
that it was very poetical and noble.  The
present building has certainly contrived to look
heavy, even though it is narrow; but nobody
who looks at it can doubt that it was built to
endure.  If suffered to remain, it will, even
now, probably outlast the whole of
Kensington. Look at it, reader, as you go, with
an eye to this supposition.  Think, also,
what interest a celebrated name can attach
to a homely structure; and wonder to reflect,
that he who built it was the same " Captain
Vanbrugh," a man of " wit and pleasure about
town," who wrote the characters of romping


         <pb id="p.197" n="197"/>

Miss Hoyden and the dandy Lord Fop-
pington.
 </p><p> Next to Sir John Vanbrugh's old edifice
is the new <placeName key="Vestry Hall">Vestry Hall</placeName>, a building lately
erected in the style that prevailed in the
reign of James the First, and which has
acquired a natural popularity in this suburb
from the presence of <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>. There
is something in the style, too, very suitable
to the British climate, its bay-windows
largely admitting the light, while the
comparatively blind and solid walls are
characteristic  of warmth  and   comfort.  The
warm colours, also, of yellow and red,
that prevail in the exterior of these buildings,
and the bricks of which they are composed,
in preference to stone and stucco, are far
better for us than the cold whites of the
latter. Honest old red is the best of all.
The miserablest object in England on a





<pb id="p.198" n="198"/>

rainy day (next to the pauper that inhabits
it) is a tumble-down hut of lath and
plaster.
 </p><p> Nearly opposite the new <placeName key="Vestry Hall">Vestry Hall</placeName>, in
the house now occupied by Mr. Wright,
an ironmonger, lived for some years the
once celebrated political writer, William
Cobbett.
 </p><p> Cobbett, as some of our readers may
remember, was a self-taught man of great
natural abilities, who, from excess of
selfesteem, defect of sympathy out of the pale
of his own sphere, and a want of that
scholarly " discipline of humanity," of
which such men stand particularly in need,
went from one extreme in politics to another
with anything but misgiving; injured the
good which he otherwise did to Reform,
by a long course of obloquy and
exaggeration; brought his courage and even his



          <pb id="p.199" n="199"/>

principles into question, by retreats before
his opponents, and apparent compromises
with government; and ended a life of
indomitable industry, by obtaining the
reputation rather of a powerful and amusing,
than estimable or lasting writer.  Readers
of his "Political Register" will not easily
forget how he lorded it over public men,
as if they knew nothing, and he knew
everything;  or what letters he addressed to
them, in a style beyond the unceremonious;
such as those to the Bishop of London,
beginning "Bishop," and to Sir Robert
Peel, whom he addressed as "Peel's-Bill-Peel," and saluted simply by his surname.
 </p><p> Hazlitt said of him, that had everything
been done as he desired in church and
state, he would have differed with it all
next day, out of the pure pleasure of opposition.









<pb id="p.200" n="200"/>
 </p><p> Cobbett's worst propensity was to exult
over the fallen. His implied curses of the
hapless George the Third, who had nothing
to do with the fine and imprisonment
which produced them, are too shocking to
be repeated. He crowed unmercifully over
the suicide of Lord Castlereagh; and,
ridiculously as ungenerously, pronounced
Walter Scott, during his decline, and after
the bankruptcy which he laboured so heroically to avert, to have been nothing but a
"humbug."
 </p><p> But the vigour which he thus abused
was not to be denied. Bating an occasional
parade of the little scholarship which he
had acquired, and which sometimes betrayed him into incorrectness, even of the
grammar which he professed to teach,
nothing could surpass the pure, vigorous,
idiomatical style of his general writing, or


<pb id="p.201" n="201"/>

the graphical descriptions he would give
both of men and things, whether in artificial life, or in matters connected with his
agricultural experience. A volume of select
passages from  his writings, chiefly of this
kind might be of permanent service to his
name; which, otherwise, will be stifled under
the load of rubbish with which he mixed
it.
</p><p>  At the back of his house at <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>,
in ground now devoted to other purposes,
and also at a farm, which he possessed at
the same time, not far off (at Barn-Elm),
Cobbett cultivated his Indian corn, his
American Forest Trees, his pigs, poultry,
and butchers' meat, all which he pronounced
to be the best that was ever beheld; but
the aristocratic suburb did not prove a
congenial soil, and he quitted it, a bankrupt.
He   appears,  nevertheless, to  have succeeded,



<pb id="p.202" n="202"/>
 upon the whole, in a worldly point
of view, and ultimately made his way into
parliament; a triumph, however, which was
probably the death of him, owing to the late
hours and bad air for which he exchanged
his farming habits of life. At all events,
he did not survive it long. Like many men
who make a great noise in public, he seems
to have been a good, quiet sort of man in
private;  occasionally  blustering  a  little,
perhaps, at his workmen, and more dictatorial to them than he would have liked
others to be to himself; but a good husband
and father, a pleasant companion; and his
family seem to have heartily lamented him
when he died; the best of all testimonies
to private worth.  His appearance (to judge
by his portraits, for we never saw him) was
characteristic of the man, except as regarded
vanity. He dressed plainly and unaffectedly;

     <pb id="p.203" n="203"/>

was strong and well-built; and had a large
forehead, and roundish and somewhat small
features, for the size of his cheeks, a disparity betokening greater will than selfcontrol.
 </p><p> Cobbett said little of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, considering the time he lived there.  It was not to
be expected, indeed, that he could be fond
of a place that had a palace at one end
of it, the mansion of a Whig lord at the
other, and in which he did not find himself either welcome or prosperous. What he
does say, chiefly concerns his corn and his
trees. There are but one or two passages
characteristic of the locality, and those are
more so of himself, and not unamusing.  In
one of them he speaks of the poor Irish,
who stand at the corners of the streets,
" their rags dancing with the wind ;" but
he does it rather to rebuke than to pity





<pb id="p.204" n="204"/>
them. He could not get them to work
for victuals instead of money; not taking
into consideration, that the poor, rackrented creatures could not pay their landlord
without it. A correspondent proposed to pay
Cobbett himself in victuals for his Weekly
Register, two pounds of mutton per quarter;
but the rebuker of the Irish is very angry at
this; and assuming, with a somewhat Irish
and self-refuting logic, that a man who did
not approve of payments in meat, must be
addicted to slops, and have a dirty complexion, calls him  a "tea-kettle reptile,"
and a " squalid wretch."
 </p><p> The other passage gives us his opinion
of the reviews in Hyde Park, and their consumption of gunpowder. His compliments
to American economy in the use of that material, are hardly flattering to a great nation; but everything was excessive in the




      <pb id="p.205" n="205"/>

praise and blame which he bestowed, and,
consequently, was in the habit of undoing
itself.
</p><p>  Speaking of the Duke of Clarence's appointment to the office of Lord High Admiral, he says, that when he first heard of
it, he was "very much pleased, because
he thought it would tend to break up the
Scotch phalanx, which appeared to him to
be taking the whole navy by storm." He
adds:
 </p><p> "The manner of executing the office was
a thing which I had little time to attend to;
but I must confess, that I soon became tired
of the apparent incessant visiting of the seaports, and the firing of salutes.  I see the
Americans getting forward with a navy, fit
to meet us in war, without more noise than
is made by half-a-dozen mice, when they get
into my pantry or cupboard. These Yankees




<pb id="p.206" n="206"/>
 have an education wonderfully well
calculated to make them economical in the
affairs of war.  I never saw one of them
in my life, man or boy, shoot at any living
thing without killing it. A Yankee never
discharges his gun at anything, until he
has made a calculation of the value of the
thing; and if that value does not exceed
the value of the powder and the shot, the
gun remains with the charge in it, until
something presents itself of value surpassing
that of the charge.  In shooting at
partridges, quails, squirrels, and other things
of the land kind, they always count the
number of shot they put into the gun,
and will put in no more than they think
the carcass of the animal will pay for,
leaving a certain clear profit, after the cost
of labour. These are most excellent principles to be imbibed by those who are destined


    <pb id="p.207" n="207"/>

 to conduct the affairs of war; and
when I, being in a sea-port, hear bang,
bang, bang, on one side of me, answered
by other bangs on the other side, and find no
soul that can tell me what the noise is for;
or when I, being at <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, hear,
coming from <placeName key="High Street">High Street</placeName>, pop, pop, pop-pop, pop-pop, pop, pop, pop, the cause of
which I remember but too well; when I
hear these sounds, I cannot help lamenting,
that our commanders, by sea and land, did
not receive their education among the Yankees, who have raised a fleet, the existence
of which we shall one day have to rue;
and I should not be afraid to bet all I
have in the world, that they have done it
without wasting  one   single  pound  of
powder."<note place="foot" n="1">Political Register, Vol. 66, p. 267.</note>












<pb id="p.208" n="208"/>
 </p><p> Fancy our young Nelsons and Jervises
going to America to learn how to shoot;
and their unerring teachers, man or boy,
holding their hands before they begin, till
they counted the relative values of the
charge and the cock-sparrow.
 </p><p> Never, we verily believe, was gunpowder
expended at less cost, or to better purpose,
than in our reviews and royal salutes; for
the sounds reach the ears of despots. Nobler
spectacles of warlike power were never beheld,
than those which were presented to the world
the other day under the presidency of a
sovereign, who being a wife and mother,
must needs represent peace itself, and hatred
of wars; but being a queen also, must
also represent the power, which warns,
and is prepared to punish, the infractors
of peace.  Most desirable is peace; most
horrible and detestable is war; and no




    <pb id="p.209" n="209"/>

magnanimity will have been wanting to
endure its idiotical babble, and endeavour
to stay its arm. But if the blow must be
struck, it must. And we hope and believe,
that if ever the  existence of American
power is to be rued by the Old World,
it will be not in antagonism with England,
but side by side with it, and to the final
confusion of all who hate the crowned
freedom of the one, still more, perhaps, than
the  republicanism  of its  brother;  for
England disproves their identification of
monarchical  government   with   despotic
will.
 </p><p> Cobbett's premises at the back, neighboured those of a small mansion, Scarsdale
House, which he must have considered an
eyesore, for it belonged to a noble family,
and was then a boarding-school; a thing
which he hated, for its inducing tradesmen's





<pb id="p.210" n="210"/>
 and farmers' daughters to play on the
pianoforte. He saw the dangers attending
the elevation of ranks in society, but none
of its advantages, except in regard to eating
and drinking, and those he would have confined to his own beef and bacon. A little
onward  from    Mr.   Wright's  door, is
Wright's Lane, which turns out of High
Street, and, containing Scarsdale House and
Scarsdale Terrace, leads round by a pleasant,
sequestered corner into the fields, and terminates this point of Kensington with the
New  Workhouse.   Scarsdale House, now
no longer a boarding-school, appears to
have returned into the occupation of the
family who rare understood to have built
it; for its present inmate is the Hon. E.
Curzon, one of the gentlemen who contributed
to the collection of cabinet-work at Gore
House.   From  an intimation, however, in




     <pb id="p.211" n="211"/>

Faulkner, it would seem as if it had been
called Scarsdale House before the creation
of the title in the Curzon and Howe-Curzon families; in which case, it was
probably built by the Earl of Scarsdale,
whose family name was Leake, the Scarsdale celebrated by Pope and Rowe for his
love of the bottle and of Mrs. Bracegirdle.
</p><p>

   <quote rend="blockquote">   Each mortal has his pleasure;-none deny
      Scarsdale his bottle, Darty his ham-pie.

Darty was Dartineuf, or Dartiquenare, (a
famous epicure.)

</p><p>
      <quote rend="blockquote">  Do not most fragrant Earl disclaim
        Thy bright, thy reputable flame

<pb id="p.212" n="212"/>
  </p><p>Earl Leake, by other accounts besides
these, does not appear to have been a
person whom   "Bracegirdle the brown,"
the charmer of the age, would have thought
it any very desirable honour to marry.
We hope, therefore, that the more respectable Scarsdales, the Curzons, were always
possessors of the house, and that, in
displacing the boarding-school, they illustrate, as in greater instances, the injunction
of their curious motto,   "Let Curzon
hold what Curzon held."
 </p><p> The corner, above-mentioned, of Wright's
Lane, contains  a  batch  of good    old
family houses, one of which belonged to
Sir Isaac Newton, though it is not known
that he ever lived in it. A house in which
he did live we shall come to by-and-bye.
 </p><p> The Workhouse to which you arrive in
turning by this corner, is a large, handsome,

    <pb id="p.213" n="213"/>

 brick building, in the old style beforementioned, possessed of a garden with seats
in it, and looking (upon the old principle of
association in such matters) more like a
building for a lord than for a set of paupers.
Paupers, however, by the help of Christianity, have been discovered, by the wiser
portion of their fellow-creatures, to be
persons whom it is better to treat kindly
than contemptuously; and hence, as new
workhouses arise, something is done to
rescue the pauper-mind from its worst, most
hopeless, and most exasperating sense of
degradation, and let it participate some
taste of the good consequences of industry
and refinement.</p>

It is one of the consequences of the general
rise in society. But people would do well
to learn the meanings of the words before
they employ them; not to christen young

" bravo" (brave he!) to female singers,
instead of "brava;" nor give the appellation of heights to rows of houses that are
on a level with a valley.
  In Kensington, Sir David Wilkie, the
painter, passed the greater part of his life,




<pb id="p.216" n="216"/>

after quitting <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, and chiefly in <placeName key="Lower
Phillimore Place">Lower
Phillimore Place</placeName>.  For nearly three years,
beginning with the autumn of <date value="1811">1811</date>, he
dates his letters from No. 29, which was
the abode of a friend; but he then took one
of his own, No. 24, in which he resided
with his mother and sister till the autumn
of <date value="1824">1824</date>, when he removed with them into
the house on the Terrace, called Shaftesbury
House, which has since been rebuilt on a
larger scale. Why it is called Shaftesbury
House, we cannot learn; perhaps because
the third Earl of Shaftesbury, the author
of the " Characteristicks," who was a visitor
at the Palace, occupied it for a while before
he took his house at Little <placeName key="Chelsea">Chelsea</placeName>.  Probably, there is not an old house in Kensington,
in which some distinguished person has not
resided, during the reigns in which the
court was held there.




         <pb id="p.217" n="217"/>

 </p><p> Wilkie was a gentle, kindly, considerate
man, with a figure not insignificant though
not elegant, an arch eye, and a large,
good-humoured mouth.   Such, at least, was
his appearance during the time of life at
which we remember him. He had an original genius for depicturing humble life,
and could throw into it a dash of the comic;
though he did not possess the Flemish and
Dutch eye for colour; and there was altogether more truth than enjoyment in his
style, sometimes a tendency to dwell on
moral and even physical pains, the sufferers
of which neutralized the sympathy which
they needed by a look of sordid dulness.
 </p><p> Hazlitt, out of resentment against the
aristocracy for giving their patronage to
this kind of art at the expense of higher,
of which he thought them jealous (and







<pb id="p.218" n="218"/>

perhaps, also, in order to vex Wilkie himself, who was very deferential to rank),
called it the "pauper style."  The appellation, we suspect, produced the vexation
intended, and was one of the causes of
Sir David's efforts to rise into a manner
altogether different; in which he was not
successful. His notion that the persons in
the Old and New Testament should all
have the native, that is to say, the Syrian or
Judaical look, showed the restricted and
literal turn of his mind. He fancied that
this kind of truth would the more recommend them to the lovers of truth in
general; not seeing, that the local peculiarity
might hurt the universality of the impression; for though all the world feel more
or less in the same manner, they are not
fond of seeing the manner qualified by that
of any one particular nation; especially, too,




    <pb id="p.219" n="219"/>

when the nation has not been associated in
their minds with anything very acceptable,
or even with acquiescence in the impression
to be made.  The next step in this direction might be to represent St. Paul as a
man of an insignificant presence, because
the apostle so describes himself; or to get a
stammering man to sit for the portrait of
Moses, because the great law-giver had an
impediment in his speech.  This is not
what Raphael did when he painted Paul
preaching at Athens, with mighty, uplifted arms; nor what Michael Angelo did,
when he seated Moses in the chair of Sinai,
indignantly overlooking all beneath him, and
ready to hurl down the tables of stone, like
thunderbolts, on the heads of his misbelieving followers. We do not mean to say,
that lovers of truth might not be found,
who would accord with Sir David's opinion,












<pb id="p.220" n="220"/>
 and let good consequences take their
chance; but he did not look at the matter
in this comprehensive light. He thought,
that there was no risk of chance, remote or immediate, except in not making
the local history local enough; and he did
not see, that this would have endangered the
object he had in view, and served to contract
instead of extending it.
 </p><p> Though Wilkie never married, one of
the best features in his character was domesticity. He was no sooner rich enough,
than he brought his mother and sister from
<placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>, in order that they might partake
his prosperity in the way most agreeable to
family affections. He was also careful to
give them news of himself before they
came. As it is pleasant to know the daily
habits of distinguished men, we give the
following account of his life at <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>




      <pb id="p.221" n="221"/>

 from one of his letters to his sis-
ter.
 </p><p> "The anxiety my mother has laboured
under about my health, on seeing that I had
not with my own hand directed the newspaper, is entirely groundless. I am as well
now as I have been for a very long time,
and am going on with the painting in my
usual moderate way. I am sometimes glad
to get anybody to direct the newspaper on
the Monday forenoon, for the sake of saving time, which is an important consideration in these short days. Everybody I meet
with compliments me on the improvement
of my looks, and I am taking all the means
in my power to retain my improved appearance. I dine, as formerly, at two o'clock,
paint two hours in the forenoon and two
hours in the afternoon, and take a short
walk in the park or through the fields twice




    <pb id="p.223" n="223"/>

</p><p> In <placeName key="Shaftesbury House">Shaftesbury House</placeName> the sunny portion
of Wilkie's life terminated in clouds that
gathered suddenly and darkly upon him;
-his mother dying; his sister losing the
man she was about to marry; his eldest
brother dead, in <placeName key="India">India</placeName>; a second brother
coming home to die, from Canada; a
younger brother involved in commercial
difficulties; and the artist himself, who was
too generous not to suffer in every way
with his family, losing further money by
the failure of houses, and failing in his own
health, which he never recovered.   Such
are the calamities to which comic as well as
tragic painters are liable, in order that all
men may share and share alike, till "tears
can be wiped from off all faces."  Wilkie
subsequently removed to Vicarage Place, in
Church Street; and this, his last abode
in <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, was also his last in England.

a day. In the evening, I go on with the
mathematics, which I take great delight in;
and I have also begun a system of algebra,
a study I should like to learn something
of too."
</p><p>  When his mother and sister came, the
good artist took care that as much as
possible of the old household furniture, to which

 </p><p>After all, there was in Wilkie's character,
as there is in most men's, however amusing
they may be, a grave as well as comic side,
corresponding with the affectionate portion
of it; and this, very likely, it was, that in
conjunction  with the  provocation  given
him by Hazlitt and by jealous brother
artists, led him to attempt at higher subjects, and a deeper tone in painting. He

       <pb id="p.225" n="225"/>

also appears to have had a delicacy of
organization, tending to the consumptive;
though prudence and prosperity kept him
alive to the age of fifty-six.
 </p><p> "Nature is vindicated of her children."
The sensibilities of a man of genius turn
to good account for his fellow-creatures,
compared with whom he is but a unit.
Wilkie, himself, enjoyed, as well as suffered:
he had a happy fireside during the greater
part of his life; he had always an artist's
eye, which is itself a remuneration; and he
knew that ages to come would find merit
in his productions.
 </p><p> Turning northward out of the high
road, between Lower and Upper Phillimore
Place, is Hornton Street, at the further
house in which, on the right hand, resided
for some years, Doctor Thomas Frognall
Dibdin, the sprightliest of bibliomaniacs.

          <pb id="p.227" n="227"/>

books had been worth as much inside as
out; but in a question between the finest of
works in plain calf, and one of the fourth or
fifth-rate, old and rare, and bound by Charles
Lewis, the old book would have carried it
hollow.  It would even have   been read
with the greater devotion. However, the
mania was harmless, and helped to maintain a proper   curiosity into past ages.
Tom (for, though a Reverend, and a
Doctor, we can hardly think of him seriously) was a good-natured fellow, not very
dignified in any respect; but he had the
rare merit of being candid. A moderate
sum of money was bequeathed him by
Douce;   and  he  said  he  thought he
deserved it, from  the "respectful attention"
he had always paid to that not very agreeable gentleman.  Tom  was by no means
ill-looking; yet he tells us, that being in







<pb id="p.226" n="226"/>

He was not a mere bibliomaniac.     He
really saw, though not very far, into the
merit of the books which he read. He also
made some big books of his own, which
though, for the most part, of little interest
but to little antiquaries, contain passages
amusing for their animal spirits and enjoyment. When the Doctor visited libraries on
the continent, he dined with the monks and
others who possessed them, and made a
feast-day of it with the gaiety of his
company. When he assembled his friends
over a new publication, or for the purpose
of inspecting a set of old ones, the meeting
was what he delighted to call a " symposium ;" that is to say, they drank as well
as ate, and were very merry over old books,
old words, and what they persuaded themselves was old wine.  There would have
been a great deal of reason in it all, if the






<pb id="p.228" n="228"/>

company, when he was young, with an
elderly gentleman, who knew his father,
and the gentleman being asked by somebody whether the son resembled him, "Not
at all!" was the answer.  "Captain Dibdin
was a fine-looking fellow."
 </p><p> This same father was the real glory of
Tom; for the reader must know, that
Captain Dibdin was no less a person than
the "Tom   Bowling" of the famous seasong:
</p><p>
   <quote rend="blockquote">   Here a sheer hulk lies poor Tom Bowling,
      The darling of our crew.

 </p><p> Captain Thomas Dibdin was the brother
of Charles Dibdin, the songster of the
seamen; and an admirable fellow was
Charles, and a fine fellow, in every respect,
the brother thus fondly recorded by him.
"No more," (continues the song, for the



      <pb id="p.229" n="229"/>

reader will not grudge us the pleasure of
calling it to mind)
</p><p>
   <quote rend="blockquote">   No more he'll hear the tempest howling,

        His form was of the manliest beauty,

         Faithful below he did his duty,

</quote>

  </p><p>Dr. Dibdin was thus the nephew of a man
of genius, and the son of one of the best
specimens of an Englishman. His memory
may be content.
 </p><p> The Doctor relates an anecdote of the
house opposite him, which he considers equal
to any  "Romance of Real Life."         This
comes of the antiquarian habit of speaking
in superlatives, and expressing amazement
at every little thing. As the circumstance,
however, is complete of its kind, and the




<pb id="p.230" n="230"/>
kind, though not so rare, we suspect, as may
be imagined, is not one of every-day occurrence, it may be worth repeating. A handsome widow, it seems, in the prime of life,
but in reduced circumstances, and with a
family of several children, had been left in
possession of the house, and desired to let it.
A retired merchant of sixty, who was looking
out for a house in Kensington, came to see
it. He fell in love with the widow; paid
his addresses to her on the spot, in a respectful version of the old question put to
the fair showers of such houses (" Are you,
my dear, to be let with the lodgings ?");
and after a courtship of six months, was
wedded to the extemporaneous object of his
affections at Kensington Church, the Doctor
himself joyfully officiating as clergyman; for
the parties were amiable; the bridegroom
was a collector of books; and the books were



     <pb id="p.231" n="231"/>

accompanied by a cellar full of burgundy
and champagne.
 </p><p> Returning into the high road, and continuing our path on the Terrace side of the
way, we come to Leonard's Place, and to
Earl's Court Terrace, in both of which Mrs.
Inchbald resided  for  some months, in
boarding-houses; in the former, at a Mrs.
Voysey's; in the latter, at No. 4. Boarding-houses, though their compulsory hours of
eating and drinking did not suit her, she
found more agreeable than other lodgings,
owing to their supplying her with more
companionship, and giving her more to do
for her companions.   The poor souls in
these places appear to need it. Speaking of
the kind of hospital at Mrs. Voysey's, in the
summer of <date value="1818">1818</date>, she says,-"All the old
widows and old maids of this house are
stretched upon beds or sofas, with swollen










<pb id="p.232" n="232"/>
legs, nervous head-aches, or slow fevers;
brought on by loss of appetite, broken sleep,
and other dog-day complaints; while I am
the only young and strong person among
them, and am called upon to divert their
blue devils from bringing them to an
untimely end.  I love to be of importance;
and so the present society is flattering to
my vanity."
</p><p>She was then sixty-five. What a god-send
to the poor creatures she must have been!
A woman of genius, very entertaining, full
of anecdote and old stories, and though so
young in mind, yet of an age bodily to keep
them in heart with themselves, and so make
hope to live on.
  </p><p>At the back of Earl's Terrace, was, and
is, a curious, pretty little spot,  called
Edwardes Square, after the family name of
Lord Kensington; and in this square Mrs.


  <pb id="p.233" n="233"/>

Inchbald must often have walked, for the
inhabitants of the Terrace have keys to it,
and it gives them a kind of larger garden.
We have called the spot curious as well as
pretty, and so it is in  many respects,-in
one of them contradictory to the prettiness,
for one side of the square is formed of the
backs and garden-walls of the Earl's Terrace
houses, and the opposite side of its
coachhouses, and of little tenements that appear
to have been made out of them. The whole
of this latter side, however, is plastered,
and partly overgrown with ivy, so as to
be rather an ornament than an eyesore.
But what chiefly surprises the spectator,
when   he first sees the   place, is  the
largeness, as well as cultivated look of
the square, compared with the smallness of
the houses on two sides of it. The gardener's lodge, also, is made to look like





<pb id="p.234" n="234"/>

a Grecian temple, really in good taste; and
though the grass is not as thick and soft as
it might be, nor the flowers as various, and
pathways across the grass had better have
been straight than winding (there being no
inequalities of ground to render the winding
natural), yet, upon the whole, there is such
an unexpected air of size, greenness, and
even elegance in the place, especially when its
abundant lilacs are in blossom, and ladies are
seen on its benches reading, that the stroller,
who happens to turn out of the road, and
comes upon the fresh-looking sequestered
spot for the first time, is interested as well as
surprised, and feels curious to know how a
square of any kind, comparatively so large,
and, at the same time, manifestly so cheap
(for the houses, though neat and respectable, are too small to be dear), could have
suggested itself to the costly English mind.




      <pb id="p.235" n="235"/>

Upon inquiry, he finds it to have been the
work of a Frenchman.
 </p><p> The story is, that the Frenchman built
it at the time of the threatened invasion
from <placeName key="France">France</placeName>; and that he adapted the
large square and the cheap little houses
to the promenading tastes and poorly-furnished pockets of the ensigns and lieutenants
of Napoleon's army; who, according to his
speculation, would certainly have been on
the look-out for some such place, and
here would have found it. Here, thought
he, shall be cheap lodging and fete champetre combined; here, economy in-doors
and Watteau without; here, repose after
victory; promenades; la belle passion;
perusal of newspapers on benches; an ordinary at the Holland Arms,-a French
Arcadia in short, or a little Palais Royal, in
an English suburb.  So runs the tradition;






<pb id="p.236" n="236"/>
we do not say how truly, though it could
hardly have entered an English head to
invent it.
</p><p>  It was allowable for French imaginations
in those days to run a little wild, on the
strength of Napoleon's victories. We do
not repeat the story for the sake of saying
how wild. We believe that both Frenchmen
and Englishmen, at present, for reasons best
known to all governments, not actually out
of their senses, are for keeping their localities
as peaceably and regularly as possible ; and
we devoutly hope they may continue to do
so, not only for the sake of the two greatest
nations in Europe, but for that of the security
of advancement. For it is better to advance
gently, however slowly, than to be incessantly thrown back from one extreme to
another; and the world and right opinion
will progress as surely as time does, whatever



  <pb id="p.237" n="237"/>

efforts despots and bigots may make to
put back the clock.
 </p><p> It is said, in <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, that Coleridge
once had lodgings in Edwardes Square.
We do not find the circumstance in his
biographies, though he once lived in the
neighbouring village of Hammersmith. Perhaps, he was on a visit to a friend; for we
are credibly informed, that he used to be
seen walking in the square. A lady who was
a child at the time, is very proud of his
having spoken to her, and given her a
kiss.</p>

 <p><placeName key="HOLLAND House">HOLLAND House</placeName> is the only important
mansion, venerable for age and appearance,
which is now to be found in the neighbourhood of London.  There has been talk more
than once of pulling it down; but every


     <pb id="p.239" n="239"/>

feeling of memory seems to start up at the
threat, and cry, No, No! The cry is not
only one of the utmost parliamentary propriety: the weight of the whole voice of the
metropolis may be said to be in it; nay, of
the nation itself; and even of the civilized
world; for what court or diplomatist that
knows of the "Whigs,"     knows not of
"<placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> ?" or what foreigner, with
any taste for English wit and localities, visits
London without going to see it ? It is not
handsome; it is not ancient; but it is of
an age sufficient to make up for want of
beauty; it shows us how our ancestors built
before Shakspeare died; a crowd of the
reigning wits and beauties of that, and every
succeeding generation passes through it to
the "mind's eye," brilliant with life and
colour; and there it stands yet, on its old
rising ground, with its proper accompaniment









<pb id="p.240" n="240"/>

 of sward    and   trees, to  gratify
everybody  that  can  appreciate it, and
shame any one that would do it wrong.
May   it everlastingly  be repaired,  and
never look   otherwise  than  past times
beheld it.
 </p><p> The upper apartments of <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>
are on a level with the stone gallery of the
dome of St. Paul's.  Their front windows
command a view of the Surrey hills; as those
of the back do of Harrow, Hampstead, and
Highgate.
 </p><p> When this interesting old mansion came
into the possession of the present lord, seeing
the masons at work, and finding one of
the approaches to it stopped up, we trembled
at what he might be going to do with it.
That approach was called Nightingale Lane,
and had long been a favourite with the Kensingtonians; for, besides enabling them to

     <pb id="p.241" n="241"/>

get closer to the nightingales, it afforded
them a passage right in front of the house.
This passage was now closed; a parapet
wall was taking place of it; two stone piers,
designed by Inigo Jones, disappeared from
the court-yard; and everything looked as if
the appearance of the house itself was about
to be altered.
 </p><p> The alarm, however, proved false. The
house, externally, remained untouched; and
when the stone piers, not very intelligible in
their previous distance from one another,
were found composing a gate at the side of
it, and vases of geraniums made their appearance on the parapet wall, and orange
trees came in front of the geraniums, and the
shut-up lane was compounded for by a new
one, which, though it led only by a side of
the house, opened a more convenient passage
to Notting Hill, and was furnished, moreover,











<pb id="p.242" n="242"/>
 with a bench like those in the parks,
to give a resting-place to passengers themselves, (persons not too often cared for in
aristocratical  changes,)  the  alterations,
though producing an effect perhaps not
thoroughly harmonious between the northern
architecture and its southern accompaniments, could not but be acknowledged to be
improvements in the main, and to have rendered the entire spot more noticeable and
attractive.
 </p><p> The aged look of the exterior of Holland
House is the more precious to the antiquary, inasmuch as with the exception of
a staircase or so, it is the only part of its
antiquity remaining. The interior has long
been so modernized, that a lover of old times
is grieved to find not a single room in it
which brings them before him. There is
little which is older than the youth of the




      <pb id="p.243" n="243"/>

late lord, and much that has been further
modernized by the present. The fact is,
that the house had become so neglected
during the nonage of the former, in consequence of the reckless expenditures of the
first lord and his son Charles (the great
Whig leader) that there was talk of converting it into a workhouse. Lord Holland, a
respecter of old associations, and of the
pleasures of other people, saved it; and this
circumstance should be counted among the
claims to respect of his own genial memory.
 </p><p> The lodge, which the new lord has renovated and doubled, is in a style suitable
to the mansion; with the exception, perhaps, of the two footway entrances, which
look a little flimsy.  The retention of the
gilding on the iron gates may be objected to
by some, as partaking of the same character;
but we think otherwise. The gilding is but











<pb id="p.244" n="244"/>
partial; it relieves (to our eyes) the sombreness of the iron; and, being confined to the
ornamental portion of the work, gives it a
kind of golden efflorescence. We have not
enough of this kind of work in England;
do not sufficiently avail ourselves of the
bright lights and colours that we might
bring to bear on our sombre climate. To
see, on a dark, wet, muddy day, all the
people going along in dark or brown colours,
everything  looking dingy or insipid-the
houses insipid, the carts and waggons insipid,
most of the carriages equally so, and the faces
either to match or full of care, the circumstances all seem to conspire with the weather
to cut as miserable an appearance as
possible; as though the passengers were
tacitly saying,
</p><p>
        <quote rend="blockquote"> " Let us all be unhappy together."
</quote>




      <pb id="p.245" n="245"/>

</p><p>  We are aware that there is a " harmony "
in the spectacle; but it is a wretched
harmony; and we think a little cheerful
discord would be better. Nobody objects
to a rainbow. Flowers, protected by verandahs in balconies, are welcome to the eyes
in any weather. There are colours that suit
darkness; and a good diffusion of them at
such times would be a god-send. For our
parts, we always feel grateful on a rainy
day, when we see a market woman go by
in a red cloak.
  </p><p>Of   the  lawn,  or  rather  meadow,
which  lies in front of <placeName key="Holland   House">Holland   House</placeName>,
there is a tradition that Cromwell and
Ireton  conferred  in it, as a  place in
which  they  could  not  be   overheard.
From    circumstances  hereafter  to  be
noticed, the  tradition  is  probable.  It
shows that whatever the subject of the





<pb id="p.246" n="246"/>
conference may have been, they could not
have objected to being seen; for there was
neither wall, nor even trees, we believe, at
that time in front of the house, as there
is now; and we may fancy royalists riding
by, on their road to Brentford, where the
king's forces were defeated, and trembling
to see the two grim republicans laying their
heads together.
 </p><p> The grounds at the back of the house
are more extensive than might be supposed,
and contain many fine old trees of various
kinds, with spots of charming seclusion. The
portion nearest the house presents an expanse
of turf of the most luxurious description,
with a most noble elm-tree upon it, and
an alcove facing the west, in which there is
a couplet that was put up by the late
lord in honour of Mr. Rogers, and a copy
of verses by Mr. Luttrell, expressing his





      <pb id="p.247" n="247"/>

inability to emulate the poet. The couplet
is as follows:
</p><p>
<quote rend="blockquote">
     " Here Rogers sat, and here for ever dwell,
     To me, those pleasures that he sang so well."
                                    VLL. HD.</quote>


 </p><p> Inscriptions challenge comments; brief
ones, it is thought, ought in particular to
be faultless; seats in summer time, and
loungings about on luxurious turfs (half an
hour before dinner), beget the most exacting
criticisms;  and thus a nice question has
arisen, whether the relative pronoun in this
couplet ought to be that or which. Our
first impression was in favour of that; but
happening to repeat the lines next morning
while in the act of walking, we involuntarily
said which; upon which side of the question
we are accordingly prepared to fight, with



<pb id="p.248" n="248"/>

all the inveteracy of deserters from the
other.
 </p><p> Lord Holland's couplet is in the simple
and tranquil taste which he had so much
right to admire; Mr. Luttrell's verses, which
are a score longer, would have been improved
by compression.    They   are  a  sample   of
the difference which they themselves speak
of, between natural and artificial writing, or
that which is prompted by what is felt, and
that which would emulate the expression of
others. The old eighteenth century fashion
of rhyming    with its "heart    and  impart,
rove, grove," &amp;c., is here (literally) in all its
glory. But see how pleasant and readable
are one or two natural expressions:
</p><p>

   <quote rend="blockquote">"Well, now I am fairly installed in the bower,
   How lovely the scene ! how propitious the hour!
   The breeze is perfum'd, from the hawthorn it stirs,
   All is silent around me-but nothing occurs;


          <pb id="p.249" n="249"/>

   Not a thought, I protest, though I'm here and alone;
   Not a chance of a couplet that Rogers would own;
   Though my senses are raptur'd, my feelings in tune,
   And Holland's my host, and the season is June.


   So I rise, since the Muses continue to frown,
   No more of a poet than when I sat down."
</quote>

 </p><p>  Beyond this mossy lawn is the open
undulating ground, terminated by the Uxbridge Road, with which the public have
become acquainted by means of the Highland
Pastimes; all round the grounds is a rustic
lane, furnishing a long, leafy walk; on the
western side of the house are small gardens,
both in new and old styles, the work of
the late Lady Holland, and the latter very
properly retained, both as a variety from
the former, and as a fitting accompaniment
to the old house.     It is also pleasant to
fancy in what sort of way our grandmothers





<pb id="p.250" n="250"/>

and great-grandmothers, the Chloes and
Delias of the eighteenth century, enjoyed
their flower-beds. In one of these gardens
was raised the first specimen of that
beautiful flower the dahlia, which the late
Lord Holland is understood to have brought
from <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>; in another, on a pedestal, is a
colossal bust of Napoleon by a pupil of
Canova; further west, towards the Addison
Road, are the Moats; which (to say nothing
of the evidence furnished by an apocryphal
bit of brickwork that accompanies them)
are looked upon as the site of the older
mansion belonging to the De Veres; and
further still, a few years ago was an expiatory classical altar, erected by the same
lord in memory of the fate of poor Lord
Camelford, a man half out of his wits, who
was killed on this spot in a duel which he
insisted  on  provoking.  We know    not




   <pb id="p.251" n="251"/>

why it was removed; probably to efface
the melancholy impression.
</p><p>  The bust of <persName key="Napoleon">Napoleon</persName> is inscribed with

taken into its pages in the lump.</note>  Upon    this inscription it may be
observed, that harsh men certainly had
the keeping of the hero; who had been,
however, a harsh man himself, and kept
thousands of men in worse durance. But
his keepers were not only harsh; they were
mean and shabby; refused him a title in
his adversity, which they were prepared to
acknowledge had he consented to their
terms, when they doubted the issue of the
contest; and they suffered him to be
worried by a set of men incapable of
understanding  him, except as jailers.     It
was the revenge of long-defeated dullness
upon fallen genius, and is a blot in the
history of England's greatness.

 </p><p> The altar in memory of Lord Camelford
was an ancient Roman one, erected on a
modern base, and was inscribed with a
propitiatory dedication to departed souls,
or the gods who preside over places of the
dead-a curious instance of classical " making
as if "-of playing at Paganism on so serious
an occasion. It was quite, however, in the
taste of the last century, and was a local
relief to the imagination.

  </p><p>Lord Camelford's body, however, is not
here. With the passion for going to extremes, which characterised him, he directed
that it should be buried under a tree in a
solitary spot in Switzerland, which had interested him during his travels. He was





<pb id="p.254" n="254"/>

a Pitt, nephew to the great Earl of Chatham,
who wrote him letters when a boy, that
show how little sometimes can be done in
directing the future career even of a child
otherwise intelligent, who has been born,
from whatever cause, with a certain wildness
in his blood. The poor youth, who came
to his end before he was thirty, was wildness
itself in many respects, though he was fond
of  serious studies.  His manners were
perfect at times, but at others would burst
out into arrogance and insolence. He was
a Christian, it is said, upon conviction, and
yet could quarrel with a man about a prostitute, and insist upon fighting him, notwithstanding all that could be done to adjust the
difference. The reason he gave was, that his
antagonist was too good a shot to make it up
with.  This antagonist was a Mr. Best.
Lord Camelford went up to him in Stevens's




          <pb id="p.255" n="255"/>

Hotel in Bond Street, and addressed him in
the following placid words; "Mr. Best, I
am glad to see you face to face, and to tell
you, you are an infamous scoundrel."  He
afterwards confessed, like a gentleman, that
he had been the aggressor.
 </p><p> But an old house is not perfect without
a ghost, and <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> has two. They
do not indeed haunt it, and were very
transient in their appearance; but they will
serve to give a bit of ghostly interest to the
spot, for those whose imaginations like to
"catch a fearful joy" on such points. The
account is in Aubrey's " Miscellanies," which
were written in the reign of William  the
Third.
 </p><p> "The   beautiful Lady   Diana   Rich,
daughter to the Earl of Holland, as she was
walking in her father's garden at <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>,
to take the fresh air before dinner, about










<pb id="p.256" n="256"/>

eleven o'clock, being then very well, met
with her own apparition, habit and everything, as in a looking-glass. About a month
after, she died of the small-pox. And it is
said, that her sister, the Lady Isabella
Thynne, saw the like of herself also, before
she died. This account I had from a person
of honour."
 </p><p> Aubrey, though his gossip is valuable to
a lover of books, was credulous to excess.
It is impossible, however, to say what visions
may not be seen by people in bad states of
health-what actual images the imagination,
in certain morbid states of the brain, may not
bring before the eye.  Nicolai, the German
bookseller, was in the habit of seeing spectral
men and women pass through his room;
and a sick young lady, just dressed for
dinner, and full of thoughts of herself,
sickly or otherwise, might as well see


      <pb id="p.257" n="257"/>

her own image as that of any one
else.
 </p><p> The Lady Isabella Thynne, here mentioned, wife of one of the ancestors of the
Marquis of Bath, is mentioned in another
of Aubrey's books (the " Lives and Letters
of Eminent Men ") as addicted to anything
but ghostly communications.   She and a
friend of hers, he says, while on a visit to
Oxford, used to come to morning prayers
at Trinity College  Chapel, "half-dressed,
like angels."  She would also make her
entrance upon the college walks, with a
"lute playing before her;" and must have
been a great puzzle to the college ethics, for
she is described as possessing all kinds of
virtues but one.  She is the " Lady Isabella"
whose playing on the lute is recorded
in a set of complimentary verses by Waller:

cannot call to mind in what book, that
she suffered a good deal of affliction before
she died.

the former has continued to look for many

to its inmates, and to those who went before
them in the possession of the estate; that
is to say, the possessors of the older house
which is now gone, as well as those which
have occupied the one before us.

<p> WE have observed and regretted, that
the interior of <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> has been
so modernized, as, with little exception, to
retain no appearance of the antiquity to be
expected from its appearance outside. We





<pb id="p.260" n="260"/>
found, nevertheless, so much to interest us
in it (the conversation included of the
gallant kinsman of the family, who was so
kind as to do us the honour of being our
cicerone,) that, as is too often the case with
something one is bent upon recollecting,
we forgot to ask for the chamber in which
Addison died.  We believe, however, it is
among the few apartments that are not
shown. Among those which are, is Charles
Fox's bed-room; that of Mr. Rogers, (a
frequent visitor,) with a poet's view over the
country towards Harrow; and that of
Sheridan, in the next room to which a
servant was regularly in attendance all
night; partly to furnish, we believe, a bottle
of champagne to the thirsty orator in case
he should happen to call for one betwixt
his slumbers (at least we heard so a long
while ago, and it was quite in keeping with



          <pb id="p.261" n="261"/>

his noble host's hospitality; but we forgot
to verify the anecdote on this occasion) and
partly (of this there is no doubt) to secure
the bed curtains from being set on fire by
his candle.
 </p><p> A pleasanter apartment to contemplate,
is the one in which Lord Holland used
to hear his children say their lessons, and
induct them into the beauties of Spenser-an unexpected trait in the predilections of a
man of letters brought up in the town tastes
of the eighteenth century.  But his uncle
Charles was fond of Spenser; and so was
Burke, and the great Earl of Chatham.
It is difficult to hinder great men from
discerning the merits of greatness.  The
poetry of Spenser was to their other books
what their parks and retirements were to the
town itself.
 </p><p> The library must originally have been a


<pb id="p.262" n="262"/>

green-house or conservatory; for, in its first
condition, it appears to have been scarcely
anything but windows; and it is upwards
of ninety feet long, by only seventeen feet
four inches wide, and fourteen feet seven
inches in height. The moment one enters it,
one looks at the two ends, and thinks of the
tradition about Addison's pacings in it to
and fro.  It represents him  as meditating
his " Spectators " between two bottles of wine,
and comforting his ethics by taking a glass
of each, as he arrived at each end of the
room. The regularity of this procedure is,
of course, a jest; but the main circumstance
is not improbable, though Lord Holland
seems to have thought otherwise.  He says
(for the words in Faulkner's Kensington are
evidently his): " Fancy may trace the exquisite humour which enlivens his papers to the
mirth inspired by wine; but there is too




     <pb id="p.263" n="263"/>

much sober, good sense in all his lucubrations, even when he indulges most in pleasantry, to allow us to give implicit credit to
a tradition invented, probably, as excuse for
intemperance by such as can empty two
bottles of wine, but never produce a 'Spectator'
or a Freeholder." We shall return to Addison's alleged habit of drinking by and by.
 </p><p> The first Lord Holland made a family portrait gallery of this room; but the accumulated books of the late Lord forced the
pictures into other apartments, though still
he put many portraits above them, of friends,
kinsfolk, and deceased men of letters, with
Addison at their head.  When we lately saw
the room, there were no pictures at all; and
the ceiling had been converted into a starry
firmament; hardly, perhaps, the most suitable
thing, either to the ceiling itself, which is
full of concavities, or to the winter's enjoyment



<pb id="p.264" n="264"/>

 of a book by the fireside. But the
alterations of the house, we believe, are not
yet final; and everybody surely would miss
the presence of Addison.
 </p><p> The collection of books is celebrated for
its abundance of Italian and Spanish authors,
the former in particular. Among the curiosities in other languages are an "Editio
Princeps" of Homer, which belonged to
Fox; a copy of the same poet belonging
to Sir Isaac Newton, with a distich in his
handwriting on the fly-leaf; and a singularly interesting one of Camoens, which it is
alleged must have been in the hands of the
poet himself. At the bottom of the titlepage is a painful corroboration of the statements respecting his end. It is a manuscript
note in an old Spanish hand, stating, that
the writer " saw him die in a hospital, without even a blanket to cover him." "He



    <pb id="p.265" n="265"/>

did this," says he, "after having triumphed
in the East (Camoens served in various
expeditions), and traversed five thousand five
hundred leagues of ocean: and all for what,
but to study day and night to no better
purpose than spiders to catch flies ?"
 </p><p> A natural question enough to the first
impulse of indignation. And the blush of
Portugal at the fate of Camoens ought to
be as great and lasting, as the glory with
which he has covered her. But the death
of a man is not his life; nor must the
struggles of a poet make us forget his enjoyments. Camoens triumphed with his fellow-soldiers; was long the admiration of the
   circles in which he moved; knew the glory
   which awaited his name; and above all, must
   have  so loved and enjoyed his gift of poetry,
that in all probability, during the far greater
part  of his life, he would not have changed






<pb id="p.266" n="266"/>

lots with the most prosperous man in his
country. His end, indeed, is most pitiable,
enough to bring tears into the eyes of the
gallantest fellow-soldier.  It is said, that
before he was taken to the hospital, a faithful servant used actually to go out and beg
for him. It requires all the good and all
the pleasure given to the world by such men's
productions, to enable us to think of their
sufferings with patience. But it does enable
us. The ways of Providence are vindicated.
The fine heart is broken; but the earth, to
all time, is filled with its fragrance.
  </p><p> There are several curious manuscripts in
the library, particularly three autograph letters of Petrarch, three autograph plays of
Lope de Vega, the original copy of a play
of the younger Moratin, and the music of
Metastasio's "Olimpiade" beautifully written out by Jean Jacques Rousseau, at the


       <pb id="p.267" n="267"/>

  time when that "shaker of the thrones of
  Europe" got his livelihood by work of that
  kind.
   </p><p> It is by no means the least interesting
  circumstance connected with this library,
  that Lord Holland, its collector, really enjoyed his books. The reader might guess
  as much from the nature of them; and we
  shall have reasons for being assured of it as
  we go. At present, we have more to do
  with  the house than with its possessors.
  The collection of pictures is not remarkable, except as containing a greater number
  of portraits of men  of letters, Italians in
          particular, than is to be found perhaps in
any other private abode.  Among them    is
Addison, when he was young (a handsome
         face); Alfieri (in miniature), the Italian tragic
      poet, who was some time in England; his
      wife (another miniature), the Countess of




<pb id="p.268" n="268"/>
Albany, widow of the Pretender (a princess
of the house of Stolberg); Sir Philip
Francis; Robespierre (miniature), with his
pert, insignificant look, on which nobody
would have guessed that so much tragedy
was hanging; Jerome Bonaparte (a narrowminded, repulsive countenance); two portraits, large and small, if we mistake not,
of the <persName key="Duchess of Portsmouth">Duchess of Portsmouth</persName> (Louise de
Querouaille, Charles the Second's mistress),
quite making out, in one of them, the
"baby face" of which Evelyn accuses her,
nobody would have taken her for an ancestress of the manly-visaged Foxes; many
portraits of the rest of the family; a fine
one of Talleyrand, by Schetter; and one, by
Gerard, of Napoleon at Fontainebleau.
 </p><p> There are also busts of <persName key="Napoleon">Napoleon</persName>, of
Machiavel, and of Henry the Fourth, the
last "looking like a goat ;" a curious paint-ing





   <pb id="p.269" n="269"/>

 by Sir Joshua (of which more by-and-bye), consisting of whole-length portraits of
Charles Fox, when a youth, with his fair

whom is a grand-niece of <persName key="Newton, Sir Isaac">Sir Isaac Newton</persName>, whose bust is on the chimney-piece.
The play was performed for the amusement
of the Duke of Cumberland, who is seated
accordingly; and the governess playing with
one of the children is Lady Deloraine, whom
the reader will find acting a more curious
part, when we come, in these <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>

<p>We now come, not onlyt ot he possessors of the present house, but to those of the one that preceeded it; and therefore must go

<pb id="p.271" n="271"/>
a good way back, before we return to the Foxes.</p>
<p>We have seen, in a former chapter, that, with the exception of an Anglo-Saxon in the time of <persName key="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</persName>, of whom nothing further is mentioned, and of the Bishop of Coutances, to whom <persName key="William the Conqueror">William the Conqueror</persName> gave it with power to alienate; the De Veres, Earl of Oxford, were the earliest recorded possessors of the manor of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, and seated probably on the spot in question. IT is no ascertained that such was the case; but as the property was valuable , was convenient for its neighborhood to London, and seems to be implied as residential in the name of the adjoining locality, Earl's Court, that is to say, the course for administering the Earl's property or jurisdiction, it is extremely improbably that none of the




<pb id="p.272" n="272"/>

family ever occupied it.  It was associated
with their name from the time of<persName key=" William
the Conqueror"> William
the Conqueror</persName> to that of <persName key="James the First">James the First</persName>.
Aubrey de Vere, its first holder under the
Bishop, must needs have visited his property some time or other, or for what did
he come with the Conqueror into England ?
The ancient manor-house that stood not far
from the present <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, must have
been built for somebody; and visions of
Aubrey and his successors, however transient, naturally present themselves to the
eye of the local antiquary.
</p><p>  This Aubrey de Vere came from Holland with the first William, as countrymen
of his did afterwards with William the
Third. He died, however, a monk; perhaps out of penitence for the wrongs which
he had committed as a soldier. The title
of Earl of Oxford came into the family with




        <pb id="p.273" n="273"/>

 his grandson.   Almost all his successors
 were stirring soldiers and influential subjects.
 One of them was a Magna Charta baron;
 another a commander at the battles of
 Cressy and Poitiers; another at Agincourt;
 another was the great lord who received
 Henry the Seventh at his house with such
 a magnificent show of retainers, and who,
 notwithstanding his having been one of the
chief instruments in setting that moneyscraper on the throne, was fined by his
 sharp-eyed and shabby visitor, for entertaining him at a cost beyond the law.
  </p><p>  The family branched out into congenial
worthies, a daughter of one of whom, the
"starry Vere" of some noble verses by
  </p><p>   Marvell, was the Lady Fairfax, who gave
 that brave contradiction, in  Westminster
  </p><p>  Hall, to the assertion that all the people of
England were indicters of <persName key="Charles the First">Charles the First</persName>;



<pb id="p.274" n="274"/>

"No! not the hundredth part of them."
In short, the word Vere was almost synonymous in English history with whatsoever
was noble and dignified, when in its twentieth Earl of Oxford, it came to a sorry end
in the person of a profligate time-server,
who accommodated himself to every Court in
succession-Tory, Commonwealth, and Whig,
and who crowned his anti-heroical achievements by cheating an actress with a false
marriage.
 </p><p>  The <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> property, however, was
saved  the disgrace of belonging to this
scoundrel; for he died long after it had
been carried, by a co-heiress, into the
families of Argyle and others, who sold
it to<persName key=" Cope, Sir Walter "> Sir Walter Cope</persName>, the builder of Holland
House.
</p><p>   But before we part with the Veres, we
have a quarrel to pick with the whole of




    <pb id="p.275" n="275"/>

them, or rather with their name, and with
the Vere, whoever he was, who first gave
them  their motto, Vero Nihil Verius-Nothing truer than true; that is to say,
pun-ically speaking, Nothing more veritable
than Vere.  For the fact is, saving their
lordships' valours (and we think we see their
dust redden as we say it-but it is the
inventor's fault, not ours) the motto is a lie.
Vere does not mean "true."    The family
came from Holland; the word in Dutch
is written Weer; it is the name of the
place in the isle of Walcheren, which the
owners quitted for drier quarters; and the
word means neither more nor less than the
same word in English, -weir or wear; that
is to say, a dam, fish-trap, or flood-gate.
"Aubrey de Vere" is as fine an aristocratical
sound as can well be imagined, and it is
a pity to spoil it; but truth must be told.






<pb id="p.276" n="276"/>

Aubrey de Vere means Aubrey of the
dam, fish-trap, or flood-gate. Amicus Vere,
sed magis amica veritas. The inventor of
the motto, had he loved the truth as much
as he did a pun, should have taken a dam
for his crest, with the words Verus Bataviniter-True as I'm a Dutchman.
 </p><p>  In short, the Veres originated with the
coasters or others, whoever they were, a
hardy, painstaking race, ancestors of the
Vandykes and Vandammes,-who, according
to the witty poet, fished up Holland out of
the sea, and who obtained distinction with
one another, in proportion to their success in
the invention of shovels, and consolidations
of a ditch.
</p><p>
  <quote rend="blockquote"> "For as with pigmies, who best kills the crane,
   Among the hungry who best treasures grain,
   Among the blind the one-eyed blinkard reigns,
   So rules among the drowned he that drains.

           <pb id="p.277" n="277"/>

     Not who first sees the rising sun, commands;
     But who could first discern the rising lands:
     Who best could know to pump an earth so leak,
     Him they their lord and country's father speak:
     To make a bank was a great plot of state;-
     Invent a shovel, and be a magistrate."
</quote>

 </p><p>   It may be added, to complete the notice
of the Veres, that the present represention
of the race is in the Beauclerk family, the
daughter of the last lord having married
the first Duke of St. Albans, the son of
<persName key="Charles the Second">Charles the Second</persName> by Nell Gwynn. The
two fathers, it is to be feared, helped to spoil,
for a time, the blood of the actress; for
Sidney Beauclerk, their grandson (father of
Johnson's Topham Beauclerk), is said to have
been  as great a "raf"    as either of them,
without inheriting   any of the    royal wit.
This could not be said of Topham, however he might have resembled the king in




<pb id="p.278" n="278"/>

more respects than one; for though Johnson,
in one of the most extraordinary compliments on record, told him "his body was
all vice," he added that " his mind was all
virtue;" a combination of totals which, to
the Doctor's surprise, Beauclerk did not
seem happy to admit. Something of such
a mixture of extremes is, however, not
impossible as the world goes; so here, we
are to imagine, was a blink of the "starry
Vere"   shining  on   the  mud   of  the
debauchees.
 </p><p>  But we are losing sight of <placeName key="Holland
House">Holland
House</placeName>. <persName key=" Cope, Sir Walter "> Sir Walter Cope</persName>, the purchaser of
the Vere property in <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName>, seems to
have been one of the money-getters, who
profited by the endeavours which James the
First made to supply his lavish exchequer
without the help of a Parliament. He built
the house, or rather the main body of the

      <pb id="p.279" n="279"/>

house (the centre and turrets), about the year
sixteen hundred and seven, and bequeathed
it to <persName key="Rich, Henry Earl of Hollan">Henry Rich, Earl of Holland</persName>, as the
husband of his daughter and heiress, Isabella.
The wings and arcades were added by the
earl.
 </p><p>  This Earl of Holland was the younger son
of Robert Rich, first Earl of Warwick, by
Penelope, daughter of Queen Elizabeth's
Earl of Essex, the Stella of Sir Philip
Sidney. He was a handsome, showy man;
was a favourite with James's favourite, the
Duke of Buckingham; and had the reputation of being more than in the good graces
of Charles the First's queen; probably on no
other ground than the fact of his having fetched
her as a bride from <placeName key="France">France</placeName>, and been coxcombical in his attentions on the way.
 </p><p>  He and his friend, Hay, Earl of Carlisle,
were the twin stars of the great world, next






<pb id="p.280" n="280"/>

after their patron Buckingham; and Holland
House, during the prosperous portion of
Rich's career, must have entertained in its
saloons all the rank and fashion of the time.
Among     others  came   Bassompierre,    the
French Ambassador, who      with the dandy
indifference of his countrymen respecting
the orthographies of other countries, or

  </p><p> Unfortunately, Rich's coxcombry made
him over-sensitive to what he thought attentions or the reverse from ruling powers, and
in the Civil Wars he went to and fro in his
partizanship with so provoking a caprice, now
playing the part of a knight-errant for king
and queen, and now sulking at Holland
House and receiving visits from the disaffected for some imaginary affront, that when
the Parliament at last seized him and put
him to death for making a stand against the
death of the king, his end was a grief to
nobody.  Foppish to the last, he died in a
white satin waistcoat, and a cap ditto with
silver lace.
</p><p> Five months after the earl's execution,
<placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> was occupied by the Parliamentary General Fairfax, husband of the
"starry Vere," who thus found herself,
under very extraordinary circumstances, contemplating







<pb id="p.282" n="282"/>

the property of her ancestors.
A journal of the day says, "The Lord
General (Fairfax) is removed from Queen
Street to the late Earl of Holland's house
at Kensington, where he intends to reside."
(This Queen Street is the present Queen
Street in Lincoln's Inn Fields, then one
of the most fashionable quarters in London.)  It was at this period we are to
suppose Cromwell and Ireton conferring on
the lawn.
 </p><p>   The mansion, however, was soon restored
to the earl's widow and her children; and
from that time it remained quietly in the
possession of the family, almost as long as
they lasted.  The earl and his wife, like
the extinguished court, had been friends of
the drama; and for a few days during the
first establishment of the republic, and a
longer period in the reign of Cromwell,


    <pb id="p.283" n="283"/>

the players, who had been great loyalists,
and who contrived to perform secretly now
and then at noblemen's houses, where
purses were  collected for  their benefit,
found special encouragement in the house
before us.
</p><p>   From  the Restoration  to the time of
the Georges, <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> appears to
have been let by the noble owners on short
leases, and to a variety of persons; sometimes in apartments to lodgers; or, more
probably, a friend was now and then accommodated for nothing.  Among these various
occupants, the duration of whose abodes in
the house is unknown, the names of the
following have transpired:-
  </p><p> Arthur Annesley, first Earl of Anglesea,
so created by Charles the Second. He had
been  President of the   Council at the
close  of the Protectorate, and   opened






<pb id="p.284" n="284"/>

the  correspondence  with  the  restored
King.
 </p><p>  <persName key="Chardin, Sir John">Sir John Chardin</persName>, the traveller. He was
a French Protestant, and a jeweller.  He
settled in England, and was knighted by
Charles the Second; probably by way of
payment on account, for some bill sent in
and delivered to Madame the Duchess of
Portsmouth, of Cleveland, or of Mazarin.
 </p><p>  The fantastical Duchess of Buckinghamshire -  Catharine  Darnley -  illegitimate
daughter of James the Second, who took
upon her the state of a princess. Her first
husband was one of the Anglesea family
just mentioned.
 </p><p>  From a passage in one of the letters of
his daughter, Mrs. Morice, it is not improbable that 'the famous Jacobite bishop,
Atterbury, who was very intimate with the
duchess, had once apartments in this house.


    <pb id="p.285" n="285"/>

It is certain that his daughter and her husband lived there; for some of their letters
to the bishop, ranging over a space of
several years, are dated from it. This is the
daughter, whose going to meet him in
exile, and meeting him only to die, has
given so affecting a turn to the last days of
the proud and turbulent prelate. He appears
to have been a loving father.    Atterbury's
books were preserved in <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>
during his exile, and apartments were kept
ready for him  by  Mr. Morice, in case of
his return.
 </p><p>   But the most interesting of the temporary lodgers in <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName> was
Morice's friend Shippen, the famous Jacobite, immortalised by Pope for his sincerity.

none but the stupid kept away.

 </p><p>  Very different persons, however, were
honest Will Shippen and unprincipled William Yonge, of whom <persName key="Walpole, Sir Robert">Sir Robert Walpole</persName>
said,  that "nothing but his talents could

but his character have kept down his

Marvell, nor on minor points, perhaps,
so uncompromising, he was nevertheless to
the Whigs of the reign of George the
First what Marvell had been to the Tories
of Charles and James-the eloquent, witty,
open-hearted, and upon the whole, incorruptible  partisan.  When asked how he
should vote, he would say, "I cannot tell
until I hear from   Rome."    At Rome
resided the Pretender.  <persName key="Walpole, Sir Robert">Sir Robert Walpole</persName>
observed of him, and of Parliament in
general, "I will not say who are to be
corrupted, but I will say who is incorruptible; and that is Shippen."  Shippen, in
turn, would say of Sir Robert, " Robin and
I are two honest men.    He is for King
George, and I for King James; but those
men with the long cravats (meaning Sandys,
Rushout, and others) they only desire places,
either under King George or King James."


<pb id="p.288" n="288"/>
  He was sent to the Tower for saying of
King George (who could not speak English),
that "the only infelicity of His Majesty's
reign was, that he was unacquainted with
our language and constitution." Both sides
of the House wished him to soften the
expression, but he declined. The Prince of
Wales, afterwards George the Second, who
was at variance with the King, sent a
person to him with the offer of a thousand pounds (as a "convenience," we suppose, during his imprisonment); but it was
not to be expected that he who would not
alter his words for love, would do it for
money.
 </p><p>  <persName key="Walpole, Sir Robert">Sir Robert Walpole</persName> intercepted a letter
written to Shippen by the Pretender, and put it,
himself, into his hands.  It must have
been of a description more than usually
perilous, considering how openly Shippen


   <pb id="p.289" n="289"/>

talked of his correspondence with the exile.
Sir Robert took the opportunity of saying,
that he did not expect to alter the other's
sentiments, but would hope for his support
in case of being  personally attacked.  To
this Shippen agreed, but remained in all
other respects the same man.    He   was
son of a country clergyman, and possessed
a  moderate  independence;   but latterly
married  a  Northumberland  heiress, who
turned out unworthy of him. He appears,
however, to have had a regard for her relations, for he generally spent his summer
with them. At other times, he resided sometimes at <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, and sometimes at
Richmond; and he lived for many years in
Norfolk Street, in the Strand.
 </p><p>  Shippen is said to have been a forcible,
and even vehement speaker, pouring out
his words too rapidly; though at the same





<pb id="p.290" n="290"/>

time he was accustomed to speak low, and
to "hold his glove before his mouth"-a
curious trait in the bearing of so earnest a
man.  It looked as if he was conscious of
wanting a screen, though determined to disregard it; and, in fact, he appears to have
been in the habit of taking away his glove at
particular points, and throwing out his words
with great animation.  He wrote   verses;
but they were less poetical than to the
purpose.
  </p><p>  In  sixteen  hundred  and  eighty-nine,
 <persName key="King William  the Third">King William  the Third</persName> went to look at
 <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, with the view of taking it;
 but he preferred the house of the Earl of
 Nottingham, which thus became the Palace.
 The preference could hardly have been on
 account of the size; for he might have enlarged the one house as he did the other.
 Probably, however, the rooms were larger in
        <pb id="p.291" n="291"/>

the Nottingham House and so were better
to begin with. Perhaps also, William did
not find the grounds about <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>
flat enough to suit his Dutch predilections.
  </p><p> To return to the owners of the mansion
which had thus been successively occupied:
nothing seems known of Robert, second Earl
of Holland, who had quietly succeeded his
father, except that, in failure of the elder
branch of the family, he also succeeded as
fifth Earl of Warwick, the title being thenceforth the conjoined one of Warwick and
Holland.
 </p><p>  His son and successor, Edward, married
Charlotte, daughter of <persName key="Myddleton, Sir Thomas">Sir Thomas Myddleton</persName>, of Chirk Castle in the county of Flint;
a lady, whose name and origin we mention,
because after the Earl's death she became
the wife of Addison. Edward Henry, her



<pb id="p.292" n="292"/>

son, the next earl, is the youth whose
statue in Kensington Church has been
noticed in a former chapter.  He was succeeded by another Edward, his kinsman;
and the daughter and only child of this
nobleman dying unmarried, the title became
extinct. This was in the year seventeen
hundred and fifty-nine.
 </p><p>  The house fell into the possession of
William Edwardes, a Welsh gentleman,
whose father had married the daughter of
the first Earl of Warwick and Holland, and
who, in the year seventeen hundred and
seventy-six, was created Baron Kensington;
but fourteen years previous he had sold the
family mansion to the first Lord Holland of
the Fox family, by whom the title had been
consequently allowed to be taken; and in the
possession  of this distinguished  race  it
remains.

 <p>  ADDISON, notwithstanding the popularity
of the Foxes, is still the greatest celebrity of
<placeName key="Holland   House">Holland   House</placeName>.     His death in it is its
greatest event.  Places in the vicinity are
named after him; and the favourite record
of its library is the tradition, before mentioned,

      <pb id="p.295" n="295"/>

of the bottle of wine at each end of it,
by which he is said to have refreshed his
moralities, while concocting their sentences
to and fro.  It is added, unfortunately, that
he drank the more because he was unhappily
married.
  </p><p> The question upon this point is still discussed, and will probably never be settled.
The received opinion is, that Addison's marriage with the Countess of Warwick originated in his being tutor to her son; that the
Countess became ashamed of it, as a descension
from her rank; and that their lives were rendered unhappy in consequence. The prevalence
of this opinion appears to have been owing to
Johnson's Lives of the Poets, in which the
case is stated with so evident a willingness
to believe it, that people in general, who are
ready enough to fall in with such an inclination, have overlooked the manifest assumptions



<pb id="p.296" n="296"/>

 on which it is founded, and the " saids"
and " perhapses," with which it is qualified.
Setting aside higher points of view on such
questions, there is, in fact, no proof that
Addison was tutor to the young Earl, or that
the Countess felt any regret for the marriage
on the score of rank. Tutorship, had he been
a tutor, need not have hindered him from
making a pleasant husband. Tutors have
married highly, before and since, and become
lords and archbishops; and though the lady
was a countess by marriage, her birth was
but that of a baronet's daughter, which put
no such vast difference between her and the
son of a dean (for such was the father of
Addison). The truth of the matter we take
to have been, that the match was unsuitable
on very ordinary grounds.  The lady was
well and merry; the gentleman fit only to
muse.   Addison died at the end of three

    <pb id="p.297" n="297"/>

years.  And hence (as Johnson would have
been the first to say, had anybody provoked
him to differ with the other opinion)-hence
all this mighty fuss, Sir, about a tutor, and a
countess, and the punctilios of rank.
 </p><p>  Mighty versions are often given to things
that have quite another significancy. It has
been questioned of late under what real
impulse another circumstance occurred, which
is connected with Addison and Holland
House. We allude to the famous words
which he is said to have addressed in his
last moments to the young Earl of Warwick;
-" See in what peace a Christian can die."
The story originated with Young, who said
he had it from Tickell; adding, that the Earl
led an irregular life, which Addison wished
to reclaim. But according to Malone, who
was a scrupulous inquirer, there is no evidence of the Earl's having led any such life;



<pb id="p.298" n="298"/>

and Walpole, in one of his letters that were
published not long ago, startled-we should
rather say, shocked-the world, by telling
them that Addison "died of brandy."  It is
acknowledged by his best friends, that the
gentle moralist, whose bodily temperament
was as sorry a one as his mind was otherwise,
had gradually been tempted to stimulate it
with wine, till he became intemperate in the
indulgence.  It is impossible to say what
other stimulants might not gradually have
crept in; nor is it improbable that, during
the patient's last hours, the physician himself
might have ordered them. Sustainments of
that kind, in dying moments, are frequently,
and except in the opinion of superstition, very
properly administered; generally, out of pure
humanity; often in order to enable the sufferer
to speak his last words, which may be of great
importance. He may take the stimulant without



    <pb id="p.299" n="299"/>

knowing what it is; may suppose it to
be one of those divine medicines with which
God has been pleased to endow herb and
mineral, sometimes even poison; and, indeed,
there is no poison, nor dangerous distillation
of anything, which is not a divine medicine,
if used, instead of abused. Addison, therefore, may have had the stimulus given him,
whatever it was, not because it was a habit
which he could not leave off, and so " died of
it," but because, like many a sober man
before him, he had not strength enough to
speak without it. Again, he might or might
not have known anything of the nature of
the draught, yet still have regarded his
peace of mind as a thing apart from the
composure of his nerves, and justly founded
on what had been a conviction of his life.
Nay, supposing him even to have died as
Walpole asserts, he might still have regarded


<pb id="p.300" n="300"/>

that conviction  as a   thing  triumphant
over the nerves themselves, and over the very
inefficacy of the draught; he might have said
to himself, " Nothing can compose me longer,
but my belief in my religion. Let me show
in this last trial, how tranquillising it can
be." It is in vain that we fancy the light
spirit of Walpole laughing at us for these
considerations-saying to us, " Oh, what need
of words ? He died drunk and maudlin, and
there's an end."  We cannot thus consent to
think the worst, instead of best, of a man
who has given the world so much instruction
and entertainment, and whose Christianity,
at all events, was of a kind superior to vulgar
intolerances, and disposed to think the best
of most things. No: if Addison spoke the
words, which it is very likely he did, his
mistake was (for we still think he committed
a mistake) in rendering his religious convictions

        <pb id="p.301" n="301"/>

 liable to the charge of egotism, and
countenancing the assumption, that no others
could enable a man to die as peaceably as
himself.  For to assume this, involves an imputation against the divine government, and
the death-beds of good men in all regions of
the world. Besides, good men, with tender
consciences, may sometimes die less peaceably
than men who are not so good; so that on
every account it is best, upon the whole, that
all such exhibitions of self-complacency be
avoided, and the pious mortal, whatever be
his particular mode of faith, be content to die
in that spirit of resignation to heaven, and
interchange of comfort with those about him,
which is common to good people of all faiths.
 </p><p>  Good words are good things; yet good
deeds are better. Addison, we doubt not,
had his rights of comfort from both; yet
there is one thing which we could have




<pb id="p.302" n="302"/>

preferred his doing in his last hours, to anything which he may have said. It is the
amends which, for some mysterious reason
or other, he said he would have made to Gay,
" if he lived." The story, as related by Pope,
is, that "a fortnight before Addison's death,
Lord Warwick came to Gay, and pressed him,
in a very particular manner, to go and see
Mr. Addison, which he had not done for a
great while. Gay went, and found Addison
in a very weak way. Addison received him
in the kindest manner, and told him that he
had desired this visit to beg his pardon; that
he had injured him greatly; but that, if he
lived, he should find that he would make it
up to him. Gay, on his going to Hanover,
had great reasons to hope for some good preferment; but all those views came to nothing.
It is not impossible but that Mr. Addison
might prevent them, from his thinking



     <pb id="p.303" n="303"/>

Gay too well with some of the former
ministry. He did not at all explain himself in what he had injured him; and Gay
could not guess at anything else in which he
could have injured him so considerably." Now
it surely would have been better, if instead
of stopping at Gay's pardon of him, which of
course the good-natured poet heartily gave
(we fancy we see him coming out of <placeName key="Holland
House">Holland
House</placeName> with the tears in his eyes), Addison
had followed it up with making the amends
while he could; or, better still, had he
secured the amends beforehand, in order to
warrant his asking the pardon. It may be
said, that he might have been unable. He
might so. But still he might have given
proofs that he had done his best.
 </p><p>  Addison, it must be owned, did not shine
during his occupation of <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>.
He married, and was not happy: he was





<pb id="p.304" n="304"/>

made Secretary of State, and was not a good
one; he was in Parliament, and could not
speak in it; he quarrelled with, and even
treated contemptuously, his old friend and
associate, Steele, who declined to return the
injury.  Yet there, in <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, he
lived and wrote, nevertheless, with a literary
glory about his name which never can desert
the place; and to <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, while he
resided in it, must have come all the distinguished men of the day; for though a
Whig, he was personally " well in," as the
phrase is, with the majority of all parties.
He was in communication with Swift, who
was a Tory, and with Pope, who was neither
Tory nor Whig. It was now that the house
and its owners began to appear in verse.
Rowe addressed stanzas to Addison's bride;
and Tickell after his death touchingly
apostrophizes the place:

          <pb id="p.305" n="305"/>

 "Thou hill, whose brow the antique structures grace,
 Rear'd by bold chiefs of Warwick's noble race;
 Why, once so loved, whene'er thy bower appears,
 O'er my dim eyeballs glance the sudden tears ?"

(that is a good and true line.)
</p><p>
<quote rend="blockquote">" How sweet were once thy prospects, fresh and fair,
  Thy sloping walks and unpolluted air!
  How sweet the gloom beneath thy aged trees !"
</quote>
  </p><p> It seems to have been in <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>
(for he died shortly afterwards) that Addison
was visited by Milton's daughter, when he
requested her to bring him some evidences of
her birth. The moment he beheld her, he
exclaimed,   "Madam, you       need   no  other
voucher; your face is a sufficient testimonial
whose daughter you are." It must have been
very pleasing to Addison to befriend Milton's
daughter; for he had been the first to popularize the great poet by his critiques on
" Paradise  Lost," in   the "Spectator."




<pb id="p.306" n="306"/>

 </p><p>  Besides <placeName key="Holland House">Holland House</placeName>, Addison possessed
a mansion of his own at Bilton, in Warwickshire, which was afterwards occupied by his
daughter, who lived to a great age.  He deserved to possess a good house and grounds;
for he understood the elegancies of such
things, and the tranquil pleasures of the
country. The illustrious inhabitant of <placeName key="Kensington">Kensington</placeName> watched with interest the improvement of the royal grounds, and was the first
to propose that " Winter Garden," to horticulturists in general, which we trust to see
realized, with such a world of other desirables,
in the new Crystal Palace.

MEMOIRS OF THE COURT &amp; CABINETS
                     OF GEORGE III.

                    OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.
 </p><p>   FROM THE TIMES, MAY 30th.--" These volumes consist, in the main,
 of letters written by the two brothers, Lord Grenville and Mr. T. Grenville, to their elder brother, the Marquis of Buckingham, for his information, as to the political circumstances of the time. In the two former
 volumes a great amount of curious gossip, and of valuable information,
 was contained relative to the formation of the Coalition Ministry, the
 King's illness in <date value="1788">1788</date>, and the early period of the war with revolutionary
 <placeName key="France">France</placeName>. Volumes 3 and 4 take up the tale where volumes 1 and 2 had
 left it; and herein we find a tolerably connected narrative of the many
 stirring historical events which occurred between <date value="1800">1800</date>, when Lord
 Grenville and Talleyrand were in correspondence respecting Bonaparte's
 proposals for peace, until the return of the King's malady in <date value="1810">1810</date>, and
 the debates in Parliament relative to the regency. The present collection
 is more valuable than the last, inasmuch as Lord Grenville, having
 attained higher dignity and experience, is a more dispassionate observer
 of passing events. Whoever would desire to read the running comments
 of so eminent and well informed a man as Lord Grenville, upon a decade
 so interesting as that of <date value="1800">1800</date>-10, would do well to consult these
 volumes. Lord Grenville was certainly among the most far-sighted men
 of his time; and to him, from the first, belongs the credit of appreciating truly Napoleon Bonaparte's position and designs. He did so even
 to a higher degree than Pitt; and it is most remarkable how far his
 predictions have been verified by the event, even when submitted to the
   sharp test of the judgment of posterity. The principal points on which
   light is thrown by the present correspondence are, the negotiations
   before and after the Treaty of Amiens until the time of its rupture-the
   true character of Addington's Administration, and the relations between
   "the Doctor" and Pitt-the formation of the Pitt and Sidmouth Cabinet,
   when the King's prejudices against Charles Fox were found to be insurmountable-the Grenville and Fox short Administration-the Duke of
   Portland's Cabinet-the expedition to  Portugal, with its climax at
   Cintra-the Duke of York's scandal with Mrs. Clarke-Sir John Moore's
   retreat, with the earlier Spanish campaigns of Sir Arthur Wellesley; and,
   finally, the disastrous ' Walcheren' affair. There is much curious matter
   interposed in the shape of precis upon the situation of affairs, written
   from time to time by Lord Grenville himself; and perhaps still more,
   curious reports made to the Marquis of Buckingham  by a certain - ,
   whose name remains a mystery, but who seems to have been tolerably
   well acquainted with the arcana imperii at the beginning of the century.
   There is much in these volumes which well deserves perusal. There is
   a portion of their contents which possesses nearly as high a claim upon





<pb id="p.ii" n="ii"/>
our instant and careful consideration as the Minutes of the Sebastopol
Committee."
  </p><p> FROM THE. ATHENEUM.-" THE present volumes exhibit the same
features as the former portion of the series. The general reader is entertained, and the reader for historical purposes is enlightened. Of their
value and importance, there cannot be two opinions. There are abundant
revelations of interest to arrest attention in many of these papers. On
the characters of George the Fourth and the Duke of Wellington, there
are some very valuable letters. In Court scandals, the affairs of the
Duke of York and Mrs Clarke are brought under notice; and in what
we may designate as public scandals, the ' horrors of routine' receive
abunduant illustrations in the letters about the Walcheren Expedition, and
on the Peninsular War. Our extracts sufficiently show the high interest
belonging to these volumes."
 </p><p>  FROM THE EXAMINER.-" These volumes worthily complete an undertaking which will earn for the Duke of Buckingham the thanks of not a few
historians. We have before us the secret movements of parties, the motives
of individuals, the minute anatomy of every political act and word laid bare.
All the town gossip has been preserved; we have innumerable authentic anecdotes, and full personal details about every person on the public stage,
and as for the King and his unhappy family, we have their sayings and
doings, their whims and blunders, and every scrap of scandal connected
with their domestic affairs, made out for nearly every day in every year."
 </p><p>  FROM THE SPECTATOR -" These volumes throw    new light on the
great subjects of the period. There is a good deal of interest in their
comments, especially on such matters as the Walcheren Expedition-Mrs. Clarke's exposure of the Duke of York-the intrigues of Canning,
who comes out badly-the behaviour of the Prince of Wales, who comes
out selfish, small. and false. The letters of the leading correspondents are
of a high class. The collection is well edited for popular purposes."
 </p><p>  FROM THE STANDARD.-" These volumes comprehend a period the
most important in the events relating to our domestic affairs and foreign
relations to be found in the British annals, told, not only by eye witnesses, but by the very men who put them in motion. The volumes now
published immeasurably exceed their predecessors in interest and importance. They must tind a place in the library of every English gentleman."
  </p><p> FROM THE OBSERVER.-" A more valuable addition to the political
literature of the country has not been produced for some time, than these
memoirs. They throw a flood of light upon the policy and conduct of
the successive governments of this country during the latter period of the
eventful reign of George III. They admit us into the secret arcana of
the actions and the motives of the principal actors in the great events
which took place, and while they afford some glimpses of noble and
heroic conduct, they expose a vast mass of that hollowness of profession,
and those selfish motives, which, by turns, animated and influenced the
conduct, of many of our public men. The opinions expressed, as well as
the facts stated, may be read with interest by all parties, and studied
with peculiar profit by the historian. The noble editor of these interesting volumes deserves the thanks of the public for the ability he has
displayed in arranging these valuable contributions to the political history
of our country."</p><p>

                        FROM THE "SUN."</title>
 </p><p>  "This work is a worthy companion to Miss Strickland's admirable
Queens' of England.' That celebrated work, although its heroines were,
for the most part, foreign Princesses, related almost entirely to the history
of this country. The Princesses of England, on the contrary, are themselves English, but their lives are nearly all connected with foreign
nations. Their biographies, consequently, afford us a glimpse of the
manners and customs of the chief European kingdoms, a circumstance
which not only gives to the work the charm of variety, but is likely to
render it peculiarly useful to the general reader, as it links together
by association the contemporaneous history of various nations.  We
cordially commend Mrs. Everett Green's production to general attention;
it is (necessarily) as useful as history, and fully as entertaining as
romance."
  </p><p>                   <title> FROM THE "BRITANNIA."</title>
  A most agreeable book, and a valuable addition to the historical
library."
 </p><p>                  <title> FROM THE "MORNING POST."</title>
  " The vast utility of the task undertaken by the gifted authoress of
this interesting book can only be equalled by the skill, ingenuity, and
research displayed in its accomplishment. The field Mrs. Green has
selected is an untrodden one."
  </p><p>             <title>FROM THE "GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE."</title>
  "Mrs. Green's research is the greatest of any historical writer of the
present day. Many of the lives relate to persons of whom our ordinary
historians have known absolutely nothing at all."
 </p><p>                   <title>FROM THE "JOHN BULL."</title>
  " A work of deep interest and importance, which will rank among the
most valuable contributions to the stores of English history.
  " We bring our remarks on this highly interesting biography to a close,
by expressing on behalf of the reading public our sense of the obligation
which the industrious and talented author has conferred on historical
literature by her admirable work."
 </p><p>                     <title>FROM THE "ATHENAEUM."</title>
  "In closing this last review of the work, we cannot finally part from
Mrs. Green without again bearing our testimony to the careful research
and diligent examination of authorities which each volume displays.
Along the line of six hundred years much incidental light has been
thrown, not only on English, but on Continental history; and as a
valuable contribution towards both we recommend these volumes."

 <p>HISTORY OF THE LANDED GENTRY.
                  A   Genealogical Dictionary
    OF THE WHOLE OF THE UNTITLED ARISTOCRACY OF
ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, AND IRELAND</p>
 <p>    Comprising Particulars of 100, 000 Individuals connected with them.

                BY SIR BERNARD BURKE,
                        Ulster King of Arms


  </p><p> A new and thoroughly revised Edition, to be completed in a single
volume, uniform with the Peerage and Baronetage (divided into four
parts, the first of which is now ready, price 10s. 6d.)

 </p><p>  N.B.-Communications and Corrections intended for this Work, are
requested to be addressed as soon as possible to Sir B. Burke, care of
the publishers, 13, Great Marlborough-street, London.

</p><p>
THE Landed Gentry of England are so closely connected with the
stirring records of its eventful history, that some acquaintance with
them is a matter of necessity with the legislator, the lawyer, the historical student, the speculator in politics, and the curious in topographical and antiquarian lore; and even the very spirit of ordinary
curiosity will prompt to a desire to trace the origin and progress of those
families whose influence pervades the towns and villages of our land.
This work furnishes such a mass of authentic information, in regard to
all the principal families in the kingdom, as has never before been attempted to be brought together.   It relates to the untitled families of
rank, as the "Peerage and Baronetage" does to the titled, and forms,
in fact, a peerage of the untitled aristocracy.  It embraces the whole of
the landed interest, and is indispensable to the library of every gentleman.

 </p><p>  A work of this kind is of a national value. Its utility is not merely temporary,
but it will exist and be acknowledged as long as the families whose names and genealogies are recorded in it continue to form an integral portion of the English constitution. As a correct record of descent, no family should be without it. The untitled
aristocracy have in this great work as perfect a dictionary of their genealogical history, family connexions, and heraldic rights, as the peerage and baronetage. It will
be an enduring and trustworthy record."-Morning Post.
 </p><p>  "A work in which every gentleman will find a domestic interest, as it contains the
fullest account of every known family in the United Kingdom. It is a dictionary of
all names, families, and their origin,-of every man's neighbour and friend, if not of
his own relatives and immediate connexions. It cannot fail to be of the greatest
utility to professional men in their researches respecting the members of different
families, heirs to property, &amp;c. Indeed, itwill become as necessary as a Diretory in
every office."--Bell's Messenger.</p>

                        Anecdotes and Records

           DISTINGUISHED FAMILIES.

                  BY SIR BERNARD BURKE.</p>
<p>
       A New and greatly Improved Edition, in 3 vols. post 8vo.



</p><p> THE memoirs of our great families are replete with details of the most
striking and romantic interest, throwing light on the occurrences of
public as well as domestic life, and elucidating the causes of many important national events; yet how little of the personal history of the
Aristocracy is generally known, and how        full of amusement is the
subject! Almost every eminent family has some event connected with
its rise or greatness, some curious tradition interwoven with its annals,
or some calamity casting a gloom over the brilliancy of its achievements, which cannot fail to attract the attention of that sphere of
society to which this work more particularly refers, and must equally
interest the general reader, for whom, in this country, the records of
the higher classes have always possessed a peculiar attraction. The
anecdotes of the Aristocracy here recorded, go far to show that there
are more marvels in real life than in the creations of fiction.  Let the
reader seek romance in whatever book, and at whatever period he may,
yet nought will he find to surpass the unexaggerated reality here
unfolded.
</p><p>
                   <title>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</title>
  "Sir Bernard Burke has here given us the most curious incidents, the most stirring
tales, and the most remarkable circumstances connected with the histories, public and
private, of our noble houses and aristocratic families, and has put them into a shape
which will preserve them in the library, and render them the favourite study of those
who are interested in the romance of real life. These stories, with all the reality of
established fact, read with as much spirit as the tales of Boccaccio, and are as full
of strange matter for reflection and amazement."-Britannia.
</p><p>   " The ' Romance of the Aristocracy' will be read from the palace to the hamlet;
and no one can rise from these volumes without deriving a useful knowledge of some
chapter of family history, each connected with one or other of the great houses of the
kingdom."-British Army  Despatch.
 </p><p>  " We cannot estimate too highly the interest of Sir Bernard Burke's entertaining
and instructive work. For the curious nature of the details, the extraordinary anecdotes related, the strange scenes described, it would be difficult to find a parallel for
it. It will be read by every one."--Sunday Times.
 </p><p>  " In these two volumes the indefatigable genealogist of the ancient families of the
kingdom has collected a variety of incidents from their history, which will go far to
establish the proposition that there is full as much romance in real life as in works
of fiction. Some of the facts here recorded have furnished materials for the use of
poets and novel-writers; while others are altogether new to the general reader, being
drawn forth from the more recondite stores of biography. The former will be
perused with interest on account of the historical fidelity of the narrative: to the
latter their very novelty imparts an additional charm."-John Bull.</p>

   <p>THE CRESCENT AND THE CROSS.

</p><p>                    <title>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</title>

 </p><p>                         <title> FROM THE "CRITIC."</title>
 "The new interest given to all that relates to Turkey and the East will doubtless
create a new demand for so clever a description of it as Mr. Warburton's ' Crescent
and the Cross,' whose popularity has been already attested by ten editions. The
eleventh now appears, and doubtless will be the most extensively bought of any of
them, for it is brought within the means of all classes by a great reduction in price."

                           <title> FROM THE "SUN."</title>
 </p><p>  "A book calculated to prove more practically useful was never penned than ' The
Crescent and the Cross'-a work which surpasses all others in its homage for the
sublime and its love for the beautiful in those famous regions consecrated to everlasting immortality in the annals of the prophets, and which no other modern writer
has ever depicted with a pencil at once so reverent and so picturesque."

</p><p>                     <title>   FROM THE "SPECTATOR."</title>
  " In the mixture of story with anecdote, information, and impression, it perhaps
surpasses ' Ethen.' Innumerable passages of force, vivacity, or humour are to be
found in the volumes."
  </p><p>                         <title>FROM THE "GLOBE."</title>
  "Mr. Warburton has fulfilled the promise of his title-page. The ' Realities' of
'Eastern Travel' are described with a vividness which invests them with deep and
abiding interest; while the 'Romantic' adventures which the enterprising tourist
met with in his course are narrated with a spirit which shows how much he enjoyed
these reliefs from the ennui of every-day life."

  </p><p>                 <title>FROM THE "QUARTERLY REVIEW."</title>
  "This is an account of a tour in the Levant, including Egypt, Palestine, Syria,
Constantinople, and Greece. The book is remarkable for the colouring power, and
the play of fancy with which its descriptions are enlivened .... The book, independently of its value as an original narrative, comprises much useful and interesting information."
  </p><p>                      <title> FROM THE "BRITANNIA."</title>
  " Mr. Warburton sees with the strong clear vision with which Heaven has endowed
him, but with this there are always blended recollections of the past, and something-though dashed in unconsciously-of poetic feeling. He brings to his work of observation an accomplished mind, and welltrained and healthful faculties. We are proud
to claim him as a countryman, and are content that his book shall go all the world
over, that other countries may derive a just impression of our national character. "

        </p><p>            <title>  FROM THE "COURT JOURNAL."</title>
  "We know no volumes furnishing purer entertainment, or better calculated to raise
up vast ideas of past glories and the present aspects of the people and lands of the
most attractive region of the world."
    </p><p>             <title>FROM THE "WEEKLY CHRONICLE."</title>
  "Of recent books of Eastern Travel, Mr. Warburton's is by far the best. He writes
like a poet and an artist, and there is a general feeling of bonhomie in everything he
says, that makes his work truly delightful."

                   THE IMMORTAL.

     </p><p>                 <title>FROM THE "ATHENEUM."</title>
  "A magnificent fiction. One of the most splendid productions among
works of fiction that the age has brought forth."
  </p><p>                <title>FROM THE "LITERARY GAZETTE."</title>
  " This extraordinary story, the production of a man of great genius,
cannot be classed with any of the works of imagination which have been
put forth in these times, so fertile in romance. It is perfectly original
in the general conception, as well as in its splendid and powerful eloquence."
  </p><p>            <title> FROM THE "GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE."</title>
  " We have risen from the perusal of the volumes before us, just as we
have felt after gazing on splendid pictures-listening to thrilling music,
or after losing ourselves, and all the sober realities of life, in the absorbing interest of Shakspeare's finest tragedy. Every page is instinct with
the energy of passion, or with some glowing picture of romantic grandeur-the tender, the affecting, and the pathetic-the ardent, the heroic,
the devoted-all that can excite the highest and most dramatic of our
feelings.
 </p><p>  "There is, we will venture to predict in ' Salathiel,' the germ of perpetuity; it is not destined, like other works of imagination, to be read
and forgotten."
  </p><p>                   <title> FROM THE "NEW TIMES."</title>
  " 'Salathiel' is destined to take a high rank in that class of literature
to which it belongs. The reader finds in every page, from the first to
the last, the power of a master, and the potency of the spell by which
his faculties are held in subjection."
 </p><p>                 <title>FROM THE "WEEKLY REVIEW."</title>
  "This is a work of very peculiar character. It is, in fact, the auto-biography of the Wandering Jew, and contains a history of the troubles,
insurrections, persecutions, &amp;c., which supervened in Judea, immediately after the death of Christ. Dr. Croly has well succeeded in
depicting the Jewish character and warfare; and has entered with considerable felicity into what it is probable would be the feelings of such a
being as the impious and miserable wanderer whose history he writes."</p>

  "After the manner of ' Childe Harolde,' a vivid sketch of European places, cities,

charm for the reader, it combines all the excellences of the original model with that
grace and flow characteristic of the author's peculiar taste and genius. .  .  We

  "Dr. Croly has only done justice to himself in putting his name to the wittiest
poem of its day. Throughout, the satire is sharp but not ill-natured; the reflections
deep, and the sketches of men, manners, and things, as true as if recorded by
a social and physical daguerreotype."

  </p><p>               <title> "NAVAL AND MILITARY GAZETTE."</title>
  "The ' Modern Orlando' is a series of adventures, exhibiting a kind of tour through
all the remarkable scenes and showy cities of Europe, interspersed with characteristic
stories and occasional sketches of the leading personages of the day.
 </p><p>  "Byronish in style, clever in its allusions, and impartial in its sarcasms, this
volume is now reproduced under the auspices of the author's own name. It com.
mands attention whilst it amuses, and is well deserving popularity."
