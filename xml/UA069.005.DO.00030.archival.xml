<p>THE drama was fairly supported in Queen Anne's time, although there were never more than three theatres open at once, and generally only two. It was not an age for either
-striking actors or immortal plays; but, as to the former, they were hard-working, and some of them have left a name behind them renowned in the history of the stage; and, for the latter, they were, although somewhat coarse in humour, not so licentious as the plays of the three preceding reigns. It is impossible, within the limits of this book, to do more than generalise on the drama of that day-its history has materials in it for a book to itself.</p>
<p>There were four theatres: Dorset Gardens, Lincoln's

<pb n="2" id="p.2"/> Inn Fields, Drury Lane, and the Queen's Theatre, Haymarket.
</p>  <p> <placeName key="Dorset Gardens Theatre">Dorset Gardens Theatre</placeName>
   was in <placeName key="Salisbury Court">Salisbury Court</placeName>, in
<placeName key="Salisbury Square">Salisbury Square</placeName>, <placeName key="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</placeName>, and was built, it is said, from designs by <name type="person" key="Wren, Sir Christopher">Sir Christopher Wren</name>, and to have been decorated by Grinling Gibbons. It fronted the river one way, was consequently easy of access by 'the silent highway,' and its facade was very pretty, although not elaborately ornamented. It was opened on <date value="1671-11-09">Nov. 9, 1671</date>, by the Duke of York's Company, when they left the playhouse in Little Lincoln's Inn Fields. It gradually got disreputable, and in <date value="1698">1698</date> was used for the drawing of a penny lottery. Ward thus describes its condition in his time. 'By this time we were come to our propos'd landing Place, when a Stately Edifice (the Front supported by Lofty Columns) presented to our View. I enquired of my Friend what Magnanimous Don Cressus Resided in this Noble and Delightful Mansion ? Who told me, No Body as he knew on, except Rats and Mice; and perhaps an old superannuated Jack Pudding, to look after it, and to take Care that no Decay'd Lover of the Drama should get in and steal away the Poet's Pictures, and sell 'em to some Upholsterers for Roman Emperours; I suppose there being little else to lose, except Scenes, Machines, or some such Jim Cracks. For this, says he, is one of the Theatres, but now wholly abandon'd by the Players; and 'tis thought, will in a little time be pull'd down.'<note place="foot" n="1">London Spy.</note>  The neighbourhood around about he describes as something awful in its character, and he was not particular to a shade.</p>
     <p>The following advertisement<note place="foot" n="2">Daily Courant, <date value="1703-04-30">April 30, 1703</date>.</note> will show the style of amusement it afforded its patrons:-
</p><p>     'Being the last time of Acting till after May Fair. At the Theatre in Dorset Gardens, this day being Friday the
30th of April will be presented A Farce call'd, The Cheats of Scapin. And a Comedy of two Acts only, call'd, The Comical Rivals, or the School Boy. With several Italian Sonatas by Signior Gasperini and others. And the Devonshire Girl, being now upon her Return to the City of Exeter, will perform three several Dances, particularly her last new Entry in


<pb n="3" id="p.3"/>
 imitation of Mademoiselle Subligni, and the Whip of Dunboyne by Mr. Claxton her Master, being the last time of their Performance till Winter. And at the desire of several Persons of Quality (hearing that Mr. Pinkeman hath hired the two famous French Girls lately arriv'd from the Emperor's Court) They will perform several Dances on the Rope upon the Stage, being improv'd to that Degree, far exceeding all others in that Art. And their Father presents you with the Newest Humours of Harlequin as perform'd by him before the Grand Signior at Constantinople. Also the Famous Mr. Evans lately arriv'd from Vienna, will shew you Wonders of another kind, Vaulting on the Manag'd Horse, being the greatest Master of that Kind in the World. To begin at Five so that all may be done by Nine a Clock.'</p>
    <p>In the Daily Courant May 13, <date value="1703">1703</date>, there was an attempt
 to revive it, but it was unsuccessful. 'The Queen's Theatre
 in Dorset Garden is now fitting up for a new Opera; and the
 great Preparations that are made to forward it and bring
 it upon the Stage by the beginning of June, adds to every
 body's Expectation, who promise themselves mighty Satisfaction from so well order'd and regular an Undertaking as
 this is said to be, both in the Beauties of the Scenes, and
 Varieties of Entertainments in the Musick and Dances.'</p>
 <p>   It opened spasmodically, now and then: on July 9, <date value="1706">1706</date>,
 with an opera called 'Arsinoe, Queen of Cyprus.' Mrs. Tofts
 as Arsinoe; a prologue spoken by Cibber, and an epilogue
 by Estcourt; and on Aug. I there was an opera called
 Camilla' played. And we hear the last of it in the autumn of
 this year. <note place="foot" n="3">  Daily Courant, Oct. 22, <date value="1706">1706</date>.</note> 'By the deserted Company of Comedians of the
 Theatre Royal. At the Queen's Theatre in Dorset Gardens,
 on Thursday next being the 24th of October, will be Acted
 a Comedy, call'd The RECRUITING OFFICER.<note place="foot" n="4">By George Farquhar.</note> In which they
 Pray there may be Singing by Mrs. Tofts in English and
 Italian.  And some dancing.' On the 30th they played
 ' Master Fido, or the Faithful Shepherd,' 'acted all by women'
 -a not absolute novelty, but which showed how hard up
 they were for something new to draw. And there were five
 more performances that year.
      </p>
<pb n="4" id="p.4"/>

   <p> But all attempts to galvanise it into life failed, and in the Daily Courant of June 1, <date value="1709">1709</date>, we read, 'The Play House at Dorset Stairs is now pulling down, where there is to be sold old Timber fit for Building or Repairs, Old Boards, Bricks, Glass'd Pantiles and Plain Tiles, also Fire Wood, at very reasonable rates.'</p>
   <p> Lincoln's Inn Fields was another theatre which had very varying fortunes during this reign. In <date value="1705">1705</date>, when the company left for their new home in the Haymarket, it was to let. Betterton took it for a night for his benefit on March 3 of that year, and Cave Underhill for his on March 31. It was not re-opened till Sept. 12, <date value="1706">1706</date>, and was played in only six nights that year. It was rebuilt by Rich, but was not again acted in during Queen Anne's reign.
 </p>  <p>One advertisement of its performances may be given as exemplifying their variety.<note place="foot" n="5">Daily Courant, June 8, <date value="1703">1703</date>.</note> 'At the Desire of several Persons of Quality. For the Benefit of Mrs. Prince. At the Theatre in Little Lincoln's Inn Fields, the present Tuesday being the 8th of June, will be presented the last New Tragedy call'd, The Fair Penitent.<note place="foot" n="6">By N. Rowe.</note>  With four Entertainments of Singing (entirely New) by the Famous Signiora Francisca Margarita de l'Epine; to which will be added the Nightingale Song <note place="foot" n="7">Can this be an early work of Carey's? See Appendix.</note>; it being the last time of her Singing whilst she stays in England. The Instrumental Musick composed by Signior Jacomo Greber. With a Country Wedding Dance by Monsieur Labbe, Mrs. Elford, and others. Also a new Entertainment of Dancing between Mazetin a Clown, and two Chairmen. With the Dance of Blouzabella by Mr. Prince, and Mrs. Elford. By reason of the Entertainments the Play will be shortened. Boxes 6s. Pit 4s. Gallery 2s. 6d' These seem to have been the benefit prices at this theatre, the normal ones being 5s., 3s., and 2s.
 </p><p>  Dorset Gardens and Lincoln's Inn Fields theatres were the dramatic failures; the 'Theatre Royal in Drury Lane,' as it was called, was an exception, and stood its ground fairly during the Queen's reign. It was built by Killigrew, at a cost of &#x00A3; 1,500, on the site of a plot of ground called the


<pb n="5" id="p.5"/>

' Riding Yard,' which was obtained on lease from the Duke of Bedford, and opened in <date value="1663">1663</date>. The actors there were called Her Majesty's servants, and had the right to dress in scarlet, the royal livery.</p>
   <p> In the summer time, when the quality was dispersed at the various Spas, the dramatic company followed them to their fashionable resorts, as also did Powell and Clinch. This, at all events, was the case in the early days of Anne's rule. ' Her Majesty's Servants of the Theatre Royal being return'd from the Bath, do intend, to morrow being Wednesday the Sixth of this instant October to act a Comedy call'd Love makes a Man, or, the Fop's Fortune.<note place="foot" n="8"> By Colley Cibber. </note> With Singing and Dancing. And whereas the Audiences have been incommoded by the Plays usually beginning too late, the Company of the said Theatre do therefore give Notice that they will constantly begin at Five a Clock without fail, and continue the same Hour all the Winter.' <note place="foot" n="9">Daily Courant, Oct. 5, <date value="1703">1703</date>.</note>
</p>   <p>Later in this reign they stopped in London, but did not play every day. 'Not Acted these 15 years. By Her Majesty's Company of Comedians. At the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, on Tuesday next, being the 1st of July, will be Reviv'd the 2nd Part of the Destruction of Jerusalem,<note place="foot" n="10">By J. Crowne, <date value="1677">1677</date>.</note> by Titus Vespasian. The Parts of Titus by Mr. Booth, Phraartes Mr. Mills, Tiberius Mr. Keen. John, Mr. Powell. Berenice Mrs. Rogers, Clarona Mrs. Bradshaw. N.B. The Company will continue to Act on every Tuesday and Friday during the Summer Season. By Her Majesty's Command<note place="foot" n="11"> See p. 10</note> no Persons are to be admitted behind the Scenes.' <note place="foot" n="12">Daily Courant, June 28, <date value="1712">1712</date>.
</note> At one time, as Cibber narrates, it was even closed altogether.
</p>   <p> The theatre was used occasionally for other than dramatic performances. Here is one: 'At the Theatre Royal in
<placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName>, this present Tuesday being the 14th of December will be perform'd, The Subscription Musick. Wherein Mrs. Tofts Sings several Songs in Italian and English. With a new piece of Vocal and Instrumental Musick never perform'd before, composed by Mr. Leveridge. And several new Entries and Entertainments of Dancing by Monsieur l'Abbe, Monsieur

<pb n="6" id="p.6"/>

 Du Ruell, Monsieur Charrier, Mrs. Campion, Mrs. Elford, the Devonshire Girl, and others. No Person to be admitted into the Pit or Boxes but by the Subscribers Tickets, which are deliver'd at Mr. White's Chocolate house. The Boxes on the Stage and the Galleries are for the Benefit of the Actors. The Stage Boxes 7s. 6d. the first Gallery 2s. 6d. the Upper Gallery 1s. 6d. To begin about Five a Clock. No Person to stand on the Stage.' <note place="foot" n="13">Daily Courant,Dec. 14, <date value="1703">1703</date>.</note>
   </p><p>That the ordinary prices, which they never advertised, were much lower than these, is shown by an advertisement in the following year. 'And by reason of the extraordinary Charge in the Decoration of it, the Prices will be rais'd. Boxes 5s. Pit 3s. First Gallery 2s. Upper Gallery 1s.'
   </p><p>Before quitting this short notice of <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName> Theatre reference must be made to an incident in which Mrs. Tofts the singer was interested. 'ANN Barwick having occasion'd a Disturbance at the Theatre Royal in <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName> on Saturday Night last the 5th of February, and being thereupon taken into Custody, Mrs. Tofts, in Vindication of her own Innocency, sent a Letter to Mr. Rich, Master of the said Theatre, which is as followeth.
</p><p>
   SIR, I was very much surpriz'd when I was inform'd, that Ann Barwick, who was lately my Servant, had committed a Rudeness last night at the Play-house, by throwing of Oranges, and hissing when Mrs. l'Epine the Italian Gentlewoman Sung. I hope no one can think that it was in the least with my Privity, as I assure you it was not. I abhor such Practises, and I hope that you will cause her to be prosecuted, that she may be punish'd as she deserves.
   </p><p>              I am, Sir, Your humble Servant,
                                    KATHARINE TOFTS.
   </p><p>To Christopher Rich Esq.; at the
      Theatre Royal. Feb. 6. 703.' <note place="foot" n="14">Ibid. Feb. 8 <date value="1704">1704</date>.</note>
</p><p>
   Misson gives a description of its interior, which, from his invariable truthfulness, can be relied on. 'The Pit is an



<pb n="7" id="p.7"/>
 Amphitheater, fill'd with Benches without Back boards, and adorn'd and cover'd with green Cloth. Men of Quality, particularly the younger Sort, some Ladies of Reputation and Vertue, and abundance of Damsels that hunt for Prey, Sit all together in this place, Higgledy piggledy, chatter, toy, play, hear, hear not. Farther up, against the Wall, under the first Gallery, and just opposite to the Stage, rises another Amphitheater, which is taken up by Persons of the best Quality, among whom are generally very few Men. The Galleries, whereof there are only two rows, are filled with none but ordinary People, particularly the Upper One.'
 </p><p>  Italian opera was coming mightily into vogue, but a new theatre was needed for its performance, so a company was formed, capital 3,000&#x00A3;. in 100&#x00A3;. shares, which covered a subscription for life; and Sir John Vanbrugh was entrusted with its building. The members of the Kitcat Club were large subscribers; and Cibber says, 'Of this Theatre I saw the first Stone laid, on which was inscrib'd The little Whig,<note place="foot" n="15">Lady Sunderland, second daughter of the Duke of Marlborough. See Vol. I. P. 28.</note> in Honour to a Lady of extraordinary Beauty, then the celebrated Toast and Pride of that Party.' But this seems an inaccuracy, for in a newspaper-cutting of March 19, <date value="1825">1825</date>,it says,' Removing that portion of the walls of the Italian Opera House, immediately adjoining the cellar of Mr. Wright, on Saturday last, the workmen discovered the first stone of the old building, laid in <date value="1704">1704</date>. The stone was in a perfect state, and in the cavity formed for the purpose of receiving them were found several coins of the reign of Queen Anne; a brass plate which covered the cavity bore the following inscription: " April 18,
<date value="1704">1704</date>. In the third year of the happy reign of our Sovereign Lady Queen Anne, this corner stone of the Queen's Theatre was laid, by his Grace Charles Duke of Somerset, Master of the Horse to her most sacred Majesty."'
 </p><p>  The outside was imposing: an arcade, as now, ran along the front of the building, the length of which was relieved by a dome in the centre, and on the balustraded parapet were eight statues on pedestals. But, if Cibber is to be trusted, the inside was so badly constructed acoustically that 'scarce

<pb n="8" id="p.8"/>
 one Word in ten could be distinctly heard in it,' and the consequence was that the roof had to be remodelled and made flat.</p>
   <p>Vanbrugh and Congreve opened this theatre on Easter Monday, April 9, <date value="1705">1705</date>, and Mrs. Bracegirdle spoke a prologue, written by Dr. Garth, in which are the lines, alluding to the Haymarket:-</p><p>
         <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Your own magnificence you here Survey,</l>
         <l> Majestick Columns stand where Dunghills lay,</l>
         <l> And Cars triumphal rise from Carts of Hay.</l></quote>

   </p><p>The play on this occasion was, according to Cibber, 'a translated Opera, to Italian Musick, called the Triumph of Love.' This, he says, only ran three days, and then Sir John Vanbrugh produced his comedy called 'The Confederacy.' Downes'<note place="foot" n="16">Roscius Anglicanus, <date value="1712">1712</date>.</note> says, 'It (i.e. the Italian Opera) lasted but 5 Days, and they being lik'd but indifferently by the Gentry; they in a little time marcht back to their own Country. The first play Acted there was The Gamester.'
   </p><p>It is singular that neither of these authorities are correct, and luckily we have the advertisements left to guide us. It is, however, somewhat strange that there should have been no public announcement in the newspapers of its opening; but the first advertisement published is in the Daily Courant, April 14, <date value="1705">1705</date>: 'At the Queens Theatre in the Haymarket, this present Saturday being the 14th of April, will be reviv'd, The Indian Emperor, or the Conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards. The Part of Cortez to be perform'd by Mr. Powel; with Entertainments of Dancing, as also Singing by the new Italian Boy. By Her Majesty's Sworn Servants.'
   </p><p>The next play was ' The Merry Wives of Windsor,' on April 23 ; on the 27th ' The Gamester'; and Downes says 'The Confederacy' was played long after.
   </p><p>This theatre was, undoubtedly, the most fashionable; and its prices, at times, were far above its rivals. Take, for example <note place="foot" n="17">Daily Courant Feb. 4, <date value="1708">1708</date>.</note>: 'At the Desire of several Persons of Quality. At the Queen's Theatre in the Hay Market, on Saturday next, being the 7th of February, will be presented an Opera call'd



<pb n="9" id="p.9"/>
 Camilla. The Part of Metius (to which are added several new Select Songs) to be perform'd by the famous Signior Gioseppe Cassani, lately arrived from Italy. With several new Entertainments of Dancing by Monsieur Cherrier, Monsieur Debargues, Mrs. Santlow, Mrs. Evans, and others. The Boxes to be open'd to the Pit, and no Person to be admitted but by Tickets, which will be deliver'd out on Friday and Saturday Morning at White's Chocolate House, at a Guinea each Ticket. The Number of Tickets not to exceed 450.' On the 6th same month the performance was lowered to half a guinea. Stage boxes, half a guinea; first gallery, 5s.; upper gallery, 2s.; and on Feb. 10 admission was still further lowered.
  </p><p> Congreve soon gave up his share, and Sir John Vanbrugh was also glad to get rid of this 'bad egg'; so after Jan. 10,
<date value="1708">1708</date>, it was transferred to Owen Mac Swiney for operatic performances, one of which we have just mentioned.
   </p><p> Pinkethman, the indefatigable, had a theatre at Greenwich, which he worked during the summer months, though the exact time is unknown. In an advertisement of his moving picture (Daily Courant, May 9, <date value="1709">1709</date>) he says it may be seen
'next Door to his New Play House, where variety of Plays are Acted every Day as in London.' He could not long have started, as in the Tatler (No. 4, April 18, <date value="1709">1709</date>) it says,
'We hear Mr. Penkethman has removed his ingenious Company of Strollers to Greenwich.  But other letters from Deptford say, the company is only making thither, and not yet settled; but that several Heathen Gods and Goddesses, which are to descend in machines, landed at the King's Head Stairs last Saturday.  Venus and Cupid went on foot from thence to Greenwich; Mars got drunk in the town, and broke his Landlord's head, for which he sat in the Stocks the whole Evening; but Mr. Penkethman giving Security that he should do nothing this ensuing Summer, he was set at liberty. The most melancholy part of all was, that Diana was taken, and committed by Justice Wrathful; which has, it seems, put a stop to the Diversions of the Theatre at Blackheath. But there goes down another Diana and a Patient Grissel next tide from Billingsgate.'
<pb n="10" id="p.10"/>

   </p><p>Queen Anne was not a patron of the drama. She never went to the theatre, and, as far as I can learn, seldom had dramatic performances at court.  'On Sunday, being the Queen's Birth Day, her Majesty receiv'd the usual Compliments on that occasion, and yesterday there was an extraordinary appearance of the Nobility and Gentry of both Sexes at St. James's upon the same account.  The Play call'd, All for Love,<note place="foot" n="18">All for Love, or the World Well Lost, by Dryden.</note> was Acted in the presence of the Court.' <note place="foot" n="19">Postman, Feb. 5/8, <date value="1704">1704</date>.</note> And this was such an extraordinary event that even another newspaper informed its readers of the astounding fact. Downes remarks on this: 'Note From Candlemas <date value="1704">1704</date> to the 22d of April <date value="1706">1706</date>. There were 4 Plays commanded to be Acted at Court at St. James', by the Actors of both Houses viz. First All for Love. The Second was Sir Solomon or the Cautious Coxcomb.<note place="foot" n="20">A translation from the Ecole des Femmes of Moliere, and attributed to John Caryll.</note>  The next was The Merry Wives of Windsor, Acted the 23rd of April, the Queen's Coronation Day. The last was The Anatomist or Sham Doctor ;<note place="foot" n="21">By Edward Ravenscroft, 169,.</note> it was perform'd on Shrove Tuesday, the Queen's Birthday.'
   </p><p>But though she would not go to the theatres, she heartily took their reformation in hand, as the following proclamation shows :
</p><p>
'ANNE R.
   </p><p>'WHEREAS. We have already given Orders to the Master of Our Revels, and also to Both the Companies of Comedians, Acting in <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName>, and Lincolns Inn Fields, to take Special Care, that Nothing be Acted in either of the Theatres contrary to Religion or Good Manners, upon Pain of our High Displeasure, and of being Silenc'd from further Acting; And being further desirous to Reform all other Indecencies, and Abuses of the Stage, which have Occasion'd great Disorders, and Justly give Offence; Our Will and Pleasure therefore is, and We do hereby strictly Command, That no Person of what Quality soever, Presume to go Behind the Scenes, or come upon the Stage, either before, or during the Acting of any Play. That no Woman be Allow'd

  <pb id="p.11" n="11"/>
 or Presume to wear a Vizard Mask in either of the Theatres. And that no Person come into either House without Paying the Prices Establish'd for their Respective Places.
 </p><p>  ' All which Orders We strictly Command all Managers, Sharers, and Actors of the said Companies, to see exactly Observ'd, and Obey'd. And We Require and Command all Our Constables, and others appointed to Attend the Theatres, to be Aiding and Assisting to them therein. And if any Persons whatsoever shall disobey this Our Known Pleasure and Command, We shall Proceed against them as Contemners of Our Royal Authority, and Disturbers of the Publick Peace.
 </p><p>  'Given at our Court at St. James's the 17th Day of January.
 </p><p>  'In the Second Year of our Reign.'
  </p><p> Luttrell, writing on January 20, <date value="1704">1704</date>, says: 'This day, the lords ordered thanks to the Queen for restraining the play houses from immorality.'
</p>
   <p>This proclamation, however, did not have the desired effect, for another appeared in March the same year:
'WHEREAS great Complaints have been made to Her Majesty, of many indecent, prophane and immoral Expressions that are usually spoken by Players and Mountebanks contrary to Religion and Good Manners. And thereupon Her Majesty has lately given Order to Charles Killigrew, Esqre.; Her Majesty's Master of the Revels, to take especial care to correct all such Abuses. The said Master of the Revels does therefore hereby require all Stage Players, Mountebanks, and all other Persons, mounting Stages, or otherwise, to bring their Several Plays, Drolls, Farces, Interludes, Dialogues, Prologues, and other Entertainments, fairly written, to him at his Office in Somerset House, to be by him perused, corrected and allow'd under his hand, pursuant to Her Majesty's Commands, upon pain of being proceeded against for contempt of Her Majesty's said Order,' 1 <note place="foot" n="22">Daily Courant, March 9, <date value="1704">1704</date>.</note>etc. Another proclamation appeared in the Gazette,


<pb n="12" id="p.12"/>
 Nov. 13/15, <date value="1711">1711</date>, forbidding anybody to stand upon the stage or go behind the scenes.
</p><p>   That these proclamations were not strictly attended to is evidenced by the notices scattered over the newspaper advertisements, till <date value="1712">1712</date>, that no persons were allowed on the stage, or behind the scenes, by her Majesty's command; but, after this last proclamation, the practice seems to have been stopped.
</p>   <p>Anne was determined that her orders should be carried out, and looked after the small fry as well as the big fish.
' Whereas the Master of the Revels has received Information, That several Companies of Strolling Actors pretend to have Licenses from Noblemen, and presume under that pretence to avoid the Master of the Revels, his Correcting their Plays, Drolls, Farces, and Interludes; which being against Her Majesty's Intentions and Directions to the said Master: These are to signifie. That such Licenses are not of any Force or authority. There are likewise several Mountebanks Acting upon Stages, and Mountebanks on Horseback, Persons that keep Poppets, and others that make Shew of Monsters, and strange Sights of living Creatures, who presume to Travel without the said Master of the Revels' Licence,<note place="foot" n="23">London Gazette, Feb. 1/5, <date value="1705">1705</date>. </note> etc., and goes on to say that their exhibitions must be licensed by him, under penalty.
</p>  <p> These strolling actors seem to have been poor enough, and might fairly come under the category of 'vagabonds by Act of Parliament' if the account Steele <note place="foot" n="24">Spectator, No. 48.</note> gives of them be in any way correct: 'We have now at this Place a Company of Strolers, who are very far from offending in the impertinent Splendour of the Drama. They are so far from falling into these false Gallantries, that the Stage is here in its Original Situation of a Cart. Alexander the Great was acted by a Fellow in a Paper Cravat; The next Day the Earl of Essex seemed to have no Distress but his Poverty: and my Lord Foppington the same Morning wanted any better means to shew himself a Fop Man by wearing Stockings of different Colours. In a Word tho' they have had a full Barn for many Days together, our Itinerants are still so wretchedly

<pb n="13" id="p.13"/>
 poor, that without you can prevail to send us the Furniture you forbid at the Play House, the Heroes appear only like sturdy Beggars, and the Heroines Gipsies.
 </p> <p> 'No person to be admitted to keep Places in the Pit' seems a singular order, were it not explicable by the fact that people used to send their footmen to keep places for them until their arrival, and that the manners of these gentry gave great offence to the habitues of the pit. The proper place for the footmen was the upper gallery, which was allowed to them free, supposing they were in attendance on their masters. We have seen Pinkethman's power over them, but their behaviour generally was rough and noisy. In the Female Tatler, Dec. 9, <date value="1709">1709</date>, is this notice: 'Dropt near the Play house, in the Haymarket, a bundle of Horsewhips, designed to belabour the Footmen in the Upper Gallery, who almost every Night this Winter, have made such an intolerable Disturbance, that the Players could not be heard, and their Masters were obliged to hiss them into silence. Whoever has taken up the said Whips, is desired to leave 'em with my Lord Rake's Porter, several Noblemen resolving to exercise 'em on their Backs, the next Frosty Morning.'
 </p><p>  The bad behaviour was not wholly confined to the lackeys, for Addison<note place="foot" n="25">Spectator, No. 45</note>.  alludes to that of some ladies whilst at the Theatre: 'A little before the rising of the Curtain, she broke out into a loud Soliloquy, When will the Dear Witches enter? and immediately upon their first Appearance, asked a Lady that sat three Boxes from her, on her Right Hand, if those Witches were not charming Creatures. A little after, as Betterton was in one of the finest Speeches of the Play, she shook her Fan at another Lady, who sat as far on the Left Hand, and told her with a Whisper that might be heard all over the Pit, We must not expect to see Ballon to-night. Not long after, calling out to a young Baronet by his Name, who sat three seats before me, she asked him whether Macbeth's wife was still alive; and before he could give an Answer, fell a talking of the Ghost of Banquo.'
 </p><p> Steele,<note place="foot" n="26">Ibid. No. 240.</note> too, tells of the bad conduct of a beau, which curiously illustrates the necessity of Anne's proclamations:

<pb n="14" id="p.14"/>

'This was a very lusty Fellow, but withal a sort of Beau, who getting into one of the Side boxes on the Stage before the Curtain drew, was disposed to shew the whole Audience his Activity by leaping over the Spikes; he pass'd from thence to one of the Entering Doors, where he took Snuff with a tolerable good Grace, display'd his fine Cloaths, made two or three feint Passes at the Curtain with his Cane, then faced about and appear'd at t'other Door: Here he affected to survey the whole House, bow'd and smil'd at random, and then shew'd his Teeth, which were some of them indeed very white: After this he retired behind the Curtain, and obliged us with several Views of his Person from every Opening.'
  </p><p> And, again, take this short sketch: 'And our rakely young Fellows live as much by their Wits as ever; and to avoid the clinking Dun of a Boxkeeper, at the End of one Act, they sneak to the opposite Side 'till the End of another; then call the Boxkeeper saucy Rascal, ridicule the Poet, laugh at the Actors, march to the Opera, and spunge away the rest of the Evening. The Women of the Town take their Places in the Pit with their wonted Assurance. The middle Gallery is fill'd with the middle Part of the City: and your high exalted Galleries are grac'd with handsome Footmen, that wear their Master's Linen.'<note place="foot" n="27"> Humours of the Army, Chas. Shadwell, <date value="1713">1713</date>.</note>
 </p><p>  Such then was the appearance in front of the stage; and, to thoroughly realise the scene, we must remember, en passant, that necessary individual the 'Candle Snuffer,' and those bold young women, whose class Nell Gwynne made famous, the
' Orange Wenches.'
</p><p>   Four or five hours in such theatres were almost insupportable without some slight refreshment, and this was supplied by these girls, who continually circulated throughout the audience. Their class is sufficiently alluded to in a passage in the Spectator, No. 141 : 'A Poet sacrifices the best Part of his Audience to the Worst ; and as one would think neglects the Boxes, to write to the Orange Wenches.' They seem to have fulfilled other duties besides supplying refreshment:-
  </p><p>    <quote rend="blockquote">  <l>Now turn, and see where loaden with her Freight,</l>

         <l>See! how her Charge hangs dangling by the Rim,</l>
         <l>See! how the Balls blush o'er the Basket-brim</l>
         <l>But little those she minds, the cunning Belle</l>

         <l>Has reach'd the Box, and lays in Lady's Lap.<note place="foot" n="28">The Stage, N. Rowe.</note></l>
</quote>
</p><p>   Bad weather occasionally militated against the poor players.  'Her Majesty's Servants at the Theatre Royal
(the weather being chang'd) intend to act on Wednesdays and Fridays till Bartholomew  Fair.'<note place="foot" n="29">Daily Courant, July 26, <date value="1704">1704</date>.</note> This and bad trade made them look out for novelties, such as acting a play the characters in which were sustained entirely by women, or having amateurs on the stage.  'At the Theatre Royal in
<placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName>, to morrow being Friday the 7th of July, will be reviv'd a Play call'd, The Orphan, or, the Unhappy Marriage.<note place="foot" n="30">By Thos.

 </p><p>  The properties of a theatre have always been a fair whetstone for men to sharpen their humour on, and the writers of the time of Queen Anne were not behindhand in this respect. When <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName> was closed by order, in <date value="1709">1709</date>, the Tatler (No. 42) made very merry over the miscellaneous effects:-
 </p><p>  'Three Bottles and a half of lightning.
</p><p>   'One Shower of Snow in the whitest French Paper.
</p><p>   'Two Showers of a browner sort.
</p><p>   'A Sea, consisting of a dozen large waves; the tenth bigger than ordinary, and a little damaged.
</p><p>   ' A dozen and a half of Clouds, trimmed with black, and well conditioned.
</p><p>   'A Mustard bowl to make Thunder with.
</p><p>   'The Complexion of a Murderer in a Bandbox; consisting


<pb n="16" id="p.16"/>

 of a large piece of burnt Cork, and a Coal black Peruke,' etc.
  </p><p>  At the death of Peer, the property man at this theatre, the Guardian extracted much fun from a catalogue of articles under his care.
  </p><p>  Rowe goes into poetry on the same subject-thus:-
  </p><p>   <quote rend="blockquote">   <l>Hung on the selfsame Peg, in Union rest</l>
<l>        Young Tarquin's Trowsers, and Lucretia's Vest,</l>

<l>        Near these sets up a Dragon drawn Calash,</l>
<l>        There a Ghost's Doublet delicately slash'd,</l>
<l>        Bleeds from the mangled Breast, and gapes a frightful Gash.</l>
<l>        In Crimson wrought the sanguine Floods abound,</l>

</quote>
</p><p>   The actors of this reign, with a few exceptions, were not people of much genius. After these few, some were respectable, the rest bad; but, although the play was the proper place of amusement to go to, and there were seldom more than two theatres open at once, yet we find it comparatively languishing, the companies frequently playing only twice a week, or the theatre closed altogether. Doubtless the tragedy was stilted, and the comedy was akin to buffoonery.  As witness to the latter let Addison <note place="foot" n="32">Spectator, No. 44.</note> testify: 'It would be an Endless Task to consider Comedy in the same Light, and to mention the innumerable Shifts that small Wits put in practice to raise a Laugh. Bullock in a short Coat, and Norris in a long one, seldom fail of this Effect. In ordinary Comedies, a broad and a narrow Brim'd Hat are different
<pb n="17" id="p.17"/>
 characters.  Sometimes the Wit of the Scene lies in a Shoulder belt, and sometimes in a Pair of whiskers.'
  </p><p> The 'Phoenix of the Stage,' as Anthony, or Tony, Aston calls Betterton, stands pre-eminent among the actors. Born in <date value="1635">1635</date>, he was an old man when Queen Anne came to the throne; and he died on April 28, I710, from the effects of gout, which he aggravated by acting when the fit was on. His last performance was on April 13, 171O, and it is thus described in the Daily Courant of that date: 'At the Desire of several Persons of Quality.  For the Benefit of Mr. Betterton. At the Queen's Theatre in the Hay market this present Thursday being the 13th April will be Reviv'd, The Maid's Tragedy. <note place="foot" n="33">By Beaumont and Fletcher. </note> The part of Melantius by Mr. Betterton, Amintor by Mr. Wilks, Calianax by Mr. Pinkethman, Evadne by Mrs. Barry, and all the other parts to the best Advantage. To which will be added Three Designs, Representing the Three Principal Actions of the Play, in Imitation of so many great Pieces of History Painting, where all the real Persons concern'd in those Actions will be Plac'd at proper distances, in different Postures peculiar to the Passion of each Character.'
  </p><p>  Totally unfit, from illness, to act, he had resort to violent remedies to enable him to go through his part, which he did, with his gouty foot in a slipper, but the exertion killed him. A great favourite of Charles II., that king not only sent him to Paris, to see and report on the French theatres, but appointed him to teach the nobility for court theatricals, whilst his wife tutored the future queens Mary and Annein fact, the latter settled a pension of 100 &#x00A3;. per annum upon her, after her husband's death. Pepys describes him as 'the best actor in the world,' and so he undoubtedly was-in his age. Aston <note place="foot" n="34">Supplement to Cibber.</note> describes him thus: ' He had little Eyes, and a broad Face, a little Pock fretten, a Corpulent Body, and thick Legs, with large Feet .... His Voice was low and grumbling; yet he could Tune it by an artful Climax, which enforc'd universal Attention, even from the Fops and Orange Girls.  He was incapable of dancing even in a Country Dance.'

<pb n="18" id="p.18"/>

  </p><p> Room must be found for one little anecdote which Aston tells of him. ' Mr. Betterton had a small Farm near Reading, in the County of Berks; and a Countryman came, in the Time of Bartholomew Fair, to pay his Rent. Mr. Betterton took him to the Fair, and going to one Crawley's Puppet Shew, offer'd Two Shillings for himself and Roger, his Tenant.-No, no, Sir, said Crawley; we never take Money of one Another. This affronted Mr. Betterton, who threw down the Money, and they entered.'
   </p><p>Among the actors of the time he was looked up to as a king. Downes<note place="foot" n="35"> Roscius Anglicanus, <date value="1708">1708</date>.</note> says: 'I must not Omit Praises due to Mr. Betterton. The first and now only remains of the old Stock, of the Company of Sir William Davenant in Lincolns Inn Fields; he like an old Stately Spreading Oak now stands Fixt, Environ'd round with brave Young Growing Flourishing Plants .... Mr. Dryden a little before his Death in a Prologue, rendring him this Praise:-
    </p><p> <quote rend="blockquote">  <l>He like the Setting Sun, still shows a Glimmery Ray</l>
        <l>Like Antient ROME Majestick in decay.</l>
</quote>
 </p><p>  He was buried in <placeName key="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</placeName>
    on <date value="1710-05-02">May 2, 1710</date>, and Steele <note place="foot" n="36"> Tatler, 167.</note> wrote a long panegyric upon him, saying he
'ought to be recorded with the same respect as Roscius among the Romans.'
  </p><p> He died, not in want, but in comparatively poor circumstances, and he must have been a man of some culture, as the following advertisement, soon after his death, shows :<note n="3"  place="foot">Harl. MSS. <date value="5996">5996</date>, 100.</note> ' This Day will be Continued the Sale by Auction of the Prints, and Books of Prints and Drawings, of Mr. Tho Betterton deceased, &#x0026;c.'
  </p> <p>Verbruggen, although he died in <date value="1708">1708</date>, played in Queen Anne's reign. But little is known of him, except that he was a tragedian, and was the original Oronooko. A contemporary character of him is 'A fellow with a crackt voice, he clangs his words, as if he spoke out of a broken drum.'<note place="foot" n="37"> Comparison between the two Stages.</note> Downes says, 'his Person being tall, well built and clean, only he was a little In Kneed, which gave him a shambling Gate;'



<pb n="19" id="p.19"/>
 and he adds,' Verbruggen was Nature without Extravagance
-Freedom without Licentiousness-and vociferous without bellowing.'
 </p><p>  Cave Underhill was another veteran, of whom Steele writes<note place="foot" n="38">Tatler, 22</note> when making an appeal to the public to support him: 'he has been a comic for three generations; my father admired him extremely when he was a boy.' He took a benefit at <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName> on June 3, <date value="1709">1709</date>, when 'Hamlet' was played, and he took his favourite part of the gravedigger.
  </p><p> Leigh was another old actor who died in this reign.
  </p><p> Estcourt deserves notice. He was born in <date value="1668">1668</date>, and, at the age of 15, ran away from his father's house, and joined a company of strollers at Worcester. He was recovered, and apprenticed to an apothecary in London; again ran away, and led a wandering life for some years, till we find him engaged at <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName>. Downes describes him as 'Histrio Natus; he has the Honour (Nature enduing him with an easy, free, unaffected Mode of Elocution) in Comedy always to Lcetificate his Audience, especially Quality.' He was a pet of the Duke of Marlborough, and was Providore of the famous Beefsteak Club, where he wore a small gold gridiron suspended from his neck by a green ribbon. He retired from the stage some time before his death, and took the 'Bumper' in St. James Street, where he Lcetificated his customers in another manner. Steele puffed him in the Spectator, and wept over his decease in the same periodical.<note place="foot" n="39">No. 468.</note>
 </p><p> The name of Dogget is, perhaps, as well known to us as any actor of the time. An Irishman by birth, he came to England and joined a travelling troupe; afterwards being good enough to play at both <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName>, and Lincoln's Inn Fields. In fact, he was joint manager of the former with Wilks and Cibber, but gave it up in <date value="1713">1713</date>, because Booth was forced on him as a co-partner; and he never returned to the theatre, either as a regular actor or as manager. It must have been a blow to him, for he was fond of money, and was then reputed to have been worth &#x00A3; 1,000 per annum. He was not particular: he put his pride in his pocket, and had a booth at Bartholomew Fair, the same as Pinkethman or Mills. He



<pb n="20" id="p.20"/>
 died at Eltham, in Kent, Sept. 22, <date value="1721">1721</date>, and left in his will the memorable Coat and Badge to be raced for, annually, on the anniversary of the accession of George the First, to show his attachment to the Whig party and the House of Brunswick. Downes says of him, 'On the Stage, he's very Aspectabund, wearing Farce in his Face; his Thoughts deliberately framing his Utterance Congruous to his Looks; He is the only Comick Original now extant.' Tony Aston says 'he was a little, lively spract Man . . . a Man of very good Sense, but illiterate; for he wrote me Word thus-Sir, I will give you a hole, instead of (whole) Share. He dress'd neat, and something fine, in a plain Cloth Coat, and a Brocaded Waistcoat.'
  </p><p> Colley Cibber was born in London Nov. 6, <date value="1671">1671</date>, and is known as much, or more, as a playwright, or poet, as an actor. In his boyhood he tried for a scholarship at Winchester, but failed; afterwards he meditated going to the University, but the Revolution of <date value="1688">1688</date> broke out, and he was for a short time in the army as his father's substitute. He saw no service, and soon became an actor, i.e. in <date value="1690">1690</date>, and did not quit the stage till <date value="1730">1730</date>, in which year he was made Poet Laureate to George II. He died Dec. 12, <date value="1757">1757</date>. Downes tells us he was
'A Gentleman of his time who has Arriv'd to an exceeding Perfection, in hitting justly the Humour of a starcht Beau or Fop; as the Lord Fopington; Sir Fopling and Sir Courtly, equalling in the last the late Eminent Mr. Mountfort, not much Inferior in Tragedy, had Nature given him Lungs Strenuous to his finisht Judgment.' Gildon,<note place="foot" n="40">Comparison between the two Stages.</note> however, falls foul of him; but then, the only good words he had were for Betterton and Barry.</p><p>
<quote rend="blockquote">  <l>Ramble. But prithee look on this side; there's Cibber, a poet and fine Actor.</l>
   <l>Critick. And one that's always repining at the success of others, and upon the stage makes all his fellow actors uneasy.</l>
 </quote></p><p>
   Wilks, the best tragedian of the age, came of a good Worcestershire family, and, from his association with actors, drifted into the profession. He was remarkable for the carefulness of his acting, and for the ease and good breeding he displayed


<pb n="21" id="p.21"/>
 upon the stage. He died in <date value="1732">1732</date> at the age of 76. What do his contemporaries say of him ? Downes says, 'Proper and Comely in Person, of Graceful Port, Mein and Air; void of Affectation; his Elevations and Cadences just, Congruent to Elocution.' The author of 'The Comparison between the two Stages' can say nothing ill-natured of him, and Steele<note place="foot" n="41">Spectator, 370</note> speaks highly of him.</p><p>
  <quote rend="blockquote"><l>Ramble. Ay, but Powell
  Critick. </l><l>Is an idle fellow, that neither minds his business, nor lives quietly in any</l></quote> communityis a fair criticism on that actor, who, had he been but as steady or painstaking, might have rivalled Wilks; but he was a drunken, dissipated dog, a careless study, with a bad memory; pursued by bailiffs, he sometimes walked with his sword drawn-once making an unfortunate 'officer' retreat to the other side of the road, where he called out, ' We don't want you now, Mr. Powel.' Died Dec. 14, <date value="1715">1715</date>.
  </p><p> Booth was the Aristo of the profession. He was not only nearly related to the Earl of Warrington, but in <date value="1704">1704</date> he married a daughter of Sir William Barkham, Bart., of Norfolk. A scholar of the great and terrible Dr. Busby, he shone in acting in the Latin plays at Westminster. He was intended for the Church, but he caught stage fever, ran away from school at the age of 17, and joined the theatre at Dublin. When he came to London he became a pupil of Betterton's, and profited by his master's instructions. He was joint patentee in <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName>, but he left the stage at the early age of 46. Died <date value="1733">1733</date>.
  </p><p> Of the minor actors Pinkethman stands first. He was low comedy, and his great ambition was to please the gods. We have heard a good deal about him in this book in his various characters as caterer for the amusement of the public. Gildon, of course, can say nothing good of him.</p><p>
 <quote rend="blockquote"><l> Sullen. But Penkethman the flower of--
  Critick.</l><l> Bartholomew Fair, and the idol of the rabble; a fellow that</l></quote> over does everything, and spoils many a part with his own stuff. Be this as it may, he is very honourably mentioned throughout the Spectator, although Steele<note place="foot" n="42">Tatler, 188.</note> gives him a good-humoured


<pb n="22" id="p.22"/>
 rap over the knuckles.  'Mr. William  Bullock and Mr. William Penkethman are of the same Age, Profession, and Sex.  They both distinguish themselves in a very particular Manner under the discipline of the Crab-tree, with this only difference, that Mr. Bullock has the more agreeable Squall, and Mr. Penkethman the more graceful Shrug. Penkethman devours a cold Chick with great Applause; Bullock's talent lies chiefly in Asparagus. Penkethman is very dexterous at conveying himself under a Table; Bullock is no less active in jumping over a Stick. Penkethman has a great deal of money; but Mr. Bullock is the taller man.'
 </p><p>  The mention of Crab-tree seems to suggest that Pinkethman had been thrashed at some period of his career, as does a passage in another Tatler (No. 42), describing the theatrical properties at <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName>: 'Three oak Cudgels, with one of Crab-tree; all bought for the Use of Mr. Pinkethman.'

   </p><p> It is singular that the ladies of the stage of this period stand out so prominently for their talents. It must have been by natural genius, for they could have had little enough tradition to guide them, it being only forty or fifty years since the first woman ever trod the boards. Who she was seems to be somewhat obscure, but it probably was Mrs. Coleman, who played Ianthe in the first part of the 'Siege of Rhodes' in
<date value="1656">1656</date>, but she did not speak. We know Kynaston, who kept Charles II. waiting whilst he was being shaved to play his part; he of whom     Pepys writes <note place="foot" n="46">Diary, Jan. 7, <date value="1661">1661</date>. </note> thus: ' Kynaston, the boy, had the good turn to appear in three shapes; first as a poor woman in ordinary clothes to please Morose; then in fine clothes, as a gallant; and in them was the prettiest woman in the whole house; and lastly, as a man; and then likewise did appear the handsomest man in the house.' Of him Betterton writes,<note place="foot" n="47">The History of the English Stage.</note> 'that it has been disputed among the Judicious, whether any Woman could have more sensibly touched the Passions.' He seems to have been the last of the male actors who took female parts, although in <date value="1661">1661</date> a woman actor was still a novelty. 'There saw the " Scornfull Lady,"<note place="foot" n="48">By Beaumont and Fletcher.   </note> now done by a woman, which makes the play much better than ever it did to me.'<note place="foot" n="49">Pepys, Feb. 12, <date value="1661">1661</date>.</note> A Mrs. Sanderson is traditionally said to have been the first woman actress, and she played

<pb n="24" id="p.24"/>
 Desdemona at the theatre in Clare Market on Dec. 8, <date value="1660">1660</date>. Betterton says the mother of Norris, or Jubilee Dickey, 'was the first Woman who ever appeared on the Stage as an Actress.'
   </p><p> Anyhow, never was there a period that could show four such actresses as Mrs. Barry, Mrs. Bracegirdle, Mrs. Oldfield, and Mrs. Verbruggen.
   </p><p> Elizabeth Barry, the daughter of a barrister of good birth, was born <date value="1658">1658</date>; so that she was not in her first youth at the accession of Anne. Her father so encumbered his estate that it became necessary for his children to seek their fortunes as best they might. She chose the stage, and Sir Wm. Davenant took her in hand, but gave her up as hopeless. The Earl of Rochester, however, having wagered that by proper instruction she should be the finest actress on the stage in less than six months, she took such pains that when, in <date value="1677">1677</date>, she played the Hungarian Queen in the tragedy of 'Mustapha,' <note place="foot" n="50">By the Earl of Orrery.</note> before Charles the Second and the Duke and Duchess of York, she created an absolute furore: so much so that the Duchess took lessons from her, and not only gave her her wedding suit, but her coronation robes when she became queen. She died on November 7, <date value="1713">1713</date>, and was buried at Acton, where her daughter, by the Earl of Rochester, was already interred. Aston, speaking of her personal appearance, says: 'And yet this fine creature was not handsome, her Mouth op'ning most on the Right Side, which she strove to draw t'other way, and, at Times, composing her Face, as if sitting to have her Picture drawn. Mrs. Barry was middle siz'd, and had darkish Hair, light Eyes, dark Eye-brows, and was indifferently plump: Her Face somewhat preceded her Action, as the latter did her Words; her Face ever expressing the Passions; not like the Actresses of late Times, who are afraid of putting their Faces out of the Form of Non-meaning, lest they should crack the Cerum, White Wash, or other Cosmetic, trowel'd on.'
  </p><p>  Betterton says Mrs. Bracegirdle was the daughter of
 Justinian Bracegirdle of Northamptonshire, Esq., whilst
 Aston, who calls her 'the Diana of the Stage,' says 'The

<pb n="25" id="p.25"/>
 most received Opinion is, that she was the Daughter of a Coach Man, Coach maker, or Letter out of Coaches in the Town of Northampton, but I am inclinable to my Father's Opinion, (who had a great Value for her reported Virtue) that she was a distant Relation, and came out of Staffordshire from about Wallsal or Wolverhampton.' She is believed to have been born about the year <date value="1674">1674</date>, and somehow came to be placed, when an infant, under the care of Betterton and his Wife, who naturally brought her up to the stage. So young did she enter her future profession that she acted as a page in 'The Orphan,'<note place="foot" n="51">By Thos. Otway.</note> at the Dorset Garden Theatre in
<date value="1680">1680</date>, when only six years old. She was not only remarkable for her magnificent acting, but for the exceeding purity of her life, which no breath of scandal could sully; although it could not be said it was from want of temptation. Congreve writes of her:-

 She was wonderfully charitable, and would go daily about the slums of Clare Market relieving the necessitous; and woe be to anyone who should have dared to molest her-his fate would have been speedy. She retired from the stage in
<date value="1707">1707</date>, but did not die till <date value="1748">1748</date>. Her personal description is:
' She was of a lovely Height, with dark-brown Hair and Eye brows, black sparkling Eyes, and a fresh blushy Complexion; and, whenever she exerted herself, had an involuntary Flushing in her Breast, Neck and Face, having continually a

 chearful Aspect, and a fine Set of even White Teeth; never making an Exit, but that she left the Audience in an Imitation of her pleasant Countenance. Genteel Comedy was her chief Essay, and that too when in Men's Cloaths, in which she far surmounted all the Actresses of that Age' (Aston).
 </p><p>   Her great rival was Mrs. Anne Oldfield, who was born in Pall Mall in <date value="1683">1683</date>. Her father was in the Horse Guards, and on his death left his wife and daughter in very straitened circumstances. Tradition says that she was living with her aunt, who kept the Mitre Tavern in St. James's Market, when Sir John Vanbrugh heard her read some plays: certain it is, he introduced her to Rich, in <date value="1699">1699</date>, when she played Candiope, in 'Secret Love, or The Maiden Queen.' <note place="foot" n="52"> By Dryden.</note> Mrs. Oldfield was far from being as immaculate in character as her rival. Her last performance was on April 28, <date value="1730">1730</date>; she died October

 </p><p>  Steele<note place="foot" n="53">Tatler, 212.</note> gives her portrait thus: ' FLAVIA is ever well dressed, and always the genteelest woman you meet; but the make of her mind very much contributes to the ornament of her body.

This makes everything look native about her, and her clothes are so exactly fitted, that they appear, as it were, part of her person,' etc.

   </p><p>Hers was a romantic history. Her maiden name was Percival, and she married Mountford the actor, who was killed by Lord Mohun for protecting Mrs. Bracegirdle. Betterton says,' Her Father Mr. Percival had the Misfortune to be drawn into the Assassination Plot against King William; for this he lay under Sentence of Death, which he received on the same Night that Lord Mohun killed her Husband, Mr. Mountfort. Under this, almost insuperable Affliction, she was introduced to the good Queen Mary, who


<pb n="27" id="p.27"/>
 being, as she was pleased to say, Struck to the Heart upon receiving Mrs. Mountfort's Petition, immediately granted all that was in her Power, a Remission of her Father's Execution for that of Transportation. But Fate had so ordered it that poor Mrs. Mountfort was to lose both Father and Husband. For as Mr. Percival was going abroad, he was so weakened by his Imprisonment, that he was taken Sick on the Road, and died at Portsmouth.' She afterwards married Jack Verbruggen, and their married life is thus described by Aston:
' She was the best Conversation possible; never Captious, or displeased at any Thing but what was gross or indecent; for she was cautious lest fiery Jack shou'd so resent it as to breed a Quarrel; for he wou'd often say Dammee ! tho' I don't much value my Wife yet no Body shall affront her, by G-d; and his Sword was drawn on the least occasion, which was much the fashion in the latter End of King William's Reign.' She is described as being 'a fine fair Woman, plump, full featured, her Face of a fine smooth Oval.'
 </p><p>  The theatre never solely depended upon the drama for its attractions, and there was generally a ballet of some description; not, of course, such elaborate affairs as we have now, but performances by one or two artists, such as M. L'Abbe and Mrs. Elford. The dances were such as chacones, minuets, allmands, corantos, jigs, sarabands, etc., and we have already seen the pains taken with this art, and the elaborate instructions of its professors.</p>

<p><date value="1673">1673</date>.4. 5 Jan. I saw an Italian opera in Music, the first that had been in England of this Kind,' writes Evelyn; but Pepys mentions it even earlier: ' <date value="1667">1667</date>.8. Jan. 12. With my Lord Brouncker to his house, there to hear some Italian musique, and here we met Tom Killigrew, Sir Robert Murray, and the Italian, Signor Baptista,<note place="foot" n="1">Battista Draghi.</note> who hath prepared a play in Italian for the Opera, which Sir T. Killigrew do intend to have up; and here he did sing one of the Acts.' There is, however, no record of either of these being acted. The first opera of which we have any record is a translation of 'Arsinoe,' an Italian opera written by Stanzani of Bologna, for the theatre of that town, in <date value="1677">1677</date>, and here is the premier advertisement of opera in England.

The Boxes on the Stage and the Galleries are for the benefit of the Actors.'1<note place="foot" n="2">Daily Courant, Jan. 16, <date value="1705">1705</date>.</note> The singers were all English; and here we have the commencement of the subscription opera.</p>
<p>  In the next two years there were but very few operas, although Addison wrote one called' Rosamond.' During this period, too, the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket was opened for opera, with what success we have seen.
</p><p>  The thin edge of the wedge, as regards Italian singing, was introduced in <date value="1707">1707</date>, when Valentini Urbani, a Castrato, and a female singer called ' The Baroness,' came over here. They made their first appearance 'At the Theatre Royal in <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName>, this present Saturday, being the 6th of December, will be presented an Opera called "Camilla." All to be sung after the Italian manner. The Parts of Latinus by Mr. Turner, Prenesto by Signiora Margarita, part in Italian, Turnus by Signior Valentino, in Italian, Metius by Mr. Ramondon, Linco by Mr. Leveridge, Camilla by Mrs. Tofts, Lavinia by the Baroness, most in Italian, Tullia by Mrs. Lindsey.' <note place="foot" n="3">Ibid. Dec. 6, <date value="1707">1707</date>.</note>
</p><p>  What a curious mixture it must have been, some singing in Italian and some in English! but it was not the sole example, for when Italian opera was introduced into Germany the recitative was given in German and the airs sung in Italian.
</p><p>  Of course an innovation, and coming from a foreign source, roused the insular prejudices of John Bull. It was un-English. As Dennis, the critic, wrote 3<note place="foot" n="4">An Essay on the Operas after the Italian Manner, <date value="1706">1706</date>.</note>: 'And yet tho' the Reformation and Liberty and the Drama were establish'd among us together, and have flourish'd among us together, and have still been like to have fall'n together; notwithstanding all this, at this present Juncture, when Liberty and the Reformation are in the utmost Danger, we are going

<pb n="30" id="p.30"/>
 very bravely to oppress the Drama, in order to establish the luxurious Diversions of those very Nations, from whose Attempts and Designs, both Liberty and the Reformation are in the utmost Danger.'</p>
<p>   With far greater sense and show of reason he says: 'If
 that is truly the most Gothick, which is the most oppos'd to
 Antick, nothing can be more Gothick than an Opera, since
 nothing can be more oppos'd to the ancient Tragedy, than
 the modern Tragedy in Musick, because the one is reasonable,
 the other ridiculous; the one is artful, the other absurd; the
 one beneficial, the other pernicious; in short, the one natural,
 and the other monstrous. And the modern Tragedy in
 Musick, is as much oppos'd to the Chorus, which is the
 Musical part of the Ancient Tragedy, as it is in the Episodique; because, in the Chorus, the Musick is always great
 and solemn, in the Opera 'tis often most trifling and most
 effeminate; in the Chorus the Music is only for the sake of
 the Sense, in the Opera the Sense is most apparently for the
 sake of the Music.'</p>
<p>  This mongrel style of performance, half Italian, half English, lasted till <date value="1710">1710</date>. ' Pyrrhus and Demetrius' (a translation of 'Pirro e Demetrio' of Adriano Morselli) was the last opera thus played. On Jan. 3, <date value="1709">1709</date>, the prices of admission were considerably reduced: stage boxes from 15s. to 8s., first gallery from 5s. to 2s. 6d., and upper gallery from 2s. to
1s. 6d., and the pit was 5s.</p>
<p>  Steele laughingly criticises  <note place="foot" n="5">Tatler, No. 4.</note> the performance of 'Pyrrhus and Demetrius.' 'That the understanding has no part in the pleasure is evident, from what these letters very positively assert, to wit, that a great part of the performance was done in Italian; and a great Critic fell into fits in the Gallery, at seeing not only Time and Place, but Languages and Nations confused in the most incorrigible manner.'</p>
<p>  The opera of 'Almahide' (composer unknown, supposed to be Buononcini) was brought out at the Haymarket on Jan. 10, <date value="1710">1710</date>, and was the first opera ever played entirely in Italian and by Italian singers.  These were Nicolini, Valentini, Cassani, Margarita, and Isabella Girardeau. Still


<pb n="31" id="p.31"/>
 John Bull must assert himself, and between the acts intermezzi were sung in English by Dogget, Mrs. Lindsey, and Mrs. Cross.</p>
<p>  Another opera was that of 'Hydaspes' (by Francesco Mancini), which Addison <note place="foot" n="6">Spectator, 13.</note> made terrible fun of, especially of a fight that took place between Nicolini and a lion. He had previously<note place="foot" n="7">Ibid. 5.</note> unmercifully ridiculed 'Nicolini exposed to a Tempest in Robes of Ermine, and sailing in an Open Boat upon a Sea of Pasteboard,' 'the painted Dragons Spitting Wildfire, enchanted Chariots drawn by Flanders Mares, and real Cascades in artificial Landskips ;' but then he might have been sore at the fate of his own opera, 'Rosamond,' which was not a success.</p>
<p>  Towards the end of <date value="1710">1710</date> Handel, who was then twentyseven years of age, came over to England, upon the invitation of several noblemen, whose acquaintance he had made at the Court of Hanover; and here he wrote, for Aaron Hill, who then managed the Haymarket Theatre, his opera of' Rinaldo,' the first advertisement of which contains a silly blunder as to dates. 'By Subscription. At the Queen's Theatre in the Hay Market, this present Saturday being the 24th day of February, will be perform'd a new Opera, call'd Rinaldo. Tickets and Books will be delivered out at Mr. White's Chocolate House in St. James's Street, to Morrow and Saturday next.'<note place="foot" n="8">Daily Courant, Feb. 24, <date value="1711">1711</date></note>.

<p>  A few. short notes about the singers will be interesting. Very early in Anne's reign mention is made of a singer of whom the only record I can find, is in the following advertisement, and some few others: 'To all the Nobility and Gentry.. Whereas Mr. Abel, having been Honoured with the Commands of the Nobility and Gentry, to sing in <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName> 4 times ; this is to give notice that the said Mr. Abel has not engaged to sing in any other Consort, till that Noble Performance be ended.' <note place="foot" n="10">Postman, May 9 12, <date value="1702">1702</date>.</note></p>
<p>  Hughes was a favourite concert singer, with a good counter-tenor voice; and, when opera first came in, he always played the best parts, until Valentini came over, after which he either died, or left the stage, for no more is heard of him.</p>
<p>  Richard Leveridge had a fine and powerful bass voice, and stuck to the stage till he was more than eighty years old, singing in the pantomime at Covent Garden. He was not only an actor and singer, but a composer, having taken part in the composition of an English opera, called the 'Island Princess,' in <date value="1699">1699</date>, and he also wrote and composed many Bacchanalian songs. Died <date value="1758">1758</date>, aged 88.</p>
<p>  Of Lawrence little is known, except that when the opera of ' Hydaspes' was brought out, on May 23, <date value="1710">1710</date>, he was able to take a part in it, although an inferior one, and sing it in Italian. He had a tenor voice, and continued in Italian opera till <date value="1717">1717</date>, when trace is lost of him.
</p><p>  Ramondon seems to have come upon the stage in <date value="1705">1705</date>, and to have had a bass voice, as he took Leveridge's part in
'Arsinoe.' He seems to have left the stage with the opera of
'Pyrrhus and Demetrius,' but he published some songs in
<date value="1716">1716</date>, and set the song tunes in 'Camilla' for the harpsichord or spinet.</p>
<p>  Mrs. Tofts was our English prima donna, and she too

<pb n="33" id="p.33"/>
 possessed the then rare accomplishment of being able to sing in Italian. She was the daughter of a person in the family of Bishop Burnet, and, when she appeared on the stage, she won all hearts by her voice, figure, and performance. Her voice was more soprano than contralto.</p>
<p>  We have seen her disclaimer when her servant insulted Madame de l'Epine; and doubtless it was sincere, as she was an equal, if not a greater, favourite with the public. She retired from the stage, with a competence amassed by her exertions, in <date value="1709">1709</date>. If we may believe the Tatler (No. 20), she had sad cause for leaving the stage, having lost her reason. 'The great revolutions of this nature bring to my mind the distresses of the unfortunate CAMILLA, who has had the ill luck to break before her voice, and to disappear at a time when her beauty was in the height of its bloom. This lady entered so thoroughly into the great characters she acted, that when she had finished her part she could not think of retrenching her equipage, but would appear in her own lodgings with the same magnificence that she did upon the stage. This greatness of soul had reduced that unhappy princess to an involuntary retirement, where she now passes her time among the Woods and Forests, thinking on the Crowns and sceptres she has lost, and often humming over in her solitude,

<p>  Francesca Margherita de l'Epine came over here with a German musician named Greber, and was sometimes irreverently called 'Greber's Peg.' There is no doubt but that she sang very beautifully, and was without a rival on the stage, or in the concert room, after the retirement of Mrs. Tofts. She herself retired in <date value="1718">1718</date>, and married Dr. Pepusch, the celebrated musician, who gave her another nickname, that of
'Hecate,' because of her swarthy complexion and unprepossessing countenance. However, she came well dowered, for she brought him a fortune of 10,000&#x00A3;, a very large sum in those days. Swift, who evidently had a John Bull's dislike for everything foreign, writes from Windsor to Stella, <note place="foot" n="12">Journal, Aug. 6, <date value="1711">1711</date>.

<p>   The Cavaliere Nicolino Grimaldi, <note place="foot" n="13">Cavaliere di San Marco.</note> commonly called Nicolini, was a Neapolitan, and came over to England in <date value="1708">1708</date>, entirely on his own responsibility, hearing we were passionately fond of foreign operas. He had achieved a high reputation in Italy, and sustained it here, although foreigners were only tolerated, not liked. He first played in 'Pyrrhus and Demetrius,' and he left England June 14, <date value="1712">1712</date>. His departure is thus chronicled by Addison<note place="foot" n="2 ">Spectator, 405.</note>: 'I am very sorry to find, by the Opera Bills for this Day, that we are likely to lose the greatest Performer in Dramatick Musick that is now living, or that perhaps ever appeared upon a Stage. I need not acquaint my Reader, that I am speaking of Signior Nicolini.'
</p><p>  Of Isabella Girardeau we know little, save that her maiden name was Calliari, that she married a Frenchman, and sang from <date value="1700">1700</date> to <date value="1720">1720</date>.
</p><p>  Of the musical composers living in Anne's reign, perhaps the oldest was Dr. Blow, who died in <date value="1708">1708</date>. Then there was Tudway, who composed an anthem<note place="foot" n="14">'Thou, 0 God, hast heard my vows.'</note> on the occasion of Queen Anne visiting the University of Cambridge, in <date value="1705">1705</date>, which gained him his doctor's degree, and he was afterwards made public Professor of Music to that university, where he was longer remembered for his punning proclivities than for his musical talents.
</p><p>  Jeremiah Clarke, who was coadjutor with Dr. Blow as organist at the King's Chapel, composed the beautiful anthem
'Praise the Lord, 0 Jerusalem.' He shot himself in <date value="1707">1707</date> when about forty years of age. There is a curious story told about his suicidal mania. Some weeks before he finally committed the rash act, he was riding to town, accompanied by a servant, returning from a visit to a friend in the country, when the fit seized him, and, dismounting by a field in which was a pond surrounded by trees, he tossed up whether he should hang or drown. The coin fell on its edge in the clay, and saved his life for that time.
</p><p>  Dean Aldrich was then alive (he did not die till <date value="1710">1710</date>),


<pb n="36" id="p.36"/>
 and he will be long remembered, not only for his 'Artis Logicae Rudimenta,' but for his skill as a musical composer  <note place="foot" n="15">See Christ Church Bells, Appendix.</note>; whilst no one at all conversant with Church music will forget the names of Drs. Crofts and Greene.</p>
<p>   Among the secular composers was Tom D'Urfey, whose
'Pills to purge Melancholy' is a storehouse of song; but, with the exception of Henry Carey, whose 'Sally in our Alley' and ' Black Eyed Susan' are immortal, the opera and ballad composers of Anne's reign were of no great mark.</p>
<p>  A most curious outcome of musical brotherhood was Thomas Britton, the small coal man, already casually mentioned. He must not be passed over under any circumstances, as it is perhaps the only instance of fraternity, absolute and equal, recorded in this reign, between the upper and lower ranks of society. It was of him that Prior wrote:-
      <quote rend="blockquote">  <l> Though doom'd to small coal, yet to arts allied;
         </l><l>Rich without wealth, and famous without pride,

</quote>
</p><p>  This singular man had a small coal shop in Aylesbury Street. Clerkenwell; and his room, which was over his coal stores, could only be reached by a breakneck ladder, as Ward remarks-
            <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Upon Thursdays repair

</quote>
</p><p>  Somehow, he had a soul above his vocation. He was a fair chemist, and a collector (with some knowledge) of old books and manuscripts. But the most curious part of all his surroundings was the fact that he was able to gather round him in his dirty little den, not only all the musical talent

<pb n="37" id="p.37"/>
 available, but titled dilletanti, and even elegant ladies came to his reunions. It was quite the proper place to go to. Hear what old Thoresby says, <note place="foot" n="16">June 5, <date value="1712">1712</date>.</note> 'In our way home called at Mr. Britton's, the noted small coal man, where we heard a noble concert of music, vocal and instrumental, the best in town, which for many years past he has had weekly for his own entertainment, and of the gentry &#x0026;c. gratis, to which most foreigners and many persons of distinction, for the fancy of it, occasionally resort.' And no wonder, when the learned musical Dr. Pepusch might be present, or Handel played the harpsichord, whilst Banister would take first violin. Still, it was a peculiar place to meet in, and only shows what inconveniences people will suffer for fashion's sake.</p>
<p>  His death was almost as remarkable as his life. One of his performers was injudicious enough to introduce to him a friend of his who was a ventriloquist, who, without seeming to speak, bade him, as from a far-off, sepulchral voice, fall down on his knees at once and say the Lord's Prayer, for that he should die within a few hours. Poor Britton did as he was bid-then went home, took to his bed, and died in a few days of sheer fright, a victim to practical joking.</p>
<p>  There was a vast amount of musical taste at that time, but of course it was not so highly developed as now. We have seen that a dramatic performance was generally accompanied by a musical one, and the concerts, or consorts, as they were then called, were numerous.</p>
<p>  Owing probably to the mourning consequent on the decease of William III., the first announcement of a concert in Anne's reign that I can find is one postponed from April 30,
<date value="1702">1702</date>, to May 7, and this was to take place at Stationers' Hall, a very usual place for such entertainments. In the same newspaper is a notice that 'The Queen's Coronation Song, compos'd and Sung by Mr. Abell is to be perform'd at Stationers Hall near Ludgate, to Morrow, being the First of May <date value="1702">1702</date> at 8 of the Clock at Night precisely, with other Songs in Several Languages, and accompanied by the greatest Masters of Instrumental Musick; Each Ticket 5s.'</p>
<p>  York Buildings was another favourite concert room, as

<pb n="38" id="p.38"/>
 was also Hickford's Dancing Room. This latter place, being at the extreme West End of London, bid for aristocratic patrons, and the prices were high; indeed, the tickets for the following concert were the highest priced of any I have ever met with: '<date value="1707">1707</date> To Morrow being Wednesday the 2nd of April, Signior Fr. Conti will cause to be perform'd at Mr. Hickford's Dancing Room in James Street, in the Hay Market over against the Tennis Court, the Consort of Musick compos'd by him for her Majesty, and which he had the Honour to have perform'd at Court the Day after the Act for the Union<note place="foot" n="17">The Royal Assent to this Act was given March 6, <date value="1707">1707</date>.</note> pass'd. Signiora Margarita, the Baroness, and Signior Valentino will sing in it accompanied with several Instruments, and the Signior Conti will play upon his great Theorbo, and on the Mandoline, an instrument not known yet. The Consort will begin at 7 a Clock at Night. Tickets to be had only at White's Chocolate House, and at the Smyrna Coffee House at a Guinea a ticket.' A high price-but consider the attractions. All the available talent, together with a Monstre Instrument, and an entirely novel one!</p>
<p>  Nowadays we should hardly expect concerts to be given at Chelsea Hospital, but it was different then, and ' Ladies of Quality' probably had as much influence then as they have now, and could get pretty well what they liked: '<date value="1702">1702</date> In Honour of the Queens Coronation; The Ladies Consort of Musick; by Subscription of several Ladies of Quality (by permission) at the Royal College of Chelsea, on Monday the
25th of the present May, is to be performed once, a new Consort of Musick, by Mr. Abel and other voices; with Instrumental Musick of all sorts; To be placed in two several Quires on each side of the Hall; a manner never yet performed in England. The Hall to be well illuminated ; the said Consort to begin exactly at five a Clock, and to hold 3 full hours. Each Ticket 5s. Notice that the Moon will shine, the Tide serve, and a Guard placed from the College to St. James's Park, for the safe return of the Ladies.'
</p><p>  The moon and tide were important factors then, as we find in a notice of 'a Consort of Musick' at Richmond Wells,

<pb id="p.39" n="39"/> Aug. 12, <date value="1703">1703</date>: 'This Consort to be perform'd but once, because of the Queen's going to the Bath. Note. The Tide serves at 11 o'clock in the Morning and Light Nights.' So that the visitors were evidently expected to spend the whole day there.</p>
<p>  Another suburban Spa (Hampstead) was famous for its concerts, and continued in favour during the whole of the reign.</p>
<p>  '<date value="1705">1705</date> On Saturday August the 4th In the great Room at the Ship Tavern Greenwich will be an extraordinary Consort of Vocal and Instrumental Musick, viz., Several Songs set by the best Masters; Particularly a Song of two parts by Mr. Henry Purcel, never perform'd but once before in Publick,' etc.
</p><p>  Towards the latter end of the reign the character of some of these concerts seem to be altering. Take one at Stationers' Hall, Feb. 22, <date value="1715">1715</date>, for instance: 'Among other choice Compositions, a celebrated Song of Mr. Hendel's by a Gentlewoman from Abroad, who hath never before exposed her Voice publickly in this kingdom. To which will be added an uncommon piece of Musick by Bassoons only. Country Dances when the Consort is over; and such a Decorum kept that the most innocent may be present without the danger of an Affront.'
</p><p>  Concerts, as we see, were both vocal and instrumental. Of the vocal performers much has already been said; of the instrumental, none are worth notice, except Gasparini, an Italian, who was an excellent violinist. The last and perhaps the least of them was: 'A Boy of about Eight Years of Age will perform an Italian Sonata on the Trumpet, who never yet perform'd in publick.' This musical treat took place at York Buildings, Feb. 24, <date value="1703">1703</date>.
</p><p>  The instruments in domestic use were the chamber or house organ, many of which were frequently advertised for sale, the spinet, and harpsichord, or harpsicalls, which we know so well, thanks to the South Kensington Museum. Here, however, is a rare one: 'To be disposed of, a most excellent Harpsicord made by the Famous Sign. Gieronimo Senti, at Pesaro in Italy, having 2 Extraordinary fine Keys of Ivory, several Stops and Alterations besides the 2 Principals,
<pb n="40" id="p.40"/>
 and one Octave, or the Spinet, which may be plaid seperately or together, imitating most exactly the Theorba, and most curiously the Arch Lute.' The flute was played, as were also the lute, and the theorbo, a lute-like instrument. The other stringed instruments were the bass viol and the violin, Cremonas being then, as now, highly prized.
</p><p>  It was essentially an age for chamber music, with nice little social gatherings, at which were played duets on the flute, etc., or catches, rounds, and three-part songs were sung. What we should call good music was thoroughly appreciated, and Corelli, perhaps, was then the favourite composer. The following advertisement will show the class of music then in vogue (<date value="1706">1706</date>): 'To all Lovers of Musick. This day are published, and to be sold at Isaac Vaillant's Book and Mapseller in the Strand near Catherine Street, Per.<note place="foot" n="18">?

These books are printed by Steph Roger, most of them on Royal Paper. At the abovesaid Vaillant's may be had the new Edition of Corelli printed on Imperial Paper pr 32s. 6d.'
</p><p>  But all music was not as dear as this-for instance: 'The Monthly Mask of Vocal Musick: the newest Songs, made for the Theatres and other occasions Compos'd by Mr. John Welden and Mr. Dan Purcel. Publish'd for November, which collections will be continued monthly for the year <date value="1703">1703</date> pr. 6d. Also a Set of Lessons for the Harpsicord or Spinnet.

</p><p>  Music was printed either from engraved copper plates, as in the case of 'The Nightingale,' which was engraved by Thomas Cross, who worked in the very early part of the century, or by movable types, as is the case with all music
   <pb id="p.41" n="41"/>
 taken from 'The Dancing Master.' But the Dutch hit upon a cheaper plan, and made use of pewter plates, which they stamped, and so were able to undersell the engraved music. It is said they got 1,500&#x00A3;. by printing the opera of 'Rinaldo.' One Richard Mears also engraved music, but he, finding his trade interfered with by the Dutchmen, took to stamping. At his death in <date value="1743">1743</date> almost the whole of the music printing in the country was done by the son of the following advertiser: <note place="foot" n="19">Tatler, 88.</note>

<p>THE sister art of painting was not well represented in this reign-by native talent, at all events, except by Thornhill. There was Wollaston, a portrait painter, who could only command five guineas for a three-quarters canvas: he was one of Britton's amateurs, and played both violin and flute. He died at an old age in the Charter House. Thomas Murray was another portrait painter.
</p><p>   There was Hugh Howard, to whom Prior indited an ode commencing,
           <quote rend="blockquote"><l>Dear Howard, from the soft assaults of love,</l>
           <l>Poets and painters never are secure;</l>

          <l> Or thou draw beauty, and not feel its power ?</l>
</quote> He was lucky, for through his acquaintances of high rank he obtained the situation of Keeper of the State Papers, and Paymaster of His Majesty's Palaces, when he still followed the pursuit of art, by collecting prints and medals.
 </p><p>  Lewis Crosse was a painter in water colours, and executed miniatures.  He also collected them, and his very valuable collection was sold in <date value="1722">1722</date>, two years before his death. Luke Cradock, who was but a house painter, rose by his own exertions to be an excellent painter of birds, and, like H. S. Marks, Esq., R.A., his works were highly prized for

<pb n="43" id="p.43"/>
 house decorations. According to Vertue, his pictures, soon after his death, fetched three or four times the prices paid for them.</p>
<p>  Charles Jervas, who lived in this reign, and had been a pupil of Kneller, was a very good painter. He taught Pope to draw and paint, and Pope wrote an 'Epistle to Mr. Jervas,' in which he belauded him, as did also Steele  <note place="foot" n="1">Tatler, No. 4.</note> when he called him the last great painter Italy has sent us, Mr. Jervas'alluding to his return from studying in Italy. He married a widow worth 20,000&#x00A3;., and the praise he received with the affluence of his circumstances rendered him inordinately vain, as the two following anecdotes will show. He made a good copy of a Titian, and he thought he had actually outdone that master; for, looking from one to the other, he complacently observed, 'Poor little Tit! how he would stare !' The Duchess of Bridgewater sat to him for her portrait, that picture of which Pope says-</p><p>
            <quote rend="blockquote"><l> With Zeuxis' Helen thy Bridgewater vie</l></quote>

-and he remarked that she had not a handsome ear. Her ladyship asked him his opinion of what was a handsome ear, to which his answer was - showing her one of his own.
</p><p>  Jonathan Richardson was, perhaps, the best English portrait painter of his time; and, after the deaths of Kneller and Dahl, stood prominent in that branch of his profession. Aikman and Alexander were also contemporary artists.
</p><p>  But perhaps the English artist of that time best known to us is Sir James Thornhill; not only by his painting in the dome of St. Paul's, but by his masterpiece in the Hall of Greenwich Hospital. Indeed he was a worthy rival both of Verrio and Laguerre. Forty shillings per square yard was all he got for painting St. Paul's, and probably no more for Greenwich. For his decorations at Blenheim he only received twenty-five shillings per square yard; and the Directors of the South Sea Company would pay him no more for the work he did on their staircase and hall. There are a few other English painters, but they were of no note. Of foreign artists in England, doubtless the greatest was

<pb n="44" id="p.44"/>
 Kneller, who was born at Lubeck in <date value="1648">1648</date>. He came over here in <date value="1674">1674</date>, without the least intention of stopping; but, having painted Charles II. and established a reputation, he made this country his home. Knighted by William, petted by Anne, baroneted by George I., he could scarcely expect greater honours. His principal works in Anne's reign were a bad portrait of the King of Spain, who paid a visit to the Queen, and was kept some time longer than he expected, by stress of weather; seven portraits of admirals at Hampton Court, and the portraits of the Kit Cat Club, which have already been noticed. He was as vain as Jervas, if not more so. Pope tried to see to what extent his vanity would go.
'Sir Godfrey, I believe if God Almighty had had your assistance, the world would have been formed more perfect.'
''Fore Gad, Sir, I believe so too,' was the self-satisfied reply. He, however, was not devoid of wit, as his little encounter with Dr. Ratcliffe proves. They lived next to each other, and there was a door between the two gardens. Through this door Ratcliffe's servants used to come and pick Kneller's flowers; so the painter sent word that he would have the door shut. A message came from the doctor that 'he might do anything with it but paint it,' to which the artist replied that 'he would take anything from him but his physic.' Kneller was painting the portrait of James II., which was to be a present to Pepys, when the King received the news of the landing of the Prince of Orange. He ordered the painter to proceed with his work, so that 'his good friend Pepys should not be disappointed.'
</p><p>  When Sir Godfrey moved from his house in Covent Garden, he had a sale of pictures, probably of little artistic value, or only copies.1 'At the late Dwelling House of Sir Godfrey Kneller, in the Piazza's, Covent Garden, will be sold a Collection of Original Paintings, fit for Stair Cases, Chimneys, Doors or Closets. Some of the Masters they were done by are as follows: viz. Holben, Ruben, Van Dyke, Sr. Peter Lely, Antonio de Cortona, Solveta, Rosa, Snider, Vander Velde, Rostraten, Bombodes, Verelst and several

 other great Masters.' This auction was a failure: 'This is to give notice, That the Collection, &#x0026;c., will be Sold out of hand at very reasonable Rates at the above mentioned place, beginning this present Monday being the 27th of March, the badness and uncertainty of the Weather having put a stop to the Auction.' <note place="foot" n="3">Daily Courant, March 27, <date value="1704">1704</date>. </note>
</p><p>  John Closterman was the artist who painted the wholelength portrait of Queen Anne, now in the Guildhall. We get several notices of him from the newspapers: 'Mr. Closterman being obliged at Christmas next to go to Hannover, and afterwards to several Courts of Germany; so that it is uncertain whether he will ever return to England. Such Persons of Quality and others, as have lately sate to him, are desired to take notice, that their Pictures will be finished out of hand, and deliver'd as they shall best please to order them.' <note place="foot" n="2">Ibid. Aug. 6, <date value="1705">1705</date></note>
</p><p>  In April of the next year he advertised that 'being oblig'd to leave England very suddenly, will sell all his pictures by Auction.' He had another sale of pictures on Feb. 28, <date value="1711">1711</date>, which was probably after his death, the date of which is somewhat uncertain. He had married a worthless girl, who robbed him of all he possessed, and then ran away: this sent him mad, and he soon afterwards died.
</p><p>  Antonio Pelegrini made several designs for painting the dome of St. Paul's, and was paid for them. He painted staircases, etc., for the Dukes of Manchester and Portland, and for other noblemen. He died abroad.
</p><p>  His master, Sebastian Ricci, came over here, and painted the altarpiece in the chapel of Chelsea College; but he, too, did not stop. Not so James Bogdani, a native of Hungary, who lived here between forty and fifty years. He painted fruit, flowers, and birds, and our royal palaces still possess examples of this master, which were purchased by Queen Anne.

His forte was game. He

<pb n="46" id="p.46"/>
 painted a piece of still life-a violin- on a door at Devonshire House, Piccadilly, that deceived everybody. This is now at Chatsworth.
</p><p>   Pope's line, 'Where sprawl the Saints of Verrio and
 Laguerre,' naturally makes us think of these two masters, and
 many were the ceilings which the latter painted in England.
 He enjoyed royal patronage under both William and Anne,
 designing for the latter some tapestry, illustrative of the
 union between England and Scotland, in which were portraits
 of the Queen and her ministers. He did the drawings, but
 the tapestry was not made. His end was sudden: he died
 of apoplexy in <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName> Theatre, whither he had gone to
 attend the benefit of his son, who sang there in ' The Island
 Princess.'  <note place="foot" n="4">By P. A. Motteux.</note>
</p><p>   Michael Dahl was a Swede, and a mighty portrait painter. He was Kneller's rival, and yet they must have been friends, for Sir Godfrey painted his portrait. He was a great pet of Prince George of Denmark, and was also patronised by the Queen.
</p><p>  Any account of the artists of this reign would be sadly incomplete without mention of Boit, the enameller, who was certainly the best, up to that time, after Petitot or Zincke. He got large sums for his miniatures. Several now exist, and one, especially good, of Queen Anne sitting, and Prince George standing beside her, is at Kensington Palace. The most important work on which he was engaged during his stay in England was a large plate, about 24 in. by 18, for which Laguerre painted the design in oil. It represented the Queen, Prince George, and the principal members of the Court, with Victory introducing the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene; France and Bavaria were prostrate, and there were the usual military accompaniment of standards and trophies of arms. He got an advance of 1,000&#x00A3;, and spent &#x00A3; 700 or
&#x00A3; 800 of it in erecting furnaces able to fire so large a plate; and, when he began to lay on colour, he got another advance of
&#x00A3; 700. Then came the memorable disgrace of Marlborough, and he was ordered to change Marlborough into Ormonde, and Victory into Peace. Prince Eugene would not sit, and

 no further progress was ever made with the picture. Boit ran away, on the Queen's death, much in debt, and got to France, where they were only too glad to receive him. There he died in <date value="1726">1726</date>.
</p><p>  Those were not, as now, golden days for artists, who never dreamed of living in luxuriously furnished mansions of their own building. There were no exhibitions of art, nor did the middle class indulge much in oil paintings, which were principally confined to originals, or copies, of the Italian or Dutch and Flemish schools. Of course every gentleman who made the 'grand tour' brought some home with him, if only to show his taste in such matters; and, through the fluctuations of fortune, there was generally a good supply of them in the market. The following extract from Swift's Journal to Stella will give some idea of the price of a copy, for it is scarcely likely to have been an original. '6 Mar. <date value="1713">1713</date>. I was to day at an auction of pictures with Pratt, and laid out two pounds five Shillings for a picture of Titian, and if it were a Titian it would be worth twice as many pounds. If I am cheated, I'll part with it to Lord Masham; if it be a bargain, I'll keep it to myself. That's my conscience.'
</p><p>  To give an idea of the range of art which these pictures occupied, let us take the names of the masters, with their spellings, as they appear in the advertisements. Italian. Giorgione da Castle Franco, Titian, Palma, Tintoret, Bassan, Cavalieri Gioseppi d'Arpino, Paulo Faranati, Camillo Procacino, Spaniolette, Bartolemeo, Pordenone, Andrea del Sarto, Leonardo da Vinci, Paulo Veronese, Gaspar Poussin, Julio Romano, Pollydore, Parmigiano, Baptista Franca, Corregio, Primaticcio, Schiavone, Claud Lorain, Fran, Bolognese, Mola, the Borgognon, Luca Jordano, Bourdon, Perosini, Scacciati, Daudini, Tempesto, and Guido Guavini.
</p><p>  Among the Dutch and Flemish Masters were: Van Dyke, Quentin Messias, Ostervelt, Vander Werff, Van de Velde, Cornelius Johnson, Vander Meer, Brayuinx, Griffiere Backhuysen, De Wit, Brawer, Wyck, Ostade, Hondecoeter, Saftleven, Boc, Percellus, Ryzeberg, Bloemoert, Youngfranc, Bramer, Verelst, Palamedus, Levintz, Ruysdail, Hemskirk, Breughel, Holben, Rubens, Berchem, and Teniers.
<pb n="48" id="p.48"/>

</p><p>   And we have one advertisement where 'Among them are
 Portraicts a half length of the Queen of England  <note place="foot" n="5">Either Mary of Modena, Consort of James II., or Queen Mary.</note> by Ryly;
 Sir Tho More; Lord Cicil in Queen Elizabeth's time, and the
 Lord Francis Bacon.'
</p><p>   People who could not afford oil paintings might buy
 water colours, and the following gives us the names of two
 famous artists: 'A choice collection of Limnings, by Mr.
 Cooper and old Mr. Hoskins now in the possession of his Son
 John Hoskins of Chelsea, will be sold by Auction. Likewise
 several Boxes of Limning Colours,' etc. These were, in all
 probability, miniatures.
</p><p>   Drawings, both in crayon and black lead, line engravings, and etchings were within the compass of most people's purses,
 and here is an advertisement which would create some interest
 even now at Christie's. 'At the Eagle and Child in Bedford
 Street, Covent Garden, &#x0026;c. will be continued the Sale by
 Auction of a collection of Paintings, Drawings, and Prints,
 by the most famous Italian, and other great Masters. The
 Drawings are of the most celebrated Masters of the several
 Schools of Italy. A great number of them in Frames and
 Glasses. The Prints are in great perfection, a great many
 Etcht by the Masters themselves, others graved by the most
 eminent Gravers. There are a great many extraordinary rare
 Wood Cuts, they have been collecting these 30 Years with
 great industry and expense, most out of the chiefest Auctions
 in England, and others bought in Holland and France, by
 Mr. William Gibson, <note place="foot" n="2"> A miniature painter, pupil of Sir Peter Lely, and nephew of Gibson, the dwarf painter.
</note> Limner.'
</p><p>   We know the engravings of that time were very good: they were also very cheap, and of good subjects. ' You may have the Right Originals after the greatest Masters, as Raphael, Michael Angelo, Ruben, Julij Romana, all well graven, and
30 sorts of Altarpieces and Prints ready framed;' or one might buy 'A compleat Sett of the Prints of the Royal Palaces and Noblemen's Seats in England, neatly bound up together, or sold Singly for 1s. apiece; and likewise a curious Collection of Italian and French prints, particularly the Original Battles


<pb n="49" id="p.49"/>
 of Alexander; the Galleries of Luxemburgh; Poussin's Landskips, and many others.' Good English Engravers were then very scarce: nearly all the illustrations to books were engraved by foreigners, and very frequently in Holland.
</p><p>  Take the following for example-engraved in England, but by a foreigner: ' The Seven Cartons of Raphael d'Urbin drawn and engrav'd from the Originals in the Gallery at Hampton Court by S. Gribelin, are sold by C. Mather near Temple Bar in Fleet Street &#x0026;c.-price 15s.' There was another set of these engraved in <date value="1711">1711</date> and <date value="1712">1712</date>, by Michael Dorigny, who offered eight plates 19 in. by 25 to 30 for four guineas. Steele gives this venture a kindly puff in Spectator 226.
</p><p>  Sculpture was not at a premium, there being but one sculptor at all worthy of the name (of course except Gibbons), and he was Francis Bud, to whom, among other works, we owe the statue of Queen Anne in St. Paul's Churchyard, and the Conversion of St. Paul in the pediment of the cathedral.
</p><p>   The virtuosi got their statuary from Italy, and of course these classical gentlemen would be satisfied with nothing less than 'right Antiques.' ' Four Marble Figures lately come from Italy, with 2 half bodies. The Figures are Jupiter and Venus, Bacchus and his Mistress.'
</p><p>   There was a demand for plaster and leaden casts for garden ornamentation, and this was met by one Van Nost, who lived in ' Hide Park Road, near the Queen's Mead House,' who had a fine collection, which was sold after his death, in <date value="1712">1712</date>. His widow also sold, at a great reduction in price,' the fine Marble Figures and Bustos, curious inlaid Marble Tables, Brass and Leaden Figures and very rich Vauses.'
</p><p>   Grinling Gibbons, of course, bears the palm in the matter of carving in this age, and we must not forget that he carved in stone and marble as well as in wood. The statue of Charles II. in the old Royal Exchange, the base of Charles the First's statue at Charing Cross, and the marble pedestal of the equestrian statue of Charles II. at Windsor, together with the magnificent tomb of Baptist Noel, Viscount Camden, in the church of Exton, Rutlandshire, all testify to his ability when dealing with the more obdurate materials. As to his wood carvings, they are most numerous and widely spread.


<pb n="50" id="p.50"/>
 In the choir of St. Paul's, at Chatsworth, at Burleigh, at Petworth, etc., are triumphs of his skill.
</p><p>   From sculpture to architecture is but a step; and a reign that can boast of two such architects as Wren and Vanbrugh must of necessity rank high as favouring this art. If Wren had built nothing else but St. Paul's, his fame would have been immortal, and the other buildings with which he beautified London, thanks to the great fire, cannot add lustre to his name. In the architecture of his churches he was very uneven; but it must not be forgotten that he had at that time so much work on hand, that thorough originality could not be expected in every case, and also, in very many instances he was hampered as to the expense. Not that he was an extravagant architect.  The man who could build (even taking money at its different value then and now) St. Mary Aldermary for a little over 5,000&#x00A3;., or St. Mary-le-Bow for
8,000&#x00A3;.-exclusive of the steeple, which cost nearly 1,400&#x00A3;. more-could not be accused of extravagance. We owe to him the Monument, Greenwich and Chelsea Hospitals, the Theatre and Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, and the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, besides a large number of churches, all still existing, and the Royal Exchange and Temple Bar, destroyed. In this reign he was thoroughly appreciated and honoured; was knighted by Anne, was President of the Royal Society, and sat twice in Parliament; and it was reserved to the Whigs in George the First's reign to deprive him of his places, and leave him uncared for in his old age.
</p><p>  The versatile Vanbrugh, who could be playwright or architect, poet, theatrical manager, or king-at-arms, adds much to the lustre of Anne's reign.
</p><p>  We have seen how Swift lampooned him on the building of his own house at Whitehall (vol. i. p. 61), and we all know Dr. Evans' epitaph upon him:-
               <quote rend="blockquote"><l> Lie heavy on him, earth, for he</l>
                <l>Laid many a heavy load on thee.</l></quote> That he was as great an architect as Wren, cannot be for a moment entertained; but that he was not without good taste and scientific knowledge, his two best works, Blenheim and Castle Howard, testify.</p>

<p> EXACT science, as we understand the term, hardly existed. Sir Isaac Newton was just lighting the spark which has been fanned by succeeding generations into such a mighty flame. The Royal Society was an absolute laughing-stock, and men called virtuosi pottered about, looking (and doubtless thinking they were) mighty wise.

'tis as light as a Cobweb. Then he usher'd us among sundry sorts of Serpents, as the Noy, Pelongy, Rattle Snake, Aligator, Crocodile &#x0026;c.

 </p><p>  The higher branches of mathematics were also publicly taught in <date value="1705">1705</date>: 'On Tuesday next being the 2nd Day of October, at the Marine Coffee house in Birchin Lane, Mr. Harris will go on with the Public Mathematic Lecture; beginning them with Geometry anew; and he will explain largely the Uses of all the Propositions, as he goes along: with a particular regard to the principles of true Mechanick Philosophy.' This latter was highly necessary, for mechanics were in an exceedingly elementary state: even such a common thing as a wind dial was new, and wonderful, in
<date value="1706">1706</date>. 'The WIND DIAL, lately set up at Grigsby's Coffee and Chocolate House, behind the Royal Exchange, being the first and only one in any publick House in England, and having given great Satisfaction to all that have seen it, and being of Constant use to those that are in any wise Concerned in Navigation: We think it may not be improper to describe it to the Publick, viz. The Dial Board is fixed to the Ceiling of the Publick Ground room, upon which are all the points of the Compass in Gold Letters, and a Hand Points to each of them, continually as the Wind varies. The Hand is directed by an Iron work, which is turned by a Fan placed
90 foot high, to prevent the effects of Eddy Winds.'
 </p><p>  Condensing sea water, in order to make it potable, is, if an old invention, quite a modern practice; yet we see it in use in <date value="1705">1705</date>. 'Mr. Walcot's Engines for making Sea Water Fresh and Wholesome, are sold by him at his Warehouse in Woolpack Alley in Houndsditch at reasonable rates being of great use and advantage for all Ships, especially such as go long voyages.'
 </p><p>  Perhaps the best method of gauging the mechanical genius of the age is to examine the patents granted, and, as they are very few in this reign, a short list of them will fulfil this condition, and yet not be wearisome.
 </p><p> Jan. I, <date value="1703">1703</date>. A grant to George Sorocold, gent., of a new invention by him contrived and found out, for cutting and sawing all kinds of boards, timber, and stone, and

These are all the mechanical patents worthy of notice during Anne's reign. Hydraulic machinery was particularly useful, and attention was specially paid to its perfection. Here is the record<note place="foot" n="4">Daily Courant, Nov. 11, <date value="1713">1713</date>.</note>  of a draining feat happily completed:
'The Lands in    Havering and Dagenham Levels in Essex, having lain these 6 Years under Water, were, after a great deal of Industry and Expence happily recovered on the 29th Day of October past, being the same Day 6 years that that Breach happened. The Gentlemen concerned in that Undertaking have given to the Artificers and Labourers an Ox and a Sheep to be
 Roasted whole, and a Hog to be barbicui'd, with large Puddings in their Bellies, on the 13th of this present Instant, on the said Works.' But few people remember that the steam engine was a living and working fact, and a commercial commodity, in Queen Anne's time, and this owed its being to the general utility of hydraulic machinery. Salamon de Caus and the Marquis of Worcester are rivals as to the invention of a working steam engine, and Papin came very near to being successful, even going so far as to propel a ship with revolving

<pb n="59" id="p.59"/>
 oars or paddles, which could in speed beat the king's barge manned by sixteen rowers. But it was reserved to Savery to make it commercially valuable. In <date value="1698">1698</date> he took out a patent. 'A grant to Thomas Savery gentl, of the sole exercise of a new invention by him invented, for raising of water, and occasioning motion to all sorts of Mill Works, by the impellent force of fire, which will be of great use for draining mines, serving towns with water, and for the working of all sorts of Mills where they have not the benefit of water nor Constant winds, to hold for 14 years; with usual clauses. Testibus apud Westm. 25&#x00B0; die Julij anno supradeo.'
  </p><p> He could not have wasted much time in perfecting his invention and putting it on a sound commercial basis, for we find an advertisement in the Postman, March 28/31, <date value="1702">1702</date>:
' Captain Savery's Engines which raise Water by the force of Fire in any reasonable quantities and to any height, being now brought to perfection, and ready for publick use; These are to give notice to all Proprietors of Mines and Collieries which are encumbered with Water, that they may be furnished with Engines to drain the same, at his Work house in Salisbury Court, London, against the Old Play house, where it may be seen working on Wednesdays and Saturdays in every week from 3 to 6 in the afternoon; where they may be satisfied of the performance thereof, with less expence than any other force of Horse or Hands, and less subject to repair.'
  </p><p> He must, even then, have had some at work, for he says in the preface to his little work,  <note place="foot" n="5">The Miner's Friend, or, an Engine to raise Water by Fire described, &#x0026;c., by Thomas Savery, Gent. London. <date value="1702">1702</date>.</note> dated Sept. 22, <date value="1701">1701</date> : 'That the attending and working the Engine is so far from being so, <note place="foot" n="6">I.e. intricate and difficult to work.</note> that it is familiar and easie to be learned by those of the meanest Capacity, in a very little time; insomuch, that I have Boys of 13 or 14 years of Age, who now attend and work it to perfection, and were taught to do it in a few days; and I have known some learn to work the Engine in half-an-hour.'
  </p><p>  He had visions of its future power, and knew somewhat of its vast capabilities: 'Whereas this Engine may be made


<pb n="60" id="p.60"/>
 large enough to do the work required in employing eight, ten, fifteen, or twenty horses to be constantly maintained and kept for doing such a work; it will be improper to stint or confine its Uses and Operation in respect of Water Mills.' He then suggests that it would pump water to the top of a house, for domestic supply, for fountains, and in case of fire-or supply towns with water, draining fens, mines, and coal pits, nay, he even suggests their use, through the furnace and shaft, as ventilators.  More than all, he says, 'I believe it may be made very useful to Ships, but I dare not meddle with that matter; and leave it to the Judgment of those who are the best Judges of Maritain Affairs.'
 </p><p> His engine was as ingenious as it was simple. Two boilers with furnaces supplied the steam. This was admitted alternately, by means of a handle worked by a man or boy, into one of two elliptical receivers, where it condensed, formed a vacuum, and the water rushed in and filled its place-the same principle which is the foundation of that invaluable feed-pump, Giffard's injector. When full, the application of steam ejected it from the receiver, and forced it up the pipe, and so de novo. His idea was to utilise the water thus raised to turn a water-wheel, and thus get effective power for working machinery in mills.

<p> WELL might the time of Anne be called the Augustan age of literature. The writers of that day have lived till ours, and will live, and be quoted as models of purity of style, as long as, and wherever, the English language is spoken. In what other age can such a wealth of literary names be found as Addison, Steele, Swift, Pope, Warburton, Gay, Prior, Parnell, Defoe, Vanbrugh, Congreve, Rowe! It was the grand awakening of letters; and, having good food provided for them, the people appreciated it, and it undoubtedly laid the foundation of the present reading age. Before this time there had been no books, i.e. adapted to the general public, to read. Truly, there were scholars here and there, and the Universities were ever fountains of learning; but literature had not entered into every-day life, and we have to thank Steele and Addison, who charmed the public taste by their social and moral essays, into becoming first a reading, and then a thinking, people.

 as materials for his history of printing--which never was written-look at the treasures that have come down to us in the Cotton, Harleian, Royal, and Lambeth libraries r A sale like that of the Sunderland library  <note place="foot" n="1">The Duke of Marlborough's collection, sold <date value="1882">1882</date></note> convulses the literary world, and buyers come from all parts of the globe. Then, however, an advertisement like this was not uncommon ::
'A curious Collection of Books, which was Collected by a great Antiquarian, in Greek, Latin, Spanish, French, Italian, and English, in all Faculties and Sciences, many of them very scarce, of the best Authors and Editions, as Aldus, Stevens, Elzevir and others,' etc.
  </p><p> We learn from Misson the state of our public libraries. He says: 'At present I know but three publick ones in this City; those of the Chapter at Westminster, and Sion College
(which are very much neglected, and in a sorry Condition in all Respects) and that which Dr. Tenison, Archbishop of Canterbury, has lately founded. The two former are going to Decay, and the latter is not yet quite form'd. Neither the one nor the other are much frequented. The King's Library at St. James's is also in a miserable state; I am told, that Dr. Bentley, who has the keeping of it, in the room of Mr. Instel, does all he can to restore it; but his Endeavours will be to no purpose, unless the Master of it has Leisure and Will to have an Eye to it himself. There have been Books in Pawn in the Hands of the Binders I know not how many Years. King Charles II. did but laugh at it. It is, nevertheless, a Pity that so many good Books, and so well bound, should be given up to the Mould and Moisture of the Air, to Moths and to Dust. The Library of Sir Robert Cotton is particularly famous for Manuscripts. The Royal Society have begun to Collect a pretty good one: the late Duke of Norfolk, who was of it, left them his. There are a great many Noble men in England that love Books, and have good Collections of them.'
 </p><p>  A literary curiosity of this reign deserves to be, and must be, noticed. It is George Psalmanazar, the impostor who, for a while, deceived the majority of the English literati. He seems to have been born in France in <date value="1679">1679</date>, and to have
           .


<pb n="63" id="p.63"/>
 received a good education. He wandered about as a pilgrim, and that either not paying, or else being dissatisfied with the life, he hit upon the extraordinary idea of passing himself off as a Formosan, and to do this he actually had to invent a new language and grammar. Accompanied by a clergyman named Innes, he came over to England, where he translated the Church Catechism into pretended Formosan, and he published a History of Formosa, and of his own adventures; but the suspicions of the learned were aroused, and he was unmasked. He tried to fight against it for some time, and issued advertisements in the papers, that he could be seen, spoken with, and catechised, but to no purpose. He afterwards lived by doing hack work for the booksellers, and at his death he thoroughly confessed his imposture.
 </p><p>  The hack writers of the time are thus humorously described in the Guardian (No. 58): 'According as my necessities suggest it to me, I hereby provide for my being. The last summer I paid a large debt for brandy and tobacco, by a wonderful description of a fiery dragon, and lived for ten days together upon a whale and a mermaid. When winter draws near, I generally conjure up my spirits, and have my apparition ready against long dark evenings. From November last to January I lived solely upon murders; and have, since that time, had a comfortable subsistence from a plague and a famine. I made the Pope pay for my Beef and Mutton last Lent, out of pure spite to the Romish Religion; and at present my good friend the King of Sweden finds me in clean linen, and the Mufti gets me credit at the Tavern.'
 </p><p>  Literary men had their money troubles then as nowprobably not more so-as many a melancholy tale of modern Grub Street could tell. Swift's society did some good. Take his Journal to Stella, Feb. 12 and 13, <date value="1713">1713</date>, as an example:
'I gave an account of Sixty guineas I had collected, and am to give them away to two Authors to-morrow, and lord Treasurer has promised me a hundred pounds to reward some others. ... I found a letter on my table last night to tell me that poor little Harrison . . . was ill, and desired to see me at night. ... I went in the morning, and found him mighty ill, and got thirty guineas for him from Lord Bolin-
<pb n="64" id="p.64"/>
 broke, and an order for a hundred pounds from the treasury to be paid him to-morrow. ... I was to see a poor poet, one Mr. Diaper, in a nasty garret, very sick. I gave him twenty guineas from Lord Bolinbroke, and disposed the other sixty to two other authors.' This was practical benevolence, but its record only shows the sad necessity there was for its exercise.
 </p><p>  Other troubles they had, and perhaps not the least of them was the fear of personal violence. They hit hard in those days, and people did not always take their castigation meekly. Sometimes they took the law into their own hands, and then woe be to the unfortunate author. Samuel Johnson
(author of Julian) in Charles the Second's reign was not only publicly whipped, but was nearly murdered in his own house. Tutchin, too, who wrote a poem on the death of James II., was waylaid, and so frightfully beaten that he died from its effects. Defoe also frequently mentions attempts to injure him. So Swift wrote to Stella,<note place="foot" n="2">Journal, June 30, <date value="1711">1711</date>.</note> 'No, no, I'll walk late no more; I ought to venture it less than other people, and so I was told.'

  </p><p> When Anne succeeded to the throne on March 8, I702, the following newspapers were in existence: The London Post, English Post, Postman, Postboy, Flying Post, London Gazette, Post Angel, New State of Europe, and Dawks's and Dyer's News Letter (the former of which was printed in script letters, to look as much as possible like writing). The whole of these were issued three times a week; but three days after Anne's accession came out the first daily paper in
 <pb id="p.65" n="65"/>
 England.   The Daily Courant was born March 11 , <date value="1702">1702</date>, and this little fledgling, the precursor of the mighty daily press, measures but 14 in. by 8 in. It is printed only on one side of the sheet: the reason given for which is, to say the least, peculiar, reminding one of the lines :
           <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>My wound is great, because it is so small.</l>
           <l> Then were it greater, were it none at all.</l></quote>
' This Courant (as the Title shews) will be Publish'd Daily; being design'd to give all the Material News as soon as every

 Post arrives; and is confin'd to half the Compass, to save the Publick at least half the Impertinences of Ordinary News Papers.' Probably the correct reason was that, being a new venture, it could not obtain advertisements. These, however, speedily came when it passed into the hands of Samuel Buckley (printer of the Spectator), and, in May, it was in a most flourishing state, the other side being entirely taken up with them, and it continued to have its fair share during the whole of the reign. There is nothing very striking about its news, but, as it is such a wonderful infant, I have repro-
<pb n="66" id="p.66"/>
 duced this first number in its entirety, in the Appendix, <note place="foot" n="4">See Appendix.</note> where it will serve as a model to show the kind of news contained in these newspapers. There now exist but two newspapers which were in being in Queen Anne's reign, namely, the London Gazette (but that has been kept alive through its official nursing), and-but one due to private enterprise- Berrow's Worcester Journal, which was established in <date value="1709">1709</date>.
  </p><p> The other papers born in this reign, including the Satirical and Essay papers, are The Observator, Gazette de Londres, Monthly   Register, Letter   Writer,  Whitehall, Rehearsal, Diverting Post, A Weekly Review of the Affairs of France, by Daniel De Foe, Whipping Post, News Letter, General Remarks on Trade, Mercurius Politicus, St. James's, Kensington, Evening Post, A  Review  of the State of the British Nation, The Weekly Comedy, Generous Advertiser, Humours of a Coffee House, The British Apollo, Tatler, Athenian  News, Examiner, Medley, Moderator, Evening Courant, British Mercury. Protestant Postboy, Hermit, Useful Intelligencer, Night Post, Spectator, Plain Dealer, Guardian, The Reconciler, The Mercator, Englishman, Britain, The Lover, The Patriot, Controller, Weekly Packet, Monitor.
   </p><p>It would be a waste of time to follow the fortunes of all these papers; suffice it to say, that the majority of them had but a brief existence, and let us note only a few of the prominent ones.   First of all the London Gazette, of which Misson says 'it is the truest and most Cautious of all the Gazettes that I know. It inserts no news but what is Certain, and often waits for the Confirmation of it, before it publishes it.' It was first published on Feb. 1, <date value="1666">1666</date>, and still continues to this day as the official newspaper. It was first printed by Thomas Newcomb, of the Savoy, then by Edward Jones, who died in <date value="1705">1705</date>. From Feb. 18 of that year to Feb. 26, <date value="1708">1708</date>, it was printed by his widow, M. Jones. At the latter date, it appears as printed by J. Tonson, at Gray's Inn Gate, who, although he moved into the Strand, continued to print it during the remainder of the reign. It was somewhat smaller than the other papers, and its normal price was 1d., but, if of extra size, owing to addresses

<pb n="67" id="p.67"/>
 to the Queen, etc., it was 2d. It was published twice weekly, and was the only one of the newspapers that kept up the old style of reckoning time. It did not begin the new year till after March 25; thus, for the year <date value="1702">1702</date>, all the Gazettes would be <date value="1701">1701</date> till March 25, after which they would be <date value="1702">1702</date> till that same date in <date value="1703">1703</date>.
  </p><p> When Samuel Buckley took the Daily Courant in hand, he at once filled it with advertisements. He then lived at the Dolphin, in Little Britain; afterwards at Amen Corner. Either he sold the Courant, or gave up printing it, for on Sept.
, <date value="1714-09-25">1714</date>, it was 'Printed by S. Gray, sold by Ferd. Burleigh in Amen Corner.' Perhaps he could not attend to two papers at once, for, on the copy of the London Gazette for Sept. 25/28, <date value="1714">1714</date>, in the British Museum, is written 'first Gazette by Mr. Buckley.' Dunton<note place="foot" n="5"> The Life and Errors of John Dunton, Lond. <date value="1705">1705</date>.</note> says of him: 'He was Originally a Bookseller, but follows Printing. He is an excellent Linguist, understands the Latin, French, Dutch and Italian Tongues; and is Master of a great Deal of Wit. He prints The Dayly Courant and Monthly Register (which, I hear, he Translates out of the Foreign Papers himself).' Its usual price was 1d., but there was a special edition published. 'The News of every Post Day's Courant, is Constantly Printed with the News of the Day before, on a Sheet of Writing Paper, a Blank being left for the Conveniency of sending it by the Post. And may be had for 2d.' <note place="foot" n="6">Daily Courant, Sept. 21, <date value="1705">1705</date>.</note>
  </p><p> Dunton thought the Postboy was the best for English and Spanish news, but the Postman was the best for everything. A French Protestant, named Fonvive, wrote the latter, and in the early part of Anne's reign the Postboy was written by Thomas, afterwards by Boyer, also a foreigner, who had

<figure id="fig.00003" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.006.DO01.00003"><head>'London Gazettes here!'</head></figure>


<pb n="68" id="p.68"/>
 been tutor to the young Duke of Gloucester. Swift writes of him: 'One Boyer, a French dog, has abused me in a pamphlet, and I have got him up in a Messenger's hands. The secretary promised me to swinge him. I must make that rogue an example to others.'
  </p><p> In the early days of the reign both these papers had manuscript postscripts, or supplements, when any fresh news arrived that was not in their last edition, they being published thrice weekly. 'This is to give Notice, that the Post Boy, with a Written Postscript, containing all the Domestick Occurrences, with the Translations of the Foreign News that arrives after the Printing of the said Post Boy, is to be had only of Mr. John Shank, at Nandoe's Coffee house, between the two Temple Gates; and at Mr. Abel Roper's at the Black Boy, over against St. Dunstan's Church in Fleet Street.'
'The Author of this Paper having several times declared in Print that he is no ways directly nor indirectly concerned in the Written Postscripts to the Post Man, nor any other News but what is printed therein; he thinks he has reason to complain of several People, who write to him from the Country about faults and mistakes contained in those Written Postscripts, putting him thereby to unnecessary Charges. He desires those Persons to forbear the same for the future, but if they are not satisfied with their written News (seeing they are not Contented with what is Printed), they may be furnished with written Postscripts at Tom's Coffee House in St. Martin's Lane, by a Person, who the Author hopes, will give them entire satisfaction.'
    </p><p>Later on in the century they printed these postscripts, but they were not safe even then. 'There being a Sham Postscript published last night, with an Advertisement, intending to impose the same upon people as a Postscript to the Postman, We think fit to desire again our Readers to buy no Postscripts to the Postman, but from the Hawkers they know, as the only means to stop that Villanous practice; and when there is any material New, we shall take care to publish a Postscript, provided it be a Post Day, and not too Late.' The Post Boy had two rough woodcuts, one on each side of the title: one of a Post boy on horseback, blowing his horn;


<pb n="69" id="p.69"/>
 the other a Fame, blowing a trumpet, on the banner of which is inscribed Viresque acquirit eundo; whilst the Postman has two woodcuts occupying the same position: one of a ship in full sail; the other of a post boy on horseback, blowing his horn. They are the same size as the Daily Courant.
'Dawks's News Letter, For Thirty Shillings a Year, paying a Quarter before Hand to J. Dawks at the West End of Thames Street by Wardrobe Stairs, near Puddle Dock,' was, as before said, printed in imitation of writing. It generally contained a little more domestic news than the other papers, and may be said to be the first evening paper. 'This News Letter continues to be published every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, in the Evening, and contains what is most Remarkable, in any (or all) of the other News Papers; to which is added the Occurrences of the Day, and the Heads of the Foreign Mails, which come in many times after the publication of the Printed Papers; and is so contrived, that a Blank Space is left for any Gentleman, or others, to write their private Business to their Friends in the Country, so that they may have therewith the Chiefest News stirring.' Ichabod Dawks started his News Letter on Aug. 4, <date value="1696">1696</date>. Steele mentions it more than once in the Tatler, notably No. 178, where he says:
'But Mr. Dawkes concluded his paper with a courteous sentence, which was very well taken, and applauded by the whole company. "We wish," says he, "all our Customers a merry Whitsuntide, and many of them." Honest Ichabod is as extraordinary a man as any of our fraternity, and as particular.'
  </p><p> The proprietor of the other news-letter, Dyer, got into trouble more than once. In <date value="1694">1694</date> he was summoned before the Parliament, and reprimanded by the Speaker 'for his great presumption' in printing the proceedings of the House. And once again, in <date value="1702">1702</date>, he was ordered to attend the House to answer for his presuming to misrepresent the proceedings. He did not attend, and the attorney-general was instructed
'to find out and prosecute him.'
  </p><p> In No. 18 of the Tatler, the joint production of Steele and Addison, is an excellent resume of the foregoing newspapers.
'There is another sort of gentlemen whom I am much more concerned for, and that is the ingenious fraternity of which I

<pb n="70" id="p.70"/>
 have the honour to be an unworthy member; I mean the News Writers of Great Britain, whether Post Men or Post Boys, or by what other name or title soever dignified, or distinguished. The case of these gentlemen is, I think more hard than that of the Soldiers, considering they have taken more towns, and fought more battles. They have been upon parties and skirmishes, when our armies have lain still; and given the general assault to many a place, when the besiegers were quiet in their trenches. They have made us masters of several strong towns many weeks before our generals could do it; and completed victories, when our greatest captains have been glad to come off with a drawn battle. Where Prince Eugene has slain his thousands, Boyer has slain his ten thousands. This gentleman can indeed be never enough commended for his courage and intrepidity during the whole war: he has laid about him with an inexpressible fury; and, like the offended Marius of ancient Rome, made such havoc among his countrymen, as must be the work of two or three ages to repair. It must be confessed, the redoubted Mr. Buckley has shed as much blood as the former; but I cannot forbear saying (and I hope it will not look like envy) that we regard our brother Buckley as a kind of Drawcansir, <note place="foot" n="7">The name of a principal character in the Duke of Buckingham's comedy of The Rehearsal.
 </note> who spares neither friend nor foe; but generally kills as many of his own side as the enemies. It is impossible for this ingenious sort of men to subsist after a peace; every one remembers the shifts they were driven to in the reign of King Charles the Second, when they could not furnish out a single paper of News, without lighting up a Comet in Germany, or a fire in Moscow. There scarce appeared a letter without a paragraph on an earthquake. Prodigies were grown so familiar, that they had lost their name, as a great Poet of that age has it. I remember Mr. Dyer, who is justly looked upon by all Fox hunters in the nation as the greatest statesman our country has produced, was particularly famous for dealing in whales; insomuch, that in five months' time (for I had the Curiosity to examine his letters on that occasion) he brought three into the mouth of the River Thames, besides two porpoises, and a


<pb n="71" id="p.71"/>
 Sturgeon. The judicious and wary Mr. Ichabod Dawks hath all along been the rival of this great writer, and got himself a reputation from plagues and famines; by which, in those days, he destroyed as great multitudes, as he has lately done by the sword. In every dearth of news, Grand Cairo was sure to be unpeopled.'
   </p><p> The Evening Post came out in Aug. <date value="1706">1706</date>, and was
'Published by John Morphew near Stationers' Hall.' It seems to have been then a failure, but it was started again in
<date value="1709">1709</date>. The Evening Courant, which started July <date value="1711">1711</date>, seems also to have had a very brief existence, as did also the Night Post, which was born the same year; but this latter seems to have had a longer life than its sister the Courant.
  </p><p>  The domestic news in them was nearly nil- principally of the sailing of ships or bringing in of prizes. Foreign news was taken bodily from the foreign papers, as we see in the Daily Courant, in the Appendix; and the home news was left to take care of itself. The Gazette generally had the Queen's Speech to Parliament, and sometimes the other newspapers would also have it, if on very special occasions, say on June 6, <date value="1712">1712</date>, when the Queen communicated to Parliament the terms on which a peace might be made; yet the only reference the Flying Post of June 5/7 has on the subject is, 'Yesterday Her Majesty went to the House of Peers, and made a long speech to both Houses.'
   </p><p> In fact, in all the twelve years of this reign, I only remember meeting with one long account of any piece of home news, and I cannot help thinking that was manufactured, as it is decidedly of the catchpenny and chapbook order. It was 'An

 Account of the Apprehending and Taking of Thomas Wallis, alias Whipping Tom,' a wicked villain who got hold of unprotected females, when crossing the unfrequented fields near Hackney, and administered a fearful thrashing to them,' with a great Rodd of Birch, that the Blood ran down their tender Bodies in a sad and dreadful manner.' His only excuse was his 'being resolved to be Revenged on all the Women he could come at after that manner, for the sake of one Perjur'd Female, who had been Barbarously False to him.' He 'believed that he had Whip'd from the 10th of October last to the 1st of December, about Three Score and Ten, including Widdows, Wives and Maids, and did intend, if he had not been taken, to have made them up to a Hundred betwixt this and Christmas, at which time he then intended to keep Hollyday till after Twelfday, and then began his Whipping Work.' And once, too, the Postboy (Jan. 27/29, <date value="1713">1713</date>) broke out in a sarcastically humorous vein: 'On Monday last that Facetious and Merry Gentleman in the Pulpit, Mr. Daniel Burgess, departed this Life to the great Mortification of his Female Auditors.'
  </p><p> 'Esq: Thomas Burnet (S-n of that vertuous, orthodox, pious, forgiving, impartial, sincere, never wav-ri-g (always standing to his T-x-t) modest, conscientious Di-ne, and by the Gr- of G-d in the fere of the L-d) was on Saturday last taken up, and carried to the Lord Viscount Bolinbroke's Office, for being the Author of that seditious and scandalous Pamphlet, call'd A certain Information of a certain Discourse,

 </p><p>  One would imagine that after this flagellation Roper would not be the first to assault a brother journalist, but he fell foul of Ridpath, who conducted the Flying Post, and this is how he did it: 'Yesterday, one George Ridpath, a Cameronian, who formerly (as it is credibly reported) was banished Scotland, for putting on Lawn Sleves, and administering -- to a Dog, in derision of the Church and Bishops, was committed to Newgate for several scandalous Reflections writ by him in a Paper formerly publish'd call'd the Observator; and for being the Author of several notorious Falshoods and scandalous Reflections on the Queen and Government, in a paper call'd The Flying Post.'  <note place="foot" n="10">Post Boy, Sept. 6/9, <date value="1712">1712</date>.</note>
  </p><p> Ridpath,<note place="foot" n="11"> Ridpath invented a manifold writer, which would take six or more copies at once.</note> of whom Dunton says ' His Humility and His Honesty have establish'd his Reputation,' hit back by means of an anonymous correspondent in the Flying Post:-
         </p><p>                      'Lynn Regis in Norfolk, Sep. 22.
 </p><p>  ' Sir,
 </p><p>         'Having observ'd the false Account which that Scandalous Wretch Abel Roper gave some time ago in his Post Boy, about the Reception of Mr. Walpole here; This is to inform you 'tis a notorious Lye; for that worthy Gentleman had a very honourable Reception, answerable to the just Esteem which this Corporation has for him.'
 </p><p>  A notice of one more sparring match must close this subject-the same two papers.     Says friend Abel <note place="foot" n="12">Post Boy, Mar. 3o/April 1, <date value="1714">1714</date>.</note>: 'In the Flying Post of last Tuesday, we have a very unusual Specimen of the Author's Modesty, in Owning and Recanting the Lye he had so impudently fix'd on Dr. S       1 in his

<pb n="74" id="p.74"/>
 former Paper. But 'tis very remarkable, That by endeavouring to excuse this Lye, he unluckily falls into his Habitual Sin again, no less than three times in this single Paragraph.
. . . So little Credit is to be given to this Infamous Weekly Libel, filled always with Lies of the Author's own Invention, or such as are taken up at second-hand, and vouch'd by him without the least Regard to Truth, Common Sense, or Common Honesty.'
 </p><p>   After this, who can wonder if some editors had rather a rough time of it, especially Roper. He gives us<note place="foot" n="13"> Postboy, Sept. 12/15, <date value="1713">1713</date>. </note> one glimpse of his condition: 'Last night William Thompson Esq., came to the Proprietor of this Paper, and told him, That if he did not insert the following Paragraph in his Paper of this Day, God Damn him, he would cut his Throat, and he had a Penknife in his Pocket for that purpose; for which the Proprietor of this Paper designs to prosecute him according to Law, but thought fit to publish this, that the Nation may be Judges, whether a Person of such a Character is proper to be employ'd in his Station in the Law? or, Whether our Constitution ought to be entrusted in such Hands as will not scruple to commit Murder when ever it may serve their Purpose.'
   </p><p> In <date value="1704">1704</date> the House of Commons took umbrage at some remarks which John Tutchin, the conductor of the Observator, had made on some mismanagement of public affairs (and they were undoubted libels), and cited him, the printer, and publisher before their Bar, to be brought in custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms. Tutchin gave bail for his appearance; and his trial came on on Nov. 4, <date value="1704">1704</date>. <note place="foot" n="2 ">Howell's State Trials, ed. <date value="1812">1812</date>, v. 14.
</note> He got off somehow, and was never tried again. Earlier in life he had been tried at the Bloody Assizes, where he had the brutal Jeffreys for his judge, and he was sentenced 'to be imprisoned for Seven Years; that once every year he should be whipt through all the Market Towns in Dorsetshire; that he should pay a fine of one hundred marks to the King, and find security for his good behaviour during life. . . . Upon passing the Sentence, the Clerk of the Arraigns stood up, and said, My lord, there are a great many market towns in this County; the sentence reaches to a whipping about once a fortnight, and he is a
   <pb id="p.75" n="75"/>
 very young man. Aye, says Jeffreys, he is a young man but an old rougue; and all the interest in England shall not reverse the sentence I have past upon        him.'   So poor Tutchin's heart died within him, and he petitioned the King that he 'will be mercifully pleased to grant him the favour of being hanged with those of his fellow prisoners, that are condemned to die.' But to no avail.
  </p><p>  His friends tried to buy him a pardon, but Jeffreys frustrated all their efforts. At length Tutchin fell ill of the smallpox, and nearly died of it, being only tended by his fellow-prisoners. During his illness his mother bought his pardon of Jeffreys 1; then she fell sick of the smallpox, and died.
  </p><p> Of Tutchin's trial in <date value="1704">1704</date> we have the following contemporary evidence from    Luttrell: ' 8 May.      Mr. Tutchin, author of the Observator, against whom a proclamation was out at the desire of the House of Commons, has given <date value="1000">1000</date>&#x00A3;. bail to answer what shal be objected against him'; and on May 29 he gave fresh bail. His trial began, as we know, on Nov. 4, and he was found guilty, but sentence was deferred. On the 14th we hear 'Yesterday, Mr. Tutchin, found guilty of publishing the Observator, appeared at the Queen's bench Court, when his council inform'd the Court of an error in the information, and the Attorney General desiring time to consider of it, Tutchin is to attend again on Saturday.' The point was the false dating of the wait; and he attended on the
20th and 23rd, when it was argued; and on Nov. 28 judgment was given in Tutchin's favour, 'the Attorney General at liberty to try him again,' which he never did.
  </p><p> This trial is interesting, as it furnishes us with evidence as to the pay of an editor, or rather author (for Tutchin wrote the whole paper), of that time. John How was the proprietor of the paper, which appeared first on April 1, <date value="1702">1702</date>. In his evidence is the following:-
  </p><p>  A scandalous practice then in vogue. 'Mr. Tutchin hereupon endeavoured to get a pardon from the people who had grants of lives, many of them 500, some
<date value="1000">1000</date>, more or less as they had interest with the King.' Again: 'For it was usual at that time for one Courtier to get a pardon of the King for half a Score, and then by the assistance of Jeffreys to augment the sum to fourscore or a hundred.' In these 'Bloody Assizes' 300 persons were condemned to death, and nearly <date value="1000">1000</date> sold as slaves to the West Indian plantations.

  </p><p> At the same time there were other libels afloat. ' 30 May
<date value="1704">1704</date>. Yesterday came out a proclamation by her Majestie for discovering and apprehending the author, printer, and publisher of a scandalous libel, intituled, Legions Humble Addresse to the Lords; offering the reward of &#x00A3; 100 for the author thereof, and fifty pounds for the printer thereof.' <note place="foot" n="16"> Luttrell. </note>
 </p><p>  Was not Steele turned out of Parliament for libel ? Resolved that Richard Steele, Esquire, for his offence in writing and publishing the said scandalous and seditious libels, be expelled the House;'<note place="foot" n="17">Journals of the House of Commons, vol. xvii. p. 514.</note> and the resolution was adopted by
245 votes against 152.
  </p><p> In <date value="1709">1709</date> Luttrell tells us: '15 Oct. The Authors of the Review and Female Tatler were presented by the grand jury as scandalous and a publick nuisance, and were ordered to be prosecuted. 1 Nov. This day the printer and publisher of the New Atlantis were examined touching the author Mrs. Manley; they were discharged, but she remains in custody.
5 Nov. One Ball is taken up for writing scandalous papers on persons of quality; but Mrs. Manley, the author of the New Atlantis, is admitted to Bayl.'
 </p><p>   Few would be inclined to pity the profligate Mrs. Manley for any punishment she might have received for her scandalous libels in both the Female Tatler and the New Atlantis;


<pb n="77" id="p.77"/>
 but she was not punished. On the contrary, the ministry gave her employment for her pen.
  </p><p> The Tatler commenced the series of Essay papers. Steele is almost apologetic, in its first number, for having to make any charge. He elaborately calls attention to the expenses incurred in getting up such a paper, and adds 'these considerations will I hope make all persons willing to comply with my humble request (when my gratis stock is exhausted) of a penny a piece.' And an advertisement at the end of No. 4 says, 'Upon the humble petition of Running Stationers
&#x0026;c., this Paper may be had of them, for the future, at the price of one penny.' But there was a more expensive edition, whole-sheet Tatlers, having a double quantity of paper, with one half-sheet blank 'to write business on, and for the convenience of the post,' and they, of course, were more expensive. The Tatler, Spectator, and Guardian were all of Steele's creation ; they were born, and died, at his discretion; and the Spectator, at least, was always laid on the Royal breakfast table. Their imitators were numerous, but shortlived; in fact, the imposition of a halfpenny stamp massacred the innocents of the press in a wholesale manner.
 </p><p>  This tax was evidently in contemplation some time before it became law.    Swift writes to Stella, Jan. 31, <date value="1711">1711</date>: 'They are here intending to tax all little printed penny papers a halfpenny every half sheet, which will utterly ruin Grub Street, and I am endeavouring to prevent it.' It slept for a little, but it was smuggled at last into the 10th Anne,1<note place="foot" n="18">The part of this Act specially bearing upon newspapers was a stamp duty for thirty-two years from August 1, <date value="1712">1712</date> : 'And be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, that there shall be Raised, Levied, Collected and Paid, to and for the Use of her Majesty, her Heirs and Successors, for and upon all Books or Papers Commonly called Pamphlets, and for and upon all News Papers, or Papers containing Publick News, Intelligence or Occurrences, which shall, at any time or times within or during the Term last mentioned, be Printed in Great Britain to be Dispersed and made Publick, and for and upon such Advertisements as are herein after mentioned the respective Duties following; That is to say,
   ' For every such Pamphlet or Paper contained in Half a Sheet or any lesser Piece of Paper, so Printed, the sum of One half penny.
   ' For every such Pamphlet or Paper (being larger than Half a Sheet, not exceeding one Whole Sheet) so Printed, a Duty after the Rate of One Peny Sterling for every Printed Copy thereof.
   'And for every such Pamphlet or Paper, being larger than One Whole Sheet, and not exceeding Six Sheets in Octavo, or in a Lesser Page, or not exceeding Twelve Sheets in Quarto, or Twenty Sheets in Folio, so Printed, a Duty after the Rate of Two Shillings Sterling for every Sheet of any kind of Paper which shall be Contained in One Printed Copy thereof.
  ' And for every Advertisement to be Contained in the London Gazette or any other printed Paper, such Paper being Dispersed or made publick Weekly, or oftner, the Sum of Twelve Pen e Sterling.' Acts of Parliament were exempt.</note> cap. 19,


<pb n="78" id="p.78"/>
 and fairly hidden among duties on soap, paper, silk, linens, hackney chairs, cards, marriage licences, etc. It came into operation on Aug. 1, <date value="1712">1712</date>, and Swift makes merry over the effect it will have on the struggling periodical literature.
'19 July <date value="1712">1712</date>. Grub Street has but ten days to live; then an act of parliament takes place that ruins it, by taxing every half sheet at a halfpenny.' '17 Aug. <date value="1712">1712</date>. Do you know that Grub Street is dead and gone last week? No more ghosts or murders now for love or money. I plied it pretty close the last fortnight, and published at least seven penny papers of my own, besides some of other people's: but now every single half sheet pays a halfpenny to the Queen. The Observator is fallen; the Medleys are jumbled together with the Flying Post; the Examiner is deadly sick; the Spectator keeps up, and doubles its price; I know not how long it
                will hold. Have you seen the red stamp
                the papers are marked with?    Methinks the
                stamping is worth a halfpenny.'
                  </p><p> The Spectator does not chuckle over the
                fall of its humbler brethren. Addison says1:
                'This is the Day on which many eminent
                Authors will probably Publish their Last
                Words. I am afraid that few of our Weekly
                Historians, who are Men that above others
                delight in War, will be able to subsist under the Weight of a Stamp, and an approaching Peace. A Sheet of Blank Paper that must have this new Imprimatur clapt upon it, before it is qualified to Communicate any thing to the Publick, will make its Way in the World but very heavily. In short, the Necessity of carrying a Stamp, and the Improbability of Notifying a Bloody Battel, will, I am afraid, both concur to the sinking of those thin Folios, which have every other Day retailed to us the History of Europe for several Years last past. A Facetious Friend of mine who

 loves a Punn, calls this present Mortality among Authors, The Fall of the Leaf.'
  </p><p> All the papers, except the Spectator, rose their price just the value of the stamps; but that 'Society Journal' charged
1d. extra-a fact which caused no little grumbling-and which made Addison put forth all his powers of special pleading to vindicate (see No. 488).
  </p><p> The imposition of 1s. duty on advertisements had no deterrent effect upon them; this 'backbone of the paper' continued as before. There is nothing that I have found to guide us as to the prices of advertisements, except in one case-and I hardly think that can be called a representative one. It is that of a short-lived paper called 'THE GENE- ROUS ADVERTISER OR Weekly Information of TRADE and BUSINESS. To be published every Tuesday, and Friday, and <date value="4000">4000</date> of them always carefully Distributed and Given away Gratis each Day, in and about the City's of London and Westminster.' It enjoyed its brief existence in
<date value="1707">1707</date>. The terms were not excessive under the circumstances:
'Advertisements . . . will be taken by the Men who carry this PAPER about; Who will take them in very Carefully and Cheap viz. after the Rate of 3d. for every Fifty letters.'
  </p><p> Advertisements, with the exception of those of quack doctors and their medicines, were very much as now. Booksellers, public amusements, things lost, things for sale, etc., give those old sheets a strange similarity to those we are so familiar with.
  </p><p> Even the poor almanacs were taxed. The Protestant Post Boy, Nov. 15/17, <date value="1711">1711</date>, says, 'Whereas, by an Act made last Sessions of Parliament, a Duty was laid on all Almanacks, and a Penalty of Ten Pounds is for any one that shall Sell any Almanacks without being first Stampt as the Law directs; and whereas the said Tax &#x0026;c. has made a great Attraction in the Price, this is to give Notice to all Retale Buyers, or others that the Prices are as follows.
  </p><p> 'An Almanack Bound in Red Leather, with Paper to Write on, of any Sort. Ninepence.
  </p><p> 'An Almanack of any Sort Sticht. Six Pence.
  </p><p> 'Any Sheet Almanack Four Pence.'

<pb n="80" id="p.80"/>

 </p><p>  It is hardly worth while to give an exhaustive list of the almanacs then in vogue. One advertisement<note place="foot" n="20"> Daily Courant, Nov. 10, <date value="1705">1705</date>.</note> will be ample for the purpose: 'On Thursday next (15 Nov.) will be published the following Almanacks for the Year <date value="1706">1706</date>. viz. Andrews, Chapman, Coley, Dove, Gadbury, Ladies Diary, Moor, Partridge, Pond, Poor Robin, Salmon, Saunders, Tanner, Wing, Colepepper, Dade, Fly, Fowl, Perkins, Rose, Swallow, Trigge, Turner, White, Woodhouse.'
  </p><p> Out of which, that by Francis Moore, physician, the 'Vox Stellarum,' is still published. Doubts have been thrown on the reality of this gentleman, but it is certain that he did live, and Lysons speaks of him as having lived in Calcotts Alley, High Street (then called Back Lane), Lambeth, where he practised the combined professions of astrologer, physician, and schoolmaster. He also lived in Southwark and in Westminster. There is an engraving of him extant, evidently done in Queen Anne's reign, by Drapentier, who also engraved the portrait of Dr. Burgess. Moore is represented as a fat-faced man in a full-bottomed wig. The legend is 'Francis Moore, born in Bridgenorth, in the County of Salop, the 29th of January <date value="1656">1656</date>/7.' His almanac was first published in
<date value="1698">1698</date>.

</p><p>   Besides these, there was plenty of proverbial philosophy, interspersed with divers merry tales, and eccentric receipts, the whole going to form a compilation perfectly unique for its time.
</p><p>   Perhaps the chief among the serious astrological, and predicting, almanacs was 'Merlinus Liberatus, by JOHN PAR- TRIDGE, Student in Physick and Astrology, at the Blue Ball in Salisbury Street, in the Strand, London.' Not, perhaps, that he would have lived in story, much more than his fellows, had it not have been for the fun that Swift, Steele,

<pb n="83" id="p.83"/>
 and Addison made of him. Swift set the ball rolling, in his sham  'Predictions for the year <date value="1708">1708</date>, by Isaac Bickerstaff'
(his pseudonym), in which he says: 'My first prediction is but a trifle, yet I will mention it to show how ignorant those sottish pretenders to astronomy are in their own concerns. It relates to Partridge the Almanack maker. I have consulted the star of his nativity by my own rules, and find he will infallibly die on the 29th of March next, about eleven at night, of a raging fever; therefore, I advise him to consider of it, and settle his affairs in time.' This was a happy thought, born of the fact that Partridge had prophesied the downfall and death of Louis XIV. Early in April I708 Swift published 'The accomplishment of the first part of Mr. Bickerstaff's predictions, being an account of the death of Mr. Partridge, the Almanac maker, on the 29th of March,
<date value="1708">1708</date>, in a letter to a person of honour.'
  </p><p> From that moment Partridge was dead. It was no use his publicly stating that he was alive. The wits had decreed his fate, and dead he was. His elegy and epitaph were printed, in the grisly manner common to those productions. They are too long for reproduction, but are too good not to quote from.</p><p>

</p><p>   Congreve, or Rowe, took up cudgels for the poor man, and wrote and published 'Squire Bickerstaff detected, or the astrological impostor convicted, by JOHN PARTRIDGE, student in Physick, and Astrology.' What was the use ? Not only were the above squibs being sold about the streets for a halfpenny, but Swift had to annihilate his opponents by his 'Vindication of Isaac Bickerstaff Esq. against what is objected to him by Mr. Partridge, in his Almanack for the present year, <date value="1709">1709</date>.'
  </p><p> Steele, even in the very first Tatler, could not forbear poking fun at Partridge. 'I have, in another place, and in a paper by itself, sufficiently convinced this man that he is
 <pb id="p.85" n="85"/>
 dead, and, if he has any shame, I do not doubt but that by this time he owns it to all his acquaintance; for though the legs and arms and whole body of that man may still appear, and perform their animal functions; yet since, as I have elsewhere observed, his art is gone, the man is gone.' And so the banter was kept up, at intervals, all through the Tatler.
</p><p>   As an almanac writer he, in fact, did die in <date value="1709">1709</date>, for that was the last he really published-although an almanac is still sold bearing the same title. He really, and corporeally, died in <date value="1715">1715</date>, and was buried in Mortlake Churchyard, where, on a flat black marble stone, was the following inscription:-

<p> PEOPLE got ill then as now, and, judging by the following list, there were just about as many diseases, only scientific names had not taken the place of the old homely nomenclature. This is taken from a list of deaths from all causes:
'Age. Ague and Fever, Appoplex and Suddenly, Bleach, Blasted, Bloody Flux, Scouring and Flux. Burns and Scalds. Bleeding, Calenture, Cancer, Gangrene and Fistula, Wolf, Canker, Soremouth and Thrush, Colick and Wind, Cough and Cold, Consumption and Cough, Convulsion, Cramp, Dropsie and Tympany, Excessive drinking, Falling Sickness, Flox and Small Pox, French pox, Gout, Grief, Head Ach, Jaundice, Jaw-faln, Impostume, Itch, King's Evil, Lethargy, Leprosie, Liver-grown, Spleen and Rickets, Lunatick, Meagrom, Measles, Mother, Palsie, Plague, Plague in the Guts, Pleurisie, Purples and Spotted Fever, Quinsie and Sore Throat, Rising of the Lights, Rupture, Scal'd head, Scurvy, Sores and Ulcers, Spleen, Shingles, Stitch, Stone and Strangury, Sciatica, Stopping of the Stomach, Surfet. Swine Pox. Teeth and Worms, Tissick, Vomiting, Wen.'
 </p><p> Of these, the most deaths resulted from consumption and cough, next ague and fever, then flox and smallpox. The infant mortality was terrible-the great cause of death
<pb n="88" id="p.88"/>
 being put down as teeth and worms. Consumption even now baffles the skill of our physicians. Quinine was then used for ague and fever, not as the crystal alkaloid, but in the rough bark, which was sold as 'Jesuits Bark,' at prices ranging from 4s. to 10s. per lb. Smallpox, inoculation or vaccination being unknown, was a fearful scourge, and spared no one-helped, as it was, by the all but utter ignorance of sanitary science, to the value of which we, in this generation, are only awaking.
 </p><p>Quackery was rampant, probably because people did not have much belief in the healing powers of the regular practitioners. Herbs and simples were much in use; and not only were there fearful remedies concocted by fair hands in the still-room, but naturally every old woman had faith in the traditional medicaments handed down to her by her forefathers. Also the empiricism of the alchemists still lingered
-see the following advertisement: 'Whereas the Viper hath been a Medicine approv'd by the Physicians of all Nations; there is now prepar'd the Volatile Spirit compound of it, a Preparation altogether new, not only exceeding all Volatiles and Cordials whatsoever, but all the Preparations of the Viper itself, being the Receipt of a late Eminent Physician, and prepar'd only by a Relation. It is the most Sovereign Remedy against all Faintings, Sweatings, Lowness of Spirits, Vapours &#x0026;c.-As also in all Habits of Body or Disorders proceeding from Intemperance, eating of Fruit, drinking of bad Wine, or any other poysonous or crude Liquors, and is good to take off the ill Effects or Remains of the Bark or Jesuits Powder.'
  </p><p> Bleeding and purging-these were the main remedies relied on in those old days; something to make the patient remember his illness by, as he did his doctor's bill, by the quantity of medicine he had swallowed. Brown, satirist as he was, was truthful, even to coarseness, and neither he nor Ward told lies in order to round a sentence, or point an epigram. This is how Brown <note place="foot" n="1">The Dispensary, by Thos. Brown.</note>makes a fashionable physician describe his practice: 'He pays well, and takes Physick freely: besides I particularly know his Constitution; after


<pb n="89" id="p.89"/>
 Bleeding, he must take a Purge or two, then some Cordial Powders, Dulcifiers of the Blood, and two or three odd things more. ... I tell you 'tis an easie thing for a Man of Parts to be a Surgeon; do but buy a Lancet, Forceps, Saw; talk a little of Contusions, Fractures, Compress and Bandage; you'll presently by most People, be thought an excellent Surgeon.
. . I myself have turn'd out several Doctors out of Families because they would not prescribe Physick plentifully, and in large Quantities. I have perswaded my Patients, that they did not well understand their Distemper; so have brought in another who has swingingly dos'd 'um. I could tell you of a Sir Harry that paid an &#x00A3; 100 for Physick in six Weeks, and I accepted it, being a Friend, without requiring one Penny for my own Fees.'
  </p><p> The profession then, as now, was divided among Physicians, Surgeons, and Apothecaries; and the relative position of two of them is mentioned by Addison1<note place="foot" n="2">Spectator, No. 16.</note>: 'An Operator of this Nature might act under me with the same regard as a Surgeon to a Physician; the one might be employ'd in healing those Blotches and Tumours which break out in the Body, while the other is sweetning the Blood and rectifying the Constitution.' The Apothecaries, of course, kept shops for the supply of drugs.
   </p><p>In the great fire of <date value="1666">1666</date> the College of Physicians, which was at Amen Corner, was burnt down, and a new one built, which was used till <date value="1825">1825</date>, in Warwick Lane:-

 </p><p>  Ward  <note place="foot" n="3">London Spy.</note> sums up the physician's privileges: 'What Priviledges, said I, extraordinary are Granted to them in their Charter, above what are held by other Physicians who are not of their Society? Many, replied my friend, and these in particular, viz. No Person, tho' a Graduate in Physick of Oxford or Cambridge, and a Man of more Learning, Judgment and Experience than one half of their Members, shall have the Liberty of practising in, or within Seven Miles of London, without License under the Colledge Seal; Or in any other part of England, if they have not taken some Degree at one of the Universities; They have also power to administer an Oath, which they know by Experience is as practicable to be broke the next Day, as 'tis to be taken; They can likewise Fine and Imprison Offenders, in the Science of Physick, and all such who presume to Cure a Patient, when they have given 'em over, by more excellent Measures than ever were known by their Ignorance; They have also the Priviledge of making By Laws, for the Interest of themselves, and Injury of the Publick, and can purchase Lands in Right of the Corporation, if they could but find Money to pay for 'em; they have authority to examine the Medicines in all Apothecaries Shops, to Judge of the wholesomeness and Goodness of many Drugs and Compositions they never yet understood; They are likewise exempt from troublesome Offices, as Jury men, Constables, &#x0026;c.'
 </p><p>  A visiting physician's fee was a guinea, but a consulting one's less. ' The Worshipful Graduate in the noble Art of Man slaughter, receiv'd us with a Civility that was peculiar to him at the sight of four Half Crowns.' A suit of black
(velvet if possible), a full-bottomed wig, a muff, and a goldor silver-headed cane formed the outward adornment of the physician.

 </p><p>  The surgeons, not being incorporated till <date value="1800">1800</date>, had no special meeting-place; but the apothecaries had their Hall in Water Lane, Blackfriars, which had been built in <date value="1670">1670</date>, and is thus described by Garth:-
        <quote rend="blockquote">  <l>Nigh where Fleet Ditch descends in sable Streams,</l>
          <l>To wash his sooty Naiads in the Thames;</l>
         <l> There stands a Structure on a Rising Hill,</l>
         <l> Where Tyro's take their Freedom out to kill.</l>
                          <l>  -The Dispensary, Canto 3, ed. <date value="1699">1699</date>.</l></quote>

   </p><p> Professional etiquette was, as a rule, strictly adhered to, and these divisions did not interfere with each other, although Brown  <note place="foot" n="4">The Dispensary</note> intimates that it was done occasionally: ' Gallypot....
" For tho' I am an Old Apothecary, I am but a Young Doctor. For I visit in either Capacity, either as an Old Apothecary, which is as good as a Young Doctor, or as a Young Doctor, and that's as good as t'other again."  Trueman. "But I thought you had left off Shop, and stuck only to your Doctorship ?"  Gallypot. " So I do openly, but privately I keep a Shop, and side in all things with the Apothecaries against the Doctors."'
  </p><p> This allusion refers to a curious dissension which had arisen in the profession. The physicians at the latter end of the seventeenth century were undoubtedly an ignorant and unscientific race; and the apothecaries, finding that if they did not know as much, they could soon do so, began to prescribe on their own responsibility, as Pope  <note place="foot" n="5">Essay on Criticism.</note> says:-

          <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>So modern 'pothecaries taught the art</l>
           <l>By Doctor's bills, to play the Doctor's part;</l>
           <l>Bold in the practice of mistaken rules,</l>
           <l>Prescribe, apply, and call their Masters fools.</l></quote>

   </p><p>The physicians naturally resented this, and, making a pretext that the apothecary's charges were so enormous as to render their prescriptions useless to the poor, they eventually set up a Dispensary of their own at the College, where they sold medicines to the poor at cost price. And this accusation was warranted, if we can believe Brown. 'Pray how do ye at your end of the Town prize a Dose of common Purging

<pb n="92" id="p.92"/>
 Pills?'  'Why, Brother, about Eighteenpence, sometimes Two Shillings, with an Haustus after them of Three and Sixpence.' 'And can you live so ? I believe all the things cost you at least a Shilling out of Pocket.' 'No, God forbid! How could I live then? Indeed they cost, me about Sixpence, and I take but Five Shillings and Sixpence, sometimes less, and I think that's honest Gains.'
  </p><p> This Dispensary was the cause of great disturbance, and split the profession into Dispensarians and anti-Dispensarians, and a naturally acrimonious feeling sprang up, which was only allayed by the obnoxious Dispensary being given up, when things fell back into their old groove.
 </p><p>  The Pharmacopoeias then in use were 'Lasher's,' Bate's Dispensary,' 'Hartman's Family Physitian,' and ' Salmon's Collectanea Medica' 1; and very curious indeed were some of the medicines prescribed, as ' Live Hog Lice,' 'Burnt Cork quenched in Aqua Vitae,' 'Red Coral,' New Gathered Earth Worms,' 'Live Toads,'' Black tips of Crabs Claws,' ' Man's Skull,' 'Elk's hoofs,' Leaves of Gold,' 'Man's bones calcined,'
'Inward skin of a Capon's Gizzard,' 'Goose dung, gather'd in the Spring time, dry'd in the Sun,' 'Stone of a Carp's head,'
'Unicorn's horn,' Boar's tooth,' 'Jaw of a Pike,' 'Wind pipes of Sheep cleansed and dryed in an Oven, Wind pipes of Capons in like manner prepared,' 'Sea Horse tooth rasped,'
'Frog's livers,' 'White dung of a Peacock dryed,'' Toads and Vipers flesh,' Cuttle fish bone,' and many others even more repulsive than these.

  </p><p> All remedies, however, were not of the foregoing descrip-

 tion, and many receipts seem admirably fitted to effect their desired purpose, the great fault with them being that they were overloaded with extraneous compounds, which could not possibly do the patient any good, and must necessarily add greatly to the cost, if only the extra time taken in their preparation be counted. Bleeding and purging, as before said, were the remedies really relied on, and bleeding took place on the slightest occasion. Not only the lancet, but cupping, was employed; indeed, cuppers attended nearly every Bagnio or bath, as Ward says: 'I'll carry you to see the Hummuns, where I have an honest old Acquaintance that is a Cupper.' He describes the operation thus: 'By the Perswasions of my Friend, and my Friend's Friend, I at last consented; upon which the Operator fetch'd in his Instruments, and fixes three Glasses at my Back, which by drawing out the Air, stuck to me as close as a Cantharides Plaister to the Head of a Lunatick, and Sucked as hard as so many Leeches, till I thought they would have crept into me, and have come out on t'other side. When by Virtue of this Hocus Pocus Stratagem, he had conjur'd all the ill blood out of my Body, under his glass Juggling Cups, he plucks out an ill favour'd Instrument, at which I was as much frighted, as an absconding Debtor is at the sight of a Bill of Middlesex, takes off his Glasses, which had made my Shoulders as weary as a Porter's Back under a heavy Burthen, and begins to Scarifie my Skin, as a Cook does a Loin of Pork to be Roasted; but with such Ease and Dexterity, that I could have suffer'd him to have Pink'd me all over as full of Eyelet holes, as the Taylor did the Shoemakers Cloak, had any Malady requir'd it, without Flinching; when he had drawn away as much Blood as he thought Necessary, for the removal of my pain, he cover'd the Places he had Carbonaded, with a new Skin, provided for that purpose, and heal'd the Scarifications he had made, in an Instant.'
    </p><p>'A Cantharides Plaister to the Head of a Lunatick' shows us somewhat how those poor unfortunates who were bereft of their senses were treated. Of Bethlehem Hospital I will speak in another place, regarding it more as a prison for the safe keeping of mad people than as an hospital,where, by any
                                      <pb id="p.95" n="95"/>
 means, those cloudy intellects could be brightened up and cleared.
  </p><p> If the relatives or friends could afford it, they were put under the charge of some one, as now, who would pretend to try and cure them; but then, unlike the present time, there was not even the form of a visitation to hear complaints, or to report on ill-treatment. 'At the Pestle and Mortar on Snow Hill, is a Person who has had great Experience and success in curing Lunaticks, he has also conveniences for Persons of both Sexes, good and diligent Attendance for the best ranks of People, and having for several years past,perform'd it to the satisfaction of many Families: He therefore makes this Publick, to inform, where on very reasonable rates the same Cure shall be industriously endeavour'd, and (with God's Blessing) effected.' Does it not look like a model for a modern advertisement ? How Dr. So and So, assisted by a large staff of well-trained domestics, etc.
  </p><p> Here is an advertisement of a private Mad House. It being industriously given out by some malicious Persons, That the House of the Late Claudius Gillat at Hoxton, for the Accommodation of 'Lunaticks, is shut up; These are to Certify, that the said House is still kept by William Prowting, Apothecary, who has all Conveniences fitting for such persons; as a large House, pleasant Gardens, &#x0026;c., and gives Liberty to any Physician, Surgeon or Apothecary, of administering Physick to those that are recommended by them.'
  </p><p>  Another Advertisement, however, lets a little light into the treatment of the mentally afflicted: 'A Dumb young Man broke his Chain last Wednesday Night, and left his Friends from their House in Compton Street, next door to the Golden Ball Alehouse, Soho, and those that will take Care to bring him Home, shall be Rewarded. He has been Mad these 23 Years.'
  </p><p> Garth thus describes a prosperous physician:-

    </p><p>Like his descendant of modern times, who cannot possibly be clever in his profession unless he drives two horses to his brougham, the physician of Queen Anne's reign had to have his coach; but then it must have at least four horses-of course he must be vastly cleverer if he could drive six-but still, his equipage must be well appointed, and in the fashion. Of course he need not go to the extent Radcliffe did; but Radcliffe made himself the laughing-stock of the town, both by the gaiety of his turn-out and by a rumour getting abroad that he had started it with the idea of favourably impressing a young and wealthy lady, to whom this old Adonis of sixty would needs pay his addresses-in which scheme, alas for the doctor! he was not successful. Steele could not resist having a bit of fun over it. ' This day, passing through Covent garden, I was stopped in the piazza by PACOLET, to observe what he called the Triumph of LOVE and YOUTH. I turned to the object he pointed at, and there I saw a gay gilt Chariot, drawn by fresh prancing horses; the Coachman with a new Cockade, and the lacqueys with insolence and plenty in their countenances. I asked immediately, "What young heir or lover owned that glittering equipage ?" But my companion interrupted: "Do you not see there the mourning AEsculapius ?" " The mourning ?" said I. "Yes Isaac," said Pacolet, "he's in deep mourning, and is the languishing, hopeless lover of the divine HEBE, <note place="foot" n="6">Miss Tempest, one of Queen Anne's Maids of Honour.</note> the emblem of youth and beauty.'  <note place="foot" n="7">The Tatler, No. 44.</note>
 </p> <p>His rival Hannes set up a beautiful carriage, etc., and it excited universal attention.  Some friend told him that Hannes' horses were the finest he had seen. 'Ah,' snarled old Radcliffe, 'then he'll be able to sell 'em for all the more.'
</p><p>  The principal physicians of Anne's reign were Dr. Radcliffe, Sir Samuel Garth, Sir Hans Sloane, and Dr. Mead.
</p>   <p>The first was born in <date value="1650">1650</date>, took his M.D. degree in <date value="1682">1682</date>, came to London in <date value="1684">1684</date>, and, somehow, at once got into good practice. He was called in to the poor little Duke of Gloucester, when too late to be of any service, and consoled



<pb n="97" id="p.97"/>
 himself by soundly rating the two physicians, Sir E. Hannes and Sir Rd. Blackmore, for their previous conduct of the case. But he was not the court physician, for which he had himself to thank. The Queen, when the Princess Anne, got somewhat hypochondriac, after the death of her sister Queen Mary, and sent for Radcliffe to come at once to see her. He was at a tavern in St. James's, enjoying his bottle. He knew there was nothing the matter, and physicians were not so smoothtongued as they are now; so he very rudely refused to go, and sent back a message that it was all fancy, and that her Royal Highness was as well as anyone else. Next morning he presented himself at the palace, only to be informed that he had been dismissed, and that Dr. Gibbons had already received his appointment. The Queen would never forgive him; but, on her death-bed, he was sent for to attend her, when he returned as answer that 'he had taken physic and could not come.' The Queen died, and great was the popular wrath against the doctor for his refusal. He might have saved her life, said the people; and after the manner of their kind, they sent him threatening letters; nay, a friend of his moved that he might be summoned to attend in his place in Parliament (he was member for the town of Buckingham) in order to be censured for not attending her Majesty. He did not long survive her, dying on Nov. I,

</p><p>  One anecdote told of him is too good not to be repeated. He would never even pay a tradesman without squabbling over the account. A paviour had been repairing the pavement in front of his house, and when he applied for his money was told he had spoiled it, and then covered it with earth to hide his bad work. 'Doctor,' replied the man, 'mine is not the only bad work the earth hides.'
</p><p>  Sir Samuel Garth took his degree of M.D. in <date value="1691">1691</date>, was elected a Fellow of the College in <date value="1692">1692</date>, and took a prominent part in the famous dispute as to the Dispensarywriting in <date value="1699">1699</date> his poem of that name, which had at once a large sale.

 his Grave, without those Funeral Obsequies suitable to his Greatness, had it not been for that true British Worthy, who, Meeting with the Venerable Remains of the neglected Bard passing silently in a Coach, unregarded to his last Home, ordered the Corps, by the consent of his few Friends that Attended him, to be Respited from so obscure an Interment; and most Generously undertook at his own Expence, to revive his Worth in the Minds of a forgetful People, by bestowing on his peaceful Dust a Solemn Funeral Answerable to his Merit.' He had the body removed to the College of Physicians, where it lay in state previous to its removal, with great pomp, to Westminster Abbey.
</p><p>   He was a member of the Kit Cat Club, and the story is told of him that one day at a meeting of that club he sat so long over his wine that Steele reminded him of his duty to his patients. Garth replied that 'it was no matter whether he saw them that night or next morning, for nine had such bad constitutions that no physician could save them, and the other six had such good ones that all the physicians in the world could not kill them.' He died Jan. 8, <date value="1719">1719</date>.
</p><p>  The name of Sir Hans Sloane is undoubtedly the most familiar to the ears of this generation of all the doctors of that time; especially to Londoners, Sloane Street and Square, and Hans Place, being all reminiscences of him, through the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth with the second Baron Cadogan.
</p><p>  He was of Scotch extraction, but born in Ireland, in <date value="1660">1660</date>. Already a Fellow of the College of Physicians and Royal Society, he accompanied as physician the Duke of Albemarle
(who had been appointed Governor of the West Indies) to Jamaica. The Duke soon died out there, and Sloane returned to England with a large collection of the flora and fauna of the countries he had visited. To this voyage may be attributed the foundation of the British Museum, for it gave him the taste for collecting rarities of every description, and, to prevent his museum from being dispersed after his death, he bequeathed it to the nation, on condition of the payment of
20,000&#x00A3;. to his family. Montague House was purchased to contain the curiosities; and from this small beginning has

<pb n="99" id="p.99"/>
 arisen that marvellous national collection, the finest in the world. Honours flowed in upon him, and, after a very busy life, he died at a good old age in <date value="1752">1752</date>.
</p><p>  Dr. Rd. Mead was born in <date value="1673">1673</date>. Clever in his profession, and the author of many medical treatises, undoubtedly he owed much of his position to Radcliffe, whose patronage he secured by the most unblushing adulation. He took advantage of every opportunity, such as moving into the larger house of a physician recently dead; and should have amassed a large fortune, as for many years he was earning between
5,000&#x00A3;. and 6,000&#x00A3;. per annum. Although his consulting fee was one guinea and his visiting fee two, he would attend either Batson's, or Tom's, Coffee Houses (the former being a noted place of resort for medical men), and thither would come the apothecaries, for whom he would write prescriptions, without seeing the patient, at half a guinea each. He is remarkable as the doctor who fought a duel. It was with Woodward, who had not only attacked him in his 'State of Physick and Diseases,' but insulted him in public. Matters came to a climax one day when they were leaving Gresham College, and, under the arch leading from the outer to the Green court, Mead's patience gave way. He drew, and called upon Woodward to defend himself or beg his pardon. Whether they ever actually fought or not is not known, although there is a bon-mot about Mead disarming Woodward and telling him to beg for his life. ' Never till I am your patient,' was his reply. Certain it is that Woodward gave in, and Mead lived in peace.
</p><p>  Mead was called in consultation when the Queen was in her last illness, and he plainly gave his opinion that she would not survive, but he did not attend her. He died Feb. 16,
<date value="1754">1754</date>, and was buried in the Temple Church.
</p><p>  There must have been some hot blood in the profession in those days, for Luttrell says: '6 July, <date value="1704">1704</date>. Mr. Coatsworth, an apothecary in St. Martin's Lane, convicted in Easter term, upon an information in the Queen's bench, for assaulting Dr. Ratcliffe, at Tom's Coffee House, by spitting in his face, upon some words that arose betwen them, was upon Monday fined
100 marks, which he paid into Court.'

<pb n="100" id="p.100"/>

</p><p>  The practice of surgery was attended with some difficulties, for there were no public schools of anatomy as now: nay, it was as late as <date value="1667">1667</date> that Evelyn presented to the Royal Society, as a wonderful curiosity, the Table of Veins, Arteries, and Nerves which he had caused to be made in Italy.
</p><p>   We see that anatomy had to be taught privately, but still that there were professors who were capable of teaching.
' On Monday the 13th Instant, Mr. Rolfe Surgeon in Chancery Lane intends to begin at his House a compleat Course of Anatomy on Human Bodies, viz. Osteology, Myology, and Enterology, to be continued every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.'  The knife was freely used, and the instruments were far from clumsy; but conservative surgery was also practised, and many orthopaedic mechanical appliances were in use. 'Charles Roberts, who makes Steel Stays, Strait Stockings, Steel Boots, Collars, Cheiques and Swings, and by many years practice, having brought the same to great perfection, is perswaded to give this publick notice for the benefit of such who suffer by Deformity.'
</p><p>   The barbers also bled and drew teeth, as many now do.
</p><p>   The oculists of that day were particularly pushing, and puffed and lied themselves into notoriety with vigour. Chief of them was Sir William Read, oculist to her most gracious majesty; and if anybody wishes to see how much that tender organ the eye can be abused by an oculist, let him read his
' Short but Exact Account of all the Diseases Incident to the Eyes.' Originally a tailor in a small way of business, he managed, somehow, to rise so as to become the Queen's sworn oculist, and to be knighted; nor only so, but was able to keep up a good establishment and a magnificent equipage. One thing is certain-he thoroughly knew the value of advertising; and the accompanying illustration is taken from one of his handbills, probably about <date value="1696">1696</date>. In it he gives a list of wonderful cures he has wrought, how he has cured wry necks, harelips, cut out cancers, trepanned skulls, operated on wens and polypuses, cured dropsy, cut off a man's leg, and given sight to numerous people who were born blind.
</p>  <p> His knighthood is thus recorded in the Gazette of July 30/Aug. 1, <date value="1705">1705</date>: 'Windsor 27 July. Her Majesty was
                            <pb n="101" id="p.101"/>
 this day Graciously pleased to confer the Honour of Knighthood upon William Read Esq. Her Majesty's Oculist in Ordinary, as a Mark of her Royal Favour for his great Services done in Curing great Numbers of Seamen and Soldiers of Blindness gratis.' This he advertised to do all
<figure id="fig.00007" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.006.DO01.00007"><head>Sir William Read Operating</head> </figure>
 through the war; and when the Palatines came over here he publicly offered to attend any of them for diseases of the eye gratis. And now, forsooth, he advertised that 'Lady Read' would attend to patients as well; and some Grub Street poet wrote a poem, called 'The Oculist,' 'Address'd to Sir William

<pb n="102" id="p.102"/>
 Read, Knt.,' with a long and fulsome dedication. One part of the poem runs:-
  <quote rend="blockquote">  <l> Whilst Britain's Sovereign Scales such WORTH has weig'd,</l>
   <l>  And ANNE her self her smiling Favours paid:</l>
   <l>  That Sacred Hand does Your fair Chaplet twist,</l>
    <l> Great READ her own Entitled OCULIST.</l>

   <l>  When the Great ANNE'S warm Smiles this Favourite raise,</l>
   <l>  'Tis not a Royal Grace she gives, but pays.</l></quote>
 Swift  <note place="foot" n="8">Journal, April 11, <date value="1711">1711</date>.
</note> writes to Stella of Read's sumptuous way of living:
'Henley would fain engage me to go with Steele and Rowe
&#x0026;c. to an invitation at Sir William Read's. Surely you have heard of him. He has been a Mountebank, and is the Queen's Oculist; he makes admirable punch, and treats you in gold vessels. But I am engaged, and won't go.'
 </p><p>  His rival, who was also the Queen's sworn oculist, was Roger Grant, who, report said, was originally a tinker, and afterwards an anabaptist preacher in Southwark.
      <quote rend="blockquote">   <l>Her Majesty sure was in a Surprise,</l>
        <l> Or else was very short sighted;</l>
        <l> When a Tinker was sworn to look after her Eyes,</l>
        <l> And the Mountebank Read was Knighted.</l>
</quote> He also advertised largely, and published lists of his cures, with certificates from the mayor and aldermen of Durham, Northampton, Coventry, Hull, etc., touching the authenticity of his cures. How these were procured is fully explained in a little tract called 'A Full and True ACCOUNT of a Miraculous CURE of a Young MAN in Newington, That was Born BLIND, and was in Five Minutes brought to Perfect Sight, by Mr. ROGER GRANT, Oculist,' <date value="1709">1709</date>. The case in question was advertised by Grant in the Daily Courant of July 30, <date value="1709">1709</date>, and the little book ruthlessly exposes the fraudulent manner in which the certificate was obtained.
 </p><p>  As has been said before, quackery was universal; nay, it had the sanction of being practised by royalty, for was not the Queen an arch quack when she touched for the  evil'? She was the last of a long line of sovereigns, from Edward

<pb n="103" id="p.103"/>
 the Confessor, who exercised the supposed royal gift of healing; but this salutary efficacy was not confined to the royal touch alone, if we can believe a little story of Thoresby's 1<note place="foot" n="9"> Diary, July 14, <date value="1714">1714</date>. </note>:
' Her Mother Mary Bailey of Deptford, after she had been twelve years blind by the Kings evil was miraculously cured by a handkerchief dipped in the blood of King Charles the First.'
 </p><p>  Misson was present the last time James the Second touched, and has left us a graphic account of the ceremony: ' The King was seated in a Chair of State,<note place="foot" n="10">In the Banqueting Hall, Whitehall.</note> rais'd two or three Steps. The Reverend Father Peter, with his little Band and his sweeping Cloak was standing at the King's Right Hand. After some Prayers, the diseased Person, or those that pretended to be so,<note place="foot" n="11">On this occasion there were 300.</note> were made to pass between a narrow double Rail, which fac'd the King. Each Patient, Rich and Poor, Male and Female, fell upon their knees, one after another, at the King's Feet. The King putting forth his two Hands, touch'd their two Cheeks; the Jesuit, who held a Number of Gold Medals, each fasten'd to a narrow white Ribband, put the Ribband round the Patient's Neck at the same Time that the King touch'd him, and said something tantamount to what they say in France, The King touches thee; God cure thee. This was done in a Trice; and for fear the same Patient should crowd into the File again, to get another Medal,<note place="foot" n="12">These 'touch pieces' had on one side St. George overcoming the dragon, and were called 'angels.'
</note> he was taken by the Arm, and carry'd into a safe place. When the King was weary of repeating the same action, and touching the Cheek or Chin, Father Peter the Almoner, presented him with the End of the String which was round the Patient's Neck. The Virtue pass'd from the Hand to the String, from the String to the Cloaths, from the Cloaths to the Skin, and from the Skin to the Root of the Evil: After this Royal Touch, those that were really ill were put into the Hands of Physicians; and those that came only for the Medal, had no need of other Remedies.' This last sentence explains a great deal.
 </p><p>  William III. did not touch, but gave away the money hitherto spent on the touch pieces, etc., in charity. But Anne, as a thoroughly legitimate English monarch, and a

<pb n="104" id="p.104"/>
 Stuart to boot, kept up the fiction of her curative powers. She tried it on Dr. Johnson, but it had no effect; and his recollections of the ceremony were very vague. ' He had,' he said, 'a confused but somehow a sort of solemn recollection of a lady in diamonds, and a long black hood.' But then the staunch old Jacobite used to declare that 'his mother had not carried him far enough; she should have taken him to ROME' (to the Pretender).
 </p><p>  Anne touched the very first year of her reign, for Luttrell says, 'The Service and Attendance belonging to the Ceremony of touching for the King's Evil went for Bath last Week, her Majesty desiring to touch there.' Illness sometimes prevented her: ' Her Majesty did not touch yesterday for the evil as design'd, having the gout in her hands.' <note place="foot" n="13">Luttrell, March 20, <date value="1703">1703</date>.</note>
  </p><p> It evidently required some little interest to get touched, for Swift writes<note place="foot" n="14">Journal, May 8, <date value="1711">1711</date>.</note> to Stella: ' I visited the Duchess of Ormond this morning . . . I spoke to her to get a lad touched for the Evil. . . . But the Queen has not been able to touch, and it now grows so warm, I fear she will not at all.'
 </p><p>  Notices were duly posted in the Gazette as to when she touched or not, and in that of May 24/28, <date value="1705">1705</date>, we find one which would lead us to imagine that some unfair practice had arisen: 'It is also Her Majesty's Command, That all Persons who shall then apply to be touched, shall bring a Certificate to Her Majesty's Serjeant Surgeon, signed by the Minister and Churchwardens of the Parish where such Person shall then reside, that they never had before received the Royal Touch, as been heretofore accustomed.'
  </p><p> It is impossible to take up a newspaper of that time without encountering some quack advertisements, and the quantity of handbills <note place="foot" n="15">If the pale Walker pants with weak'ning Ills,
         His sickly Hand is stor'd with Friendly Bills:

 The Hysterick Tincture,' 'The White Cardialgic Powder,'
'The Volatile Cordial Pill,' 'Tinctura Benedicta,' ' Electuarium Mirabile,' 'Electuary of the Balm of Gilead.' What a list might be made of them! See what Addison says of them in the Tatler (224). The heading to one is given as a sample of the style of art in the handbill.
  </p><p> This ' Paris Pill and Electuary' is described as follows:
'The Price of a Box of the Pills is 2s. 6d. and a Pot of the Electuary 1s. 6d. of which Pills and Electuary two Boxes &#x0026;  one Pot will be sufficient for any one not very far gone in the Distemper, and Double the Number will heal the Patient if in great Extremity. Sold by J. Sherwood Book Seller at Popings aley Gate fleet street, With a paper of Directions.'

 </p><p>  In another advertisement of 'Dr. Anderson's, or the Famous Scots Pills,' you are requested to 'Beware of Counterfeits, especially an Ignorant pretender, one Muffen, who keeps a China Shop, and is so unneighbourly as to pretend to sell the same Pills within 3 Doors of me.'
 </p><p>  But the quacks were not all stationary; as at present, some were peripatetic, who, after the fashion of these wanderers, had an eloquence of their own, which only Ward can do justice to. Here is a short extract<note place="foot" n="17">London Spy.</note>   of the ' patter ' of those days. 'Gentlemen, you that have a Mind to be Mindful of preserving a Sound Mind in a Sound Body, that is, as the Learned Physician Doctor Honorificicabilitudinitatibusque has

 it, Manus Sanaque in Cobile Sanaquorum, may here, at the expence of twopence, furnish himself with a parcel, which tho' it is but small, yet containeth mighty things of great Use and Wonderful Operation in the Bodies of Mankind, against all Distempers, whether Homogeneal or Complicated; whether deriv'd from your Parents, got by Infection, or proceeding from an ill Habit of your own Body.
  </p><p> 'In the first place, Gentlemen, I here present you with a little inconsiderable Pill to look at, you see not much bigger than a Corn of Pepper, yet in this Diminutive Pampharmica, so powerful in effect, and of such excellent Vertues, that if you have Twenty Distempers lurking in the Mass of Blood, it shall give you just Twenty Stools, and every time it operates, it carries off a Distemper; but if your Blood's Wholesome, and your Body Sound, it will work you no more than the same quantity of Ginger bread. I therefore call it, from its admirable Qualities, Pilula Ton dobula, which signifies in the Greek, The Touch Stone of Nature; For by taking of this Pill you will truly discover what state of Health or Infirmity your Constitution is then under.
  </p><p> 'In the next place, Gentlemen, I present you with an excellent outward application, call'd a Plaister; good against Green Wounds, old Fistulas and Ulcers, Pains and Aches, Contusions, Tumours or King's Evil, Spasms, Fractures, or Dislocations, or any Hurts whatsoever, received either by Sword, Cane, or Gun Shot, Knife, Saw, or Hatchet, Hammer, Nail or Tenter hook, Fire, Blast or Gunpowder, &#x0026;c. And will continue its Vertue beyond Credit; and as useful seven years hence as at this present Moment, that you may lend it to your Neighbours in the time of Distress and Affliction; and, when it has perform'd Forty Cures 'twill be ne'er the Worse, but still retain its Integrity. Probatum Est,' etc.
 </p><p>  Dr. Zachary Pearce, Bishop of Rochester, who wrote No. 572 of the Spectator (altered by Addison), gives an amusing account of one of these quacks. 'I remember one of those Public-spirited Artists at Hammersmith, who told his Audience " that he had been born and bred there, and that, having a special Regard for the place of his Nativity, he was determined to make a Present of five Shillings to as many as

<pb n="107" id="p.107"/>
 would accept of it." The whole Crowd stood agape, and ready to take the Doctor at his Word; when putting his Hand into a long Bag, as every one was expecting his Crown Piece, he drew out a handful of little Packets, each of which he informed the Spectators was constantly sold at five Shillings and six pence, but that he would bate the odd five Shillings to every Inhabitant of that Place; the whole Assembly immediately closed with this generous Offer, and took off all his Physick, after the Doctor had made them vouch for one another, that there were no Foreigners among them, but that they were all Hammersmith Men.' The whole article is an amusing expose of the quackery then at its height.  'I unluckily called to mind a Story of an Ingenious Gentleman of the last Age, who, lying violently afflicted with the Gout, a Person came and offered his Service to Cure him by a Method, which he assured him was Infallible; the Servant who received the Message, carried it up to his Master, who, enquiring whether the Person came on Foot, or in a Chariot; and being informed he was on Foot: Go, says he, send the Knave about his Business: Was his Method as infallible as he pretends, he would long before now have been in his Coach and Six.'</p>

<p>IT was a great time for our English spas, and 'Spaw Water' was a favourite drink with the temperate. Chief of all, for its curative qualities, and for its society, was Bath, or 'The Bath,' as it was called; and, as it occupies such a prominent position in the social life of this time, more than a passing notice of it is required. Misson's description of it is short but businesslike.  'This Town takes its Name from   the Baths for which it is famous. Several in Switzerland and Germany are called Baden for the same reason. In Winter Bath makes a very melancholy Appearance; but during the Months of May, June, July, and August, there is a concourse of genteel Company, that peoples, enriches, and adorns it; at that Time, Provisions and Lodgings grow dear. Thousands go thither to pass away a few Weeks, without heeding either the Baths or the Waters, but only to divert themselves with good Company. They have Musick, Gaming, Public Walks, Balls, and a little Fair every Day.'
  </p><p> The manners of this 'concourse of genteel company' are thus described by Steele.'<note place="foot" n="1">Spectator, No. 154.</note> 'In the Autumn of the same Year I made my Appearance at Bath. I was now got into the Way of Talk proper for Ladies, and was run into a vast Acquaintance among them, which I always improved to the best Advantage. In all this Course of Time, and some Years


<pb n="109" id="p.109"/>
 following, I found a Sober, Modest Man was always looked upon by both Sexes as a precise unfashioned Fellow of no Life or Spirit. It was ordinary for a Man who had been drunk in good Company, or passed a Night with a Wench, to speak of it next Day before Women for whom he had the greatest Respect. He was reproved, perhaps, with a Blow of the Fan, or an Oh Fie, but the angry Lady still preserved an apparent Approbation in her Countenance: He was called a strange wicked Fellow, a sad Wretch; he shrugs his shoulders, swears, receives another Blow, swears again he did not know he swore, and all was well. You might often see Men game in the Presence of Women, and throw at once for more than they were worth, to recommend themselves as Men of Spirit.'
  </p><p> Perhaps the most graphic description of daily life at Bath is given in a sixpenny pamphlet entitled 'A Step to the Bath with a Character of the place' (London, <date value="1700">1700</date>). It is published anonymously, but I have no doubt in my own mind that it was written by Ward, as it is exactly his style, and is published by his publisher. Of course, in his writings, we must not look for polished language; but his descriptions are accurate, and as such well worth having. He thus describes the place:-
  </p><p> 'The first we went to, is call'd the King's; and to it joyns the Queen's, both running in one; and the most famous for Cures. In this Bath was at least fifty of both Sexes, with a Score or two of Guides, who by their Scorbutic Carcasses, and Lackered Hides, you would think they had lain Pickling a Century of Years in the Stygian Lake; Some had those Infernal Emissaries to support their Impotent Limbs: Others to Scrub their Putrify'd Carcasses, like a Race Horse. ... At the Pump was several a Drenching their Gullets, and Gormandizing the Reaking Liquor by wholesale.
   </p><p>'From thence we went to the Cross Bath, where most of the Quality resorts, more fam'd for Pleasure than Cures. Here is perform'd all the Wanton Dalliances imaginable; Celebrated Beauties, Panting Breasts, and Curious Shapes, almost Expos'd to Publick View: Languishing eyes, Darting Killing Glances, Tempting Amorous Postures, attended by soft Musick, enough to provoke a Vestal to forbidden Plea-
<pb n="110" id="p.110"/>
 sure, Captivate a Saint, and charm a Jove: Here was also different Sexes, from Quality to the Honourable Knights, Country Put, and City Madam's.... The Ladies with their floating Jappan Bowles, freighted with Confectionary, Kick- Knacks, Essences and Perfumes, Wade about, like Neptun's Courtiers, suppling their Industrious Joynts. The Vigorous Sparks, presenting them with several Antick Postures, as Sailing on their Backs, then Embracing the Element, sink in Rapture.... The usual time being come to forsake that fickle Element, Half Tub Chairs, Lin'd with Blankets, Ply'd as thick as Coaches at the Play House, or Carts at the Custom House.
   </p><p> Bathing being over for that Day, we went to walk in the Grove, a very pleasant place for Diversion; there is the Royal Oak and several Raffling Shops: In one of the Walks, is several Sets of Nine Pins and Attendants to wait on you: Tipping all Nine for a Guinea, is as common there, as two Farthings for a Porrenger of Barley Broth, at the Hospital Gate in Smithfield. On several of the Trees was hung a Lampoon on the Marriage of one Mr. S - a Drugmonger and the famous Madam S--   of London.
  </p><p> 'Having almost tir'd ourselves with walking, we took a Bench to ease our weary Pedestals. Now, said my Friend, I'll give you an impartial Account of the Perfections, Qualities and Functions, of a few particular Persons that are among this Amphibious Crowd.... To give you a particular Description of each of 'em, will require a Week's time at least. Come, therefore, let's go to some Tipling Mansion, and Carrouse, till we have Exhilerated our Drouthy Souls: To which I readily agreed. About five in the Evening, we went to See a great Match at Bowling: There was Quality, and Reverend Doctors of both Professions, Topping Merchants, Broken Bankers, Noted Mercers, Inns of Court Rakes, City Beaus, Stray'd Prentices, and Dancing-Masters in abundance. Fly, fly, fly, fly, said one; Rub, Rub, rub, rub, cry'd another; Ten Guineas to five I Uncover the Jack, says a third. Damn these Nice Fingers of mine, cry'd my Lord, I Slipt my Bowl and mistook the Bias. Another Swearing he knew the Ground to an Inch, and would hold five Pound his Bowl came in.
<pb id="p.111" n="111"/>
  </p><p> ' From hence, we went to the Groom Porters, where they were a Labouring like so many Anchor Smiths, at the Oake, Back Gammon, Tick Tack, Irish, Basset, and throwing of Mains. There was Palming, Lodging, Loaded Dice, Levant, and Gammoning, with all the Speed imaginable; but the Cornish Rook was too hard for them all. The Bristol Fair Sparks had but a very bad bargain of it; and little occasion for Returns. Bank Bills, and Exchequer Notes were as Plenty, as Pops at the Chocolate Houses or Patternoster Row. Having satisfied our Curiosity here; we left them as busie a shaking their Elbows, as the Apple women in Stocks Market, Wallnuts in October.
  </p><p> 'And meeting with three or four more Acquaintance, we stroul'd to a Bristol-Milk Dary-House, and Enjoy'd our selves like brave Bacchanalians.'
  </p><p> This, then, was how the day was spent at Bath, with the exception of when some person of quality gave an entertainment to a select number of visitors-and this they were expected to do. Our writer describes his experience of one:
' The Ball is always kept at the Town Hall, a very spacious Room, and fitted up for that Purpose. During which, the Door is kept by a Couple of Brawny Beadles, to keep out the Mobility, looking as fierce as the Uncouth Figures at Guild-Hall; there was Extraordinary Fine Dancing (and how could it otherwise chuse, for Spouse and I had a Hand in it). A Consort of Delicate Musick, Vocal and Instrumental, perform'd by good Masters; A Noble Collation of dry Sweet Meats, Rich Wine and large Attendance. The Lady who was the Donor, wore an Extraordinary Rich Favour, to distinguish her from the rest, which is always the Custom; and before they break up to chuse another for the next Day, which fell upon a Shentlewoman of Wales; but no ways Derogated from hur Honour, or Disparag'd her Country in the least, but hur was as Noble, and as Generous, as e'er an English Shentlewoman of them all: To hur Honour be it Spoke.'
  </p><p>And he winds up the pamphlet with' A Character of the Bath.'
  </p><p> ' 'Tis neither Town nor City, yet goes by the Name of

 both: five Months in the Year 'tis as Populous as London, the other seven as desolate as a Wilderness.   Its chiefest Inhabitants are Turn-spit-Dogs; and it looks like Lombard Street on a Saints day. During the Season, it hath as many Families in a House as Edenborough; and Bills are as thick for Lodgings to be Let, as there was for Houses in the Fryars on the Late Act of Parliament for the Dissolution of Priviledges; but when the Baths are useless, so are their Houses, and as empty as the new Buildings by St. Giles in the Fields; The Baths I can compare to nothing but the Boylers in Fleet Lane or Old Bedlam, for they have a reaking steem all the Year. In a Word, 'tis a Valley of Pleasure, yet a sink of Iniquity; Nor is there any Intrigues or Debauch Acted in London, but is Mimick'd here.'
  </p><p> The Water was bottled       and  sold, and in order to guarantee its purity an advertisement was issued in <date value="1706">1706</date>:

It was supplied in London fresh three times a week, as we find by another advertisement of <date value="1709">1709</date>.

 </p><p>  People, however, went to Tunbridge to drink the waters, not to bathe in them. So was it with Epsom Wells, which was decidedly lower in tone.   From  its easy access to London, it was crowded with citizens-and some very questionable characters. If Bath allowed some licence to its frequenters, Epsom gave more. 'But if you were not so monstrous lewd, the freedom of Epsom allows almost nothing to be scandalous.'<note place="foot" n="2">Epsom Wells, Shadwell.
</note>
  </p><p> The Epsom season began on Easter Monday, and one advertisement will sufficiently indicate its character.  <date value="1707">1707</date>.
'The New Wells at Epsom, with variety of Raffling Shops, will be open'd on Easter Monday next. There are Shops now to be Let, at the said Wells for a Bookseller, Pictures, Haberdasher of Hats, Shoomaker, Fishmonger, and Butcher; with conveniences for several other Trades. <figure id="fig.00009" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.006.DO01.00009"><head></head> </figure> It's design'd that a very good Consort of Musick shall attend and play there Morning and Evening during the Season; and nothing will be demanded for the Waters drunk there.' Pinkethman would take his performing dogs down there, and Mr. Clinch, with the wonderful voice, would spend the season there. Morris-dancing and other sports were got up, and at last they had races, which have since evolved that national saturnalia the Derby.
 </p><p>  They had not yet analysed these purgative waters, and consequently 'Epsom salts' were unknown, so that people, did they wish for them, must either go to Epsom, or buy the water in London, where almost all the other 'Spaw' waters could be procured. It is astonishing how they could drink the quantity they are recorded to have done-i.e. if those accounts are trustworthy. Brown, in one of his ' Letters from the Dead to the Living,' talks of a lady 'that has drank two

 </p><p> There was, and even yet is, a mildly chalybeate spring at Hampstead, which made that beautiful northern suburb very fashionable. The well has been lately altered, and the old Assembly Rooms, which had lasted from Anne's time, were pulled down in the early part of <date value="1882">1882</date>. Old gardens have been grubbed up, and fine new villas set a-top of them. It is only a question of time as to when the trees in Well Walk will die and be no more, and but a few houses will remain to attest the glory of Hampstead in Queen Anne's time, when the Kit Cats made it their summer meeting-place. Like all places of amusement then, the spirit of gambling had invaded it, and either Swift or Steele notices that: 'By letters from Hampstead which give me an account, there is a late institution there, under the name of a RAFFLING SHOP; which is, it seems, secretly supported by a person who is a deep practitioner in the law, and out of tenderness of conscience, has, under the name of his maid Sisly, set up this easier way of conveyancing and alienating estates from one family to another. <note place="foot" n="3">The Tatler, No. 59.

 Arms Inn in Haughton Street in Clare Market, over against New Inn back Gate, is lately discovered a Spring of Purging Water, known by the name of Holy-well, or the London Water, exceeding for their Cathartic Excellency, all other Purging Waters; working in small quantities without neglect of Business. This Water has been tried and approved of by some of the best Physicians. To be had at the Pump, at the place aforesaid at 2d. the Quart, and to those that buy it to Retail it, at the Usual Rates.'
 </p><p>  One of those in the country was Buxton, of which we get the following notice in <date value="1705">1705</date>: 'Whereas the Bath House at Buxton, in Derbyshire, so famous in the North for divers Cures, hath of late Years been mismanaged, by disobliging Persons of Quality and others usually resorting to the said Bath; this is therefore to give Notice to all Persons of Quality and Gentry of Both Sexes, That Care has now been taken, by his Grace the Duke of Devonshire, to remedy the like Treatment, for the future, by sending down from London a fitting and obliging Person sufficiently qualified: So that now all Persons resorting to the said Bath will meet with Civil Usage, and have the best of every thing for Man and Beast at reasonable rates.' Then there were springs at Scarborough, Bury, Astrop, Croft, Holt, and Blurton Spaw Water, which was belauded by Floyer. Of course these are not a tithe of those which were locally famous, but were not pushed into public notoriety.
    </p><p>Foreign mineral waters were in use, but evidently only for medicinal purposes. 'Purging Spaw Waters newly brought over from Germany, to be sold at the Two Golden Images in King Street, near St. James's.' And they were sold at prices varying from 12s. per doz. or 1s. per flask, to 5s. per doz.
   </p><p> Not only were the hot springs of Bath frequented for the purposes of bathing, but the Turkish bath was peculiarly an institution of this reign, and the 'Hummums' or 'Bagnios' were well frequented, until the latter got an evil reputation, and the name of Bagnio came to be regarded as synonymous with a disorderly house. Some of the medical men of the time took up the subject of bathing with relation to health, and, as is generally the case, took opposite views; some

'An Apology for the Bath,' having previously printed a Latin tract, 'De Thermis Britannicis.'
   </p><p>Ward describes a visit to the Hummums in Covent Garden with a friend, who suggested to him  <note place="foot" n="4">The London Spy.
</note> 'if you will be your Club towards Eight Shillings, we'll go in and Sweat, and you shall feel the effects of this Notable Invention.' Let him tell his experiences in his own words. 'We now began to unstrip, and put ourselves in a Condition of enduring an Hour's Baking, and when we had reduc'd our selves into the Original state of Mankind, having nothing before us to cover our Nakedness, but a Clout no bigger than a Fig leaf, our Guide led us to the end of our Journey, the next Apartment, which I am sure, was as hot as a Pastry Cooks Oven to Bake a White Pot; that I began immediately to melt, like a piece of Butter in a Basting Ladle, and was afraid I should have run all to Oyl by the time I had been in six Minutes; The bottom of the Room was Pav'd with Freestone; to defend our feet from the excessive heat of which, we had got on a pair of new-fashion'd Brogues, with Wooden Soles after the French Mode, Cut out of an Inch Deal Board; or else like the Fellow in the Fair, we might as well have walk'd cross a hot Iron Bar, as ventur'd here to have Trod bare Foot. As soon as the Fire had tapt us all over, and we began to run like a Conduit Pipe, at every Pore, our Rubber arms his Right Hand with a Gauntlet of coarse hair Camlet, and began to curry us with as much Labour, as a Yorkshire Groom does his Master's best Stone Horse; till he made our Skins as smooth as a Fair Ladies Cheeks, just wash'd with Lemon Posset, and greas'd over with Pomatum. At last I


<pb id="p.117" n="117"/>
 grew so very faint with the expence of much Spirits, that I begg'd as hard for a Mouthful of fresh Air, as Dives did for a drop of Water; which our attendance let in at a Sash-Window, no broader than a Deptford Cheese Cake; but, however, it let in a Comfortable Breeze that was very Reviving: when I had foul'd many Callico Napkins, our Rubber draws a Cistern full of Hot Water, that we might go in, and Boil out those gross Humours that could not be Emitted by Perspiration. Thus, almost Bak'd to a Crust, we went into the hot Bath to moisten our Clay, where we lay Soddening our selves like Deer's Humbles design'd for Minc'd Pies, till we were almost Parboiled .. . then after he had wiped me o'er with a dry Clout, telling us we had Sweat enough, he reliev'd us out of Purgatory, and carried us into our Dressing Room; which gave us such Refreshment, after we had been stewing in our own Gravy, that we thought ourselves as happy as a Couple of English Travellers, Transported in an Instant, by a Miracle from the Torrid Zone into their own Country. Our expence of Spirits had weakened Nature and made us drowsie; where having the Conveniency of a Bed, we lay down and were rubb'd like a couple of Race Horses after a Course.'
  </p><p> An advertisement of these baths tells us fully of the extent of the accommodation they afforded. 'At the Hummum's in Covent Garden are the best accommodation for Persons of Quality to Sweat or Bath every day in the week, the Conveniences of all kinds far exceeding all other Bagnios or Sweating Houses both for Rich and Poor. Persons of good Reputation may be accommodated with handsom Lodgings to lye all Night. There is also a Man and Woman who Cups after the Newest and easiest method. In the Garden of the same House is also a large Cold Bath of Spring Water, which, for its Coldness and Delicacy, deserves an equal Reputation with any in use.'
 </p><p>  There were also 'John Evans's Hummums in Brownlow Street near <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName>,' 'John Pindar's (The German Sweating House) in Westmoreland Court, in Bartholomew Close, near Aldersgate Street,' and 'The Queen's Bagnio in Long Acre,' kept by Henry Ayme, chirurgeon; where not only could you have a bath for 5s., or two or more 4s. each, but

<pb n="118" id="p.118"/>
 there was 'a lesser Bagnio, of a lower Rate, for the Diseased and Meaner Sort.' 'There is no Entertainment for Women after Twelve of the Clock at Night, but all Gentlemen that desire Beds, may have them for Two Shillings per Night, for one single Person, but if two lie together Three Shillings both; which Rooms and Beds are fit for the Entertainment of Persons of the highest Quality, and Gentlemen.'
 </p><p>  Then there was the Royal Bagnio in Newgate Street, at the Corner of what now is Bath (formerly Bagnio) Street. There was also Pierault's Bagnio, which was in St. James's Street, and was established about <date value="1699">1699</date>. 'The charge of going in is 5s.-if lie all Night 10s. each. Here also is a Cold Bath, for which they take 2s. 6d. each Person.'
  </p><p> The disciples of cold bathing might be suited at 'A Convenient large Cold Bath, that is Erected upon an Excellent Cold Spring, adjoyning to the Bowling Green in Queen Street in the Park, Southwark. ... Prices 1s. and 6d.
-The Chair 2s.'; and at No. 3 Endell Street was a bath which, tradition says, was used by Queen Anne. It was about twelve or fourteen feet square, and was originally lined with old blue and white Dutch tiles. I can find nothing confirming this tradition, which may or may not have a foundation in fact.</p>

<p>RELIGIOUS life in Anne's time was not active-at least in the Church of England. Even the dignitaries of the Church, with very few exceptions, were men of no mark, nor were there any among the inferior clergy who could be called to the higher estate, and so help to leaven and wake up the Episcopate. For the Church was asleep, and with the exception of the Sacheverell episode-when the name of the Church was dragged in to serve party purposes--nothing was heard of it. There were priests in the livings then as now, and they duly baptized, married, preached to, and buried their flock ; but there was little vitality in their ministrations, little or no zeal or earnestness as to the spiritual state of those committed to their charge, and very little of practical teaching, in the way of setting before them a higher social standard for them to imitate. The Church services had no life in them ; with the exception of the cathedrals the services were read, and the soul-depressing parson and clerk duet had its usual effect of deadening the religious sensibilities of the so-called worshippers. Why! Addison seems to think that dear old Sir Roger was acting in a most praiseworthy manner in dragooning all his tenants to church, otherwise he confesses they would not have come; but what spiritual good this

<pb n="120" id="p.120"/>
 compulsory attendance did them he does not hint at- probably never thought of: 'My Friend Sir Roger being a good Churchman, has beautified the Inside of his Church with several texts of his own chusing: he has likewise given a handsome Pulpit Cloth, and railed in the Communion Table at his own expence. He has often told me, that at his coming to his Estate he found (his Parishioners) very irregular; and that in order to make them kneel and join in the Responses, he gave every one of them a Hassock and a Common Prayer Book: and at the same time employed an itinerant Singing Master, who goes about the Country for that Purpose, to instruct them rightly in the Tunes of the Psalms; upon which they now very much value themselves, and indeed out-do most of the Country Churches that I have ever heard.
  </p><p> 'As Sir Roger is Landlord to the whole Congregation, he keeps them in very good Order, and will suffer no Body to sleep in it besides himself; for if by chance he has been surprized into a short Nap at Sermon, upon recovering out of it he stands up and looks about him, and if he sees any Body else nodding, either wakes them himself, or sends his Servant to them. . . . As soon as the Sermon is finished, no Body presumes to stir till Sir Roger is gone out of the Church. The Knight walks down from his Seat in the Chancel between a Double Row of his Tenants, that stand bowing to him, on each Side; and every now and then enquires how such an one's Wife, or Mother, or Son, or Father do, whom he does not see at Church; which is understood as a secret reprimand to the Person that is absent.'  <note place="foot" n="1">Spectator, 112.</note>
   </p><p>He then contrasts this parish with a neighbouring one where the squire and parson are at variance-where all the tenants are Atheists and Tithe Stealers. Of course Addison's account is somewhat biassed by his own proclivities; but we may take the tone of Church feeling throughout the country to have been exemplified by the state of Sir Roger's parish before the rather fussy, and certainly eccentric, knight entered upon his high-handed course of compulsory attendance.
  </p><p> How Sunday was spent in London let Misson say: 'The English of all Sects, but particularly the Presbyterians, make


<pb n="121" id="p.121"/>
 profession of being very strict Observers of the Sabbath Day.
   </p><p> 'I believe their Doctrine upon this Head does not differ from ours, but most assuredly our Scruples are much less great than theirs. This appears upon a hundred Occasions; but I have observ'd it particularly in the printed Confessions of Persons that are hang'd; Sabbath breaking is the Crime the poor Wretches always begin with. If they kill'd Father and Mother, they would not mention that Article, till after having profess'd how often they had broke the Sabbath. One of the good English Customs on the Sabbath Day, is to feast as nobly as possible, and especially not to forget the Pudding. It is a common Practice, even among People of good Substance, to have a huge piece of Roast Beef on Sundays, of which they stuff till they can swallow no more, and eat the rest cold, without any other Victuals, the other Six Days of the Week.'
  </p><p> Another quotation from Addison shows at all events his feeling as to the state of the Church at that time: 'After some short Pause, the old Knight turning about his Head twice or thrice, to take a Survey of this great Metropolis, bid me observe how thick the City was set with Churches, and that there was scarce a single Steeple on this side Temple Bar. A most Heathenish Sight ! says Sir Roger: There is no Religion at this End of the Town. The Fifty new Churches will very much mend the Prospect; but Church-work is slow-- Churchwork is slow.'  <note place="foot" n="2">Spectator, 383.</note>
  </p><p> There is no doubt but that the Clergy as a body were but little thought of. Of course there were good and pious men then as now, but there is no disguising the fact that the majority showed an indifference to the spiritual well-being of the people, which could not fail to react upon themselves, and foster a feeling bordering upon contempt. Although those were not the days of deep thought, or scientific speculation, there was a great deal of freethought in existence; and although Atheists were professed to be looked upon, as they are now, as moral lepers, yet still there they were.
  </p><p> Perhaps one of the most curious symptoms of the times

  </p><p>  Addison, commenting on this custom, and the chaplain's status generally, remarks,<note place="foot" n="4">Tatler, 255.</note> ' In this case I know not which to censure, the Patron or the Chaplain, the insolence of power or the abjectness of dependence. For my own part, I have often blushed to see a gentleman, whom I know to have much more wit and learning than myself, and who was bred up with me at the University upon the same foot of a Liberal Education, treated in such an ignominious manner, and sunk beneath those of his own rank, by reason of that Character, which ought to bring him honour.'
  </p><p> Again, in the Guardian (No. 163) his position is described:
'I have, with much ado, maintained my post hitherto at the dessert, and every day eat tart in the face of my patron; but how long I shall be invested with this privilege, I do not know. For the servants, who do not see me supported as I was in my old lord's time, begin to brush very familiarly by me, and thrust aside my chair when they set the sweetmeats on the table.'
  </p><p> A curious confirmation of one of Oldham's statements is found in a little brochure of the early part of Anne's reign, <note place="foot" n="5">The English Lady's Catechism.</note>
'I turn away my Footman for aspiring to my Woman, her I marry to my Lord's high Chaplain, and give her six Changes of my old cast off Cloaths for her Dowry.'
  </p><p> Royalty, even, was not exempt from this failing of snubbing the chaplains. Swift writes,<note place="foot" n="6">Journal to Stella, Oct. 6. <date value="1711">1711</date>.

</p><p>The vestments, when officiating, were simple, consisting of a cassock and full surplice-the black gown being used for preaching.

 </p><p>The church furniture was not very extravagant, as is exemplified by the following advertisement: 'Lost the 20th of August at Night, out of St. Bennets, Grace Church viz, a purple Velvet Cushion, with purple and gold Tassels; The Covering of 2 Cushions very old of the same.

 </p><p>  Benefices were then trafficked in. 'The next Advowson or Presentation to a Church of about 200&#x00A3;. per annum, four score and ten Miles from London, is to be dispos'd of, on very reasonable Terms, to any Clergy man of a good Character for Learning and Morals.

 </p><p>  There were a few black sheep among the clergy. The London Gazette for Nov. 3/6, <date value="1707">1707</date>, has an advertisement commencing, 'Where as one William Sale was some Years since Convicted in the Ecclesiastical Court at Canterbury, of having forged Holy Orders for himself, and for his own Father,' etc., and it goes on to cite him to appear before the Archbishop of Canterbury, or the Bishop of Rochester, and produce his true orders, if he had any--or, if not, he would be prosecuted.

<pb n="126" id="p.126"/>

  </p><p> And in the London Gazette for March 18/22, <date value="1703">1703</date>, the clergy are warned against one 'Abraham Gill (aged upwards of 30 years, middle statur'd, some gray Hairs, wearing sometimes a light Wig, sometimes a darker, sanguine Complexion, bold and Confident in Conversation, strong Voice, a North Country Pronunciation, writing a Clerk like Hand, as having been some time employ'd under an Attorney. Travelling the Country with a Woman and 3 or 4 Children, sometime since forged Letters of Orders, under the Hand and Episcopal Seal of the Lord Bishop of Chester,' etc.
  </p><p>  Swift, too, writes, <note place="foot" n="8">Journal to Stella, May 5, <date value="1711">1711</date>.</note> 'I walked here after nine, two miles, and I found a parson drunk, fighting with a seaman, and Patrick and I were so wise as to part them, but the seaman followed him to Chelsea, cursing at him, and the parson slipped into a house, and I know no more. It mortified me to see a man in my coat so overtaken.'
  </p><p>  It would be impossible to write of the Church of England in Anne's reign without mentioning Dr. Sacheverell,whose two famous sermons brought about his impeachment and sentence to three years' suspension. In them he condemned Dissenters and those Churchmen who sympathised with them, lashing, with his oratory, the high ones of the land-and Godolphin especially, as was believed, under the name of 'Volpone.' Then rose the war-cry of 'High Church and Sacheverell!' which even the Queen could not avoid: 'God bless the Queen. We hope your Majesty is for High Church and Sacheverell;' and presumably she was, for the very month his suspension expired she presented him with the valuable living of St. Andrew's, Holborn. High Churchism then meant intolerance, and Sacheverell was the puppet pulled by wires held by others.
  </p><p>  There is a curious contemporary skit which is worth
 reproducing, for two reasons-first, as showing the style of
 literature then used in party warfare; and second, because it
 gives an approximate illustration of the Hockley in the Hole
 combatants mounted on the stage. In fact, the whole thing
 is a travesty on the bombastic challenges of those doughty
 heroes.</p>

</p><p>   Should anyone care to see to what depth the Church of England had sunk, as far as care of the fabric of the churches went, let him read 'Miscellany Accounts of the Diocese of Carlisle, &#x0026;c., <date value="1703">1703</date>-4,' by Wm. Nicholson, late Bishop of Carlisle: London, Geo. Bell &#x0026;  Sons, <date value="1877">1877</date>.
</p><p>   The two most notable events in the reign, in connection with the Church, were the foundation of Queen Anne's Bounty, and the building of fifty new churches. In the times of the Crusades, a tax of first-fruits and tenths had been imposed for the purposes of prosecuting the Holy Wars, and it had never been taken off. Henry VIII., of course, seized upon it as his own royal perquisite, and so it continued. Charles II. found it handy to provide for his seraglio; and probably, had it not been for the very strenuous exertions of Bishop Burnet with both William and Mary, and afterwards with Anne, it might never have reverted to the Church.
</p><p>   As it was, Queen Anne surrendered it in a most graceful manner, making it her birthday present to the nation in <date value="1704">1704</date>. Her birthday (Feb. 6) fell that year on a Sunday, but she kept it on the Monday, and on that day sent a message to her faithful Commons that it was her desire to make a grant of her whole revenue derived from the first-fruits, and tenths, for the benefit of the poorer clergy. The Commons lost no time in passing a Bill in acquiescence with the royal wish, even broadening its basis-enabling other persons to make grants for the same purpose.  This latter addition encountered some opposition in the Lords, but eventually became law.
</p><p>   The clergy were naturally grateful, and on Feb. 15 the clergy of both Provinces waited on her Majesty, with addresses of thanks for her kindness; and the lower house of Convocation for the Province of Canterbury returned their thanks to the Commons for their readiness in complying with the Queen's desire. On April 3 of the same year the Queen gave her royal assent to the Act. That it was needed is evidenced by the fact that the Commissioners found there were 5,597 livings under 50&#x00A3;. per annum, which were capable of augmentation. The increase of the income of the poorer


<pb n="130" id="p.130"/>
 clergy was its first intention: now the scheme has widened, and grants towards building parsonage-houses, etc., are made. Still, Queen Anne's name remains attached to it in grateful remembrance.</p>
   <p>It was estimated that it would bring in an income of
6,000&#x00A3;. per annum. How the fund is now administered may be learned from the following extract from the Globe of Feb. 15, <date value="1882">1882</date>. 'In Convocation of York yesterday a Committee was appointed to report upon the constitution and management of Queen Anne's Bounty. It was stated that the income of the Bounty is 15,000&#x00A3;., and that the cost of management is between 7,000&#x00A3;. and 8,000&#x00A3;.'  <note place="foot" n="10"> This statement was afterwards modified in the Globe of June 21, <date value="1882">1882</date>.
'The Report of the auditor, Mr. Charles Garlant, states that the cost of administration of the bounty fund is approximately 17s. 6d. per cent. on the receipts and payments generally, and &#x00A3; 2. 10s. per cent. if items on capital account are altogether excluded.'</note> Comment on this is superfluous.</p>
  <p> London was growing bigger, but with the extension of house-building there was no commensurate increase of church accommodation; so the Upper House of Convocation presented an address to the Queen upon the subject, and the Lower House petitioned the House of Commons. The outcome' of this was, that the Queen sent a message to the latter, calling their attention to the state of spiritual destitution, and recommending them to further 'so good and pious a work.' The Commons dutifully replied that, although they had an expensive war on hand, and heavy burdens to bear besides, yet they would be happy to do their part, and consequently the session of <date value="1711">1711</date> saw the royal assent given to an Act for building fifty new churches within the Bills of Mortality, to meet the expense of which was assigned the duty on coals, which had defrayed the expenses of building St. Paul's. Convocation returned thanks, and the fifty churches were eventually built.
  </p><p>The tone of the Church at that time was essentially Protestant.  And no wonder. William   the Deliverer was warm in men's memory; and men, fearing a repetition of Roman supremacy, as in the times of the second James, unreasoningly went in the opposite direction, probably without

  </p><p> Queen Bess was the Madonna of the Protestants, and
'her glorious Memory' was a watchword of the party. Nov.
17, the anniversary of her accession to the throne, was celebrated in the same manner as Nov. 5 used to be, until police control interfered with it. One Nov. 17 in Queen Anne's reign, that of <date value="1711">1711</date>, was rendered historically famous by the steps the Government took in the suppression of this carnival. A contemporary account <note place="foot" n="12">The Protestant Post Boy, Nov. 17/20, <date value="1711">1711</date>.</note> is as follows: 'Nov. 20. Upon information, That the Effigies of the Devil, the Pope and his Attendants were to be carry'd in Procession, and, according to Custom, burnt on Saturday last, the 17th Inst. being the Anniversary of Queen ELIZABETH'S Accession to the Crown, of ever Pious and most Glorious Memory, the Government apprehending that the same might occasion Tumults in this Populous City, thought fit to prevent it. Accordingly, on Friday last, about Twelve a Clock at Night, some of Her Majesty's Messengers, sustain'd by a Detachment of Grenadiers of the Foot Guards, with their Officer, were order'd to go to an Empty House in Angel Court, <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName>, which being broke Open, they found in it the Effigies of the Devil, that of the POPE on his Right hand, and that of a Young Gentleman in a Blue Cloth Coat, with Tinsel Lace, and a Hat with a White Feather, made of Cut Paper, seated under a large Canopy; as also the Figures of Four Cardinals, Four Jesuits, and Four Franciscan Fryars, and a large Cross about Eighteen Foot High; all which, being put on several Carts were, about Two a Clock in the Morning, carry'd to the Cock Pit, and there lodg'd in a Room between the


<pb n="132" id="p.132"/>
 Council Chamber, and the Right Honourable the Earl of Dartmouth's Secretary's Office.  Moreover, on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday the Trained Bands of London and Westminster were under Arms; so that there was no Pope Burnt, tho' we hear of one that was Drown'd.  It may, perhaps, appear strange that a Popular Rejoycing so grateful to this PROTESTANT City, which was never attempted to be quash'd but in K. James the Second's Reign, should, at this Juncture, be interrupted: But, to be sure, those who did it had very good Reasons for their Management.'
  </p><p> Swift, of course, gives Stella all the gossip about it, and says the Whigs laid out about a thousand pounds upon the proposed show. 'They did it by Contribution. Garth gave five guineas; Dr. Garth I mean, if ever you heard of him.' Swift afterwards went to see the effigies, and his report very much modifies his previous account: 'The fifteen images that I saw were not worth forty pounds, so I stretched a little when I said a thousand.  The Devil is not like lord treasurer; they were all your odd antick masks, bought in Common Shops.'
  </p><p> The last of them is told in a paragraph of the Post Boy, July 1/3, <date value="1712">1712</date>: 'Yesterday, were disrobed at the Cockpit the Effigies of the Devil, the Person who has pretended to disturb the Settlement of the Protestant Succession of the House of Hanover, the Pope, Cardinals &#x0026;c.

</p><p> Misson gives a formidable list of religious sects then in existence, to which, of course, owing to the vastly superior wisdom and knowledge of this nineteenth century, we have enormously added and improved upon. He says that there were, in his time, in England, 'Antinomians, Hederingtonians, Theaurian Joanites, Seekers, Waiters, Brownists, Reevists, Baronists, Wilkinsonians, Familists, Ranters, Muggletonians, &#x0026;c., &#x0026;c. All these, and nothing at all, are just one and the same thing: Christianity is overwhelm'd with Sects enough already, without our studying to multiply them chimerically .... Besides the Religion which serves God in the Church of England, and which is the reigning Religion in England, there are several Sorts of Sectaries; the Presbyterians are the Chief and most numerous .... The Independents were a Branch of Presbytery, but they are now united again. Arminianism (if the Propositions of Arminius ought to give the odious name of a Sect) is spread every where. Here and there also you meet with a Millennarian; but I know there is a particular Society, tho' it makes but little Noise, of People, who tho' they go by the Name of Sabbatharians,<note place="foot" n="17">'The Common people call them Seventh Day Men.'</note> make Profession of expecting the Reign of a Thousand Years without participating in the other Opinions, which are ascrib'd to the ancient Millenarians. These Sabbatharians are so call'd,

<pb n="136" id="p.136"/>
 because they will not remove the Day of Rest from Saturday to Sunday. They leave off Work betimes on Friday Evening, and are very rigid Observers of their Sabbath.... England hath also Anabaptists of Several sorts .... Within these few Weeks there is sprung up a new Sect of People, that say they are Mystical Theologists, and that take the name of Philadephians,' etc.
  </p><p> This is very far from being an exhaustive list of the sects then in existence, and it is not worth while wasting time in hunting up the names and history of any more.
  </p><p> John Wesley was born in Anne's reign, and Matthew Henry died in it, whilst Calamy lived during the whole of it;
<figure id="fig.00014" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.006.DO01.00014"><head></head> </figure> but the most prominent nonconformist in London was Daniel Burgess, whose Theatre, or meeting-house, in Carey Street was gutted by the Sacheverell mob, and had to be repaired at the expense of Government. Of this meeting-house Brown says: 'For as it is not properly call'd the House of God, but Mr. Burgess's, so Mr. Burgess, not God, is there worshipped. Prayer and Praise is the proper Worship of God, but here they meet to hear Daniel lay about him, with his merry Stories and Theatrical Actions, which is at least an Amusement they think worth their while.'
  </p><p> And this is one of Daniel's 'merry Stories.' Preaching one day on 'the Robe of Righteousness,' he said: 'If any of
                <pb id="p.137" n="137"/> you would have a good and cheap suit, you will go to Monmouth Street; if you want a suit for life, you will go to the Court of Chancery; but, if you wish for a suit that will last to eternity, you must go to the Lord Jesus Christ, and put on his Robe of Righteousness.'
  </p><p> Swift speaks of him in Tatler 66. 'There is my friend and merry Companion Daniel. He knows a great deal better than he speaks, and can form a proper discourse as well as any orthodox neighbour.' And this, probably, is a true estimate of his character. Anyhow, he drew, and his meetinghouse was the most popular in London.

  </p><p> There was an insane dislike to Quakers in Queen Anne's reign, and I have not met with one kindly or sympathetic remark about them in all my varied reading of these times. On the contrary, they were represented as thoroughpaced hypocrites, cheats, liars, immoral livers. The generic term applied to a Quaker was Aminadab (why?), and Aminadab was everything that was sly and repulsive. We, who know the quiet, simple folk, whose sect is fast dying out, because they have obtained all the points they strove for, can never for an instant imagine that their forefathers were the sly hypocrites they were painted. Nor were they only lampooned

<pb n="138" id="p.138"/>
 verbally--a Quaker could not be drawn without being caricatured into an unctuous rogue; their very plainness of apparel, the men's plain hats and absence of wigs, and the women wearing the old country steeple-crowned hat and simply made gowns, were made the vehicles of sarcasm; the poverty of their meeting-houses was typified by their preaching and sitting on tubs.
  </p><p> Still, all writers have their dab of dirt to throw at them, and to show how universal it was, a few examples may be given. Swift: <note place="foot" n="18"> Journal to Stella, Jan. 15, <date value="1712">1712</date>.
</note> 'My friend Penn came there, Will Penn the Quaker, at the head of his brethren, to thank the Duke for his kindness to their people in Ireland.  To see a dozen scoundrels with their hats on, and the Duke complimenting with his off, was a good sight enough.' Misson: 'The Quakers are great Fanaticks; there seems to be something laudable in them; to outward Appearance they are mild, simple in all respects, sober, modest, peaceable, nay, and they have the Reputation of being honest; and they often are so. But you must have a Care of being Bit by this Appearance, which very often is only outward;' and afterwards, talking of females preaching, 'the Moment Mrs. Doctor spies a Ribbon, the Spirit moves her, and she falls into one of her Fits; up she gets on the Bottom of some Tub, with her pinch'd up Cap, and her screw'd up Countenance; she Sighs, she Groans, she Snorts through the Nose, and then out she bursts into such a Jargon as no mortal Man can make Head or Tale of.' Mrs. Centlivre, in the 'Beau's Duel': 'I carried her to wait on a Relation of ours that has a Parrot, and whilst I was discoursing about some private Business, she converted the Bird, and now it talks of nothing but the Light of the Spirit, and the Inward Man.' Brown: 'They would be thought the only People of God; tho' their Chief Motive to that impudent Ambition, is, that they may claim the Right of Pillaging and Cheating all the World besides, as AEgyptians. They won't swear, because they may chance to pay for that; but they will lie Confoundedly, because they may chance to get by that.' Ward gives an account of a visit to a Quakers' tavern, which was 'intended chiefly for Watering the Lambs of Grace,


<pb n="139" id="p.139"/>
 and not to succour the Evil off-spring of a Reprobate Generation ;' and he says that 'when they were desirous to Elevate their Lethargick Spirits with the circulation of a Bumper, one fills it, and offers the prevailing Temptation to his left Hand Companion, in these Words, saying, Friend, does the Spirit move thee to receive the good Creature thus plentifully ? The other replies, Yea, Do thou take and enjoy the Fruits of thy own Labour, and by the help of Grace I will drink another as full. Thus did the liquorish Saints quaff it about merrily, after their precise Canting manner.' Even the Tatler (262) has an advertisement, 'Drop'd on Sunday last, a small Roll of Paper, in which was inclos'd the Draught of a Quaker holding forth in a Tub, &#x0026;c.' These examples are quite sufficient to show the universal dislike of this harmless sect, which could only have been induced by the thorough contrast of their homely attire, and plain speech, with the ornate dress and exaggerated verbiage then in vogue.

<p>SPEAKING of lawyers, Addison says:  <note place="foot" n="1">Spectator, 21.</note> 'The Body of the Law is no less encumbered with superfluous Members, that are like Virgil's Army which he tells us was so crouded, many of them had not Room to use their Weapons. This prodigious Society of Men may be divided into the Litigious and Peaceable. Under the first are comprehended all those who are carried down in Coach fulls to Westminster Hall every morning in Term time. Martial's description of this Species of Lawyers is full of Humour:
                    <quote rend="blockquote"><l>Iras et verba locant.</l></quote> Men that hire out their Words and Anger; that are more or less passionate according as they are paid for it, and allow their Client a quantity of wrath proportionable to the Fee which they receive from him. I must, however, observe to the Reader, that above three Parts of those whom I reckon among the Litigious, are such as are only quarrelsome in their Hearts, and have no Opportunity of showing their Passion at the Bar. Nevertheless, as they do not know what Strifes may arise, they appear at the Hall every Day, that they may show themselves in a Readiness to enter the Lists, whenever there shall be Occasion for them.
  </p><p> 'The Peaceable Lawyers are, in the first place, many of the Benchers of the several Inns of Court, who seem to be the Dignitaries of the Law, and are endowed with those Qualifications of Mind, that accomplish a Man rather for a


<pb n="141" id="p.141"/>
 Ruler, than a Pleader; These Men live peaceably in their Habitations, Eating once a Day, and Dancing once a Year, for the Honour of their Respective Societies.
   </p><p>'Another numberless Branch of Peaceable Lawyers, are those young Men, who being placed at the Inns of Court in order to study the Laws of their Country, frequent the Play House more than Westminster Hall, and are seen in all publick Assemblies, except in a Court of Justice. I shall say nothing of those Silent and Busie Multitudes that are employed within Doors in the Drawing up of Writings and Conveyances; nor of those greater Numbers that palliate their want of Business, with a Pretence to such Chamber Practice.'
 </p><p>  Thus we see that the legal world then very much resembled the same now. Briefless barristers were as numerous then, and this seems to have been their life: 'Young Barristers troop down to Westminster at Nine; Cheapen Cravats, and Handkerchiefs, Ogle the Semstresses, take a Whet at the Dog, or a Slice of Roast beef at Heaven, fetch half a dozen turns in the Hall, peep in at the Common Pleas, talk over the News, and so with their Green Bags, that have as little in them as their Noddles, go home again. Summon'd by pensive Sound of Horn to rotten roasted Mutton at Twelve; Leave a Paper in their Doors to study Presidents and Cases for them all the Afternoon; may be heard of at the Devil, or some neighbouring Tavern till One in the Morning.' <note place="foot" n="2"> A Comical View of London and Westminster</note>
  </p><p> We not only note, in this quotation, that the lawyers carried green bags, but we find, in contemporary literature, frequent allusion to these bags, which certainly had been of the same colour ever since Charles the Second's time, and so continued until the reign of George III. Bands were worn, but they were not the little things they are now, and there was no distinctive wig-nay, some men were bold enough to wear their own hair. Lady Sarah Cowper has left a memorandum<note place="foot" n="3">Lives of the Lord Chancellors, etc., Lord Campbell.</note> respecting her father, Lord Cowper, which throws light on this subject: 'The Queen after this was persuaded to trust a Whigg ministry; and in the year <date value="1705">1705</date>, October. she made my father Ld Keeper of the Great Seal in

<pb n="142" id="p.142"/>
 the 41st year of his age-'tis said the youngest Lord Keeper that had ever been. He looked very young, and wearing his own hair made him appear yet more so; which the Queen observing, obliged him to cut it off, telling him the world would say she had given the Seals to a Boy.' But it is said that when he appeared at court in his wig, the Queen had to look at him more than once before she recognised him.
  </p><p>  So much for the barrister. Of the other branch, the attorney, we hear very little. Ward certainly portrays him in no very bright colours. 'He's an Amphibious Monster, that partakes of two Natures, and those contrary; He's a great Lover both of Peace and Enmity; and has no sooner set People together by the Ears, but is Soliciting the Law to make an end of the Difference. His Learning is commonly as little as his Honesty; and his Conscience much larger than his Green Bag. Catch him in what Company soever, you will always hear him stating of Cases, or telling what notice my Lord Chancellor took of him, when he beg'd Leave to supply the deficiency of his Councel. He always talks with as great assurance as if he understood what he only pretends to know: And always wears a Band, and in that lies his Gravity and Wisdom. He concerns himself with no Justice but the Justice of a Cause: and for making an unconscionable Bill, he out does a Taylor.'
 </p><p>  The courts of law were conducted with as much decorum and dignity as now; but there is no doubt that false witnesses could be hired-nay, they had a regular name-' Knights of the Post'; a name which certainly dates back as early as the time of Charles I., when 'a roaring gul and Knight o' th' post' were coupled together. In Anne's time 'Knights of the Post are to be had in the Temple Walks from Morning till Night, for two Pots of Belch, and a Sixpenny slice of Boil'd beef'; and Ward's friend, the attorney,' is so well read in Physiognomy, that he knows a Knight of the Post by his Countenance; and if your Business requires such an Agent, he can pick you up one at a small Warning. He is very understanding in the Business of the Old Bailey and knows as well how to Fee a Jury Man as he does a Barrister. He has a rare knack at putting in Broomstick Bail; and knows a great many more


<pb n="143" id="p.143"/>
 ways to keep a Man out of his Money, than he does to get it him.  Tricks and Quirks he calls the cunning part of the Law; and that Attorney that practises the most knavery, is the Man for his Money.'
   </p><p>Queen Anne's reign was not prolific of great lawyers, although Lords Somers, Cowper, and Harcourt were alive. The two former had the felicity of being scarified by Mrs. Manley in the 'New Atlantis.' The former, under the name of Cicero, is accused of seducing a friend's wife, and then imprisoning, and finally making away with, her husband ; and the latter was charged with committing bigamy. His brother Spencer Cowper, too, was unhappy in his connection with the fair sex, he having been, with three others, arraigned for being concerned in the murder of one Sarah Stout. He was acquitted, and probably remembered the fact when afterwards he was a judge, in which capacity he was very merciful. Lord Cowper put an end to an old custom, by refusing to receive New Year's gifts from the officers of his court and the counsel of his Bar; by which his wife says he lost 3,000&#x00A3;. per annum ; but even then, although his salary was nominally
4,000&#x00A3;., he managed, by fees to which he was entitled, to make it up to 8,000&#x00A3;. If Evelyn is to be believed, he knew how to take care of himself. 'Oct. <date value="1705">1705</date>. Mr. Cowper made Lord Keeper. Observing how uncertain greate officers are of continuing long in their places, he would not accept it unless
&#x00A3; <date value="2000">2000</date> a yeare were given him in reversion when he was put out, in consideration of his loss of practice. His predecessors, how little time soever they had the seal, usually got 100,000, and made themselves barons.'</p>

<p>THE River Thames was then a veritable ' silent highway,' in the sense of affording transport for passengers for short distances. In fact, the wherries then took the places in a great measure of our present cabs; and a cry of 'Next Oars' or
'Sculls,' when anyone made his appearance at the top of
'the Stairs,' was synonymous with 'Hansom' or 'Four Wheeler.'
  </p><p> Poor Taylor, the Water Poet, had, more than half a century before, sung the decadence of this highway, but it still fairly held its own, and was in great request. When Sir Roger went with the Spectator to Spring Gardens, Foxhall (that naughty place where the 'wanton baggage' of a mask tapped the old knight on the shoulder, and asked him if he would drink a bottle of mead with her, and where Sir Roger told the mistress of the house ' He should be a better Customer to her Garden, if there were more Nightingales, and fewer Strumpets'), he never dreamed of going any other way than by boat. He chose out the boatman with the wooden leg, and afterwards regaled him with the remains of their luncheon, to the waiter's astonishment.
  </p><p> Addison was writing a superfine paper 'for gentlemen, by gentlemen,' so he softens down the language for which the river was noted, and ignores the torrent of licentious ribaldry with which every boat greeted each other, and which was known as ' River Wit.' He certainly hints at it, but simply touches it, and then changes the subject. When Sir Roger,


<pb n="145" id="p.145"/>
 in the kindliness of his heart and the forgetfulness of custom, bids the passing boats Good Night, he merely says, 'But to the Knight's great Surprize, as he gave the Good Night to two or three young Fellows a little before our Landing, one of them, instead of returning the Civility asked us what queer old Put we had in the Boat, and whether he was not ashamed to go a Wenching at his Years ? with a great deal of the like Thames Ribaldry. Sir Roger seem'd a little shocked at first, but at length assuming a Face of Magistracy, told us, That if he were a Middlesex Justice, he would make such Vagrants know that Her Majesty's Subjects were no more to be abused by Water than by Land.'
  </p><p> But Brown gives us the unadulterated slang, which cannot possibly be reprinted for general perusal-indeed, his whole account of the river, although it is far too graphic to be omitted, and it gives us certainly the best contemporaneous description we have, must be somewhat expurgated to fit it for modern tastes. 'Finding my Companion thus agreeable to my Humour, I steer'd him down Blackfryars towards the Thames side, till coming near the Stairs, where from their Dirty Benches up started such a noisy multitude of old grizly Tritons, in sweaty Shirts, and short-skirted Doublets, hollowing and hooting out Next Oars and Skullers, shaking their Caps over their bald Noddles, seeming as overjoy'd to see us, as if we had been Foreign Princes come out of stark Love and Kindness to redeem them and their Families from Cruel Popery and Slavery. I bawl'd out as loud as a Speaking Trumpet, Next Oars, and away run Captain Charon from the Front of his wrangling Fraternity, with a Badge upon his Arm, that the World might behold whose Slave he was, and hollow'd to his Man Ben to bring the Boat near, whilst the rest withdrew to their Seats, calling one another Louzy Rogue and Sorry Rascal, giving us a clear passage without further Molestation.
  </p><p> 'Upon my Word, says my friend, I am glad we are past them, for this is one of the most ill looking Rabble, and from whom I had more apprehensions of Danger, than from any I have yet met with. 'Tis all, said I, but an Amusement, step into the Boat, sit down Watermen, row us up to Chelsea: No

<pb n="146" id="p.146"/>
 sooner had we put off into the middle of the Stream, but our Charon and his Assistant (being jolly Fellows) began to scatter their verbal Wildfire on every side of them, their first Attack being on a Couple of fine Ladies with a Footman in the Stern, as follows.... One of the Ladies taking Courage, pluck'd up a Female Spirit of Revenge, and facing us with the Gallantry of an Amazon made the following return' . . Well! that awful piece of river chaff, which is still popularly supposed to arouse the ire of' bargees.' 'Who eat puppy pie under Marlow Bridge ?' was milk and water compared to the fearfully strong language this lady made use of, the mildest part of her speech being, 'talk not to a Woman, you surly Whelp, for you are fit for nothing, but like the Breed you come on, to crawl upon all four, and cry Bow wow at a Bear Garden.' And so on with every boat they met.
  </p><p> 'After rowing for some time, we had arriv'd at that Port to which we had consign'd our selves, where we quitted our Boat, and offering old Charon Three Shillings, he swore he would have a Crown; but having the printed Rates in my Pocket, I was forc'd to lug out my Oracle before the Freshwater Looby would be convinc'd of his Error; and withal told him, Had it been in London, I would have carry'd him before my Lord Mayor, and have had him punish'd, for making, contrary to Law, so unreasonable a Demand. With that he takes the Money, and putting off his Boat, gave us a notable Farewel after the following manner-viz. You're a Couple of Niggardly Sons of -- ; I care not a -- for my Lord Mayor;       the Rogue that printed that Book; take you for a Book-learn'd Blockhead; and confound him that taught you to read; and so we parted.'
  </p><p> Misson says, 'The little Boats upon the Thames, which are only for carrying of Persons, are light and pretty; some are row'd but by one Man, others by two; the former are call'd Scullers, and the latter Oars. They are reckon'd at several Thousands; but tho' there are indeed a great many, I believe the Number is exaggerated. The City of London being very long, it is a great Conveniency to be able sometimes to make Use of this Way of Carriage. You sit at your Ease upon Cushions, and have a Board to lean against; but generally they


<pb n="147" id="p.147"/>
 have no Covering, unless a Cloth, which the Watermen set up immediately, in case of Need, over a few Hoops; and sometimes you are wet to the Skin for all this. It is easy to conceive that the Oars go faster than the Sculls, and accordingly their pay is doubled. You never have any Disputes with them; for you can go to no Part either of London, or the Country above or below it, but the Rate is fix'd by Authority; every Thing is regulated and printed.'

   <p>The river, too, was naturally the place for picnics and pleasure parties--although they were by no means so magnificent as the following <note place="foot" n="2">The Lying Lover, ed. <date value="1704">1704</date>.</note> 'I took five Barges, and the fairest kept for my Company; the other four I fill'd with Musick of all sorts, and of all sorts the best; in the first were Fiddles, in the next Theorbo, Lutes, and Voices. Flutes and such Pastoral Instruments i' th' third. Loud Musick from the fourth did pierce the Air; Each Consort vy'd by turns, which with most Melody shou'd charm our Ears. The fifth the largest of 'em all was neatly hung, not with dull Tapistry, but with green Boughs, Curiously Interlac'd to let in Air, and every Branch with Jessemins, and Orange Poesies deckt. In this the Feast was kept.'
  </p><p> These pleasure barges were more or less ornate, and varied from the ordinary boat, with a tilt of canvas or green boughs to very elaborately carved and gilded ones. The last remaining, in our time, were the State barges of Her Majesty, the Trinity Barge, and the Lord Mayor's and City Companies' State barges. The recollection of the water pageant, on a sunshiny Lord Mayor's day, will never be effaced from the memory of those among us who are old enough to have seen it. It was one of the prettiest sights I ever saw; and a few of these barges may still be seen, utilised at Oxford as College Club boats.
   </p><p> Misson says of barges, 'They give this Name in England to a Sort of Pleasure Boat, at one End of which is a little Room handsomely painted and Cover'd, with a Table in the Middle, and Benches round it; and at the other End, Seats for 8, 10, 12, 30 or 40 Rowers. There are very few Persons of Great Quality but what have their Barges, tho' they do not frequently make use of them. Their Watermen wear a Jacket of the same Colour they give for their Livery, with a pretty large Silver Badge upon their Arm, with the Nobleman's Coat of Arms emboss'd in it. These Watermen have some Privileges, as belonging to Peers; but they have no Wages, and are not domestick Servants: They live in their own Houses with their Families, and earn their Livelihood as they can. The Lord Mayor of London, and the
                                     <pb id="p.149" n="149"/>
 several Companies, have also their Barges, and are carry'd in them upon certain solemn occasions.'
   </p><p> Moored opposite Whitehall was a very large barge with a saloon, and promenade on the top, called the Folly, and this was a favourite place of entertainment. It was a fashionable resort in Pepys' time. He says, 13 Ap. <date value="1668">1668</date>. Spent in the Folly 1s.'; and Queen Mary and some of her attendants paid it a visit. In Anne's reign it was used as a coffee-house, but it no longer was extremely fashionable, as the company was very mixed. As D'Urfey sung:-

    </p><p>'Pray, says my Companion (pointing to the Folly), what noble Structure is that floating upon the Water? I have often heard of Castles in the Air, and this seems to me to be a kind of an Essay towards such a windy Project. That Whimsical piece of Architect, saidI, was design'd as a Musical Summer House for the entertainment of Quality, where they might meet. . . But the Ladies of the Town, finding it as convenient a Rendezvous for their purpose ... drove away their private Enemies, and entirely possess'd themselves of this moveable Mansion, which they have occupied ever since, very much to their advantage. . .

. . .

<pb id="p.151" n="151"/>
 Taking its rise in Hampstead, it meandered along, until it fell into the river at Blackfriars, where it formed a wide and shallow mouth called a Fleet, which was once of such extent that ships of considerable burden could get up it some little distance. In Anne's time, however, it had become a black and fetid sewer. Nobody had a good word for it. Gay never mentions it without abuse.

<p>LONDON, it is scarcely necessary to remark, was very circumscribed in its area compared to its overgrown present dimensions. The northern bank of the river was well occupied from Shadwell to Westminster, opposite Lambeth. On the west the houses went down the northern side of Piccadilly, as far as Apsley House; but Bond Street was only partially built, and there were no houses westward of it. The Edgware Road and Tottenham (or, as it was then called, Hampstead) Road were in existence, but few were the houses in either of them. At the Back of Montague and Southampton Houses, and generally north of Theobald's Road and Clerkenwell, there was nought but fields, dotted here and there with farmhouses-- with the hills of Hampstead and Highgate for a background. Houses ceased, on the eastern side, after Shoreditch, and shortly after passing Whitechapel Church; so that a walk all round inhabited London-skirting the north bank of the river to begin with-might be done in about twelve miles.
   </p><p> Covent Garden was the centre of social life. Soho and Leicester Squares, and thence westward, comprised the limits of the court and fashionable society-that land of luxury for which Gay sighed, but which yet was not perfect.

 They seemed both to have a month's mind to make the best
 of their way single; yet both tugged arm in arm: and when they were in a dirty way, he was but deeper in the mire, by endeavouring to pull out his companion, and yet without helping her. The bridegroom's feathers in his hat all drooped; one of his shoes had lost an heel.

   </p><p> It is only in the poorer neighbourhoods that street cries, nowadays, flourish, and it is only by a visit to them that we can at all realise the babel of sounds that the streets gave forth in the reign of Anne. Luckily, as they differ so much from anything we know of, and are so suggestive of the petty industries then practised, they have been preserved for us by Marcellus Lauron, in his somewhat scarce book, <note place="foot" n="5">Habits and Cryes of the City of London. <date value="1709">1709</date>.</note> from which many illustrations used in this book have been taken.

(Spectator, 251), 'There is nothing which more astonishes a Foreigner, and frights a Country Squire, than the Cries of London. My good Friend Sir ROGER often declares, that he cannot get them out of his Head, or go to sleep for them, the first Week that he is in Town. On the contrary, WILL.

According to 8 &#x0026;  9 Will. III. cap 37, everyone had, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, to sweep and cleanse the road in front of their houses, buildings, or walls, and heap up the dirt for the scavenger to remove, under penalty of 10s.
   </p><p> That no one should throw any ashes, dirt, etc., into the open street before his house, under penalty of 5s., or if it was thrown before any other building, 20s.; but they must deliver the dust to the scavenger (2 Will. and Mary, cap. 8), who must come round daily to collect it, giving notice by ringing a bell or otherwise, or penalty 40s.

   </p><p> The street signs, which were necessary, as houses were not numbered, were very numerous and large, and some were exceedingly costly.  Misson was very much struck with them. 'At London they are commonly very large, and jutt out so far, that in some narrow Streets they touch one another; nay, and run across almost quite to the other Side. They are generally adorn'd with Carving and Gilding; and there are several that, with the Branches of Iron which support them, cost above a hundred Guineas. They seldom write upon the Sign the Name of the Thing represented in it; so that here is no need of Moliere's Inspector. Out of London, and particularly in Villages, the Signs of Inns are suspended in the middle of a great Wooden Portal, which may be look'd upon as a Kind of triumphal Arch to the Honour of Bacchus.'

One Tinker knocks, another bawls, Have you a Brass Pot, Iron Pot, Kettle, Skillet, or a Frying Pan to mend?   Whilst another yelps louder than Homer's Stentor, Two a groat, and Four for Sixpence Mackerel. One draws his Mouth up to his Ears, and howls out, Buy my Flounders, and is followed by an old burly Drab, that screams out the sale of her Mades and her Souls at the same Instant.

     </p><p> Let us turn to a prettier street scene. It is May Day, and, although maypoles are banished to the country, where they still hold their own, MILKMAID ON MAY DAY.  London celebrates it in another fashion. The milkmaids hold their festival, and even Gay's ' Sallow Milkmaid's' cheeks must have brightened at the prospect of such a treat. Confiding customers lent them silver plate, and women's taste and a few ribbons make a gorgeous trophy. Misson could not help being struck with it: 'On the First of May, and the five or six Days following, all the pretty young Country girls that serve the Town with Milk, dress themselves up very neatly, and borrow abundance of Silver

In this Equipage, accompany'd by some of their fellow Milk Maids, and a Bag pipe or a Fiddle, they go from Door to Door, dancing before the Houses of their Customers, in the Midst of Boys and Girls that follow them in Troops, and every Body gives them something.'
    </p><p> And Steele notices: <note place="foot" n="13">Tatler, 166. </note> 'I was looking out of my parlour
 window this morning, and receiving the honours which
 MARGERY, the milk maid to our lane, was doing me, by
 dancing before my door with the plate of her Customers on
 her head,' etc.
    </p><p> In the daytime, after dinner, Hyde Park was the fashionable resort either for promenading, riding, or driving. 'Here
 the people take the Diversion of the Ring: In a pretty high
 place which lies very open they have surrounded a Circumference of two or three hundred Paces Diameter with a sorry
 Kind of Ballustrade, or rather with Poles plac'd upon Stakes,
 but three Foot from the Ground; and the Coaches drive
 round and round this. When they have turn'd for some
 Time round one Way, they face about and turn t'other: So
 rowls the World.' <note place="foot" n="14">Tatler, 166. </note>
    </p><p> But it evidently was falling into evil habits, for on July 1,
 <date value="1712">1712</date>, the Queen found it necessary to issue some rules and
 directions 'for the better keeping Hyde Park in good Order.'
 The gatekeepers were to be always on duty, and not to sell
 ale, brandy, or other liquors. No one should leap over the
 ditches, or fences, or break the latter down. 'No Person to
 ride over the grass on the South side of the Gravelled Coach
 Road . .. excepting Henry Wise, who is permitted to pass
 cross that Part of the Park leading from the Door in the
 Park Wall, next his Plantation.' No grooms or others were to ride over the banks, or slopes, of any pond. No stage coach, hackney coach, chaise with one horse, cart, waggon, or funeral should pass through the park; and no one should cut or lop any of the trees.

<p> AMONG the many places swept away, and yet which many of
 us well remember, is Smithfield, where both cattle and horses
 were sold; and Ward gives a very amusing account of the
 horse sales there. ' From thence we proceeded to the Rails,
 where Country Carters stood Arm'd with their Long Whips,
 to keep their Teams (upon Sale in a due Decorum,) who were
 drawn up into the most sightly order with their fore feet
 Mounted on a Dunghill, and their Heads dress'd up to as
 much advantage as an Inns of Court Sempstress, or the
 Mistress of a Boarding School: Some with their Manes
 Frizzled up, to make 'em appear high Wither'd, that they
 look'd as Fierce as one of Hungess's Wild Boars.  Others
 with their Manes Plaited, as if they had been ridden by the
 Nightmare: And the fellows that attended 'em made as uncouth Figures as the Monsters in the Tempest; amongst these Cattel, here and there, was the Conductor of a Dung Cart, in his Dirty Surplice, wrangling about the Price of a Beast, as a wary Purchaser; and that he ought not to be deceived in the Goodness of the Creature, he must see him stand three fair Pulls at a Post, to which the Poor Jade is ty'd, that he may exert his Strength, and shew the Clown his excellencies; for which he strokes him on the Head, or claps him on the Buttocks, to recompence his Labour.
    </p><p>'We went a little further, and there we saw a parcel of Ragged Rapscallions, mounted upon Scrubbed Tits, scowring

<pb n="166" id="p.166"/>
 about the Rounds, some Trotting, some Galloping, some Pacing, and others Stumbling.
   </p><p>'Pray friend, said I, what are those Eagle Look'd Fellows in their Narrow Brimm'd White Beavers, Jockeys Coats, a Spur in one Heel, and Bended Sticks in their Hands, that are so busily peeping into every Horses Mouth? . . . Those Blades, says my friend, are a Subtle Sort of Smithfield Foxes, called Horse Coursers, who Swear every Morning by the Bridle, that they will not, from any Man, suffer a Knavish trick, or ever do an Honest one. They are a sort of English Jews, that never deal with any Man but they Cheat him; and have a rare Faculty of Swearing a Man out of his Senses, Lying him out of his Reason, and Cozening him out of his Money; If they have a Horse to sell that is Stone Blind, they'll call a Hundred Gods to Witness he can see as well as you can. If he be downright Lame, they will use all the Asseverations that the Devil can assist 'em with, that it is nothing but a Spring Halt; and if he be Twenty Years old, they'll Swear he comes but Seven next Grass, if they find the Buyer has not Judgment enough to discover the Contrary.'
   </p><p>This horse market was of importance to the metropolis, which was supplied from the country fairs, from which the horses came up in droves. 'A Set of Geldings and Mares, just from a Journey to be sold Cheap.' So many were wanted for riding, carriages, and draught purposes. Horsestealing was a crime so extremely prevalent, that it is difficult to take up a paper that does not contain an advertisement respecting a lost or stolen horse.
   </p><p>Some of the inland traffic was still done by means of pack-horses. 'These are.to give Notice to all Gentlemen or others that have occasion to send Goods, or travel from London to Exeter or Plymouth, or from Exeter and Plymouth, or any parts of Cornwall or Devonshire to London; that they may be accommodated for Expedition by Pack Horse Carriage, who set out from the Cross Keys Inn in Wood Street London every Saturday, and from the Mermaid Inn in Exon every Monday. Perform'd, if God permit, by Ebenezer Brookes.' But there were also waggons, which, by


<pb n="167" id="p.167"/>
 the divine permission, started for every town of note in England.
  </p><p> Stage coaches ran to most of the towns; and we may judge of the time they took over their journeys, Gloucester,
82 miles, in one day, and Hereford, 134 miles, in one day and a half. Their fares may be somewhat approximately guessed at: Bath, 16s.; Bristol, 15s. to 18s. ; and Gosport, 9s. Steele gives an amusing description in the Spectator (No. 132) of stage-coach travelling: how the captain was subdued by the good plain sense of Ephraim the Quaker. 'We can not help it, Friend, I say; if thou wilt, we must hear thee.... To speak indiscreetly what we are obliged to hear, by being hasped up with thee in this publick Vehicle is in some degree assaulting on the high road.' The captain took the rebuke in good part, and thorough good-fellowship prevailed. ' Faith, Friend, I thank thee: I should have been a little impertinent if thou hadst not reprimanded me.'
  </p><p> In 'A Step to the Bath' we get an insight into stagecoach travelling. 'Enquiring of the Tapster what Company I was like to have, he said more he believ'd than I desir'd; for there was four Places taken just after I went, and three of the Passengers were in the House, and to Lye there that Night; the other was for a Merchant of Bristol. Then asking what those in the House were, he told me two Gentlewomen and their Maid Servant, who were just going to Supper. Whereupon I bid him go and give my Service to
'em, and tell 'em I was to Travel with 'em to morrow, and should take it as a great favour, if they would please to Honour me so far, as to admit me of their Company, for I was alone. The Fellow brought word they desir'd me to walk in, and they should be very glad of mine.... Supper being ended, they call'd for a Bill, which was presently brought; out I lugg'd and was going to Discharge, but they begg'd my Pardon, and would by no means suffer me; telling me that I must submit to the Rule that is generally observ'd in Travelling, for the Major of either Sex to Treat the Minor.'
  </p><p> They breakfasted at Colebrook, dined at Reading, and then drained the merchant's bottle of 'Right Nants'; after

<pb n="168" id="p.168"/>
 which one of the ladies told a story. They stopped at Theale to taste Old Mother Cleanly's bottled ale and plum cake; then the merchant told a story; and the day's journey terminated at Newbury.  There they supped, and grumbled loudly at the bill. 'For a brace of Midling Trouts they charged us but a Leash of Crowns, Six Shillings for a Shoulder of Mutton and a Plate of Gerkins, Three and Sixpence for Six Rowles, and three Nipperkins of Belch; and two Shillings more for Whip in drinking our. Healths. Their Wine indeed was good, so was their price; and in a Bill of two pound four Shillings, they made a mistake but of Nine; I ask'd what Countrey-man my Landlord was? answer was made, Full North; and Faith 'twas very Evident, for he had put the Yorkshire most damnably upon us.'
   </p><p>Next morning one of the ladies presented them with a pot of chocolate of her own preparing; they refilled the merchant's bottle, and started, beguiling the way with stories. Came to Marlborough, where the road was so bad that the brandy bottle was broken; and there they breakfasted. They seem to have dined at Calne or Chippenham, complaining bitterly of the roads, the last portion of which was got over at the rate of two miles in three hours. Here they stopped at a famous house, where 'there was more Coaches and Waggons drawn up before her Gate, than Hacks in Palace Yard, during the Session of Parliament, or Term Time. All her Entertainment is Loins of Mutton or Rabbits; and she makes more Broth in a day than all the Chop Houses in Castle Alley in a Week.'
  </p><p> 'Having Din'd, we proceeded on our Journey, but with a great deal of difficulty; for the Road was so Rocky, Unlevel, and Narrow in some places, that I am persuaded the Alps are to be passed with less Danger,' and they finally reached Bath that evening.
  </p><p> The roads were bad almost everywhere, and no one travelled more than they could help.  The coaches were heavy and strong, to stand the fearful wear and tear; but, to the passengers, a journey was simply the time spent in torture. Even in London the stones jolted terribly.  Says Ward 'When our Stratford Tub by the assistance of its


<pb n="169" id="p.169"/>
 Carrionly Tits of different Colours, had outrun the Smoothness of the Road, and enter'd upon London stones, with as frightful a rumbling as an empty Hay Cart, our Leathern Conveniency being bound in the Braces to its good Behaviour, had no more Sway than a Funeral Herse, or a Country Waggon; That we were jumbled about like so many Pease in a Child's Rattle, running at every Kennel Jolt a great hazard of a Dislocation: This we endured till we were brought within White Chappel Bars, where we lighted from our stubborn Caravan with our Elbows and Shoulders as Black and Blew as a Rural Man that has been under the pinches of an angry Fairy.'
   </p><p> Posthouses were at convenient stages all over the kingdom, and the postmaster was bound to provide horses for all comers, either to ride or drive.  His duties and tariffs were as follows:-
   </p><p> 'The Post Master is obliged to receive of every Person, Riding Post with Horses and Guide, thus 3d. per Mile for each Horse Hire and 4d. per Stage for a Guide.
   </p><p> 'And no Person carrying a Bundle that doth not exceed
80 lbs. Averdupoise, shall be charged for it.
   </p><p> 'If through the default of the Post Master, any Person Riding Post shall fail of being furnished, he shall forfeit 5&#x00A3;. Or if the Post Master cannot, or do not furnish any Person with Horses for Riding Post, then they are at Liberty to provide Horses for themselves; but no Horses to be seized without the Owner's Consent.
  </p><p> 'The other way that Gentlemen commonly Travel is in Stage Coaches, which is from about 2d. Farthing to 3d. per Mile. The Flying Coach is a Stage Coach, that is drawn by 6 Horses, and will sometimes run 90 or 100 English Miles on one day.
   </p><p>'It may also be noted that Carriage by Waggon or Pack Horses, is about 5 Shillings for carrying 112 Pound Weight
100 Miles; and so in proportion; though 'tis something cheaper in the Summer than Winter.'  <note place="foot" n="1">British Curiosities in Nature and Art, <date value="1713">1713</date>.</note>
   </p><p>The hackney coach was a very useful institution, in spite of all said against it. We have read Ward's description of the bumping he had in one; in another part of the London


<pb n="170" id="p.170"/>
 Spy he says: 'Would you have me, said I, undergo the Punishment of a Coach again, when you Know I was so great a Sufferer by the last, that it made my Bones rattle in my Skin, and has brought as many Pains about me, as if troubled with the Rheumatism. That was a Country Coach, says he, and only fit for the Road; but London Coaches are hung more loose, to prevent your being Jolted by the roughness of the pavement.'
  </p><p> The ordinary hackney coaches do not seem to have been provided with glasses. 'For want of Glasses to our Coach, having drawn up our Tin Sashes, pink'd like the bottom of a
<figure id="fig.00019" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.006.DO01.00019"><head>Hackney Coach</head> </figure> Cullender, that the Air might pass thro' the holes, and defend us from Stifling.'
  </p><p> By the 5 &#x0026; 6 Will. and Mary, cap. 22, the number of hackney coaches was fixed at 700, and a tax was imposed of
4&#x00A3;. per annum each, 1&#x00A3;. to be paid every quarter day, besides a fine of 50&#x00A3;. for their first licence for 21 years; and 8&#x00A3;. per annum on stage coaches.
  </p><p> To look after these hackney carriages there were five commissioners, at a salary each of 200&#x00A3;., and their office was in Surrey Street, Strand. The fares were not very heavy, even taking the difference of the value of money into consideration, and the fact that they had two horses.

   And, if any Coachman shall refuse to go at, or exact more, for Hire,
     than the Rates hereby limited, he shall for every such Offence
     forfeit 40 Shillings.
 </p><p>  In <date value="1710">1710</date> the number of coaches was increased to 800 by the 9 Anne, cap. 23, which also provided that they were to pay five shillings weekly, and were to go a mile and a half for one shilling, two miles for one shilling and sixpence, above two miles two shillings, and greater distances in the same proportion.
  </p><p> The hackney coachmen petitioned against the tax, and said they were willing to pay the old one. One petition was entitled 'Some Reasons most humbly Offered to the Consideration of the Right Honourable the House of LORDS and the Honourable the House of Commons; by all the 700 Hackney Coachmen and their Widows to Enable them to pay the Great Tax laid upon them;' and another was 'The Hackney Coachmen's case. Humbly presented to the Right Honourable House of Commons with a proposal to raise for her Majesty 200,000&#x00A3;. per annum.' This was proposed, very coolly, to be done by laying a tax on all coaches and carriages not licensed, on passengers going by stage coaches, and on goods carried by waggons and packhorses.
  </p><p> The coaches were numbered, although I can only find one notice of it: 'So that, rather than to stand a Vapulation, one of them took Notice of his Number;'  <note place="foot" n="2"> London Spy.</note> and the coachmen were noted for their incivility. Of course they did not come from a very high class, and the habits and language of the lower class of that time were extremely coarse. 'We discharged our Grumbling Coachman, who Mutter'd heavily, according to their old Custome, for t'other Sixpence; till at last moving us a little beyond our Patience, we gave an Angry Positive Denial to his Unreasonable Importunities; for we found, like the rest of his Fraternity, he had taken up the Miserly Immoral rule, viz. Never to be Satisfied.'

<pb n="172" id="p.172"/>

  </p><p> Gay gently hints at their incivility :-
       <quote rend="blockquote">   <l>If Wheels bar up the Road, where Streets are Crost,

  </p><p> State coaches were very handsome, being elaborately painted, carved,

    </p><p>  But even in that age of luxuriously appointed equipages
      everyone was astonished at the magnificence of that of the

<pb n="173" id="p.173"/>
 Venetian ambassador. Luttrell notes it on May 20, <date value="1707">1707</date>:
'Yesterday the Venetian ambassadors made their publick entry thro' this citty to Somerset House in great state and splendour, their Coach of State embroidered with gold, and the richest that ever was seen in England: they had two with
8 horses, and eight with 6 horses, trimm'd very fine with ribbons, 48 footmen in blew velvet cover'd with gold lace, 24 gentlemen and pages on horseback, with feathers in their hats.' And the novelty does not seem to have worn off, for, four years afterwards, Swift writes to Stella: 'This evening I saw the Venetian Ambassador coming from his first public audience. His coach is the most monstrous, huge, fine, rich, gilt thing that ever I saw.' He also writes her, Feb. 6, <date value="1712">1712</date>:
'Nothing has made so great a noise as one Kelson's Chariot, that cost nine hundred and thirty Pounds, the finest was ever seen. The rabble huzzaed him as much as they did Prince Eugene.'
   </p><p> Anybody with any pretension to wealth and fashion drove
 six horses, as says Mrs. Plotwell  <note place="foot" n="3">The Beau's Duel, Mrs. Centlivre. </note> : 'I must have Six Horses
 in my Coach, four are fit for those that have a Charge of
 Children, you and I shall never have any;' and Lucinda tells
 Sir Toby Doubtful <note place="foot" n="2 ">Love's Contrivance, Mrs. Centlivre.</note>: 'You'll at least keep Six Horses Sir
 Toby, for I wou'd not make a Tour in High Park with less for
 the World; for me thinks a pair looks like a Hackney.' The
 coachman, however, did not drive all six, one of the leaders
 being always ridden by a postilion. These carriage horses
 were heavy, long-tailed Flemish ones, and naturally went at
 a sedate and sober trot.
    </p><p> It was not everyone that could afford six, or even four,
 horses, so there were lighter vehicles, as the chariot, the
 calash, and the chaize or chaise. The latter was adapted for
 one or two horses, and sometimes was highly ornamented.
 'A very fine CHAIZE, very well Carved, gilded and painted,
 and lined with blue Velvet, and a very good HORSE for it,
 are to be sold together, or apart &#x0026;c.-The Horse is also a
 very good HORSE for the Saddle.'
    </p><p> 'A very fine pair of young Stone Horses, and a very neat
 Chaize, well Carved, gilt and painted, and lined with Scarlet,

<pb n="174" id="p.174"/>
 and but little the worse for useing to be sold.' 'A Curious 4 Wheel Shaze, Crane Neck'd, little the worse for wearing, it is to be used with one or 2 Horses, and there is a fine Harness for one Horse, and a Reputable Sumpture Laopard Covering.'
   </p><p>The ordinary chaises, however, were much plainer, and they were built strongly, to stand the strain of bad pavements and roads; but it is probable that very few were put to such a severe test as the following: ' At the Greyhound Inn in West Smithfield is to be sold a Two Wheel Chaise, with a Pair of Horses well match'd: It has run over a Bank and a Ditch 5 Foot High; and likewise through a deep Pit within the Ring at Hide Park, in the presence of several Persons of Quality; which are very satisfied it cannot be overturn'd with fair Driving. It is to be Lett for 7s. 6d. a Day, with some Abatement for a longer Time.'
  </p><p> There should be a history attaching to the following advertisement: 'Whereas, upon the 10th of Octob. last, a Gentleman brought a Calash and one Horse, to the Duke of Grafton's Head at Hide Park Corner, and on the 20th of the same Month fetched away the Horse, but left the Calash as a pawn for what was due for the same. If the Owner will come and pay what is due, he may have his Calash again, else it will be appraised and sold in 10 days time.' The innkeeper had waited six months before he advertised.
  </p><p> Here is another curious advertisement connected with coaches. 'Lost the 26th of February, about 9 a Clock at Night, between the Angel and Crown Tavern in Threadneedle Street, and the end of Bucklers Berry, the side Door of a Chariot, Painted Coffee Colour, with a Round Cypher in the Pannel, Lin'd with White Cloath embos'd with Red, having a Glass in one Frame, and White Canvas in another, with Red Strings to both Frames. Whosoever hath taken it up are desir'd to bring it to Mr. Jacob's a Coachmaker at the corner of St. Mary Ax near London Wall, where they shall receive 30s. Reward if all be brought with it; or if offer'd to be Pawn'd or Sold, desire it may be stop'd and notice given, or if already Pawn'd or Sold, their money again.'
  </p><p> In very many advertisements of the sale of second-hand carriages, it is mentioned that the glasses are complete. One


<pb n="175" id="p.175"/>
 would imagine from this that glass was dear, but it was not particularly so. 'These are to give notice to all Persons that have occasions for Coach Glasses, or Glasses for Sash Windows, that they may be furnished with all sorts, at half the prises they were formerly sold for.' And it goes on to say that 12 inches square was 2s. 6d., and increased up to 22 inches, nearly at the rate of 6d. per inch, or 8s. 6d.; 23 inches was 10s. 6d., and so on at about 2s. 6d. per inch to 28 inches, which was 20s., until it culminated at 36 inches square for
&#x00A3; 2 10s. If this, really, was half the previous cost, and if we reckon the difference in the value of money then and now perhaps some economical people would think twice before having a broken glass repaired.
   </p><p>There were also a 'Chasse maree Coach,' and a 'Curtin Coach for Six People.'
   </p><p>They used to take nice little drives, too, in these clumsy old carriages-but they took their time over the journey. Thoresby's 'kind friend Mr. Boulter, brought his chariot from Chelsea, purposely to carry him to see Hampton Court.' They started about eleven, and, 'having passed through the City, we passed the Gravel Pits,1 and had a clear air (whither the Consumptive are sent by the physicians) and delicate pleasant Country to Acton and Brentford; the Duke of Somerset's Seat at Sion House looked most charmingly, and was the first time I had observed the lime trees in the avenues cut in a pyramidal form, even to a great distance from the palace, which looked very Noble; thence through Thistleworth and Twitnam, a very pleasant road.' After their visit to Hampton, they stopped for the night at Richmond Wells, returning next day via Kew, Mortlake, Putney, and Wandsworth.
   </p><p> His friend Boulter, on another occasion, 'took me in his Coach to Hampstead, where we dined with his mother; and after viewing that pleasant town, and taking a view of the Country from the Hill beyond it, we took a tour to Highgate, Mussel Hill and other Country villages, and a pleasant Country, and returned by Islington and Newington home again.'

     </p><p>There was a mechanical curiosity which appeared in <date value="1711">1711</date>
 and of which the following is an advertisement. 'An Invention of a wonderful Chariot, in which Persons may travel
 several Miles an Hour, without the assistance of Horses, and
 Measure the Miles as they go; it turns or goes back; having
 the Praise of all Persons of Quality, and ingenious Men that
 have seen it. Note that it is convenient for any Gentleman
 that is incapable of walking thro' lameness, to ride about
 his Park or Garden, without damaging his Tarris-Walks or
 Grass-Plats. The Invention is so highly approv'd that there
 is one already bespoke by a Person of Quality, which is to go
 on four Wheels, and swing in the Nature of a large Coach;
 which according to a modest Computation, will travel at the
 Rate of 7 or 8 Miles an Hour. If any Person of Quality is
 desirous to use them with Horses, they may either travel as
 far again in a Day as they can with another Coach, or can
 go as far with a Pair of Horses, as the Coaches hitherto in
 Use can with 6. Note that such as are bespoke for Parks
 or Gardens only, will come very reasonable, others at proportionable Prices.'
   </p><p> It was the fashion to use a mourning coach all the time mourning was worn, and this rendered it incumbent upon people to possess such a vehicle: consequently they were frequently advertised for sale-'At Mr. Harrison's, Coach Maker, in the Broadway, Westminster, is a Mourning Coach and Harness, never used, with a whole Fore Glass, and two Door Glasses, and all other Materials (the Person being deceased); also a Mourning Chariot, being little used, with all Materials likewise, and a Leather Body Coach, being very fashionable with a Coafoay Lining and 4 Glasses, and several sorts of Shazesses, at very reasonable Rates.'
  </p><p> The reins were not of leather, but of worsted, and sometimes of gay colours. Pepys, on that memorable May Day in <date value="1669">1669</date> when he started his pretty gilt coach, and had the horses' manes and tails tied with red ribbons, had 'green reins, that people did mightily look upon us.'  French harness seems to have been most fashionable, although there is 'a pair of fine new Rumpee Town Harness' advertised; and hammer-cloths were used on the coach-boxes.     A

<pb n="177" id="p.177"/>
 singular industry sprang up-that of stealing these hammercloths. 'Lost off a Gentleman's Coach Box a Crimson Coffoy Hammer Cloth, with 2 yellow Laces about it.' ' Lost off a Gentleman's Coach Box, a Blue Hammer Cloth, trimm'd with a Gold colour'd Lace that is almost turn'd yellow.' 'Lost a Red Shag Hammock Cloth, with white Silk Lace round it, embroider'd with white and blue, and 3 Bulls Heads and a Squirrel for the Coat of Arms.'
  </p><p> The sedan chair was a conveyance that was getting into vogue in Anne's reign. Taking its name from the town of Sedan in France, it was first used in England in <date value="1581">1581</date>, and in London in <date value="1623">1623</date>.
   </p><p>In <date value="1711">1711</date> an Act (9 Anne, c. 23) was passed licensing 200
<figure id="fig.00021" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.006.DO01.00021"><head>A Sedan Chair</head> </figure> public sedan chairs at ten shillings each yearly, and their fare was settled at 1s. per mile. Next year, another Act (10 Anne, c. 19) was passed, licensing 100 more, but keeping the fares unaltered.
   </p><p>Like coaches, their adornment was indicative of the wealth and position of their owners-although, perhaps, none ever came up to Anne's royal present.' 'The Queen has made a present of a chair value 8000&#x00A3;<note place="foot" n="4"> Luttrell's Diary, Dec. 10, <date value="1709">1709</date>.</note> to the King of Prussia, which is ordered for Berlin.' Still they were highly ornamental, as the following, which was the property of Sir Joseph Williamson, deceased, will show. 'A Cedan (or


<pb n="178" id="p.178"/>
 Chair) lin'd with Crimson Velvet, trim'd with Gold and Silver, and a new Mourning Chair &#x0026;c.'
   </p><p> The prefix 'Sedan' was seldom    used, and these conveyances were generally termed 'Chairs.' That they were considered somewhat of a novelty in Anne's reign is evidenced by that line of Gay's, 'Nor late invented Chairs perplex'd the way,' and also by the fact that then the public chairs were first licensed, and the number, a very small one, regulated.
    </p><p>They were not particularly comfortable, as the Marquis of Hazard describes <note place="foot" n="5">The Gamester.</note>: 'Hey, let my three Footmen wait with my Chair there-the Rascals have come such a high trot-they've jolted me worse than a Hackney Coach-and I am in as much disorder as if I had not been drest to day.' And they were sometimes dangerous too.

<p> IN every age and country young blood is hot blood, and in this reign it was particularly so. The wild blood of the Cavaliers still danced in the veins of the beaus in Anne's time, and nightly frolics and broils were of frequent occurrence. They had their predecessors in this work-as Sir Tope says in Shadwell's play of 'The Scowrers': ' Puh, this is nothing, why I knew the Hectors, and before them the Muns and the Titire Tus, they were brave fellows indeed; in those days a man could not go from the Rose Tavern to the Piazza once, but he must venture his life twice.' And Whackum, in the same play, describes the doings of the fraternity of Scourers. 'Then how we Scour'd the Market People, overthrew the Butter Women, defeated the Pippin Merchants, wip'd out the Milk Scores, pull'd off the Door Knockers, dawb'd the Gilt Signs.'
  </p><p> In Anne's reign these roysterers were called Mohockswhy, I know not, except that it was then a sort of generic term for North American Indians. In a later age this furore was termed Tom and Jerryism ; but then it had an intelligible origin, from Pierce Egan's 'Life in London, or the Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn Esq. and his elegant Friend Corinthian Tom &#x0026;c.' It still exists, although it has no special name.
  </p><p> Brown, in his ' Letters from the Dead to the Living,' says


<pb n="180" id="p.180"/>
 in that 'From Bully Dawson  <note place="foot" n="1">Bully Dawson is supposed to be the original of Captain Hackum in Shadwell's play of ' The Squire of Alsatia,' and is mentioned by Steele in No. 2 of the Spectator, when he speaks of Sir Roger de Coverley having 'kick'd Bully Dawson in a publick Coffee House for calling him Youngster.'</note> to Bully W  . . . . n
'Therefore if ever you intend to be my Rival in Glory, you must fight a Bailiff once a Day, stand Kick and Cuff once a Week, Challenge some Coward or other once a Month, Bilk your Lodgings once a quarter, and Cheat a Taylor once a year, crow over every Coxcomb you meet with, and be sure you kick every jilt you bully into submission and a compliance of treating you ; never till then will the fame of W  .... n ring like Dawson's in every Coffee House, or be the merry subject of every Tavern Tittle Tattle.'
 </p><p> There seem to have been two special outbreaks of Mohocks-one in <date value="1709">1709</date>, and the other in <date value="1712">1712</date>. Of the first Steele says <note place="foot" n="2">Tatler, 77.</note>: ' When I was a middle-aged Man, there were many societies of Ambitious young men in England, who, in their pursuits after same, were every night employed in roasting Porters, smoaking Coblers, knocking down Watchmen, overturning Constables, breaking Windows, blackening Sign Posts, and the like immortal enterprizes, that dispersed their Reputation throughout the whole Kingdom. One could hardly find a knocker at a door in a whole street after a midnight expedition of these Beaux Esprits. I was lately very much surprised by an account of my Maid, who entered my bed chamber this morning in a very great fright, and told me, she was afraid my parlour was haunted; for that she had found several panes of my Windows broken, and the floor strewed with half-pence. I have not yet a full light into this new way, but am apt to think, that it is a generous piece of wit, that some of my Contemporaries make use of, to break windows, and leave money to pay for them.'
  </p><p> Gay notices the Mohocks, and their window-breaking, thus:-
        <quote rend="blockquote"><l> Now is the Time that Rakes their Revells keep;
        </l><l> Kindlers of Riot, Enemies of Sleep.

 </p><p>  The greatest scare, however, was in March <date value="1712">1712</date>, and that exercised the popular mind as much as the garotters of modern times. People, of course, were more frightened than hurt, and there is very little doubt but that this outbreak was much exaggerated. Still, we can only take the contemporary accounts, and this is one of them.
  </p><p>  <note place="foot" n="3">Brit. Mus. 816m.19/74.</note> THE TOWN RAKES, or the Frolicks of the Mohocks or Hawkubites. With an Account of their Frolicks last night, and at several other Times: shewing how they slit the Noses of several Men and Women, and wounded others; Several of which were taken up last Night by the Guards, and committed to several Prisons, the Guards being drawn out to disperse them.
  </p><p> ' There are a certain set of Persons, amongst whom there are some of too great a Character, to be nam'd in these barbarous and ridiculous Encounters, did they not expose themselves by such mean and vulgar Exploits.
  </p><p> 'These Barbarities have been carry'd on by a Gang of
'em for a considerable time, and many innocent Persons have receiv'd great Injury from them, who call themselves Hawkubites; and their mischievous Invention of the Word is, that they take people betwixt Hawk and Buzzard, that is, betwixt two of them, and making them turn from one to the other, abuse them with Blows and other Scoffings; and, if they pretend to speak for themselves, they then Slit their Noses, or cut them down the Back.
   </p><p> 'The Watch in most of the Out-parts of the town stand in awe of them, because they always come in a body, and are


<pb n="182" id="p.182"/>
 too strong for them, and when any Watchman presumes to demand where they are going, they generally misuse them.
  </p><p> 'Last Night they had a general Rendezvouz, and were bent upon Mischief; their way is to meet People in the Streets and Stop them, and begin to Banter them, and if they make any Answer, they lay on them with Sticks, and toss them from one to another in a very rude manner.
   </p><p>'They attacked the Watch in Devereux Court and Essex Street, made them scower; they also slit two Persons' Noses, and cut a Woman in the Arm with a penknife that she is lam'd. They likewise rowled a Woman in a Tub down Snow Hill, that was going to Market, set other Women on their Heads, misusing them in a barbarous manner.
 </p><p>  'They have short Clubs or Batts that have Lead at the End, which will overset a Coach, or turn over a Chair, and Tucks  <note place="foot" n="4">A tuck was a short sword.</note> in their Canes ready for Mischief.
 </p><p>  'One of these Persons supposed to be of the Gang, did formerly slit a Drawer's Nose at Greenwich, and has committed many such Frolicks since. They were so outrageous last Night, that the Guards at White Hall was alarm'd, and a Detachment order'd to Patrole; and 'tis said, the Train Bands will be order'd to do Duty for the future, to prevent these Disorders; several of them were taken up last Night, and put into the Round Houses till order is taken what to do with them.'
  </p><p> The Spectator, whose living was by making the most of any popular subject of the hour, was specially exercised over the Mohocks. 'An outrageous Ambition of doing all possible hurt to their Fellow-Creatures, is the great Cement of their Assembly and the only Qualification required in the Members. In order to exert this Principle in its full Strength and Perfection, they take Care to drink themselves to a pitch that is beyond the Possibility of attending to any Motives of Reason and Humanity; then make a general Sally, and attack all that are so unfortunate as to walk the Streets through which they patrole. Some are knock'd down, others stabb'd, others cut and carbonado'd. To put the Watch to a total Rout, and mortify some of those inoffensive Militia, is reckon'd a Coup

<pb n="183" id="p.183"/>
 d'eclat. The particular Talents by which these Misanthropes are distinguished from one another, consist in the various kinds of Barbarities which they execute upon their Prisoners. Some are celebrated for a happy Dexterity in tipping the Lion upon them; which is perform'd by squeezing the Nose flat to the Face, and boring out the Eyes with their Fingers; Others are called the Dancing Masters, and teach their Scholars to cut Capers by running Swords thro' their Legs; a new Invention, whether originally French I cannot tell; A third sort are the Tumblers, whose office it is to set Women on their Heads, and commit certain Indecencies or rather Barbarities on the Limbs which they expose.' <note place="foot" n="5">Spectator, 324.</note>
   </p><p> Sir Roger de Coverley was even somewhat nervous about them when he went to the play-and 'asked me, in the next place, whether there would not be some danger in coming home late, in case the Mohocks should be Abroad'; and we learn how, finally, the party went to the theatre.  'The Captain, who did not fail to meet me there at the appointed Hour, bid Sir Roger fear nothing, for that he had put on the same Sword which he made use of at the Battle of Steenkirk. Sir Roger's Servants, and among the rest my old Friend, the Butler, had, I found, provided themselves with good Oaken Plants, to attend their Master upon this occasion.'
   </p><p> Swift was in mortal fear of them, and, in his 'History of the Four Last Years of Queen Anne,' declares it was part of a deliberate plan to raise riot, during which Harley might have been assassinated-and accuses Prince Eugene of setting it afloat. He writes Stella-in Letter 43-fragmentary jottings of his feelings during this period of terror. 'Did I tell you of a race of Rakes, called the Mohocks, that play the devil about this town every night, slit peoples noses, and bid them, &#x0026;c. . . . Young Davenant was telling us at Court how he was set upon by the Mohocks, and how they ran his chair through with a Sword. It is not safe being in the streets at Night for them. The Bishop of Salisbury's son is said to be of the gang. They are all Whigs; and a great lady sent to me, to speak to her father and to lord treasurer, to have a care of them, and to be careful likewise of myself;

<pb n="184" id="p.184"/>
 for she heard they had malicious intentions against the Ministers and their friends. ... I walked in the Park this evening, and came home early to avoid the Mohocks. ... Here is the devil and all to do with these Mohocks. Grub Street papers about them fly like lightning, and a list printed of near eighty put into several prisons, and all a lie; and I almost begin to think there is no truth, or very little, in the whole Story. He that abused Davenant was a Drunken gentleman; none of that gang. My man tells me, that one of the lodgers heard in a Coffee House, publicly, that one design of the Mohocks was upon me, if they Could Catch me; and though I believe nothing of it, I forbear walking late, and they have put me to the Charge of some shillings already. ... I came home in a Chair for fear of the Mohocks.... I came afoot but had my Man with me. Lord treasurer advised me not to go in a Chair, because the Mohocks insult Chairs more than they do those on foot. They think there is some mischievous design in those villains. Several of them, lord-treasurer told me, are actually taken up. I heard at dinner, that one of them was killed last night. . . . Lord Winchelsea told me to day at Court, that two of the Mohocks caught a maid of old Lady Winchelsea's at the door of their house in the Park, with a candle, and had just lighted out somebody. They Cut all her face, and beat her without any provocation. . . . I staid till past twelve, and could not get a Coach, and was alone, and was afraid enough of the Mohocks.'
  </p><p> This dreaded association was supposed to be under the orders of a chief or 'Emperor,' who wore a crescent on his forehead, and is so described both in the Spectator and in Gay's very amusing play of 'The Mohocks,' which is a delicious burlesque on the scare. Here is a sample of it. Some of the watch are talking about this dreaded band, and their doings. Says one: ' I met about five or six and thirty of these Mohocks
-by the same token 'twas a very windy Morning-they all had Swords as broad as Butcher's Cleavers, and hack'd and hew'd down all before them-I saw-as I am a Man of credit,in the Neighbourhood-all the Ground covered with Nosesas thick as 'tis with Hail Stones after a Storm.' Says another :
<pb id="p.185" n="185"/> That is nothing to what I have seen-I saw them hook a Man as cleverly as a Fisher Man would a great Fish-and play him up and down from Charing Cross to Temple Barthey cut off his Ears, and eat them up, and then gave him a swinging slash in the Arm-told him bleeding was good for a fright, and so turned him loose.' A third relates his experience: ' Poh! that's nothing at all-I saw them cut off a Fellow's Legs, and, if the poor Man had not run hard for it, they had Cut off his Head into the bargain.' And the fourth tells how 'Poor John Mopstaff's Wife was like to Come to damage by them-for they took her up by the Heels, and turn'd her quite inside out-the poor Woman, they say, will ne'er be good for anything More.'
  </p><p> Gay also wrote another skit on these awful beings. 'An ARGUMENT proving from History, Reason, and Scripture, that the present Mohocks and Hawkubites are the GOG and MAGOG mentioned in the Revelations, and therefore, That this vain and Transitory World will shortly be brought to its final Dissolution.' It is not particularly amusing, being a parody on scriptural prophecy, and it winds up with the following:-
           <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>From Mohocks and from Hawkubites
            </l><l>  Good Lord deliver me,

  </p><p> Public feeling on the matter, however, was so strong, that on March 17, <date value="1712">1712</date>, the Queen issued a Royal Proclamation.
  </p><p> 'Anne, R. The Queen's Most Excellent Majesty being watchful for the Publick Good of Her Loving Subjects, and taking notice of the great and unusual Riots and Barbarities which have lately been committed in the Night time, in the

  </p><p> Can the following advertisement have any possible relation to the midnight orgies of the Mohocks ? Post Boy, Dec. 18/20, <date value="1712">1712</date>: 'Lately found, several Pair of Stockings, some Night Caps, and several Pair of Shooes, with two Brazill Rolling Pins, and some Brass Knockers of Doors.'
   </p><p>Brass knockers evidently were attractive, for in <date value="1714">1714</date> we find a genius advertising ' There is to be Sold at the Sign of the Plow on Fleet Ditch, New Fashion Brass Knockers of all Sizes that cannot be broke off so easily as any that have yet been made. However, this is to Satisfy all Gentlemen and others that do buy any of them, that if any should be broke off, upon their bringing me a Piece of that which I sold, I will give them gratis one as good and as large as they bought.'
  </p><p> The fright soon passed off, for we find Budgell  <note place="foot" n="6">Spectator, 347.</note> writing on April 8, <date value="1712">1712</date>, that some began to doubt 'whether indeed there were ever any such Society of Men. The Terror which


<pb id="p.187" n="187"/>
 spread itself over the whole Nation some Years since, on account of the Irish, is still fresh in most Peoples Memories, tho' it afterwards appeared there was not the least Ground for that general Consternation. The late Panick Fear was, in the Opinion of many deep and penetrating Persons, of the same Nature.' But there is no doubt there was a substratum of reality, mixed with a great deal of exaggeration.

From the time of Dogberry to the institution of the present police they have ever been a laughing-stock. Old, infirm men, badly paid, incumbered with a long staff and a lantern, perambulated the streets under the authority of a constable. Who cared for them ? Certainly not a Mohock. Nay, their very honesty was called in question. 'Two of them like honest fellows, handed me home to my Chambers, without so much

<pb n="188" id="p.188"/>
 as stealing my Hat or picking my pockets which was a Wonder.'

<p>THE senseless custom of duelling was much in vogue in this reign, although perhaps it had not reached to the height it afterwards did. The custom of wearing swords rendered the arbitrament of every dispute liable to be settled by those weapons. A few hasty words and the sword was whipped out, and probably one or other of the combatants had reason to regret his loss of temper. Indeed, to such a pitch had it come, that the Code of Old John Selden, 'The duels or single combat,' printed in <date value="1610">1610</date>, was reprinted in <date value="1711">1711</date> for the benefit of Queen Anne's subjects, as was also Sir William Hope's 'New   Method of Fencing &#x0026;c.'   Fencing-masters naturally advertised. 'Peter Besson a Waldense, born in Piedmont, teaches the use of the Italian Spadroon; and does invite all Gentlemen that are curious in the Sword to see him perform his Exercises at St. Amant's Coffee House by Charing Cross, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, from 10 of the Clock in the Morning till I. He hath been in most Princes Courts of Europe, from  whom   he hath ample Certificates of his great Dexterity and Ability this Way, and in a very short time can make Gentlemen compleat Masters of this sort of Sword.'  There were also the numerous fencing-masters who performed at Hockley in the Hole, who were always available as teachers.
 </p><p>  Steele, who had himself fought his man and run him through the body, did all he could to discountenance the practice; as he says in Tatler 25: 'I shall talk very freely
<pb n="190" id="p.190"/>
 on a Custom which all men wish exploded, though no man has courage enough to resist it.' And not only does he write against it in that number, but also in Nos. 26, 28, 29,
38, and 39.
  </p><p> As a specimen of the hectoring and bullying then in vogue among a certain class, let us take the following extract from Ward  <note place="foot" n="1">London Spy.</note>: 'As we came down Ludgate Hill, a couple of Town Bullies (as I suppose from their Behaviour) met each other, Damn ye, Sir, says one, why did you not meet me Yesterday Morning according to Appointment ? Damn you, Sir, for a Cowardly Pimp, reply'd the other, I was there and waited till I was Wet to the Skin, and you never came at me.
<figure id="fig.00024" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.006.DO01.00024"><head>A Duel</head> </figure> You lie like a Villain, says t'other, I was there, and stay'd the time of a Gentleman; and draw now, and give me Satisfaction like a Man of Honour, or I'll Cut your Ears off. You see, says the Valiant Adversary, I have not my Fighting Sword on, and hope you are a Man of more Honour than to take Advantage of a Gentleman. Then go home and fetch it, says Don Furioso, like a man of Justice, and meet me within an Hour in the King's Bench Walks in the Temple, or the next time I see you, by Jove's Thunderbolts, I will Pink as many Eylet holes in your Skin, as you have Button holes in your Coat; and therefore have a Care how you Trespass


<pb n="191" id="p.191"/>
 upon my Patience. Upon the Reputation of a Gentleman, I will Punctually meet you at your Time, and Place; reply'd the other, and so they Parted.'
  </p><p> Very early in the reign we hear of duels. The Flying Post, Dec. 15/17, <date value="1702">1702</date>, tells us of two. 'On Monday last Col. Fielding, commonly called Handsom Fielding, was dangerously wounded in a Quarrel with one Mr. Gudgeon, a Gentleman, at the Theatre Royal, <placeName key="Drury Lane">Drury Lane</placeName>. ... On Tuesday night last, one Mr. Cusaick, an Irish Gentleman, and Capt Fullwood, quarrelled at the New Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and afterwards fought; Captain Fullwood fell on the Spot, and Mr. Cusaick was dangerously wounded.'
  </p><p> In the same paper for Dec. 22/24, <date value="1702">1702</date>, we read: 'Mr. Fullwood, who fought with Mr. Cusaick last Week in Lincoln's Inn Fields, was very decently buried on Sunday last in the Evening at St. Clement's Danes in the Strand. His Corps was brought from the Hay Market in a Hearse, attended by many Gentlemen of Note, and some of Quality; they had all Favours and Gloves .. . Two Gentlemen of the Guards fought a Duel in the Meuse; one was kill'd upon the Spot, and the other dangerously wounded.'
  </p><p> We find 'handsom Fielding' at it again in <date value="1704">1704</date>. 'On Friday last my Lord de la Ware, and Mr. Fielding one of Her Majesty's Equerries, fought a Duel at Windsor: His Lordship was dangerously wounded.'<note place="foot" n="2">Daily Courant, Sept. 18, <date value="1704">1704</date>.
</note>
  </p><p> There were pet places for these combats, as there were also in the later days of duelling with pistols, when Wimbledon Common, Wormwood Scrubs, and Chalk Farm were fashionable localities. In Anne's time the favourite spots were Lincoln's Inn Fields, or the fields at the back of Montague and Southampton Houses, St. James's Park, and Barn Elms between Putney and Mortlake. '29 May <date value="1705">1705</date>. Saturday last, Mr. Kennet, a young Kentish gentleman of the Temple, was killed in a duel behind Montague House, supposed by one Mr. Medlicot, who made his escape.'<note place="foot" n="3">Luttrell's Diary.</note>
'23 June <date value="1705">1705</date>. A duel was this week fought in St. James's

<pb n="192" id="p.192"/>
 Park between Foot Onslow Esq, and Dr Shadwell: the latter wounded and disarmed.'
   </p><p> It was illegal to fight duels, but the law was seldom acted on. Still, it was put in force when appealed to. '25 Feb
<date value="1703">1703</date>. Upon Notice given, that Sir Stafford Fairborn and admiral Churchill designed to fight a Duel, they were both Confined, to prevent the same.'
 </p><p>  Whilst on this subject, notice of two famous duels fought in this reign must not be omitted-those between Col. Thornhill and Sir Cholmley Dering, and between the Duke of Hamilton and Lord Mohun; because they throw so much light on the then procedure in these matters.
  </p><p> Swift<note place="foot" n="4">Journal to Stella, May 9, <date value="1711">1711</date>.</note> notices the former thus: 'Dr. Freind came this morning to visit Atterbury's lady and children as physician, and persuaded me to go with him to town in his Chariot. He told me he had been an hour before with Sir Cholmley Dering, Charles Dering's nephew, and head of that family in Kent, for which he is Knight of the Shire. He said he left him dying of a pistol Shot quite through the body, by one Mr. Thornhill. They fought at sword and pistol this morning in Tuttle Fields; their pistols so near, that the muzzles touched.  Thornhill discharged first, and Dering having received the shot, discharged his pistol as he was falling, so it went into the Air.'
  </p><p> This duel created an immense sensation at the time, and several accounts of the trial, etc., are preserved. From one of these<note place="foot" n="5">Brit. Mus. E. <date value="1992">1992</date>/4.</note> we will take our facts, premising that the trial took place at the Old Bailey, May 18, <date value="1711">1711</date>. 'The first Evidences were such as related to the quarrel, begun at the Toy at Hampton Court April 27th past, who depos'd that at an Assembly of about Eighteen Gentlemen met there at that Time, a Difference happen'd between the Deceas'd and the Prisoner, upon their struggling and contending with each other, the Wainscoat of the Room broke in, and Mr. Thornhill falling down, had some Teeth struck out by Sir Cholmley Deering's stamping upon him; that upon this, the Company

<pb n="193" id="p.193"/>
 immediately interpos'd to prevent further Mischief; and Sir Cholmley being made sensible of his fault, declar'd himself ready to ask Mr. Thornhill's Pardon which he did not think sufficient for the Injury done him in beating out his Teeth; but upon his requiring further Satisfaction, Sir Cholmley reply'd, He did not know where to find him, which Mr. Thornhill said 'twas a Lie; soon after this the company broke up, and 'twas observ'd that those Two Gentlemen went home in different Coaches.
   </p><p>'It appeared that after this the Deceas'd made overtures of Accommodation.'
   </p><p>At the trial the doctors deposed that Thornhill's injuries were very severe, that he had had fever, and might have died, had he not had an excellent constitution. As soon as he recovered a little, he sent his antagonist the following challenge.
   </p><p>                                     'May the 8th, <date value="1711">1711</date>.
 'Sir, I shall be able to go Abroad to Morrow Morning, and desire you would give me a Meeting with your Sword and Pistols, which I insist on; the Worthy Gentleman my Friend, who brings this, will concert with you for the Time and Place. I think Tuttle Fields will do well, Hide Park will not, this Time of the Year being full of Company.
                     'I am, Your Humble Servant,
                                     'Richard Thornhill.'
</p><p> His servant deposed that on the morning of the 9th of May
' Sir Cholmley came into his Master's dining Room with a Brace of Pistols in his Hands; upon which he inform'd his Master, Sir Cholmley was there; who thereupon came to him, and ask'd Sir Cholmley if he would drink a Dish of Tea, which he refus'd, but drank a Glass of Small beer. Mr. Thornhill having dress'd himself, they went together in a Hackney Coach to Tuttle Fields. Upon their being there, the Evidence depos'd, That they Came up like Two Lions with their Pistols advanc'd, and when within Four Yards of each other, discharg'd so equally together, that it could not well be discover'd who Shot first.'
 </p><p>  Sir Cholmley fell, and the usual scene took place; the


<pb n="194" id="p.194"/>
 quondam friend rushed forward, and regretfully wished to be of service to the dying man. A surgeon was sent for, and before his death Sir Cholmley not only freely forgave his adversary, but admitted that 'this Misfortune was my own Fault, and of my own Seeking.'
  </p><p> For the defence 'Several Persons of Quality and Worth declared as to Mr. Thornhill's Character, That they never knew him to be of a Quarrelsome Disposition; but that on the Contrary, Sir Cholmley Deering was given to be unwarrantably Contentious.'
  </p><p> The judge summed up very clearly, but against the prisoner, pointing out to the jury the difference between manslaughter and murder; but the jury brought in a verdict of manslaughter.
  <figure id="fig.00025" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.006.DO01.00025"><head>Duel Between Duke of Hamilton And Lord Mohun.</head> </figure>

 </p><p> Thornhill did not survive his adversary long. Swift writes Stella, Aug. 21, <date value="1711">1711</date> : 'Thornhill, who killed Sir Cholmley Dering, was murdered by two men on Turnham Green last Monday Night. As they stabbed him, they bid him remember Sir Cholmley Dering. They had quarrelled at Hampton Court, and followed and stabbed him on horseback.'
  </p><p>  His remorse at his killing Dering is commented on by Steele in Spectator 84, under the name of Spinamont.
  </p><p>  The duel between the Duke of Hamilton and Lord Mohun has been frequently described; and, had only the

<pb n="195" id="p.195"/>
 dissolute Mohun have been killed, few would have regretted its having taken place. As it was, the Duke being the leader of the Jacobite faction in Scotland, and Mohun being a violent Whig, the duel was invested with a political colouring; and the Tories, enraged at Hamilton's fall, did not scruple to call it a Whig murder, and denounce Lord Mohun's second, General Macartney, as having unfairly stabbed him; but from all the evidence  <note place="foot" n="6"> Brit. Mus. 515l.2/215.</note> it is impossible to believe it.
   </p><p>The story of the duel is briefly this. The two noblemen were opposing parties in a lawsuit, and on Nov. 13, <date value="1712">1712</date>, met in the chambers of a Master in Chancery, when the Duke remarked of a witness-' There is no truth or justice in him.' Lord Mohun replied,'I know Mr. Whitworth; he is an honest Man, and has as much truth as your Grace.' This, fanned into flame by officious friends, was enough; and on Nov. 15, or two days afterwards, they fought, early in the morning, in Hyde Park; their seconds- Col. Hamilton and General Macartney-also fighting, or, as they expressed it, 'taking their share in the dance.' Lord Mohun fell, dead, and the Duke atop of him, mortally wounded. The seconds left off fighting, and went to the assistance of their principals; and it was then, it was averred, that Gen. Macartney treacherously stabbed the Duke.
  </p><p> Macartney fled; but Col. Hamilton remained, took his trial, and was only found guilty of manslaughter. He accused Macartney of the foul deed, and great was the hue and cry after him. The Duchess was naturally enraged, and offered a reward of 300&#x00A3;. for his apprehension, and the Government offered 500&#x00A3;. more, but he got off safely. When things were quieter, he returned, stood his trial at the Queen's Bench, Colonel Hamilton's testimony was contradicted, and he was acquitted of the murder-but found guilty of manslaughter. The punishment for this, by pleading benefit of clergy, which of course was always done, was reduced to a very minimum, something amounting to the supposed burning of the hand with a barely warm or cold iron--and he was restored to his rank in the army and had a regiment given him.

<p>'COLONEL SOUTHWELL has sold his regiment for <date value="5000">5000</date>&#x00A3;. to Colonel Hansam of the guards ;'  <note place="foot" n="1">Luttrell, June 12, <date value="1708">1708</date>.</note> and doubtless the latter made money by the transaction, for it seems to have been the practice then for the colonel to sell the smaller commissions in his regiment. Hear what Brown says on the subject: <note place="foot" n="2">A Walk round London and Westminster.</note>
'We observ'd there a Colonel and his Agent, upon whom a pretty brisk Youth of about Seventeen attended at three or four Yards distance in the Rear, and made his Honours upon every occasion, we happen'd to place ourselves very near, and immediately express'd himself as follows: "This young Gentleman has a Particular Regard to your Honour, and a desire to learn the Art of War under so experienc'd an Officer;
'tis true, he can't boast of any Antiquity of Blood or Service in the Army, to recommend him to so considerable a Post, as that of Ensign to your Honour. But, Sir, he has deposited a Hundred Guineas in the hands of Sir Francis Child, which, I presume, will plead his Merit very weightily; besides an Acknowledgement to your humble Servant." The Favour was granted, and the young Beau dismiss'd to his satisfaction.'
  </p><p> This is not an exaggeration; the thing was openly talked about, and even advertised. 'This is to give Notice, That


<pb n="197" id="p.197"/>
 Whosoever has a Mind to treat about the purchasing Commissions in the Army, either in old Regiments, or others, let them apply themselves to Mr. Pyne at his Coffee House under Scotland Yard Gate, near Whitehall, and they will be further inform'd about it.'
  </p><p> This advertisement seems to have aroused the authorities, for in the Gazette of Oct. 23/25, <date value="1711">1711</date>, is the following official notice: 'Whereas a scandalous Advertisement has been twice published in the Post Boy, giving Notice, That whoever has a mind to treat about the Purchasing Commissions in the Army, either in the old Regiments or others, might apply to Mr. Pyne, at his Coffee house under Scotland Yard Gate near Whitehall, and they should be further inform'd about it; which being directly contrary to Her Majesty's express Will and pleasure, sometime declar'd and signify'd, as well at home, as to all her Generals abroad, against the Sale of Commissions upon any account whatsoever; it is thought fit to give this publick Notice, to prevent any abuses or Impositions that might happen therefrom; and whoever shall discover to Her Majesty's Secretary at War, at his Office in Whitehall, the Authors of the said Advertisement, shall have due Protection and Encouragement.'
   </p><p>A colonel clothed his regiment too, and there must have been money made out of that: and a military conversation recorded by Brown throws much light on the manners of the army at that time. 'We had pass'd the Horse Guards and enter'd the oderiferous Park of St. James's, we found it a High Change on the Parade, Red Coats and Laced Hats spread everywhere. . . Here is decided the Price of Commissions, which are openly bought and sold, as if a lawful Merchandize . . . Here you may hear all this General's Miscarriages fully accounted for; that General's success magnify'd and describ'd; that Colonel damn'd for being put over this Captain's Head; that Agent curs'd for tricking the Regiment out of their Pay, or by raising such Contributions with the Colonel's Connivance, that Estates are now got at this end of the Town, as well as by Stock Jobbing in the City. Here honest Pain, and Potter, and divers others of that fraternity, take their mid-day's Perambulation, to Agree with
<pb n="198" id="p.198"/>
 Spendthrift Officers, for advancing their Money at 30 per Cent.'
  </p><p> The pay of all ranks in the army was always in arrear and hard to be got at, so these agents had a fine time of it.

   </p><p> In Bickerstaff's 'Lottery for the London Ladies,' another class of officer is spoken of. 'Young spruce Beauish non fighting Officers, often to be seen at Man's Coffee House, Loaded with more Gold Lace than ever was worn by a

 thriving Hostess upon her Red Petticoat, all Ladies Sons of a fine Barbary Shape, Dance admirably, Sing charmingly, speak French fluently, and are the Darlings of their Mothers; have large Pay for little Service, are kept at home by the Interest of their Friends, to oblige the Ladies, and hate the thought of going on Board Ships, because their nice Noses are unable to endure the smell of Tar, or the stink of Belg Water; besides they are as much afraid of dawbing their Cloaths as they are of ventering their Carcases.'
 </p><p>  Who can this be ? 'The first Gentleman I happen'd to cast my Eyes upon, was my old Friend and Fellow Collegian Bartholomew Cringe. I wonder'd who in the Devil's Name had equipt him with a Wig large enough to load a Camel
. . . His Sword in length resembled a Footman's, who asserts the Reputation of his Mistriss, which, for divers good Causes and Reasons, he is very nearly Concern'd in. His Coat was as blue as the Sky; and his Hat boldly erected its Sable Penthouse, to play with greater vivacity the ruddy Complexion of its Owner. . . . Says he, Dear friend Tom, you're surpriz'd to find your old Friend in this Place and Habit. I wear this Dress and Garniture as the Emblems of my Militant Capacity. I have the Honour to perform the Duties of my Office under the Protection of that worthy Gentleman Lieutenant General -- in Quality of Chaplain to his Regiment.'  <note place="foot" n="6"> A Walk round London and Westminster.</note>
  </p><p> Even their commissions were the subject of traffic. 'If any Gentleman that is Chaplain to a Regiment is willing to dispose of his Commission, he is desired to acquaint therewith the Master of the Tilt Yard Coffee House near Whitehall.'
 </p><p>  What were the rank and file of this period ? Hear a contemporary opinion. <note place="foot" n="7">The London Spy.</note> 'A Foot Soldier is commonly a Man, who for the sake of wearing a Sword, and the Honour of being term'd a Gentleman, is coax'd from a Handicraft Trade, whereby he might Live comfortably, to bear Arms for his King and Country, whereby he has the hopes of nothing but to Live Starvingly. His Lodging is as near Heaven as his Quarters can raise him; and his Soul generally is as near Hell as a Profligate Life can sink him. To speak without


<pb n="200" id="p.200"/> Swearing, he thinks a Scandal to his Post; and makes many a Meal upon Tobacco, which keeps the inside of his Carcase as Nasty as his Shirt. He's a Champion for the Church, because he Fights for Religion, tho' he never hears Prayers except they be Read upon a Drum Head. He often leads a Sober Life against his Will; but he never can pass by a Brandy shop with 2d. in his Pocket, for he as Naturally loves Strong Waters as a Turk loves Coffee. . . . He is a Man of Undaunted Courage; and dreads no Enemies so much as he does the Wooden Horse, which makes him hate to be mounted; and rather chuses to be a Foot Soldier. He's a Man, that when upon guard, always keeps his word, and obeys his Officer as Indians do the Devil, not thro' Love but Fear;
. . . When once he has been in a Battle it's a hard matter to get him out of it; for where ever he comes he's always talking of the Action, in which he was posted in the greatest danger; and seems to know more of the matter than the General. Scars, tho' got in Drunken Quarrels, he makes Badges of his Bravery; and tells you they were Wounds receiv'd in some Engagement, tho' perhaps given him for his Sawciness. He's one that loves Fighting no more than other Men; tho' perhaps a dozen of Drink and an affront, will make him draw his Sword; yet a Pint, and a good Word, will make him put it up again. Let him be in never so many Campaigns in Flanders he contracts but few Habits of a Dutchman, for you shall oftener see him with his Fingers in his Neck than his Hands in his Pockets. He has the Pleasure once a Week, when he receives his Subsistence, of boasting he has Money in his Breeches; and for all he is a Soldier owes no Man a Groat, which is likely enough to be true, because no Body will trust him. Hunger and Lousiness are the two Distempers that Afflict him ; and Idleness and Scratching the two Medicines that Palliate his Miseries. If he spends Twenty years in Wars, and lives to be Forty, perhaps he may get a Halbert; and if he Survives Three Score, an Hospital. The best end he can expect to make, is to Die in the Bed of Honour; and the greatest Living Marks of his Bravery, to recommend him at once to the World's Praise and Pity, are Crippled Limbs, with which I shall leave him to beg a better Lively Hood.'

True, they were promised that' if any Able bodied Men are willing to serve Her MAjesty in the Train of Artillery abroad, let them report to Captain Silver, Master Gunner of England, at his House in St. Jame's Park, they shall enter into present Pay of Seven Shillings a Week, and be further encouraged and advanced as they shall deserve'.
 </p><p>  Did they get this pay regularly? I fear not always.  Ward speaks of 'that unfortunate Wretch,  who in time of War hazards his Life for Six pence a day, and that perhaps

<pb n="202" id="p.202"/> ne'er paid him ;' and there is an ominous advertisement,1
'The Paymaster General of Her Majesty's Guards, Garrisons
&#x0026;c. in Great Britain, has given Notice, That Money is issued for the Subsistance of the Troops and Regiments under his Care, to the 24th instant, inclusive.' If it were the usual practice to have the money in hand, there would have been no necessity for advertising it in this case. Discipline seems to have been rather lax just then, for in the Gazette, Oct. I I / 14, <date value="1712">1712</date>, there is a notice: ' Her Majesty is pleased to order, that all the Officers of the Regiments of Harvey, Peppar, Harrison, Wade, Bowles, Dormer, and Windress, do forthwith repair to the Castle of Dublin, and there receive such Orders as shall be given them by the Lords Justices of that Kingdom, upon pain of being checked of their Pay.' The uniforms in the army were plain and serviceable; the most picturesque being that of the Grenadiers, who, Evelyn says, were first introduced in <date value="1678">1678</date>. Some idea of the food given to the soldiers in garrison, may be gained by perusal of the following contract for rations.2
'The Most Honourable the Lord High Treasurer of Great Britain having receiv'd Her Majesty's Pleasure, That a Contract shall be made for Victualling Her Majesty's Garrisons at Minorca, to consist of about <date value="4000">4000</date> Men, and at Gibraltar, to consist of about <date value="2000">2000</date> Men, according to the Proportions underwritten for each Man for Seven Days, viz.

<pb n="203" id="p.203"/> his sergeant and drummer, would be quartered in some country town, and 'beat up for recruits.' Of a recruiting officer we get some notion in Spectator 132, and in Farquhar's play. Let Sergeant Kite himself tell us the qualifications for a recruiting sergeant. 'So that if your Worship pleases to cast up the whole Sum, viz. Canting, Lying, Impudence, Pimping, Bullying, Swearing, Drinking, and a Halbard, you will find the Sum Total amount to a Recruiting Sergeant.' The Queen's shilling once being taken, or even sworn to have been taken, and attestation made, there was no help for the recruit, unless he was bought out. In <date value="1703">1703</date> these means seem to have failed, for men could not be got in sufficient quantities without the inducement of a bounty. 'This is to give Notice, That his Grace the Duke of Schombergh is raising a Regiment of Dragoons for Her Majesty's Service; all such Persons who shall have a mind to List themselves therein, may repair either to his Grace's in Pall Mall, or to Mr. Brerewood in Norfolk Street, in the Strand, near Temple Bar, Agent to the same, where such Persons as have been formerly in the Army and are still fit for Dragoons, shall receive 40.s. in hand for Levy Money, besides all fitting Accoutrements, and such as have not been already in the Service shall have 30.s. and Accoutrements.' In <date value="1706">1706</date> an Act was passed (4 &#x0026;  5 Anne, cap. 21) 'For the better recruiting Her Majesty's Army and Marines,' which gave the power to justices, assisted by their subordinates, 'to raise and levy such Able bodied Men as have not any lawful Calling or Imployment or visible Means for their Maintenance and Lively hood to serve as Soldiers.' A volunteer was to have a bounty of 40s. given him, and 'shall not be liable to be taken out of Her Majesty's Service by any Process other than for some Criminal Matter.' This shows to what straits they were reduced for men, and the following exemplifies the class of recruits that were then going into the army: 'Smith, who some time was half hanged  and cut down, having accused about 350 pickpockets, housebreakers, &#x0026;c. who gott to be soldiers in the guards, the better to hide their roguery, were last week

<pb n="204" id="p.204"/> upon mustering the regiments drawn out, and immediately shipt off for Catalonia; and about 60 Women, who lay under condemnation for such Crimes, were likewise sent away to follow the Camp.' The Act of <date value="1706">1706</date> either fell partially in abeyance, or did not fulfil its requirements, for in the Gazette of Jan. 26/29,
<date value="1707">1707</date>-8, is a proclamation by the Queen calling attention to it, and promising, for the better carrying of it out, and 'for the greater Incouragement of all Parish Officers to perform the Duty injoin'd them by that Act, That such Parish Officers, for every Person they should bring before the Magistrate, who should be Impressed should Receive the Sum of Twenty Shillings; and that every Volunteer, for his better Incouragement to come into our Service, and List himself according to the Intention of the said Act, should Receive the sum of Four Pounds, and also that such Volunteer should be Discharg'd after Three Years Service, if he deserved it.' This was the outcome of a fresh Act (7 Anne, cap. 2). Of course these men deserted in shoals, but that they had always done, from the first year of the Queen's reign. The reward offered, by their officers, for their apprehension generally ranged from one to two guineas, and occasionally they were entreated to return, of their own free will, when they would be forgiven.  Once only can I find that a severe example was ever made of them, and that was in <date value="1703">1703</date>.
'6 Dec. This day a Soldier of Colonel Gorsuck's Company, was Shot in Hide Park for Desertion.' Probably they ran the gauntlet, as did that soldier in <date value="1702">1702</date>: 'Yesterday a Soldier ran the Gantlet (as he well deserved) in St. James's Park, for speaking some reflecting words on his late Majesty, and is to run twice more.' In the last year of Anne's reign there were some wicked drummers, whose story is told very graphically in the Post Boy, Feb. 11/13, <date value="1714">1714</date>. 'John Needham, Constable and Beadle of the Ward of Farringdon within, warding at Ludgate the Sixth Instant, (the Queen's Birth Day) by Order of the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen; was sent for to the Crown Tavern on Ludgate Hill, to make a Gentleman Easy, who

<pb n="205" id="p.205"/> was in Drink. The Constable having made him and the rest Friends, the Gentleman would have him to the Queen's Arms Tavern, a little below, where they drank a Glass of Wine together: But the Constable hearing some Drums beat, ran into the Street, with his long Staff in his Hand, and the Gentleman with him, who saw a very great Tumult of disorderly Persons arm'd with huge Clubs, and several with Cleavers &#x0026;c., and innumerable Lights, and Streamers. Among the rest came Three of H-- M--'s Drummers beating their Drums; whereupon the Gentleman ran up to the Drum Head, and ask'd, Who they were for? They said, The House of Hanover. He repli'd G-- D-- you, what before the Queen is dead? Drummers, I'll give you Sixpence, beat a Point of War for Queen ANNE, here by the Constable. But the Constable said, No, let them go into the Tavern, and beat out of the Crowd, and they shall have Money and Wine too. So he made way for them with his Staff, and they went into the Tavern, where they beat and drank till the Tumult was gone by. After which, the Constable had them up to Ludgate, and from thence to the Compter. The next Evening, about Four a Clock, he carry'd them before Sir William Withers, who demanded their Names, and those of their Colonels, which are as follows, Thomas Hawes under Colonel P--tt; Charles Bannister under Colonel E--ll; and William Taylor under Brigadier F--s belonging to the F-- R-- of G--'s. And after Sir William Withers had examin'd them, and the said Constable, and another Constable (whose Hat the Rioters beat off, because he did not pull it off to them, tho' he was on his Duty with his long Staff in his Hand) he was of Opinion their Crime would amount to High Treason, and was so much the blacker, because they were the Q - 's own S  ts, and therefore Committed them to Newgate.' In cases, however, of civil commotion, the train bands were generally called out. These citizen soldiers were ever the laughing-stock of the wits of their day, and Steele cannot help having his joke upon them. '  The Chief Citizens, like the noble Italians, hire Mercenaries to carry arms in their Stead; and you shall have a fellow of desperate fortune, for

<pb n="206" id="p.206"/> the gain of one half Crown, go through all the dangers of Tothill Fields, or the Artillery Ground, clap his right jaw within two inches of the touch-hole of a Musquet, fire it off, and huzza, with as little concern as he tears a pullet.' He laughs, too, at the officers, and at their method of promotion. 'But the point of honour justly gives way to that of gain; and, by long and wise regulation, the richest is the bravest man. I have known a Captain rise to a Colonel in two days by the fall of stocks; and a Major, my good friend, near the Monument, ascended to that honour by the fall of the price of Spirits, and the rising of right Nantz.' And a great part of Tatler 41 is taken up by a laughing criticism on 'An Exercise of Arms,' which took place on June 29, <date value="1709">1709</date>, and was supposed to represent the putting down of a revolt. The sister service had no easy task under Anne, but were always hard at work, either at fighting, or convoying, or transport work, besides being always cruising about and snapping up prizes; and there were some good commanders in those days, whose names have descended to ours. What Englishman can forget the names of Benbow, Rooke, and Cloudesley Shovel? They were not always successful--as in the case of the first-named old sea-dog. On August 19, <date value="1702">1702</date>, he sighted the enemy's squadron, under Du Casse; on the
20th he engaged-but not till the 24th did he come to close quarters. His ship, the Breda, was then able to close with the sternmost French ship, which he himself boarded three times, and was twice wounded. He afterwards had his right leg shattered by a chain shot, and was carried below, but would insist on being carried on deck, where he remained the rest of the action. He disabled his opponent, but her consorts came to her relief, when four cowardly captains of his basely deserted him, in spite of his signals; so he had to give up the pursuit, and proceeded with his squadron to Jamaica, where he died Nov. 4. On Oct. 12, <date value="1702">1702</date>, Sir George Rooke burnt the French and Spanish shipping in Vigo, and sacked the town. This, besides the damage done to the foreign navies, was notorious for the enormous quantity of booty taken, both in specie, snuff, and
 THE ARMY AND NAVY.
<pb n="207" id="p.207"/> other goods. What the specie amounted to is not now known, but it was not so much as was expected, for by far the larger portion had been landed and sent into the interior of the country. Still it furnished a very handsome prize money for all concerned, although, as is usual in such cases, it was long before it was realised. A special coinage was made from this specie, and Ruding gives specimens of five-, two-, and one-guinea and half-guinea piecesand silver crowns, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences of this type. Some had the date  <date value="1702">1702</date>, others
<date value="1703">1703</date>, but in every case the word VIGO was under the Queen's bust. Luttrell gives a little anecdote about it. '20 Mar. 'I703. This week &#x00A3; <date value="1000">1000</date> of new mill'd money coyned out of the plate taken at Vigo was brought from the Tower to sir Christopher  Musgrave's office in the exchequer, and lock't up for her majestie's use, haveing the word Vigo under the queen's effigie.' It is not within the province of this book to go into details of the victories of the British navy in this reign, but we must not forget that Sir George Rooke won us, in <date value="1704">1704</date>, the rock of Gibraltar. The damage done to the French shipping during the long war must have been almost incalculable, not a daily paper or report from the sea-ports being without mention of some prizes

<pb n="208" id="p.208"/> Yet the service was not a popular one, at least with seamen, the way the navy was generally manned, by impress, being quite sufficient to make Jack fight shy of it. We hear of this impressing in the very first year of the reign. 'The Post Letters say there are 6 Press Ketches at Falmouth, which have pressed a considerable number of Men for her Majesty's Service.'  'Irish Letters of the 26th past say, they continue to beat up for Soldiers at Dublin, where abundance list themselves, and that some Press-Ketches in that Harbour have pressed 400 Seamen within a few Days, and that a great many are voluntarily come in.' 2 But though pressed, Jack was hard to hold, if he got a chance to get away. 'Hull, 1 March. Last week a Lieutenant came hither with a Press Gang, and had so good Success, that he soon Glean'd up a considerable number; but having no Vessel to put them on board, he turn'd them into an upper Room in the Town Gaol, and on Saturday they broke out through the top of the House and Escap'd.' 3 All means were tried to get men, and a bribe was held out by the Act 1 Anne, cap. 19, which provided for the discharge of every male prisoner for debt under &#x00A3; 20, and who had been in prison for six months, who should enlist either in the army or navy, and the same was afterwards tried by
4 &#x0026;  5 Anne, cap. 6. This serves to show the condition of the poor debtors, who were thus invited to ameliorate their position, by exchanging it for the 'Inferno' of a man-of-war of that period. Still we read early in <date value="1704">1704</date>: 'There is great impressing of Seamen for Her Majesties Service, she being resolved to have the Navy early at sea.' The bounty system was tried, and on Dec. 14, <date value="1704">1704</date>, the Queen issued a proclamation, offering two months' pay to every sailor volunteering, and one month's to every landsman. This proclamation also vowed vengeance against deserters, ordered officers of press gangs to press no old men, boys, or infirm persons, and promised them 'Twenty Shillings for each Seaman, and Sixpence per Man for each Mile he shall be brought, if under

 THE ARMY and NAVY.
<pb n="209" id="p.209"/> twenty Miles, and Ten Shillings for each Seaman that shall be brought above Twenty Miles, over and above the said Twenty Shillings.' This arbitrary system of impressing was so cruel, that one feels heartily glad to find that it is possible there might be another side to the question, and that a man might be punished for it. 'Yesterday one Philpot was by the court of Queen's Bench fined 10 Nobles, and to stand in the pillory on Tower Hill, for wrongfully pressing one Gill, and taking 4 Guineas for his discharge.'1 One man seems to have had the courage to speak against it, and I regret I have been unable to get his pamphlet. 'Just Published. The Old and True Way of Manning the Fleet, Or how to Retrieve the Glory of the English Arms by Sea, as it is done by Land; and to have Seamen always in readiness, without Pressing. In a Letter from an old Parliament Sea Commander, to a Member of the present House of Commons, desiring his Advice on that Subject. Printed in the Year <date value="1707">1707</date>.' The pay was not so bad, &#x00A3; 4 a month 2 but the service was unpopular-the officers were rough and foul-mouthed, whose creed was,' I hate the French, love a handsome Woman and a Bowl of Punch' 3-so the men deserted whenever they could. It was no use issuing proclamations offering a reward of twenty shillings for every such deserter delivered up on board ship; they kept their pay back, and tried to allure them from the joys of freedom and the shore by bidding them repair on board their ships to receive their pay due six months back, still keeping six months in hand. Jack was proof against such blandishments: so the authorities tried another plan-the magnanimous-and promised to forgive the deserters, if only they would come back; anything to get the dear fellows on board, all would be forgotten and forgiven, and joy and peace should reign henceforth. 'All such Seamen that are made run, for not repairing to their Duty, shall have their R's taken off, and be continued in Wages from the times they have been absent, provided they do forthwith repair on board.' As this is the only instance I can meet with of this bait being held out, one rather suspects Luttrell, July 14, <date value="1709">1709</date>.  2 Ibid.

<pb n="210" id="p.210"/> Jack was not quite such a fool as they imagined him, and, once free, had no wish to get into the trap again. Brown 1 gives a description of the Admiralty in his time:
'By this time we were come to the Admiralty Office, the outside invited us in, and here we found only a Company of Tarrs, walking to and fro with their Hands in their Pockets, as on the Quarter Deck aboard; in one Room there was a company of Lieutenants, some had serv'd twenty Years without being rais'd, because they either knew not how to Bribe in the right Place, or were so tenacious of what they had so hardly purchas'd, that their only hopes were now Half Pay or Superannuation. In another place were Seamen's Wives with Petitions, and pressing Deputy B--, who was as surly to them, as a true Whigg in Office; but tho' he demanded no Fee, he could be mollified by a little Fellow feeling, that like a Sop to Cerberus, let Petitions and Men pass too; Then you fall in betwixt Scylla and Charybdis, the Clerks on one Side, and Sea Captains on the other; where Cowards that have lost one Ship, easily get another; and Men of Valour, without Interest, wait in vain for Preferment, from those who dispose of what they do not understand; for here the Land determines of the Main, and he that never see the North Foreland, disposes of things, as if he knew all the Creeks and Bays, Shelves, Sands, and Nations of the Universe.' From contemporary descriptions Jack's nature has not much altered since Anne's time. Ward thus sums him up:
' I could not but reflect on the unhappy Lives of these Salt Water kind of Vagabonds, who are never at Home but when they're at Sea, and always are wandering when they're at Home; and never contented but when they're on Shore; They're never at ease till they've receiv'd their Pay, and then never satisfied till they have spent it; And when their Pockets are empty, they are just as much respected by their Landladies (who cheat them of one half, if they spend the other) as a Father is by his Son-in-Law, who has Beggar'd himself to give him a good Portion with his Daughter.' In the mercantile marine, there was a large trade done

Capital punishment was, of course, more frequent than in our days, because there were so many more offences punishable by it. In London alone, from the commencement of Sir Thos. Abney's mayoralty in
<date value="1701">1701</date>, to the end of that of Sir Richard Hoare in <date value="1713">1713</date>, 242 malefactors were hanged at Tyburn and other places. It was of such frequent occurrence that men got callous about it, nay, joked of it. 'Mr. Ordinary visits his melancholy Flock at Newgate by Eight. Doleful Procession up Holborn Hill about Eleven. Men handsome and proper, that were never thought so before, which is some Comfort however, Arrive at the fatal Place at Twelve. Burnt Brandy, Women and Sabbath breaking repented of. Some few Penitential Drops fall under the Gallows. Sheriffs Men, Parson, Pickpockets, Criminals, all very busie. The last concluding peremptory Psalm struck up. Show over by One.' Misson gives a far longer account, full of detail, of an execution in those days. He says: 'Hanging is the most
 CRIME.
<pb n="213" id="p.213"/> common Punishment in England. Usually this Execution is done in a great Road about a quarter of a League from the Suburbs of London. The Sessions for trying Criminals being held but eight Times a Year, there are sometimes twenty Malefactors to be hang'd at a Time.
'They put five 2 or six in a Cart (some gentlemen obtain leave to perform this journey in a coach) and carry them riding backwards with the Rope about their Necks, to the fatal Tree. The Executioner stops the Cart under one of the Cross Beams of the Gibbet, and fastens to that ill-favoured Beam one End of the Rope, while the other is round the Wretches Neck: This done, he gives the Horse a Lash with his Whip, away goes the Cart, and there swings my Gentleman Kicking in the Air.
' The Hangman does not give himself the Trouble to put them out of their Pain; but some of their Friends or Relations do it for them. They pull the dying Person by the Legs, and beat his Breast to dispatch him as soon as possible. The English are People that laugh at the Delicacy of other Nations, who make it such a mighty Matter to be hang'd; their extraordinary Courage looks upon it as a Trifle, and they also make a Jest of the pretended Dishonour, that in the Opinion of others, falls upon their Kindred.
' He that is to be hang'd, or otherwise executed, first takes Care to get himself shav'd, and handsomely drest, either in Mourning, or in the Dress of a Bridegroom. This done, he sets his Friends at Work to get him Leave to be bury'd, and to carry his Coffin with him, which is easily obtain'd. When his Suit of Cloaths, or Night Gown, his Gloves, Hat, Perriwig, Nosegay, Coffin, Flannel Dress for his Corps, and all those Things are bought and prepar'd, the main Point is taken Care of, his Mind is at Peace, and then he thinks of his Conscience. Generally he studies a Speech, which he pronounces under the Gallows, and gives in Writing to the Sheriff, or the Minister that attends him in his last Moments, desiring that it may be printed. Sometimes the Girls dress in White, with great Silk Scarves, and carry Baskets full of Flowers and Oranges, scattering these Favours all the Way they go. But
1 Tyburn.            2 Usually three.

<pb n="214" id="p.214"/> to represent Things as they really are, I must needs own that if a pretty many of these People dress thus gayly, and go to it with such an Air of Indifference, there are many others that go slovenly enough, and with very dismal Phizzes.
'I remember, one Day, I saw in the Park, a handsome Girl, very well drest, that was then in Mourning for her Father, who had been hang'd but a Month before at Tyburn for false Coinage. So many Countries, so many Fashions.' There were sad and revolting scenes at the gallows. The notorious Captain Kidd, the pirate, went to his death drunk, which, as Paul Lorrain, the Ordinary of Newgate, observes,
'had so decomposed his Mind, that now it was in a very bad frame.' The rope broke, and he fell to the ground, which somewhat sobered him, and before he was finally strangled he listened to the chaplain's ministrations. A previous chaplain, in <date value="1691">1691</date>, was roughly treated by one Tom Cox, a highwayman,l' for before he was turn'd off, Mr. Smith, the Ordinary, desiring him to join with the rest of his Fellow Sufferers in Prayer, he swore a great Oath to the contrary, and kickt him and the Hangman too off the Cart.' When one Dick Hughes, a housebreaker, was in <date value="1709">1709</date> going to execution,2 'his wife met him at Saint Giles's Pound, where, the Cart stopping, she stept up to him, and whispering in his Ear, said, My dear, who must find the Rope that's to hang you, We or the Sheriff? Her Husband reply'd, The Sheriff, Honey; for who's obliged to find him Tools to do his Work ? Ah ! (reply'd his Wife) I wish I had known so much before, 'twould have sav'd me two Pence, for I have been and bought one already. Well, well, (said Dick again) perhaps it mayn't be lost, for it may serve a second Husband. Yes,
(quoth his Wife) if I've any Luck in good Husbands, so it may.' Another story is told, in the same book, of one Jack Witherington, a highwayman, who, when going up Holborn Hill to execution, 'he order'd the Cart to stop, then desiring to speak to the Sheriff's Deputy, who attends Criminals to the Place of Execution, he said to him, I owe, Sir, a small

Hereupon the Deputy Sheriff telling him that if such a Mischance should happen, he would Bail him; Jack, as not thinking he had such a good Friend to stand by him in time of Need, rid very contentedly to Tyburn.' The system of strangulation then in vogue was favourable to the recovery of life, as is shown by the following extract from the Flying Post, Dec. 11 / 13, <date value="1705">1705</date>: ' Yesterday one John Smith,l Condemned last Sessions for House breaking, was carried from  Newgate to Tyburn to be executed.  Some minutes after he was turned off, a Reprieve came for him, and being immediately cut down, he soon reviv'd, to the admiration of all Spectators, and was brought back to Newgate.' The Newgate Calendar reports that, 'being asked what were his sensations, after he was turned off; he answered, That at first he felt great pain, but that it gradually subsided, and that the last thing he could remember, was the appearance of a light in his eyes, after which he became quite insensible. But the greatest pain was, when he felt the blood returning to its proper channels.' He received a free pardon a few weeks afterwards, and one would have imagined would have altered his ways, after so narrow an escape; but he was apprehended for a similar offence, tried at the Old Bailey, and was acquitted on a point of law. Yet once more was he caught, and this time was acquitted by the death of the prosecutor. His ultimate fate is not known. But this was nothing to the marvellous resuscitation of Anne Greene, who was hanged at Oxford Dec. 14, <date value="1651">1651</date>, and was afterwards revived-and got quite well. She was condemned for the murder of her child, which was afterwards discovered to have been stillborn; and that there was no deception in her execution her history2 assures us, for she See page 203.  2 Brit. Mus. E. 625

<pb n="216" id="p.216"/> was hanging by the neck for the space of almost half an hour, some of her friends in the meantime thumping her on the breast, others hanging with all their weight upon her legges;
'sometimes lifting her up, and then pulling her down againe with a suddaine jerke, thereby the sooner to despatch her out of her paine; insomuch that the Under-Sheriff, fearing lest thereby they should breake the rope, forbad them to do so any longer.' And not only so, but when she was taken in her coffin to Dr. Petty, the professor of anatomy, 'she was observed to breathe, and obscurely to ruttle; which being perceived by a lusty fellow that stood by, he (thinking to do an act of Charity in ridding her out of the small reliques of a painful life) stamped several times on her breast and Stomack with all the force he could.' This considerate treatment could not overcome the girl's vitality, for by dint of bleeding and good nursing she entirely recovered, and went to her own home, taking with her her coffin, and a goodly sum of money, which had been subscribed for her benefit, and which remained after defraying all charges necessary to her recovery. The scaffold still lingered on Tower Hill, but this was reserved for political offenders. A remnant of the barbarous use of torture still remained
(indeed, it was not abolished until the year <date value="1772">1772</date>) in the peine forte et dure. This punishment was inflicted when a prisoner refused to plead 'guilty' or 'not guilty,' which was then necessary before the trial could be gone on with. Now, if a prisoner refuses to plead, he is regarded as pleading
'not guilty,' and the trial goes on. People have died under this torture rather than plead, because by that means they preserved their property to their friends, which would have been confiscated had they pleaded and been found guilty of felony. Misson gives the following description of the ' Peine forte et dure or pressing to death. When a Felon, punishable with Death, takes a Resolution not to make any Answer to his Judges, after the Second Calling upon, he is carry'd back to his Dungeon, and is put to a Sort of Rack called Peine forte et dure. If he speaks, his Indictment goes on in the usual
 CRIME.
<pb n="217" id="p.217"/> Forms; if he continues dumb, they leave him to die under that Punishment. He is stretch'd out naked upon his Back, and his Arms and Legs drawn out by cords, and fasten'd to the four Corners of the Dungeon: A Board or Plate of Iron is laid upon his Stomach, and this is heap'd up with Stones to a certain Weight.

'The next Day they give him, at three different times, three little Morsels of Barly Bread, and nothing to Drink: the next Day, three little Glasses of Water, and nothing to Eat: And, if he continues in his Obstinacy, they leave him in that Condition 'till he dies. This is practis'd only upon Felons, or Persons guilty of Petty Treason. Criminals of High Treason, in the like Case, would be condemn'd to the usual Punishment; their Silence would Condemn them.' Hanging in chains was a distinction to which highwaymen and pirates were entitled, after having combined

<pb n="218" id="p.218"/> murder with theft. It consisted of fastening the body into a sort of cage, made of iron hoops, and then hanging it upon the gibbet-which was bound to be on the very road where the crime was committed. Highway robbery was, unfortunately, very common in this reign; but the perpetrators were mostly pitiful wretches, whose career, while it lasted, was far from brilliant, and generally it was a very short one. All the romance of the highway died with Claude Du Val, who was executed on Jan. 21, <date value="1670">1670</date>, in the 27th year of his age. His short career ended ingloriously, for he was taken, when drunk, at the
' Hole in the Wall,' in Chandos Street. Whatever caused the furore over the poor rogue ? We are told : ' There were a great Company of Ladies, and those not of the meanest Degree, that visited him in Prison, interceded for his Pardon, and accompany'd him to the Gallows, with swoll'n Eyes, and Cheeks blubber'd with Tears under their Vizards. After he had hang'd a Convenient Time, he was cut down, and by Persons well dress'd carry'd into a mourning Coach, and so Convey'd to the Tangier Tavern in St. Giles's, where he lay in State all that Night, the Room hung with black Cloth, the Herse cover'd with Scutcheons, eight Wax Tapers burning, as many tall Gentlemen with long Cloaks attending; Mum was the Word, and great Silence expected from all that visited, for Fear of disturbing the sleeping Lion. And this Ceremony had lasted much longer, had not one of the Judges sent to disturb this Pageantry.
. . . He was bury'd with many Flambeaus, and with a numerous Train of Mourners, most whereof were of the beautiful Sex; he lyes in the Middle Isle of Covent Garden Church, under a White Marble Stone, whereon are curiously engrav'd the Du Val's Arms.' The stories of their feats are very much alike, varied only in their degree of brutality. One however, if true, is somewhat out of the ordinary ruck, and it is told 2 of the same Lord Mohun (' Dog Mohun,' as Swift calls him) who fought the Duke of Hamilton.
'Another time Ned Wicks meeting with the late Lord

<pb n="219" id="p.219"/> Mohun on the Road betwixt Windsor and Colebrook, attended only with a Groom and one Footman, he commanded his Lordship to stand and deliver, for he was in great Want of Money, and Money he would have before they parted. His Honour, pretending to have a great deal of Courage, swore he should fight for it then. Wicks very readily accepted the Proposal, and preparing his Pistols for an Engagement, his Lordship seeing his Resolution, he began to hang back, which his Antagonist perceiving, he began to be Cock on hoop, saying "All the World knows me to be a Man; and tho' your Lordship was concern'd in the Cowardly murdering of Mumford the Player, and Captain Cout, yet I'm not to be frighten'd at that; therefore down with your Gold, or else expect no Quarter." His Lordship now meeting with his Match, it put him into such a passionate Fit of swearing, that Wicks not willing to be outdone in any Wickedness, quoth he, "My Lord, I perceive you swear perfectly well ex tempore; come, I'll give your Honour a fair Chance for your Moneys, and that is, he that swears best of us two, shall keep his own, and his that loseth." His Lordship agreed to this Bargain, and throwing down a Purse of 50 Guineas, which Wicks match'd with a like Sum; after a quarter of an Hours Swearing most prodigiously on both Sides, it was left to his Lordship's Groom to decide the Matter; who said, "Why, indeed your Honour Swears as well as ever I heard a Person of Quality in my Life; but, indeed, to give the Strange Gentleman his Due, he has won the Wager if 'twas for a thousand Pounds. Whereupon Wicks taking up the Gold, he gave the Groom a Guinea, and rid about his Business.' A highwayman certainly carried his life in his hand-he was a Wolf's head, and, every man's hand being against him, he was shot whenever he could be, and a reward of forty pounds was given for the capture of one of them. In <date value="1712">1712</date> one Joseph Reader, a miller of Shaftesbury, was attacked by a highwayman, who fired twice at him, and missed doing him any injury. The miller, judging that he had expended his ammunition, closed with him, knocked him off his horse with his cudgel, and beat him senseless. He then dragged him to a tree, and hanged him with his own belt. For this,

<pb n="220" id="p.220"/> Reader was tried at Dorchester, and acquitted; and a subscription was got up for him in court, which amounted to over 30 &#x00A3;. Ward describes a typical highwayman: ' Another you needs must take particular notice of, that pluck'd out a pair of Pocket Pistols, and laid them in the Window, who had a great Scar cross his Forehead, a twisted Wig, and lac'd Hat on; the Company call'd him Captain; he's a man of Considerable Reputation amongst Birds of the same Feather, who I have heard say thus much in his Praise, that he is as Resolute a Fellow as ever Cock'd Pistol upon the Road; and indeed I do believe he fears no Man in the World but the Hang Man; and dreads no death but Choaking. He's as generous as a Prince, treats any Body that will keep him Company; loves his friends as dearly as the Ivy does the Oak, will never leave him till he has Hug'd him to his Ruin. He has drawn in twenty of his Associates to be Hang'd, but had always Wit and Money enough to save his own Neck from the Halter. He has good friends at Newgate, who give him now and then a Squeeze when he is in full Fuice; and give him their Words to stand by him, which he takes as a Verbal Policy of Insurance from the Gallows, till he grows Poor thro' Idleness, and then, (he has Cunning enough to know) he may be Hang'd thro' Poverty. He's well acquainted with the Ostlers about Bishopsgate Street, and Smithfield; and gains from them Intelligence of what Booties goe out that are worth attempting. He accounts them very honest Tikes, and can with all safety trust his Life in their Hands, for now and then Gilding their Palms for the good Services they do him. He pretends to be a Disbanded Officer, and reflects very feelingly upon the hard usage we poor Gentlemen meet with, who have hazarded our Lives and Fortunes for the Honour of our Prince, the Defence of our Country, and Safety of Religion; and after all to be Broke without our Pay, turn'd out without any consideration for the dangers and difficulties we have run thro'; at this rate, Wounds, who the Devil wou'd be a Soldier ?' Their personal appearance-which, it is needless to say, was not the gold-laced costume so beloved of the stage and
 CRIME.
<pb n="221" id="p.221"/> penny dreadfuls-is given in the following advertisement:
' Stolen from Sam. Brett Servant to Mr. Bayly of Romford in Essex by two Highwaymen, one in a light colour'd Suit trim'd with the same, a light coloured Wig and hood, the other in a light colour'd Coat trim'd with Black Button holes on each side, and dark brown Hair,' etc. And their style of doing business may be learnt from the following: 'On Wednesday night the Cambridge, Norwich, and Linn Stage Coaches, were all 3 Robbed by one single Man in Epping Forest.' 'Stafford 17 Feb. We have had great Robbing lately in these parts by a Gang of Highway men: On the
3oth past, they set upon the Shrewsbury Stage Coach and plunder'd all the passengers; and afterwards met with 3 Country Attorneys, which they Robb'd also; one of them having put 20 Guineas into his Shooes, the Rogues for haste, cut the Straps of the Port Mantle, and threw the Shooes away; after they were gone, the Attorney took up both Shooes and Gold. On the 9th instant they set upon two Drovers coming from New Castle Fair, took a great deal of Money, kill'd one of them on the Spot, and dangerously wounded the other. On the 11th May set upon the High Sheriff of the County with his Lady and Servants, coming from Lichfield Fair, took 60 Guineas from them, and cut off one of the Servants Hands. Since which several of them are taken, of which two are committed to Warwick Gaol, two to Stafford, and two Men and three Women to Litchfield; one of the Women was dress'd in Man's Apparel when they robb'd the Stage Coach.'
' The Mails due at London the 10th of Sept. from Ireland and Chester, having been seiz'd by 3 Highwaymen between Dunstable and St. Alban's, and several Letters opened. These are to give Notice thereof, that care may be taken to prevent the payment of such Bills as have by this means been intercepted.' Advertisements frequently occur of men being taken up on suspicion of being highwaymen, but one would fancy there could be but little doubt of the profession of this gentleman. 'There is now in Custody in her Majesty's Gaol of Newgate in London, James Biswick, alias Bissick, a middle

'The foot pads are very troublesome in the evenings on all the roads leading to this Citty, which renders them very unsafe,' writes Luttrell in <date value="1702">1702</date>, and that he did not exaggerate, take these two instances occurring in that year. 'Last Wednesday Night, a Fencing Master coming to Town from Pancrass, was set upon by some Foot Pads, who, finding he had no Money about him, beat him so barbarously, that his Life is despaired of.' 'On Thursday night, between eight and nine, a Gentleman, who lives at Little Chelsea, was set upon by four Ruffians on this side Chelsea College, who knock'd him down, rifled him of all he had of Worth about him, and left him miserably bruis'd and beaten; but another Gentleman and his Man happening to come by, and seeing him, they together pursued the Rogues, recovered the Gentleman's Hat, Sword, Perriwig, and most of his Money, and took two of the Rogues, who are since committed; but the other two escaped with the Gentleman's Watch and Seal.' In <date value="1703">1703</date>,
'3 strowling Gipsies are ordered down to Huntington to be Tryed for Robbing two Women, and leaving them bound together on the Road Naked.' In <date value="1704">1704</date>,'A Gentleman going from St. James's to Kensington was met and attacked in Hide Park by two Foot Pads, who took from him his Sword, Watch, Perriwig, and Rings, in all to the value of 130 pounds and left him in a deplorable condition.' These are a few examples only, but they are sufficient to show us the insecurity of the public roads at that time. The Newgate Calendar gives a long list of crime in this reign, but they are all of the ordinary type, murder, highway robberies, and burglaries with violence, which last was a capital offence; and so indeed it ought to be, were there
 CRIME.                        <pb id="p.223" n="223"/> many such burglaries as this: 'We hear that on Tuesday night last, five Housebreakers broke into Sir Charles Thorn's House near Bedington in Surrey, and having Jagg'd 1 his Servants, got into his Bed Chamber. At their Entrance Sir Charles fir'd a Pistol at them, which unhappily miss'd doing Execution; upon this they bound and Jagg'd him, and afterwards one of them attempted to insult his Lady; at which Sir Charles being exasperated, with much struggling he got his Hands at Liberty, and flung a Perriwig block at the Villain's Head; who in revenge stabbed Sir Charles, then cut his Throat from Ear to Ear, and left him Dead on the Spot. They afterwards Ransack'd the House, and it's said, carried off to the value of &#x00A3; 900 in Money and Plate. The Lady Thorn is so ill by this barbarous Treatment, that her Life is despaired of.' There was a most famous housebreaker in this reignone John Hall, a chimney-sweep, who has a small literature entirely devoted to him-besides having dis-'honourable mention' in the Newgate Calendar, and his biography written by no less a person than Paul Lorrain, the Ordinary of Newgate (who is mentioned both in Tatler 63 and Spectator
<pb n="338" id="p.338"/>). He had a long poetical elegy composed on him, after the fashion of the times-and an epitaph:- Here lies Hall's Clay  At judgment day,  I'd better say Thus swept away;   He'd make essay  Here lies Jack Hall, If bolt or key     To get away:   And that is all. Obliged his Stay   Be 't as it may, An Act passed in the fifth year of Anne's reign offered a Government reward of &#x00A3; 40 and a pardon to any person concerned in breaking open houses, who shall discover two or more of his accomplices, upon their conviction; whilst the 6 Anne, cap. 9, which deals with simple burglaries, housebreaking, or robbery in shops, etc., repeats the 10 Will. III., cap. 12, sec. 6, which provided that 'every Person and Persons, who should be convicted of or for any Theft or Larceny, and should have the Benefit of the Clergy allowed thereupon, or ought to be burnt in the Hand for such Offence: instead of being burnt
1 Gagged.

<pb n="224" id="p.224"/> in the Hand should be burnt in the most visible part of the left Cheek nearest the Nose;' and settles that henceforth they shall be burnt in the hand. This 'Benefit of the Clergy'is thus described by Misson:
'About 600 Years ago in the reign of William the Second, the People of England were so strangely ignorant, that the very Priests could hardly read. The King, in order to bring the People out of such a State of Darkness made a Law, that in certain Cases (as Man Slaughter, Theft, (for the first Time) not exceeding the Sum of &#x00A3; 5 Sterling, and committed without Burglary, or putting the Person robb'd into bodily Fear, Polygamy, &#x0026;c.) the Convict might save his Life, and escape with no other Punishment but burning in the Hand, if he were so great a Scholar as to be able to read; and tho' at present there is hardly the meanest Peasant in England but what can read, yet the Law is still in Force. They say to the Criminal, Thou N, who art convicted of having committed such and such a Crime, what hast thou to demand in Favour of thy self, to hinder Sentence of Death being pass'd upon thee ? The Criminal answers, I demand the Benefit of the Clergy. His demand is granted, and the Ordinary of Newgate gives him a Book, printed in the old Gothic' Letter, in which the Criminal reads a few Words. Then the Lord Mayor, or one of the Judges, asks the Ordinary Legitne vel non ? And the Ordinary answers Legit ut Clericus.
' However, when the Criminal has a Right to demand the Benefit of the Clergy, they seldom give themselves the trouble to examine whether they can read or no; be he the greatest Scholar in the World, or the greatest Blockhead, tis all a Case, so he gives but a little Spite of Money to the Ordinary, who tells him in a low Voice (which the whole Court may hear) three or four words, which he pronounces, and there's an End of the matter. 'Tis always taken for granted that a Peer can read, and he is never burnt in the Hand when he claims the Benefit of the Clergy.' By the 6 Anne, cap. 9, this ceremony of reading was abolished, although the privilege remained the same, and this

<pb n="225" id="p.225"/> singular custom was not altogether, and entirely, done away with until <date value="1841">1841</date>, 4 &#x0026;  5 Vict. 22. Coining, as infringing the king's prerogative, and being a serious injury to the commonweal, was, of course, a capital offence. One can understand coiners of base metal being punished; those who were cunning in 'the Art of making Black Dogs, which are Shillings, or other pieces of Money made only of Pewter, double Wash'd. What the Professors of this Hellish Art call George Plateroon, is all copper within, with only a thin Plate about it; and what they call Compositum, is a mix'd Metal, which will both touch and cut, but not endure the fiery Test'; but by what reasoning should the following gentleman be found guilty of crime ?       Sir Richard Blackham, formerly a Merchant, was at the sessions house in the Old Baily this week found guilty of Misprision of treason for melting down the coin of England, and making foreign coins of it.' The ordinary pickpocket was common enough. Let us hear what Gay says of him :- Here dives the skulking Thief, with practis'd Slight, And unfelt Fingers make thy Pocket light. Where's now thy Watch, with all its Trinkets, flown ? And thy late Snuff Box is no more thy own. But lo ! his bolder Thefts some Tradesman spies, Swift from his Prey the scudding Lurcher flies; Dext'rous he scapes the Coach, with nimble Bounds, While ev'ry honest Tongue Stop Thief resounds. So speeds the wily Fox, alarm'd by Fear, Who lately filch'd the Turkey's callow Care; Hounds following Hounds, grow louder as he flies, And injur'd Tenants joyn the Hunter's Cries. Breathless he stumbling falls : Ill fated Boy ! Why did not honest Work thy Youth employ ? Seiz'd by rough Hands, he's dragg'd amid the Rout, And stretch'd beneath the Pump's incessant Spout: Or plung'd in miry Ponds, he gasping lies, Mud Choaks his Mouth, and plaisters o'er his Eyes. In every age the question may be asked, 'Quis custodiet ipsos custodes ?' and it might have been a propos in <date value="1703">1703</date>, when ' A Thieftaker was also brought upon his Tryal for

Of course, if people were so stupid as to bedizen their children with gold chains, they could not well grumble, and only had themselves to blame, if 'fat squat' wenches occasionally took advantage of their trustfulness and appropriated the trinkets. 'A Child about 6 Years Old being led away by a Fat Squat Wench, on Monday, being the 13th Instant, at 5 of the Clock in the Evening, from Brook Street in Ratcliffe to Golden Lane without Cripplegate, being robbed of a Gold Chain marked A.

Townsend's at the Jamaica Coffee House in Cornhill.' As a rule, people were only too glad to get back their property, and felonies were compounded in the most unblushing way-' No questions asked' being almost universally a portion of an advertisement for missing or stolen property. One parish was very zealous in its work of criminal purgation. 'A Reward for Apprehending of Thieves in the Parish of Stoak Newington, in the County of Middlesex, that shall commit the Fact in the said Parish.
'Whosoever shall apprehend, or cause to be apprehended, any Person or Persons for Felony or Burglary, or for any petty Larceny, committed within the said Parish within one year from the date hereof, shall receive for every person so apprehended and convicted of petty Larcency, 40s. which shall be paid by the Church Wardens of the said Parish, upon demand, after Such Conviction, and the said Church Wardens shall be at all Charges of the Prosecution, they being order'd to do so at a Vestry held for the said Parish, on the 26th of December <date value="1704">1704</date>.'

The Barrister was surpris'd at his Demand, as not knowing him; and looking on the Bond, his Hand was so exactly Counterfeited, that he could not in a manner deny it to be his own Writing; but that he knew his own Circumstances were such, that he was never in any Necessity of borrowing so much Money in all his Life of any Man; therefore, as he could not be indebted in any such Sum, upon the account of borrowing, he told Tom, he would not Pay 100 Pounds in his own Wrong. Hereupon Tom, taking his Leave, he told him, he must expect speedy Trouble; and in the meantime, Mr. Manning expecting the same, sent for another Barrister, to whom opening the matter, they concluded it was a forg'd Bond; whereupon Mr. Manning's Council got a general Release forg'd for the Payment of this 100 Pounds; and when Issue was join'd, and the Cause came to be try'd before the late Lord Chief Justice Holt, the Witnesses to Tom Sharpe's Bond, swore so heartily to his lending of the Money to the Defendant that he was in a very fair way of being cast; 'till Mr. Manning's Council moving the Court in behalf of his Client, acquainted his Lordship that they did not deny the having borrow'd 100 Pounds of the Plaintiff, but that it had been paid for above three Months. Three Months !
(quoth his Lordship) and why did not the Defendant then take up his Bond, or see it cancell'd ? To this, his Council reply'd, that when they paid the Money, the Bond could not be found, whereupon the Defendant took a general Release for Payment thereof; which being produc'd in Court, and two Knights of the Post swearing to it, the Plaintiff was cast. Which putting Tom Sharpe into a great Passion, he cry'd to his Companions, as he was coming through Westminster Hall, Was ever such Rogues seen in this World before, to swear they paid that which they never borrow'd ?' There were plenty of 'Chevaliers d'Industrie' in those days, and many were the traps set for the gullible and unwary.

'To prevent People being imposed upon by Beggers, The President and Governors for the Poor of the City of London give Notice, that on the 18th of this instant April one Eliza Cozens was brought into the Workhouse for Begging, with a Paper on her Breast, viz.

She is now  at the Workhouse in Bishopsgate Street, to be seen by any that please.' Another somewhat similar notice was issued by the same authorities, about one Mary Welch, and two children, who were sent to the workhouse 'for Begging on Horseback, Rapt up in Sheets and Blankets, pretending to be burnt in

And there are other advertisements of like import, of which the following is most worthy of notice, as the impostor got his deserts:-
'... There is now in their Workhouse in Bishopsgate Street, one Rob. Cunningham, a Man of about 40 years of Age, who went begging up and down this City, and other Places, with this Paper following:- To the Pious Reader.

Upon the first Discovery of them, my friend was in some doubt whether he should not exert the Justice of the Peace upon such a Band of Lawless Vagrants ; but not having his Clerk with him, who is a necessary Counsellor on these Occasions, and fearing that his Poultry might fare the worse for it, he let the Thought drop: But at the same time gave me a particular Account of the Mischiefs they do in the Country, in stealing People's Goods and spoiling their Servants. If a stray Piece of Linnen hangs upon an Hedge, says Sir Roger, they are sure to have it; if the Hog loses his Way in the Fields, it is ten to one but he becomes their Prey; our Geese cannot live in Peace for them: if a Man prosecutes them with Severity, his Hen roost is sure to pay for it; They generally straggle into these Parts about this Time of the Year; and set the Heads of our Servant Maids so agog for Husbands, that we do not expect to have any Business done as it should be whilst they are in the Country. I have an honest Dairy Maid, that crosses their Hands with a Piece of Silver every Summer, and never fails being promised the handsomest young Fellow in the Parish for her Pains. Your Friend the Butler has been Fool enough to be seduced by them; and, though he is sure to lose a Knife, a Fork or a Spoon every time his fortune is told, generally shuts himself up in the Pantry with an old Gypsie for above half an Hour once in a Twelvemonth. Sweethearts are the things they live upon, which they bestow very plentifully upon all those that apply themselves to them. You see now and then some handsome young Jades among them: The Sluts have often white Teeth and black Eyes.'1 The laws were cruelly severe against them, as Misson notes. 'By Acts of Parliament and Statutes made in the Reign of Henry 8th and his two Daughters, all those People calling themselves Bohemians or Egyptians, are hangable as

In <date value="1704">1704</date> the president and governors of the poor of London set a good example to the other municipalities of the kingdom by issuing a proclamation against 'Rogues, Vagabonds, and Sturdy Beggars,' and promised to anyone who should apprehend one of these objectionable persons, and, taking him before a justice of the peace, get him committed to the Workhouse, a reward of twelve pence 'towards the Charges of this so doing,' and it further recited the pains and penalties contained in the 29 Eliz. cap. 7, and 1 Jas. I. cap. 7, on those people who hindered their apprehension, and neglect of duty on the part of constables and others. Perhaps it was as well to, now and then, remind the constables of their duties, for, if we may believe Ward, they were a very queer lot. 'He always walks Arm'd with a Staff of Authority, Seal'd with the Royal Arms, and all Wise People think the Fellow that Carries it a great Blot in the Scutcheon ... They are the only Encouragers of what they pretend to Suppress, Protecting those People, for Bribes, which they should punish; Well Knowing each Bad house they break is a Weekly Stipend, out of their own Pockets.' Here is a case in which they were made to eat the leek.
'On Tuesday last, at Guild Hall, came on the Tryal of the Constables for their insolent Behaviour the last Year, when the Honourable Plaintiffs, at the humble Request of the Defendants, out of pure Compassion for them and their indigent Families, were charitably pleas'd to forgive 'em, upon the following Submission:

FRANCIS VIOLET. JOHN BAVIS.'1 Pollaky and the private inquiry offices were foreshadowed by the subjoined. 'This is to give notice that those who have sustained any loss at Sturbridge Fair last, by Pick Pockets or Shop lifts: If they please to apply themselves to John Bonner in Shorts Gardens, they may receive information and assistance therein; also Ladies and others who lose their Watches at Churches, and other Assemblies, may be served by him as aforesaid, to his utmost power, if desired by the right Owner, he being paid for his Labour and Expences.' Nor do we enjoy the monopoly of gigantic commercial swindles and official peculations: human nature was pretty much the same. 'This day, one Mr. C--, a great exchange broker, who dealt mostly in Stocks, went off, as said, for above &#x00A3; 100,000.' 2

This day the Commons resolved, that the late Commissioners of the Victualling office, in neglecting to keep regular accounts, in making out perfect bills to clear imprests without vouchers, and in not keeping a regular course in payment of their bills, and not making regular assignments thereof, have been guilty of a breach of trust, and acted contrary to their instructions.

These are not examples of a pleasant social state, and yet it seems that things might have been worse. 'I happen'd to be in a Company t'other day, among some persons who were very well acquainted with both London and Paris, where it was made a Question, Which of those two famous Cities was most debauch'd?  'Twas urg'd that the excessive Clemency of the English Laws gave Room for abundance of ill Actions that would not else be committed. Their Punishments have nothing terrible in them but Death. A Rack is not known among them; and their Examination of Criminals is not at all severe. The Judges are extremely favourable to them; false Witnesses lie under but a slight Penalty; and there is a Relaxation which may be call'd an Inexecution of the Laws. Then as to Bankruptcies, and other Villanies of that Nature, the City of London is so full of privileg'd Places, where such Thieves may take Shelter, that upon the whole it must be

There were minor punishments: the stocks and the pillory, the former used for petty, the latter for somewhat graver, offences. Defoe had to stand in the latter, and celebrated his defiance of his punishment in 'a HYMN to the PILLORY.' It was all very well for him to write- Hail Hi'roglyphick State Machin, Contriv'd to Punish Fancy in: Men that are Men, in thee can feel no Pain, And all thy Insignificants Disdain

<pb n="235" id="p.235"/> The undistinguish'd Fury of the Street, Which Mob and Malice Mankind Greet, No Byass can the Rabble draw, But Dirt throws Dirt without respect to Merit or to Law. Everyone is familiar with the general features of the pillory,, but yet a contemporaneous account, by a keen-sighted witness, will materially help to bring it vividly before us.
' This Punishment is allotted for those who are convicted of any notorious Cheat, or infamous Imposture; of having publish'd defamatory Libels against the King or Government; of false Testimony, and of publick Blasphemy; They are expos'd in a high Place, with their Heads put thro' two Pieces of notch'd Wood; the uppermost whereof being made to slide down, shuts the Neck into the Notch. The Criminals Hands are confin'd on each Side his Head in the same Manner; and thus he stands in this ridiculous Posture for more or less time, or with more or fewer Repetitions, according to his Sentence. If the People think there is nothing very odious in the Action that rais'd him to this Honour,, they stand quietly by, and only look at him; but if he has been guilty of some Exploit dislik'd by the Tribe of 'Prentices, he must expect to be regaled with a hundred thousand handfuls of Mud, and as many rotten Eggs as can be got for Money. It is not lawful to throw Stones, but yet 'tis often done.  Generally the honest Man wears a large Sheet of Paper like a Cravat, containing his Elogium in great Letters.'1 There was a lawful punishment for scolding women in the ducking stool, of which Gay sings:- I'll speed me to the Pond, where the high Stool On the long Plank hangs o'er the muddy Pool; That Stool, the Dread of every scolding Quean, Yet, sure a Lover should not die so mean.2 The cucking stool is often used as being synonymous with ducking stool, but in reality it is not. The cucking stool is by far the more ancient, and is described in Domesday Book (speaking of Chester) as 'Cathedra Stercoris.' It was a solidly made chair with a hole in the seat, and a rail in front to keep the offender in; and at first the punishment

<pb n="236" id="p.236"/> was confined to exhibition of the scold in front of her house, where, for a certain length of time, she was exposed to the jeers of the neighbourhood. Afterwards it was mounted on wheels, being then called a tumbrel, or trebucket, and moved about the town. It then was improved by ducking the offending woman in some pond; and at last permanent ones were set up in divers towns and villages, as described by Gay, and especially well by Misson, who says: 'The way of punishing Scolding Women is Pleasant enough; They fasten an Arm Chair to the end of two Beams, twelve or fifteen Foot long, and parallel to each other: So that these two Pieces of Wood, with their two Ends, embrace the Chair, which hangs between them upon a Sort of Axel; by which Means it plays freely, and always remains in the natural horizontal Position in which a Chair should be, that a Person may sit Conveniently in it, whether you raise it or let it down. They set up a post upon the Bank of a Pond, or River, and over this Post they lay, almost in Equilibrio, the two Pieces of Wood, at one End of which the Chair hangs just over the Water; they place the Woman in this Chair, and so plunge her into the Water, as often as the Sentence directs, in order to Cool her immoderate Heat.'</p>

It was not that public attention was not called to it. Every writer who touched at all upon the subject was loud in exposing their terrible condition, and the villanies practised in them, without effecting any amelioration in them; and so they continued until the time of Howard. They are a portion of the Social Life of the Reign of Queen Anne, and must be spoken of; but their description must be very modified, as the plain, unvarnished statements made by contemporary writers would not be held as exactly fitting for general perusal in these days.</p>
<p>' A Prison is the Grave of the Living, where they are shut up from the World, and the Worms that gnaw upon them, their own Thoughts, the Jaylor, and their Creditors. A House of Meagre Looks and ill Smells; for Lice, Drink, and Tobacco are the Compound . . . Men huddle up their Life here as a thing of no use, and wear it out like an old Shirt, the faster, the better; and he that deceives the time best, best spends it. It is the Place where Strangers are best Welcomed ; and their Joys are never greater than when they hear of the increase of their miserable Companions, because they are in hopes of a Garnish.

<p>The prisons in London, in their alphabetical order, were as follows: Bridewell; Clerkenwell House of Correction; Clerkenwell New Prison; Counters, or Compters, in the Poultry and Wood Street; Fleet; Gate House, Westminster; Ludgate; Marshalsea; Newgate; Queen's Bench; Westminster House of Correction; and White Lyon Prison, Southwark; besides a sort of prison at Whitechapel, and one exclusively for debtors in the precinct of St. Catharine's Tower-a precinct which had the privilege of freedom of arrest for debt, except by an order of the Board of Green Cloth.</p>
<p>Bridewell, which had originally been a royal residence, was situated between Fleet Ditch and Bride Lane; and 'It is a prison and House of Correction for idle Vagrants, loose and disorderly Servants, Night Walkers, Strumpets &#x0026;c. These are set to hard Labour, and have Correction according to their deserts, but have their Cloaths and Diet during their Imprisonment at the Charge of the House.' <note place="foot" n="2">Hatton's <hi rend="italics">New View of London</hi>, <date value="1708">1708</date>.</note>
</p>

<p>Ward, of course, is in his element in describing Bridewell<note place="foot" n="3"><hi rend="italics">London Spy</hi>.</note>; but his account is not exaggerated. 'We then turn'd into the Gate of a stately Edifice, my Friend told me was <hi rend="italics">Bridewell</hi>, which to me seem'd rather a Prince's Palace, than a House of Correction; till gazing round me, I saw in a large Room a parcel of ill looking Mortals, pounding a Pernicious Weed, which I thought from their unlucky aspects, seem'd to threaten their Destruction. These, said I, to my Friend, I suppose are the Offenders at Work; pray what do you think their Crimes may be ? Truly, said he, I cannot tell you; but if you have a mind to Know, ask any of them their Offence, and they will soon satisfie you. Prithee Friend, said I, to a Surly Bull neck'd fellow, who was thumping as lazily at his Wooden Anvil, as a Ship Carpenter at a Log in the King's Yard at <hi rend="italics">Deptford</hi>, What are you Confin'd to this Labour for ? My Hempen Operator, leering over his shoulder, cast at me one of his hanging Looks, which so frightened me, I step'd back, for fear he should have knocked me on the Head with



<pb n="239" id="p.239"/> his Beetle, Why, Mr. Tickletail, says he, taking me, as I believe, being in Black, for some Country Pedagogue, I was committed hither by Justice Clodpate, for saying I had rather hear a Black bird Whistle <hi rend="italics">Walsingham</hi><note place="foot" n="4">See Appendix.</note>, or a Peacock Scream against Foul Weather, than a Parson talk Nonsense in a Church, or a Fool talk Latin in a Coffee House: And I'll be judg'd by you who are a Man of Judgment, whether in all I said there be one Word of Treason to deserve a Whipping Post.</p>

<p>'The Impudence of this Canary Bird so dash'd me out of Countenance, together with his unexpected Answer, I had nothing to say, but heartily wish'd myself well out of their Company; and, just as we were turning back, to avoid their further Sawciness, another calls out to me, Hark you, Master in Black, of the same colour of the Devil, can you tell me how many thumps of this Hammer will soften the Hemp so as to make a Halter fit Easie, if a man should have occasion to wear one? A third crying out, I hope, Gentlemen, you will be so Generous to give us something to Drink, for you don't know but we may be hard at work for you ? We were glad, with what Expedition we could, to escape their Impudence.</p>
<p>'Going from the Work room to the Common side, or place of Confinement (where they are Lock'd up at Night) through the frightful Grates of which uncomfortable Apartment, a Ghastly Skeleton stood peeping, that from his terrible Aspect, I thought some Power Immortal had imprison'd Death that the World might Live for ever. I could not speak to him without dread of danger, least when his Lips open'd to give me an Answer, he should poison the Air with his Contagious Breath, and Communicate to me the same Pestilence which had brought his infected Body to a dismal Anatomy: Yet mov'd with pity towards so sad an Object, I began to enquire into the Causes of his sad appearance, who, after a Penitential Look, that call'd for Mercy and Compassion, with much difficulty he rais'd his feeble Voice a degree above silence, and told me he had been Sick Six Weeks under that sad Confinement, and had nothing to comfort him but Bread and Water, now and then the refreshment of a little small beer. I asked him further what Offence he had Committed


<pb n="240" id="p.240"/> that brought him under this unhappiness ? To which he answer'd, He had been a great while discharg'd of all that was charg'd against him, and was detain'd only for his Fees, which for want of Friends, being a Stranger in the Town, he was totally unable to raise. I ask'd him what his Fees amounted to; who told me <hi rend="italics">Five Groats</hi>-Bless me! thought I, what a Rigorous, Uncharitable thing is this.</p>
<p>'From thence we turn'd into another Court, the Buildings being like the former, Magnificently Noble; where straight before us was another Grate, which prov'd the Women's Apartments; we follow'd our Noses and Walk'd up to take a View of their Ladies, who we found were shut up as close

<p>'Being now both tired with, and amaz'd at the Confidence and Loose Behaviour of these Degenerate Wretches, who had neither Sense of Grace, Knowledge of Vertue, Fear of Shame, or Dread of Misery, my Friend reconducted me back


<pb n="241" id="p.241"/> into the first Quadrangle, and led me up a pair of Stairs into a spacious Chamber, where the Court was sat in great Grandeur and Order. A Grave Gentleman, whose Awful Looks bespoke him some Honourable Citizen, being mounted in the Judgment Seat, Arm'd with a Hammer, like a Change- Broker at Lloyd's Coffee House-and a Woman under the Lash in the next Room, where Folding Doors were open'd, that the whole Court might view the Punishment; at last down went the Hammer, and the Scourging ceas'd; that I protest, until I was undeceiv'd, I thought they had sold their Lashes by Auction. The Honourable Court, I observ'd was chiefly Attended by Fellows in Blew Coats, and Women in Blew Aprons. Another Accusation being then deliver'd by a Flat Cap against a poor Wench, who having no Friend to speak in her Behalf, Proclamation was made, viz. All you who are willing E-th T--ll should have present Punishment, Pray hold up your Hands; Which was done accordingly; And then she was ordered the Civility of the House, and was forced to shew her tender Back and Breasts to the Sages of the Grave Assembly, who were mov'd by her Modest Mein, together with the whiteness of her Skin, to give her but a gentle Correction.'</p>
<p>The Houses of Correction at Clerkenwell, White Lyon Prison at Southwark, and Westminster, were similar institutions. 'The new prison at Clerkenwell was simply a House of Detention, where the prisoners awaited trial, and was intended to ease Newgate.</p>
<p>Wood Street and Poultry Compters received not only
'debtors upon Actions in the Lord Mayor's and Sheriff's Courts, but such as disturb the Peace of the City in the Night.' Ward describes at considerable length a night spent in the Poultry Counter. He says, 'The Turnkey was so civil to offer us Beds, but upon such unconscionable terms, that we thank'd him for his Love, but refus'd his <hi rend="italics">Courtesie</hi>.' Afterwards he was put in the <hi rend="italics">Common side</hi> of the prison, and this is what it was like. 'When first we enter'd this Apartment, under the Title of the <hi rend="italics">King's Ward</hi>, the mixtures of Scents that arose from <hi rend="italics">Mundungus-Tobacco</hi>, foul Sweaty <hi rend="italics">Toes</hi>, Dirty

The Ill looking Vermin, with long Rusty Beards swaddled up in Rags, and their heads, some cover'd with Thrum Caps, and others thrust into the tops of old Stockings; some quitted their Play they were before engag'd in, and came hovering round us, like so many <hi rend="italics">Canibals</hi>, with such devouring <hi rend="italics">Countenances</hi>, as if a Man had been but a Morsel with 'em all crying out <hi rend="italics">Garnish, Garnish</hi>, as a Rabble in an Insurrection, crying <hi rend="italics">Liberty, Liberty</hi>.

Having thus Paid our Initiation Fees, we were bid Welcome into the <hi rend="italics">King's Ward</hi>, and to all the Privileges and Immunities thereof.'</p>
<p>We will not follow Ward through his night's experiences, which are far too graphically told-but in the morning, he says, ' Now I must confess, I was forc'd to hold my Nose to the Grate, and Snuff hard for a little fresh Air; for I was e'en choak'd with the unwholesome Fumes that arose from their uncleanly Carcasses: Were the Burning of Old Shoes, Draymen's Stockings, the Dipping Card Matches, and a full Close Stool Pan, to be prepared in one Room, as a Nosegay to torment my Nostrils, it could not have prov'd a more effectual Punishment.'</p>

<p>'Those Scholars that come here have nothing to depend on but the Charity of the Foundation, in which Side very exact Rules are observ'd; for as soon as a Prisoner comes into the Turn Key's Hands Three Knocks are given at the Stair Foot, as a Signal a Collegian is coming up; which Harmony makes those <hi rend="italics">Convicts</hi> that stand for the <hi rend="italics">Garnish</hi> as joyful as One Knock, the Signal of the <hi rend="italics">Baker's</hi> coming every Morning, does those poor Prisoners, who, for want of Friends, have nothing else to Subsist on but Bread and Water: And no sooner are the Three Strokes given, but out jumps Four Trunchion Officers from their Hovel, and with a sort of ill mannerly Reverence receive him at the Grate; then taking him into their Apartment, a couple of the good natured

<pb n="244" id="p.244"/> Sparks hold him whilst the other Two pick his Pockets, claiming Six Pence apiece, as a Priviledge, belonging to their Office; then they turn him out to the <hi rend="italics">Convicts</hi>, who hover about him for <hi rend="italics">Garnish</hi>, which is Six Shillings and Eight pence, which they, from an old Custom, claim by Prescription Time out of Mind for entring in the <hi rend="italics">Society</hi>, otherwise they strip the poor Wretch, if he has not wherewithal to pay it.</p>
<p>'Then <hi rend="italics">Cook Ruffian</hi> comes to him for Three pence for dressing the Charity Meat, which charitable disposed Persons send in every <hi rend="italics">Thursday</hi>, whereon Earthen Dishes, Porringers, Pans, Wooden Spoons, and Cabbage Nets, are Stirring about against Dinner Time, whilst the Cook sweats in Porriging the Prisoners, who stand round him like so many poor Scholars begging at the Kitchin Door for College Broth.</p>
<p>'But yet the caged Person is not clear of his Dues, for next, Two other Officers, who have a Patent for being
<hi rend="italics">Swabbers</hi>, demand Three Half pence apiece more for clearing the Gaol of its Filth, which requires the Labour of <hi rend="italics">Sisiphus</hi>, and is never to be ended. Then at the signal of the <hi rend="italics">Grey Pease</hi> Woman, which is between Seven and Eight, he is conducted down Stairs, with an Illumination of Links, to his Lodging, and, provided he has a Shilling for Money, may lye in the <hi rend="italics">Middle Ward</hi>, which (to give the Devils their due) is kept very neat and clean, where he pays One Shilling and Four Pence more to his Comrades, and then he is Free of the
<hi rend="italics">College</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Matriculated</hi>.'</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italics">Lower Ward</hi> was a shocking place, as was also a
'large Room call'd <hi rend="italics">Tangier</hi>, which next to the <hi rend="italics">Lower Ward</hi>, is the nastiest place in the Gaol. The Miserable Inhabitants hereof are Debtors.' There was a large room, called <hi rend="italics">High Hall</hi>, for recreation, and a cellar where liquors were sold, in unlimited quantities, to moneyed prisoners. We can imagine the effects of drink among this depraved lot, and the fearful brawls and fights that took place; but, were the riot very serious, then two pulls of the big bell, which hung over the
<hi rend="italics">High Hall</hi> stairs, would bring the turnkeys, who stood no nonsense among that unruly crew, and the ringleaders were ironed and thrown into dark dungeons.</p>
<p>The press-room, where non-pleading criminals were


<pb n="245" id="p.245"/> pressed, and a room where the hangman seethed the quartered limbs of rebels and traitors in a mixture of pitch, tar, and oil, were among the apartments in Newgate. When the fettered prisoners were tried, if they did not give the gaolers half a crown to be put in the <hi rend="italics">Bail Dock</hi>, they were put, men and women together, into the <hi rend="italics">Hold</hi>, where a singular custom prevailed of a prisoner exacting a shilling apiece from the youngest for <hi rend="italics">Hold Money</hi>; and were any one lucky enough to be acquitted, he had to spend a <hi rend="italics">Quit Shilling</hi> for their delight.</p>
<p>Of the Marshalsea Prison Hatton says: 'It is now the County Gaol for Felons, the Admiralty Gaol for Piracy and other Offences committed at Sea, and is the Gaol to the Marshals court for Debt and Damage.' It was in Southwark; and another contemporary<note place="foot" n="6">Smith's <hi rend="italics">Lives of Highwaymen</hi>.</note> says it 'is situated on such a Cursed Piece of Land, that the Son is asham'd to be his Father's Heir in't. It is an infected Pest house all the Year long; and <hi rend="italics">Lord have Mercy upon us</hi> may well stand upon these Doors.'</p>
<p>The Gate House, Westminster, 'is the chief Prison for the City of <hi rend="italics">Westminster</hi> Liberties, not only for Debt but Treason, Theft and other Criminal Matters; the Keeper has that place by Lease from the Dean and Chapter of <hi rend="italics">Westminster</hi>.'</p>
<p>The Queen's Bench Prison had 'its Rules of a considerable Extent and Allowance, somewhat better than in the Common Gaols, for which reason many Debtors elsewhere confin'd, do by <hi rend="italics">Habeas Corpus</hi> remove into this Prison, which is the proper place of Confinement in all Cases tryable in the
<hi rend="italics">Queen's Bench Court</hi>, whether for Debt, Dammage, Treason, Murther, &#x0026;c.'</p>
<p>The Fleet and Ludgate were purely for debtors, in contradistinction to the others, which accommodated not only debtors but criminals. Imprisonment for debt has not very long been done away with-indeed, it now exists, under the name of 'contempt of court'; and what renders it more illogical and oppressive, is that people can only be imprisoned for owing small sums, the debtors who operate on a larger scale having perfect immunity from restraint. However, in

<pb n="246" id="p.246"/> Anne's time large and small were taken indiscriminately; the smaller debtors, as being the weaker, naturally getting the worst of it; their chances of ever getting out being very remote. We have seen in Newgate that <hi rend="italics">Tangier</hi> was the worst place but one in the gaol. 'The Miserable Inhabitants hereof are <hi rend="italics">Debtors</hi>, who put what sorry Bedding they enjoy upon such an Ascent where Soldiers lye when on Guard at the <hi rend="italics">Tilt Yard</hi>. But in this Apartment lye, besides <hi rend="italics">real Debtors</hi>, such as are call'd your <hi rend="italics">Thieving Debtors</hi>; who, having for <hi rend="italics">Theft</hi> satisfy'd the <hi rend="italics">Queen</hi>, by being Burnt in the Face, or Whipt, which is no Satisfaction to the wrong'd Subject, their Adversaries bring an Action of <hi rend="italics">Trover</hi> against them, and keep them there till they make Restitution for Things stolen. . . here is a lightsome Room call'd <hi rend="italics">Debtors' Hall</hi>, so nam'd from such unfortunate Men lying there, where every Man shews like so many Wrecks upon the Sea; here the Ribs of &#x00A3;20, here the Ruins of a good Estate, Doublets, without Buttons, and a Gown without Sleeves; and a pair of Stairs higher lye Women that are <hi rend="italics">Fines</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Debtors</hi>, thinking like their suffering Companions below them, every Year Seven till they get abroad.'<note place="foot" n="7"><hi rend="italics">Hall's Memoirs</hi>.</note></p>
<p>The Warden of the Fleet must have made a good thing out of the necessities of his victims. If they had any money at all, he got it out of them. If their nature revolted at the moral and actual filth of the <hi rend="italics">Common Side</hi>, they could rent a small room of him, the lowest price being about 8s. per week. This accommodation entailed paying besides is. <hi rend="italics">6d</hi>. a week to the chamberlain, and a double fee of <hi rend="italics">4d</hi>. to the chaplain. 'There are some who lie on the <hi rend="italics">Common Side</hi>, or
<hi rend="italics">Wards</hi>, without Beds allowed to them, who pay but 1s. 2d. per week, and 34s. 4d. Commitment Fee, and 2d. per week to the Parson; but that place in the <hi rend="italics">Fleet</hi> is Dark, Unwholesome, and is a Curb upon the rest to pay those Great Rates the Gaoler Exacts; he unmercifully threatning all for <hi rend="italics">Non Payment</hi>, with Dungeons and Irons, not distinguishing between a Criminal and a Debtor.'</p>
<p>Ludgate was more comfortable, and rather more aristocratic; it was 'purely for Insolvent Citizens of <hi rend="italics">London</hi>,

<pb n="247" id="p.247"/>
 Beneficed Clergy, and Attorneys at Law. Fees at Coming in from the Counter-1s. 2d.; at going out-3s. 2d.; and to the Turnkey-1s. For their being here they pay on the Commons Side 1s. 2d. per Week, and on the Master's side-
1s. 9d. They have among the Prisoners a sort of Government, as a Steward chosen the 1st Tuesday in every Month; also 7 Assistants.'<note place="foot" n="8"><hi rend="italics">New View of London.</hi></note></p>
<p>But both here and at the Fleet, in spite of charitable bequests, there were some of the prisoners in a state of absolute destitution. To aid these, the prisoners took it in turns to perambulate the rules, and solicit help in money or kind, whilst another had to stand at the window-grating, rattling a box, and chanting the monotonous wail of 'Pray remember the poor Debtors !'</p>
<p>' Passing under <hi rend="italics">Ludgate</hi>, the other Day, I heard a Voice bawling for Charity, which I thought I had somewhere heard before. Coming near to the Grate, the Prisoner called me by my Name, and desired I would throw something into the Box. I was out of Countenance for him, and did as he bid me, by putting in half-a-Crown.'<note place="foot" n="9"><hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>, 82.</note></p>

<p><figure id="fig.00030" n="tufts:central:dca:MS004:MS004.002.006.DO01.00030"><head>'Remember the Poor Prisoners'</head> </figure></p>
<p>Once in a debtors' prison, almost all hope had to be given up-even the release offered by Government on condition of joining the army or navy was limited to debtors of small amount, who must have been six months in prison; and, besides, it was only going to other privations, and, in the army, almost certainly meant wounds or death. No wonder, then, if, when a man was in difficulties, he sometimes adopted the desperate resource of selling himself for a time in bondage to one of the Plantations. Poor wretch! he knew it was bad to do so, by common report; but he had to find out what the life of a 'Redemptioner' really was, by bitter experience.


<pb n="248" id="p.248"/> First, a little money advanced for his outfit; then, on his arrival at his destination, his body would be seized for his passage money, which had been promised him free; and then he must be sold to Work for so many years, to some one who paid his debt for him. Put on the same footing, as to food and government, with the convicts, his life was awful, whilst his master always managed to keep him sufficiently in debt for clothes and tobacco, &#x0026;c., so that he never could free himself.</p>
<p>Men were ever on the prowl, about London, to catch the miserable. 'Those fine Fellows who look like Foot men upon a Holy day, crept into cast Suits of their Masters, that want Gentility in their Deportments answerable to their Apparel, are Kidnappers, who walk the Change, and other parts of the Town, in order to Seduce People, who want Services, and young Fools crost in Love, and under an uneasiness of Mind, to go beyond Seas, getting so much a head of Masters of Ships, and Merchants who go over, for every Wretch they trapan into this Misery. Those Young Rakes, and Tatterdemallions you see so lovingly herded, are drawn by their fair Promises to sell themselves into Slavery, and the Kidnappers are the Rogues that run away with the Money.<note place="foot" n="10"><hi rend="italics">London Spy</hi>.</note></p>

<p>Bad as the prisons where debtors were confined were in London, they were infinitely worse in the country; indeed, one can scarcely credit the treatment they received. There is, however, a most interesting little book, called 'The Cry of the Oppressed,' which goes minutely into the details in many of the country prisons, and the engravings alone show the cruel treatment debtors had to endure: catching mice for subsistence; being dragged on hurdles, dying of starvation and malaria; covered with boils and blains; imprisoned in underground dungeons; assaulted by the gaolers; having to live with the hogs, with wooden clogs chained to their legs; having to herd with condemned criminals; and being tortured with thumbscrews, etc.</p>
<p>Nobody ever seems to have bothered their heads about itit was not their business. Luttrell says,' 3 Nov., <date value="1702">1702</date>. This

<pb n="249" id="p.249"/> day ordered a Bill to be brought in for regulating the 'King's Bench and Fleet Prisons,' but nobody took sufficient interest in it, and it never became an Act.</p>
<p>Arrest for debt was so common in those days that we find that even the sacred person of an ambassador was not exempt. ' Saturday, 24 July, <date value="1708">1708</date>. Thursday, the Muscovite envoy, who is leaving this kingdom, was arrested in his Coach in the Haymarket for a debt of &#x00A3;360, which he has since paid, but complained to her Majestie of the affront, who ordered the officers to be prosecuted, and promised him all possible satisfaction. 27 Jul. The Queen has ordered the persons who caused the Muscovite ambassador to be arrested to beg his pardon upon their knees.'<note place="foot" n="11"><hi rend="italics">Luttrell's Diary</hi>.</note></p>

<p>In the <hi rend="italics">Daily Courant</hi>, Oct. 11, <date value="1705">1705</date>, is a most pathetic appeal from a bankrupt to his creditors. 'To the Creditors of James Folkingham, late of London, Merchant. The Mottos of Sic transit Gloria Mundi, and Hodie mihi, cras tibi, have been frequently made use of to express the uncertainty of Humane Affairs in all their Divisions, even from the greatest Monarch, to the Meanest Peasant, so I may occasionally lay Claim to them. This premised, I shall not entertain you Gentlemen, my Creditors, with the Number, Variety, and Severity of my Misfortunes, nor how far my folly, want of Judgment, Inadvertency, &#x0026;c. may have contributed thereto; but rather plead Guilty to the Indictment of having Injured you, unwillingly, of a great deal of Money, and my own near Relations of as much, and throw myself on your Mercy; in order to entitule me to which, I promise upon Oath to resign all I have, and shall be required by the Persons deputed, directly or indirectly; provided I may be forthwith set at Liberty, with a Security not to be molested hereafter. That my all is no more, is matter of Concern to me, as well as Disappointment to you. If God Almighty ever permit me to be able, my generous, honest Temper will oblige me to make you farther Satisfaction, for to Digg I will endeavour, tho' to Begg I am ashamed.

<p>In one case, that of Thomas Pitkin, a bankrupt linen draper, who absconded, an Act of Parliament (3 and 4 Anne, cap. 11 ) was passed for the relief of his creditors, and for his apprehension, and he was afterwards captured at Breda in Holland.</p>

The children, who were either vagrants or parish children, were taught spinning wool and flax, sewing, knitting, winding silk, and making their clothes and shoes; but they also received some elementary instruction in reading, writing, and arithmetic. Hatton thus gives the daily life of these little ones: 'The Bell rings at 6 a Clock in the Morning to call up the Children, and half an Hour after, the Bell is rung for Prayers, and Breakfast; at
7 the Children are set to work; 20 under a Mistress to spin Wool and Flax, to Knit Stockings, to wind Silk, to make and Sew their Linen, Cloaths, Shooes, Mark &#x0026;c. All the Children are called down for an Hour every Day to Read, and an Hour every day to Write (<hi rend="italics">viz</hi>.) 20 at a time.</p>
<p>'At 12 a Clock they go to Dinner, and have a little time to play till One, then they are set to work again till 6 a clock: They are rung to Prayers, to their Supper, and allowed to play till Bed time.</p>
<p>'Every Nurse combs her Children with a small tooth comb 3 times a Week; mends the Children's Cloaths; makes their beds, washes their Wards; and sees that the children go neat and clean, and that they wash and comb themselves every day.</p>

<pb n="252" id="p.252"/>
<p>'Some Children earn a 1/2d., some 1d. and some 4d. per day.</p>
<p>'The Children are taught their Catechism, and often Catechised by the Minister, especially every Sunday.</p>
<p>'When Children are grown up to 12, 13 or 14 years of Age they are put forth Apprentices to Masters of Ships, and other Sea faring Men, and to Handycraft Trades and others, and the Governors give with them a good ordinary Suit of Cloaths or 20s. in Money at the Election of the Master or Mistress.</p>

<p>The hospitals, in the modern acceptation of the word, were Bethlehem, or Bedlam, St. Bartholomew's, and St. Thomas's--Guy's not having yet been founded.</p>
<p>Of Bethlehem Hatton says: 'It was formerly a mean House situate between the E. side of Moor-fields, and Bishopsgate Street. . . . This Hospital for poor distracted Persons, growing Old and Ruinous, and too small to accommodate so great numbers, for whom Applications were made; the City of London granted to the Governours of the said Hospital, Ground on the S. Side of Moor-fields (a Situation much more Commodious as to Air &#x0026;c.) for the benefit of Lunatick Persons, and in the year <date value="1675">1675</date>, the present spacious Structure was begun to be erected, which was finished Anno <date value="1676">1676</date>, being well built of Brick and Stone, the Wings at both ends and the Portico, being all adorned with each 4 pilasters,' etc.
-'and on a Pediment over the Gate are the Figures of 2 Lunaticks curiously Carved.' These figures, which are now in the hall of Bethlehem Hospital, represent Raving and Melancholy Madness, and were the work of Caius Gabriel Cibber
(father of the celebrated Colley Cibber). They are carved in Portland stone, and one of them was the portrait of Oliver Cromwell's porter, then in Bedlam.</p>
<p>In Anne's time it was not overcrowded. 'Distracted persons who went out cured in the Year ending at <hi rend="italics">Easter</hi>
<date value="1707">1707</date>-59; buried in that time 24. Brought into the Hospital
             <pb id="p.253" n="253"/> in <date value="1706">1706</date>-82-and remaining at <hi rend="italics">Easter</hi> aforesaid in this Hospital under Cure, 142.'</p>
<p>'The Method of receiving, continuing and curing Lunaticks in this Hospital is. When any Person is minded to get a Friend or Relation into the Hospital, it must be by Petition to the Committee who sit at <hi rend="italics">Bethlehem</hi> 7 at a time weekly; this must be signed by the Church Wardens or other reputable Persons who know the Lunatick, and also recommended to the said Committee by one of the Governours; and this being approved by the President and Governours, and enter'd in a Book, upon a vacancy (in their turn) an Order is granted for their being received into the House, where the said Lunatick is accommodated with a Room in a good Air, proper Physick, and Diet Gratis. The Diet is very good and wholesome, being commonly boyled Beef, Mutton or Veal and Broth with Bread for Dinners on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, the other Days, Bread, Cheese and Butter, or on Saturdays Peas, Pottage, Rice Milk, Fermity or other Pottage; and for Suppers they have usually Broth or Milk Pottage, always with Bread; and there is this farther care taken, that some of the Committee go weekly to the said Hospital to see the Provisions weighed, and that the same be good and rightly expended.</p>
<p>'There is also care taken, That no distracted Person be abused by the Servants of the House &#x0026;c.; the Men Servants of the House attend the Lunatick Men, and the Women Servants the Women, and no loose Person or Apprentice is suffered to loyter away the time in this Hospital, nor any Person to be admitted to come or stay in (as a Spectator) after Sun Setting; and the Servants are particularly enjoyned to keep good Hours.'</p>
<p>This looks admirable, <hi rend="italics">on paper</hi>-but, practically, it was the reverse. It ranked, as we know, with the Lions and Westminster Abbey, as one of the principal sights of London. Ward describes a visit: 'Accordingly we were admitted in thro' an Iron gate, within which sat a Brawny <hi rend="italics">Cerberus</hi> of an Indico Colour, leaning upon a Money box; we turned in thro' another Iron Barricado, where we heard such a rattling of <hi rend="italics">Chains</hi>, drumming of <hi rend="italics">Doors, Ranting, Hollowing, Singing</hi>

<pb n="254" id="p.254"/> and <hi rend="italics">Running</hi> that I could think of nothing but Don <hi rend="italics">Quevedo</hi>'s Vision, where the Damn'd broke loose, and put Hell in an Uproar.' He describes the lunatics as being filthy in their persons, their habits, and their conversation, and the visitors as no better than they ought to be: ''tis a new Whetstone's Park<note place="foot" n="12">A narrow alley leading from Lincoln's Inn Fields to Holborn.</note> -now the old one's Plough'd up, where a Sportsman at any Hour in the Day may meet with Game for his Purpose.' So he and his friend 'redeemed their Liberties from this Prison, at the Expence of Two Pence'-and went away.</p>
<p>There were the names of good men on the List of Governors-take that for <date value="1711">1711</date>, for instance. All the aldermen were so, <hi rend="italics">ex officio</hi>, and there were the Earls of Abingdon, Anglesea, Ailesford, Lords Craven, Gower, Harcourt, and St. John of Bletsoe; the Earl of Scarsdale, Doctor <hi rend="italics">Jonathan Swift</hi>, Dean of St. Patrick. The Earl of Thanet and Sir Philip York, the Attorney-General.</p>

<p>Of St. Bartholomew's Hospital Hatton says:-
<table rows="3" cols="2"><row role="data"><cell>This Hospital of St. Bartholomew's, the last Year <date value="1706">1706</date> cur'd and discharg'd of wounded, sick and maimed Souldiers, Seamen, and other diseased Persons from several Parts of the Queen's Dominions (and from Foreign Parts) who have been relieved with Money and other Necessaries, notwithstanding the greatest part of the Revenue of this Hospital was consumed by the lamentable Flames in <date value="1666">1666</date> to the Number of</cell><cell>2293</cell></row>

It performed its share of merciful work, for in <date value="1706">1706</date> it discharged (cured) 2,820 persons, buried 174, and had 362 in hospital.</p>
<p>Of almshouses there were plenty in existence, such as the Trinity, those of the different City companies, and of private benefactors; but the stream of charity seems to have flowed, in this reign, in a different channel, that of founding charity schools, and I can find no new almshouses recorded.</p>

<p>SIR ROGER DE COVERLEY.</p>
<p>In Chappell's 'Popular Music of the Olden Time,' the oldest account of this tune is given as follows: According to Ralph Thoresby's MS. account of the family of Calverley, of Calverley in Yorkshire, the dance of <hi rend="italics">Roger de Coverley</hi> was named after a knight who lived in the reign of Richard I. Thoresby was born in <date value="1658">1658</date>. The following extract was communicated to Notes and Queries, vol. 1, p. 369, by Sir Walter Calverley Trevelyan, Bart. :-Roger, so named from the Archbishop (of York), was a person of renowned hospitality, since, at his day, <hi rend="italics">the obsolete known tune of Roger a Calverley</hi> is referred to him, who, according to the custom of those times, kept his Minstrels, from that their Office, named Harpers, which became a family, and possessed lands till late Years, in and about Calverley, called to this Day Harper's roids and Harper's Spring.'</p>
<p>The earliest authentic notice I can find of it is in a very curious old tract, printed in the year <date value="1648">1648</date>, or ten years before Thoresby was born, called 'A Vindication or justification of John Griffith, Esq., against the horrid, malitious, and unconscionable Verdict of Coroner's Jury in Cheshire: which was packt by means of that Pocky, Rotten, Lying Cowardly and most perfidious knave, Sir Hugh Caulverley Knight, onely to vent his inveterate Hatred and Malice against me.' And, on page 5, Mr. Griffiths says: 'I purposely to vex Sir Hugh, and his Champion Dod, sent for a fidler, and during the time my fellow Coursers were drinking a Cup of Ale, we having run our Match, I and my Fidler, rid

                   <pb id="p.269" n="269"/> up to Sayton, and from one end of the town to the other, I made the Fidler play a tune called Roger of Caulverley: This I did to shew, that I did not fear to be disarmed by them, and they may thank themselves for it, for if they had not first endeavoured to mischief me, I should not trouble myself to have vext them.'</p>

<p>Wednesday, March 11,  <date value="1702">1702</date>.</p>
<p>From the Harlem Courant, Dated March 18, N. S.</p>
<p>Naples, Feb. 22</p>
<p>ON Wednesday last, our New Viceroy, the Duke of Escalona, arriv'd here with a Squadron of the Galleys of Sicily. He made his Entrance drest in a French habit; and to give us the greater Hopes of the King's coming hither, went to Lodge in one of the little Palaces, leaving the Royal one for his Majesty. The Marquis of Grigni is also arriv'd here with a Regiment of French.</p>
<p>Rome, Feb.25. In a Military Congregation of State that was held here, it was Resolv'd to draw a Line from Ascoli to the Borders of the Ecclesiastical State, thereby to hinder the Incursions of the Transalpine Troops. Orders are sent to Civita Vecchia to fit out the Galleys, and to strengthen the Garrison of that Place. Signior Casali is made Governor of Perugia. The Marquis del Vasto, and the Prince de Caferta continue still in the Imperial Embassador's Palace; where his Excellency has a Guard of 50 Men every Night in Arms. The King of Portugal has desir'd the Arch-Bishoprick of Lisbon, vacant by the Death of Cardinal Sousa, for the Infante his second Son, who is about 11 Years old.</p>
<p>Vienna, Mar. 4. Orders are sent to the 4 Regiments of Foot, the 2 of Cuirassiers, and to that of Dragoons, which are broke up from Hungary, and are on their way to Italy, and which consist of about
14 or <date value="1500">1500</date>0 Men, to hasten their March thither with all Expedition. The 6 new Regiments of Hussars that are now raising, are in so great a forwardness, that they will be compleat, and in a Condition to march by the middle of May. Prince Lewis of Baden has written to Court, to excuse himself from coming thither, his Presence being so very necessary, and so much desir'd on the Upper-Rhine.</p>
<p>Francfort, Mar. 12. The Marquiss d' Uxelles is come to Strasburg, and is to draw together a Body of some Regiments of Horse and Foot from the Garisons of Alsace; but will not lessen those of Strasburg and Landau, which are already very weak. On the other hand, the Troops of His Imperial Majesty, and his Allies, are going to form a Body near Germeshein in the Palatinate, of which Place as well as of the Lines at Spires, Prince Lewis of Baden is expected to take a View, in three or four days. The English and Dutch Ministers,the Count of Frise, and the Baron Vander Meer; and likewise the Imperial Envoy Count Lowenstein, are gone to Nordsingen, and it is hop'd that in a short time we shall hear from thence of some favourable Resolutions for the Security of the Empire.</p>
<p>Liege, Mar. 14. The French have taken the Cannon de Longie, who was Secretary to the Dean de Mean, out of our Castle, where he has been for some time a Prisoner, and have deliver'd him to the Pro. vost of Maubeuge, who has carry'd him from hence, but we do not know whither.</p>
<p>Paris, Mar. 13. Our Letters from Italy say, That most of our Reinforcements were Landed there; that the Imperial and Ecclesiastical Troops seem to live very peaceably with one another in the Country of Parma, and that the Duke of Vendome, as he was visiting several Posts was within 100 Paces of falling into the Hands of the Germans. The Duke of Chartres, the Prince of Conti, and several other Princes of the Blood, are to make the Campaign in Flanders under the Duke of Burgundy; and the Duke of Maine is to Command upon the Rhine.</p>
<p>From the Amsterdam Courant, Dated Mar. 18.</p>
<p>Rome, Feb. 25. We are taking here all possible Precautions for the Security of the Ecclesiastical State in this present Conjuncture, and have desir'd to raise
<date value="3000">3000</date> Men in the Cantons of Switzerland. The Pope has appointed the Duke of Berwick to be his Lieutenant-General, and he is to Command <date value="6000">6000</date> Men on the Frontiers of Naples: He has also settled upon him a Pension of <date value="6000">6000</date> Crowns a year during Life.</p>
<p>From the Paris Gazette, Dated Mar. 18. <date value="1702">1702</date>.</p>
<p>Naples, Febr. 17. 600 French Soldiers are arrived here, and are expected to be followed by <date value="3400">3400</date> more. A Courier that came hither on the 14th. has brought Letters by which we are assur'd that the King of Spain designs to be here towards the end of March; and accordingly Orders are given to make the necessary Preparations against his Arrival. The two Troops of Horse that were Commanded to the Abruzzo are posted at Pescara with a Body of Spanish Foot, and others in the Fort of Montorio.</p>
<p>Paris, March. 18. We have Advice from Toulon of the 5th instant, that the Wind having long stood favourable, <date value="2200">2200</date>0 Men were already sailed for Italy, that <date value="2500">2500</date> more were Embarking, and that by the
15th it was hoped they might all get thither. The Count d' Estrees arriv'd there on' the Third instant, and set all hands at work to fit out the Squadren of 9 Men of War and some Fregats, that are appointed to carry the, King of Spain to Naples. His Catholick Majesty will go on Board the Thunderer, of 110 Guns.</p>
<p>We have Advice by an Express from Rome of the
18th of February, That notwithstanding the pressing Instances of the Imperial Embassadour, the Pope had Condemn'd the Marquis del Vasto to lose his Head and his Estate to be confiscated, for not appearing to Answer the Charge against him of Publickly Scandalizing Cardinal Janson.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT.</p>
<p>IT will be found from the Foreign Prints, which from time to time, as Occasion offers, will be mentioned in this Paper, that the Author has taken Care to be duly furnish'd with all that comes from Abroad in any Language. And for an Assurance that he will not, under Pretence of having Private Intelligence, impose any Additions of feign'd Circumstances to an Action, but give his Extracts fairly and Impartially; at the beginning of each Article he will quote the Foreign Paper from whence 'tis taken, that the Publick, seeing from what Country a piece of News comes with the Allowance of that Government, may be better able to Judge of the Credibility and Fairness of the Relation : Nor will he take upon him to give any Comments or Conjectures of his own, but will relate only Matter of Fact; supposing other People to have Sense enough to make Reflctions for themselves.</p>
<p>This Courant (as the Title shews) will be Publish'd Daily; being design'd to give all the Material News as soon as every  Post arrives: and is confined to half the Compass, to save the Publick at least half the Impertinences of  ordinary News-Papers.</p>
<p>L0ND0N. Sold by E. Mallet, next Door to the King's Arms Tavern at Fleet-Bridge.</p>

Illustrated in Colours by VIOLA BOUGHTON. This sumptuous and elegant Birthday Book is the first in which our floral treasures have been laid under really effective contribution. It has been produced at immense cost, and in it we have one of the most accurate and beautiful Masterpieces of Chromo-lithography yet issued from the press. Within its sixty-four fully-coloured pages, each lithographed in fourteen printings, we have a noble Series of lovely Bouquets, depicting in all their wealth of grace and beauty the most famous of our field and garden jewels; and a different flower is taken for every day in the year, so that there are no fewer than three hundred and sixty-six separate selections. The legends and the sentiments ascribed to each of the chosen blossoms have formed the theme of some fifteen hundred lines of Original Verse, and there is thus given one of the fullest
"Languages of Flowers" in existence, and the only one which is free from duplicates. An unusual amount of thought and labour has been expended on the work, and the publishers congratulate themselves that in a literary and artistic sense the result has been fully commensurate thereto. Such a collection of flowers, so complete and compact, has never been offered before. As a Book of Birthdays and Family Records it is unsurpassed. The addition of the scientific names to the minutely accurate delineations of plants renders its pages invaluable to the botanist and every lover of leaf and bloom. The legends which form the burden of its verse will delight the scholar and archaeologist and every student of song and folk-lore; while the copious floral meanings, completer than in any other " language of flowers " yet available, will render it the constant companion and most treasured gift of a much more numerous section of the community-the whole world of Sweethearts of the English-speaking nations.

"The illustrations of this volume . . . are of quite sterling and admirable art, of a class precisely parallel in elevation to the character of the tales which they illustrate; and the original etchings, as I have before said in the Appendix to my 'Elements of Drawing,' were unrivalled in masterfulness of touch since Rembrandt (in some qualities of delineation, unrivalled even by him). . . . To make somewhat enlarged copies of them. looking at them through a magnifying glass, and never putting two lines where Cruikshank has put only one, would be an exercise in decision and severe drawing which would leave afterwards little to be learnt in schools."-Extract from Introduction by JOHN RUSKIN.</p>
