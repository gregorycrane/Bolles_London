<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>WHOEVER would grapple with the Problems of a Great
City, must bear the burden of a heavy heart. The nature
of the task, the failure of bygone efforts, the apathy of
the comfortable classes, discourage fresh attempts to set
forth remedies for evils visible to all. Any contribution,
however, towards the settlement of the Social question,
if prepared thoughtfully and with labour, and presented
with a humble sense of inherent deficiencies, may
perhaps be accepted as an instalment of the solution Society
itself alone can apply.

<head>CHAPTER I: The Whited Wall</head><head type="sub">
THE WHITED WALL.</head>
<p>INHABITANTS of the British Islands are
prone to plume themselves on the spectacle
they present to gods and men. It is,
nevertheless, a question whether the texture of
British civilization is sufficiently tough to
stand examination; or whether the
organization of society will compare with the sociology
of certain among the Himalayan tribes, or with
the Basuto, Zulu, or Amatonga nations, upon
whose conversion we are annually wont to lay
out a portion of our savings. Such is the
falling off from the ideal set forth in the Sermon
on the. Mount, that our thirty-eight millions of

<pb id="p.2" n="2"/>
nominal Christians are not only no better,
but, in certain characteristics, are distinctly
inferior to a like number of Buddhists or
Mahommedans. Drunkenness and pauperism,
organized villainy, secret crimes, adulteration,
fraud and cruelty in England are perpetrated
with a lustiness and resolve foreign to the
Asiatic mind.  It is true that certain forms of
vice are more perfectly developed in Asia
than in England.  But it is no less true that
Eastern society is free from the taint of
organized hypocrisy which, in our own case,
drugs the national conscience, if it do not
impose on the public opinion of the rest of
mankind.</p>
<p>In the books of the three <title>Pitakas</title> a code
of ethics is laid down which finds no followers
in practice. The ideal is unattainable. The
motive for sacrifice is of phantom-fabric.  It
exists only in theory.
The beatitudes of <persName key="Gautama">Gautama</persName> are not well
known, and they are less followed.<quote rend="blockquote">
Not to serve the foolish,
But to serve the wise;
To honour those worthy of honour:
This is the greatest blessing.

<pb id="p.3" n="3"/>
To dwell in a pleasant land,
Good works done in a former birth,
Right desires in the heart:
This is the greatest blessing.
Much insight and education,
Self-control and pleasant speech,
And whatever word be well spoken:
This is the greatest blessing.
To support father and mother,
To cherish wife and child,
To follow a peaceful calling:
This is the greatest blessing,
To bestow alms and live righteously,
To give help to kindred,
Deeds which cannot be blamed:
These are the greatest blessing.
To abhor, and cease from sin,
Abstinence from strong drink,
Not to be weary in well doing,
These are the greatest blessing.
Reverence and lowliness,
Contentment and gratitude,
The hearing of the Law at due seasons,
This is the greatest blessing.
To be long-suffering and meek,
To associate with the tranquil
Religious talk at due seasons,
This is the greatest blessing.

<pb id="p.4" n="4"/>
Self-restraint and purity,
The knowledge of the Noble Truths,
The realization of Nirvana,
This is the greatest blessing.
Beneath the stroke of life's changes,
The mind that shaketh not,
Without grief or passion, and secure,
This is the greatest blessing.
On every side are invincible,
They who do acts like these,
On every side they walk in safety,
And theirs is the greatest blessing.</quote></p>
<p>As a necessary result of the contrast
between profession and practice it is found that
when the conventional Buddhist encounters
reverses, or confronts a serious crisis in his
life, he abandons the philosophy of Gautama,
and betakes himself, under the storm of
necessity, to the establishment of relations with
the powers of evil.</p>
<p>Not otherwise is the method of the
conventional Christian of the West.     The lives and
characters of the main body of those who
assert, and of those who professionally explain
the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount,
are a strange study to an orthodox Moslem or
pious Hindoo. With an assured income, proceeding

<pb id="p.5" n="5"/>
 from safe investments returning four
and a quarter per cent., it is difficult for a
prosperous Christian to be poor in spirit.  He is
neither reviled nor persecuted. So far from any
man saying all manner of evil against him for
Christ's sake, the reputation of "goodness"
carries with it a professional advantage. To
be accounted as an "earnest" man; to occupy
a seat on the <orgName key="Board of a Foreign Missionary
Society">oard of a Foreign Missionary
Society</orgName>; to hold views on the sanctity of the
Sabbath; to be the author of a luscious hymn,
are proved methods of mundane
advancement. To agree with his adversary quickly,
is an archaic form of stating the advantages
of compromise.</p>
<p>The struggling trader finds it a harder
matter to maintain the ideal of the Mount.
Discounts and drawbacks, the relation of
samples to deliveries, the statements of
advertisements, the representations of
commercial travellers, and the exigencies of
competition, and of the adulteration which Mr.
Bright holds to be one of the forms of
competition, place him in a position of strained
relations with the Socialism of his Teacher.
</p><p>Difficulties, all but insuperable to rich men,

<pb id="p.6" n="6"/>
are overcome with no greater ease by those in
humbler station. As the conscience becomes
tender and the convictions strong, the work
of common life trenches on the region that
is Tabu. If A surrenders his brewery and a
fortune for conscience' sake, because he will
not face the responsibility of the death and
degradation awaiting some, at all events, of
the clients of the family tap, how can B, the
conscientious vatman, retain his employment ?
He knows that the beer which he assists to
brew, judiciously blended with salt and
indicus cocculus by needy middle-men, will
bemuse and degrade a certain number of his
brothers and sisters in blood.</p>
<p>Cutting off the right hand, and mutilating
the eyesight, would now subject the convert
to the charge of fanaticism, if not to seclusion
in an establishment for the insane. To refrain
from doing our alms before men would deprive
example of half its force, besides impairing
the security of many a seat in Parliament.
To abandon the defence of private rights
would give to <persName key="Hyndman">Mr. Hyndman</persName>, and to men like
the late <persName key="Peace">Mr. Peace</persName>, too favourable a field for

<pb id="p.7" n="7"/>
the exercise of their abilities. Strict
obedience to the command, "Take no thought
what ye shall eat," would subject many an
honoured saint to claret a shade too warm.
Is he to kill the "old man" until he is
indifferent to the catastrophe of an overdressed
canvas-back duck? Who among the
comfortable classes can feel that the triumph of
mind and spirit over body and matter is such
that he cares not whether his wine be Cape
claret or Clos Vougeot: whether he smoke
shag tobacco or Partagas Imperiales; or, if
a woman, whether she have that sense of being
perfectly well dressed-a sense which, as the
French cynic tells us, confers a sense of
peace religion itself is powerless to
bestowor whether she is a frump ?</p>
<p>Nonconformist objections restrict the
enjoyment to be obtained from rioting in
religious statistics. It is revealed, however,
by the faithful Whitaker, that the forms of
faith followed in the British Islands number
at least one hundred and ninety-one. Among
them they have founded societies to assuage
every evil, and to combat every error. Lost

<pb id="p.8" n="8"/>
dogs and lost women, other folks' servants,
equatorial Africans, and English Jews, tons
of tracts, and bewildered emigrants, engage
the confused energies of thousands of
firstclass hearts and fourth-class heads. From
time to time society is stirred by a movement
of wider influence; and, as in the case of
<persName key="Booth, General">General Booth</persName>'s enterprise, receives  the
blessings and the anathemas which are
equally effectual in conferring the desired
notoriety and in obtaining the necessary cash.
As the upper classes lounge and travel, dress,
bet, shoot, race and struggle through the
miasmatic lowlands of ennui with more or
less success, without being driven to the
practice of an active faith, the middle and
lower classes find in the vocabulary and
emotion of religion cheap and effectual
antidotes to the dreary monotony of their unlovely
lives. Or, as a sage puts it, "the lower
classes care as little for the dogmas of religion
as the upper classes care for its practice."
They are palsied eyes, however, that cannot
discover here and there on the prairie of
convention, flower-souls reflecting the glory of the
blue sky in all its beauty and simplicity,

<pb id="p.9" n="9"/>
adorned with the greatness of unselfish life,
because they live to abandon the aim and end
of personal ease and personal fame. Such
a one was Gordon. His legacy to the
English people is not fully understood, because
the legatees can enjoy it only by a personal
administration of the trust.</p>
<p>Since the Sermon on the Mount has been
sub-edited  by  English  society  and  its
teachers in accordance with the requirements
of a high standard of comfort, the luxury of
the few confronts the misery of millions with
a sharpness of contrast hitherto achieved by
no nation since the story of mankind was first
written. Religion has become a thing of
words and buildings. Religion endowed so
that the carriage of the Cross is ofttimes the
means to win high place and high comfort,
nas converted the Narrow Way into a path to
the <placeName key="House of Lords ">House of Lords </placeName>as well as to the Place of
a Skull. Were Christ the Teacher to return
to London, how long would He remain aloof
from an attack on the problems of a great
City? Responsibility exists, and cannot be
explained away. On our rulers and on our
teachers the heavy burden lies; but there are

<pb id="p.10" n="10"/>
few whose rest is troubled by the thought of
the things undone that ought to be done, or
by the shame that would drive away all sleep
from their eyes if those eyes could see and
understand the remediable wrongs inflicted
on a stricken and a feeble folk.</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="Chapter II: The National Debt" id="c2">
<head>CHAPTER II</head>
<div2 type="subchapter" n="THE NATIONAL DEBT" id="c2s1">
<p>ORACLES, who have never lacked a cutlet,
tell us that the conditions of industrial life in
England contrast favourably with those
prevailing in countries where the standard of
comfort is lower. Nevertheless, the social
question in England is shrouded in greater
darkness than the social questions of <orgName key="Imperial
Germany">Imperial
Germany</orgName> or <orgName key="Republican France">Republican France</orgName>. Nowhere
in <placeName key="Berlin">Berlin</placeName> or in<placeName key=" Paris"> Paris</placeName> can be found the surging
crowd of passionate seekers for work, who fight
as wild beasts at the <placeName key="London Dock Gates">London Dock Gates</placeName>
on winter mornings with monotony of want.
It is true that here and there, as at Liege,
Decazeville, or Antwerp, there is an eruption

<pb id="p.12" n="12"/>
of the Continental proletariat into aimless
fury against their rulers. Great Britain has a
rough average of 800,000 paupers entertained
by the State, and probably half a million more
supported from the resources of charity. No
comparison, therefore, can be instituted
between the English and Continental social
questions without an allowance for the fact
that, however appalling the mass of our
national misery may be, provision has already
been made for at least a million and a
quarter of our social failures, who, but for the
premium of insurance known as the Poor Law,
would anticipate the coming struggle between
the Haves and the Have-nots by several years.
Great as was the sum of poverty and
degradation inherited by this generation from that
which preceded it, we are making no
sensible reductions of this debt to humanity, and
are in a fair way to hand down to the next
generation greater embarrassment, with more
efficient machinery for the manufacture of
larger masses of human degradation.  Such
is the financial chastity of the present school
of statesmen, that the maintenance of the
national money debt at its present figure is

           <pb id="p.13" n="13"/>
regarded with abhorrence, and the
suspension of the Sinking fund is resorted to only
under the menace of national calamity. The
money debt is now &#x00A3;740,330,654, or less
than &#x00A3;20 per head.  In <date value="1815">1815</date> it was &#x00A3;45
per head.  While, therefore, liability for
past expenditure has relatively diminished,
responsibility for the submerged stratum of
our fellow-subjects has increased to almost
unmanageable dimensions. In London alone
there is a <placeName key="Norwich">Norwich</placeName> full of prostitutes; a
<placeName key="Huntingdon">Huntingdon</placeName> full of known criminals; two
<placeName key="Nottinghams">Nottinghams</placeName> full of folk without homes;
for whom famine is ever on the horizon, and
deficiency of food always in the foreground.
As the rich grow richer the poor get poorer.
Between<placeName key=" Dives"> Dives</placeName> and <placeName key="Lazarus">Lazarus</placeName> the great gulf
fixed becomes deeper, wider, and blacker
month by month and year by year.
Imagination is needed to believe that once upon a
time the <placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName> flowed clear at the Tower,
or that our country was ever known as Merry
England.  Night by night, and day by day,
rise through the canopy of smoke the
lamentations of those who rue the day they
were born. I have seen men throw themselves

<pb id="p.14" n="14"/>
on the granite setts of the street, praying for
death to end the hopeless misery of want of
food and want of work. I have heard the
wailing of hungry children, locked foodless
into a bare insanitary room, while the mother,
stung to exertion by maternal instinct all too
soon after recent child-birth, seeks, like a
beast of prey, for wherewithal to stay the
famine of her young ones.  I have watched
unseen, strong men who had served their
Queen, gaunt with want, gaze wistfully from
the bridge parapet at the dark waters of the
<placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName>, longing to end troubles thrust upon
them by the way of the world. From the
cheap lodging-houses, from  the railway
arches, from the crowded streets, rises an
ever-increasing volume of inarticulate and
unquenchable misery.  Compared with the
nomadic tribes of tropic countries, where the
curse of civilization is unknown, the nomads
of London are but miserable savages.
Capable of greater suffering, they are
condemned to acuter pain.  Hypocrisy, when
crime fails, as a last resort may yield a crust.
Mission rooms, covered with a rash of texts-
Chaldee to the hungry and broken man-are

        <pb id="p.15" n="15"/>
open to the vagrant and the " dosser."  But
it cannot be denied that, notwithstanding the
combined efforts of all the churches and the
machinery of all the societies, no real advance
is being made in the process of killing out the
prolific powers of evil.  Statistics published
by an optimistic Home Secretary may satisfy
those who wish to blunt their sense of
personal responsibility, that the curves of official
pauperism and of crime are ever sinking in
comparison with the numbers of the
population.</p>
<p>The curve of misery is not included in
official returns.  It is not to be obtained
either at the <orgName key="Local Government Board">Local Government Board</orgName> or at
the Home Office.  Ministers are not always
to blame. They, poor souls, are but pith
figures, dancing only when the electricity of
public opinion energizes the cellulose of their
puppet systems.  When the current is at
rest, their strength is to sit still, and thus the
fatal moment of collision between the classes
and the masses approaches with astronomical
certainty.</p>
<p>As many causes have led to the existence
of the social question, it is idle to look for

<pb id="p.16" n="16"/>
one sovereign cure and one alone. Panaceas
do not exist to transmute the corrosion of
national life into a healing process.  As
the causes are various, the remedies are
many; and none is to be despised because it
contributes but little to the solution of the
problem. No man has hitherto attempted to
deal with the social question as a whole.
Many have concentrated energy on a stray
symptom of the disease, and look for restored
health when the general adoption of their own
specific is an accomplished fact.
Temperance people hold drink to be the cause of
distress, though it is laid down by others
that distress is the cause of the drink.
Reckless and improvident marriages are
considered by Malthusians to be at the root of
our social trouble. Liberation of labour and
the overthrow of the present economical
system is believed by the advertised followers
of <persName key="Marx">Marx</persName> and <persName key="Lassalle">Lassalle</persName> to be the right way to
get behind the north wind in the struggle for
existence. Those who have emerged from
the competitive struggle with the spoils of
war are justifiably content with the system of
laissez-faire.  "The poor in the lump is

          <pb id="p.17" n="17"/>
bad" is the standpoint of many besides
the Northern Farmer.  Free trade and
unfettered liberty for the play of economic laws
is the gospel of the " fat and greasy citizen;"
and any effort to lay impious hands on the
ark of free contract is the unpardonable sin.
Freedom! Liberty ! Freedom   to starve;
liberty to go to the devil.  If<persName key="Bismarck"> Bismarck</persName>
Cromwellizes the frontiers of the Fatherland,,
and thousands of Polish and German Jews fly
to <placeName key="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</placeName>, <placeName key="Saint George'">Saint George'</placeName>s-in-the-East,
<placeName key="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</placeName>, and <placeName key="Bethnal Green">Bethnal Green</placeName>, the master
sweating-tailors are free to extort harder
work for lower wage from their women and
girl workers of English blood on account of
the competition of foreign cheap labour; and
the girl-wives and daughters are free to hawk
their persons in the streets of our English
city to fill up the chasm caused by the
operation of the law of unrestricted
competition. Reflection alone is needed to show
that the death struggle of carnivorous animals,
and the logical consequence of unrestricted
freedom of contract, are convertible terms.
The following is a statement from
authoritative sources, expressed in official language:-

<pb id="p.18" n="18"/>
"Female labour is wretchedly paid. In
shirt-making (for export) and similar
employment a woman gets about ninepence to a
shilling for a day's work of sixteen hours.
There are hundreds of women who work for
three-farthings an hour and find their own
needles and cotton. The prices include:
Shirts, three-farthings each; flannel drawers
for Chelsea pensioners, one shilling and
threepence a dozen; soldiers' leggings, two
shillings a dozen; and lawn-tennis aprons,
elaborately frilled, fivepence-halfpenny a
dozen to the 'sweater,' the actual worker
getting much less. In such kinds of women's
work, however, the whole profit does not, as
is supposed, go to the 'sweater,' but finds
its way in great measure into the pockets of
the middle-men and retail dealers.  The
public, too, have often in some degree the
benefit of these starvation wages."
The following details of fifty men employed
by sweating tailors were obtained in reply to
questions addressed to the men themselves:-</p></div2>

Englishmen are governed by phrases. The
most beneficent institution, were it entitled
"<title>Star Chamber,</title>" would stand no chance of
winning the public confidence. "Home Rule"
has destroyed the Liberal party; " Local SelfGovernment"      is  conceded   by all parties
alike.  So with " freedom" and "slavery."
<placeName key="Oriental London ">Oriental London </placeName>enjoys the advantages of
the worst and most squalid forms of slavery

is nothing incongruous when a million and a

<p>Misery and despair, loathing of the curse

religion, groanings that cannot be uttered, an
ever-growing torrent of children poured into
an environment of wretchedness and vice, are
some of the chemicals seething in the caldron
of civilization.  Abroad we have done no
better.  Tribes chaste and temperate are
decimated by loathsome diseases, and ruined
by raw spirits proffered by the hand that

<p>Many a valiant soul fights gallantly to
stem the tide of woe and want. But their
efforts, if not fruitless, make no permanent
and palpable impress on the mass of wrong
to be cleared away. Ever increasing at
compound interest, the volume of our national
debt grows with rapid strides, and even now
the mutterings of subterranean fires can be
heard by those who have ears to ear and who
are not muffled in comfort. Every winter a
bitter cry is raised by permanent distress.
Fleeting notice is attracted, and twopence-halfpenny

<pb id="p.24" n="24"/>

by the influence of a <orgName key="Mansion House

<p>What is to be done in order to liquidate
the National Debt? The right course to
pursue may be doubtful, but it is clear that
this is no time to stand in the ancient ways.
The present system of the churches after a
course of evangelical teaching extending over
one hundred and fifty years has failed beyond
hope of redemption. Philanthropy is a paid
profession supporting swarms of
administrators. The struggle for existence between
benevolent societies is as bitter as the strife
between the various forms of the Christian
faith, or between members of the same
Cabinet. Disease has corroded the texture
of civilization, and such an analysis as
was never bestowed upon it is needed
before prescriptions can be prepared and
exhibited to the suffering nation with any
hope of success.  Diagnosis of the disease
          <pb id="p.25" n="25"/>
is not impossible.  The evil is broadly
divisible into two parts-the remediable and
that which is essentially incapable of cure.
The remediable portion is again to be divided
into (1) That which can be attacked and
dealt with by society at large forthwith,
and (2) That which requires the process of
time for the development of healing measures.
In other words, the work for this generation
is one part, and work for the next generation
is the second portion of the task. Then
again, the remedies applicable by society,
either legislative or otherwise, are precedent
to the efforts of those on whose behalf society
bestirs itself.  The work as a whole is a
process and not a stroke.  It cannot be
carried out by legislation alone.  Law is
nothing more than the floating opinion of the
majority of the people, crystallized in the
form of an Act of Parliament. Law that is
in advance of or behind the convictions of the
majority is inoperative.  <title>The Act of Charles
11. on Sunday Trading</title>, and <title>the Contagious
Diseases Acts</title> lately repealed, are instances
of each contingency.</p>
<p>That which is required, therefore, is the

<pb id="p.26" n="26"/>
creation of wholesome public opinion in regard
to specific evils needing prompt and drastic
treatment, and the excitement of such a sense
of universal individual responsibility that it
can neither be alienated nor evaded. We
need the Conscription for social affairs. The
party of<orgName key=" Social Reform"> Social Reform</orgName> is at present in
agreement about nothing, although most people
have a general conviction that a great deal
requires to be done, with a leaning towards
drugs from their own pharmacopoeia.
Convention, and its cousin Decorum, combine
with the safe formalities of a Christianity
ignorant of its Founder, to prevent discussion
or inquiry into some of the root causes of the
evil. The art of embellishing the outside of
the platter is incapable of further
development. We live in the golden age of whited
walls. Any poor wight, therefore, who is
resolute in stripping horror of its clothing may lay
to his account the certain enmity of most of
the clergy and all the paid philanthropists who
batten on the process of whiting the wall with
a dainty brush of camels' hair.</p></div2>

<p>PROBLEMS unsolved, and prayers ungranted
abound. No problem is more perplexing than
the steady advance of democratic power,
while the physical and mental strength and
health of a large fraction of the democracy
are undermined by the conditions of their
lives. Democratic Government means the
inclusion of those who are ignorant of the
laws of hereditary transmission, who are least
prepared to lay down present ease for future
good, and who are least accustomed to resist
the impulse of passion or the suggestions of
desire. Democratic Government means the
inclusion of those who are the results of immature,

 and often of pauper, marriages.
Medical science mitigates suffering, but
preserves the diseased. Maladies arising from
profligacy are controlled and half cured.
Natural penalties of excess are remitted by
medical science. Sanitary precautions, poor
laws, vaccination, hospitals, charity, save from
death and preserve to marry and to vote,
thousands of those who must lead dismal and
imperfect lives, and who, but for the meddling
of science, would have died. Thus, the
destinies of England depend on the issue of a
struggle between moral and mental
enlightenment and mental and physical deterioration.
Tainted constitutions, brains charged with
subtle mischief, and languishing or extinct
morality, transmit a terrible inheritance of evil
to the next generation, there to taint once
more a whole community. And those who
multiply as ephemera are the squalid
inhabitants of hovels subsisting on degraded and
adulterated foods; and acquiring their joys
from the gratification of lust, and the
absorption in excess of drugged and poisonous forms
of alcohol. We thus have a practical
example of the fact that the tendency of the

   <pb id="p.29" n="29"/>
higher civilization is to multiply from the
lower and not from the higher specimens of
the race. A higher average of life has been
bought at the price of a lower average of
health.  In low and miserable
neighbourhoods the amount of labour lost in the year,
not by illness, but by sheer exhaustion and
inability to do the work, amounts, on the
lowest average, to twenty days in the year.<note place="foot" n="1"><title>Blue Book,</title> C. 4402-28. See also the <title>Report of the
<orgName key="Royal Commission on the Housing of the Poor">Royal Commission on the Housing of the Poor</orgName>.</title></note>
</p><p>The species is being propagated and
continued increasingly, though not of course
exclusively, from the idle, unthrifty, undersized,
and unfit. As luxury and success corrupt the
<placeName key="West End">West End</placeName>, <placeName key="the East">the East</placeName> is corrupted by want and
failure. As in the West there are those who,
born to wealth, revelling in wealth, are destitute
of the qualities by which wealth is won, or its
possession made a blessing to the community:
so in the East, those born to poverty,
wallowing in misery, are, many of them, devoid of
the qualities by which life is sustained in
dignity, if not in comfort, and perpetuated
by means of a healthy and capable progeny.
Comfort-worship in the West leads to extravagant
<pb id="p.30" n="30"/>   .
 prudence.  Comfort-worship in the
East leads to despair and its consequences.
It is thus that the very rich and the very poor
marry as early as they please-the motive to
abstain is absent from either class.  The
trustworthy, energetic element of the
population-those who long to rise and do not choose
to sink-abstain from marriage. Favourites
of fortune and the desperate classes are those
who most freely undertake the responsibilities
of parentage, and from whom the population
is replenished.</p>
<p>If it be monstrous that the weak should be
destroyed by the strong, how much more
repugnant it is to instinct and to reason that
the strong and capable should be overwhelmed
by the feeble, ailing, and unfit ?
To prevent such a catastrophe it is needful
that society should recognize as essential -</p>
<p>1. That, preceding the production of
children, should be the power or the prospect of
maintaining them.</p>
<p>2. That the propagation of diseased or
infected constitutions shall be condemned, or
even regarded as criminal. Such diseases as
scrofula, consumption, and syphilis are amenable

    <pb id="p.31" n="31"/>
 to the conditions under which leprosy
and plague have become extinct diseases in
England and in <placeName key="America">America</placeName>.  A moderate
expansion of this idea would lead to the
extermination of the unfit as a class.</p>
<p>3. That idleness and dissipation are
discreditable in all classes.</p>
<p>As our tenderness to suffering is
accompanied by a gentleness towards wrong, it is
impossible to grapple with the suffering caused
by wrong without shocking the gentleness of
society.</p>
<p>One <persName key="Doubleday">Doubleday</persName>, forty years ago, hit on a
theory which has since received the sanction
of better known men. The lower down in
the scale of creation, and the worse fed, the
greater the fertility, was the substance of his
idea.  The  whale brings forth  but one
or two at a birth. Animalcul&#x00E6; forming the
staple diet of the whale provide for posterity
millions of their kind. Elephants and
herrings, the dwellers in <placeName key="Grosvenor Square">Grosvenor Square</placeName> and
in <placeName key="Collier's Rents, Borough">Collier's Rents, Borough</placeName>, are examples
testifying to the accuracy of observations
made by the late <persName key="Doubleday">Mr. Doubleday</persName>. It is
regrettable that the relative fecundity of the

<pb id="p.32" n="32"/>
comfortable and the uncomfortable classes is
not established beyond cavil or dispute, by
the process of official investigation; but
sufficient data exist to place the fundamental
correctness of the theory beyond reasonable
attack.  Anyone who is sufficiently interested
in the inductive method to make an
investigation for himself can do no better than to
compare a list of his married friends and their
children with a like number of families who
are actually engaged in the struggle for
existence east of<placeName key=" Aldgate Church"> Aldgate Church</placeName>.  The
results obtained will be surprising to those
who are content to believe that the population
of England is increasing on safe lines.  The
unemployed and unfit classes marry early and
often.  Prudence in their connubial
arrangements is unknown, as we shall see hereafter.
The annual increase in the population
proceeds mainly from the classes who add no
strength to the nation. In the process of
filling their quivers, the folk whose normal lot
is to be within half-a-crown of starvation are
countenanced by many of the clergy of all
denominations; and, excepting the Roman
Catholic Church, they add to their clerical

   <pb id="p.33" n="33"/>
precepts the force of a vigorous example.
To be fruitful and multiply in London involves
a suppressed injunction to starve, or live on
other people.  In the lowest class of all
marriage is all but unknown. Vicious celibacy
is the rule, and liberal contributions to the
illegitimacy rate are supplied from the nomadic
tribes infesting the darker haunts of London.</p>
<p>In England marriage is fixed at the age of
puberty, as defined in the Roman Law-viz.,
fourteen for males and twelve for females.
The absence of the consent of parents or
guardians does not invalidate a marriage.</p>
<p><title>The Code Napoleon</title> (Arts. 144-226)
prescribes the ages of eighteen for the man and
fifteen for the woman. A son under
twentyfive and a daughter under twenty-one cannot
marry without the consent of the father and
mother, or of the father only if they disagree,
or of the survivor if one be dead.
Precocious marriage in the <placeName key="East End">East End</placeName> is
prevalent to an extent inconceivable to the
prudent mind of the West, and is followed
by disunion, separation, adultery, and recourse
to charity or the rates. It is recorded by the
<persName key="Hosely, Rev. J.W.">Rev. J. W. Horsley </persName>that of 176 cases of

<pb id="p.34" n="34"/>
premature marriage which came under his
notice in <placeName key="Clerkenwell Prison">Clerkenwell Prison</placeName>, in one case the
husband had been fourteen years of age when
he abandoned the irresponsible position of
bachelor life.  This young gentleman was
subsequently apprehended for trigamy when
thirty-four.  In eleven cases the wife was
fourteen years old. In two cases the husband,
and in twelve the wife, was fifteen. In twelve
cases the husband, in forty-six the wife, and
in three cases both were sixteen.
Twentyseven husbands and forty-eight wives were
seventeen when they began housekeeping,
and in thirteen cases both of the happy pair
boasted of that age. Alcoholic infanticide is
the usual consequence of this class of union,
though they are complacently included in
that high marriage rate which is held out as
one of the prouder features of English social
life. The law gives no power either to the
clergy or to registrars to delay such unnatural
alliances, when the consent of parents or
guardians is not withheld. Half a hundred banns
of marriage are gabbled over on a Sunday
morning in some East End churches, and the
clergy not unnaturally feel that the quantity

    <pb id="p.35" n="35"/>
of marriages absolves them from
responsibility.  Wild weather comes too soon to
these silly boys and girls, but the evil
inflicted on society by their reckless
incontinence is greater still. True, we must face a
somewhat increased illegitimacy rate, were
these marriages prevented by law, but if we
thrust aside the phrase, and look into the
essence of the thing, it is beyond dispute
that a small increase of illegitimacy is a
lesser evil than a large though legalised
production of thieves and prostitutes.</p>
<p>In <placeName key="East End">the East End</placeName> every boy of fourteen or
fifteen keeps company with his "bit of
frock." At seventeen or eighteen marriage
is contemplated, and at nineteen or twenty
it is often, if not generally, perpetrated.
Marriage! The sanction of the Church of
England and of the high and mighty court
of Parliament is accorded to these loathsome
unions; and these august bodies are
therefore accessory to the manufacture of the
diseased and incapable children who bubble
out of the ground for torment in this world
if not in the next.</p>
<p>East End marriages are often "solemnized"

<pb id="p.36" n="36"/>
hurriedly on Sunday mornings by tired curates
in empty churches. At the <orgName key="Red Church">" Red Church"</orgName>
the fee is sevenpence.  This church is
popularly distinguished by a title which
cannot be reproduced here.   The following
statement of the methods in which this tie
is contracted was published by the <persName key="Mason, Rev. Charles L.">Rev.
Charles L. Marson,</persName> a competent witness,
and the facts recorded therein have not been
contradicted by the responsible clergy:-</p>
<p>" The church door was securely barred, and
ingress was with difficulty effected.</p>
<p>"This was a double precaution: to prevent
more grog being brought into the church,
and to prevent the escape of semi-intoxicated
bridegrooms. Inside the church was a noisy,
indecorous crowd.   Doubtful jokes were
being bandied about, which grew coarser and
coarser as time went on. Hats were freely
worn, and drink bottles were passed to and
fro, and handed across the aisles.  Every
now and then a prayer book or other missile
was playfully thrown by one of the crowd.</p>
<p>"After a long interval, during which the
legal business was being transacted, the
ceremony began, and my informant gradually

     <pb id="p.37" n="37"/>
worked his way up to the west end.  The
method pursued was to call the Christian
names of the men together, and all the
Christian names of the women, and insert
the words 'in each case.'</p>
<p>"Thus the forty couples were united in
holy matrimony.</p>
<p>" One man was so recalcitrant, he had to
be led three times, drunk as he was, up to the
altar; when my informant protested against
the indecency of allowing the ceremony in his
case to proceed, but was told that the
drunken bridegroom  was already legally
married. The bag was then handed round
for the freewill offerings, and amid a shower
of the coarsest jokes freely shouted after
them, the newly-married went out of the
church.</p>
<p>"Outside, the foulest and most indecent
jests met them, and pantomimic acting of the
worst kind; and thus ended the ceremony
which celebrated their entrance into the
mystical union of marriage.</p>
<p>"My own experience, and that of several
others, bears out this account in the minutest
particulars, and I have more than once

<pb id="p.38" n="38"/>
followed the bride and bridegroom to the
nearest pothouse. One man told me he was
married at the age of eighteen in the <orgName key="Red Church">Red
Church</orgName>, and his 'party boozed until
teatime,' which he thought was the usual
custom 'immediately afterwards.'  Several
of the bridegrooms, while still in church,
declared, with an oath, that they were off for
beer, and they called loudly upon their friends
to join them.
</p><p>" No wonder that there is a current popular
belief that 'marriage at the<orgName key="Red Church">the Red Church</orgName>
brings ill-luck with it.' Thus lightly
undertaken, one expects next to hear of these
marriages at the House, and the Relieving
Officers report that the majority of married
women admitted to the workhouse for their
first confinement were married at the Red
Church.
</p><p>" What work is built upon the basis of these
marriages ? Seemingly none. A curious
person who wandered into the<orgName key="Red Church">the Red Church</orgName> upon
the first Sunday of the month saw a curious
sight. One young lady, two clergy, and an
organist, the organ-blower, and two infirm old
ladies formed the congregation. About the
    <pb id="p.39" n="39"/>
end of the Litany old women began to drop
in by twos and threes, until there were
twenty-two of them in all. One even brought
an epileptic husband with her.  The last
woman came in, and asked the stranger 'how
long the old gentleman' (the preacher) 'had
been up there.' In turn he asked her how
there was such a large congregation, and was
told carelessly, ' They come for the
coalsthat's all.' 'How much coal do you get for
coming?' 'Only 14  still it's worth coming
for.' Thus the opportunity of knitting
together into a congregation the people who
come into the church is entirely lost, and the
<orgName key="Red Church">Red Church</orgName> does hardly anything else than
harm.
</p><p>"The East London marriages are a most
depressing subject for contemplation. They
neither hallow life, nor are legally punctilious
as a general rule. They do not tend in the least
degree to deepen the sanctity of the marriage
tie, to give the lie to a blasphemous political
economy, to inculcate self-restraint and awe.
They are performed with yawning, hurry, and
neglect, sometimes with every antithesis to
sanctity, and can only be remembered as dry

<pb id="p.40" n="40"/>
legal facts, which would be more efficiently
chronicled under the civil code. We should
not readily hear the last of a drinking bout
performed with sacramental cups; but this
would be quite a light form of irreligion to
that which weekly goes on in our churches,
where the sacrament of marriage is profaned
and degraded until it is drained dry of all holy
ghostliness, and presents nothing but the foul
dregs of impurity, carelessness, and irreligious
animalism."</p><p>
The opinion of an able and experienced
clergyman, who writes under the nom-de.
plume of <persName key="Peter the Hermit">" Peter the Hermit,"</persName> and who has
done a great and noble work for many years,
is as follows :
</p><p>" One thing I have given up all hope of, and
that is, influencing boys or girls to see the folly
of premature engagements and unions. These
have grown too much the practice of the world
they live in.  Everyone in their class marries
early, and a large proportion
prematurelythat is, while still in their teens. I have
talked for hours, days, weeks, months, nay
years, to the most sensible, and most under
my influence in other respects, and tried to

    <pb id="p.41" n="41"/>
dissuade them; but all in vain. They listen
and laugh, and think I am looking at the
world through spectacles of my own. ' Oh,
no,' they say, 'we will wait till we get
baldheaded.' There is no convincing them; and
any change for the better must come from
without. A good deal of the evil is due to
want of occupation of mind. They have none
of the sports of young men in these densely
populated regions of London.  The
consequence is-for human nature will have
something to relieve the tedium of existence-the
thoughts turn to love, instead of cricket and
football. Recreation grounds-that is,
playgrounds, not disused burial-grounds-will tend
to prevent their flowing prematurely in this
channel. And there is another movement
tending in the same direction, of which I am
about to speak; but for the present necessity
I am persuaded a legal limitation is
indispensable. We have lately been paternal: let
us be paternal a step further, to save the
youth of England.   These marriages are
as bad as anything which has recently
been brought under our notice-in fact they
are a part of the same unpleasant sub-declarations

<pb id="p.44" n="44"/>
 of age I would make penal, and
the marriages of the persons guilty of them
null and void. If it could, by means thus
roughly indicated, be made impossible for
the marriages of infants to take place, the
legislature would put a powerful check upon
early seductions, since young people could
no longer resort to the cloak of matrimony."
Of fifteen marriages taking place at -
Church in an <orgName key="East London Parish">East London Parish</orgName> on a

</p><p>The rest were between 27 and 35.
</p><p>The following is the report of the scene

     <pb id="p.45" n="45"/>
that took place at the celebration of the rites
of holy matrimony:-
</p><p>" Inside the church there was a noisy mob;
obscene jests were freely shouted out, and
every minute they became coarser and more
objectionable as the brides and bridegrooms
became more intoxicated. One old lady,
reeling about, was singing a Salvation Army
tune set to a filthy jargon about the joys of
married life, whilst some of the bridegrooms
were shouting one to another to come and
have another -- swig of beer; in fact, two
couples had to be married half an hour after
the rest because the happy bridegrooms had
'gone for a booze' and could not be found.
</p><p>" It is a striking fact that out of all the
fifteen couples only one had any holiday
clothes to wear for such an important
occasion. All the rest were in old working
clothes, and some in rags.
</p><p>"After waiting till a quarter to twelve, the
ceremony began. The Curate read all the
names of the men first, and gabbled with
them through their part, afterwards doing

<pb id="p.46" n="46"/>
the same with the women, interlarded with a
few remarks like this: ' Now then, -,
you are not saying it after me; you will have
to say it by yourself if you ain't careful.' Or
to another it would be: 'Say I will, and not
yes, you idiot!' While this was proceeding
the few who had strolled in to see the
weddings were indulging in filthy jokes and
suggestive actions quite openly, with no more
respect for the house of God than if it was a
stable.
</p><p>" The church itself is in a shocking dirty
and dilapidated state. One window near the
altar, containing twenty-eight panes of glass,
has thirteen broken; the dirty plaster is
peeling from the walls, and nearly half the ceiling
has fallen, leaving the bare rafters exposed to
view.
</p><p>" After the ceremony all adjourned to the
nearest public-house except one young couple,
who stood outside the church gazing stupidly
about.  I spoke to them, and asked if they
lived close handy, but the young man said:
'I ain't got er place to go to yet; my old
man don't know as I'm married, no more
does 'er old woman-do she, Nell?  We've

    <pb id="p.47" n="47"/>
got married on the sly.'  After chatting for
some few minutes, his girl wife said to him:
'The parson does chuck it of his chest, don't
he, Bill ?' And Bill answered with an oath:
'Well, and wot ther-  - do you want
for sevenpence halfpenny ?'"</p>
<p>To Bank Holidays may be attributed a
portion of the origin of this evil. " So far,"
writes the clergyman already quoted, "so
far from canonizing <persName key="Lubbock, Sir John">Sir John Lubbock</persName>, if
there be any opposite process I would
ruthlessly apply it to him, for most of the
premature marriages are his doing."</p>
<p>The other cause of the evil of reckless and
premature marriage is the unloveliness and
restrictions of the working man's home.
Weary lads, without mental or physical
resources, swarm from the alley hive before a
stock of honey has been laid in for winter
use. As a natural result there is a married
pauper class, growing in numbers, who drag
along during the summer with hopping,
"hobjobbing," and casual labour, depending for
subsistence in winter time on the rates and
on the charity that maintains and propagates
the evils it blindly hopes to extinguish.

<pb id="p.48" n="48"/>
Zulus, Basutos, Amatongas, and other
varieties of "poor heathen" pursue a different
practice. It is attended with success. Every
girl is the equivalent of so many cattle, and
unless the swain can produce them, in
exchange for his bride, he may live and die a
bachelor.  Kimberley diamonds are delved
for by ebony Corydons labouring for the
Phillises waiting for them throughout the
length and breadth of the uplands south
of the <placeName key="Zambesi">Zambesi</placeName>. The bottomless rottenness
of English cant prefers the fiction of a
marriage tie with the facts of filth and
infidelity, to enforced abstention from
undertaking impossible responsibilities, at all events
with the sanction of the State. It is not too
late to place legislative obstacles in the way
of unions repugnant to a true sense of purity,
hostile to national interests, and fraught with
evil to the living and to generations unborn,
by demanding from male minors evidence of
means, before undertaking the burden of
family life.</p>
<p>Criminal and pauperised classes with low
cerebral development renew their race more
rapidly than those of higher nervous natures.

       <pb id="p.49" n="49"/>
Statesmen idly stand by, watching in such
moments as they can spare from the strife of
party the victory of battalions destined to
misery and crime over the struggling army
of the prudent and the self-controlled.  Birth
into certain quarters of London is birth into
an environment from which there is no escape.
At three years old baby lips lisp oaths so
bestial as to be coarse in the betel-stained
mouths of the crew of a Coromandel dhoney.
At six, little girls are initiated by their
mothers into practices so loathsome the
gorge rises at the thought. At ten, girls and
boys alike, are unclean spirits limited in their
power for evil only    by  their abilities.
Dynasties of criminals and paupers hand down
from generation to generation hereditary
unfitness for the arts of progress and all that brings
greatness to a nation, and engage themselves
in warring against all forms of physical and
moral order. Where a man is criminal
himself, the cause of crime in others, and the
begetter of criminal posterity, it seems to be
an act of mere self-protection on the part of
this generation to segregate him.  No less is
it an act of justice to the next generation to

<pb id="p.50" n="50"/>
take such measures as will, in conformity
with enlightened public opinion, prevent him
from tainting posterity with the pledges of
his affection.  In Eastern countries this
matter could be discussed with greater ease.
English convention forbids the discussion
of detail which would otherwise be desirable.
A Parliamentary vote to meet the cost of
shutting up for life confirmed criminals
cannot, however, bring a blush to any cheek.
A woman of <placeName key="New York">New York</placeName> belonging to the
criminal class died at a great age. She had
spent forty years of her own life in prison.
Investigation was made into what is termed
her "life history," and it was found that
over a hundred of her descendants had at
one time or another abused the protection
of the American Eagle. This may be an
extreme example, but it is obvious that
economy would have resulted to the American
Republic from a luxurious but compulsory
hospitality being accorded to the lady in
question for the term of her natural life, from
the time when her proclivity for crime became
so marked as justly to deserve the epithet
Habitual. Were criminals segregated for life

    <pb id="p.51" n="51"/>
after repeated conviction, posterity would, at all
events, manufacture most of their own crime,
instead of receiving from us so handsome a
legacy as that which is now being prepared.
Such a course would be costly, and would not
lend itself to statistics. We could not count
the gain, with precision. Diminution of crime
and pauperism would result, but in unknown
quantities.  What is hit is History, what is
missed is Mystery.</p><p>
The following advertisement from the <title>Times</title>
is the result of a type of outrage to be
perpetrated by any healthy and impecunious
curate with a light heart, with the sanction
of the Church, and with the blessing of
conventional society:-
</p><p>" An urgent and earnest appeal is made on
behalf of a widow and six young children,
who, by the sudden death of the husband-a
clergyman-are left penniless.  Will some
kind hearts come forward either to adopt or
contribute towards the education and
maintenance of the children, or aid the poor
widow in her bitter hour of need?  The
highest references and full particulars can be
given, and contributions," &amp;c.

<pb id="p.52" n="52"/>
Teachers of men who incur direct money
liabilities they are unable to discharge are
unfrocked.  Indirect responsibilities to
unborn children, to be redeemed in case of
death by an unknown public, are accepted
with complacency, since the conventions of
cant do not reprobate the offender with the
illwill of respectable society. Daughters may
go to the streets and sons to Dartmoor as the
consequence of selfish marriage, but the smug
maxims governing what the clergyman termed
"the so-called nineteenth century" not only
condone, but encourage the offence of
bringing into the world creatures for whom there is
no reasonable prospect of either healthy or
happy existence. With such examples to the
common people, what hope is there of driving
home the need of thrift and common prudence ?
On the clergy rests, to a large degree,
responsibility for the reckless fecundity which is
part of our national offending.  Healthy
public opinion may well be brought to bear
on the cruelty of precept and example alike
inflicted on the poor by so many of our
pastors.
</p><p>The practice of the Roman Catholic Church

     <pb id="p.53" n="53"/>
in regard to this matter is stated by his
Eminence <persName key="Cardinal Manning">Cardinal Manning</persName> as follows:-
</p><p>"As to early marriages, the Church has
no special laws.  It does not discourage
them, under conditions of common prudence,
knowing the danger of opposing them.
</p><p>" It is a balance of dangers. On the one
side the danger of want and destitution: on
the other, the danger of demoralization. We
fear the latter more than the former, and I
believe <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> shows that we are right and
<placeName key="Bavaria">Bavaria</placeName> confirms it. But then we have more
hold over the married than over the
unmarried, and they come to us more readily
in their troubles. A home, however poor,
is a fixture. The unmarried are untraceable,
and cannot be so easily known and watched
over. They go to and fro. This will not
apply to the general population in the same
degree.
</p><p>"My belief is, that the destruction of
home-life among the people comes from
the extreme right of property and the excesses
of political economy, and, I must add, the
devouring drink
community is

<pb id="p.54" n="54"/>
stated by the<persName key="Singer, Rev. S"> Rev. S. Singer</persName> to be as
follows :
</p><p>"Nowhere, perhaps, are the evils
consequent upon that system (of premature
marriages) more acutely felt than among my own
co-religionists.
</p><p>"Some allowance must, of course, be made
for the Eastern origin of the Jewish people.
Something must also be set down to the fact
that early marriages are looked upon with a
considerable degree of favour by many of our
most trusted teachers, ancient and modern,
who regard the practice as a preventive
against greater evils.  The comparatively
high standard of family morals among Jews
no doubt justifies this anticipation to a certain
extent. Still the question is, whether there
is anything incompatible between prudence
and public morality, and the more far-sighted
among us would fall in with the judicious
conclusion of the Talmud, which in an
exposition of the sequence of verses in Deuteronomy
xx., 5, 6, 7, observes: 'Here the law teaches
us a lesson for the guidance of human society,
and indicates that a man should first build
his house and plant his vineyard and then

      <pb id="p.55" n="55"/>
take a wife, as if to say no marriage should
be undertaken unless the means of support
are at hand and a foundation has been laid
for the fulfilment of the responsibilities of
marriage.'
</p><p>"You ask me what is the practice of the
Jewish community in regard to the marriages
of male minors in the event of their being
unable to support the responsibilities of a
family ?
</p><p>" There is, in fact, no fixed procedure, nor
any regulation on the subject. <orgName key="Our Board
of Guardians and Lying-in Charities">Our Board
of Guardians and Lying-in Charities</orgName> assist
women in their confinements. At
circumcision further help is frequently forthcoming
from the benefactions of our richer brethren,
contributed for that purpose at the
circumcision of their sons.
</p><p>"A public institution of ours, <orgName key="the Jews'
Hospital and Orphan Asylum">the Jews'
Hospital and Orphan Asylum</orgName>, receives,
educates, etc., the children of indigent parents
after election by the subscribers. Our Free
Schools have long given education of a very
high order to the children of the poor, and
through the generosity of a few philanthropic
members of our body, notably the Rothschild

<pb id="p.56" n="56"/>
 family, the poorest among our pupils
are supplied with food and clothing.
</p><p>" <orgName key="The Jewish Board of Guardians">The Jewish Board of Guardians</orgName>
apprentices boys and girls to various trades. The
synagogues at stated periods distribute gifts
in money and in kind. Many families are
assisted to emigrate. There is, indeed, a
general objection to giving pecuniary or other
relief to young people capable of work, but
the objection usually breaks down in the
presence of evident and pinching want.
</p><p>"With deep regret I confess that the innate
benevolence of the Jewish race is at times
itself the cause of the improvidence we all
deplore.
</p><p>" In my visits to the poor in the East of
London I am often staggered at the blind
rashness with which young people have
rushed into marriage. The people to whom I
refer have mostly come from foreign parts
(although instances of early and imprudent
marriages are not rare even in England). It
is not an uncommon thing to find parents of
19 or 20 arriving here from <placeName key="Russia">Russia</placeName> and <placeName key="Poland">Poland</placeName>
with two or three children, and without any
means of supporting themselves and their off-spring.

    <pb id="p.57" n="57"/>
Herein lies, I hold, the chief cause
of that grinding poverty with which the Jews
as a race are afflicted.
</p><p>"The popular notion concerning the wealth
of Jews is a fallacy which ought by this time
to be exploded. The idea owes its origin in
part to the presence of a few opulent families
among us, but still more, perhaps, to the
circumstance that we do not parade our
distress before the world, and, while helping to
support the public burdens, relieve our own
poor independently of parish, and as a rule,
also, of Gentile assistance.
</p><p>"A little practical experience of the
wretchedness our brethren live in would
dispel the popular fancy regarding the wealth of
the Jews, and would carry home the
conviction that for by far the greater part of that
wretchedness nothing is answerable but the
number of early, premature, and imprudent
marriages that take place among us.
</p><p>"Even the beneficent effects of sobriety,
industry, and the strongest family affections,
are to a great extent neutralized from this
cause alone.
</p><p>" For whatever you can do to throw the

<pb id="p.58" n="58"/>
light of reason upon a practice productive of
immense present, and incalculable future,
misery, you ought to earn the gratitude of all
who desire the permanent amelioration of the
condition of the poor."</p><p>
The Nonconformist bodies appear to be
free from the charge of encouraging reckless
and improvident marriages.</p><p>
Limitation of families is a subject that has
been spoiled by <persName key="Bradlaugh">Mr. Bradlaugh</persName> and his
colleagues. In the public mind there is an
indissoluble alliance between deliberate
restriction and aggressive atheism. There is not,
it is true, on the surface any necessary affiance
between the two.  Possibly <persName key="Bradlaugh">Mr. Bradlaugh</persName>
and <persName key="Besant, Mrs.">Mrs. Besant</persName> are people who have lived a
generation too soon. The arguments against
them were employed against <persName key="Simpson, Sir J. Y.">Sir J. Y.

cases of childbirth. An all-wise Creator, it
was said, ordained that women in their travail
should travail in pain, and it would be impious
to impair by an&#x00E6;sthetics the full force of so
wise a provision. A similar line of reasoning
might have been adopted against cropping
the hair. Interference with nature is the condition

     <pb id="p.59" n="59"/>
 of civilization. It is not natural to
exist between a paving-stone and a canopy
of smoke.  But this is the condition of
millions of poor souls who, under brighter
circumstances, could enjoy the gentians
of the<placeName key="Alps"> Alps</placeName> or the waters of the<placeName key="Riviera"> Riviera</placeName>
as keenly as their critics. As things are
marching now, non-interference with nature
is hurrying the nation to disorder by the
wholesale production of people who rarely
wash or change their clothes; who are
subject to prolonged and irregular intervals
between meals; who breathe tainted air in
insanitary hovels, and who are in a more
decrepid condition of mind and body than the
heathen in foreign parts before we extended
to them the advantages of brandy, Bible, and
the diseases of advanced civilization.
In <date value="1885">1885</date> a Committee sat at the Mansion
House to inquire into the causes of
permanent distress in London, and the best means
of remedying the same.</p><p>
The Committee was representative, and
contained some distinguished names. The
following forms part of the Report:-
</p><p>" There appear to be grounds for believing
that the increase of the population (with or

<pb id="p.60" n="60"/>
without marriage) is greatest in those classes
which have the least means of supporting
large families. And this increase is due quite
as much to the early age at which many
become parents as to the number of children
brought into the world without any provision
for their maintenance. In the result it would
appear that the undue increase of the
population is closely connected with extreme
destitution. The question of early marriages is a
very important one as regards both morality
and pauperism, and the matter might be
profitably investigated."</p><p>
After so specific an opinion, it might
be presumed that the Committee came to
deal with the question of remedies for
permanent distress in London. Not a bit of it.
The subject was ignored. The logical
corollary of such an expression of opinion would
have been a recommendation that an inquiry
(by <orgName key="Royal Commission">Royal Commission</orgName> or otherwise is
desirable) into the effect of early and reckless
marriages as well as into the connection
between the undue increase of population and
destitution.</p><p>
It is desirable, therefore, in order to
sterilize the unfit-</p><p>

    <pb id="p.61" n="61"/>
</p><p>1. That the legal age of marriage should
be raised.
</p><p>2. That reckless marriages should be
prevented -
</p><p>(a) By requiring from male minors previous
to the celebration of marriage evidence of
ability to maintain a family.
</p><p>(b) By an Act of Parliament enabling
clergy and registrars to refuse to act for
reasons stated.
</p><p>3. Permanent segregation by the State of
criminals after repeated conviction.
</p><p>4. Change of example and precept by the
clergy, and the creation of a healthy public
opinion in regard to the responsibility of
adults for children begotten by them.

the effect of early and reckless marriages,
and their connection with destitution.

CHAPTER IV: Emigration</head>
<p>
THERE is no subject relating to the
wellbeing of the community in regard to which it
is easier to generalise than the question of
emigration. At first sight it seems as though
emigration, and enough of it, were a panacea
for the greater portion of the national evil
caused by the pressure of our population.
When, however, the subject is analysed in
detail, it is found to be wedged round with a
variety of political and economical difficulties,
to be grappled with only by the community
as a whole.</p><p>
It is an axiom among those who are accustomed

            <pb id="p.65" n="65"/>
 to apply themselves to matters relating
to the well-being of their fellow countrymen,
that the truest philanthropy is that in which
the capital expended is returned. The
enterprises of the late <persName key="Peabody, Mr. George">Mr. George Peabody</persName> and of
<persName key="Waterlow, Sir Sidney">Sir Sydney Waterlow</persName> are but examples of the
truth of this general observation; and, unless
it could be shown that money expended,
either by individuals or by the nation, in
facilitating discriminate emigration is either
directly or indirectly reproductive, I should
not include the subject of emigration as one
of the means of liquidating our national debt.
The attitude adopted towards the subject
of emigration varies according to the situation
and interests of the observers. In England
the question has been regarded almost
exclusively from the philanthropic point of
view. The spectacle of congested cities, of
the thousands of unemployed, and the always
shameful, because unnecessary, scenes of
hundreds of able-bodied men clamouring at
the dock gates for work which does not
exist, has directed public attention to the
feasibility of removing these unfortunates to
another land, as an effective method of

<pb id="p.66" n="66"/>
extirpating evils which are continually under
process of generation.</p><p>
One result of these philanthropic intentions
has been to create in late years, in the Anglo-Saxon
 colonies, and in the <placeName key="United States">United
States</placeName>which is the saucer into which the European
cup has overflowed since <date value="1820">1820</date>-a feeling of
repugnance and dread of large schemes of
immigration, measurable only in intensity with
the sentiment excited in <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>, or in <placeName key="South
Africa">South
Africa</placeName> in past times, when the mother country
reversed the policy of the pelican, by feeding
her colonies, not with the best of her blood,
but with the rejected elements of her people.
That this sense of wrong at the idea of
Britain shedding her paupers on other lands
is in existence, and is growing, there can be
no question. We are met, therefore, with
the initial fact that, whatever may be the
destination of the pauper population of our
great cities, our colonies not only will not
encourage its transfer to their own shores, but
will resist by every means in their power any
misguided attempts in that direction.</p><p>
The recent action of the American
Government in regard to the introduction of pauper

           <pb id="p.67" n="67"/>
immigrants is well-known. At <placeName key="Castle Garden">Castle Garden</placeName>,
the landing place of the immigrants to <placeName key="New
York">New
York</placeName>, an investigation is made by officers of
the Customs Department as to the ability of
the immigrants to pay their passages to the
interior of the country, and to support
themselves for a reasonable period of time. The
result of this examination has been still further
to diminish British emigration for the year
<date value="1885">1885</date>, the falling off in that year being 38,915,
as compared with <date value="1884">1884</date>. It is impossible not
to sympathise with those beyond sea who
decline to allow the Anglo-Saxon colonies to
be treated as receptacles for the failures and
for the unfit of British industrial life. That
this feeling is deeply rooted needs no
demonstration. Of its justice no facts can be more
telling than the analysis of a given number,
say, of the London unemployed who are
candidates for emigration. During the winter of
<date value="1884">1884</date>-5, I happened to be brought closely in
contact with about 6,000 unemployed men
in <placeName key="East End">the East End</placeName>, and I have no hesitation in
expressing my conviction that not more than
4&#x00BD; per cent. of their number were eligible for
a new life in the colonies. A large proportion

<pb id="p.68" n="68"/>
of these 6,000 were men who had, during a
comparatively recent period of time, come to
London in search of work; and it is
remarkable that the small proportion of those who
were adjudged by competent authorities as fit
for emigration had, for the most part, but
lately left the country districts.
</p><p>These two facts, therefore; of colonial
repugnance to receive the surplus population of
British cities, and the unfitness of the majority
of those whose presence forms a burden and
danger to our social life, indicate that if the
question of emigration is to be regarded as a
remedial agent, and from a national point of
view, the remedy must be applied before the
individuals to be emigrated have sunk into the
semi-nomadic conditions of casual labour in
the great cities; before habits of continuous
application have been lost, and before physique
and morale alike are injured beyond hope of
repair.</p><p>
If these conclusions are accepted as
tenable it is clear that the appeals for support
made by some of the Emigration Societies
are based on ignorance of the facts. The
following extract from the prospectus of the

                   <pb id="p.69" n="69"/>
<orgName key="National Association for Promoting State-Directed
 Colonization ">National Association for Promoting State-Directed Colonization </orgName>is an excellent example
of the injury that may be done by unhealthy
generalities expressed in philanthropic
English. The Association enjoys the advantage
of seventeen eminent Patrons, fifty-two Vice-Presidents
, as well as a National Council of
portentous proportions.</p><p>
<quote rend="blockquote">In East and South London, in many of our large cities
and towns, and in some of the rural districts, there are
accumulating rapidly-increasing masses of poverty-stricken,
unemployed people. Perpetual anxiety, due to the terrible
struggle for daily bread, enforced privation, overcrowding,
miseries too many for enumeration, aggravated by
corrupting influences surrounding the poor in all cities and
manufacturing towns, are steadily visibly sapping and
ruining the physical constitutions and energies of
deserving, struggling, and helpless people, while discontent is
leavening masses to whose doors education is now carried
by the State. These people, now becoming educated, see
luxury all around them. It is well that philanthropists,
philosophers, and statesmen should ignore the palpable
danger of such a condition of things ? The evil is being
intensified yearly by the increase in population, and by the
rapid, though unavoidable introduction of labour-saving
machinery in all departments of trade and agriculture.
There is only one permanent remedy-a steady and
continuous drafting of our surplus population to our own
Colonies, where these people would become contented and
useful to the British Empire, instead of remaining here, a
starving, discontented menace to the mother-country.

<pb id="p.70" n="70"/>
Yet that remedy is quite beyond the reach of those in
whose behalf State intervention is demanded-demanded
not alone on grounds of charity or duty towards them, but
in the interests of the whole community.
This Association has initiated a National Movement,
with a view of inducing the Home and Colonial
Governments to join hands in a work of mercy for our starving
poor. The Colonies will gain by securing the supply of
population they so much require; the people themselves
will be infinitely advantaged by the removal. At home we
have thousands with no work, no wages, no food, a
constant burden upon our philanthropy and our rates. In our
Colonies there are millions of untilled acres, the settlement
and cultivation of which will provide an abundance of
work, good wages, and cheap food. Yet, year after year,
these thousands of willing but miserable people remain
penned up in the courts and alleys of our cities and towns.
All that is wanting is <hi rend="italics">the means to transplant these helpless
ones from here to there</hi>. They will go, if we will only
enable them to do so.</quote></p><p>
The paragraphs quoted, italics included,
are better adapted to defeat the efforts of the
Federation League, to create a cry for
separation, to stimulate the appetite for official
obstruction, and to encourage socialism, than to
carry into effect such practical measures as
can be undertaken with due regard to political
perspective.</p><p>
Emigration has failed to touch, in recent
years, the evils caused by the prevailing lack

            <pb id="p.71" n="71"/>
of employment, created by dwindling value
and fluctuating volume of trade-and more
especially by the enormous increase in the
population of Great Britain. Such
emigration as has taken place has been partly
indiscriminate.  During the year <date value="1884">1884</date>, when
242,000 people of British origin left these
islands, there was an influx during the same
year, from all sources, of not less than 91,356.
Of this number a large proportion were
returned emigrants who had failed to make
good their grip on the place selected for their
attempt to obtain a livelihood.</p><p>
Absence of authentic information as to the
capabilities of the  districts  selected for
settlement in the Colonies and elsewhere
is the principal cause of these unsuccessful
ventures.  The statements of agents and
others, who are chiefly concerned in
procuring the transport of a certain tonnage of
emigrants over lines of railway with land to
sell, have led to the destruction of many
hopes, and the permanent ruin of many lives.
</p><p>The mere possession of 160 acres of land
in the Colonies, without the essential
knowledge, strength, or capital, is no greater boon

<pb id="p.72" n="72"/>
than the acquisition of the now historical three
acres and a cow is in England itself, when
the possessor has neither time, ability, nor
capital to develop the potential advantages of
the land.</p><p>
The glut of artisans in England represents
a state of things prevailing nearly all over the
world; and the transfer of carpenters' and
builders' labourers to places where the
demand for those forms of industry is below the
supply available on the spot, is simply a
rearrangement of suffering, and is attended with
no corresponding advantage.</p><p>
A second cause of the comparative failure
of recent emigration to cope with the volume
of English distress, is the absence of adequate
capital. There are in London, at this moment,
sixty emigration societies and agencies bravely
struggling with the task of meeting the
necessity of the case, some of which have done and
are doing good and noble work, however
limited in extent that work may be.</p><p>
It is not surprising that capitalists hold
aloof from the expenditure of large sums of
money where the competition for their
support is so keen, the results of the work accomplished

         <pb id="p.73" n="73"/>
 so comparatively insignificant, and
where special and expert knowledge of the
subject by the administration is by no means
a matter of course.</p><p>
From investigations made in <date value="1885">1885</date>, it
appears that twenty-five of the societies referred
to succceeded in sending away no more than
3,500 individuals at a cost of &#x00A3;13,000. When
it is remembered that not less than &#x00A3;4,500,000
are annually expended in public charities in
the metropolis alone-which sum would
provide &#x00A3;20 each for every one of the 200,000
human beings forming the submerged stratum
of London life-the diversion of a moderate
proportion of this enormous sum from the
temporary relief of the necessitous to the
permanent assistance of the able and the
deserving, by means of emigration, would be,
in all senses, a more productive use of the
money.</p><p>
Considerable efforts were made, in <date value="1885">1885</date>,
under good auspices, to induce the
representatives of the societies to form a Bund or
Central Council, in which information might be
focussed, and to which the gifts or loans for
emigration purposes of the charitably disposed

<pb id="p.74" n="74"/>
 might be entrusted.  These efforts
were not successful.  Permanent officials
withheld their approval.</p><p>
Hitherto information in regard to the
absorbtive capacities of the different colonies
has been acquired by the disunited energies
of societies or individuals. As there are ten
Agents-Generals in London more or less
interested in discouraging unwise emigration,
superfluous work is involved both to them
and to their correspondents and visitors, by
the absence of a centre where exact
information can be concentrated and dealt out.</p><p>
An inquiry, however, at the Agents-Generals'
offices does not appear to exhaust the well of
truth as to the capacity of the colonies to
receive suitable members of the British
community. Democracy now reigns supreme in
the Anglo-Saxon colonies. It is not surprising,
therefore, that the protective policy, which is
all but universal, extends not only to the
exclusion of Chinese labour, but to all measures
likely to lead to the reduction of wages.</p><p>
The ambassadors of the colonies in question
are debarred, therefore, from taking part in
any movement which shall prejudice the interests

          <pb id="p.75" n="75"/>
 of the wage-earning classes, who now
form the bulk of colonial constituencies. That
this is so, is, however, no reason why a serious
and continuous effort should not be made to
ascertain from month to month the actual
condition of agricultural and other industry
in and near every large town in every colony
over which floats the British flag. I may,
perhaps, adduce a practical instance of the
importance and interest of local inquiry. The
Representative of the <placeName key="Cape Colony">Cape Colony</placeName> is no
longer in a position to promote emigration
to <placeName key="South Africa">South Africa</placeName>, as the <orgName key="Cape Parliament ">Cape Parliament </orgName>has
rescinded the emigration vote. Detailed
inquiry in the <placeName key="Cape Colony">Cape Colony</placeName>, however, reveals
the fact that, although some of the finest
wheat in the world is grown in <placeName key="South Africa">South Africa</placeName>,
the colony is importing food-stuffs for internal
consumption to the amount of &#x00A3;1,020,000 a
year, and that, consequently, the introduction
of agricultural labour, at least sufficient to
produce food-stuffs to that extent, would be
of benefit to the <placeName key="Cape Colony">Cape Colony</placeName>, whatever the
result might be to the mother country or to
the emigrants themselves.</p><p>
Take, again, the instance of <placeName key="New South
Wales.">New South
Wales.</placeName>
<pb id="p.76" n="76"/>
The following is an extract of a letter
which appeared in the <title>Pall Mall Gazette</title> of
 <date value="1884-06-21">21st June,1884</date>:-</p><p>
<quote rend="blockquote"><orgName key="NEW   SOUTH  WALES EMIGRATION">NEW   SOUTH  WALES EMIGRATION</orgName>.-The demand for
agricultural labour of all sorts is still largely in excess of
supply. The amount of genuine distress in the country
may be estimated by the fact that the 'starving
unemployed' have refused to accept 5s. a day on temporary
Government relief works. The country is simply crying
out for men, and it is pitiable to see the short-sighted
efforts of those who are honestly attempting to dissuade
English workmen from throwing in their lot there.</quote>
</p><p>This is how Mr. Froude, in his new book
"Oceana,"     describes   <placeName key="Auckland, New
Zealand">Auckland, New
Zealand</placeName>:-
</p><p><quote rend="blockquote">Eight shillings a day are the usual wages, and no
ablebodied man who wants employment is ever at a loss to
find it at that rate of pay. Beef is thought dear at
sixpence a pound, bread is not dearer than in England, while
fruit and vegetables are as much cheaper as they are
superior in quality. The ' four eights' is an accomplished
fact-eight hours to work, eight to play, eight to sleep,
and eight shillings a day.</quote></p><p>
It is not surprising to read a little further on
that the workmen " discourage immigration"
as tending to lower their wages. This seems
to be the result of extensive public works,
affording unlimited employment, paid for by
enormous loans raised at cheap rates in

          <pb id="p.77" n="77"/>
England; and the workmen, being in the
majority, can have their own way about the
immigration.</p><p>
It may, then, be fairly assumed that a case
is made out for independent inquiry on the
spot as to the condition of the local labour
markets in the colonies. There is no doubt
a continuous stream of valuable information
pouring into the letter-boxes of the various
emigration societies, and of individuals
interested in the work of emigration. But the
first step in a national scheme of emigration
would be to combine these rivulets of
knowledge, and to filter and compare them in order
that they may be made of the greatest use to
the community; and, furthermore, they
require to be supplemented by the patriotic
support of residents on the spot. If approached
with tact and address, an individual or
committee in every town of our colonial
possessions will probably be found willing to support,
by trustworthy and impartial monthly reports,
the emigration bureau of centralised
information, which it is to be hoped will be formed by
the Government without loss of time.</p><p>
Before such a bureau is in a position to

<pb id="p.78" n="78"/>
satisfy the demand for accurate knowledge, it
would be necessary for one or two competent
individuals to visit <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName> and the Cape,
properly accredited by the Government, for
the purpose of enlisting the aid of volunteer
helpers in the colonies, not only for the supply
of trustworthy information, but for the
honourable and patriotic purpose of advising and
assisting those who leave England for the
first time.</p><p>
The present sources of knowledge do not
exhaust the supply of facts; they are
available to few; are often fragmentary,
sometimes obsolete, and, not seldom, lead to
indiscriminate emigration, and consequently
to suffering, and disappointment.

With regard to the <orgName key="Australian Colonies">Australian Colonies</orgName>

the bulk of which are wage-earners, for these


<pb id="p.82" n="82"/>
latter will undoubtedly be affected by the
immigration of competitors from England
and <placeName key="Scotland">Scotland</placeName>.</p><p>
The information thus collected by the
Bureau will require to be condensed, tabulated,
and distributed.  For the latter work the
cooperation of the <orgName key="Post-Office Department">Post-Office Department</orgName>
should be ensured. It will also be well to
publish information by means of semi-official
printed notices to be displayed in selected
rural and urban post-offices. The use of the
telegraph for the dissemination of
information should be allowed, at all events in cases
of urgency and importance.</p><p>
The advantage of this system over the
present competitive muddle will be that the
information supplied will be official, impartial,
and true, instead of irresponsible, imaginative,
or obsolete, as is now too often the case.
As the Bureau will occasionally obtain
information of a deterrent character, warnings
against the emigration of artizans or labourers
to overstocked localities should form a special
feature among the duties devolving on this
Department.</p><p>
Much has been said and written of late

        <pb id="p.83" n="83"/>
about the federation of Britain with her
Colonies. There is no way in which the true
federation of the Empire can be more
practically aided than by a union with our kin
beyond sea for the purpose of developing their
land and assisting ours. Work such as this
lies beyond the province of a Government
department. That the task is one capable of
achievement, the example of the Cape Colony
and of Canada-to which I shall allude further
on-affords grounds for hope.</p><p>
The next point indispensable to the success
of a national scheme is the possession of
funds. Bewildered by the multiplicity of
demands for support, the English public has
held aloof from the emigration movement.
The subscription of &#x00A3;13,000 in one year from
the whole of the metropolis does not suggest
the idea of conviction being rooted in the
public mind that the advantages, commercial
or otherwise, of promoting wise emigration on
a large scale, are such as to warrant serious
efforts for the purpose. In the year <date value="1884">1884</date>-5,
&#x00A3;457,716 were expended in London on 92
Institutions for General Relief, Food
Institutions, Loan Charities, and Homes. Investigation

<pb id="p.84" n="84"/>
 into the outcome of this expenditure,
either to the individuals relieved, or to the
nation at large, is disappointing to those who
look for solid and permanent results.</p><p>
Having regard, then, to the enormous sums
laid out for transient advantages to suffering
individuals, it does not seem Quixotic to
expect that an appeal to the nation for means
to convert those who now are, or will be, a
burden to their fellow-countrymen, into
selfsupporting communities across the sea-
consumers of large quantities of the products
manufactured by those left behind-would fall
on deaf ears.</p><p>
The facility with which the cry for Imperial
funds is raised is fascinating to those who do
not reflect that any such addition to the
burdens of the State paves the way to the
assumption of tasks, not only more amenable
to private enterprise, but which are in fact and
essence foreign to the theory of constitutional
government itself.</p><p>
If, however, no case as yet has been made
out for subventions from the State for
colonisation, undertaken with the philanthropic
object of relieving pressure at home, it is conceivable

           <pb id="p.85" n="85"/>
 that cases have arisen, and even
exist, where State colonisation may be a
cheap and effective alternative to a military
solution of burning  questions.  The old
system of military settlers is now discontinued,
but who can doubt that but for the
settlements in <placeName key="South Africa">South Africa</placeName> of <dateRange from="1820" to="1857">1820-1857</dateRange>,
illmanaged as they were-so far as the
management attempted in the United Kingdom is
concerned-the incessant and costly burdens
laid on the mother country during the last
twenty years would have been even heavier
still. The British taxpayer has spent about
&#x00A3; 18,000,000 on <placeName key="South Africa">South Africa</placeName> wars since
the year <date value="1870">1870</date>, an expenditure caused by
the neglect of Bacon's apothegm :-
</p><p><quote rend="blockquote">"It is the sinfullest thing in the world to forsake or
destitute a plantation once in forwardness; for, besides
the dishonour, it is the guiltiness of blood of many
commiserable persons."</quote></p><p>
The settlement of the Eastern Province in
<date value="1820">1820</date>, at the charges of the British exchequer,
has again and again saved the vulnerable side
of the Cape Colony from being " eaten up "
by " man-slaying machines" from the east
and north. This being so, the conclusion is

<pb id="p.86" n="86"/>
irresistible that the wise expenditure by
England during the last thirty years of a million
of money for colonising purposes, would not
only have saved the outlay of the greater part
of the vast sum wasted in wars, which have
settled nothing, and pleased no one but the
contractors, but would have created a large
and permanent demand for British
manufactures.</p><p>
The recent expedition to <placeName key="Bechuanaland">Bechuanaland</placeName>,
involving an expenditure of over a million
sterling, has left a country the size of <placeName key="Spain">Spain</placeName>
to fortuitous development, and to the chances
of Boer energies and leisure. Beyond the
resources of private enterprise, the
colonisation of <placeName key="Bechuanaland">Bechuanaland</placeName> by Great Britain, at a
cost of &#x00A3;125,000, not for the purpose of
relieving home distress, nor even with the object
of creating a new market for British trade,
but to stock with settlers of British and loyal
Dutch blood a land coveted by those who
regard not their neighbours' landmark, in the
opinion of those on the spot most competent
to judge, would secure for the British
taxpayer an assurance of peace and rest from
which, under present circumstances, he is

        <pb id="p.87" n="87"/>
only too likely again to be disturbed. And
when this disturbance does arise, it should
be remembered that the sword cannot be
effectively drawn 1,000 miles in the interior of
Africa for half a quarter of a million of money.
England has now assumed a responsibility for
<placeName key="Bechuanaland">Bechuanaland</placeName> which belongs to her whether
she recognises or evades her inalienable
engagements to white men and black. The
alternative accordingly is offered either of
making a moderate expenditure for a special
purpose, which shall be as final in its way as
was the cost of the colony of <date value="1820">1820</date>, or of
incurring liabilities which accumulate at
compound interest while England sleeps.
</p><p>Such an expenditure in <placeName key="Bechuanaland">Bechuanaland</placeName>
gratuitously made to the settlers chosen,
would, in the course of time, pay itself. There
was a married couple named Cawood who
went, in <date value="1820">1820</date>, to the Cape Colony, in the
ship John, in Hazelhurst's party. There are
now 500 descendants of the original Cawoods
in the Cape Colony, consuming to the amount
of &#x00A3;1,500 to &#x00A3;1,600 a year of British
products.  The annual profit to the mother
country on the consumption of the Cawoods

<pb id="p.88" n="88"/>
exceeds the original cost of their settlement
by the British Government. While it cannot
be expected that every couple will be as
profitable or as prolific as the Cawoods, their
debt to the Government of the day has been
more than discharged by the stability they
have contributed to the colony, by the work
they have created for artisans and spinners
in the old country, and by the indirect
advantages of every kind, arising from their
having taken root in <placeName key="South Africa">South Africa</placeName>. An old
writer has said " that the planting of countries
is like planting of woods, for you must take
account to lose almost twenty years' profit,
and expect your profit in the end."
</p><p>The financial aid of the State should
accordingly be sought only in such exceptional
cases as those now presented by the <placeName key="Bechuanaland">Bechuanaland</placeName> or <placeName key="Zululand">Zululand</placeName> problems, and then only
as affording the cheapest and most effective
means of meeting inalienable responsibilities
incurred toward the country requiring
settlement, and not in any sense from philanthropic
motives, which, however laudable in the
individual, have no place in the machinery of
Government.</p><p>

           <pb id="p.89" n="89"/>
Such problems present the dilemma of
cannon or colonisation; and as the cannon
solution is more costly, less permanent, and
is productive of ill-feeling all round, the other
horn of the dilemma appears on the whole
preferable.</p><p>
The destination of emigrants is of the
highest importance to the best interests of
British commerce. In <date value="1884">1884</date>, 155,280 people
of British origin left for the <placeName key="United States">United States</placeName>,
and when there, consumed, per capita, an
average of 10s. worth of British manufactures,
making an annual consumption of &#x00A3;77,640
of British goods. The same year, 44,255
left for <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName> and <placeName key="New Zealand">New Zealand</placeName>, where,
according to the average scale of
consumption ruling in <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>, they became at once
annual customers for British goods to the
amount of &#x00A3;352,000  per annum. In other
words, two Australian immigrants, as
customers to Great Britain, are equal to
thirtythree subjects of the <placeName key="United States">United States</placeName>.  An
emigrant to South Africa is, commercially,
six times more valuable than an emigrant to
the States. That trade follows the flag is
often said, but the force and extent to which

<pb id="p.90" n="90"/>
the British flag is pursued by British trade
is not so clearly a matter of common
knowledge.</p><p>
If the facts stated are sufficient to induce
patriotic citizens to provide adequate funds
for a considerable increase to discriminate
emigration, it is clear that there must be
some national body or council unconnected,
as a whole, with any special interest, faith, or
society. A national emigration Council should
by no means engage in the details of sending
emigrants away. To do so would involve the
creation of yet another competitor in the
bewildering crowd of claimants for public money.
The function of the Council should be to
receive funds from the public and distribute them
impartially to societies and individuals who
have  proved  themselves  competent and
economical in the transaction of previous
emigration business. Representatives of the
principal societies would naturally form an
important part of the council, and the first
step towards federation for executive purposes
would thus be taken. All the existing
associations are hampered for want of funds, and
any legitimate means which would increase

        <pb id="p.91" n="91"/>
revenue without involving interference could
not but be regarded with favour by them. The
national council being, through the Bureau of
Information, in full possession of the views
and various needs of the Colonies, would
either stimulate or check the outflow of
labour as circumstances may demand, and
reduce to a minimum the scandal and
suffering caused by ignorance on the part of the
emigrant himself.</p><p>
The other objects of the council would be
as follows :</p><p>
1. To place itself in constant
communication with the <orgName key="Colonial Office">Colonial Office</orgName> in London, with
the <orgName key="Agents-General">Agents-General</orgName>, and with agents
appointed for the purpose in the Colonies.
</p><p>2. To obtain assistance from persons or
societies in the Colonies, who will undertake
to receive and place emigrants and their
families.
</p><p>3. And generally to ascertain from time
to time the limits within which
emigration from the United Kingdom can be
conducted.
</p><p>4. Having thus ascertained the possible
"openings" for emigrants, to place such

<pb id="p.92" n="92"/>
openings at the  disposal of the various
existing local agencies.
</p><p>5. To receive funds, and to distribute them
among local agencies.
</p><p>6. The council should not attempt to
make centralisation take the place of the
personal care and minute attention to
details which smaller local associations alone
can give, but leave them to adopt their own
system of work, subject to such conditions
as the council may from time to time think
desirable.
</p><p>7. The council itself not to undertake any
emigration, but if it appears that the demand
for emigrants at any time seems likely to be
in excess of the supply, to organise new local
committees to do the work.
The existence of a national council would
also be of use in the following
ways:a. As the channel of communication with
the Imperial Government.
</p><p>b. As the channel of communication with
the Colonial Governments, and in particular to
apply to them for (1) free or assisted passages;
(2) reduced rail fares; (3) immigration agency
in the Colonies, including further efforts to obtain

              <pb id="p.93" n="93"/>
 openings for emigrants, and facilities on
their landing.</p><p>
And generally, the existence of such a
council would be likely to inspire confidence
in the charitable public, and thus to increase
the subscriptions available for emigration.
Although England is the only country in
Europe to which a national scheme of
emigration is either feasible or profitable, there are
some points in the practice of other emigrating
nations which are not without interest in the
study of this question.<note place="foot" n="2">The following details are the result of personal
investigations on the Continent.</note></p><p>
<title><placeName key="GERMANY.">GERMANY.</placeName></title>
The influence of certain land systems in
affecting emigration is shown by the province
of <placeName key="Mecklenburg-Strelitz">Mecklenburg-Strelitz</placeName>. The area is 1,130
English square miles, and the whole
ownership of the territory is divided between the
Grand Duke, feudal proprietors, and the
corporations of certain towns, in the following
manner-527 square miles to the Grand Duke,
353 to the nobles, and 117 to the town
corporations. The population, although only oo to
<pb id="p.94" n="94"/>
the square mile, is less in <placeName key="Mecklenburg-Strelitz">Mecklenburg-Strelitz</placeName>
than any other State of the <orgName key="German Empire">German Empire</orgName>;
the average density of the population in which
is 213 to the square mile. Owing to the
manner in which the land is held, the
emigration from <placeName key="Mecklenburg">Mecklenburg</placeName> is proportionately to
the population three times as great as is
the case in <placeName key="Saxony">Saxony</placeName>, which is the State most
densely populated in the Empire.
Emigration from <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName> is discouraged,
and when, as is the case in some parts of
Mecklenburg<placeName key="Mecklenburg">Mecklenburg</placeName>, districts are depopulated, the
discouragement by the Government is
displayed by the adoption of strong measures.
The principal causes of emigration from
<placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName> are, undoubtedly, the fear of war,
the hatred of military service, the crowded
condition of every department of industry, and the
immense competition for employment caused
by the 160,000 soldiers who are yearly thrown
on the world; and for whose sake, it is said on
good authority, <persName key="Prince Bismarck">Prince Bismarck</persName> acquired for
the State the control of the railways.
The comparative success of German
emigrants, as compared with those of our own
country, may be attributed to the facts-firstly,

         <pb id="p.95" n="95"/>
that the standard of comfort in <placeName
key="Germany">Germany</placeName> is lower than that ruling in England;
and, secondly, that as a family seldom or
never emigrates without some small provision
in the way of capital, the sufferings arising
from pauper emigration are practically
obviated. <orgName key="The German Government">The German Government</orgName>, like the
English, take especial pains to ensure the
comfort and well-being of the emigrants on
board ship.</p><p>
But the policy of protection, which in <placeName
key="Germany">Ger
many</placeName> is as comprehensive and far-reaching as
the military system itself, is developing year
by year. One of these developments is a
provision which will shortly come into force,
by which the steamers conveying German
emigrants must be fitted in such a way as will
conflict with the regulations laid down by the
<orgName key="English Board of Trade">English Board of Trade</orgName>, and which will
consequently prevent the conveyance of German
and English emigrants by the same vessel.
</p><p>Emigration agents at <placeName key="Hamburg">Hamburg</placeName> and <placeName key="Bremen">Bremen</placeName> have to deposit 18,000 marks in the
hands of the Government, which are liable to
forfeiture if by false and misleading
representations they consign settlers to unhealthy

<pb id="p.96" n="96"/>
parts of the world where success is
impossible.</p><p>
While the <orgName key="German Government">German Government</orgName> discourages
emigration as a whole, they are doing all they
can to promote the settlement of their own
recently acquired colonies.</p><p>
</p><p>New regulations of a restrictive nature will
shortly be issued by <placeName key="Germany">Germany</placeName>, and this being
known stimulates emigration, for many towns
of <orgName key="Red Church">the Red Church</orgName> are under martial law. Unmarried
men can be ejected at twelve hours' notice,
and married men at twenty-four hours' notice;
a dangerous precedent for <orgName key="Red Church">the Red Church</orgName>, when it
is remembered that there are now 23,000
immigrant Germans in London alone. The
nations of Europe cannot fail to remember the
action of <orgName key="Red Church">the Red Church</orgName> with reference to the Jews
and Poles, on their eastern border, should
occasion arise. It is not too much to say
that half the emigrants from German ports are
of the Jewish faith. They have an hereditary
dislike to military service, and are more prone
to apply themselves to commercial pursuits
than to bear arms, though recent events in
<placeName key="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</placeName> supply instances of an opposite
nature.</p><p>

          <pb id="p.97" n="97"/>
The greatest depression in <orgName key="Red Church">the Red Church</orgName> is
followed, as elsewhere, by the greatest
emigration, and it is interesting to observe that the
tax on corn already presses heavily on the
lower classes.</p><p>
The average actual number of young men
drawn from the ordinary conditions of service
in the army is 160,000, besides 5,000 who
enter as volunteers for one year, and 5,000 for
the marine.</p><p>
The total population of the <orgName key="Empire of
Germany">Empire of
Germany</orgName> in <date value="1882">1882</date> was 45,213,000; and 3,000,000
Germans have emigrated to the <placeName key="United States">United States</placeName>
since <date value="1820">1820</date>.
There is hardly any emigration either to
British North America or to <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>; in
<date value="1881">1881</date>, for example, while 206,000
Germans went to the <placeName key="United States">United States</placeName>, only 286
went to British North America and 745 to
<placeName key="Australia.">Australia.</placeName>
The loss by emigration from <orgName key="Red Church">the Red Church</orgName> is
estimated at not less than &#x00A3;30,000,000, as
the emigrants, when settled in their new
country, are purchasers of German
manufactures and produce to a very trifling extent; it
need hardly be pointed out that this is not
<pb id="p.98" n="98"/>
the case when Englishmen go to English
colonies.</p><p>
The military system is the means by which
the<orgName key=" German Government"> German Government</orgName> retain a hold on
individuals and prevent able-bodied men from
quitting the fatherland.</p><p>
The Chancellor justifies his action in regard
to the forthcoming restrictions and changes in
the arrangements for shipping interests, by
the plea that, as there must be a certain amount of emigration, it is well to keep it in
German hands-that is in German ships.</p><p>
Much trouble is caused to the <orgName key="German
Home Secretary">German
Home Secretary</orgName>, as well as to the <orgName key="Imperial
Commissioner">Imperial
Commissioner</orgName> for emigration matters,
stationed at <placeName key="Hamburg ">Hamburg </placeName>(which gentleman is
directly under the control of the Home
Minister).  The opinion of leading circles
appears to be that it will be best to avoid
an encouragement of whatever character
as regards emigration, and consequently it
has diminished within the last few years.
The number of young Germans attempting
to escape military duty is comparatively
limited; statistics show the correctness of
this statement.

                  <pb id="p.99" n="99"/>
In <date value="1884">1884</date> the emigrants carried with them
about 20,000 children (under 10 years), who,
of course, went with     their parents.    This
proves that the majority of the 45,600 male
emigrants (above 10 years) must have been
married men, who had served their time in the
army. The emigration of young men between
the ages from   17 to 25 is strictly forbidden
by German law; all vessels leaving <placeName
key="Hamb
urg">Hamburg</placeName> are watched by the police on this
account.</p><p>
There exists no Imperial Act regulating
emigration matters, but almost all States have
their local statutes, by which the transactions
of emigration agents are supervised most
carefully.</p><p>
The following is an extract from the Borsen

instructions, shall lose their licenses. At the same time the
agents are strictly ordered to abstain from taking part in

and in <date value="1884">1884</date>--91,603. The two heaviest years were
<date value="1881">1881</date>-2, the  numbers   being  123,ooo  and  113,200
respectively. The emigrants are from all classes, the
labouring class furnishing the largest contribution, and
those without occupation coming next. The provinces of
Pomerania, Prussia (East and West), and Schleswig-Holstein
 would appear to be the largest contributors.  In
<date value="1884">1884</date>, of the total number of 75,264 direct emigrants,
71,843 went to the United States; 1,738 to Brazil, &amp;c.,
769 to <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>, 604 to other South American States, and
107 to Asia. Of persons over 10 years, in <date value="1884">1884</date>, there

years there were some 20,000. Of these, 33,059 were
single men, 8,901 single females, and 14,206 families.
The raison d'&#x00EA;tre for emigrating is difficult to say. The
German authorities strenuously deny that the military
system has any influence in promoting the desire, and
quote in proof of this that the greater number of those
going out of the country are time-served men, but assert
that the real raison d'&#x00EA;tre is to better themselves, and urge
in proof of this, that large numbers of the labouring class,
who, not being able to attain to the luxury of a cottage
and plot of land here, say, ' We will emigrate.' Yet the
figures quoted show a very large number of single men;

<pb id="p.102" n="102"/>
of course, there are no means of verifying how many of
these are time-served men. I have not the smallest
hesitation in believing that the idea of rising in the social
scale, and the magnificent will-o'-the-wisp idea of
becoming a peasant proprietor, are two powerful motives in
inducing them to emigrate, but without facts and figures,
I cannot assert that military pressure-whatever I may
believe-exercises any influence. I have known individual
cases."</quote></p><p>

<placeName key="Norway">Norway</placeName>, which     is mainly   directed  to the
United   States, to a very    small degree to
Canada, while none at all reaches the other
English colonies. The principal cause is the
want of agricultural employment, and the
emigrants are therefore almost exclusively
peasants and servant girls. Many of them
are peasant proprietors, and realize the value
of their small properties before leaving
<placeName key="Norway">Norway</placeName>, and do not, as is the case with a
similar class in England, drift into the large
towns. The population increases with
considerable rapidity, but in <placeName key="Norway">Norway</placeName> alone,
among European countries, is the whole social
question solved by emigration. There being
no large towns, there is none of that magnetic

            <pb id="p.103" n="103"/>
attraction of a great mass which presents so
difficult a problem in our own country. On
the other hand, the standard of comfort
throughout the country is lower than that
prevailing in England, and there is
comparatively no social or political discontent among
the working classes.</p><p>
There appears to be a general and
intelligent understanding that the law of natural
increase must be met by swarming to other
hives, and not by political agitation for a
readjustment of property. There is no
discontent with the land system as it is, nor
with the obligation to military service. Such
pressure as does exist is that of want, and the
minds of the people are not obscured by
Socialistic teachings which inflame the
residuum in countries of greater wealth.
The healthy character of Norwegian
emigration is shown by the success attending the
efforts of those who leave their country;
secondary emigration being caused by those
who, having succeeded in America, transmit
funds to <placeName key="Norway">Norway</placeName>, to enable their friends to
join them in their new home; there is little or
no pauper emigration, most of the people

<pb id="p.104" n="104"/>
taking a little money with them. Their
standard of comfort at home being low, they
are not disappointed with the inevitable
hardships and privations attending pioneer effort
in a settlement; it may be added that there
are few or no unemployed artizans.</p><p>

</p><p>The increase of population for the years
<dateRange from="1881" to="1884">1881-4</dateRange> was about 96,000, and the actual
emigration for the same period, 91,803.
</p><p>All emigration is under police control;
each emigration and steam-ship agent gives
securities for 20,000 kr&#x00F6;ne, as a guarantee for
good treatment on board ship; this deposit
has occasionally been forfeited for
misrepresentation, and from various causes, but it
forms a substantial guarantee of the good

            <pb id="p.105" n="105"/>
faith of the emigration agent, and for decency
and good treatment on board ship. Before
leaving, every emigrant has to appear before
the police, in order to prove that he has
satisfied the obligation of military service; the
police also take an account of how much
money the emigrant takes out of the country,
and it may be well here to add that the
definition of emigrant in <placeName key="Norway">Norway</placeName> is " a person who
leaves his country to better himself, and who
travels at a reduced rate, under regulations
enacted and maintained by the police."
There are no private societies, nor any
private enterprise, to promote emigration, the
feeling of the people being so strongly in its
favour. The attitude of the Government is
somewhat hostile, and on a recent occasion
the circulars of emigration agents have been
stopped in the post.</p><p>
The effort of Norwegian statesmen is
directed towards the reduction of taxation,
and thus to render emigration unnecessary.
There is a graduated taxation on bachelors
and married men; they are divided into four
classes, and assessed for taxation in inverse
proportion to the number of their families.

<pb id="p.106" n="106"/>
The Gothenburg system is now being tried
in many small towns, and it is so great a
success that it came into force in Christiana
in  <date value="1866-01">January,1866</date>.</p><p>
The sobriety thus introduced into the habits
of the Norwegians, which it is not too much to
say has been induced by wise legislation, has
seriously and favourably affected the character
and qualifications of the emigrants.</p><p>
<title>Hungary</title>
The Hungarian Government deters
emigration, by inducing migration to, and colonisation
of, State lands, on which free schools and
churches are given gratis; the payment for
land is spread over fifteen years, and immunity
from taxation granted for a similar period.
</p><p>There is little or no distress among
Hungarian peasantry, but there is considerable
ignorance; and the consequence is that they
have been misled by the statements of the
beauty of America, and the facilities offered
there for luxurious existence without the need
of work. The increase in population is very
small. <placeName key="Hungary">Hungary</placeName> is an agricultural country,
and her interest, therefore, is in free trade.
</p><p>The greater number of emigrants consists

             <pb id="p.107" n="107"/>
of indebted smaller country farmers, ruined
by bad harvests and heavy State and
communal taxes; the others are Jews, poor
labourers, and a few town people, especially
female servants. The causes of emigration
in many cases are want of work, and in some
parishes over-population.  Provisions against
emigration are laid down in law, Article 38 of
the year <date value="1881">1881</date>.  The title of this law is "Of
the Emigrational Agencies."    There is no
way of directly prohibiting the emigration of
citizens, but in the case when the emigrant
has not yet fulfilled his obligation for military
service-the Government finding that the
greater number of emigrants do not leave
their native country spontaneously, but are
induced there by agents who buy up cheaply
the little property of such emigrants, and
only try to induce the largest possible number
to emigrate, getting their commission on the
number; on account of these reasons the
legislature has devised measures against
the agencies providing:-
</p><p>"That no one is allowed to enter into contract relating
to emigration with people who want to emigrate but those
who are furnished by the Minister of the Interior with a
license for agency.

<pb id="p.108" n="108"/>
</p><p><quote rend="blockquote">"Anybody acting as agent without license can for
each act be punished with a fine not exceeding 300 florins,
and with imprisonment for a period not exceeding two
months."</quote></p><p>
Agents are not allowed to have any
business intercourse with foreign agents or
agencies without the license of the <orgName key="Minister
of the Interior.">Minister
of the Interior.</orgName></p><p>
Agents are under the control of the
authorities, and have to give notice of each case of
emigration which has been negotiated by
them.</p><p>
The contracting party can at any time
withdraw his obligation, he only being bound to
refund to the agent the out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in drawing up the contract, as well as
any sums advanced, and the eventual
travelling expenses laid out for the party.
The agent can only be furnished with a
license if he be an Hungarian subject. <orgName key="Minister
of the Interior.">Minister
of the Interior.</orgName> can refuse to grant
the license, even if the person requesting the
right of agency answers to all requirements of
the law, and he is also authorised to retract
the license at any time. The licenses expire
in one year, and must be renewed after the
expiration of that period.</p><p>

           <pb id="p.109" n="109"/>
If evidence is furnished against an agent
having committed fraud or deceit, or that he
has meditated the emigration of such persons
as have not yet fulfilled their military service,
or of persons under age without the
agreement of their parents or guardians, the whole
of the caution money of the agent becomes
at once forfeited.</p><p>

each throw some light on the emigration
question, and afford in certain particulars
examples to imitate.  While France is a
warning to deter in everything that relates
to colonization, the standard work of M.
Leroy Beaulieu, "De la colonisation chez
les peuples modernes," is an exhaustive

<pb id="p.110" n="110"/>
and philosophic treatise on the causes of
success and failure in the art of colonization.</p><p>
The practice of England herself is not
without interest. While the State concerns
itself with parental regard in seeing that the
statutory size of the emigrant's bed, as
provided in the Passengers Act, is carefully
adhered to, it ignores the depredations of
unprincipled people who, by dexterous evasion
of the law, ruin the lives and destroy the
hopes of thousands yearly. While the State
is careful to ensure comfort, and even luxury,
to the poor emigrant during his passage, she
has hitherto neglected the more important
question of advising as to his destination, and
of care as to the character of the influences
that have led him to quit this country.</p><p>
If England cares little as to why the poor
emigrant leaves the country, and is at no
pains to equip him with the latest and best
information, or to direct his courage and his
energies into the best available channels, she
is punctilious in assuring him provision of
three tons of cubic space during his passage,
and in seeing that the dietary scale provided
by law is carried out.

            <pb id="p.111" n="111"/>
</p><p><title>The Passengers Act of <date value="1855">1855</date></title> is now
obsolete and needs revision. Under the shelter of
its provisions astute and unprincipled men
practise on the credulity of the poor, and
actually convert provisions designed to
protect the duly licensed passenger broker and
his clients into the means of evading the law,
and misleading, in the light of day, hundreds
and thousands of ignorant and innocent
victims.  A few simple alterations would
secure a marked improvement. Cases have
occurred at the <orgName key="Mansion House Police Court">Mansion House Police Court</orgName>
within a recent period, where complainants

means of obtaining redress for misstatements
with reference to passages. As this law at
present stands, <orgName key="the Board of Trade ">the Board of Trade </orgName>and the
emigration officers acting under them are
powerless to assist the emigrants.
</p><p>This difficulty arises from the 4th, 66th, and
71st sections of the <title>Passengers Act of <date value="1855">1855</date></title>.
From the 4th section it will be seen that the
Act never contemplated embarkation
elsewhere than in the United Kingdom; and
from the 66th and 71st sections it will be
seen that the words " from the United Kingdom

<pb id="p.112" n="112"/>
 " raises a difficulty which cannot be got
over.</p><p>
Any future amendment of <title>the Passengers
Act</title> should follow the lines of the Netherland
law on emigration, which, in Article 7, sets
forth:-
</p><p><quote rend="blockquote">" Any person undertaking, either on his own account or
as agent, to convey Dutch or foreign emigrants from the
Netherlands, or a place out of Europe, shall,
notwithstanding whether the embarkation takes place in a Netherland
or a foreign port, previously provide real or personal bail,
as a guarantee for the fulfilment of the conditions," &amp;c.</quote></p><p>
Article 23 provides also that persons
referred to in the first part of Article 7 should
give security, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Article 22 also prohibits persons who are
qualified according to the Act from
advertising in newspapers, posting up bills, hanging
out boards, &amp;c., or taking any means
whatever for making it known that they are
emigrant agents;     and   giving  the  police
authority to deal with such cases is a wise
precaution, and would put a stop to an
immense amount of imposition being
practised on emigrants.</p><p>
Already our own colonial dependencies do

             <pb id="p.113" n="113"/>
more than half as much business with us in a
year as all the rest of the world put together.
In fourteen years the imports of British goods
by our four largest colonies have nearly
doubled, and if the same rate of progress be
maintained, in twenty-one years the internal
trade of the Empire will be worth as much as
the trade of the United Kingdom with the
rest of the world. Looking at the falling-off
in other directions, it would seem as though
the Colonies are the only quarters to which
we can look with assurance for continued
increase, and there is nothing so certain to
stimulate that trade as a new and vigorous
effort to create our own custom. In fact, the
question is no longer whether we shall do it,
but how is it to be done ? and the line of
least resistance to the desired end will
assuredly be found in a new and cordial
determination to understand the needs and to
gratify the legitimate desires of our fellow
subjects across the sea. Federation may be
formulated by the politicians, but the essence
and reality of federation must exist in the
hearts of the people, or the word is but a
tinkling cymbal and sounding brass.

framers, are measures which will increase our
trade, knit our Colonies more closely to the

dangerous classes, by reducing the supply

towns, and thus contribute to the solution of
the terrible social question which, looked at

the despair of philanthropists.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="Chapter V: Colonization" id="c5">
<head>CHAPTER V: Colonization</head><p>
The distinction between emigration and
colonization is not generally appreciated by the
public. Some of the ex-Colonial Secretaries
now living have not mastered the distinction.
Emigration is a lonely and hazardous
contrivance for the betterment of the individual,
by taking passage to another country, and
there permeating or being permeated by the
influences found on the spot. The
depopulation of <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> between the years <date value="1846">1846</date> and
<date value="1881">1881</date> was effected by emigration.
Colonization is the transfer of an organized
community from an old to a new country. The
swarming of bees offers the nearest approach

         <pb id="p.117" n="117"/>
to an exact analogy of colonization. Men of
Elizabeth's time understood the conditions,
and dared the dangers, of successful
colonization more perfectly than they are understood
in the reign of Her present Majesty.
Colonization is a complex and costly process, shrouded
with physical, administrative, and political
difficulties. It is therefore less popular than
emigration as understood by philanthropists,
where the payment of passage money begins
and ends the work to be done. Colonization
begins where emigration leaves off. The
circumstances under which a scheme of
colonization may be conducted to a
successful issue in the present era are worth
examination.</p><p>
In the first place it is well to understand
that there are but two spots on the earth's
surface available for colonization, subject to
the control of the <orgName key="English Cabinet">English Cabinet</orgName>. These
territories are <placeName key="Beccuanaland">Bechuanaland</placeName> and Western
<placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>.  The surrender of all the Crown
lands in all the other British Colonies, to the
descendants  of the first white  settlers,
necessitates negotiation with the
Governments of those white settlers before the

<pb id="p.118" n="118"/>
necessary land can be acquired otherwise than
by purchase. The Governments of the
Anglo-Saxon Colonies are elected and
maintained in power by wage-earners; and the
electorate naturally regard with abhorrence
any measures likely to reduce the rate of
wages or to lengthen the hours of work. In
South Africa, for example, the Government
of the Cape Colony has at its disposal
eighteen million acres of good and bad land,
but the conservatism of the Dutch and
Africander element of the population
extinguishes any germinal enthusiasm lurking
in the minds of the Cape Ministry for
wellconsidered schemes of colonization. The
first impediment to organized colonization,
therefore, is the fact that either the colony
must be planted by grace of the Imperial
power in one of the two Crown Colonies
situated in temperate climates, or the land
for settlement must be obtained by purchase
from private holders or the Colonial
Governments themselves.</p><p>
Assuming that the land has been obtained,
that it enjoys an adequate rainfall, is well
watered, adapted for the cultivation of garden

        <pb id="p.119" n="119"/>
stuff, as well as for the growth of cereals and
the maintenance of stock; the pioneer work
of surveying and dividing the land into
allotments, erecting temporary dwellings,
providing stores, furniture, bedding, waggons,
carts, cattle, sheep, seed, agricultural
implements, and the hundred other necessaries of
agricultural existence must be undertaken
and completed in advance of the arrival of
the main body of settlers on the land.
Rations for six months must be laid in and
issued, pending the production of food on the
spot.</p><p>
The selection of settlers, more especially in
a pioneer undertaking, is a matter of
paramount importance.   No  one  should be
included who has previously visited and
returned from the Colonies. Settlers should
be married, as otherwise the men will become
nomadic and possibly vicious in their habits;
they should not be more than thirty-five years
of age, and not encumbered with more than
two children apiece. Practical knowledge of
agricultural work, temperate habits, and good
character are essential. To ensure against
one of the commonest causes of failure the

<pb id="p.120" n="120"/>
exclusion of drink from a new settlement may
be regarded as an indispensable precaution.
There may be no desire to impose an ascetic
habit of life by insisting on abstinence, but
experience shows that the prospects of
success in a new colony are greatly increased
if the drink is resolutely and altogether
excluded.</p><p>
Agricultural labourers should form the bulk
of the pioneer parties of settlers in a new
colony. Two carpenters, blacksmiths, masons,
and handy men for every hundred settlers
may advantageously be included; but in no
case should these artizans be chosen from
large towns. The excitement of a great city
indisposes the townsman to the monotonous
toil of frontier life, while his physique is
generally wanting in the toughness necessary
to success. It cannot be urged that the
selection of an agricultural community is no
solution of one of the problems of a great
city. It is from the crowds now pouring into
the towns from country districts that choice
may be made.     Farm  labourers out of
employment are either potential townsmen
or potential settlers. Facilities offered to

       <pb id="p.121" n="121"/>
enable them to become settlers and not
townsmen, are in effect a direct solution of
one factor in the overcrowding problem,
since the diversion of the stream of labour
from where it is a source of disaster to places
where it is a source of wealth, both directly
and indirectly, is as beneficial to the great
cities as to the colonist himself, or to the
colony of which he becomes a part.</p><p>
The government and administration of
justice in a self-contained colony is a matter
requiring careful consideration. Subject to
thegeneral laws prevailing in the country in
which the settlement is placed, disputes
arising between settler and settler are better
settled on the spot than by recourse to
litigation and the arbitrament of the magistrate.
In the Mir of the Russian villages, or the
Gansabawa of Indian and Sinhalese rural
communities, we have types of a Village
Council suitable to a simple, but orderly
system of society.  The election of three
village elders by the settlers themselves for
every hundred members of the community,
whose decisions shall be binding in all such
matters remitted to them as do not conflict

<pb id="p.122" n="122"/>
with the jurisdiction of the general law, will
be found in practice to be an effectual
method of maintaining the peace of the
community. The Village Council so chosen
will also be fitted to deal with all matters
of communal interest, such as commonage
rights : the sequence in the use of agricultural
implements or machinery common to the
settlement: education: and other matters
relating to the welfare of the commonwealth.
The meetings of the Council should take
place weekly. For this purpose a
meetingplace should be provided, which will also
serve as church-house, schoolroom, and
general place of assembly. Elections to the
Village Council should take place yearly.</p><p>
Failures in schemes of colonization are not
infrequently the result of ignorance of local
conditions, usages, and customs.
Administration from London of the details of a new
settlement over the sea is a hopeless task,
and one which, if attempted, is predestined
to failure. Essential, therefore, and a primary
condition of success, is the presence on the
spot of an old colonist or colonists who will
undertake the responsible task of organizing

         <pb id="p.123" n="123"/>
all the details for the selection of land, survey
of the allotments, and preparation for the
reception of emigrants. It is better to have
a Committee of old colonists than to depend
on the judgment of an individual, as the
wisdom of numbers is apparent in counsel.
The real labours of the organization of a
successful colony devolve on this Committee,
and where their labours are followed by
success, the honours which are too often
lavished by England on participation in the
operations of war, or of State ceremonial,
may well be conferred on those who have
organized victory from the stubborn elements
with which they have to deal.</p><p>
The relations of the settlers to the
Committee should be laid down with exactness before
leaving England. The following agreement is
the production of experienced colonists, and
is actually employed in one such settlement
as that described in this chapter.</p><p><title>
Conditions of Emigration under
Colonization Scheme.</title></p><p>
I. Each family will have from 20 to 50
acres for agricultural purposes and homestead,

<pb id="p.124" n="124"/>
 as well as the use of a certain amount
of land for communal grazing.</p><p>
II. Each occupant will have absolute
possession of his section of land, and will be
entitled to graze on the common-land, ten
head of cattle and ten sheep, each head of
cattle to represent four sheep; thus, should
he prefer to keep sheep only, he would have
the right to graze fifty.</p><p>
III. Each  family will be provided on
arrival with temporary house accommodation,
consisting of two good-sized huts, and
necessary household furniture will be provided.</p><p>
IV. Each section will be accurately
surveyed, for the prevention of disputes as to
boundaries, etc.</p><p>
V. Sufficient cattle, ploughs, seed,
waggons, or Scotch carts, &amp;c., will, at the
discretion of the Local Committee, be
supplied to enable the emigrants to get a fair
start in working the land, but two or more
families will have to participate jointly in the
use of the same when required by the
Committee.</p><p>
VI. Provisions will be served out to each
family for the first six months if required.
</p><p>
         <pb id="p.125" n="125"/>
VII. No charge will be made for the first
year either for passage-money, rent, interest,
rates, or taxes; from which date forward a
rental will be charged of &#x00A3;10 per annum,
exclusive of rates and taxes, per family,
payable half-yearly, to cover interest and
wear and tear. Should it be necessary to
make any advance in individual cases, the
Committee at its discretion will do so,
charging interest for such at the rate of five
per cent. per annum.</p><p>
VIII. The cost of each allotment of land,
with grazing rights as hereinbefore mentioned,
together with the expenses of locating each
emigrant family, is estimated to average
about &#x00A3;200 sterling.</p><p>
IX. The holding and stock to become the
property of the tenant on payment of the
amount of such cost and expenses, and any
payments made on account shall bear five
per cent. interest. Should any tenant desire
to dispose of his land and stock, the consent
of the Committee thereto must be first
obtained and purchaser approved. The
Committee, however, in all cases to have the first
option of purchase, the tenant being entitled

sum due to the Committee.</p><p>
X. Any emigrant convicted of any serious
crime, or who fails faithfully to fulfil his
obligations under these conditions, or is found
drunk and disorderly, will be liable to be
ejected from his holding summarily by the
Committee, who will at once, and without
process of law, resume possession of all
property delivered to such emigrant.</p><p>
XI. In case of such ejectment, the
Committee will give the emigrant credit for the
value of any improvements made by him on
his holding and for any sums of money
received from him; and should the total
amount of the same exceed the amount in
which such emigrant is indebted on account
of the expenses aforesaid, including any
special advance which may have been made
to him by the Committee, the balance in
favour of the emigrant shall be paid to him by
the Committee.</p><p>
XII. Facilities for educational purposes
will be provided, information regarding which
will be detailed in due course.</p><p>
XIII. Emigrants will embark in London,

          <pb id="p.127" n="127"/>
and disembark at ---, in the Colony
of ---.    They will then proceed to their
destination in -- .</p><p>
I, the undersigned, ---, do hereby
agree to the aforegoing conditions of
emigration, and I do further covenant and promise
faithfully to perform all the obligations by
the said conditions imposed upon me.
Given under my hand at --, this --
day of --, 188-.</p><p>
The first principle guiding the
administration of a new settlement must be
nonshrinkage of capital. If capital is lost, alms
have been bestowed which might as well
have been thrown in the sea.  Repayment
by the settlers of their advances is only
possible when the settlers themselves are
capable and efficient. Efficiency, therefore,
must be rigidly prescribed in the choice of
settlers, and a resolute maintenance of the
highest standard is the truest kindness both
to those who leave the mother country and
to those who remain behind.</p><p>
Ambitious projects involving the
expenditure of hundreds of thousands, and even of
millions of money, are from time to time submitted

<pb id="p.128" n="128"/>
 to the consideration of the Colonial
Office. Paper security is all that can be
offered as a pledge of the return of the
capital advanced, and consequently no
ambitious scheme on a large scale has yet
received the support of a responsible Minister.
From study and experience I am of opinion
that success is more likely to attend the
organization of small colonizing schemes than
those of more ambitious proportions. For the
sum of ten thousand pounds from three to four
hundred souls can be planted out with every
reasonable prospect of a return of the capital
invested. Much tact, industry, and skill are
required in the organization of a new
settlement; but in no department of enterprise is
the result of success so rich and so permanent
as in the establishment of a new colony.
Exactly three hundred years have elapsed
since the enterprising navigators of Elizabeth's
reign planted the first English Colony in
Virginia. Gilbert and Raleigh contended
with difficulties to which this generation is a
stranger. To-day the task is easier, but no
less fraught with the destinies of a great
nation. Gilberts and Raleighs are still to be

          <pb id="p.129" n="129"/>
found capable and wise enough to conduct to
a successful issue colonizing schemes
appropriate to our changed conditions of life.
Ecclesiastical tyranny no longer drives into
the wilderness legions of Huguenots or of
Puritans. But the pressure of want ever
tightening its grip over masses of the
population supplies all the centrifugal force formerly
generated by the cruelty of priests and the
persecutions of bigot kings.</p><p>
Colonization in the nineteeth century has
been suspended. It is the one problem which
requires money to set it in action and to
conduct the process of settlement to a final issue.
Much of the money expended in emotional
charities, and in the maintenance of paid
secretaries, might as well be poured into the sea
for all the permanent good effected by the
expenditure. Divert the stream of pauper-raising
charities to supporting a system of colonization,
and the public will have, at all events, some
assurance of permanently (and without the
waste or extinction of capital) converting idle
labourers into producers of wealth for
themselves and for those left at home, with whom
rivalry for a crust will have ceased for ever.

<div1 type="chapter" n="Chapter VI: Overcrowding" id="c6"><head>CHAPTER VI: Overcrowding</head><p>
THE magnetism of large cities is characterised
as much by the intensity as by the volume of
evil generated within the field of influence.
The effects on the health and character of the
working classes, resulting from overcrowding,
are numerous; it is a plague-spot of furious
vitality: so prolific of disease to body and mind,
that the stream of philanthropy has exhausted
effort in wetting a sore when it should cleanse
a cancer, and in dealing with effects when
fully developed, instead of drowning them in
the centre at their birth. Overcrowding is a
central evilround which the others are grouped.
The unit of the problem of overcrowding is
the one-room system. The result of the one-room

   <pb id="p.131" n="131"/>
 system is the one-bed system, and the
effect of the one-bed system is somewhat to
mitigate the advantages of the system of
national education, on the subject of which
the English people are so cock-a-whoop. The
single-room system forges incest, illegitimacy,
juvenile prostitution, drunkenness, dirt,
idleness, disease, and a death-rate higher than
that of <placeName key="Grosvenor Square">Grosvenor Square</placeName>.  The rate of
mortality in a certain quarter of <placeName key="St. Pancras">St. Pancras</placeName>
was stated by <persName key="Murphy, Dr.">Dr. Murphy</persName> to have reached in
<date value="1882">1882</date> the enormous rate of 70'1 per thousand.
The average death-rate for England is 19'6
per thousand. Much suffering is caused to
little children in overcrowded districts, which
does not appear in the death-rate. Their
happiness is impaired and their health injured
by breathing air tainted by disease. In St.
Luke's, ophthalmia, locally known as the blight,
is prevalent. Scrofula and congenital diseases
are also prevalent among the young children.
Typhus is intimately connected with
overcrowding; but infectious and even fatal
disease is not so great an evil as the general
reduction of stamina all round resulting from
the generic poison of overcrowded centres.

(<date value="1885">1885</date>), the evils of overcrowding are a

certain localities, " more serious than they ever

designed to meet these evils, but the atrocious
want of system, the character of some of those

Despite the wisdom and expert knowledge
of which this clotted mass of legislation is the
monument, the evils attacked by the
Governments of the last thirty years " have not only
continued, but have in some places increased
in the most aggravated manner " (Report of
Royal Commission). The will of Parliament
has been exerted perfunctorily. <placeName key="Sussex">Sussex</placeName> and

never been articulate, and thus evils which
would frenzy the nation were they to happen
in <placeName key="Fort Qu'appelle">Fort Qu'appelle</placeName> or Cawnpore are accepted
with languid remorse by the country at large.
Gross neglect and corruption by members
of the local Vestries and Boards of Guardians
contribute largely to the state of affairs in

<pb id="p.134" n="134"/>
East London. The work, for example, of
house drainage is imperfectly done-largely in
consequence of there being little supervision
on  the part of the local authorities.       Bad
sanitary arrangements usual in the poor man's
house are incredible to the comfortable
classes. Ashpits and dustbins are few and far
between.    Refuse vegetable matter is thrown
into open dustholes, and poisons in the process
of decomposition the air of close courts. The
neglect by the local authority of dustbins is
the means of communicating scarlet fever to
whole rows of houses.     In the metropolis the
law provides:-
</p><p><quote rend="blockquote">" First, that the vestry or district board, as the case may
be, must-(a) appoint and employ persons; or (b)
contract with some company or persons for collecting and
removing all dirt, ashes, rubbish, and filth in houses and
places within their parish or district. The scavengers so
employed or contracted with, or their servants, are to
perform their duties on such days, and at such hours, and
in such manner as the vestry or district board from time
to time appoint. The penalty for neglect of duty on the
part of the scavenger is a sum not exceeding &#x00A3;5 for
every offence (18 and 19 Vict., c. 120, S. 125). An
occupier or person who refuses or does not permit any soil,
dirt, ashes, or filth to be taken away by the scavengers, or
who obstructs the scavengers in the performance of their

                <pb id="p.135" n="135"/>
duty, is liable for every offence to a penalty not exceeding
&#x00A3;5 (18 and 19 Vict., c. 120, S. 126).</quote>
</p><p><quote rend="blockquote">"Second, as to urban sanitary districts, i.e., boroughs,
Local Government    districts, and  Improvement Act
districts-Every urban sanitary authority may, and when
required by order of the Local Government Board, must,
undertake or contract for-(a) the removal of house refuse
from premises; (b) the cleansing of ashpits, either for the
whole or any part of the district. If any person removes,
or obstructs the authority or contractor in removing, any
of the matters above mentioned which are authorized to
be removed by the authority, he is liable for the offence to
a penalty not exceeding &#x00A3;5 (38 and 39 Vict., c. 55, s.</quote></p><p>
<quote rend="blockquote">42). If the authority, who have themselves undertaken
or contracted  for the removal of house refuse from
premises, or the cleansing of ashpits, fail, without reasonable
excuse, after notice in writing, from the occupier of any
house within their district, requiring them to remove any
house refuse, or to cleanse any ashpit belonging to the
house, or used by the occupiers of it, to cause the same to
be removed or cleansed, as the case may be, within seven
days, the authority will be liable to pay to the occupier of
the house a penalty not exceeding 5s. for every day during
which the default continues after the expiration of the
period of seven days (38 and 39 Vict., c. 55, s. 43).
But where the sanitary authority do not themselves
undertake or contract for-(a) the removal of house refuse;
(b) the cleansing of ashpits belonging to any premises;
they may make bye-laws imposing the duty of cleansing or
removal, at such intervals as they think fit, upon the
occupier of the premises.</quote></p><p>

<pb id="p.136" n="136"/>
</p><p><quote rend="blockquote">" The sanitary authority may also make bye-laws for the
prevention of nuisances arising from filth, dust, ashes, and
rubbish (38 and 39 Vict., c. 55, s. 44). The authority

receptacles for the temporary deposit and collection of dust,
ashes, and rubbish; and they may also provide fit
buildings and places for the deposit of the matters collected by
them (38 and 39 Vict., c. 55, s. 45).</quote>
</p><p><quote rend="blockquote">" Although this is not the place for the consideration of
matters connected with rural sanitary districts, it may be
mentioned that the provisions in force are the same as in
urban sanitary districts, except those set out in the last
paragraph above."-(<title>Report of the Royal Commission on
the Housing of the Working Classes</title>, p. 9.)</quote>
</p><p>The water supply in the poorer portions of
London is inadequate, and the source of
misery, and unhealthiness and misery.
Personal cleanliness, the mark of a gentle
mind, is impossible where the supply of water
is uncertain, and where, from the absence of
storage accommodation, it has to be kept in
tubs, and often in the foul atmosphere of
sleeping-rooms.     Even when there is a supply in
the houses, they are often supplied from one
and the same cistern, for the purpose of
flushing the sanitary arrangements and quenching
the thirst.   The cistern   is often uncovered,
and close to the closet pan and the dust heap.

        <pb id="p.137" n="137"/>
Much power is confided to the local
authorities in regard to the provision of
closet accommodation. In Clerkenwell, cases
occur of one closet for sixteen houses.
Indigent Italians engaged in the ice-cream and
barrel-organ trade have peculiarly offensive
habits. Remissness of the local authorities,
and the nebulous state of the law on the
question as to the difference between a servant
and a lodger, combine to produce a
condition of things which had better be left to the
imagination.</p><p>
Offensive trades carried on in insanitary
dwellings give rise to peculiarly energetic,
capable, and efficient germs of disease. Rags
saturated with filth, picked in unventilated
rooms, are the vehicles of virulent fevers and
contagious disorders. Some trades, such as
matchbox making, requiring the use of paste,
especially in warm weather, are especially
disgusting. Rabbit-pulling is, perhaps, the
most pernicious, as the air is charged with
fluff; and when a stray sunbeam shoots
athwart the murky room, the atmosphere
appears solid enough to be sliced with a
bread-knife. Fish are cured and smoked in

<pb id="p.138" n="138"/>
bedrooms inhabited by human beings, and
the costermonger restores his haddocks,
watercresses, and fruit-which have been
deposited beneath his bed for the night-by
anointing them with the water which has
been described by <persName key="Farrar, Canon">Canon Farrar</persName> as "the
pure diamond of God."</p><p>
The absence of a general system of
mortuaries involves the retention in the
living-room of the family of a corpse until
the funeral takes place.  In the interval
between the death and interment the
ordinary habits of life are maintained. Eating,
drinking, and sleeping in the company of the
dead is gruesome to the mind; and when
the body remains unburied for a lengthened
period-as is usual among the poor--the
health of the living is endangered, if not
impaired.</p><p>
As mortuaries are rare, and, under the
present form of local government, are
unlikely to increase, the only remedy for this
evil is the enactment of a measure
providing for the burial of corpses within
fortyeight hours of death. The customary delay
which is allowed to elapse in England between

          <pb id="p.139" n="139"/>
death and burial, especially among the poorer
classes, has no parallel in other civilized
countries.  The custom is attended by no
advantage, and it is difficult to discover any
reasons why this period should not at all
events be materially curtailed.</p><p>
Overcrowding is partly due to the
structural defects of houses built for other purposes,
but inhabited from cellar to garret by the
poorest folk. Houses built for the well-to-do
merchant of George the Second's time have
passed through many vicissitudes before
arriving at the tenement period of their
existence, when they become the object of
well-meaning, but ineffectual legislation.
Nominal owners have parted with effectual
control, and the inevitable consequence is
the disregard of all the intermediate
profitmongers for the condition in which tenement
property is kept. No radical improvement
in the housing of the poor can take place
until the  principle is accepted by the
Legislature that no original owner can by
sub-letting alienate responsibility where he
continues to receive profit. The necessary
misery of many as essential to the profit of

<pb id="p.140" n="140"/>
one is conformable neither to the Sermon on
the Mount nor to the enactments of just
law. Nothing short of the expropriation of
defaulting owners and the suppression of the
present form of local government will meet
the difficulty; and, in any case, the
indignanation of the public at the perpetuation of
remediable evils for the sake of gain, when
men's lives are the counters, must be aroused
against the evil-doers.</p><p>
Among the well-to-do an eighth to a tenth
of the income is spent in rent. Among the
poor, according to <persName key="Marchant, Mr. Williams">Mr. Marchant Williams</persName>,
<orgName key="Inspector of Schools for the London School
Board">Inspector of Schools for the London School
Board</orgName>, eighty-eight per cent. of the dwellers
in certain poor quarters of London spend
more than one-fifth of their income in rent;
forty-six per cent. pay from one-fourth to
one-half; forty-two per cent. pay from
onefourth to one-fifth; and only twelve per cent.
pay less than one-fifth of their weekly wages
in rent. Four shillings is the average rent
of one room, and six shillings of two. The
disproportion between rent and wages is
increasing in intensity in certain parts of
London. Congestion proceeds apace, while

         <pb id="p.141" n="141"/>
wages are not rising; casual labourers and
many of the poorer artizans are compelled to
live near their work. Workmen's trains are
luxuries for a higher rank in society. Dock
labourers must be in readiness for a " call,"
which may arise at any moment. White men
in the heart of London are fighting any
winter morning, like Esquimaux dogs over a
piece of blubber, for the work that only a few
can get.  Even skilled artizans, such as
Clerkenwell watchmakers, not owning all the
expensive tools required by their delicate
trade, must borrow once or twice a day, and
must return the apparatus with punctuality.
This prevents their living at a distance from
their work.  Girls engaged in the artificial
flower trade must be in attendance whether
there be work for them or not; for, like the
Dock hands, if they be not within hail,
they lose the chance of casual
employment.</p><p>
The pressure caused by the immigration of
foreign Jews, especially into <placeName key="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</placeName>,
<placeName key="Spitalfields">Spitalfields</placeName>, and <placeName key="St. George's-in-the-East">St. George's-in-the-East</placeName>, is
another cause of overcrowding.  So serious
is this question of the immigration of the

<pb id="p.142" n="142"/>
indigent foreigner, that some consideration
of the subject may not be out of place.</p><p>
In the <placeName key="United States">United States</placeName>, British Columbia, and
in <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>, the indigent foreigner of the
Mongolian variety has received the earnest
attention of the Legislatures concerned. While
it is not urged that the Chinaman and the
indigent German Jew are in all respects similar,
there is sufficient identity in the two problems
to render an examination into the merits of
the <title>Chinese Exclusion Acts</title> interesting and
important.</p><p>
The case for the exclusion of Chinese from
the English Colonies is as follows:-</p><p>
1. That they arrive in the country faster
than any other kind of immigrant.</p><p>
2. That they are superior in number to our
own race.</p><p>
3. That they are not disposed to be
governed by our laws.</p><p>
4. That they are dissimilar in habits and
occupation to our own people.</p><p>
5. That they evade the payment of taxes
justly due to the Government.</p><p>
6. That they are governed by pestilential
habits.</p><p>

        <pb id="p.143" n="143"/>
7. That they are useless in cases of
emergency.</p><p>
8. That they habitually desecrate
graveyards by the removal of bodies therefrom.</p><p>
9. That the laws governing the whites are
found to be inapplicable to Chinese.</p><p>
10. That they are inclined to habits
subversive of the comfort and well-being of the
community.</p><p>
Certain of the charges in this indictment
are unjust if sought to be applied to the
indigent foreigner, who contributes so largely
to the overcrowding problem of our great
cities. Some of the counts are only too true;
and so bitterly is the justice of these charges
felt by those suffering from the immigration,
it would not be surprising to witness a
j&#x00FC;denhetze in the heart of London. Temperate in
his habits, and with a low standard of
comfort, the poor foreigner evades all taxation in
England, while he presses heavily on the
poorer English in the struggle for existence.
While the <placeName key="United States">United States</placeName>, with all her boasted
freedom, relentlessly rejects and returns on our
hands all indigent English or Irish emigrants
who knock at the door of the Immigrant Dep&#x00F4;t

<pb id="p.144" n="144"/>
at <placeName key="Castle Garden-England">Castle Garden-England</placeName>, the home of cant
as well as of the free, admits, without a
protest, all the poor souls driven from Silesian
soil by the imperious necessities of
Bismarckian policy. <orgName key="Red Church">the Red Church</orgName> is a great country,
and <placeName key="Bismarck">Bismarck</placeName> is an eminent man; but why
England should remain content to act as
rubbish-heap to the great country and the
eminent man, when neither America nor our
own Colonies will take a single pauper from
us, passes all understanding. This
remonstrance is no political indictment, and appeals
to neither party nor passion. England will
cease to be England if our rulers do not show
that they love the English more than the
frugal, unlovable foreigner. Cant and
hypocrisy may talk of freedom and England being
a sanctuary for the desolate and oppressed.
Freedom to starve and to go to the streets
for Englishmen and English girls, is to be set
against the vicarious hospitality quidnuncs
would continue to extend to indigent foreigners,
and thus constrain their unwilling companions
and rivals of English blood, by the riotous
excesses of political economy, to seek a
sanctuary in starvation, and repose in death. So

         <pb id="p.145" n="145"/>
long as the evil was restricted, the hospitality
and the freedom of England were topics well
calculated to regale the national appetite for
sentiment and ideas. Now that the evil is
growing apace, and becomes apparent even to
those who are not crowded out of existence by
the competition of untaxed strangers within
our gates, the question arises as to what is
the best method of grappling with the
difficulty.</p><p>
Public opinion in England is not sufficiently
robust to reject, at the port of disembarkation,
paupers of foreign blood; and, owing to local
circumstances, any inquiry instituted on
landing into the means of the immigrant would
easily be baffled or evaded. The only remedy
apparent to me is the imposition of a poll-tax,
which should not be less in amount than eight
pounds.  It could be made recoverable from
employers in the same manner as income tax is
collected from public companies on behalf of
their employes. If it be objected that <orgName key="Red Church">the Red Church</orgName>
and other States will retaliate by the
imposition of similar taxation, the obvious reply is
that settlement in our own Colonies will
receive a stimulus, ar  national development

<pb id="p.146" n="146"/>
will thus be concentrated within the
circumference of the empire.</p><p>
The magnetic attraction exerted by the
mass of a great city on the impressionable
minds of agricultural labourers who are driven
from the soil is in itself one overwhelming
cause of the overcrowding problem.
Nevertheless, artificial encouragement is given to
the increase of population by the
advertisements of contractors for provincial labour
when labour in excess is present on the spot.
The extension of the <orgName key="Metropolitan and
District Railways ">Metropolitan and
District Railways </orgName>was carried out by bringing up
people from the provinces when men in plenty
were obtainable on the spot. Contractors do
not regard city labourers with favour. Industry
and sobriety are found more usually in the
rural than in the urban population. <persName key="Billing, Rev. R.C.">The Rev.
R. C. Billing</persName>, a clergyman with great
knowledge of the subject, considers that, if it
could be done, some attempt should be made
to counteract those proceedings of advertising
to bring labour to an over-stocked market.
It is probable that any such attempt, to be
practicable, must take the form of improving
the moral and physical status of the poorer

       <pb id="p.147" n="147"/>
inhabitants of a great city, rather than that
of legislative interference with the execution
of contract works.</p><p>
Immigration with all its evils, and from
whatever cause, is not so serious a factor in
the overcrowding problem as demolitions and
the consequent displacement of population.
Demolitions may be divided into five classes.</p><p>
1. Clearances undertaken by owners for
the improvement of their property when no
provision is made for the poor tenants.</p><p>

</p><p>The first of these classes presents, in an
extreme form, the logical issue of the rights
of property; one where an intellectual assent
to the exercise of such rights is demanded

<pb id="p.148" n="148"/>
from people who are incapable of according
their assent.  As a wild blackbird cannot
resist black currants growing in a garden, so
men, evicted for another's gain, with no covert
in which to lay their head, cannot resist the
conclusion that the laws of life are superior
to the laws of property; and that political
economy is subordinate to the higher laws of
humanity and justice. Those whose need is
greatest suffer most acutely.</p><p>
The second class of demolition is
undertaken from humane motives, but is the cause
of hardship from the manner in which the
arrangements are carried out.  Rents are
raised in adjacent districts, and it happens
sometimes that the poor are turned out of
fairly well-ordered rooms, and are compelled
to make their new abode in quarters several
degrees lower in quality, and not lower in
rental.</p><p>
Next come the street improvements.
Perhaps this is the worst of all the classes,
for the poor, often ejected only by the sound of
the pick and crowbar at their very threshold,
overcrowd the surrounding neighbourhood,
send up rents, and often " sink into a miserable

        <pb id="p.149" n="149"/>
mode of life, after being accustomed
to decency and cleanliness."</p><p>
Sites for the erection of School Boards are
necessarily chosen in the most crowded parts
of the town, and consequently occasion
distress similar in character to that arising from
public improvements.</p><p>
The inability of the poor to protect
themselves is rarely more conspicuous than when
receiving notices to remove from their
dwellings by the agents of a <orgName key="Railway Company">Railway Company</orgName>.
They do not appreciate the fact until the roof
is about their ears. As in <placeName key="Calcutta,">Calcutta,</placeName> the

At the present time <orgName key="Inspectors of Nuisances">Inspectors of Nuisances</orgName>

to the overcrowding proglem. In <placeName key="Islington">Islington</placeName>

according to the Report of the Royal Commission
-were "thirteen or fourteen persons

property." Sanitary Inspectors whose office
and pay are subject to the pleasure of such
a body may be expected to be supine.
<placeName key="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</placeName> basks in the sunshine of notoriety
both from the state of the homes of the working

As an example fo the class of appointment
made by the local authorities of some portions
of London, the evidence of <persName key="Paget, Mr. Robert">Mr. Robert Paget</persName>,
<orgName key="Clerk to the Vestry of Clerkenwell">Clerk to the Vestry of Clerkenwell</orgName>, reveals
some singular practices. It appears from this gentleman's.

<pb id="p.151" n="151"/>

evidence before the Royal Commission
(Q. 17,679) that one of the sanitary inspectors
of the parish acts also as secton, coronor's
officer, messenger to the vestry, and that the
training enjoyed by this versatile functionary
to fit him for the charge of the lives and
health of thousands of human beings was that
"he was something in the Jewelley Trade"
It is clear from such an instance as this that,
pending changes in the government
of London, the Local Government Board
should be entrusted with a veto on the appointment
of parochial sanitary officials.
</p><p>The truth must be told, and it cannot be refuted. Vestrymen,
voracious, incapable, devoid of public spirit, swarm like locusts on
a field of young millet, fatten on the rate payers,
taint the record of public life, check
the resolves of human officials, and betray
the interests they are elected to protect.
Saturated with corruption, and incompetent,
the present form of Local Government in London is doomed. Counterfeit representation
leads to illusory forms of protecting the poor and needy-forms which are but phantoms
flitting to and fro, powerless to right


<pb id="p.152" n="152"/>
great wrongs, or to carry out the permanent,
solid, and straightforward purposes of an
honest and hearty desire to attenuate evil and
advance the good.</p><p>
Forty-five acres of land are available in
London on the removal of the prisons for the
erection of artizans' dwellings.</p><p>
The Public Prosecutor should, as the only
functionary competent to do so, proceed
against owners or holders of insanitary
property on behalf of those who have suffered
injury or loss to property or health.  To
invest an impoverished apple-woman with the
power of bringing a civil action against the
<persName key="Westminster, Duke of">Duke of Westminster</persName> or his middlemen and
sub-lessees is one of those legislative quips
of which the <title>Adulteration Act</title> presents
another conspicuous example.</p><p>
The recommendations of the main body of
the Royal Commissioners partake of a
temporising character. It is necessary to
clear away root and branch the present
vestry system. No legislation designed to
impress on the local authority a sense of
their duty in relation to the vigorous
enforcement of sanitary laws can be efficacious when

         <pb id="p.153" n="153"/>
no sense of duty finds a place in the
consciences and the hearts of many of those who
are typical representatives of the present
system.  A Municipality for London
conceived on Imperial lines, with a system of
representation sufficiently wide in scope to
evoke the patriotic services of worthy citizens,
is of the first necessity if measures are
seriously undertaken with the object of
bettering the condition of the poor. Water supply,
sanitary accommodation, responsibility of
owners, abatement of nuisances, are details
of great moment, but subordinate in
importance to the greater question of providing
administrative machinery adequate to grapple
with the tremendous problem with which it
has to deal, and manned by men enjoying the
confidence of the public.</p>

</div1><div1 type="chapter" n="Chapter VII: Adulteration" id="c7">
<head>CHAPTER VII: Adulteration</head><p>Mahomet, at the Farewell pilgrimage,
enjoined his followers in these words:-
</p><p>" And your slaves ! see that ye feed them with such
food as ye eat yourselves, and clothe them with the same
stuff ye wear. And if they commit a fault which ye
incline not to forgive, then sell them; for they are the
servants of the Lord, and are not to be tormented."
The white serfs of capital are tormented
with many evils. Not the least of these evils
is the tainted food and drink supplied to them
under the present system. Mr. Bright is in
a measure responsible for the palsy that has
stayed the hand of the law and shaken the
opinion of the public in regard to the matter

             <pb id="p.155" n="155"/>
of adulteration.  It is a "form of
competition," says the right honourable Gentleman.
That little phrase has had wide and
farreaching effects in composing the consciences
of venal traders. "It is a form of
competition," whispers the grocer to himself, as he
sands his sugar or waters his vinegar. Food
and drink are persistently debased by spurious
ingredients; quality is counterfeited, bulk
increased, appearance improved, and
constituents abstracted with impunity. Legislation
does not lag. It is not enforced. <title>The Act
of <date value="1872">1872</date></title> is an excellent measure-for well-todo
 people. The proof of its excellence is
shown by the quality of the tea and sugar
well-to-do people are able to buy. When the
poor man buys his two-pennyworth of " coffee,"
half-ripe, insect-eaten  and  sea-damaged,
blended with chicory which has been treated
to an admixture of beans, acorn flour, lupin
seed, " Hambro' powder," mangold wurtzel,
and spent tan, the law says to him-" If you
have reason to believe your purchase is
adulterated, you can set in motion the machinery
of the <title>Sale of Foods Ac</title>t by placing a deposit
varying from half-a-crown to half-a-guinea in

<pb id="p.156" n="156"/>
the hands of the local authority.  If, on
analysis, your suspicions are confirmed by the
scientific gentlemen with competent medical,
chemical, and microscopical knowledge, your
deposit shall be returned to you." The poor
man, however, does not happen to have a spare
half-guinea available for scientific research,
and he is unacquainted with the existence of
the beneficent legislation which has been
enacted for his behoof. As a natural
consequence, the <title>Adulteration Act of <date value="1875">1875</date></title> is
essentially a piece of class legislation. It is
adapted to protect the rich man and his family.
To the care of the venal and voracious
vestrymen is left the protection of the tribe of poor.
Tea in <placeName key="East End">the East End</placeName> is remarkable for
characteristics acquired after being despatched
from <placeName key="Canton">Canton</placeName> or <placeName key="Calcutta">Calcutta</placeName>. Floor dust and
sweepings are the principal ingredients.
</p><p>Bread is adulterated with rice. In practice
100 lbs. of flour will make from 133 lbs. to
137 lbs. of bread; so that a sack of 280 lbs.
of flour should yield 95 four-pound loaves.
The baker's skill is shown by contriving to
increase the number. This he effects by the
addition of a gummy mess of boiled rice,

         <pb id="p.157" n="157"/>
which enables him to increase his out-turn by
five per cent. Such bread generates obscure
fungoids with rapidity, and on a warm day
turns sour in twelve hours.</p><p>
The test for good flour is its sweetness and
freedom from acidity and musty flavour.
Good flour, when kneaded, yields a tough,
elastic gluten, which, when baked in an oven,
expands and appears of a rich brown colour.
Bad flour makes a ropy-looking gluten,
difficult of manipulation, and is of a dirty brown
colour when baked. Oils are adulterated with
inferior kinds, and the fraud is detected by
means of the specific gravity of the oils.
</p><p>Isinglass is adulterated with gelatine, the
fraud being so contrived as to retain, to some
extent, the well-known character of genuine
isinglass. The true isinglass may be
recognised from the false in the following way:
immersed in cold water the shreds of genuine
isinglass become white and opaque like cotton
threads, and they swell equally in all
directions, whereas those of gelatine become
transparent and ribbon-like.</p><p>
Mustard is so powerful in flavour it is
commonly diluted with flour, turmeric being added

<pb id="p.158" n="158"/>
to improve the appearance. Genuine mustard
does not contain starch, and does not become
blue when treated with a solution of iodine.
</p><p>The bees of English cottagers flit from
flower to flower without result, for the
adulteration of honey is so universal that there is
little or no demand for the genuine English
article.</p><p>
Pepper, cinnamon, curry-powder, ginger,
and cayenne are also the subjects of
fraudulent adulteration. Linseed meal and powdered
capsicums are used for adulterating pepper.
Ginger powder is sophisticated with sago,
meal rice, and turmeric, while the colouring
agents of curry-powder and cayenne are earth,
brick-dust, red lead, and vermilion. Spices
are sometimes deprived of their active
properties before they are ground and sold to the
poor.</p><p>
Beer is adulterated, especially on
Saturdays in the small beershops, to give fictitious
strength, to improve the body and flavour,
and to impart a bitterness. For these
purposes tobacco, opium, indicus cocculus,
capsicums, ground ginger, liquorice, treacle, salt,
quassia, gentian, and horehound are employed

          <pb id="p.159" n="159"/>
as adulterants. The brutal violence so often
committed after an orgie on beer only is
probably caused by the maddening influences
of some of these ingredients. It is needless
to describe the adulterants employed in
degrading the qualities of wines at Hamburg
and elsewhere, as wine is not consumed in the
<placeName key="East End">East End</placeName>-except on high days and holidays,
when some bacchanalian may call for a " pot
of port " to treat his boon companions.
</p><p>The adulteration of spirits consists mostly
in the use of raw and inferior spirit. The
newness of spirit is a great evil. East-Enders
have acquired a taste for fusel oil. Ripe old
whisky, ten years old, drunk in equal
quantities, would probably impart a tone of sobriety
to the densely-populated quarters of which
we are speaking.</p><p>
Butter is probably seldom sold to the very
poor. One shilling a pound is the price of the
grease sold to them as butter. Fat and mud
appear to be the constituents employed in this
department of dairy industry. Milk is
adulterated with the adulterated water sold by the
water companies. The same "form of
competition " enters into the preparation of sugar,

<pb id="p.160" n="160"/>
which contains insoluble ingredients-flour,
oatmeal, and arrowroot.</p><p>
Meat is adulterated, under the meaning of
the Act, by selling as English that which is
really of American or Australasian origin.
Twenty-five million pounds of frozen mutton
are annually imported into England. Most
of this meat is fraudulently sold as English
mutton. Until a master butcher is tied down
over an ants' nest, or otherwise visited with
the displeasure of society, the practice of
falsifying the character of meat is likely to
continue.  What is known as "croaker"
meat (Scottish braxie)-flesh from an animal
dying a natural death-is disposed of by
costermongers.  <orgName key="Inspectors of Nuisances">Inspectors of Nuisances</orgName>
now and then prosecute the salesmen of this
bad meat, and sometimes a conviction ensues.
Pickles are in much favour in <placeName key="East End">the East End</placeName>,
and from the admixture of copper do not
escape the universal contamination. Relishes
such as bright green pickles are used to
season the digestion of offal purchased of
" cag-mag " butchers. Savouries are much
liked.</p><p>
Adulteration in other countries is strictly

         <pb id="p.161" n="161"/>
prohibited under penal obligations.  The
Prussian penal code provides that any person
selling adulterated or spoiled goods shall be
fined, or, as an alternative, imprisoned for six
weeks, with confiscation of goods; and it is
not necessary to prove that the seller was
aware of the adulteration. In <placeName key="Holland">Holland</placeName>, and
in <placeName key="France ">France </placeName>by the Code Napoleon, a sentence
of imprisonment varying from six days to
two years may be inflicted.</p><p>
The manner in which the materials for food
and drink are adulterated in England is
exemplified by a little story. There were three
flies who were great friends.  These flies
started on a journey in search of something
to eat. They came to a piece of bread; one
of the flies being very hungry stepped in
advance of his companions and fastened
eagerly on to the bread; it contained alum,
and the fly died in great agony from the
contraction of his digestive apparatus. His
remaining companions, oppressed with grief,
mourned his loss, but hunger compelled them
to seek subsistence.  They arrived at a bowl
of sugar, of which one partook; the sugar
contained sulphuric acid, and one more unhappy

<pb id="p.162" n="162"/>
 insect laid down his life. The survivor,
bereft of his companions, determined to end
by suicide his lonely existence, so he alighted
on a fly-paper, partook of the poison thereon,
and prepared himself for death, but to his
surprise he found that instead of death or
disease he had made a good and healthy meal
-the fly-paper was adulterated.</p><p>
No remedy for adulteration of the food and
drink of the poor is possible until the present
tangle of local government is cut away. To
burden East End ratepayers with a large
increase to the existing inspectorial staff is
impracticable and unjust. The equalization of
rates is a measure which must precede any
serious effort to grapple with the widespread
degradation of food. The next step is to
increase the numbers of the <orgName key="Inspectors of
Nuisances">Inspectors of
Nuisances</orgName>, and to support those gentlemen
in their task by inflicting far more serious
punishment on adulterators than is possible
under existing legislation. Increased severity
in the punishment for this class of offence is
justified in the interests of posterity.  If
public opinion is ripe for the imprisonment
of those who are guilty of adulterating

             <pb id="p.163" n="163"/>
bayonets, or supplying unserviceable guns,
there is but a short step to be traversed in
order to treat as criminal whoever impairs the
stamina of the next generation by selling
garbage as food, or poison as drink. The
evil is national in its dimensions. Nothing
short of the exercise of national will can
abate and extinguish a system unknown to
the heathen, which has already lost to
England some of her foreign trade in calicoes and
cottons, and which justly exposes her to the
contempt and hatred of the simpler and less
civilized nations of the earth.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII: Drink</head><p>
As the foot and not the shoemaker is the
cause of the shoe, so we must look farther
afield for the causes of drunkenness than the
present state of the licensing laws. Without
the stimulus of legislation the upper classes
have become, in two generations, habitually
temperate. A sot is no longer regarded by
society with the easy temper prevailing at the
beginning of the nineteenth century. Prince
Bismarck-whose feats with the tankard
excite the loving admiration of Busch-speaks
of the time when the consumption of strong
waters and "huge cups of mixed champagne
and porter" were "the indispensable passports

        <pb id="p.165" n="165"/>
into the  diplomatic service."  Two
hundred years ago the chief pleasures of the
country gentlemen of England were
commonly derived from unrefined sensuality. The
quantity of beer consumed in those days was
enormous. Beer was then not only all that
beer is now, but filled the place, to a large
extent, of wine, tea, coffee, chocolate, liqueurs,
and ardent spirits. Since the Revolution the
drinking habits of the cultivated classes have
gradually lessened, until the vice of
drunkenness has become the characteristic of the
lower and not of the upper stratum of society.
Melancholy and monotonous as the lot of the
poorest men in a great city must necessarily
be, with all the earth but mud and dust
paved away from under their feet, and the
blue sky always hidden by a canopy of smoke,
the imagination is only to be stirred by resort
to the stimulus of alcohol, or to the
excitements of emotional religion.</p><p>
Sicilian peasants sing and dance in the
intervals of toil under the witchery of
sunshine, fruit, and flowers. English labourers of
the cities take their pleasure under the
stinging impulse of vitriolic intoxicants. Between

<pb id="p.166" n="166"/>
abstinence and excess there is no middle path
In the submerged stratum of which we are
speaking, I am unable to discover the
existence of a temperate class, although the
abstinent class is larger than is generally
supposed. Abstinence and undue indulgence
seem to be the only available alternatives.
While, therefore, the so-called "Temperance"
movement receives great support from the
existence of prevailing excess, it has
extinguished the moderate class by silencing
the moderate men. There is nothing
lessthan an infinite difference in morality and
in destiny between a sober and an intemperate
man. To confound temperance with total
abstinence, which is now the shibboleth of
the Temperance Reformers, is to trifle with
language, fact, and character. The results
of such insincerity are disastrous. Kingsley,
who was a man before he was a clergyman,
prophesied the consequences of such a
Procrustean policy, and the condition of our great
cities is witness to the accuracy of his
anticipations. Strictly sober men are hustled into
shame-faced silence by the innuendoes of
abstinent fanatics.  What is the result ?

               <pb id="p.167" n="167"/>
Families, schools, churches, trades clubs,
who are not taught the doctrine of abstinence,
are left untaught on the whole question of
alcoholic enjoyment. A population drenched
with strong drink, degraded and impoverished
beyond the experience of history, are invited
to relinquish what is practically their only
form of enjoyment, and the invitation is
couched in the language of a counsel of
perfection. The common people have never
responded to the suggestions of heroic
selfdenial, or to a counsel of perfection, and it
is unlikely that the mass of the English
people will, in our time, affiliate themselves
with the United Kingdom Alliance.</p><p>
The remedy must be sought elsewhere.
In the re-housing of the poor, in the
provision of rational entertainments, in the
exercise of a more vigilant supervision over
the character and purity of the liquors
retailed in the public houses, and in a vigorous
reform of the licensing laws may be found
material contributions to the solution of one
of the greatest of our national problems.
The enthusiastic outbreak of moderate men
in favour of organic changes in the method

<pb id="p.168" n="168"/>
of grappling with drunkenness is essential to
a rational and successful treatment of the
temperance question. Too-much honour is
paid by successive Governments to the drink
interests.  Beer is coronetted by grateful
Ministers; whisky and porter, by the sheer
weight of their influence, acquire hereditary
distinction without an effort. That Medicine
should be without one representative in the
House of Lords, while the drink which
provides them with most of their patients is
crowned with glory and honour, is repugnant
to common sense. If we drank ourselves
out of the Alabama Claims we have drunk
ourselves into a singularly shameful position
as a torch-bearer of civilization. We do not
hold the torch upright, and we have burnt all
the dependent tribes with whom  we have
come in contact in foreign parts.</p><p>
American working men, especially the
Scandinavians, enjoy their lager beer and
are strictly temperate.  The absence of a
pure and mildly stimulating beverage for
habitual use is, perhaps, one of the chief
causes of habitual excess in England. If it be
unlikely that the whole nation will ever consent

             <pb id="p.169" n="169"/>
to total abstinence, the reasonable course to
pursue is to limit the necessary evil, to purify
the drink, and to supply other resources for
the employment of their time to those who
are driven to the low beershop by the sheer
necessities and unlovely conditions of their
lives.</p><p>
Public opinion is now so strongly in favour
of some form of local option as a means of
cutting off the supply and thus reducing the
consumption, it is desirable, at all events, to
try the experiment, and no more favourable
field of operations could be found than those
densely populated neighbourhoods which are
at once inhabited by the poorest and most
degraded of mankind, and dominated by the
brewing and publican interests. American
experience of local option is by no means
conclusive of a successful result ensuing
from this class of legislation. Whether the
passion for drink be extinguished, or whether
it be gratified by stealth, or on the
circumference of the prescribed area, is a moot
point. On the <placeName key="Shaftesbury Estate in
Battersea">Shaftesbury Estate in
Battersea</placeName>, where no public-house is allowed to be
erected, the inhabitants are remarkable for

<pb id="p.170" n="170"/>
their freedom from pauperism or crime.  On
the other hand the circumference of the estate
is fringed with public-houses, so that the heart
of the district alone is preserved from the
temptation presented freely to those dwelling
farther from the centre.  To draw correct
inferences it is necessary that observations
should not be based on experiments
conducted in too restricted an area. The district
chosen should either be compact-that is,
square or circular in form-or better still,
should include the whole area of a town or
city.  The results following the closure of
disorderly houses in a densely populated
parish seem to show that transfer and not
extinction of evil is the consequence of action
within too limited an area, bordered on all
sides by a dense population possessing similar
characteristics to that affected by the
exclusion of facilities for the sale of drink.
</p><p>With regard to rivals to the public-house,
nothing will succeed in attracting the mass of
the people unless it is really entertaining, at
all events, in the first instance.  Recreation
and not instruction is what the poor folk
lack. A house for the public where good

            <pb id="p.171" n="171"/>
comic songs, free from the grossness and
suggestiveness so common in the
publichouse "free-and-easy," will draw hundreds,
especially if the performers, or some of
them, will take personal interest in the
cares and welfare of the audience. In
a short time, when relations have been
established between the hearers and the
entertainers, the comic element may be replaced
by music of a higher grade. Gradually as
intelligence awakes, bright, short lectures on
popular topics, easy science, physiology,
English history, travels, and biography excite
the liveliest interest, and, in a large proportion
of cases, lead to the abandonment of the more
bestial methods of whiling away of leisure
hours.  An occasional concert is useless
Open a house for the public, and have some
form of excitement provided three or four
times a week, and especially on Sunday
evenings, and in a short time, and after the
exercise of patience and good temper, the
people who came to laugh remain to learn.
Such houses for the public can be held
wherever a large room or small hall is
available. They cost but little. A large staff of

<pb id="p.172" n="172"/>
volunteers is indispensable, since few  are
willing or able to attend more than once or
twice a month. It is to be wished that the
churches, chapels, synagogues, school board
buildings, and vestry halls were available
nightly for the recreation of the people.
Dumb churches, buildings in the midst of a
brain-soaked population, would seem to be
exactly fitted for the real elevation of the
habits of the poor. Clerical prejudice,
however, for the most part favours the
reservation of these buildings for the vocabulary of
religion; although the good effects of a
constant and prolonged employment of this
vocabulary are not traceable in the lives
and habits of the great mass of the poorest
classes. If you wish to get at the people,
you must be, not seem, as they are.   It
is not necessary to dress or to talk as
they do. But the special dress and the
professional talk of many of the clergy erect
impassable barriers between the churches and
the drinking people. It is hopeless to expect
that a paid professional class can alone carry
into effect a revolution in lives and habits
which are so largely the results of the neglect

             <pb id="p.173" n="173"/>
by the whole of the community. Each
member of society must own to himself or herself
the existence of inalienable responsibility
which cannot be evaded by a cheque, or
discharged by the languid profession of an
unpersecuted creed. The drunkenness of great
cities is the result of causes for which every
comfortable adult is individually and directly
responsible. The relentless exertion of the
public conscience and the public, and nothing
less, will, without fear of labour, or favour of
interests, now, even in this decade, mend or
end many of the sources of evil which lead to
wasting tyranny of habitual excess in
intoxicating liquors.</p><p>
The concentrated expenditure of &#x00A3; 100,000

Delight, to rival the myriad public-houses, is
a dissipation of energy. Poor men cannot

Public-houses are prosperous because they are

would reach a larger public than a central

Drink in <placeName key="East End">the East End</placeName> is not a local, it is
an Imperial question. The passionate longing
for excitement, and the longing to escape
from the destiny of ugliness and pain, which
kills family life in East End homes, is evidence
of that rough energy which has dominated
weaker races in all parts of the world. We
have carried from our great cities a
worldgirdling influence of appetite and passion.
The Indians of America and of Hindostan,
the wild races of <placeName key="Australia">Australia</placeName>, the kingly
Maories, timid Kanakas, fighting Kaffirs
and debased Hottentots, West Coast
negroes, effeminate Sinhalese, and the sinewy
aborigines of Canada and the North Pacific
Coastal islands, have bitter reasons  to
rue the first day of their encounter with the
Anglo-Saxon race. The drinking habits of
great cities have permeated the world.
Diamond and   gold  mines, worked with
English capital, and carried on under the
            <pb id="p.175" n="175"/>
skilled administration of English engineers,
are the baleful centres of waste and death,
which cargoes of missionaries neither
influence nor destroy.  Every man who leaves
England is a missionary. He is a standard
by which English civilization is gauged.
England has been betrayed by her sons
abroad. Eight centuries of noble deeds do
not atone for the devil's work of one. The
simplest ideal of a nation, as of an individual,
is, that contact with her shall leave no stain
on others. England has not stained; she has
polluted with drink and honey-combed with
foul disease the lives of those races who still
survive a contact all unsought by them. We
have done these things, and they cannot be
undone.  Repentance, if sincere, can only
take the form of purging our great cities.
St. Boniface wrote to the Archbishop of
Canterbury in 800, " I hear that you Saxons
are mighty drinkers of ale, and that you are
worse than the Jews and heathen about me."
It was true, and in a thousand years we have
gone from bad to worse. I absolutely
disbelieve in the power of law to change habits
which are accessible only to the highest

<pb id="p.176" n="176"/>
moral and intellectual influences.
Nevertheless, there are some abuses capable of being
arrested by wise legislation.  The series of
temperance measures passed by the
Norwegian Storthing, and known generally as
the Gothenburg system, has changed an
immoderate into a moderate consumption of
alcoholic liquors. This system was tried in
the first instance in the smaller towns and
villages.  At the beginning of <date value="1886">1886</date>, the
capital, Christiana, was included among the
areas subject to the liquor laws, so great
were the results achieved by the trial in
smaller areas.  The main features of the
Gothenburg system are-</p><p>
1. That alcoholic drinks are dispensed by
persons deriving no profit from the sale.</p><p>
2. That the profits arising from the sale
are employed by the local authority towards
the expense of local government and the
reduction of rates.</p><p>
3. That food is sold to, and partaken of
by customers at the time when drink is
purchased.</p><p>
The genius of the English character would
probably resent the last provision; but the

               <pb id="p.177" n="177"/>
transfer of pecuniary interest in sales from
the seller to the local authority is a valuable
principle, which may be well worth trying
when we have a system of local government
capable of discharging functions similar to
those so successfully carried out by
Norwegian Mayors and Counsellors.
</p><p>It is clear that no diminution of drinking
habits can occur without a diminution of
drink produced and supplied, and therefore
without a reduction of trade profits.  Any
measures, whether legislative or philanthropic,
having for their object the sobriety of the
English people, must necessarily be a direct
attack on the drink interest. This being so,
it is hopeless to expect to evade the hostility
of the licensed victuallers, or of the beer
barons.  Reasonable compensation should
be granted for the extinction of bon&#x00EE;-fide
interests, since confiscation sanctioned in
one department of civil life will not remain
content with a single victory. Justice, and
nothing more than justice, should be
conceded. It will be well to suspend for the
present the creation of baronets and peers
connected with the drink interests, as however
<pb id="p.178" n="178"/>
worthy they may be in other respects, the
distinctions conferred on those gentlemen are
apt to give an erroneous impression to
uncivilized heathen races as to the degree of
honour in which drink trafficking is held by
the better class of Englishmen.

<quote rend="blockquote">" After having carefully examined the
proposals of the leading German Socialists, and
after having read the proceedings of the

been held in recent years, I think it will be
admitted that the following is a full and fair
statement of the programme of modern
Socialism:-</quote>
</p><p>" 1. That there should be no private
property, and that no one should be
permitted to acquire property by inheritance.
That all should be compelled to labour, no
one having a right to live without labour.
</p><p>"2. The nationalization of the land, and
of the other instruments of production; or,
in other words, the State should own all the
land, capital, and machinery, in fact,
everything which constitutes the industrial plant,
of a country-in order that every industry
may be carried on by the State.
</p><p>" These proposals to prohibit inheritance,

          <pb id="p.183" n="183"/>
to abolish private property, and to make the
State the owner of all the capital and the
administrator of the entire industry of the
country, are put forward as representing
Socialism in its ultimate and highest
development. <orgName key="The Socialists">The Socialists</orgName> themselves admit
that as there is no immediate prospect of
obtaining their objects in a complete form, it
will be desirable to put forward proposals
which involve a less fundamental change, and
the following may consequently be regarded
as the objects to be first striven for. These
objects are regarded as not only desirable in
themselves, but are looked upon as
facilitating the complete realization of the Socialistic
idea :-
</p><p>"1. The establishment of co-operative
agricultural  and  manufacturing  associations
supported by the State.
</p><p>"2. Universal, compulsory, and free education.
</p><p>"3. A progressive income-tax and the

are:-</p><p>
1. Abolition of inheritance.</p><p>

As, however, any statement of the

section or other of the party, I have asked <persName key="Champion, Mr. Henry Hyde">Mr.
Henry Hyde Champion</persName> to state briefly his
views on the Socialistic panacea of which he
is so courageous and, it must be added, so
unselfish an advocate.
<quote rend="blockquote">"I am asked to briefly state, as one of the <orgName key="Social
Democrats ">Social
Democrats </orgName>in England, my views on these problems. I will not
waste words in describing the horrors of our existing
society. Where I shall differ from the readers of this

                   <pb id="p.185" n="185"/>
book is in ascribing our social ills almost entirely to
economical causes over which man has control, and to
the consequent material degradation in which the workers
have to live. This engenders the disease, folly, and vice
which, surely enough, react on the environment and
increase the almost hopeless misery. But the first point
of the infernal circle is the poverty to which five-sixths of
the population are condemned. In other words,
uncertainty of employment and low wages for long hours
when in work are the main causes of the evils we all
profess to deplore. Let any doubting reader think for a
moment whether a thousand infants taken from the slums
of a great town, and brought up in wholesome physical
surroundings, would  show, notwithstanding inherited
tendencies, such stunted frames, dwarfed intelligences,
and warped sympathies as a thousand others who had
been left in the slums to be suckled on gin, poisoned by
foul air, corrupted by filth and bad food, and crippled by
premature toil. No one who clears his mind of illusions
can deny that physical health is the basis of moral and
mental health, and that all talk of improvement for the
masses is the cruellest hypocrisy until their material
conditions are altered.
"Why, then, are the workers poor ? Social Democracy
says, because they have to provide the rent, profits, and
interest on which the idlers live; because the modern
capitalist form  of production forces them to maintain
large numbers of useless middlemen; and, because
laboursaving machinery, improvements in industry, and gluts
due to mad competition throw thousands out of work.
For instance, why are the railway and tramway servants

<pb id="p.186" n="186"/>
wretchedly paid for inhuman hours of work ? Simply
because those concerns are run in the interest of
shareholders whose object is to get dividends by exacting the
maximum of work for the minimum of pay. Why are the
800,000 agricultural workers, whose labour, with the aid of
sun and rain, creates &#x00A3;240,000,000 of produce annually,
constantly "suffering from  diseases due to insufficient
nourishment ?" Because they only get what is left of
their produce after satisfying the claims of idlers,
speculators, and middlemen. Why are men by the hundred
thousand now out of work ? Because every improvement
in manufacture is used by the capitalist to save wages
and because the modern captains of industry in their
blind race for wealth overstock the markets. The workers
of England can produce more wealth than would provide
them with all the means for happy and healthy existence,
but they cannot meet the exorbitant demands of the
useless classes and have enough left to keep themselves
with a sound mind in a sound body.
"The awful condition of the people is recognised by
many well-meaning persons, who hope that the classes
who profit by long hours, low wages, and the presence of
'the reserve army of labour,' may be persuaded to use
the power their property gives them in accordance with
the dictates of humanity and the spirit of the Christian
religion.  They say, in effect, 'Then must the Jew be
merciful.'  Our modern Shylock answers, ' On what
compulsion must I ?  Tell me that,' and pauses for a
reply. <orgName key="Social Democrats">Social Democrats</orgName> (alone, as I think) are ready
with an effective one. The only possible conclusion after
an examination of the history of class antagonisms in the
past is that the workers must compel the idlers to earn

                <pb id="p.187" n="187"/>
their own living by depriving them of the power of
preying on others which the possession of land and capital
now secures to them. Industry must be organized, not
for the profit of the few on a competitive basis, but for
the benefit of all by co-operation. This transformation of
society-the abolition of classes, the expropriation of the
property holders, and the reorganization of industry-is
the social revolution we are striving to hasten.  'But the
possessing classes will fight rather than surrender their
privilege of profiting by the misery and overwork of
others ' ? If so, the workers, thousands of whom are
annually killed or mutilated by preventible accidents, who
live on the average only half as long as the middle and
upper classes, and who compose the army and police,
cannot hesitate to choose the risk of sudden death rather
than the certainty of life-long misery, when the truth
about their position is clear to them  and success seems
probable.  In these nation-cities how could a determined
rising of the victims be suppressed ? Does not God fight
on the side of the big battalions? It is possible, however,
and certainly devoutly to be wished, that the defenders of
vested rights will have the wit to calculate the odds, and
surrender-as the Irish landlords have done, with bad
grace possibly, but without resort to the last argument of
force.
"I think I am expressing the opinion of the vast
majority of <orgName key="Socialists">Socialists</orgName> when I say that there are many
practical steps-in the direction of democratising the
administration of the country, in extending the control of
the community over industry, in limiting the excesses of
competition, and in preparing for the reorganization of
society on a collectivist system-which we should rejoice

<pb id="p.188" n="188"/>
to see, while still relentlessly pressing for the complete
change: such are adult suffrage, payment of members and
of election expenses, the second ballot, shorter parliaments,
the nationalization of railways and mines, the
municipalization of gas and waterworks and of working-class
dwellings, the limitation of the hours of labour, a graduated
income tax, free education and the feeding of children in
board schools, and the application of our principles to the
relief of the unemployed-these things could be done at
once, and if carried out in time without the suppression
of freedom of the press and platform, might pave the way
to a peaceful reconstruction of society.
"Rapidly as the movement is growing in England, we

          <pb id="p.189" n="189"/>
of all that makes life worth living, "The
Times " attracts attention to the improvement
in the Nordenfeldt gun, and publishes the
recommendations of an expert on the best
method of street fighting. The
condemnation of skilled mechanics in times of trouble
to the disintegration of granite blocks, at a
wage of tenpence per diem, creates a sense
of the general unfitness of things, which finds
expression in an expansive demand for forced
community of goods. On the other hand, the
fracture of a few club windows impels the
owner of property to cry for " resolute
govermment," that he may continue to address to his
soul an injunction to take its ease in peace
and comfort. There is, I believe, a middle
path, and it is on this that I join issue with
Mr. <persName key="Champion, Mr.Henry Hyde">Champion</persName> and the sanguinary faddists
with whom he acts, when they attribute the
social horrors we all recognize almost entirely
to economical causes. Moral wrong seems
to me to lie at the root of the evil, and of this
the <orgName key="Social Democrats">Social Democrats</orgName> take no account. The
reduction of English Christianity to a
caricature of the Sermon on the Mount lends to Mr.
<persName key="Champion, Mr.Henry Hyde">Champion</persName> and his colleagues a weapon of infinite

<pb id="p.190" n="190"/>
 strength. Christianity says, " Mine is
thine."  Mr. <persName key="Champion, Mr.Henry Hyde">Champion</persName> says, "Thine is
mine."  Here is the whole difference.
Christianity does not fulfil her profession. Mr.
<persName key="Champion, Mr.Henry Hyde">Champion</persName> is ready to fulfil his. It may be
that the ideal is too high; that the rich will
always be too sorrowful-without a physical
struggle-to part with the portion of goods
needed to stay the coming war of classes.
Then, and in that case, wild work is ahead,
and the struggle can end but in one way.</p><p>
The case of Robinson Crusoe and his island
has often been, and may again be, adduced
as an example of the fundamental rights of
property. With a nail and a stone he fashions,
with infinite toil, a canoe, by which he can
visit reefs and islets for crabs and turtle eggs,
the wherewithal to mend his fare. Friday,
naked and hungry, makes Crusoe's
acquaintance, and, admiring the boat and the
goatskin clothing, issues the following platform or
programme, which is that of the <orgName key="Social
Democratic Federation">Social
Democratic Federation</orgName>, adapted to the
circumstances of <persName key="Fernandez, Juan">Juan Fernandez</persName>.
The platform pronounces-</p><p>
(1). " The establishment of a free condition

      <pb id="p.191" n="191"/>
of society on <persName key="Fernandez, Juan">Juan Fernandez</persName>, based on the
principle of political equality, with equal social
rights for both."</p><p>
(2). "The land, with all caves, gardens,
bark dwellings, goats, fowls, and other forms
of property, to be declared and treated as
collective or common property."</p><p>
(3). "The State appropriation of canoes,
and other means of transit, with or without
compensation."</p><p>
Friday presents this programme to Crusoe,
and, in justification of his action, quotes the
phrase of Lassalle-" To every man according
to his needs." Crusoe's reply would depend
on his mood. Assuming the discussion to
proceed on philosophic lines, he would quote
Locke in defence of the property created by
the expenditure of labour on raw material.
To this Friday might rejoin with Provdhon's
well-known dictum, "Property is robbery."
Crusoe, not absolutely convinced by Friday's
reasoning, may not have the wit, as Mr.
<persName key="Champion, Mr.Henry Hyde">Champion</persName> says, "to calculate the odds and
surrender-as the Irish landlords have done 
 <note place="foot" n="1">By the way, the Irish landlords have done nothing of
the sort.</note>

<pb id="p.192" n="192"/>
-with bad grace, possibly, but without resort
to the last argument of force."  On the
contrary, Crusoe will fight, and Crusoe will be
right, and the debate will assume the form of
a personal encounter. If Crusoe has his
cutlass handy, and uses it promptly, Friday will
be lucky if he escapes with his life, and
anyhow will be convinced by Crusoe that he has
cause to regret his fidelity to the principles of
the <orgName key="Social-Democratic Federation">Social-Democratic Federation</orgName>.</p><p>
Substitute for Crusoe the eighteen million
holders of property in the United Kingdom,
and see how much pith and substance there is
in Mr. <persName key="Champion, Mr.Henry Hyde">Champion</persName>'s contention.</p><p>
Since the anomalous is often that which
works best in practice, it is possible to admit
all the horrors of the present system without
assenting to projects for its total destruction.
Of the   two  evils-(1) Mr. <persName key="Champion, Mr.Henry Hyde">Champion</persName>'s
nihilistic suppression of all moral sanctions,
and (2) the juxtaposition of luxury and want
as it now exists-the latter seems to be
immeasurably the less. But because it is the
lesser, is no reason for leaving it alone.
Earnest, determined, and continuous efforts
by the State on the wholesome lines of the

             <pb id="p.193" n="193"/>
<title>Ten Commandments</title>, and by all individuals on
the softer and sweeter lines of the Mount;
to suppress and sterilize the evil-doer by the
one, and to visit affliction and redress wrong
by the other, if a harder task, is a nobler, and
yet more feasible ideal than the pitiless
gospel of plunder and insurrection preached
by Mr. <persName key="Champion, Mr.Henry Hyde">Champion</persName> and his colleagues.</p><p>
The awful selfishness and bovine content
of the comfortable classes-especially of the
middle-class-are destined to some such
shock as that at which Mr. <persName key="Champion, Mr.Henry Hyde">Champion</persName> hints,
unless they awake out of sleep. Political
economy has been employed too much as
though it were an end in itself. Mr. Bright,
<orgName key="the Manchester school">the Manchester school</orgName>, and the unrestricted
rights of property, have had too long an
innings.  The premium  of insurance paid
by property to cover the risk of social
earthquake is too low. It must be raised-and that
forthwith. The right inherent in every
workman to spend, save, and devise the product of
his labour, is subject to two moral
considerations-one of which is that the process shall
not be directly or indirectly the necessary
cause of misery to others ; and the other, that

<pb id="p.194" n="194"/>
the duties of property are as inherent as its
rights. Sweating toilers, house farmers, and
corrupt vestrymen infringe these moral laws.
The consequences of their evil-doing, and
of the ignorant apathy of the public in
abetting them, are visited on the nation by the
scandal and the shame that have generated
the poisonous propaganda of <orgName key="Social

Equality of opportunity does not, in this

Competition is inherent in human nature.
Pushed too far it leads to wicked cheapness,
and costs men's lives and girls' honour. To
abolish competition, as the Socialists propose,
is to create a new spirit in the hearts of men.
This they cannot do, as the constant
bickerings in, and secessions from, the Socialist
party appear effectively to demonstrate. The
desire of <orgName key="Social
Democrats">Social
Democrats</orgName> to abolish the
competitive system, because  the
consequences of unrestricted  competition  are
deadly to some and hurtful to many, can
be compared only with a desire to abolish
the use of fire because in many instances lives
are lost, limbs maimed, and property
destroyed by the cruel license of uncontrolled
flames. Competition, like fire, is an excellent
servant: when subordinated to the higher
laws lying beyond the purview of
political economy.   Grates, stoves, chimneys,
fire bars, bellows, tongs, and water, are
needed for the due subjugation of the
competitive principle.  Tramway men and the
white slaves of the tailoring trade in the
East End are scorched by the fire of the
struggle for existence, and for the infliction
of those injuries Society is directly responsible.

Society of common responsibility for the
evils of unrestricted competition. It cannot
be alleged that there is an essential difference
-a difference in principle-between the serfs
of sweating tailors or <orgName key="Metropolitan Tramway
Companies"> Metropolitan Tramway
Companies in <date value="1886">1886</date>, and the Lancashire
operative</orgName>s of <date value="1833">1833</date>. The difference, if any,
is one of degree, not of kind. It cannot be
difficult, if this be so, to arrive at a principle
determining the proper limits for the
interference of the State, and defining the
circumstances when the interference of the
State is injurious alike to the interests of
industry and of capital, and to the
wholesomeness and independence of national life.
</p><p>That principle may be briefly stated thus:-
No person or persons are vested with inherent
rights to profit arising from the misery and
degradation of others.</p><p>
Fragmentary acceptances of this principle
are scattered up and down the Statute Book.
In 48 and 49 Vict., ch. 72, section 12, we
have these words :-
</p><p><quote rend="blockquote">" In any contract made after the passing of this Act
   <pb id="p.197" n="197"/>
for letting for habitation by persons of the working classes
a house or part of a house, there shall be implied a
condition that the house is at the commencement of the
holding in all respects reasonably fit for human
habitation."</quote></p><p>
The missing link in the application of this
admitted principle is the pecuniary inability
of the poor to set in motion on their own
behalf the machinery of the law, and the
corruption and apathy of the local authorities
who   are to the   poor in   loco parentis.
Thousands of house-owners in Great Britain
are now liable to an action at common law
for the insanitary condition of premises let
or sublet to working-class tenants since the
14th of August, <date value="1885">1885</date>; and it is probable
that they would be cast in heavy damages
for neglect of the condition implied in Section
12 of the <title>Housing of the Working Classes
Act, <date value="1885">1885</date></title>. Restricted competition in regard
to the disposal of insanitary and dilapidated
house property is a palpable admission by the
the State that no house-owner has the right
to make profits from the letting of houses,
the occupation of which is a necessary
cause of injury to the occupants.</p><p>
Unventilated mines, unpointed railways,

<pb id="p.198" n="198"/>
ships unseaworthy and half-found, are
instances where the intervention of the
community in its own protection is already
admitted. Once concede that the permanent
injury to health and stamina of that class,
known to the <orgName key="Social Democrats">Social Democrats</orgName> as " the
workers," is an injury to the community as
a whole, and the title for interference is
complete.  The acceptance of the principle I
have ventured to formulate would involve
a considerable increase to the inspectorial
staff, the abolition of the present form of
Local government, and a modification of the
<title>Employers' Liability Act</title> in the direction of
compulsory instead of optional provisions.
It will, no doubt, be said that profits will be
reduced.  This, no doubt, is possibly true;
and it is high time that profits should be
surrendered when they are obtained only at the cost
of national degradation. It is equally probable,
however, even on sordid grounds, that the
general improvement in the conditions of life
of the workers would be profitable to workmen
and to capitalists alike.</p><p>
A surrender of a portion of the profits now
legally made must be faced and endured.

 <pb id="p.199" n="199"/>
The premium of insurance paid by the
comfortable classes is not high enough to purchase
immunity from spoliation. The strain on the
intellect of the poor, when the contrast of
poisonous attics and sixteen hours' work
with no work and great comfort, is too great
for quiet acceptance.</p><p>
The considerations leading many of the
working classes to throw in their lot with the
Social Democrats are stated in the following
paper, which is being circulated throughout
the length and breadth of the kingdom.</p><p><title>
ARE YOU A SOCIAL DEMOCRAT?</title></p><p>
<quote rend="blockquote">If not, you ought to be, for the following reasons:-
Because in this wealthiest country the world has ever

part the results of want and the fear of want.
Because the average death-rate in the district of <placeName key="St.

is 11 per 1,000, while in poor, overcrowded districts the

Because in Manchester and other industrial centres the
working classes, on the average, live only half as long as
the idle classes.
Because thousands of men in the United Kingdom are
killed every year in mines, on railways, and in manufactories

<pb id="p.200" n="200"/>
 by " accidents " which could be prevented if money
was spent on improved methods of working.
Because the useful classes in England are forced to
work from 60 to 120 hours a week for a bare living, while
black slaves were usually only employed 45 hours a week
by their masters and were well fed.
Because official Government reports prove that the
800,000 agricultural labourers, who produce more than
&#x00A3;240,000,000 worth of food in a year even in these bad
times, rarely escape from "diseases due to insufficient
nourishment."
Because the <orgName key="Royal Commission on the Housing of the

Because women who work are habitually paid wages on
which they cannot live, and there are at least 100,000
prostitutes on the streets of London alone.
Because in every great industry the amount produced
per head of those employed has greatly increased, though
the number of men in work at these trades has in many
cases diminished.
Because it is admitted that children in Board Schools
are too badly fed to be well taught without breaking down;
and that in one of the poorer districts of London last
winter one child out of every three came to school without
having had any breakfast.
Because everything that the worker gets to eat, drink, and

                <pb id="p.201" n="201"/>

The statements in this paper are
substantially true, and it is pitiful that a poison
should be prescribed as a remedy by those
who are slowly and surely winning the
confidence of the masses: and that the poison
should be accepted with avidity, because the
natural leaders of the people are silently
engaged in other things.    Were the
middleclasses, with their comfort-worship and their
clinging attachment to respectability, to
wake out of sleep and to grasp the fact that
the next revolution will be directed against
them-against      the   bourgeoisie, and    not
against the aristocracy-all might yet go well.
The Local Government of London is the
embodiment of the bourgeois spirit. What
wonder then that Socialists seek the
salvation of some in the destruction of all;

<pb id="p.202" n="202"/>
would fain visit on the nation the sins of
the classes; would atone for selfish
indifference by the letting loose of passion;
and would seek the reconstruction of society
by the destruction of civilization. The
handwriting is on the wall. Day by day the
characters become more legible. As the
ocean murmurs ceaselessly is the murmuring
of the people. They are, as Kropotkine says,
"a multitude whom no man can number;
they are the ocean that can embrace and
swallow up all else." Discontent, the daughter
of education, breeds resolve; resolve,
revolution. Remove from the revolutionist just
reason for uprooting the foundations of
society, and moral considerations will support
the physical measures undertaken in
defending property and the old order of society.</p><p>
Science has immensely strengthened the
arm of the individual when raised against
society. Explosives, easily manufactured,
manipulated by one determined man may at
any time change the history of Europe. Fear
is no reason for hastening the action of
justice. Still, there is every advantage in
depriving the dynamitards of the

        <pb id="p.203" n="203"/>
<orgName key="SocialDemocratic party">SocialDemocratic party</orgName> of the semblance of
injustice. It must be confessed that much of
the responsibility for the blind fury bred of
continual woe is to be laid on the shoulders
of society. Neglect and hypocrisy conspire
to assist the teachings of the communistic
propaganda. Repair the neglect and sweep
away the hypocrisy with resolution and an
honest heart, and the Council of the Social
Democratic Federation will warble to the
unemployed without causing them to twirl in
the dance of death.</p><p>
Again and again the leaders of Socialism
have announced their intention of
confiscating, in whole or in part, property in land
and in all the means of production. Among
all their schemes of forced loans, graduated
taxes, irredeemable currency, confiscation,
and collectivism, there is never found a
solitary appeal to the higher sense of the
working classes. That much of the misery
which appals every thoughtful man arises
from  idleness as well as from overwork;
from too short hours as well as from too
prolonged a period of labour; from gluttony and
guzzling, as well as from ascetic abstinence;

<pb id="p.204" n="204"/>
from reckless unthrift, indulgence, profligacy,
and dissipation-does not enter into the
Socialistic propaganda. According to them,
if a man of the working classes is a voluptuous
prodigal within the limits of his capacity and
means of enjoyment, he has become so in
consequence of the sins of other people. I contend
that the idle poor are as distinctly the enemies
of the virtuous poor as the idle rich. This,
however, is not the Socialist view. With them the
remedy for all poverty, arising from whatever
cause, is the confiscation of other people's
goods.</p><p>
What is to be done with criminals under
the new Co-operative Commonwealth is thus
good-humouredly pointed out by Gronlund:
</p><p>"We may now add that not only crimes
against property, but all forms of crime
will probably be practically unknown."</p><p>
While human nature is what it is the
punishment of idleness ought to consist in allowing
free play to the consequences of idleness. A
great impulse to the sterilization of the unfit
would be given if the idle man were allowed
to die unpitied in the street. The crapulous
tenderness extended by the nineteenth century

          <pb id="p.205" n="205"/>
 to suffering arising from any and from
every cause, is the most fertile mother of
hereditary pauperism, and all that hereditary
pauperism implies. The old Book says, " If a
man will not work neither shall he eat." The
new edition of the Book, sub-edited to date,
absorbs within the scope of its sickly
sympathy the misery of the man who will not
work. None are better acquainted with the
truth of this charge than the industrious poor
themselves. We need a wholesome return to
that benevolence which was good enough for
the prophets and seers of former days. It
excluded from the scope of action the interests
of the idle man.  But the field remaining
afforded, and affords, ample play for the finest
feelings, for the most devoted energies, for the
exercise of the highest capacity, and the
display of the most exalted sacrifice. The
sinews of our humanity have slackened since
it became easier to relieve the idle when
they are in trouble, than to seek and to save
those who are too proud to ask for alms. As
a general rule, the man who can ask charity of
strangers is not worthy to receive it.
Exceptions naturally occur; but these exceptions

<pb id="p.206" n="206"/>
are not to be counted as forming a rule. The
unfathomable tenderness and wisdom of the
Bible never includes in its code of duty the
care of the criminally idle.</p><p>
State-help may be poured into the Socialistic
sack until the State is bankrupt, but without
self-help and the stimulus of need the pouring
out of State aid is done to waste.  Self-help
gives industrial partnerships, trades'-unions,
co-operative and building societies.  The
demagogues who undermine the self-help
which produces these results cannot be
counted friendly to the poor man when he
offers him as an alternative the million
bayonets that will infallibly be raised in
defence of family life and the rights of
property. Legislation that impairs the spirit of
self-help is hostile to social progress.
Legislation that restricts the energies of
competition so as to allow free play to all
competitors develops wholesomely the spirit
of self-help.</p><p>
Whatsoever things are of good report, the
greatest deeds in our eight centuries of
island-story, the stirring record of many noble
lives, and the firm resolve that fills the minds

            <pb id="p.207" n="207"/>
of men of action, are the results of self-help
well and rightly exercised.  The whinings
of the modern school for Jupiter to come
down and make all men wise and happy and
virtuous by the intervention of the State is a
prayer hitherto ungranted, and, if England is
to retain what is best in her ancient spirit,
will remain ungranted by the new Democracy
now and for all time to come.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="Chapter X: The Poor Man's Budget" id="c10">
<head>CHAPTER X: The Poor Man's Budget</head><p>
THE typical income of a poor man is that of
an average labourer, such as a scaffolder or
builder's labourer.  A scaffolder possesses a
modicum of skill, and earns therefore
somewhat higher wages than the hodman or
bricklayer's man. Full time is fifty-two hours
and a half in a week, which at sixpence an
hour amounts to &#x00A3; 1 6s. 3d. Assuming that
the man is in the prime of life-say thirty
years of age-he will probably be married and
have a family of three children. Wages are
paid at noon on Saturday, and he will
probably there and then drink, or treat his mates
to an average of, two pots of beer at fourpence

       <pb id="p.209" n="209"/>
a pot; and he will spend on beer and tobacco
together not less than five shillings a week
on the average of one week with another.</p><p>
Although it is not the custom to give credit for
drink at public-houses, it is not unusual to do
so at beer-houses, where a request to " stick
it up " is seldom refused if the customer be
known, and is in work. Some publicans refuse
to give credit for drink, as they are unable to
sue for tippling debts.  They, therefore,
evade the statute by lending the drinker the
equivalent of his debt in cash, and then,
in the event of his being unable or
unwilling to pay, they sue him for money lent.
The practice of gambling for drink with
dominoes is unusual in what are known as
"stand-up" houses, or houses where spirits
are sold; but dominoes are often kept in
beerhouses for the purpose of enabling the
landlord's customers to determine by resort to a
game of chance the person upon whom the
burden of payment should fall. The usual
drink is colloquially known as "four-ale,"
so called because it is fourpence a pot, and
this, divided with " four-half," which is a
mixture of porter, or black beer, and " four-ale,"


<pb id="p.210" n="210"/>
obtains the suffrages of most of the drinkers.
If this beer be drunk off the premises and is
sent for in the customer's jug the price will be
reduced to threepence-halfpenny a pot, or
sometimes to threepence. In the opinion of
some intelligent working  men,
beershopkeepers are bound to doctor their beer in
order to pay rates, rent, and taxes; the beer
thus treated is said to be " faked," and on
Saturday and Sunday, more than on any
other part of the week, the occult treatment
of beer is in operation. The sales are larger
on these two days than on any other two days
in the week, especially in the lower houses,
and it is alleged that many publicans, and
most barmen, have their especial secrets for
the treatment of the beverages received from
the brewer.  Beershop-keepers devote a
regular portion of their time to the
management of their cellars, and the analysis
of beer sold on Saturday night, or after
church time on Sunday, would be interesting.
The labourers of the building trade who have
often to relinquish work, especially in the
spring, in consequence of rain, are attracted
to those beershops where they can get credit;

      <pb id="p.211" n="211"/>
and in the lower class of houses the
beershopkeeper is generally a pot-boy or barman who
has risen from the ranks, and is not seldom a
cunning and selfish member of the
community.</p><p>
Although beer in its various forms is most
constantly drunk, other beverages chiefly
consumed are gin-as being the cheapest, and
therefore more easily sophisticated-and rum
and new whisky. A not unusual
consumption of beer for an average labourer is
halfa-pint at eleven a.m., one pint at one p.m.,
half-a-pint at three p.m., and a pint and a half
after tea, that would come to four shillings
and a penny a week, leaving elevenpence for
tobacco, and no margin for getting drunk.
Complaints are rife that some of the beer is
terribly bad, it creates thirst, and even a small
quantity involves a morning headache.</p><p>
The price of gin is from fourpence-halfpenny
 to fivepence per quartern. Although
it is usual for potmen of neighbouring
beerhouses to visit bricklayers and labourers on
small building jobs, drinking is not allowed
on large jobs, which are therefore not so
popular among a large class as those of more

<pb id="p.212" n="212"/>
restricted dimensions.  The character of the
liquor supplied varies with the character of
the public-houses.</p><p>
Taking, then, four shillings and a penny as
the average weekly expenditure on drink by a
labourer throughout the year, it appears that he
spends in the course of a year &#x00A3; 10 12s. 4d. As
he pays twopence a pint for his beer it is
evident that he loses by retail consumption.
Taking the price of a nine-gallon cask of pure
beer at ten shillings, if he were able to buy
seventeen nine-gallon casks of beer instead of
1,274 pints he would have about &#x00A3;2 2s. 4d.
in hand, which would be a valuable addition
to the fund available for schooling, clothes, or
food, without reducing the consumption of
liquor he is accustomed to enjoy.</p><p>
The tobacco smoked by the labourer is
almost exclusively known as shag.  Shag
tobacco is generally bought over the bar of
the public-house, at twopence the half-ounce
or a penny the " screw." Assuming that the
weight is accurately measured, which is by
no means always the case, the price per
pound avoirdupois of this shag tobacco would
be five shillings and fourpence. A labourer

      <pb id="p.213" n="213"/>
will smoke three ounces a week in the year of
fifty-two weeks. This makes 156 ozs., which
at fourpence an ounce is &#x00A3;2 12s.; if he were
to buy his tobacco a pound at a time instead
of in small quantities, apart from the loss by
weight, which is often considerable, he would
have a further sum of sixteen shillings
available for the general purposes of a family,
without reducing the quantity of tobacco in
which he indulges. Most labourers have a
pipe in their mouths whenever possible. As a
class they smoke more than mechanics.
Investigations I have made as to the proportion
of smokers show that no fewer than from
ninety to ninety-four per cent. of labourers,
whether in or out of work, either smoke or
chew.</p><p>
The rent is a heavy item, and
accommodation generally bad. The model
dwellings, especially the Peabody Buildings,
are not inhabited by labourers, and it is hardly
too much to say that at present the
accommodation for men of the lower wage-earning
class has not been touched by the provision
of model dwellings. If our scaffolder is an
Irishman he will probably live in one room, for

<pb id="p.214" n="214"/>
which he pays not less than four shillings a
week; and if he pays his rent regularly he is
not only profitable to his " middleman "
landlord, but is paying to the latter an insurance
against the delinquencies of other tenants.
Next to the matter of obtaining work the rent
question is regarded as the most important by
the labouring classes; there is no privation
through which they will not pass rather than
break up their home, and their efforts to pay
their rent are often necessarily attended by a
diminution in their supply of food needful for
subsistence. Arrears of rent are more feared
than any other form of debt, and it is not
improbable that the class most benefited by the
creation of Mansion House Funds are the
tenement landlords of London. There is very
little doubt that the hatred and execration
with which landlords throughout the country
are generally regarded by the uneducated
portion of the proletariat is the result of
contact with one form of landlord, who is too often
a middle-man or sub-lessee without capital,
and who is not seldom devoid of those
qualities for which many of the great landowners
of England and <placeName key="Ireland">Ireland</placeName> have obtained the

 <pb id="p.215" n="215"/>
confidence and affection of their country
tenants. Subjoined is a letter illustrative of
this point:-
</p><p>" DEAR SIR,
"I hope you will pardon me for the
liberty I take in writing to you. I had to get
--   to write before, as I was not able
to, sir. I take the liberty of asking you if
you can assist me in my present trouble. I
had the misfortune of doing a very little work
since Christmas, which caused me to get back
in my rent. Second, my misfortune, taken
ill has still made it worse for me, making
three months at three shillings per week I
owe, sir.  My landlord is bad; he has got
five little houses down where I live. He told
me on Monday he could get no rent; he
cannot get enough out of them to pay the
taxes, so he's going to turn them out and sell
the houses; so he has told me that if I do
not pay him some this week he will put my
things into the street. Sir, if you will assist me
this time I will not trouble you again. Sir, I
have two loaves and 1s. 6d. in grocery from
the parish for me, my wife, and five children

<pb id="p.216" n="216"/>
for a week. so you see, sir, we cannot afford
to waste much of that; so if you will be so
kind as to send me a little money to help me
out of my present trouble I shall be
thankful."
</p><p>"From your humble servant,________</p><p>
There is a curious preference on the part of
most labourers for living in a room in a small
house as compared with a large barrack-like
building. It is for this reason that, while the
competition for unlet rooms in small tenement
houses is invariably keen, few, if any, of the
model dwellings situated in the midst of a
dense population are fully let; the restrictions
as to cleanliness, the disposal of rubbish, the
washing and drying of clothes, and the
regulations as to sanitary arrangements are
repugnant to the free-born Englishman or
Irishman, or, rather to the ladies of his
family; and they will prefer to pay more for
a small room where they are let alone, than
for apartments in a poor man's palace, where
they are inspected and harassed by
injunctions to a cleanly and an orderly life. There
is always a charm in Alsatia; and those of
.       <pb id="p.217" n="217"/>
the tenement landlords of London who make
their pound of flesh the chief object in life
are thoroughly aware of this fact, trade on it,
and reap their reward. Of the &#x00A3; 10 8s. paid
as rent, therefore, I estimate that at least
&#x00A3; 1 0s. 9d. is paid over and above the amount
necessary to replace capital, a sinking fund
for depreciation, and interest of five per cent.;
but it is difficult to say how the poor man's
budget can be reduced on the expenditure
side by this amount until the Legislature
takes vigorous measures with regard to the
alienation of responsibility to sub-lessees by
superior landlords.</p><p>
Butcher's meat is generally enjoyed on
Sunday only, when it is either bought for
cash at the cheap butcher's on Saturday night,
or at small chandler's shops, which now
supply bread, meat, and milk, as well as tea,
bacon, sugar, oatmeal, butter, and flour.
Minute quantities of food are sold at these
chandlers' shops. Milk, for example, can be
obtained at one farthing the half-quarter
that is, the eighth of a pint. Fish is eaten on
Friday, even by Protestants, but it is not
considered nourishing, and there is no great

<pb id="p.218" n="218"/>
liking for it in any form, unless fried, and this:
mostly among the lads and young men. In
the evenings the fried fish shops are crowded
by this latter class, who make a hearty meal
on the odoriferous viands prepared in full
view.</p><p>
The dinner taken by our scaffoldman to
his work will generally consist of bread and
cheese with a rasher of bacon on most days,
with perhaps some cold meat on Monday, the
remains of Sunday's dinner. If the wife goes
out during the week to earn a shilling or two
by some cleaning or charing work, he will
mend his fare with meat in the course of the
week. The appetites of these out-of-door
labourers are enormous, unless they are
addicted to drink more heavily than the
typical case of a man whose budget is being
considered.</p><p>
To maintain the family health, viz., two
adults and three children, will cost not less
than thirteen shillings a week, of which not
less than one shilling is the tribute to
defective methods of distribution.</p><p>
The next item of importance is coals.
These are obtained in small quantities;

      <pb id="p.219" n="219"/>
often as little as 7lbs. avoirdupois being
fetched at one time. The price of this coal
is one penny for 7lbs., which amounts to
&#x00A3; 1 6s. 8d. a ton. The coal is generally
inferior, some of it dust, and a good deal of
slag or stone. About one quarter of a
hundredweight will be used daily, and will
cost a shilling to fifteenpence per week; he
will thus spend about &#x00A3;3 0s. 8d. in fuel in the
course of the year, including wood, candles,
and matches; the former of these he often
obtains as an acknowledged perquisite from
the place where he is employed.
Thirtyseven per cent. of this expenditure is due to
imperfect distribution, as the coal for which
he pays at the rate of &#x00A3;1 6s. 8d. per ton
would not be worth, if delivered by the ton,
more than fifteen or sixteen shillings, and
this notwithstanding that our scaffoldman or
some member of his family has to fetch his coal
from the greengrocer's or chandler's shop.
</p><p>Clothes form the next item, which, at least
in the summer time, is less serious than the
provision of boots.  Children's clothing is
bought in Leather Lane and Somers Town
cheaply, by middle-men from factors, and resold

<pb id="p.220" n="220"/>
on Saturday night or Sunday morning in the
open street or at small wardrobe shops at
considerable profit. The price, however, of
these clothes is but small, and the
expenditure one week with another does not exceed
fifteenpence a week for the family. With
boots, however, the matter is different. Boots
are a necessity to the bread-winner, and there
is considerable shame felt if the children are
obliged to attend school shoeless, or with
their foot-coverings in an unusually
dilapidated condition. It is not unusual to contract
with a shoemaker for a contract supply of
boot leather for the family all the year round,
including repairs, at a sum not exceeding a
shilling or fourteenpence a week.</p><p>
The budget expenditure for the week now
amounts to &#x00A3;1 5s. 8d., leaving sevenpence for
newspapers, indulgences, treats, holidays,
presents, subscriptions, club, music-hall, pew-rent,
postage, books, charity, hospitality, repair of
furniture, and other incidentals of family life.
It will thus be seen that intermission of work,
or the confinement of the house-mother, or
illness of the bread-winner will plunge the
family in the full blast of the north wind. A
 <pb id="p.221" n="221"/>
resort to the pawnshop is, in such an event,
a matter of necessity, and here the loans of
the poor man are only effected on payment of
interest which would be regarded as usurious
in another class of society. A movement has
been made lately for the purpose of
introducing into England the system of the Mont du
Pi&#x00E9;t&#x00E9;, and at all events it can hardly be
denied that " <title>The Pawnbrokers" Act of <date value="1872">1872</date></title>
needs revision.</p><p>
The direct or indirect taxes paid by the
scaffolder to the State are very small, except
on spirits, beer, tobacco, and tea. He is
more lightly taxed than his Continental
brother.  But of his income of &#x00A3;68 5s.,
assuming he is in work all the year round, he
pays &#x00A3;7 9s. 1d. in virtue of his inability to
purchase many household requisites and his
own luxuries at the same rate as is possible
to those possessing capital.</p><p>
From this state of things it is evident that
retail quantities of stores at wholesale prices
is the principal method by which society can
help the poor working man. Co-operation in
the ordinary sense of the term involves
proprietary interest and permanent residence.

<pb id="p.222" n="222"/>
Neither of these conditions is present in the
case of the scaffolder. No spare cash is
available for investment, and he is nomadic
in his habits by the exigencies of his work.
Twenty per cent. of the London electorate
changed their residences between
<date value="1885-11">November,1885</date>, and  <date value="1886-07">July,1886</date>; the majority of these
changes being the poorer class of the voters.</p><p>
It is therefore essential, if the blessings of
co-operation (which have proved so signally
useful to the residential artizans and millhands
of the Midland counties) are to be extended
to the poor urban population, that the
organization and administration must be
undertaken and the funds provided by others.
Some, at all events, of the poor shop-keepers
who would be disestablished by the change
could be engaged as salesmen.  For ten
thousand pounds the retail meat trade of
<placeName key="East End">the East End</placeName> could be revolutionized in
favour of the indigent customer. Under any
circumstances it would be well, were funds
available for such a purpose, to proceed
strictly on commercial lines, and to divorce
the measures taken from the taint of
ineffective philanthropy.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="Chapter XI: The Unemployed" id="c11">
<head>CHAPTER XI: The Unemployed</head>
<p>THE one feature of the permanent distress
ruling amongst the working classes, to which
public notice is most forcibly drawn, is the
existence of a large and destitute class,
outside the poor-houses, without employment
or visible means of existence. This plant of
evil growth ripens in the winter; not only
because the building trades cease, and the
summer occupations of casual labourers come
to a standstill, but because the physical
contrast presented between the lives of capitalists
and of labourers, at this season of the year,
is too vivid to be wholly ignored.  The
customary method of expressing a sense of

<pb id="p.224" n="224"/>
sympathy with labour in distress is the
performance of a winter masquerade at the
Mansion House, by which pauperization of
the people is rubbed into their lives a little
more deeply, and the flames of hatred
between the Haves and the Not-haves fanned
a little higher. Opinion is divided as to the
real effect of these hurriedly obtained funds.
Optimists hold that, by collecting in panic
and distributing in haste, society has nobly
done its duty to the poor. Pessimists
contend that the wrong people manage to obtain
the bulk of the money, and that so far as the
administration of such a fund has any effect
at all, the effect is wholly and indisputably
evil. It is probable that the truth lies
midway between the optimist and the pessimist
point of view-that neither real good nor
immediate harm accrues from the distribution of
a few shillings to families in a chronic state of
misery and degradation.  It is difficult to
understand how either immediate good or
immediate harm can result from the
distribution of a few pence or shillings to people who,
after consuming the charity, are neither better
nor worse for having enjoyed it. A moderate

       <pb id="p.225" n="225"/>
estimate places the number of souls in London
who are at hand-grips with necessity at half
a million. Seventy thousand pounds divided
among this multitude amounts to two shillings
and sevenpence each. It is probable that
the only permanent effect of a Mansion House
fund is to burden the next generation with a
few hundreds of the unfit, who, but for the
existence of the fund, would either never have
entered the world, or would have gone out of
it under the irresistible operation of natural
law. The fecundity of starving people is
notorious, and has again and again been
exemplified in famine districts in India. A
policy based on relief from funds collected in
a hurry, and administered by machinery raised
in a night, can be but a temporary policy.
The evil grows by what it feeds on. We may
therefore look forward with some certainty to
the final discredit and breakdown of the
system of meeting the unemployed problem
by cheque charity. The one justification for
a Mansion House emergency fund is the
patient and contemporaneous construction of
machinery for permanently dealing with the
question.</p><p>

<pb id="p.226" n="226"/>
The saddest side of the unemployed problem
is the existence of a large and growing class
of persons who refuse to be driven by any
privation to seek assistance from the Poor
Law. The independence and resolve evinced
by such a spirit deserve the support of the
community. Governments bent on
maintaining a sense of manly independence in the
people would, in the long days of summer,
prepare for the inevitable strain of winter troubles.
Any relaxation of the rule which requires as a
condition of relief to able-bodied male persons
the entry to the workhouse, or the performance
of an adequate task of work as a labour test,
would be disastrous. Such relaxation would
tend to restore the vicious state of things
before the reform of the Poor Laws, when the
independence of the labouring classes had
practically ceased to exist, and the poor-rates
were increased so as to become an
insupportable burden.</p><p>
Distress in London is not the distress of a
great city-it is the distress of a great
Empire. If a Yorkshire yokel is dismissed
from employment because machinery performs
work formerly effected by men, he is as likely

  <pb id="p.227" n="227"/>
to come to London as to Leeds. Distressed
British seamen from all parts of the world
make for the Port of London. If I am right
in contending that the imperial character of
metropolitan distress destroys any just
comparison between it and the distress of
provincial towns, the conclusion is inevitable that
exceptional-because imperial distress-can
be met only by exceptional-that is, by
imperial measures.</p><p>
There are two considerations which lend
support to the view now advanced, upon
which some detailed examination will not be
out of place.</p><p>
The Government of the City of London
glories in a great historic position, and in the
possession of privileges more extended than
those of any town in the Empire. It shares
the administration of the province of houses
from which it derives its name, with the
<orgName key="Metropolitan Board of Works">Metropolitan Board of Works</orgName>, <orgName key="Vestry Boards">Vestry Boards</orgName>,
<orgName key="District Boards">District Boards</orgName>, <orgName key="the Home Office">the Home Office</orgName>, the Local
Government Board, and <orgName key="the Social-Democratic
Federation">the Social-Democratic
Federation</orgName>. The only municipality in London
is the Corporation of the City, and although
it enjoys a complete power of internal reform,

<pb id="p.228" n="228"/>
it retains customs inconsistent with the
principles of the Municipal Corporations Act.
As a matter of fact, and possibly in
consequence of clinging to the forms of other days,
the Corporation of London is out of touch
with the main body of the citizens; and its
place, as the leader and mouthpiece of the
capital of the Empire, is not filled either by
<orgName key="the Metropolitan Board of Works">the Metropolitan Board of Works</orgName> or any of
the vestries or boards who, by a fiction of
the law, are credited with exercising the
functions of the local authorities. The net result
of the confusion and rivalry existing between
the various bodies charged with the
administration of the affairs of London, is the
administrative impotence of the Capital in such
matters as providing for the unemployed, but
which is done with complete success in <placeName
key="Birm
ingham">Birmingham</placeName>, <placeName key="Glasgow">Glasgow</placeName>, and other great cities in
the United Kingdom.</p><p>
Since there is no municipality to whom the
unemployed can address themselves, it follows
that, pending the creation of a London
Government, the Queen's Minister is, whether he
likes it or not, in loco parentis to the
unmanageable masses of unemployed gathered
on the poor man's side of the <placeName key="Thames">Thames</placeName>.
         <pb id="p.229" n="229"/>
The other argument for invoking
temporarily the action of the Government under
the special and exceptional circumstances of
the case, is the fact that the provision of a
Mansion House fund, which averts civil war
for the time being, not only falls on a
few generous, patriotic, and public-spirited
citizens whose names are found in every good
work, but it relieves the Vestries and the
Boards of Guardians from duties thrown on
them by the law, and which they are only too
anxious and willing to evade. The guardians
of the poor, in guarding the rates, become
the guardians of the rich rather than of the
poor.</p><p>
Before entering into the consideration of
what can be done for the permanent benefit
of the unemployed, it will be well to analyse
the materials from which the army of
unemployed is created. The analysis I am
about to give is the result of personal
examination into the circumstances of about six
thousand men, who, presumably unable to
afford fourpence for shelter in a common
lodging-house, were found wandering
throughout the winter nights foodless and without a
place to lay their heads. I do not pretend

<pb id="p.230" n="230"/>
that this analysis is exhaustive, or that more
value should be attached to the opinion of a
mere individual than is deserved by an effort
to arrive at truth at the cost of many all-night
wanderings in the streets of London during
the winter season.</p><p>
Forty per cent. of these night nomads were,
in a national sense, hopelessly submerged.
They were often affected with   disease,
infected with lice, and bore the marks of
Cain upon their countenance. They are the
pariahs of civilization. Irregular meals,
uncleanly habits, and the loathly environment in
which they live, render them physically
incapable of doing an honest day's work.
Petty crimes are perpetrated by people of this
class as one means of existence, and they are
partly maintained by the system of bat-eyed
benevolence which gratifies its own selfish
emotions at the cost of generations to come.
The casual wards always contain specimens
of this class. They are the unfittest of the
unfit, and are to be dealt with permanently
only by sterilization. For this purpose they
must be regarded as the enemies of society,
and, as in the case of repeatedly convicted

      <pb id="p.231" n="231"/>
criminals, should be segregated for life, or
until such time as the danger to posterity
from the perpetuation of their species had
passed away.</p><p>
The next 40 per cent. have not fallen to so
low a level. Emaciated with want, they retain
some moral sense of the dignity of
manhood. They are capable of performing two
or three hours' work of descriptions not
demanding the exercise of skill. But their
labour does not possess such competitive
value as would enable them to assume a
serious part in the work of the world. Intimate
relations seem to exist between the physical
and moral states of this class of the
unemployed. Fed and clothed into fitness and
decency, they quickly become as other men
are, and resume the cheery demeanour and
alertness characteristic of the Londoner when
relieved from the pressure of immediate want.
There is not much that can be done by
public means for the benefit of the majority
of the class now under review. The function
of the State is not primarily to save the lives
of the unfit-from whatsoever cause
unfitness may arise. They are proper subjects for

<pb id="p.232" n="232"/>
the personal friendship of those with whom
fortune has been more kindly. A cheque
from an unknown hand, absorbed in the
maalstr&#x00F6;m of a central fund, dispensed
under ironclad rules by scientific hands,
excites neither gratitude nor surprise. Let
every man and woman who can do so
seek out and save, by personal contact and
patient sympathy, some poor soul blighted
by hereditary taint, or maimed by the cold
steel of the Manchester school
cheapnessworship.  Sharing will be found far more
effectual than doling, and more seemly as
between friends. There is a house in <placeName key="the West
End of London">the West
End of London</placeName>, full of art and beauty, where
the harvest of the eye is full and rich. From
time to time this house is opened to the poor
men and poor women, whose usual lot is to
be wedged in the hopeless dulness of <placeName key="the
East End">the
East End</placeName>.  Not served below stairs with
condescending patronage, but welcomed as
honoured guests in beautiful reception-rooms,
among the palms and the orchids, the tazze,
and the paintings, many a poor man has first
dimly learned the lesson that, after all,
the true brotherhood is not inconsistent with

    <pb id="p.233" n="233"/>
orders and rank in society; and that
differences in birth, culture, and intelligence, are
no bars to a common faith in the Teacher of
the Mount, and to the practice of His
teachings.</p><p>
The larger portion of the remaining 20 per
cent. consists of soldiers. Large numbers of
men who have served the Queen in recent
campaigns are compelled on wet and snowy
nights to tramp the streets because they have
nowhere to get a crust or a shelter. Trades
are not learned in the army so as to enable
ex-soldiers to compete with skilled and
energetic men engaged for the whole of their
lifetime in the practice of one employment.
Trades acquired in the services do not, except
in special cases, enable the learners to obtain
a subsequent livelihood. Many men leaving
the army are practically homeless, and as the
scanty store of money taken with them
melts away, they gravitate to the banks
of the Thames, and become rivals for work,
which only one in three can succeed in
obtaining.</p><p>
It would be impertinent to express an opinion
as to the military effect of the short-service

<pb id="p.234" n="234"/>
system. The effect, however, on the
condition of the lives of the poor has been
disastrous, from all points of view. A man who is
fit to serve the Queen must be physically and
morally superior to the vast proportion of the
urban population into which he sinks when
discharged from his regiment. His discharge
is attended, in the majority of instances, by
relapse into hopeless poverty. The number
of soldiers among the unemployed is appalling.
They crowd the casual wards, and are found
in every employment where skill is not
required. The efforts of these poor fellows to
obtain work are as gallant as their active
service; but they are weighted with the burden
of a career, which, however honourable on the
lips of festive speakers after dinner, disables
them in their search for employment. If a
man is borne on the roll of the first or second
class of the <orgName key="Army Reserve">Army Reserve</orgName>, his chance of
employment is lessened; for, since every petty
&#x00E9;neute abroad has involved calling up the
second line of defence-as much as though
we were menaced with grave national danger
-employers naturally refrain from engaging
men who at any moment are liable to be with have

<pb id="p.235" n="235"/>
drawn from positions of more or less trust and
importance. Sometimes the anguish of mind
following the hopelss search for work induces
men who have faithfully served Queen and
country, and who have been turned on to
the world with a good character and with
enough to retard quick starvation, to end
their troubles by self destruction. In <date value="1886-07">July,
1886,</date> the suicide of an ex-soldier was
reported in a brief newspaper paragraph
between a description of the escapade of a
fashionable actress and a list of the winning
mounts of a fashionable jockey. In the
pocket of the corpse was a paper, and written
on it wer these words: "Died of a broken heart;
unable to get work."
</p><p>So long as England is able to buy for
seventy thousand pounds a picture, considered
by some critics not of the highest class
or to defend one Irish landlord at a cost to the
country of three thousand pounds a year, the
needless death of a one man who has served his
country, and the general condition of the
 whole class of ex-soldiers, is a stain on the
 character of the country. I do not believe it
 is the will fo the English people that men who


<pb id="p.236" n="236"/>
 served the Queen, especially those who
have faced danger of foreign foe in battle, or
of a pestilential climate, should be cast out
like drafted hounds. If any man be entitled
to employment by the State, surely it is he
who has served the State, in danger to
himself, both well and faithfully.  The minor
posts in the civil service should be reserved
for competent men of good character
discharged from the army, and should no longer
be dealt with by the patronage of ministers,
or wholly in conformity with the teachings of
the Manchester school.</p><p>
Another component portion of the twenty
per cent. of the unemployed now being
considered is the class of men who have been
artizans earning their living by skill in the
use of tools. Too large a family, illness, or
depression of trade, and the compulsory sale
of tools, have forcedthem to relinquish the
exercise of skill, and sink into the ranks of
mere labourers.  The sufferings of these
men are acute: and their pluck and patience
is most pathetic. Unaccustomed, as
agricultural labourers are accustomed, to hard and
grinding toil, they quickly become submerged,

<pb id="p.237" n="237"/>
never to regain their former position. Often
they are men whose minds are equipped with
some measure of education, and they are
proudly resolute not to taint their mouths
with workhouse bread. Alms are sometimes
offered to this class, and the hand that offers
it is cursed, while the proffered gift is refused
with scorn. These are the men who form
the most effective material in the
manufacture of the <orgName key="Social-Democratic party">Social-Democratic party</orgName>.
Failure only partly attributable to the
community is by them placed wholly on the
shoulders of Society-and nothing short of
industrial revolution is held by them to be a
satisfactory or adequate solution of the
problems of their bitter lives.</p><p>
Then come the agricultural labourers from
all parts of the kingdom, who in entering
London exchange a hard lot for one that is
hopeless. The whisper of a Mansion House
fund blackens the North Road with swarms
of these poor fellows, who, aimlessly and
unprevented, swell the ranks of the
competitive army of the soldiers of unskilled
labour. In three months their rural
characteristics have disappeared, and in six they

<pb id="p.238" n="238"/>
are permanently absorbed into the floating
population of the great city.</p><p>
The only method of dealing with the
agricultural classes who flock to the towns,
attracted by the magnetism of a great mass,
is to divert them from the country to the
Colonies.  Emigration is practically at a
standstill. Colonization, therefore, is the only
method of dealing with the surplus rural
population, and there is perhaps no method
by which the permanent good of all classes
of the community is more effectually secured,
than by the organization of settlements such
as that dealt with in the chapter on
Colonization.</p><p>
This analysis of a few thousands of night
nomads shows that besides the soldiers and
the agricultural labourers, to be dealt with by
colonization and State employment
respectively, there is a large body of men who have
drifted to London as much from
thoughtlessness as from design. These people being
rooted in the Metropolis, are those upon
whom the punishment of a cold winter and
general depression tells with the most
unerring certainty.  The labour test usually

       <pb id="p.239" n="239"/>
imposed by the parish authorities is
stonebreaking or oakum-picking.   This work
is selected as offering but little competition
with other labour. But it presses hardly on
skilled artizans, and impairs their proficiency
in their own trades. Spade labour is less
open to objection, but it is not often that
Guardians are either able or willing to supply
the unemployed with the opportunity of
working with the spade or shovel. What is
required is work that all able-bodied men can
perform; which does not compete with other
employments; and which is not likely to
interfere with the resumption of regular
employment in their own trades by those who
are compelled by necessity to seek for aid.
As regards <placeName key="East End">the East End</placeName> parishes, it is not
reasonable to expect that ratepayers should
bear the burden of providing relief works for
men who, as has been shown, flock in from
all parts of the Empire. East End rates are
normally higher than the rates of other parts
of London. Pending the equalization of the
rates for the whole of the metropolis, it is not
likely that local authorities will willingly
embark in schemes for the relief of distress

<pb id="p.240" n="240"/>
accidentally falling within the area of their
own administration. The belated advice of
the Local Government Board, from time to
time distributed with ineffectual wisdom, is
naturally ignored. The Board has no power
of constraint.</p><p>
It is difficult to resist the conclusion that
under the special circumstances of the case,
i.e., the absence of a Municipality for
London, the impotence of the local
authorities, and the grave evils attending the
helterskelter administration of charitable
fundsthe Government must accept a
responsibility in London which they do not seek to
evade in India. Plans for the employment of
Indian labour in districts liable to famine are
in readiness throughout the three
Presidencies. I fail to see why provisions held to be
necessary in the case of our Hindoo and
Mahometan fellow-subjects should be
superfluous or unwise when dealing with
Englishmen and their families.  Irish distress is
articulate through the voices of Irish Members
of Parliament, and measures for the relief of
distress in the sister island receive the
approval of all parties and of all creeds. What

       <pb id="p.241" n="241"/>
is done for Ireland and for India should not
be left undone for London.</p><p>
If, on reviewing all the circumstances of
the case, spade labour be considered most
suitable to the needs of a starving population,
the defences of London would appear the
most appropriate object for the expenditure
of funds intended to be applied to the relief
of distress. It cannot be pretended that relief
works of this nature would be pecuniarily
remunerative.  It is undesirable that they
should be directly remunerative. The erection
of forts and earth-works would compete with
no other employment; would not involve the
possession of skill; and would be carried out
beyond the confines of the metropolitan area.
Payment should be made largely in kind, and,
if necessary, <title>the Truck Act</title> should be
modified with this object. No Act of Parliament
would be needed for the erection of forts on
land already in possession of the War Office,
and preparations for the camp of labour to be
employed can be organized in a few weeks.
Ministries have again and again incurred
expenditure on wars, and preparations for war,
for which they were subsequently obliged to
<pb id="p.242" n="242"/>
obtain an indemnity from Parliament. There
appear to be no fundamental objections to
the plan of temporarily providing for the
able-bodied unemployed by completing the
defences of London. The rates of wages
paid, either in money or in kind, should be
so arranged as not to attract labourers from
other employments, and idlers refusing the
honourable work thus provided should be
allowed to take the consequences of their
idleness. The habit of idleness is so rooted
in the nature of a small portion of the
population that they will incur privation, resort to
malingering, steal-in short, do anything
rather than apply themselves to win their
bread by the sweat of their brow.</p><p>
It is probable that the organization of relief
works on some such plan as this would reduce
the distress of able-bodied men to
manageable dimensions. The wives and families of
the men employed would no doubt need
assistance, which could be rendered by
arranging for the payment to the wives of a
portion of the wages earned by the men on
the same system of deposit notes and
remittances as is adopted on behalf of seamen

       <pb id="p.243" n="243"/>
in the navy and mercantile marine.  The
work would be of so hard and disagreeable a
nature that none would resort to it except in
extremity. On the other hand the taint of
the poor-law and workhouse relief would
be abolished, and men employed would
preserve their independence in reflecting that
the work on which they were engaged was
one of national importance and of the highest
necessity.</p><p>
Some military authorities are of opinion
that the creation of a system of defence for
the metropolis and its approaches is by itself
a matter that should no longer be postponed,
and that without reference to the state of the
labour market the accessibility of London to
hostile forces constitutes a grave and national
danger.  Whether or not this view of the
case be correct, it is clear that there is an
opportunity of ensuring the safety of London
and of its prodigious wealth under
circumstances exceptionally favourable to the
National Exchequer, and at the same time of
reducing the proportions of a calamity with
which we are menaced from within.</p><p>
To recapitulate some of the measures

<pb id="p.244" n="244"/>
needed to solve the problem of the
unemployed, the following steps may be among
those to be adopted with advantage:-</p><p>
(1). The institution  under War Office
management of a system of metropolitan
defences.</p><p>
(2). The organization of agricultural
settlements in the Colonies for labourers driven
from the soil.</p><p>
(3) The employment of ex-soldiers in the
petty offices of the civil service.</p><p>
(4). The administration of charity,
whenever practicable, by the givers themselves or
their agents, and under no circumstances
resort to centralized funds, care being taken
by organization to prevent " over-lapping."</p>

CHAPTER XII</head>
<div2 type="subchapter" n="Charities" id="c12s1"><p>
THE annual revenue of the metropolitan
charities is greater than the whole of the
expenditure in  <placeName key="Sweden">Sweden</placeName>, on  maintaining
royalty, the administration of justice and
foreign affairs, Army and Navy, internal,
educational, and ecclesiastical affairs, and in
providing interest on the Swedish debt. It
is difficult to say whether in the long run the
community would be benefited or prejudiced
by the complete and immediate stoppage of
all charitable subscriptions to benevolent
societies. On the one hand, acute suffering
would be caused to individuals, though the
death of many of the unfit would be
advantageous to succeeding generations. Large

<pb id="p.246" n="246"/>
bodies of clerks, secretaries, and salaried
administrators would be thrown out of
employment, but the money employed in paying
them would be available for more useful
objects. Looking to the large sums expended
in London charities, and to the amount of
distress ascertained to exist, it is probable
that the money actually provided is more
than sufficient to meet the necessities of
those who are proper subjects for the exercise
of private charity.</p><p>
The defects in the present system  of
charitable administration are three in number:</p><p>
(1) the competition raging between weak
institutions carrying on similar work with
separate machinery; (2) the enormous sums
wasted in administrative expenses and
advertisements; (3) the absence of any palpable
relation between charitable work and
endowment and their effects on the solution of the
social problem, and therefore on the welfare
of the community. Take, for example, the
sum of &#x00A3;312,000 a year which is expended
on institutions for General Relief. No doubt
much individual misery is temporarily relieved.
The other side of the picture lies in the
            <pb id="p.247" n="247"/>
wholesale destruction of the sense of parental
responsibility for the physical and mental
welfare of children brought into the world,
and the creation of confirmed habits of
dependence on charitable doles in a class
increasing its numbers with greater rapidity
than the independent and self-supporting
classes from which the bone and sinew of the
nation are recruited.</p><p>
With regard to the competition between
charitable institutions pursuing identical aims,
the evil is not so great. The mere waste of
money, and the prostitution of a sacred
idea, exhibited in the profane avidity with
which rival institutions clamour for public
help are not matters of national importance.
Take, for example, the twenty-six charities
for the Blind, costing &#x00A3;55,677 a year. It is
impossible not to believe that improved
administration, greater economy, and increased
usefulness would result from a fusion between
the different interests, conducted on lines
precisely similar to those followed in the case
of Railway or Insurance Companies, where
the proprietory is bent on effecting an
amalgamation between rival interests.</p><p>

<pb id="p.248" n="248"/> </p><p>
Or take the  &#x00A3;108,470 a year spent on
twenty-nine miscellaneous special hospitals.
It is difficult for a layman to understand what
advantage can accrue to the
communitywhatever may be the effect on the interests
of individual specialists-in the multiplication
of the existing hospital system by
miscellaneous special hospitals issuing separate
appeals to the public for support. It should
be explained that besides the seventeen
General Hospitals, commanding the support
of the charitable, there are eight Consumption
Hospitals, five Ophthalmic, three Orthopedic,
three Skin, twenty-one for Women and
Children, and six Lying-in Hospitals.  In
addition to these, twenty-nine miscellaneous
hospitals, to which objection is taken, are
instituted for the most part with special
reference to the diseases of particular organs,
which can be as efficiently, and certainly more
widely and economically, studied and treated
in a large General than in a small Special
hospital. The medical profession have
deserved so well, and have received so little from
the community, as compared with the legal
and the clerical professions, it is somewhat invidious

           <pb id="p.249" n="249"/>
 to venture on suggestions for the
reorganization of a portion of the existing
medical machinery of the metropolis. The
first and almost the special point in which
civilization contrasts with barbarism, consists
in the tenderness and care bestowed on
infirm, unfit, and undesirable lives, tainted
with disease or maimed with deformity.
Whether on the whole the results of
applying medical science to the maintenance and
preservation of the unfit, and of improving the
sanitary conditions of daily life, are, or are not,
on the whole advantageous to the community,
need not here be discussed.   The
compassionate feelings of the wealthier classes
lead them to subscribe nearly  &#x00A3; 600,000 a
year for the benefit of ninety-two hospitals in
the metropolis.  The question is therefore
whether a federation could not be established
between the administrations of separate
mechanisms for identical objects, with the view
of dispensing from time to time with certain
hospitals where the work can be carried on
as efficiently and more economically in larger
institutions.</p><p>
The subject of charities cannot be touched

<pb id="p.250" n="250"/>
without reference to those semi-fraudulent
institutions conducted primarily as a means
of existence for their promoters, and not
for the relief of the poor. Under the present
system any letter or advertisement in the
daily papers, or a circular to the public
appealing for funds for charitable purposes,
may be inserted or issued without let or hindrance.
The law intervenes only in the event
of the mal-administration of such funds,
attracting sufficient public attention to
demand investigation and inquiry under the
Ciminal Law. So numerous are these
appeals, that the time has arrived when no
one should be permitted to make a public
appeal for charitable funds without being
subjected to the ordeal of a Public Audit.</p><p>
 The multiplication of week institutions
 seems not unlikely to receive greater impulse
 during the jubilee year of Her
 Majesty's reign. It were to be desired that
 that historic event could be perpetuated by
 the rearrangement and concentration on scientific principles of the funds obtained,
 and of the institions already in existence,
 rather than by extraction of more funds

 <pb id="p.251" n="251"/>

 from the public pocket, and by the erection
 of additional institutions for the purpose of
 doing that which is already being one in
 other quarters.
  </p><p> The need for charity shoudl diminish from
   the hour that the Problems of a freat City begin
   to undergo the process of solution.
  The poor we have awlys with us.  By the
  continuity of their existence is no ground for
  making systems of relief the instruments for
  propogating pauperisms, destroyng thrift,  relieving
  parents for their duties, and generally
  subsidising the powers of darkness.  Objectively
  considered, the existence of two or more charitable agencies occupying the same
  ground at the same time, is as irrational as if
  numberous water companies were to engage in
  the supply of water to a sinalge street. Either
  harmonious concert must exist between rival
  charities-which notoriously is not the case -
  or some of the objects of charitiable relief
  will be neglected, and others will be superfluously assisted.
 <orgName key="The society for the Organzation of Charitable
 Relief ">The society for the Organzation of Charitable
 Relief </orgName>impliues by the ambition of it stitle that it has undertaken
 the task of welding duplicate undertkaings.


<pb id="p.252" n="252"/>
pruning exuberant energies, and mapping
out the areas in which the force of disciplined
generosity can usefully expend itself.
Grappling with a task of enormous difficulty, it is
not surprising that the Society for the
Organization of Charitable Relief has neither
equalled the intentions nor adhered to the ideal
of its founders. Through evil report it has,
however, steadily pursued with English
tenacity one of the objects with which it was
founded, although the public mind is
confused by the incongruity of its functions.
One would think that an organization created
to arrange and marshal disunited energy,
would refrain from itself competing as a relief
agency with the very societies it proposes to
organize. Weighty and experienced minds
are associated with the Society for the
Organization of Charitable Relief, and to
them the public may fairly look for a new
departure in the direction indicated by the
title of the Society. Mansion House Local
Committees have shown that in times of
distress religious and political animosities can be
laid aside under the pressure of public
calamity, and under the influence of a common

          <pb id="p.253" n="253"/>
 sympathy. Permanent charitable
committees might well be organized by whom
not only the administration of charitable
relief should be undertaken within the area
allotted for their operations, but from whom
should proceed a permanent stream of
appropriate criticism of the local authorities when
neglect or corruption are shown to exist.
It has been already shown in the case of the
Emigration Societies how puerile and
wasteful is the system of numerous disunited and
feeble efforts. The circumstances detailed
in the case of the Emigration Societies apply
to many other forms of charitable endeavour.
Preliminary to better administration, must be
intelligent contact between the various circles
of charitable influence. The English public
is compassionate as a woman when its
emotions are really stirred. But the essence
of the problem of administering the immense
revenue annually raised removes the question
from emotional to intellectual regions. That
which is required, therefore, is the continuous
application on the spot of the same class of
mind to the charitable problem, as is bestowed
on the building and command of our ships;

<pb id="p.254" n="254"/>
on the administration of our railway system,
the economical and successful conduct of the
complex operations of a large and successful
business. Getting in the money is the smallest
factor in the problem.  Spending the results
obtained by frantic appeals without inflicting
actual harm on the next generation is a matter
of the greatest difficulty, and has not hitherto,
as a rule, been undertaken by persons of a
calibre comparable with that possessed by
those who succeed in business or professional
life. The principal qualification of a
charitable functionary is often held to be the
adroitness with which he relieves the public of its
cash, rather than the skill and success with
which the cash is expended.  Such
functionaries are sometimes remunerated in part
by receiving a commission on the money they
succeed in obtaining from the public ; a policy
which taints charity with the sordidness of
commerce without imparting the shrewdness
and ability characteristic of the
tradingclasses.</p><p>
Pestered, tormented, and badgered by the
practised wiles of paid philanthropists, the
charitable public are beginning to perceive
           <pb id="p.255" n="255"/>
that the subtle aroma of charity itself is prone
to disappear before arriving at its destination.
Impatience with the present system is on the
increase. People who would give generously,
if they were sure that their bounty would be
effectual in doing good, refrain from giving
because their taste and intellect revolt against
the vulgarity of the appeals with which their
support is demanded.</p><p>
Personal contact between the giver and the
object of his compassion is the only effectual
method of replacing the system of charity by
cheque-which is often no charity at all-at
all events, to posterity. People sometimes
dissipate their charities by giving a guinea
here and a guinea there, when the
concentration of a year's benevolence on one object
might remedy an evil otherwise permanent
and prolific. Sorrow and misery in the mass
are essentially subjects for intellectual and
practical, and not for emotional treatment.
The sorrow or misery of a friend, on the other
hand, is the subject for personal and
sympathetic sacrifice. Much of the muddle into
which charitable administration has fallen is
the result of confusing two opposite ideas.

<pb id="p.256" n="256"/>
As the command of a ship or a regiment
cannot be carried on by love and emotion, so the
disciplined administration of charity in the
mass can only be conducted successfully by
rigid adherence to the fundamental principles
of inexorable law. Neglect of such principles
as the inviolable sanctity of parental
responsibility; the justice of permitting free play to
the natural consequences of criminal
indolence; the effect on an innocent posterity
of the fecundity of the unfit; and the
essential differences between the province of natural
law and the province of charity or
gospelhas plunged the community into a slough of
despair, under which the enormous sums
annually provided for charitable purposes are
not only making no inroad on the troubles of
our race, but are instrumental to their
perpetuation, by the subordination of generous,
but untutored, emotions to the interests of a
paid and blundering philanthropy.</p></div2>

<head>CONCLUSION.</head>
<p>Upon the dark foundations of our human
nature shines the mysterious light of natural
law. Welded together, on a supernatural
forge, the correlation between the various
phenomena of our social life is so firmly
established as to render the separate cure
of isolated symptoms beyond the range
of the possible. The law governing the
correlation of social forces has not been
formulated. But there is no ground for belief
that universal law excepts from its dominion
the phenomena displayed in the social life of
man; or that isolated campaigns against
objective evil are not productive of results
both remoter and more important than are
dreamed of in the philosophy of those who
wage a guerilla warfare against it. Could

<pb id="p.260" n="260"/>
we but see painted on the wall a connected
panorama of the effects on future generations
produced by the remedies commonly
administered from the pharmacy of civilization,
we should leap with horror from the folly and
the wrong we now commit with gladness and
singleness of heart.</p><p>
Statesmen, administrators, philanthropists,
who live and labour for this generation and
for the present year, mobilise an invincible
array of enemies against the innocent unborn.
In tropic countries, during the season of
drought, certain forms of insect and fish life
totally disappear from the land, and become
apparently as extinct as the apteryx of
Mauritius, or the Moa of New Zealand. When
the first warm rains of the monsoon awaken
the sleeping energies of mother earth, the
microscopic eggs of insects and the tiny spawn
of fishes and of leeches, lurking invisible and
unsuspected in the sandy bottoms of
evaporated lakes while the earth is iron and the sky is
brass, leap into a lusty and a vigorous life, when
the falling rain supplies the environment
needful for their activity and for their
perfection. Not otherwise is it with the
imperishable fecundity of philanthropic and

           <pb id="p.261" n="261"/>
legislative ova. The unfit are propagated,
and posterity plagued if we ignore the
stern conditions of natural law, which, so far
as experience and research can guide us, are
inexorable, continuous, and universal in their
scope. Kindness by society to the individual
is, as often as not, cruelty to potential
individuals separated from us only by time,
but who are as worthy to receive some of the
enthusiasm of humanity as a fractional
number of contemporary lives. Well it had
been for us had our ancestors in some
measure bethought themselves of the welfare
of this generation, and had studied the
consequences both of their neglect and of
their primitive and emotional methods of
beneficence. Had they surveyed from the
higher standpoint of trustees for an improving
race the methods of stamping out heredity
of evil, and of extending to man himself the
consideration that has long been given to
improving the strain of dogs and the breed of
horses, the task of solving the Problems of a
Great City would neither be so dark nor so
difficult as it now is.  Like the lilies of
the field, we, the ruling and imperial race
among the nations of the earth, survive by

<pb id="p.262" n="262"/>
dint of a blundering and irregulated vitality,
rather than by taking thought for the morrow.
And the measure we have meted out to
ourselves we have dealt unto others.</p><p>
The production of the great tragedy that is
shaping itself on the plains of India and in
the valleys of the Ganges and the Indus (as
the consequence of English rule), cannot long
be postponed. The materials of a similar
tragedy are preparing wherever the hoof of
a godless and hypocritical civilization has
trodden underfoot the operation of natural
law. Under the reign of the Moguls periodic
famines so regulated the population of
Hindostan as to adjust the numbers of the people
to the capacity of the soil for maintaining
them.  When, more than a century since,
English rule was first generally established
throughout the Indian Peninsula, an
equilibrium between the numbers of the people and
the normal food supply was roughly but firmly
established. In good years the population
increased. In bad years the numbers of the
people  diminished.  Those who survived
numbered in the year <date value="1800">1800</date> about two hundred
million souls. From that time to this, human
life has been fostered and maintained at the

           <pb id="p.263" n="263"/>
sacrifice of all that makes life worth living.
Internecine wars have been replaced by a
universal passion for litigation between
individuals.  Famines have been minimised by
Mansion House funds and by State aid, with
such effect that the two hundred millions have
been replaced by two hundred and fifty-seven
millions of human beings. Those who would
have died under the rougher and healthier
rule of the Moguls, survive to a joyless and
prolific existence. The pressure of population
on the means of subsistence has destroyed the
village arts that flourished for centuries before
the baleful introduction of a sickly
humanitarianism. Population and pressure increase
after every famine, under the operation of
law governing the abnormal fecundity of the
unfit. Half-starved ryots survive the periodic
death only to provide constituencies for future
famines, of larger-and eventually, under
present scientific and economic conditions-of
unmanageable dimensions.</p><p>
What is the humanity that feeds thousands,
when the millions produced by feeding them
must necessarily die a starving death of
hopeless and unassuageable agony ? When the
next great Indian famine arrives, accompanied

<pb id="p.264" n="264"/>
 by abnormal modifications of the
photosphere of the sun, dim suggestions will be
offered as to the fatuity of attempting to
confront the evidence of astronomical
phenomena by the collection of a Mansion House
fund.</p><p>
The inference from such facts as these is,
that we should attempt to harmonize our
legislation and our public charities with the
inexorable tendencies of natural law, that
every member of society is irrevocably
responsible for his or her contribution to the
solution of the Problems of a Great City
(which are the problems of the race), and
cannot delegate them either to governments
or to a clerical caste; and that the
application of compassion alone, without the
telescope of thought and judgment for those we
have not seen, is to sow the dark seeds of
poisonous and eternal evil.</p><p>
When each of us admits the unsupportable
burden of participation in the pollution and
misery to which our wills have never consented,
OEdipus has been found to answer the riddle
propounded by the spirit of civilization. If
each one answers Davus sum, non OEdipus,
the mysterious monster will continue to levy

            <pb id="p.265" n="265"/>
her tribute of human lives from the B&#x00E6;otiaof
civilization. As every soul leaving England for
a foreign country is involuntarily a missionary
from his countrymen, a representative of their
habits, aspirations, and enjoyments-and as
by him, his character, and his conduct will
native races keenly assess the value and
estimate the nature of the civilization and
religion he represents-so in a complex form
of Society, such as that of a great city, is each
soul forming part of it trustee for the race
and the destinies of the race.  The lightest
act, imponderable as gossamer, is the parent of
boundless and eternal issues. The slightest
impulse and the lightest words are fraught
alike with the qualities of eternal destiny.
The period of incubation may be prolonged,
but the germs are never sterile.  Life or
death, alike unseen and unrestricted, may be
the inseparable consequences of the tiniest
action. Europe condemned M. Ollivier for
entering on war with a light heart.  As men
and women reach maturity each is told off in
a contest between the powers of evil and of
pain, and the powers of life and of light. We
do not know with assurance the nature of the

<pb id="p.266" n="266"/>
penalties following the betrayal of the trust
reposed in us; but we do know the
degradation and the corruption of national life that
have resulted from the hollow profession of a
perfect life, and from entering the terrible
contest with a " light heart."</p><p>
They are the most effectually solving the
Problems of a Great City who by life and
example add wisdom to the sacrifice of self.
The tinkling cymbal of emotional and
subsidized religion produces no large and
permanent results on the lives and characters of
the English people plunged in the sadness of
a great city. Moral revolution in the individual
is a panacea that cannot be replaced by
legislation, nor by sermons, nor by alms.
Such a revolution must begin among the
comfortable classes, who alone enjoy the
environment in which a moral change is generally
possible, and the aim of the New revolution
is the recognition by the comfortable classes
of the fact that " pure religion and undefiled
is to visit the fatherless and the widow in their
affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from
the world."</p>

<p><title>I S A:
a Nobel,
BY THE
EDITOR OF THE "NORTH EASTERN DAILY GAZETTE."
(Two Vols., Crown 8vo., 21s.)</title></p>
<p>"More power is shown in the novel 'Isa' than we have seen in many
novels of late. The author writes brilliantly, and he has told a strong and
fascinating story. ... It will have a place of its own among the novels of the
day, and it will be strange if the public do not desire to have more work from
the same pen."-Scotsman.
</p><p>" His tale is weird, and through it all there runs a vein of touching pathos
The distracted workings of the poor girl's mind are depicted with much
power."-Morning Post.
</p><p>" One of the most striking of those weird tales which have been produced
both in England and France since Edgar Allen Poe wrote his 'Mysteries' and
Eugene Sue his ' Juif Errant.' "-Belfast News Letter.
</p><p>"This is a painful, but a very powerful story. The author should have
given his name to the world, for he has no reason whatever to be ashamed of
his work, which, in fact, is one of the best novels we have seen for many a
day."-Liverpool Daily Mercury.
</p><p>" Certainly 'Isa' should be read by those who love something bold and
unconventional in fiction."-Yorkshire Post.
</p><p>"It is a clever story, well sketched and cleverly told."-Newcastle
Chronicle.
</p><p>" The story is very powerfully written."-Echo.
</p><p>" It is a wonderfully well written story ... . Those who read the two
volumes will find the time and trouble well spent."-Birmingham Daily
Gazette.
</p><p>"It is decidedly clever as a piece of mental vivisection, laying bare the
workings of the influences and emotions which produce the last sad result that
follows Isa's happy and hopeful marriage. The novel is well written, and if
there be a suspicion of tediousness in the earlier part it is more than atoned
for by the intense pathos of the closing chapter."-North British Daily Mail

<title>CROSS COUNTRY REMINISCENCES.
BY
FOX RUSSELL.
DEDICATED BY SPECIAL PERMISSION TO HIS GRACE
THE DUKE OF BEAUFORT, K.G.
(Crown 8vo., 7s. 6d.)</title>
"Mr. Russell's book is one of the freshest and most vigorous works upon
sporting subjects that we have come across for some time . . . A book which
we cordially commend to the notice of lovers of the Chase, and, indeed, of
every sport which depends upon the co-operation of that noble animal, the
horse. ... The book is not only rendered additionally attractive by a bright
and graceful style, but is further enlivened by some really capital anecdotes."
-County Gentleman.
</p><p>" It is a real pleasure to read a book like that of Mr. Fox Russell, who,
having had large experience in cross-country work, tells us, in a lively manner,
what he has seen and done, and draws his conclusions from his own
experience. .... These Reminiscences form an excellent and compendious text-book
for the instruction of beginners at cross-country work, and are right pleasant
reading for the graduates and professors of that art."-Saturday Review.
</p><p>" He affords the reader a practical insight into the pleasures of riding to
foxhounds, staghounds, draghounds, and harriers, and gives some interesting
notes upon steeplechasing and hurdle-racing, as well as upon the training of
hunters. Some merry anecdotes find a place in the book, which concludes with
the inevitable hunt dinner, described with some appreciation of humour."-
Morning Post.
</p><p>"The present sketches are written in a lively spirit, and are eminently
readable ... The author knows well what he writes about."-Glasgow
Herald.
</p><p>"All of you read Fox Russell's ' Cross-Country Reminiscences;' it is just
capital."-St. Stephen's Review.
</p><p>" He has many good stories to tell relating to hunting men and horses, and
has much to say about horses and their management that is worthy of
attention."-Leeds Mercury.

<title>ENGLAND AT WAR:
THE STORY OF THE GREAT CAMPAIGNS OF THE
BRITISH ARMY.
BY
W. H. DAVENPORT ADAMS.
(Two Vols., Demy 8vo., 25s.</title>
"His narrative of the origin of our army is clear and well told. He
accentuates the difference between the early period of our history, when every
Englishman was a soldier accustomed to, and pre-eminently skilled in the use
of his weapons, and the time when the art of war became confined in this
country to a by no means numerous profession. His work has the merit of
continuity, taking us over all the frays in which the British soldier has been
engaged, from the field of Flodden to the fights of Tel-el-Kebir and Tamanieb.
Mr. Adams has added to the historical usefulness of his work by explaining as
concisely as possible the direct and immediate causes of the wars in which our
soldiers have upheld the honour of our flag. The Author has, in our opinion,
performed a very useful task in compiling the material in these volumes, and
by telling his story in simple and straightforward fashion. 'England at
War ' would make a capital present for an intelligent boy, whose taste for
historical reading needed encouragement; and it may certainly be read with
pleasure by men who wish to brush up the knowledge of the nation's past
campaigns."-Graphic.
</p><p>" In the compass of two moderate-sized volumes the narrative, shorn of
professional technicalities and useless minuti&#x00E6;, of all important campaigns since
Flodden Field, is given with extraordinary conciseness, accuracy, and
vivacity."- Whitehall Review.
</p><p>"A work which can scarcely fail to interest all readers .... Mr. Adams
has done a service for which he deserves the gratitude of the general reader."
-Illustrated London News.
</p><p>" Mr. Davenport Adams has made a very acceptable addition to the stock
of pleasantly written fragments of English history in the two handsome
volumes entitled ' Englanld at War. ' "-Guardian.

<title>POETS' WALK.
AN INTRODUCTION TO ENGLISH POETRY, FOR
THE USE OF SCHOOLS.
CHOSEN AND ARRANGED BY
MOWBRAY MORRIS.
(Feap. 8vo., 5s.)
THIRD EDITION NOW IN THE PRESS.</title>
"This book deserves a place beside Mr. Thackeray's Greek and Latin
anthologies as one in which literature, and not merely instruction, is aimed
at. The extracts, which are plenteous, prettily printed, and furnished with
annotation confined very judiciously to the minimum of needful explanation,
are well selected."-Athenaum.
</p><p>"The volume has a character of its own which renders it equally attractive
to readers of all ages. No better work of the kind has ever been published;
very few have been published which are half so good. The volume, it should
be added, is beautifully printed, prettily bound, and of manageable size."-
World.
</p><p>"Mr. Morris's little book is much more than moderately well selected..
As a gift-book for leisure hours it is equally well suited.. .  Mr. Morris has
made his selections with excellent taste."--Pall Mall Gazette.
</p><p>" There can be no question that Mr. Morris has exercised his editorial
function wisely and well."-Scotsman
</p><p>"Anthologies of the British poets have been frequent since the
halfforgotten days of 'Elegant Extracts,' but we have seldom met with a better
than 'Poets' Walk' by Mowbray Morris. It is avowedly intended to cultivate
a taste in the minds of boys, and is excellently well-suited for the purpose, as
the selection has been carefully made."-Morning Post.
</p><p>"If the book is not extensively given as a present and prize-book it will be
a pity; no recent book of the kind known to us is so well fitted for the purpose."
-Manchester Guardian.

<title>SOME PRESS OPINIONS UPON THE FIRST
EDITION OF
PROBLEMS OF A GREAT CITY.</title>
" Mr. Arnold White strikes with good effect at the root of
things evil. There cannot be any doubt that the ugly facts
and figures adduced by the author imperatively demand the
inquiry of a Royal Commission."-Saturday Review.
</p><p>" Mr. Arnold White puts forth a volume wherein the
difficulties of our modern citizenship are boldly grappled with."-
Daily Telegraph.
</p><p>" Mr. Arnold White has a high ideal, and his work, his
influence, and his book will all undoubtedly do good, and may
do much good."-Athen&#x00E6;um.
</p><p>" The motive of Mr. Arnold White's ' Problems of a Great
City' is admirable, and his treatment of his subject leaves
little to be desired."- Graphic.
</p><p>" There is much in this book that may be read with profit
by those who desire to know more about the problems of life
among their poorer brethren."-Morning Post.
</p><p>"Mr. White's ideas are clearly expressed, and he supports
them by an array of facts skilfully marshalled and selected."
-Pall Mall Gazette.
</p><p>"Mr. White uses no honeyed phrases ; he puts things as they
are."- Whitehall Review.
</p><p>" Mr. White has written a thoughtful and careful essay on
a subject which is every year attracting more and more
attention."-Newcastle Chronicle.
</p><p>"Mr. White's work is an exceedingly valuable one, and we
wish the well-fed philosophers, who snugly rub their hands
and fancy that all is well, could be induced to read it."-
Christian World.
</p><p>" The volume is a highly valuable one and will not have
been written in vain."-Christian.
